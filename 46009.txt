  KING HENRY VIIIth's HOUSEHOLD BOOK, being an Account of the Privy
    Purse expenses of Henry VIII. from November, 1529, to December
    1532; now first printed from the original MS.; with Notes and
    Illustrations by NICHOLAS HARRIS NICOLAS, Esq. F.S.A. 8vo. price
    1_l._ 1_s._

      This volume abounds in curious particulars, illustrative not
      only of the Manners, Customs, and Expenses of the time, but,
      to some extent, of the personal character of Henry the Eighth.
      From it may be traced where the King was on each day during the
      above period, his occupations, and amusements, together with the
      names of the persons composing his household, their wages, and
      the cost of their dresses, &c. It likewise contains numerous
      entries relative to Ann Boleyn, and the information which they
      afford respecting her are both new and important. Among other
      items are the sums paid for jewels, books, furniture, clothes,
      &c.; the charges of the King's Fools and Jester; and the expenses
      attendant on his Majesty's interview with Francis I at Calais,
      in October, 1532. Each month's account is examined and signed
      by the King. The following persons are particularly mentioned:
      Cardinal Wolsey; Cromwell, Earl of Essex; the Marquess of Exeter;
      the Princess, afterwards Queen Mary; Thomas Boleyn, Earl of
      Wiltshire; his son, Lord Rochford; the first Earl and Countess
      of Bedford; the Earl of Derby; the Protector Somerset; Bishop
      Latimer; the Duke of Norfolk; Sir Richard Gresham; Sir Anthony
      Browne; Sir Francis Bryan; Sir Francis Weston; Sir Henry Norris;
      Brereton; and the notorious Mark Smeton; Domingo; Sexton, the
      Fool, &c. &c.

PREFACE.


The following pages present an account of the sums paid out of the
Privy Purse of King Henry VIII. from the 17th of November, 1529, to
the end of December, 1532; and as every payment, whether for the daily
expenses of the Royal establishments, or for the gratification of His
Majesty's wishes, is minutely noticed, it must be evident that they
afford interesting information, not merely on the general customs and
manners of the times, but on the personal character of that monarch,
his occupations, amusements, and places of residence.

Among the materials for History, private Letters have, long since,
been deemed of the utmost value; but the curious facts contained in
records like those now introduced to the notice of the public, have not
obtained the attention which they deserve: hence it will not perhaps
be irrelevant to give a brief account of the few works of this nature
which have been printed, as well as of some which still remain in
Manuscript.

The first in point of time, is the "Liber Quotidianus Contrarotulatoris
Garderobae, Anno Regni Regis Edwardi Primi Vicesimo Octavo: A. D. 1299
and 1300," printed in 1787 by the Society of Antiquaries, from a MS. in
their library. This volume which is but partially known, abounds in
highly interesting information, illustrative of the History, Manners,
Expences, Army, Navy, Provisions, Costume, &c. of the thirteenth
century; and as an adjunct to Historical and Antiquarian inquiries, it
cannot be too highly estimated. Few MSS. have been so well edited; but
amidst much ground for praise, it is to be regretted that it does not
contain an Index, an omission which considerably lessens its utility.
Another MS. of the same kind, of the 31st and 32nd years of Edward
the First, is also extant,[1] but it has never been printed. In 1790
the Society of Antiquaries published "A Collection of Ordinances and
Regulations for the Government of the Royal Household, made in divers
reigns, from King Edward III. to King William and Queen Mary," and
which is copiously cited in the Notes to this work. Only one more
publication of the sort remains to be noticed, the Household Book of
Henry Algernon Percy, Fifth Earl of Northumberland, which appeared
privately in 1770, edited by Bishop Percy, and which has been recently
reprinted by the Publisher of this volume.

Independently, however, of Household expences which occur in
separate volumes, many have been printed in other works. Of these
it will be sufficient to refer to the few which are to be found in
the "Archaeologia," in County Histories, and more particularly, the
Household payments of the family of Kytson in Mr. Gage's admirable
"History and Antiquities of Hengrave." Although not more than four
accounts of the expenditure of sovereigns or individuals have been
published, those which are known to exist in MS. are both numerous and
valuable. Besides those of the 31st and 32nd of Edward I. which have
just been mentioned, four large volumes of the kind are preserved in
the Chapter House: one containing the Royal disbursements from the 1st
of October, 21st Henry VII. 1505, to the 20th November, 1st Henry VIII.
1509; another, from the 1st of May, 1st Henry VIII. 1510, to February
in the 9th Henry VIII. 1518; the third, entitled "The King's Books of
Payments beginning 1st April, 9th Henry VIII. 1518, to December in the
12th Henry VIII." 1520; and the fourth is called "A Book of Arrears of
the 14th Henry VIII." 1522-3.

The expences noticed in the following sheets extend from the 17th
November 21st Henry VIII. 1529, to the end of December 24th Henry VIII.
1532; and in the library of the Royal Society is the book of Quarterly
Payments from February in the 29th Henry VIII. 1538, to Midsummer, 33rd
Henry VIII. 1541. In the library of the British Museum is the Household
Book of a Citizen, or perhaps Clergyman, of London, from March 1594
to March 1595.[2] Lord Bagot possesses an interesting MS. of the
Household expences of Edward Stafford, Duke of Buckingham, which his
Lordship some time since offered to allow the Society of Antiquaries to
print, but, extraordinary as it may appear, the proposition _was not
accepted_: and doubtlessly many other documents of the same kind are
extant.

Of the MSS. which have been cited, only those in the Chapter House and
the one in the library of the Royal Society resemble that printed in
this volume; but neither of them is precisely like it, in its objects
or contents. The one in the library of the Royal Society consists
principally of quarterly payments of wages to servants and retainers,
and of sums paid pursuant to the warrant of the Lord Privy Seal: they
present the charges of Ambassadors, of other public officers, and of
posts and couriers, as well as those of various articles purchased or
prepared by the king's commands, a few extracts from which, of general
interest, will be found in a subsequent page; these afford, however,
but a very imperfect idea of the value of that MS. in illustration
of the history and manners of the time, though it does not appear to
have been once noticed from the year 1762, when it was referred to
by Walpole, to the present time! The MS. now printed, contains, on
the contrary, what may be termed Henry's personal expences, whether
arising from his purchases; from his "rewards" to those who brought
him presents; from his losses at dice, cards, bowls, and other games;
from his attachment to Anne Boleyn, or his favourite courtiers; or
from the wages and liveries of his servants, fools, jesters, and other
minions. The accounts in the other MSS. were paid quarterly, and rested
on the responsibility of the persons entrusted to keep them; these
were daily, and are attested at the end of each month by the signature
of the King himself. Notwithstanding that they differ in character,
they mutually confirm and illustrate each other; and if a judicious
compilation were made from the whole series which has been mentioned,
and which could be comprised in one, or at the most, two quarto
volumes, invaluable information would be given to the world on the most
interesting period of English History--the period marked by the revival
of all which benefits and adorns society, Science, Literature, and the
Fine Arts. The Accounts of the Citizen of London are remarkable for
the minuteness with which the expence of every article of food, from a
farthing's worth of fruit to several pounds' worth of meat, is stated;
and as evidence of the price of provisions and other articles, wine,
servants' wages, &c. at the time, it is extremely useful. In the margin
the names of the guests at dinner and supper on each day are recorded,
and it altogether exhibits a curious picture of the manners of the
Elizabethan age.

It must be at once obvious, that Manuscripts which throw light upon
British History, but which are not sufficiently popular to enable
a bookseller to print them, ought to be published by the Society
incorporated for the sole purpose of advancing "the study of Antiquity,
and the history of former times," and to which we are indebted for
two of the volumes which have been alluded to; but the zeal which
caused them to be edited has unfortunately long since evaporated. If
it be thought impossible for the Society of Antiquaries to publish
all the MSS. which have been enumerated, the most striking entries,
and a summary of the expences of different departments might, at
least, be extracted from them. The objection that few of its Fellows
would undertake the trouble of editing such works without some
pecuniary advantage, may be met by the remark, that it possesses two
paid Secretaries, who are alike distinguished for their literary
productions; or, if the duties of these officers be too severe to
admit of their doing so, by asking whether it would not be a far more
legitimate application of its funds to appoint persons to prepare such
MSS. for the press, and to remunerate them for their labours, than to
waste the Society's resources, by publishing useless articles, because
they are gratuitous contributions; and still more, by inquiring whether
the cost of producing such compilations, with illustrative notes,
would not confer infinitely more honor upon that body, and tend in a
greater degree to advance the objects for which it exists, than a heavy
expenditure on useless engravings?

The Manuscript of these sheets is imperfect both at the commencement
and end; in one or two places part of a leaf has been torn off, and in
another a folio has been abstracted, whilst the first page is in many
places illegible. Its contents and orthography are printed literally,
and the imperfections in the copy pointed out by stars: the few blanks
which will be found, also occur in the MS. The earliest notice of it
which has been discovered is in the Lansdown MS. 737, which contains
numerous extracts made from it by Peter le Neve, Norroy King of Arms,
from 1704 to 1729, who says he bought the original "of ---- Wynde,
Esq. _and sold it for_ the same price _to the Right Honorable Lord
Harley, son and heir of the Earl of Oxford_ ---- 1723;" and adds in
the margin, "It was the book of Sir Orlando Bridgeman, Knight, Lord
Keeper, and in the beginning is his hand-writing." The words printed
in italics have been almost obliterated, perhaps in consequence of Le
Neve's having afterwards retained the volume instead of selling it;
but perhaps because it was surreptitiously taken from Lord Oxford's
collection. The next notice which occurs of it, is in Walpole's
"Anecdotes of Painting," from which it appears that in 1762 it was in
the possession of Mrs. Bridgeman, of Hanover Square. The name might
suggest the idea that her husband was a descendant of Sir Orlando
Bridgeman, who purchased it in 1634, and hence that the book was
in her possession in consequence of that relationship; but this is
contradicted by the fact of its having passed from Sir Orlando's family
to Mr. Wynde and from him to Le Neve sometime after 1704, who in 1723
sold it to the Earl of Oxford, though in 1762 we find it belonged to
a Mrs. Bridgeman. After that year nothing more is known of it, than
that it was purchased about a twelvemonth since at the sale of an
Undertaker and Broker, of the name of Gomme. In the fly leaf at the
beginning is the following memorandum, which Le Neve says was written
by Sir Orlando Bridgeman:--"Accounts of H. EIGHT, and signed with his
own hande, I gott it by Chance this yeere, 1634." With the exceptions
just noticed, the MS. is in fine preservation. From Le Neve's extracts
the contents of the folio which is now wanting, have been recovered,
though not in the original words, and will be found at the end of this
volume; but all the other imperfections seem to have existed when in
his possession, for he takes no notice of the first folio; he expressly
says of pages 131, 132, 133, that the leaf was then torn; and the last
folio of the MS. was the same as at present.

Walpole conjectures that they were the accounts kept by "Sir Bryan
Tuke, the Treasurer of the Chambers," but it is much more likely
that they were those of Sir William Fitz-William, afterwards Earl of
Southampton, Treasurer of the Household: nothing positive, however, can
be said on the subject.

Such notes as are requisite to explain the items, or to describe the
individuals mentioned, are introduced into the Index, which contains
references to every person, place, and thing, recorded. The Editor is
sensible that many of his observations are imperfect, and not a few,
perhaps, erroneous: in one or two instances he has been obliged to
confess his inability to throw any light upon the subject, and he will
be much gratified if his readers do not consider that there is still
greater cause for a similar confession. Simple as many of the Notes
appear, the labour and research with which they have been attended,
were considerable; and to have partially failed when complete success
was almost impossible, would not, he trusts, be discreditable to a far
abler Antiquary. His friend Dr. Meyrick, for whose assistance in his
literary pursuits the Editor has frequently had cause to express his
gratitude, and James Heywood Markland, Esq. Director of the Society of
Antiquaries, have most kindly and liberally afforded him their aid; and
the information which these gentlemen have respectively contributed is
equal in interest and importance to what might be expected from their
reputation.

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.


On the 23rd of October, 1529, Henry the Eighth came to his manor
of Greenwich;[3] in the November following he went on board the
Treasurer's ship;[4] and about the 20th of the same month arrived at
York Place,[5] now called Whitehall, where he spent his Christmas.

Anno. 1530.--Early in February, 1530, his Majesty was at Hampton
Court,[6] and on the 16th at Battersea, but returned the same day to
York Place.[7] On the 21st he was again at Hampton Court,[8] and on
the 13th of March, the celebrated Hugh Latimer, afterwards Bishop of
Worcester, preached before him and was rewarded with a gratuity of
five pounds, from which time he cannot be traced by these Accounts,
until the 5th of April, when he was at More Park, in Hertfordshire;[9]
and towards the end of that month he was at Windsor.[10] Between
April and July, Henry seems to have resided either at York Place or
Hampton Court: about the middle of July he was evidently at Oking,[11]
or Ockham Park, in Surrey; on the 23rd at Guilford;[12] on the 29th
at Windsor;[13] and returned to Hampton Court between the 10th and
13th of August,[14] where he remained until the 16th, on  which day
he went to Easthampstead,[15] and on the 17th was at Asheridge, in
Buckinghamshire.[16] On the 21st he was at Ampthill,[17] where he
appears to have remained until about the 4th of September; on the
5th of that month he was at Hertford,[18] having in passing through
Hitchin on the preceding day, given forty shillings to the Friars
of that place.[19] His Majesty did not quit Hertford Park until the
8th or 9th, when he proceeded to Waltham, at which place we find him
on the 12th.[20] He seems to have been again at More Park on the
21st,[21] soon after which he returned to Hampton Court, where, it is
particularly stated, he was on the 14th of October.[22] He resided
chiefly at that palace, occasionally, however, going to York Place,[23]
and perhaps to Greenwich, until the death of Cardinal Wolsey, on the
29th November, in that year; when, Hall says "he removed from Hampton
Court to Greenwich, where he with Queen Katherine kept a solempne
Christmas; and on the twelfe night he satte in the halle in his
estate, where as were divers enterludes, riche maskes and disportes,
and after that a great banket."[24] "Certain it is, however, that
Henry did not leave Hampton Court until the 8th of December,[25] and
it is most probable that he did not go to Greenwich until about the
14th of that month,[26] though it is unquestionable that he was there
on the 19th."[27] The only evidence of the festivities[28] mentioned
 by Hall, are entries of money delivered to the Princess Mary and
Lady Margaret Douglas, the King's niece,[29] "to disport with all
this Christmas;"[30] the large sum of 2615_l._ 9_s._ 6-1/4_d._ paid
for plate, and jewellery, chiefly for the latter, between the 21st of
December, 1530, and the 6th of January, 1531; new year's gifts; and
money lost at play.

A^{o}. 1531.--After Christmas, according to Hall "The King came to
his Manor of Westminster which before was called Yorke Place;"[31]
and we find that on the 17th January, 1531, he is said to have been
there,[32] and where it seems he was on the 28th of that month;[33]
on the 7th and 27th of February;[34] and on the 9th of March.[35]
On the 20th, he appears to have amused himself with shooting at
Tothill,[36] near Bridewell; and on the 23rd he was clearly at his
palace of Bridewell.[37] The divorce then almost wholly occupied his
Majesty's mind, though the only entries which in any way refer to it,
are of books sent to him from different abbots and priors, and the
removal of boat loads of books from one palace to another.[38] Hall
takes no further notice of the king's residence until Whitsuntide,
namely, the 28th of May, after which, he informs us, "The Kyng and
the Queene removed [apparently from Greenwich] to Windsor, and there
continued tyll the xiiij daye of Julye, on which daye the Kyng removed
to Woodstocke, and left hire at Wyndsore, where she laye a whyle, and
after  removed to the More, and afterwarde to Esthamstede: and after
this, day, the Kyng and she never saw together."[39] It is evident
from these Accounts that Henry again amused himself with shooting at
Tothill, about the 29th March;[40] that he was at Greenwich on the
13th of April;[41] that he went from it by water on the same day to
York Place;[42] but he returned soon afterwards,[43] and was there on
the 28th of May,[44] whilst Hall's statement that he then proceeded
to Hampton Court is proved by several entries on the 10th, 11th, and
12th of June; especially by a payment of 14_s._ 8_d._ "to the watermen
for carying of the King's stuffe from Greenwich to Hampton Court,
eleven men for two days:"[45] on the 15th he is expressly said to have
been there,[46] and again on the 18th, 22nd, and 24th, when watermen
were paid for waiting "the day the King came from Westminster to
Putney,"[47] an entry which probably referred to their attendance a
short time before. On the 3rd of July, "Henry was at York Place,"[48]
and on the 9th at Windsor;[49] but so far from there being any
corroboration of Hall's assertion, that on the 14th of July, "the King
removed to Woodstock," it may be inferred that he was either at Windsor
or Hampton Court until the 28th,[50] with the exception of the 22nd,
when he was at Chertseye.[51] It is however unquestionable that he
commenced his progress towards the end of July; and the following seems
to  have been the itinerary of his journey. At Guilford on the 29th of
July,[52] at, or near, Farnham, in Surrey, on the 2nd of August;[53]
at Odiham on the 4th;[54] at the Vyne in Hampshire, the seat of Lord
Sandys, from the 4th to the 5th,[55] during which time he hunted in
Wolmer forest;[56] on the 8th he was at Easthampstead,[57] whence he
proceeded to Woodstock, where we find him on the 22nd,[58] and probably
also on the 13th.[59] His Majesty remained there until the 2nd or 3rd
of September,[60] and evidently enjoyed every diversion which the
country afforded him, namely, hunting, shooting, hawking, fishing, &c.
From Woodstock he went to Grafton in Northamptonshire, where he arrived
on the 5th,[61] when the Mayor of Northampton sent him a present of
pears,[62] and where it appears he gave an audience to the Hungarian
Ambassadors, for whom a house was hired at Stony Stratford.[63]
Henry continued at Grafton until about the 10th, when he went to
Ampthill,[64] in Bedfordshire, and purchased some silks and jewellery
on the 15th;[65] and on the 20th we find him at Waltham Abbey,[66]
where he was also on the 9th of October.[67] Hall informs us that about
this time the King caused a solemn obsequy to be kept at that place for
the Duchess of Angouleme, mother of the King of France, who died on the
22nd of September, at which ceremony he assisted, attended by many of
his nobles.[68] On the 23rd of that Month he healed a poor woman at
Havering Bower,[69] though he returned to Waltham before the 25th,[70]
and on or before the 31st he arrived at his palace of Greenwich,[71]
having previously fished at Hunsdon.[72]

It is uncertain how long Henry continued at Greenwich, but perhaps
a few weeks only; for we find the road near Peckham mended, in
expectation of his passing it, on the 23rd of November, on which day
the watermen were likewise paid for removing his "stuff" to Hampton
Court;[73] and on the 4th of December we positively learn that he
was at that place.[74] Hall says "the King kepte his Christemas at
Greenwyche with great solempnite, but all men sayde that there was
no myrthe in that Christemas because the Queene and the ladies were
absent;"[75] there is only one entry, namely of the sum of 56_l._
13_s._ 4_d._ given to the Earl of Angus, on the 15th of December,[76]
which tends to shew where Henry was at that time, and which agrees with
the Chronicler's statement.

Anno. 1532.--On the 16th of January, 1532, it seems his Majesty
was at York Place, and on the 18th, books were sent there to him
from the bookbinder;[77] and we find that plate and furniture were
conveyed there about the same time from Greenwich[78] He was still
at Westminster on the 5th[79] and 22nd of February,[80] and 8th of
March;[81] on the  18th of which month, according to Hall, he gave
an audience to the Speaker and Members of the House of Commons.[82]
No account of Henry's residence occurs after that date until the
8th of April, when Lady Sydney sent him a present of orange pies at
Greenwich,[83] and where he continued until the 16th. Early in April
"sodeynly began a pestylence in Westmynster,"[84] and the disease
evidently extended to Greenwich, for on the 11th of that month several
persons were sent out of that town "by reason of the plage."[85] On
the 16th of April his Majesty went to Westminster,[86] but returned
again to Greenwich before the 26th, upon which day a hawk was brought
to him at that palace.[87] He was, however, at Westminster on the
8th of May,[88] though it may be inferred that he was at Greenwich
on the 15th.[89] There can be little doubt that from the 8th of
April to the end of May he divided his time between those palaces,
for as the parliament was then sitting at Westminster, his presence
was occasionally indispensable; and we learn from Hall, that on the
16th of May, Sir Thomas More delivered the great seal to the King
at that place. On the 1st of June Henry was at Eltham,[90] where he
resided until the 3rd of July,[91] the entries during which period
are excessively curious, as indicative of the manner in which he
passed his time.[92] He arrived at Waltham on or before the 4th of
July,[93] and continued there, or at  Hunsdon until about the 21st,
when he commenced his summer progress into Berkshire, Bedfordshire,
Bucks, and Oxfordshire. On the 23rd of July he was at Ampthill,[94]
at which place he continued until the 28th or 29th,[95] when he
proceeded to Grafton; where, on the 31st, a monk brought him a letter
in a purse.[96] He quitted Grafton about the 5th of August, and on
the 6th was at Buckingham;[97] on the 10th, he was at Woodstock,[98]
where he ordered 56_l._ 13_s._ 4_d._ to be paid to Doctor Chambers
for the scholars of Oxford, on the 14th.[99] From Woodstock he went
to Langley Park, near Colnbrook, at which place a hundred crowns were
given to him to play at dice on the 18th;[100] and on the 25th he was
at Abingdon.[101] On the 27th he was both there and at Ewelme, the
distance between which does not exceed ten miles: at the former, Sir
Simon Harcourt's servant brought him a brace of greyhounds, and at the
latter an Italian presented him with a melon.[102] His Majesty appears
to have passed through Reading on the 28th,[103] and to have reached
Windsor on the 31st of August,[104] where he remained until the 17th of
September,[105] when he went to Chertsey;[106] but on the 21st he was
at Hampton Court.[107] No notice is to be found of Henry's having been
at Ampthill after the 28th of July; whence, Hall asserts, he proceeded
to Windsor, where he created Anne Boleyn, Marchioness  of Pembroke,
on the 1st of September in this year; after which he removed to
Greenwich.[108] It is manifest from these Accounts, that the King was
at Windsor on the 1st of September, but nothing occurs relative to that
ceremony: she is for the first time described in them as Marchioness
of Pembroke, on the 19th of that month. His stay at Hampton Court was
very short, for on the 28th he was at Greenwich.[109] The period had
now arrived which Henry had fixed upon for his interview with Francis,
the French monarch; and having visited his fleet at Sheppey on the
30th,[110] he set out for Dover early in October, and on the 6th was
at the Mote Park, near Maidstone.[111] Hall says that on the 10th
of October the King came to Dover, and very early in the morning of
Friday the 11th, embarked for Calais, where he arrived at ten o'clock
on the same day.[112] From these Accounts it is evident that Henry
went from the Mote to Sheppey by water, thence to Canterbury, where
he slept, and then proceeded to Dover. The payments mentioned "to
the waits of Canterbury;" to the "keeper of the house where the King
lodged" in that city; to the master of the barge and watermen for
rowing him to Sheppey;[113] as well the reward to a man who brought
bills to Dover,[114] occurred after his Majesty had quitted those
places; as the first three were paid on the 11th, and the fourth on the
day, when, from the next item, it is certain the King was at Calais,
namely, on the  12th; and which agrees with Hall's statement. The
proceedings of the royal party whilst in France; the particulars of the
interview between the Monarchs; and of the feastings on the occasion,
are minutely related by that Chronicler, but it is not necessary to
allude more fully to them, than to observe, that the Accounts about
that time are extremely interesting. Among the entries most worthy of
notice, are the present of grapes and pears from the Great Master of
France to Anne Boleyn; the money lost by the King to the Cardinal of
Lorrain, the Duke de Guise, and others, at tennis and dice at Boulogne,
and which amounted in one day to 163_l._ 6_s._ 8_d._; the purchase of a
hat and feather for Henry at that place; a gratuity to the singers of
the French monarch, and to those of the Cardinal of Lorrain; payment
of the doublets given to the guard to wrestle in before the two kings
at Calais; the sum of 700_l._ paid to Cromwell without any reason
being mentioned; the purchase of masking geer, or masquerade dresses;
the large sums paid for jewels, and which amounted during his stay
in France to 3592_l._ 12_s._; the charges of the fool's lodgings and
expenses; Henry's offering to the image of our lady of Boulogne, and
which is especially mentioned by Hall;[115] the presents of hawks from
Francis to Henry; the charges for boats for carrying the King from the
ship to the shore, and again from Calais to his vessel on his return,
&c. The whole amount paid by the person who kept these Accounts from
the time the  King left Dover until he again landed there, namely,
thirty-three days, was 4033_l._ 10_s._ 11_d._ Of that sum, as has just
been shewn, all excepting about a ninth, was for jewellery, great
part of which was evidently given as presents to persons in the King
of France's suite. According to Hall, Henry embarked at Calais on the
13th of November at midnight, and arrived at Dover at five in the
morning of the 14th,[116] which agrees with the entry on the 13th of a
payment of 4_s._ 8_d._ "for a boat to bring the King aboarde his ship
at Calys;"[117] and of the same sum "paied to the King's own hands for
his offering to our Lady in the Rock at Dover," on the 14th.[118] It is
certain that Henry remained at Dover until the 16th, when he went to
Sandwich, and seems to have rested there that night, to the friars of
which place he gave 3_l._ 10_s._ "by way of rewarde;"[119] and crossed
the river Stour on the next day[120] on his way to Canterbury, where he
apparently stopped at the house of Sir John Feneux.[121] The waits of
that city again played to the king, and were rewarded with 18_s._ 8_d._
on the 19th,[122] on which day his Majesty arrived at Sittingbourne;
and the "wife of the Lion," or in other words, the wife of the man
who kept the Lion Inn there, received a gratuity of 4_s._ 8_d._[123]
On the 20th, Henry was at Stone Castle, near Dartford, where it may
be inferred he remained that night, as 9_l._ 6_s._ 8_d._ was given
him, which he lost at play to Anne Boleyn, Sir Francis Bryan, and Sir
Francis Weston.[124]

Thence the King removed to Eltham at which place he was on the
24th,[125] and on the 28th he was at Greenwich, where he remained until
the 30th, on which day he went by water to Westminster.[126] On the
1st of December he was at the Tower of London,[127] but on the 9th his
Majesty was again at Greenwich[128] before the 18th of which month, he
had been twice in his barge to the Tower.[129] On the 21st he seems
to have gone to York Place,[130] but if so he returned the same day
to Greenwich,[131] where Hall says he spent his Christmas,[132] and
which is corroborated by the last entry in these Accounts; "Item the
same, [_i. e._ the last] day delivered to the King's grace at night at
Grenewich, ij c. corons, 46_l._ 13_s._ 4_d._" evidently for play.[133]
It would be superfluous to point out all which occurs relative to
Henry's progresses; but it must be observed that he was always attended
by a smith with locks and bolts for his chamber-doors;[134] that money
was given to a footman to be distributed in charity by the way;[135]
that in the hunting season his hounds were sent from one palace to
another, the expenses of removing which are minutely stated;[136]
that he was generally followed by his fools, jester, minions, and
other favourites;[137] and that the celebrated Anne Boleyn frequently
accompanied him.[138] Wherever he  went gratuities or rewards were
given to the keepers of the parks or forests through which he passed,
or hunted, not merely to those belonging to the Crown, but to the
keepers of the parks of private persons; and if he went on board one of
his ships, a sum was distributed amongst the crew.

Upon the personal character of Henry the Eighth, it has been remarked
in the preface, these Accounts throw much light; and as whatever
relates to the private conduct of eminent persons, is by far the most
pleasing, and perhaps most useful part of antiquarian inquiries, the
information here presented on that of Henry, is both valuable and
interesting.[139]

His Majesty's principal amusement was gambling in its most extensive
and diversified shapes, and all his relaxations from the duties of his
station in a greater or less degree partook of it. The philosopher will
be at no loss to account for the fact; for it is the frequent attendant
upon that satiety which unlimited power is sure to produce, though it
is often equally the passion of those who want even the necessaries of
life. That Henry, tired of more rational enjoyment, and incapable of
finding a permanent relief from the ennui of greatness, should have
indulged to excess in games of chance is not surprising; and to shew
the extent to which that passion was carried, it is sufficient to state
that the whole amount paid for his losses at cards, dice, tennis, and
other games,  together with those lost in wagers amounted in three
years to 3243_l._ 5_s._ 10_d._ It is not a little singular that though
passionately addicted to gambling himself he was sufficiently careful
of the morals of his subjects to issue a proclamation in the 18th year
of his reign, forbidding them to play at cards and bowls.

Of his "out-of-door" amusements, shooting at the rounds, hunting,
hawking, fishing, horse-racing, bowls, and tennis, were the chief;
and in his palaces many hours were daily passed at "the tables" or
back-gammon, shovel-board, dice, and cards: wagers on races run against
dogs, or at shooting or hunting; payments to people for making dogs
perform tricks; gratuities to persons for different feats, as eating a
buck, riding two horses at once; and others of a similar description
are continually mentioned. Music and literature also occasionally
lent their aids to his enjoyments; and that he encouraged the latter
is manifest from the exhibitions he founded at the Universities, his
occasional gratuities to scholars, and his support of boys at St.
Paul's, and other schools, both in this country and Paris. His love
of architecture is shewn by the money he expended in building, at his
different residences, and we find that he spent on York Place, from
April, 1530 to July, 1532, 2400_li._, besides 10_l._ 19_s._ 2_d._ for
glazing it, and 20_l._ 0_s._ 8-1/2_d._ for iron work, on the house
at More Park, 60_l._ in April, and 50_l._ in June, 1530; and on his
buildings at Hunsdon 1533_l._ 6_s._ 8_d._ between May, 1530, and
April, 1532; forming a total, exclusive of repairs and alterations,
of 4064_li._ 5_s._ 10_d._ within three years. Nor was he indifferent
to painting, as several entries occur of money given to painters for
their works; but as they have been commented upon by Horace Walpole in
his "Anecdotes of Painting," they afford no new information on that
interesting subject. That writer also gives several entries relative
to Hans Holbein from the "Book of Quarterly Payments" in the library
of the Royal Society; and as they are intimately connected with the
allusion here made to Henry's taste for the arts, accurate copies have
been made of them from that manuscript.

After the death of Jane Seymour, the King was not a little perplexed
in his choice of her successor: the Duchess Dowager of Milan was first
thought of, but she is said to have declined that honor, because nature
had not prepared her for it, by endowing her with two heads! Walpole
informs us, that the first of these entries refers to Holbein's having
been sent to paint her portrait in December, 1538:

December, A^{o}. 30 Henry VIII. 1538. "Item, Payde to Hans Holbyn, one
of the kingis paynters, by the kingis commaundement, certefyed by my
lord pryviseales lettre x_li._ for his costs and chargs at this tyme
sent abowte certeyn his gracs affares into the parties of High Burgony,
by way of his gracs rewarde, x_li._"

That the painter was abroad at Christmas, in that year, is evident from
the entries of payments then made to the royal establishment;

"Item, for Hans Holbyn, paynter, nihil."

A letter from Nicholas Wotton, who with the Richard Bearde there
mentioned, were deputed to negociate the marriage between Henry and Ann
of Cleves, illustrates the next entry; for it proves that "his Grace's
affairs" meant to paint the portrait of that lady, and of her sister,
Amelia. Wotton's letter, which has been printed by Mr. Ellis,[140] is
dated at Duren, the 11th of August, 1539: after describing Ann, he
says, "your Grace's servante, Hanze Albein, hath taken the effigies of
my Ladye Anne and the Lady Amelye, and hathe expressyd theyr imaiges
verye lyvelye."

July, 31 Henry VIII. A^{o}. 1539. "Item, to Mr. Richard Bearde, one of
the gromes of the kingis privichamber, and Hans Holbyn, paynter, by
like lettre sent into the parties of High Almayne, upon certain his
Gracis affaires for the costes and chardgis of them both, xl_li._; And
to Hans Holben for the prepairacion of such things as he is appoynted
to carie with him, xiij_li._ vj_s._ viij_d._, in all, the somme of
liij_li._ vj_s._ viij_d._"

The history of that portrait, which, however "lyvelye," was not
faithful, though such the ambassadors obviously meant to describe it,
has been told by Walpole and Granger, and is repeated by Mr. Ellis.

After that time several entries occur of the payment of Holbein's
quarterly wages, of some of which the annexed are copies:

"Item, to Hans Holbyn, vij_li._ x_s._"

In 1539 he was paid half a year's wages in advance;

"Item, payde to Hans Holbyn, the kyngis paynter, in advauncement of his
wages, for one half yere beforehand, the same half yere accompted and
reconnyd from Michaelmas last past, the somme of xv_li._"

At Michaelmas, 32 Hen. VIII. A^{o}. 1540, he is thus mentioned;

"Item, for Hans Holbyn, paynter, ii_li._ q^{r} [~p]us [p-] warr."

At Christmas, in that year;

"Item, for Hans Holbyn, paynter, ii_li._ q^{r} [~p]us manibus."

At Midsummer, 1541, after his name "nihil q^{r} [~p]us" occurs.

On another occasion his wages were also paid in advance;

"Item, Paide by the kyngis highnes commaundement certefied by my lorde
Pryviseales lettres to Hans Holbenne paynter, in the advauncement of
his hole yeres wagis before hande, aftre the rate of xxx_li._ by yere,
which yeres advauncement is to be accompted from this present Mich',
And shall ende ultimo Septembris next commynge, the somme of xxx_li._"

Among other curious entries in that MS. are, a new year's gift of
a skreen to Henry, from Luke Hornebaund, painter, who is mentioned
by Walpole, and whose wages were lv_s._ vj_d._ per quarter; and the
following:

The costs of the scaffold erected in Westminster Hall for the trial of
the persons involved in Anne Boleyn's fate.;

December 30, Hen. VIII. A^{o}. 1538, "Item, payde to Jamys Nedeham by
the kyngis commaundement certefyed by my lorde prvyseall for the costs
and chargs of the Scaffold made in the king[s] halle at West[^m] at
the condempnacion of the late malefactors and traytours there, the
some of xxviij_li._ xix_d._ ob. for the makinge and stuf of the saide
Scaffolde, as apperith by rekenyng therof made more at large doth
appere, xxviij_li._ xix_d._ ob."

January, 31 Hen. VIII. 1540, "To the Quenes pleyers for playing before
the kinge, iiij_li._;" also, "to the kingis pleyers for pleyng before
the king, vj_l._ xiij_s._ iiij_d._;" "to the princis pleyers for
playnge before the king, iiij_li._;" and a grant for life of 2_l._
2_s._ 4_d._ per annum to "Richard Parrowe, one of the King's interlude
players," in February, 1540.

The expences of preparing beds at Dartford and Rochester, for the king
and Anne of Cleves;

January, 31 Hen. VIII A^{o}. 1540.--"Item, to Edward Lloid yoman of the
Warderobe of Beddes and John Askowe grome of the same, for themself and
a Smythe that was with them to set up twoo bedds of the kingis, one at
Dertford and an other at Rochestre, and for making redy there for the
Quenes Grace, by the space of xxx days, the yoman at ij_s_ the dey, the
grome at xx_d._ and the Smythe at xij_d._ the day, as apperith by a
bill, signed with the Lorde Chamberlains hande, vij_li._"

In January, 32 Hen. VIII. A^{o}. 1541.--"To the Ducke of Suffolkis
pleyers for pleyinge in the kingis hawle on twelf even, the somme of
xx_s._;" and we learn from another entry that the names of three of the
King's players were Robert Histow, George Birche, and Richard Parrowe,
and that the quarterly wages of the three were 1_l._ 13_s._ 4_d._

Henry's fondness for jewellery was profusely gratified; and in the
period embraced by these accounts the enormous sum of 10,801_l._
8_s._ 9_d._ was expended in precious stones, gold chains, &c. besides
1517_li._ to his goldsmith for plate. A considerable share of his
attention was, it is well known, directed to his navy, and the few
entries relating to it are of much interest. Horses or geldings,
particularly racing horses, and horses "that did run," as well as
"riding boys," clothes bought for the boys "that ride the running
horses," and riding caps for them, are constantly spoken of; and dogs
for the chace were a frequent, and doubtlessly, acceptable present. At
the christenings of the children of some of the chief noblemen, and of
those of his favourites, Henry was sometimes a sponsor; and the sums
paid to the nurse and midwife on such occasions are carefully noticed.
The inferior attendants of the Court, as huntsmen, falconers, and
those of the king's guard, received small presents on their marriages,
which varied from two to five pounds, according to their situations,
or the degree of favor which they enjoyed: on the marriage of the son
of "Master Nevill", however, the king gave him ten pounds. Gifts to
minstrels, to the astronomer, to physicians, to the keepers of the
clocks at the different palaces, to posts and servants for bringing
letters, to copyists, to the master of his barge, and the keepers of
his Majesty's dogs, bears, hawks, &c. are very numerous. His fools,
jester, and minions are prominent characters in these Accounts, and the
information afforded respecting them tends to illustrate the manners of
the age.

Although it would be preposterous to follow a recent example of
attempting to remove the stains on Henry the Eighth's character--stains
which throw all common crimes into the shade--it would be no less
absurd to deny him the common merit of having a few redeeming traits
in his disposition. Besides the instances which have been alluded
to of his taste for architecture, music, painting, and literature,
we frequently find payments which must have originated in the best
feelings of the human heart; and of which it will be sufficient to
cite, gifts "to an old poor man by the king's charitable alms that
laboured to obtain a bill to be signed;" to a footman, "to relieve him
in his sickness;" to a French fletcher, "towards his surgery;" to the
almoner, "for two sick men at Waltham;" to a "sick priest at Hampton
Court;" to "a poor man that had thirteen children, for their relief;"
to "little Guilliam, in way of reward, because he was sick in London;"
to "three sick women at Greenwich;" to "a poor woman in Chertsey, to
purchase out the great seal;" to "a blind woman, being a harper;" "to
a poor woman for to redeem her husband out of prison;" to "a poor
woman, to obtain her husbands freedom, and hers in London;" to "a
frantick man;" to "Great William, for his surgery, when he was sick at
London," &c. These could only have emanated from momentary emotions of
benevolence; and they prove that, like even greater monsters, Henry's
heart was not entirely shut to the wants and sufferings of his fellow
creatures. It is true that pity was a stranger to his breast when
either his pride, or safety, or lust, or revenge was in question; but
he was undoubtedly compassionate upon less selfish occasions.

Independently of gifts in charity, and to persons supposed to be
healed by the King's touching them, payments of 10_l._ per month were
regularly made to Dr. Baugh for his Majesty's private alms. Henry's
principal associates, besides his fool, jester, Thomas Smith, Mark
Smeton, the two Williamses, Domingo, and one or two other minions,
all of whom appear to have been wholly supported and clothed at his
expence, were his favorites, Sir Francis Bryan, Sir Henry Norris, Lord
Rochford, Sir Francis Weston, Sir Edward Seymour, the Serjeant of the
Cellar, and a few others; and on perusing the evidence here afforded
of the favor which they enjoyed, and the intimacy to which they were
admitted, the mind is impressed with horror at the reflection of how
few of them escaped falling victims to his suspicion, jealousy, or
revenge. But when the partners of his bed and throne met a similar
fate, it would have been a subject of surprise had the companions of
his hours of revelry and enjoyment, or the sharers of his sports and
amusements been spared. Of Anne Boleyn and her family, numerous curious
particulars will be found, many of which tend to show the manner in
which she was treated at court from November, 1529, until her elevation
to the throne; and as every thing which relates to her is of great
interest, the following abstract of them may be acceptable.

The precise time when Henry's attachment to her commenced is uncertain,
but three years before her marriage, the Master of the Robes paid for
some purple velvet for her; and on the 28th, for stuff prepared for her
use. In December following, 180_l._ were given to her by the King's
order: in April, 1530, her servant was paid for finding a hare;[141]
and in May, the taylor and skinner were paid for her dresses; and bows,
arrows, and other articles for shooting were bought for her.[142] The
large share of the king's affection which she then possessed, and which
was perhaps deemed to be the harbinger of her subsequent honors, is
evident from the fact of the Mayor of London having sent her a present
of cherries on the 5th of June; and the servant who brought them  was
rewarded with 6_s._ out of the privy purse. More bows were purchased
for her on the 10th of that month; and in an entry in July as well as
in the December preceding a person called George Taylor, is expressly
styled, "my Lady Anne's servant." Linen cloth for her was paid for in
September, in which month ten shillings were given for a cow that one
of her greyhounds had killed. A remarkable entry occurs in November, in
that year, from which it appears that Anne Boleyn had pawned one of her
jewels to her sister Mary, and that Henry ordered 20_l._ to be given to
redeem it; a few days afterwards, about twenty yards of crimson satin
were purchased for her use. In December, eight guineas were given for
budge skins or furs for her; on the 21st of that month she received
twenty shillings in silver: the next day linen cloth for her shirts was
paid for, and she was repaid 5_l._, which she had given to Henry Webb
by the King's command. On the 23rd, the same sum was given to her for
playing money, in groats, and on the 30th, Henry gave her 100_l._ as a
New Years' gift. In February, 1531, her mercer's bill was again paid,
and on the 17th, her servant Taylor, received 11_l._ 6_s._ 8_d._ to be
"employed about my Lady Anne Rochford's business;" before the end of
which month a farm was purchased for her at Greenwich, and for which
86_l._ 13_s._ 4_d._ were given. Her desk was garnished with laten and
gold in April following; when her embroiderer was paid for work done
for her. Early in May, 40_l._ were given her "to play;" on the 22nd,
having lost 12_l._ 7_s._ 6_d._ at bowls to the Sergeant of the Cellar,
that sum was paid to him out of the Privy Purse by his Majesty's
commands; and on the 10th, eight yards of crimson cloth of gold were
bought for her. From that time nothing more is said of Anne Boleyn
until December, when her taylor's bill amounting to 28_l._ 6_s._ 4_d._
for her clothes was discharged; shortly after which her skinner's bill
of 40_l._ 15_s._ 8_d._ was likewise paid. On the 29th of May, 1532, the
King's watermen were remunerated for conveying her to Durham House. In
June a splendid cloak and night-gown were purchased, and the price of
all the materials, is detailed with the minuteness of a milliner's bill
of the present day, from which it seems that both were made of black
satin; that the former was edged, and the latter lined with velvet of
the same colour; and that the cloak cost altogether 9_l._ 4_s._ 8_d._;
whilst the night-gown was lined with black taffeta, and cost 10_l._
15_s._ 8_d._: at the same time sixteen yards of green damask were also
purchased for her.

In August in this year, her future elevation became so certain that
the wife of one of the most distinguished courtiers of the time, in
imitation of the example set nearly two years before by the Mayor of
London, endeavoured to propitiate her favour by a present; as on the
17th of that month, Lady Russell, afterwards Countess of Bedford sent
her a stag and a greyhound, which she gave to the King, who ordered
40_s._ to be paid to the servant who brought them. On the 1st of
September, Anne Boleyn was created Marchioness of Pembroke, and on the
19th of that month, the Master of the Robes was paid for stuff which
was delivered to her servant, probably for the costume in which she
appeared at the ceremony; and about a fortnight afterwards certain
silks were provided by him for her apparel, the costs of which were
56_l._ She accompanied Henry to Calais in October, 1532; and her
reception by Francis the First as well as the prominent part which
she performed in the festivities that attended the interview between
the two Monarchs, are fully described by Hall. From these Accounts we
learn that the Great Master sent her a present of grapes and pears at
Calais on the 14th of October; that on the 11th of November, fifteen
shillings were paid to her which she had won of Henry at cards at that
place; that on the 20th a few days after her return from France, she,
Sir Francis Bryan and Sir Francis Weston, formed a party with the King
at Pope Julius' game at Stone Castle in Kent; and again on the 25th,
26th and 31st at Greenwich, on which occasions his Majesty was as usual
unsuccessful; that on the 28th she won 11_l._ 13_s._ 4_d._ of Henry
at Cards; and on the 25th of December more stuff was bought for her
clothes. It is to be observed, that according to some authorities,
Anne Boleyn was privately married to Henry, early in November, 1532,
immediately after their arrival at Dover from Calais; but nothing is to
be found in these accounts either corroborative of, or contradictory
to, the assertion. During the three years the whole sum expended for
her clothes, &c. was 468_l._ 6_s._ 1_d._, and within the same time she
received in money 218_l._ These sums are not, it is true, remarkable
for their amount, but they are sufficient to shew the manner in which
she was treated by Henry, and the place which she occupied in his
affections. Before concluding these observations relative to this
celebrated woman, the singular manner in which her sister and herself
are described must be pointed out. Until December, 1530, she is merely
spoken of as "my Lady Anne," but from February to May, 1531, with one
exception, she is called "Lady Ann Rochford," though from that time
until her creation to the Marquisate of Pembroke, she is again styled
"Lady Ann," after which event she is mentioned either as "my Lady
Marquess," or "my Lady Marquess of Pembroke." Her sister Mary too,
though married, is called Lady Mary Rochford. Rochford was the title of
their father when elevated to the Earldom of Wiltshire, and was then
borne by their brother George, who having become involved in his royal
sister's supposed crime, died, like her, upon a scaffold.

Before these proofs of the esteem in which Anne Boleyn was held by
Henry are contrasted with her subsequent fate, it is impossible to
avoid reflecting on the little regard which was then paid to the
virtuous Katherine. That her name should be but twice mentioned speaks
volumes on her secluded situation; and whilst all that wealth and power
could command were lavished on the new favourite, the magnanimous wife
was equally neglected by her husband, his satellites, and the world.
Remorse seems, however, at length to have touched Henry's heart, for
a few years after her death, namely, in November, 1539, the following
entry occurs in the "Book of Quarterly Payments," in the Library of the
Royal Society.

"Item, to Mrs. Blanch Twyford, by the Lord Privy Seal's letter, for her
long and painful service done unto the Princess Dowager, by way of the
King's reward--66_l._ 13_s._ 4_d._"

Mrs. Twyford was bequeathed 10_l._ by Katherine's will.

The Princess, afterwards Queen, Mary, is frequently noticed, but
all which we learn is, that she was ill in June or July, 1531, and
apparently again in March, 1532; and that from 10_l._ to 20_l._ were
occasionally given to her for pocket-money, or to be distributed in
charity. The Duke of Richmond, Henry's natural son, is also spoken of;
as well as his niece, the Lady Margaret Douglas, daughter of the Earl
of Angus, but she is here called Lady Margaret Anguishe.

A few entries are strongly indicative of the superstition of the age;
the most striking of which are the King's offerings to the images of
our Lady at Calais, Boulogne, Dover, Walsingham and of the Pue; and of
persons being "touched for the evil," to whom 22_l._ 2_s._ 6_d._ were
paid in three years, each having received 7_s._ 6_d._, and which proves
the number "touched" in that period to have been fifty-nine. They came
wherever his Majesty was, whether in town, or on his progresses, and
even at Calais.

A few entries require to be separately noticed, as well as being
referred to in the index; namely, the PRESENTS brought to the King,
the PRICES OF LABOUR, SERVANTS' WAGES and LIVERIES, the VALUE OF LAND,
HOUSE RENT, and the different kinds of MONEY which are mentioned.

Upon the presents brought, few remarks are required, for it will at
once be seen that they chiefly consisted of articles of food of every
description, including fish, poultry, game, baked lampreys, swans,
pies, fruit, meat, puddings, brawn, cranes, birds; of dogs, horses,
foxes, hawks, deer, mules, wild boars, and on one occasion, a lion; of
fishing-rods, whistles, wood-knives, &c. and indeed whatever was then
in common use.

Nor were these offerings sent only by the higher classes of society;
even the poorest of Henry's subjects presented him with something which
they fancied would be acceptable to his palate. The bringer uniformly
received a gratuity "in reward" proportionate to the value of the gift;
thus, the German who brought a lion was paid 6_l._ 13_s._ 4_d._; he who
brought a stag, 20_s._; Lady Sidney's servant for bringing quince pies,
6_s._ 8_d._; and Dyrick's wife of Greenwich received the same sum for
a capon and chickens. Similar gratuities were given to the gardeners
of the king's different seats for bringing fruit and herbs; and as
no gift was too contemptible to be accepted, the money thus paid "in
reward" sometimes exceeded the value of the donation. In most cases
these offerings were doubtlessly tendered as testimonies of respect,
but in many the "reward" was, perhaps, the real motive. As the index
contains a reference to every thing presented to Henry, it is needless
to enlarge on the subject.

Of the PRICE OF LABOUR the best evidence, besides the wages of
servants, which will be more particularly noticed, are the sums paid
for different articles purchased. We learn, also, that two men in July,
1530, were paid 13_s._ 4_d._. for ten days' work in mowing, _i. e._,
8_d._ a-day each. In February, 1532, the hire of seven horses, and the
expences of the same number of men for sixteen days, sent into Wales,
and other places, at 1_s._ 8_d._ per day for each man, amounted to
9_l._ 6_s._ 8_d._, and in July in the same year 1_l._ was paid for the
hire of ten men for three days, in drawing the fishponds at Ampthill,
at 8_d._ a day each.

The WAGES OF SERVANTS differed of course according to their situations;
those of a Falconer were generally a groat a day, and he was allowed
one penny a day for the food of each hawk intrusted to his care; but
those of Nicholas Clamp, one of the principal falconers, were 10_l._
per annum. A Huntsman received 35_s._ 5_d._ a quarter, and as well as
most of the other servants, he had 4_d._ per day for his board wages.
The allowance for the board of the boys of the stable was 1_s._ 8_d._
per week each; and of the boys that "run the King's geldings," or as
they are sometimes called, "the King's riding boys," 2_s._ a week each,
whilst on one occasion we find six days' meals for them paid for at the
rate for each of them five pence a day. The keeper of the Barbary horse
was allowed 1_s._ 8_d._ per week for his board, his wages being 4_l._
a year; the Hen-taker was however better paid, as he received 45_s._
7_d._ a quarter. The regular wages of the King's watermen were 10_s._
a quarter; but it would appear that they were paid extra upon every
occasion when they were employed. Sexton the Fool's, servant's wages,
were 15_s._ a quarter. The gardeners of York Place and of Beaulie, or
New Hall, in Suffolk, received about 12_l._ per annum; the gardener
of Greenwich 20_l._ a year; and the gardeners of Windsor and Wanstead
4_1._ a year.

Of the VALUE OF LAND, only one entry affords positive information. It
relates to land bought to enlarge the little Park of Windsor, for which
purpose 4_l._ were paid for two acres of meadow; but some idea may be
formed on the subject from the following items: a farm at Greenwich,
purchased for Anne Boleyn in February, 1531, cost 66_l._ 13_s._ 4_d._
but unfortunately we have no idea of its extent; in November, 1530,
fourteen loads of Hay, and six loads of Oats cost, with the carriage to
Greenwich Park, probably from the immediate neighbourhood, 6_l._ 2_s._
8_d._; and in January, 1532, is an entry of 7_l._ 4_s._ 4_d._ for the
same quantity of hay at 5_s._ 6_d._ the load, and of six loads of oats
at 9_s._ the load, including the carriage to the same place: hence we
find that the carriage cost 13_s._ 4_d._; but in May following oats
were 6_s._ 6_d._ the load.

Of the RENT OF HOUSES we have the subjoined particulars; that of a
House for the Henchmen, or to use the words of the MS. "of the house
where the Henchmen lie," was 2_l._ per annum, whilst that "of the one
hired for Lord Rochford at Greenwich was 10_l._ a year." When some
ambassadors proposed going to Waltham, a house was hired for them, and
the owner was paid 20_s._; and it appears from "the Book of Quarterly
Payments" before mentioned, that "the rent of a house in London for the
standing of the great standards with the rich coats of the guards for
half a year" was 17_s._ 4_d._

LIVERIES. Independently of the falconers, huntsmen, watermen, and
other servants, the King's painters regularly received liveries, the
cost of which was generally 22_s._ 6_d._: this sum included 2_s._, the
allowance for the badges which were affixed to them; but we find Patch
the Fool's man, allowed 23_s._ 4_d._ for his livery coat, and to others
26_s._ 8_d._ were sometimes given for that purpose.

  Total amount accounted for,  53,488   5   4-3/4

Besides pounds, shillings, pence, &c. the following coins are
frequently mentioned, an account of the value of which between 1529 and
1532, may be acceptable:--

ANGELS.[150]--A gold coin of the value of 7_s._ 6_d._

ANGELLOTS,[151] or ANGELET, is described to have been a half-angel,
current for 3_s._ 9_d._; but in the only place where it is mentioned in
these Accounts, it must have been inserted by a mistake of the writer
for _Angel_, as eighteen Angellotes are said to have amounted to 6_li._
15_s._ i.e. 7_s._ 6_d._ each.

CROWNS.[152]--A silver coin generally worth 5_s._; but all the entries
in which it is mentioned prove that its value was then but 4_s._ 8_d._

CROWNS OF THE ROSE.[153]--Gold pieces coined by Henry the Eighth in
1526: they were current for 4_s._ 6_d._

CROWNS OF THE SUN.[154]--French gold coins, so called from the Mint
mark. They were current in this country for 4_s._ 6_d._

RIALS, OR ROYALS.[155]--A gold coin then worth 11_s._ 3_d._ a half and
quarter real or royal were of proportionate value.

SOVEREIGNS.[156]--A gold coin of the value of 22_s._ 6_d._ from 1518 to
1534; after which they were current for 20_s._ The only entry in which
they are mentioned is of a person having in 1531 borrowed 11_li._ 5_s._
in "Souferayns," _i. e._ ten sovereigns, for the King.

the Index, it has not been thought necessary to repeat the references
to them.

[140] _Original Letters_, First Series, vol. i. p. 121.

[141] See "Addenda."

[142] Cardinal du Bellai, in a letter to the Grand Master of France,
the Duke de Montmorency, in 1532, says "Sometimes Madame Anne joins
our party, each equipt with the bows and arrows, as is, you know, the
English style in hunting." "The Lady Anne presented me with a complete
hunting suit, including a hat, a bow and arrow, and a greyhound."

[143] Of this sum, which is so much greater than the usual monthly
disbursements, 1743_l._ 8_s._ were for the expences of an embassy
to the Emperor; 1340_l._ 7_s._ 6_d._ for the King's losses at play;
100_l._ paid into his own hands; 200_l._ advanced to one of his
Majesty's servants for Henry's use, and 100_l._ for the wages of the
crews of two of his ships.

[144] This sum included 4400_l._ paid to Sir Bryan Tuke, evidently for
public affairs; probably embassies.

[145] This includes 1333_l._ 6_s._ 8_d._ for the payment of the
"retinue" or garrison of Calais; 2490_l._ 1_s._ 4_d._ expended in
jewels; and 100_l._ as a new year's gift to Anne Boleyn.

[146] Including 1886_l._ 15_s._ 4_d._ for jewellery and plate, and
833_l._ for other articles to a merchant stranger, and for cloth of
gold.

[147] The cause of this sum being so disproportionate to either of the
others may be explained by there being included in it 2000_l._ lent to
the Cofferer of the Household until Michaelmas next following; 2000_l._
placed in the hands of Thomas Alvard "to be by him safely kept for his
Graces's use and behoof;" hence 4000_l._ of it cannot be considered to
have been spent, a remark which also applies to a few other entries;
and 2000_l._ for the King's buildings at Westminster.

[148] In this month Henry's interview with Francis the First, at
Calais, occurred, and which accounts for the increased expenditure.

[149] Of this sum 3587_l._ 17_s._ 8_d._ were paid for jewellery.

      journey, 265.

    Upon the large sums expended in charity, some remarks will be found
    at the commencement of the volume.

  Almayne, to an, _i.e._ to a German, 117, 193.

  Almayne, to a gentleman of, 178.

  Alvard Thomas, 96, 116, 199, 228, 231.

    This appears to be the same person who is sometimes called
    Thomas Alford. See _Alford_. He is supposed by Mr. Ellis to have
    been keeper of Cardinal Wolsey's wardrobe, and which opinion is
    confirmed by the entry in p. 116. A very interesting letter from
    him to Cromwell in 1529, detailing the particulars of the last
    interview between Wolsey and the king, has been printed by Mr.
    Ellis, and also by Mr. Singer. If the conjecture be correct that he
    was the individual who is noticed in other parts of the book by the
    name of Alvord and Alford, it is manifest that after the Cardinal's
    decease he held an office of trust under the king.

  Amadas Master Robert, 97, 104, _bis_, 188.

    Apparently a jeweller.

  Ambassador, the Pope's, 9.

  Ambassador, to a doctor, being nephew to the bishop, who was
      ambassador here, 49.

    From the manner in which this payment is mentioned it may be
    inferred that it was a gratuity to the individual, in consequence
    of his relationship to the ambassador.

  Ambassadors, paid for the rent of a house intended for them, 74.

    The king being then, September 25, 1530, at Waltham Abbey, a house
    was engaged for the use of some ambassadors who were to have had an
    audience there, but they evidently did not occupy it.

  Ambassadors, to servants of, 104, 106, 135.

  Ambassador of France, 106.

  Ambassadors of Hungary, for the expenses of the, 160.

    The only embassy from Hungary noticed by Hall was in March 1527,
    when the Count of Ottonbrough, John Burgrave, and others had an
    audience of the King at Greenwich. After which, that Chronicler
    says, "they were well cherished and diverse tymes resorted to the
    courte and had greate chere and good rewardes, and so the 3rd. of
    Maie next ensuying they toke their leave and departed homeward."
    If this entry related to them, it is evident that they were on one
    occasion received by Henry at Grafton.

  Ambassador, money paid to the Scotch, 250.

    Like the gratuity to the relation of the ambassador, in p. 49, this
    appears to have been a present.

  Ambreys, eight cupboards, some with _Ambreys_ and some without, 93.

    "A cuppborde of waynscote with _ambries_."--_Harl. MSS._ 1419, f.
    55. This word is supposed to have meant originally, a little purse
    wherein money was put for the poor, and at length was used for any
    hutch or close place to keep meat left after meals; a cupboard for
    keeping cold victuals.--_Todd's Johnson._ It is evident however
    from the manner in which the word is here used that it was part of
    a cupboard rather than the cupboard itself, though it might have
    been appropriated, as a sort of safe, for the keeping of cold meat.
    Mr. Markland suggests that in the present instance "_ambreys_ meant
    cupboards within cupboards, or places of more secure concealment."

  Ambrose, a painter, 221. See "Painter."

  Ampthill. See Antill.

  Amsham Richard, 70.

    Apparently a draper.

  Anchor for an, for the king's boat, 262.

    The small sum paid for an anchor, a cable, and a sail, five
    shillings, is worthy of attention as shewing the value of such
    articles at the period.

  Andrew, the Italian friar to, 117, 128.

  Angell John, the jeweller, 139.

  Angling rods given to the king, 65, 240.

    The proof which these entries afford that Henry the Eighth was
    an angler, must interest the disciples of Isaac Walton. But
    Henry was not the only English monarch who was attached to the
    pursuit, Charles the Second, as well as his present Majesty having
    frequently sought relief from the cares of state in that tranquil
    amusement.

  Anguisshe Lady Margaret, 98, 183, 281.

  ---- Earl of, 180, 247.

    Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus, in Scotland, who, in 1514,
    married Margaret queen dowager of Scotland and sister of Henry the
    Eighth, from whom he was divorced before 1526. Angus had fled into
    England and placed himself under the protection of Henry, who, in
    1532, settled an annuity of 1000 marks upon him; and he remained
    in England until the death of James, King of Scotland. The Earl
    died in 1556. Lady Margaret Angus was evidently the issue of that
    marriage, and consequently the king's niece. She was at the time,
    when some pocket money was given her, little more than fifteen
    years old. This distinguished woman was the mother of Henry Lord
    Darnley, father of King James the First, and progenitrix of every
    subsequent monarch of this country.

  Annys or Ans Vincent, a jeweller, 218, 220.

  Anservis, a friar at Guildford, 63.

  Ansham, 220.

  Ansley Bryan, 103.

    Apparently a tradesman.

  Ansley Anthony, 134, 183, 193, 283.

    All the entries in which this person's name occurs relate to the
    expences of playing at tennis, hence it may be inferred that he was
    the keeper of the ground; or perhaps the marker.

  Anthony Anthony, 161, 179.

    A person of these names was Master of the Ordnance to Henry the
    Eighth, and made the celebrated drawing of the "Henry Grace de
    Dieu."--_See a note to Archaeologia, vol._ vi.

  Anthony Mark, 109, 157, 165.

    Apparently a Venetian merchant.

  Anthony a Sackbut, 174.

  Anticks, for two brought to the king, 226.

    Two buffoons, or two grotesque figures, might be meant by this
    entry, for Shakspeare seems to use the word in both senses,
    "We can contain ourselves were he the veriest _antick_ in the
    world."--_Induction, Taming the Shrew._ "Indeed three such _antics_
    do not amount to a man."--_Hen. V. act_ iii. _sc._ 2. Dr. Meyrick,
    however, with more probability, suggests that it referred to "two
    antiques," the taste "for articles of that description being then
    at its height in England, as it had been previously in Italy, on
    the revival of the arts." In old inventories, "one _antick_ head
    piece," "one _antick_ armour," often occur. Milton also, says,

    "_Antick_ pillars massy proof."

                                                         _Il Penseroso._

  Antill 68, _bis_, 69, _saepe_, 70, _saepe_, 161, 163, _bis_, 167, 168,
      236, 237, 238, 248.

  ----, keeper of the parks at, 70, 162, 163, 238.

    Ampthill, in the hundred of Redbornstoke, in Bedfordshire. In
    1441, William Beauchamp, Lord St. Amand, possessed it in right of
    his wife, and sold it to Sir John Cornwall Lord Fanhope, one of
    the heroes of Agincourt, and who, according to "Leland, builded
    the castelle of Antehill of such spoils as it is said he won in
    France." In 1453 Henry Duke of Exeter, son of Fanhope's wife, by
    her first husband, entered into a bond of 6000 marks to abide by
    the arbitration of Sir Thomas Bourchier respecting the manor of
    Ampthill and some other estates. In 1524, Roger de Grey Earl of
    Kent, alienated it to the Crown. It was made an honor by act of
    Parliament, the preamble to which states, that it was Henry the
    Eighth's intention "to erect, build, and edifie upon his grace's
    manor of Ampthill, sumptuous, stately, beautiful, and princely
    buildings." Ampthill has derived a mournful interest from its
    having been the residence of the unhappy Katherine, during the
    early part of the proceedings relative to her divorce, and she
    was cited from thence to attend the Commissioners at Dunstable.
    Henry was evidently at Ampthill in August 1530, September 1531,
    and July 1532. Mr. Lysons, says, no account of the manor is to be
    found during several subsequent reigns. The palace was allowed
    to go to decay. James the First bestowed the honor on the Earl
    of Kelly, but it soon reverted to the Crown. The custody of the
    Great Park was granted to Lord Bruce in 1613, and his descendants
    became lessees of it, in whom it continued until 1738, when the
    lease was purchased by the Duke of Bedford, and it was exchanged
    in 1800 to the late Earl of Upper Ossory. In the 17th century a
    family of Nicholls were lessees of Ampthill Great Park, and after
    the Restoration it was given by Charles the Second to Mr. John
    Ashburnham. In 1720, his descendants sold it to Lord Fitz-William,
    from whom it was purchased, in 1736, by Lady Gowran, grandmother
    of its late owner, the Earl of Upper Ossory, who died in 1818.
    That nobleman erected a column, in 1770, on the scite of Ampthill
    castle, upon which are inscribed the following beautiful lines by
    Horace Walpole.

    "In days of yore here Ampthill's towers were seen,
    The mournful refuge of an injur'd queen;
    Here flow'd her pure but unavailing tears,
    Here blinded zeal sustain'd her sinking years;
    Yet freedom hence her radiant banners wav'd,
    And love aveng'd a realm by priests enslav'd.
    From Katherine's wrongs a nation's bliss was spread,
    And Luther's light from Henry's lawless bed."

                                                 _Lysons' Bedfordshire._

  Apothecary, Sergeant, to the, 79, 146.

    One of these entries is curious, as the Sergeant Apothecary appears
    to have brought some gloves to the king. They were probably
    _perfumed_ gloves.

  ----, Culberd or Cutberd, the king's, his bills paid, 44, 124, 165,
      203, 251.

      282, 283.

  Apples, Quene brought, 163.

  Armacan, Bishop of, 104.

    The Bishop of Armagh, in Ireland, which See was then filled by John
    Kite, who resigned it in 1531.

  Armerer, William the king's footman's wife, 17, 78, 84, _bis_, 104,
      122, 197, _bis_, 217.

  Armeston Clement, 112.

  Armourer at Windsor, to the, 155.

  Armourer to the, 44, 184, 194, 196, 234.

  ----, paid the, for garnishing books, 214.

    The word garnish is used very indefinitely; it here seems to have
    meant placing clasps on books.

  Armoury at Windsor, the keeper of the, 41.

  Armoury, to two persons of the, 259.

  Arms the King's, to Henry Maynering for making the, 166.

    From the charge 8_l._ 19_s._ as well as from the word "making," it
    would seem that the royal arms were in this instance carved.

  Arnolde Henry, the shoe-maker, 219, 281.

  Arras for, 59, 215.

  Arrows for, 40, 47, 265.

  ----, paid for shooting, 50.

  Arrow head's given the King, 216.

  Arthur the luter, 131.

  Artichokes brought, 72, 77, 117, 142, 163, 169, 218, 220, 224, 232.

  Arundel Earl of, 146.

    William Fitz Alan, K.G., who succeeded to that dignity in 1524, and
    died in 1543.

  Arundell Master, 60.

    Probably Sir John Arundel, ancestor of the present Lord Arundel of
    Wardour. He was made a Knight of the Bath in 1495, and a Knight
    Banneret at Tournay, and died in 1545.

  Ashrigge, 67, _bis_.

  Assheley Hector, keeper of Hounsdon, 42, 60, 73, 81, 111, 136, 161,
      174, 211.

    All the payments to this individual were for the buildings at
    Hounsdon, which will be more particularly alluded to.

  Asshley Thomas, 215.

    Servant to Lady Ann Rochford.

  Astell Edmond, keeper of Greenwich Park, 205, 213, _bis_, 217.

    These payments relate to Greenwich Park, or for the food of the
    deer in it.

  Aston Master, 244.

  Astronomer, to Nicholas the, for mending a clock, 130.

  Atkins Richard, 36.

  Attorney to the King's, 135.

    The Attorney General in May, 1531, was Christopher Hales, but it is
    not certain that the payment was to that officer.

  Audley Lord, 65.

    John Tuchet, who was restored to that dignity in 1512, and died
    _ante_ 1558.

  ---- ----, his son's child christened, 145.

    John Tuchet, Lord Audley, above mentioned, had issue, three sons,
    George, Edward, and Richard. George succeeded to the dignity in
    1558, and had a son Henry, who also became Lord Audley, and it was
    probably that Henry who was christened in May 1531, and which would
    fix the date of his birth to that year, a point which has not been
    ascertained. Richard, the 3rd son of Lord Audley, also had issue,
    to one of whom this entry might relate, but the former is most
    likely. The state of the pedigree of that family is however so very
    confused and imperfect, that it throws no light on the point.

  Audley, the king's servant, 204.

  Augustine, the falconer 105.

  St. Austins, _i. e._ Augustines Canterbury, Abbot of, 274.

    John Sturvey, _alias_ Essex, who was Abbot from 1523 until the
    dissolution.

  Avelande Thomas, 46.

    This individual seems to have been the proprietor of some land,
    which was bought to enlarge one of the parks at Windsor. It
    consisted of two acres of meadow; the sum paid for which, 4_l._, is
    worthy of notice, as shewing the price of land at the period.

  Averay of the Botelles, 9, and Averay John of the cellar, 143.

    Clearly the same person. He appears to have been attached to the
    cellar, and from the way in which he is described "of the bottles,"
    they were perhaps entrusted to his custody.

    It is scarcely necessary to remark, that the servants or retainers
    of eminent personages were distinguished by peculiar badges, which
    were placed on the arm and other parts of their dresses.

  "Banished" to families sent out of Greenwich, 104, 125, 129, 173,
      273, _bis_.

    The last entry excepting one on this subject confirms the opinion
    relative to the former, namely, that they were families in which an
    infectious disease had appeared, and which were consequently sent
    out of Greenwich lest it should extend to the court, and endanger
    the royal person. The king however seems always to have borne the
    expences attending their removal, and which are deserving of notice
    as showing what was considered a sufficient sum for the purpose.
    Some of the persons thus "banished" were evidently above the lower
    orders, for we find that William Morley had six servants, and
    Hadstone, three.

  Baptist John, an Italian Jeweller, 97, 99.

  Barba John, a sackbut, 173.

  Barbariste Horse [i. e. Barbary Horse], to Powle that keeps the, 165.

  Barbary Horse, to the keeper of the, 133, 199, 204.

    Henry's attachment to horses is manifested by numerous entries,
    and this horse, which is in one place called a "Barra horse," and
    in another the "Barbaristo horse," was apparently a favourite
    Arabian sent from some part of Barbary, from which it derived its
    appellation. Shakespeare also speaks of a "Barbary horse:"

    "When Bolingbroke rode on _roan Barbary_, that horse
    That thou so often had bestrid."

                                                _Rich._ II. A. 5. Sc. 5.

    "You'll have your daughter cover'd with a _Barbary horse_."

                                 _Merry Wives of Windsor_, A. II. Sc. 2.

  Barberries brought, 258.

  Barde, for a, 9.

    Or BARBE, explained by Dr. Johnson to be the trapping of a horse,
    also dressed in a warlike manner, caparisoned:

    "If the _barded_ horses ran fiercely."

                                                          _Hollingshed._

    That citation as well as those by Arch. Nares, tend to prove that
    it was "a general name for the several pieces of defensive armour
    with which the horses of knights were covered in war." Little light
    is thrown upon the word by the manner in which it is used in this
    instance, excepting that it is spoken of in the singular number,
    and that it was for the king's use; but as Copeland is mentioned
    in another place, p. 18, as a mercer, it may be inferred that "the
    bard" was of cloth or silk, and which, if it was for a horse,
    renders it almost certain that it was a trapping or ornament,
    rather than a piece of armour. This idea is confirmed by the
    following passage in Hall: "The king kept a solempne justes at his
    manour of Grenewiche, he himself and xi wer on the one part and
    the marques of Exsceter with xi wer on the other parte. The kynges
    _barde_ and base and all his bend wer of cloth of gold and silver
    richely embraudered, with a mannes harte," &c. p. 707. Dr. Meyrick
    observes, "The _barde_ was the complete armour for the horse,
    though sometimes confined to the poitrail, which when made to reach
    up to the pomel of the saddle, was called _haute barde_." This
    horse armour was often covered with silk or cloth of gold.

  Baret, ----, 252.

  Barge, the king's, Johnson the master of, 7, 8, 10, 125, 182, 192,

  ----, the great, 208.

  ----, for tallowing and brenning the king's, 211.

    This item refers to the process by which the bottom of an
    uncoppered vessel is cleaned. In the sixteenth century barges were
    as important parts of royal and noble establishments, as carriages
    are in the nineteenth. Henry frequently removed from Westminster to
    Greenwich and Richmond, and was almost always conveyed by water.
    His equipage was sent in a similar manner, hence the frequent
    charges for the great and little barges, boats, watermen, &c. The
    royal barge was doubtlessly extremely splendid, for it appears that
    the painting cost upon one occasion 30_l._ and upon another Vincent
    the painter was paid for the "trimming," by which is probably meant
    slightly painting and ornamenting, 15_l._ 4_s._ 9_d._ The best
    idea of its appearance is perhaps conveyed by the barges which now
    belong to the city companies, many of which are beautifully painted
    with allegorical figures, landscapes, &c. and gorgeously ornamented.

    This item is not a little curious; 7_s._ 2_d._ for a bath for a
    horse shows the great attention which was paid to Henry's stud; yet
    it must be remembered that it was for the favourite Arabian before
    noticed as the Barbary horse.

  Battersea, 24.

  Baugh Doctor, one of the king's almoners, 9, 19, 32, 42, 59, 77, 90,
      106, 117, 134, 145, 159, 174, 182, 208, 225, 254, 276, 280.

    The large sums expended by the king in charity have been elsewhere
    noticed.

  Bayles for the king's barge, 11.

    A bail is a kind of small bucket, used for emptying the water which
    accumulates at the bottom of a boat. To "bail out a boat" is the
    expression still used by sailors for that operation.

  Baynton Master, 36, 85, 209, _bis_.

  Beagles, Robert Sheere, keeper of the, 17, 24, 31, 39, 45, 70, 79,
      94, 125, 136, 219, 290.

    These entries relate to the sums paid either as wages to the keeper
    of those animals, or for their food. His wages are said in some
    places to have been 5_s._ a month, but in others the 5_s._ a month
    is stated to be for meat for them, and as the latter entry never
    occurs near the former, and is uniformly the same in amount, it
    cannot be determined which is meant. That sum could scarcely have
    included both his wages and food for the dogs. Occasionally a
    reward of 20_s._ seems to have been bestowed upon him.

  Beagles' meat, for 187, 199, 213, 231.

  Beans brought, 218.

  Bears, [Beres] to the keeper of the king's, 14.

    If, as can scarcely be doubted, by "Beres" is meant Bears, this
    item proves that Henry had a kind of private menagerie, for it is
    not likely it could refer to the animals in the Tower.

  Beaulie, the gardener of, 4, 5, 8, 18, 36, _bis_, 39, 44, 45, _ter_,
      50, 56, 61, 72, 77, _bis_, 80, 81, 87, 96, _bis_, 103, 120, 124,
      130, 142, 147, 166, 169, 176, 188, 197, 200, 207, 209, 219, 220,
      224, 232, 235, 241, 256, 257, 264, 287, 288.

    "NEW HALL, a magnificent mansion not far from Woodham Walters,
    formerly belonging to the Butlers, Earls of Ormond, after to
    Thomas Bollen, Earl of Wiltshire, of whom Henry VIII. purchased
    it by exchange, and making costly additions to it, gave it the
    name of BEAULIEU, which, however, never prevailed among the
    generality."--_Gough's Camden_, vol. ii. p. 44. New Hall, or
    Beaulieu, is about five miles S. E. by E. of Maldon, on the side
    of the aestuary of the Blackwater.--"Leland states that when Henry
    'aedes sibi comparassit coeperunt in immensum excrescere ingentibus
    Principis impensis, novumque juxta ac elegans nomen _Belli Loci_
    adsumere.' Camden informs us that the new name never prevailed
    among the common people; and after the king's death, it is
    presumed, the place resumed its original appellation of New Hall."
    M.

  Bed, and appurtenances, paid for the making of a, 77.

    Some curious descriptions of the beds of our ancestors will be
    found in the "Testamenta Vetusta" _sparsim_, from which an idea
    can be formed of their magnificence. Even in this era of luxury
    our beds are far inferior in splendour to those of the fourteenth,
    fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries.--"In the inventory of household
    furniture of Skipton Castle, taken in 1572, we have proof that a
    state bedchamber of that period 'was not inferior in magnificence,
    as far as its accommodations went, to the same apartment in a
    modern nobleman's house.'--Whitaker's Crav. p. 328. A 'bed of downe
    with a bolster' is there valued at C_s._ 'The teaster of tynsell
    and blake vellvett with armes, havynge curtains of sylke, with
    frynges, 20_l._'"--M.

  Bedesmen, S^{r}. Torche the king's at the rood of Greenwich, 33, 188,
      122.

    A beadsman, it is scarcely requisite to remark, is an individual
    who is bound to pray for the person by whom he is supported. From
    the title "Sir" being applied to Henry's beadsman, it seems that he
    was a priest, and we learn that he received 40_s._ a year.

  Bedill Master, 26.

  Bedwell, keeper of the park of, 71.

  Beads, for two pair of, 81.

  Bekensell, or Bekensaw, a scholar of Paris, 23, 38.

  Beks Master, 41.

  Bells gilt, for hawks, paid for, 159.

    They appear to have cost 7_s._ 2_d._ the dozen, or about seven
    pence three farthings each.

  Belson John, 28.

    It is quite evident, notwithstanding his name does not indicate it,
    that this individual was a Welshman, but of what situation in life
    does not appear.

  Benet Doctor, 186.

  Benton ----, 257.

  Berewarde Sergeant, 187.

  Berkeley Lord, 29, 43, 117, 140.

    Thomas Lord Berkeley, who succeeded his brother in that dignity in
    1523, and died on the 28th January, 1583.

  Berkeley Lady, 48.

    Apparently the wife of that nobleman, namely Cecilia, widow of
    Richard Rowdon, Esq.

  Berkhampstead Park, in the county of Hertford, to the keeper of, 67.

  Betting Money, lost by the king, in bets at shooting, tennis, &c. 36,
      137, 189, 220, 226, 227, 229.

    These entries are more fully noticed under "Gambling."

  Bill, to a poor man that endeavoured to get one signed, 40.

  Bills for bringing such as were assigned, 267.

    "Bill", in both instances appears to be orders for payments. In the
    last, 23_s._ 4_d._ was probably allowed for the bearer's travelling
    expenses from London to Dover, and the former was a charitable
    donation to some unfortunate man, who was endeavouring to get an
    order signed.

  Bird Henry.--See Byrde.

  Biscuits brought, 169.

  Bitch, for keeping the little white, 127.

  ----, the king's brought, 147.

  Blackheath, for placing wine in the cellar, in the tower at, 98.

  ----, for making a wall upon the new ditch at, 213.

  Black John, the hardwareman, 23.

  Blackwall, 175.

  Blade Smith, Maryon the, 108.

    A sword-cutler.

  Blake Francis, 93.

    A footman.

  Blanch John, 28.

    A foreign minstrel.

  Blind woman, to a, being a harper, 168.

  Blount John, 16.

  Blue Mantle, 15.

    John Norbonne, who was created to that office, at Bridewell Place,
    by the Duke of Norfolk, Earl Marshal, on Allhallows-day, 1528, and
    was promoted to be Richmond Herald in 1586. He died in the tower,
    but for what reason he incurred the royal displeasure is unknown.
    The embroidery work for which he was paid 35_l._ was probably of
    the king's arms or badges.

  Boar, a wild boar's head brought, 181.

  Boars wild, brought, 5, 13.

  Board, the, that stood in the chamber over the library at Greenwich,
      brought to York Place, 87.

  Boards and nails paid for, 159.

  Boats, for the hire of, 12, 14, 25, 87, 93, 118, 177, 195, _bis_,
      208, 215.

  Boat for tallowing and brenning the, 211.

  ---- and Barge, for oars, anchor, and cable, &c. and for expenses
      whilst painting the, 262.

  ----, paid for a, for the king's embarkation and landing at Calais,
      and likewise for that of his stuff, 272, 273.

  ---- paid for, for the king's embarkation at Calais, landing at
      Dover, and crossing the water at Sandwich, 273.

  ----, for matting the, 281.

    This probably means covering the bottom of the boat on the inside
    with mats, to prevent the baggage and other articles put on board
    it from being rubbed or wetted.

  ----, to "dressing" the king's, 8, 96.

  ----, for repairing the king's, 45, 107.

  ----, a great load of books brought, 110.

  ----, paid to watermen for waiting with the, 112, 114, 120, 128, 136,
      139, 201, _bis_, 215, 219.

  ----, for mending the king's great, 164.

  ----, for cotton for lining the king's, 182.

    This is a singular entry. Lining a boat with cotton may either mean
    that cotton was used instead of oakum for caulking, or the inside
    of the after part of the boat might have been lined for the purpose
    of comfort in sitting, or leaning against the sides.

    The note on barges applies in some degree to these frequent notices
    relative to boats, excepting that the former were chiefly used for
    the conveyance of the king and persons of consequence, whilst the
    latter carried his "stuff," that is, the necessary household goods,
    &c. and servants.

  Bocher, the king's waterman, 128.

  Bokeller-maker, _i. e._ Buckle-maker, 124.

  Bolenger John, a Minstrel, 70, 129.

    In one place he is merely called a Minstrel, but in the other he is
    specifically described as a Sackbut.

  Bolayn Anthony de, a merchant of Paris, 15.

  Boleyn Sir Edward, Knt. 10, 44.

    Apparently the uncle of the celebrated Ann Boleyn. He married Ann,
    daughter and heiress of Sir John Tempest, but little more seems to
    be known of him.

  Boleyn Lady Ann, 4, _bis_, 13, 44, 47, 50, 61, 72, 74, 88, _bis_,
      90, 95, 97, _bis_, 98, _bis_, 101, 128, 179, 183, 217, 222, 223,
      245.--See Pembroke.

    Some observations on these entries will be found at the
    commencement of the volume.

  Bolougne, 268, _saepe_.

  ----, paid the king's offering to our Lady of, 272.

    The king was at Bologne in November, 1532, and offered 11_s._ 3_d._
    to the image of our Lady of that place.

  Bolts and Rings for, 251.

    We learn from this entry that when the king was in progress, a
    smith attended with rings and bolts for his Majesty's sleeping
    apartments.

  Bone Sir Robert, 160.

    This individual was overseer of the buildings at Grafton, from
    which it would seem that he was an architect. The title "Sir,"
    probably implies that he was a priest, knighthood being then
    too highly estimated to be conferred upon any but persons of
    consequence.

  Bonnets for the King, 15.

  ---- paid for, 23, 63, 94, 99, 123.

    The word bonnet was used nearly synonymously with hat. They were
    usually made of cloth, and were sometimes ornamented with feathers,
    gold buttons, &c.

  ---- Milan, for, 24, 173.

    What a Milan bonnet was, does not exactly appear. In both instances
    they were bought for the king's fool.

  ---- night, for two scarlet, 218.

  Bonvice Anthony, 82.

  Books paid for, 18, 44.

  ----, Mass, 24.

    The price of six Mass books with velvet to cover them was 3_l._
    11_s._

  ---- brought, 85, 89, _ter_, 106, 109, 110, 112, 116, 137, 190, 274.

    With the exception of the last entry of a book given to the King
    at Canterbury, in November 1532, all the notices refer to books
    sent by Abbots and Priors, or of the removal of boat loads of books
    from one palace to another, between October 1530 and January 1532,
    but chiefly early in 1531, and there can be little doubt that
    they related to the subject which then occupied Henry's mind, his
    divorce.

  ----, inventory of, brought, 89.

    The inventory in question was clearly the catalogue of the library
    in the Abbey of Reading, and was doubtlessly sent to enable Henry
    to ascertain if it contained any thing relative to the theological
    point in which he was then so deeply interested.

  ----, for printed, 101.

  ----, paid to an Armourer for garnishing, 123, 214.

    Probably for putting on clasps.

  ----, paid for vellum and other "stuff" for the king's, 137.

  ---- sent to the bookbinder, 255.

  Bookbinder, paid the, 189.

  Boots, paid for, 30, 31, 123, 139, 183, 259, 264.

  Bone ----, one of the hunt, 26.

  Botelles, _i. e._ Bottles to Averay of the, 9.--See Averay.

  Bottle for a, to contain salad oil, 12.

  Boucher to, and his fellow on going to Calais, 124.

  Bourchier Sir John, 54, 231.

    Apparently Lord Berners.--See Berners.

  Bouilloigne Anthony, 138.

    A French merchant.

  Bowge Skins, for, 90.

    Budge skins. Fur, but more properly lamb's fur. They appear to have
    cost about 2_s._ 3_d._ per dozen.

  Bowland, one of the stable, 17.

  Bowls, money won of the king at, 20, 209, 210, _bis_, 211, _bis_,
      212, 216, _saepe_, 229, 278.

  Bowling Alley, at Eltham, for making the, 218.

    A bowling alley is a covered space for that game instead of a
    bowling green; the expenses of making the one at Eltham are said to
    have been 4_l._ 4_s._ 8_d._

  Bowman Thomas, 187.

  Boworth, 270.

  Bows for, 47, 50, 64, 158, 159, 265.

  ----, stone, brought, 104.

    A bow for shooting stones.

  ----, yeoman of the king's, 75, 107.

  ---- fetched, 146.

  ----, paid to Bird for his fee, for the, 163, 263.

  ----, paid for pelletts, _i. e._ shot for the stone, 220.

  Bowstaves for, for the king's use, 267.

  Bowyer the, 24, 50, 55, 180.

  Boys of the Stable, 3, 11, 12, _bis_, 18, 19, _bis_, 22, 23, _bis_,
      29, 30, 31, 39, 44.

    These items all appear to refer to the same persons, who seem to
    have been boys maintained for the purpose of riding race horses.

  Boy, to one, that ran a nag, 39.

  ---- of the private chamber, 63.

  ----, the carriage of, to Bury, and their expenses at, paid for, 81.

  Boy, a, sent from Lord Dacres to the king, 206.

    Considerable trouble is said to have been used in procuring boys
    for the purpose of riding the king's racing horses, and for his
    chapel; and the expenses of sending one from the borders of
    Scotland appear to have amounted to 3_l._ 6_s._ 8_d._

  Brace of dogs brought, 156.

  Brakes for mowing those in Greenwich Park, 230, 256.

    Brakes are explained both by Dr. Johnson and Archdeacon Nares to
    be a thicket of brambles or thorns. The privilege of "mowing the
    brakes" is still reserved to the keepers of the royal parks in the
    instrument by which they are appointed. It possibly meant cutting
    the underwood.

  Brandon Richard, 30, _bis_, 287, a Falconer.

  Braser, for a, 46.

    Worn by archers on their left arms.

  Brass, paid for two curtalls [_i. e._ quintals] of, 170.

  Brawn brought, 89.

  Browtherer, _i. e._ the Embroiderer's bill, 128.

  Bray Lord, 20.

    Edmund, first Lord Bray. He was summoned to Parliament in 1529, and
    died in 1539.

  Breams brought, 62.

  ---- bake, brought, 32.

  Breech at Woolwich. See Woolwich.

  Breme Richard, 128.

  Brennyng the barge, &c. for, 211. See Barge.

  Brereton Bryan A, 17, 74.

  Brereton William, 51.

    A "Master Brereton" who was a gentleman of the privy chamber, was
    sent from the king to Wolsey at Southwell after his disgrace.--See
    Cavendish's Life of Wolsey, p. 253. It was apparently this
    individual who was executed in consequence of his supposed
    connexion with Ann Boleyn.

  Bridewell, to one that pretended a title to, 6.

    Henry the Eighth erected a magnificent house on the scite of the
    ancient one of St. Bride, for the reception of Charles the Fifth,
    in 1522, and called it Bridewell. The king often lodged there, and
    held a parliament in it in 1525. It was the residence of Katherine
    in 1529, pending the proceedings relative to her divorce. Edward
    the Sixth gave it to the corporation of the city of London for an
    hospital. Why a person who pretended to have a title to it should
    be rewarded with 20_s._ it is difficult even to guess.

  ----, 118, 122, 132.

  Bridge, for a private, at York Place, 20, 82, 93, 109.

    Cavendish, in his life of Wolsey, speaking of the Cardinal's
    entertainments of Henry at York House, now Whitehall, says, "They
    thereupon looking out of the windows into Thames, returned again
    and showed him that it seemed to them there should be some noblemen
    and strangers arrived at _his bridge_ as ambassadors from some
    foreign prince." Ed. Singer, v. 1, p. 151. Whether it was this
    bridge which Needham was paid for finishing in January, 1530,
    is uncertain, but in July following he was employed to build a
    _private_ bridge.

  Briges Thomas, 249.

  ---- John, 171.

  Broaches for, 82.

  Broach with an amethyst, for a, 163, 262.

  Broadheads for, 46.

  Brockborow park, to the keeper of, 70, 162.

    Apparently, Brogborough Park, near Amphill, in Bedfordshire.

  Brokes Master, 154, 155.

  Brombery park, to the keepers of, in reward and to their wives for
      meat and drink, 238.

    Query, if this be not intended for Brogborough Park.

  Brooms brought, 159.

  Brown John, a shooter, 65.

    Query, a game-keeper.

  Brown William, 227.

  Brown ----, 115, 237.

  Browne Sir Anthony, 7, 26, 46, 75, 92, 97, 148, 153.

    This well known favourite of Henry the Eighth was some years
    afterwards appointed Master of the Horse, and created a Knight of
    the Garter, and died in 1540.

  ---- John, 201.

  Bruges satin, doublets of, 23.

  ---- for, 222.

  Bryan Sir Francis, 9, 60, 72, 76, 83, 209, 211, 212, 216, 232, 243,
      _bis_, 244, 263, 274, 275, _bis_, 278.

    Many of the entries respecting Sir Francis Bryan, one of the
    brightest ornaments of Henry's court, tend to confirm the idea of
    the intimacy between him and his sovereign. They show that he was
    constantly the king's companion in his amusements at shovel board,
    bowls, dice, primero, and other games; and on one occasion we find
    50_l._ was given to his servant as "a token from the king to him,"
    an expression which no where else occurs, and which, it would seem,
    was a delicate manner of making him a pecuniary present. He was
    the only son of Sir Thomas Bryan, who died in 1517, and was one
    of Henry the Eighth's Gentlemen of the Bedchamber. Bryan was the
    author of some sonnets which are inserted amongst those of the
    Earl of Surrey; and he is consequently noticed by Dr. Nott, in his
    elegant edition of that nobleman's productions. Hall also states
    many curious facts respecting him, particularly of the loss of one
    of his eyes at a tilting match.

  Bryan, keeper of greyhounds, 58.

  Bryce John, 155.

  Bucks brought, 26, 49, 55, 60, _bis_, 67, 136, 150, 194, 229, 232.

  ----, paid to the guard for eating a, 156.

    Why the guard should have been paid 40_s._ for eating a buck is not
    easily explained. If the guard consisted of very few persons, it
    might have been a sort of wager.

  Buck, to the wife, where the king shot at a tame, 171.

  Buckhounds, the king's private, 19.

  ----, for canvas to cover a cart for carrying the, 154.

    When the king went to Ampthill, it seems that his hounds were sent
    there also, for the purpose of hunting.

  ----, paid to the office of the, for killing the first buck, 157.

  ----, to the office of the, 161, 257.

  Buckhunts, paid to the, 254.

    So little is known of the regulations of this office, that the
    Editor acknowledges himself ignorant of the cause of these payments.

  Buckingham, 157, 242.

  ----, to the keeper of the house at, 242.

  Buckram for, 223, _bis_.

  Buildings for the king's, 161.

  ----, the king's at York Place, money for, 36.

  ----, the king's, at the More, 40, 49.

  ---- at Hounsdon, for the, 42, 60, 73, 81, 111, 136, 174, 211.

  ---- at Westminster, for the king's, 228.

    Henry's taste for building has been often noticed, and these
    payments were for its gratification.

  Bukworth ----, 229.

  Bulkeley Master, 151.

  Bulloyne, [Bologne], 54.

  Bulstrode Lady, 4, 36, 112.

  Burdet William, 142, 263.

  Burial, paid the expenses of William Doddesworth's, 141.

  ----, paid by way of alms at that of Davy the footman, 172.

    We are here presented with the expences attendant on the funeral
    of two menial servants; in one case it was sixteen, in the other
    fifteen shillings.

  Bury, 81.

  Business, the king's, money laid out for, by Thomas Alvord, 96.

  Buttons of gold for caps, 25, 33.

  Butts Doctor, 262.

    From the following passage in Cavendish's life of Wolsey, we
    learn that he was one of the king's physicians. "At Christmas he
    [Wolsey] fell sore sick that he was likely to die. Wherof the king
    being advertised was very sorry therefore, and sent Doctor Buttes,
    his grace's physician, unto him, to see in what estate he was."
    Cavendish then gives a conversation between Henry and the Doctor
    on the Cardinal's illness. Vol. i. pp. 220, 1, 2. There is also in
    that valuable work an engraving of a contemporary illumination,
    representing Butts receiving tokens of favour from Ann Boleyn for
    Wolsey. Dr. Butts is honourably commemorated by Fox, as the friend
    of Bishop Latimer. See also Gilpin's Life of Latimer, p. 42-45.

    pieces, of all colours, as velvet, satin, damask, _caffa_,
    taffeta, grograine, sarcenet, and of other not in my
    remembrance."--Cavendish, vol. i. p. 182.

  Cambridge, the Vice Chancellor of, 30.

    John Watson.

  ----, to Mr. Latimer and other scholars of, 73.

    This item is of much interest. Gilpin, in his life of Latimer,
    says, that Dr. Butts, the king's physician, being sent to Cambridge
    relative to the divorce, applied to Latimer for his opinion and
    that of his friends upon the abstruse points in dispute, and
    finding them favourable to his wishes, brought Latimer with him to
    Court. It is possible that the entry in question referred to that
    circumstance; but it is most probable from the words of it that
    Latimer and the other scholars were afterwards sent for, instead of
    accompanying Butts.

  Candish, servant of the Duke of Suffolk, 26, 154, 251.

  Capell Sir Giles, 6, 10, 42, 181.

    Ancestor of the present Earl of Essex. He was knighted for his
    valour at the battle of Spurs, and is said to have attended Henry
    to Calais in 1532.

  Capon, a fat, given, 178.

  Capons brought, 50, 181, 207, 220.

  Caps. See Night and Riding.

  ---- for, 33, 283.

  ---- for the riding boys, 101.

  ----, riding described, paid for, 173.

  Cards, money delivered to the king to play at, 113, 115.

  ----, money lost at, 272, 276, 278.

    The use of Cards in England was very common long before the period
    here alluded to, and it is only necessary to refer those who wish
    for ample information, to Mr. Singer's interesting inquiries
    on the subject. The following notices had however escaped his
    researches, though one of them is alluded to in a letter in the
    appendix to his work. In the 1 Edward IV. 1461, it was enacted,
    "that noo lord nor other personne of lower astate condicion or
    degree, whatsoever he be, suffer any Dicyng or pleiyng at _Cardes_
    within his hous or elles where he may be let it, of any of his
    servauntes or other oute of the xij dayes of Cristmasse, and yf
    any presume to doo the contrarie at any tyme that he avoyde hym
    oute of his hous and service." It is then provided that, "noon
    Hosteler, Tavener, Vitailler, Artificer or Housholder or other use
    any such play or suffre to be used any such play in their houses or
    elleswhere upon payne of prisonement and other arbitrarie at the
    kynges wille."--_Rot. Parl._ vol. 5, p. 488. In the 3 and 4 Edw.
    IV. 1463-4, "_Cardes_ for pleiyng" were forbidden to be imported
    and sold in this Country, "upon peyne to forfeit theym."--_Ibid._
    p. 507. In the 12th and 14th years of the same monarch, in a
    statute respecting the scarcity of bow staves it is said, "that
    the occupation of shotyng is thus discontynued and almost lefte,
    and the said Yomen in defaute of such Bowes, nowe usen unlawfull
    occupations as pleiyng at the _Cardes_, Dise plaiyng," &c.--_Ibid._
    vol. vi. p. 156. The games at which Henry played appear to be
    Primero and Imperial. "Specimens of the court cards of a pack of
    the time of Henry VII. are given in Strutt's _Sports and Pastimes_,
    from the originals in the possession of Francis Douce, Esq."--M*.

  Cardinal, a servant of the, 103.

    It is too generally known to require repetition, that when Wolsey
    fell into disgrace, the king seized upon all his effect. This item
    informs us that the servant who brought the Cardinal's chariot
    horses received 20_s._

  ----'s goods, the expenses of a ship for bringing the, 112.

    This entry must refer to the expenses of bringing such part of the
    Cardinal's effects as were either at York or Winchester; but most
    probably the former, in which case it may be concluded that they
    were shipped at Hull.

  ----, to Sir William Kingston for his expenses when he was sent to
      bring up the, 115.

    Sir William Kingston was sent by Henry to bring up, or in fact to
    take the Cardinal into custody, in November 1530, and found him at
    Sheffield Park, under the _surveillance_ of the Earl of Shrewsbury.
    The particulars of his interview and subsequent proceedings, until
    death released his prisoner from the fangs of his tyrannical
    master, on Tuesday the 29th of that month, are fully related by
    Cavendish.--_Ed. Singer_, vol. i. p. 302, _et seq._ Kingston's
    expenses on that journey were, it seems, 41_l._ 10_s._ 10_d._; but
    which were not paid him until the ensuing March.

  Cardinal, paid for silk, for the, 116.

    This entry must have referred to a transaction which took place
    many months before.

  ----'s plate and stuff, paid people for attending to the, 123.

  ----'s stuff for keeping the, 126.

    We learn from this entry that Edward Lloyd, a person belonging
    to the king's wardrobe, was entrusted with the charge of all the
    Cardinal's goods. See also the item on the subject in p. 112, which
    has just been noticed.

  Carew Sir Nicholas, 119, _bis_.

    A Knight of the Garter, Master of the Horse, and Lieutenant of
    Calais. He was, says the most elegant of living biographers,
    "Henry's constant companion in all the splendid and romantic
    sports of his court, administered successfully to his pleasures,
    and was not without some secret share in his councils."--_Lodge's
    Illustrious Portraits._ Carew, however, like so many of his
    contemporaries, afterwards incurred the royal displeasure, and
    that displeasure was, in his case too, but the prelude to disgrace
    and death. He was arrested upon a suspicion of high treason, and
    beheaded on the 3rd March, 1539. He married Elizabeth, the sister
    of Sir Francis Bryan, who has been before mentioned in these
    notes, by whom he left issue. Whether it was this lady or her
    mother-in-law, Magdalen, daughter of Sir Robert Oxenbridge, widow
    of Sir Richard Carew, who is alluded to in the following entry, is
    not certain, but most probably the latter.

  ---- Lady, 6.

  Carpenter, to Needham, the king's, 82, 93, 109, 138.

  ---- labour, for, 234.

  Carpes brought, 62, 74, 100, 267.

  Carriage the, that came from Oxford, 3.

    What "the Carriage" was which is here mentioned is unknown.

  Carriage of deer, for the, 19.

  ---- of nets, for the, 52.

  ---- of boys to Bury, 81.

  ---- of the king's stuff, paid for the, 58, 159.

  Carrier, a dog given, which was a, 251.

    Evidently a dog which had been taught to fetch and carry.

  Cart, paid for a, and things belonging to it, 154, 156.

  ---- with the hounds for covering &c., for the, 233, 234.

  Carter John, a waterman, 47, 155, 164, 169, 181, 182, 193, 197, 201,
      208, 211, _ter_, 215, 247, 262, 266, 270, 277, 278, 279, _bis_,
      281.

  Carters, to the, that came from Oxford, 3.

  Cary Thomas, 10, 59, 67, 81, 143, 144, 145, 226.

    The greater part of these entries relate to money given "in
    reward," but two or three of them are of shooting money, whence it
    may be inferred that he was "one of the shooters" or game keepers.

  ---- John, 41.

  Cast of Lanretts brought, 141, 149.

    A cast of lannerets, is a couple or set of hawks.--_See Lannerett,
    infra._

  ---- of Falcons brought, 198.

    A couple of falcons.

  Catalogue of books brought, 89. See Books.

  Cavalcant John, apparently a merchant, 144, 198.

  Cawsham Park, to the keeper of, 249.

    Caversham Park, in Oxfordshire.

  Cecill Richard, Groom of the Robes, 4, 8, 68, 159, 168, 274.

    The father of William the first and celebrated Lord Burleigh. He
    was Groom and afterwards Yeoman of the Robes, and received several
    grants of lands from Henry the Eighth. He died in May, 1552.

  Cele, _vide_ Seal.

  Cellar, Serjeant of the, 24, 32, 113, 115, 190, 216, 278.

    Only two of these entries relate to expenses connected with this
    individual's official situation. The others were payments of money
    lost to him by the king at dice, cards, and bowls, excepting on
    one occasion, when money was paid him to be His Majesty's partner
    at one of these games. It is thus manifest that he enjoyed a
    large share of the king's personal favour. His name has not been
    precisely ascertained. Richard Hill, whose widow remarried Sir John
    Mason, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, was Serjeant of the
    Cellar in this reign, but in what years is uncertain.

  ----, the king's privy wine laid in, 182.

  Cellaring wine, paid for, 98, 99, _bis_.

  Chadwyke Peter, embroiderer, 103.

  Chain, for a gold, 103.

  ----, for a, 268.

  Chamber, the children of the king's, 155.

  ----, to a groom of the, 157, 159, 204.

  Chamberlain, Lord, 5, 13, 60, 61, 152, 189, 272.

  Chambers Doctor, 194, 243.

    A Physician.

  Chancellor of France, 48.

  Chape, a, for knives, paid for, 168.

    A Chape, is explained in Todd's Johnson to be "the catch of any
    thing by which it is held in its place, as the hook of a scabbard
    by which it sticks in the belt; the point by which a buckle is
    held to the back-strap;" also, "a brass or silver tip or case
    that strengthens the end of the scabbard of a sword." "'Chape' is
    sometimes applied to the hook of a scabbard, and at others to what
    is by Heralds termed the crampet, in which case the other metallic
    pieces on the scabbard are called Lockets. Chape like Chapter,
    seems to be derived from Caput."--M*.

  Chapel, Master Cole, Subdean of the kings, 13, 82.

  ---- feast, for the, 64, 242.

  ----, stuff for washing the, 93.

    The surplices, vestments, &c.

  ---- men, to the, 149.

  ----, to the hermit of Deptford, to repair his, 150.

  ----, to the Dean of the king's, for the chapel feast, "the old
      ordinary reward," 242.

  Chapman keeper of the garden at Hamptoncourt, 63, 68, 249, 253.

  Chariot horses, brought, 103.

    Doctor Percy in his notes on The Northumberland Household Book
    conjectures that a chariot "bore no resemblance to the modern
    carriage of that name, nor was intended for the same use, but was
    simply a large waggon drawn by six or seven of the stronger kind
    of horses, called, on that account, 'large trotting horses.'"
    Mr. Markland, in his dissertation on Carriages in England,
    _Archaeologia_, vol. xx. p. 405, coincides with the view taken
    of the point by Bishop Percy, and has cited several proofs in
    confirmation of it. Unfortunately the entry in question throws no
    light on the point, for the words "the chariot horses," might be
    used in the modern acceptation or in that of those gentlemen, who
    are however borne out in their opinion by the authorities which
    they have adduced, and which are farther supported by the will of
    Bartholomew Lord Burghersh, in 1369, who speaks of the "chariot"
    which shall carry his corpse to the grave. Humphrey, Earl of
    Hereford, in 1861, left legacies to his "vj charetters."

  Charity, _vide_ Alms.

  Chartesaye, _i. e._ Chelsea, 77, 148, _bis_, 253.

  Chamley Master, 280.

  "Chast greyhounds," the king's brought, 58, 174.

    What was meant by the king's chaste greyhounds is difficult to
    explain. That certain part of the greyhounds should be confined to
    perpetual chastity, is not a little curious, if such was the fact;
    but might not the word chaste have been used for "chace," _i. e._
    greyhounds kept for the sole purposes of coursing, as distinguished
    from those which were admitted to the parlour, and to the presence
    of their royal master?

  Chelsea, _vide_ Chartesaye.

  Cherries brought, 47, 56, _bis_, 57, 58, 143, 145, 148, _bis_, 225,
      _bis_, 228, 231, 232.

  Cheses, Lanthony brought, 220.

  ---- brought, 4, 6, 49, 53, 89, 91, 154, 173, 237, 277.

  ---- for the hand guns, for a, 159.

  Cheyney John, 46.

  ---- Sir Thomas, 6, 10, 238, 216, 265.

    The Governor of Rochester Castle, and afterwards a Knight of the
    Garter, Warden of the Cinque Ports, and Treasurer of the Household
    to Edward the Sixth. In the 12th Hen. VIII. he was one of the
    Challengers against all gentlemen in feats of arms for thirty
    days, at the meeting of the Cloth of Gold, and as is evident from
    one of these entries, was frequently admitted to the society, and
    stood high in the favour of Henry, who it would seem, from the next
    entry, stopped at his house in Kent, on his road to Calais, in
    1532. He died in 1559.

  ----'s park, to the keeper of, and to his servants, 266, _bis_.

  Chickens brought, 126, 131, 193, 207, 215, 218, 229, 230, 242, 255,
      264.

  ----, paid to one for his expenses on his journey to provide, 140.

  ---- of the stable, for gere, for the, 182.

  ----, to a poor man that had thirteen, 93.

  ----, to the Master of the, 287, 291.

    From the ordinances made at Eltham, for the regulation of the
    household, it appears, that he was the head of the "Gentlemen of
    the Chapel," and was allowed 30_l._ per annum for his wages.

  ----, expenses for the, 268. See Boys.

  Chippings for hounds, paid for, 7, 19, 24, 45, 49.

    Fragments for their food.

  Choristers of Windsor, 58, 140, 214.

  Christening of a child, paid on the, 106, 117, 136, 145.

    It may perhaps be inferred that on each of these occasions the king
    was one of the sponsors.

  Christmas, money given against, 11, _bis_.

  Christopher, Milliner, 25, 63, 65, 76, 99, 151, 173, _bis_.

  Citrons brought, 80.

      _ter_, 95, _saepe_, 129, _ter_, 130, _ter_, 181, 192, 198, 200,
      221, 280, 285, 287, 288, _ter_.

    All of these numerous entries were either payments of his wages or
    for food for the hawks.

  ---- Samson, 209.

  Cloak, paid for a, for Lady Ann, all the materials of which are
      minutely noticed, 222, 223.

    The manner in which even the most trifling article connected with
    this cloak is mentioned is not a little amusing. The whole expence
    attending it was 9_l._ 4_s._ 8_d._

  Clock, to the keeper of, at Hampton Court, 26.

  ----, paid the French, 189.

  ----, to a, 215, _bis_.

    About the reign of Henry the Eighth clocks became a favourite
    article of luxury, and these entries shew the heavy sums which
    that monarch spent in the purchase of them. At the royal palaces
    of Hampton Court and Westminster it seems a person was specially
    appointed to regulate the clocks. "We have the price of a clock
    at a very early period, anno 1292, _novum orologium magnum in
    Ecclesia (Cantuariensi) pretium_, 30_l._"--Dart's Cant. App. p. 3.
    "Mr. Walpole has in his possession a clock, which appears by the
    inscription to have been a present from Henry VIII. to Anne Boleyn.
    Poynet, Bishop of Winchester, gave an astronomical clock to the
    same king.--Buckman's _His. Invent._ vol. i. p. 454."--M.

  Coffer of Cypress wood, a, 184.

    Cypress seems to have been held in much esteem for boxes from an
    early period. We find that John of Gaunt, in 1397, speaks of "a
    little box of Cypress wood," in his will. The following extract
    from "an account of Church Plate Money, Gold, and Silver Images,"
    &c. delivered to Henry the Eighth, printed in "Memoirs of the
    Antiquities of Great Britain, relating to the Reformation," from
    the original, in the Bodleian Library, is a curious illustration
    of "Coffers."--"Paid, William Grene, the King's Coffer Maker for
    makyng of a coffer, covered with fustyan of Naples and beinge full

  Cromer Doctor, 137.

  Cromwell Master, 101, 224, 261, 267, _ter_, 268.

    This individual was afterwards the celebrated Earl of Essex. It is
    well known that he was taken into Henry's service on the fall of
    his former master, Wolsey, and was Knighted in the year when his
    name first occurs in these accounts, after which time he made rapid
    progress in the King's favour. These entries respecting Cromwell
    add in no other way to what is recorded of him, than as they
    confirm the opinion that he was frequently employed on services
    which were of a secret nature. The one relating to the payment of
    the king's tomb will be more fully noticed elsewhere, and in June,
    1532, we find him presenting Henry with "Sucado and marmalade;" but
    the most remarkable entries are of large sums paid to him "by the
    king's commandment," without mentioning for what purposes. Indeed,
    on one occasion, there is a particular appearance of mystery in
    the disbursement. It is a payment to the king's jeweller of 46_l._
    13_s._ 4_d._, "Maister Cromwell knowing to what use it should be
    employed unto." The entries alluded to all occur in October, 1532,
    and the sums paid to him amounted to 826_l._ 6_s._ 8_d._, which
    may be supposed to have been privately expended at Boulogne, in
    relation to the interview with the French Monarch; but it must be
    remembered that Henry is, by some writers, supposed to have married
    Anne Boleyn early in the November following; hence, it is possible
    that these payments were in some way connected with that event.

    cross bow used with this arrow was wood instead of steel. See the

  Cucumbers brought, 72, 163, 241, 242, 250, 264.

  Cupboards, for, with and without Ambreys, 93.

    This entry is more particularly noticed under "Ambrys," but a few
    words will here be said on the word "Cupboard." Some grounds exist
    for considering that it formerly meant a very different piece of
    furniture than a "case with shelves," as Dr. Johnson describes
    it, and as it is explained by Archd. Nares. The entry referred to
    in these accounts, it is true, appears to have been of an article
    resembling a modern cupboard; but it is by no means certain that
    such is the fact. From the following passage it would seem that the
    word was used for a kind of closet. Speaking of Lord Shrewsbury
    having appeared before the Privy Council of Queen Elizabeth to
    vindicate himself from some charges brought against him, a writer
    of the period says, "Yet, for that he did so instantly require to
    have their aunswere to that which he had propounded, his Lordship
    was desired to withdrawe himselfe from the table to the _cupbord_,
    which he did, and so uppon some consultacion amonge the reste of
    their Lordships then sittinge, his Lordship beinge agayn called to
    his place, it was," &c.--_Lodge's Illustrations_, vol. ii. p. 298.
    It could scarcely have been meant that Shrewsbury merely quitted
    the Council table and went to where the cupboard was placed, at a
    distant part of the room. The following extract however does not
    support the opinion, that a cupboard was a closet; but it could
    not have resembled the modern piece of furniture of that name.
    Cavendish, speaking of the chamber in which Cardinal Wolsey died,
    says "the windows being close shut, having wax lights burning
    _upon the cupboard_," &c. vol. i. p. 318. It is quite certain
    that an article called a cupboard was sometimes moveable. Robert
    Frevyll, by his will dated in 1521, gives his son John, among other
    articles, "a stone cobard in the hall."--_Testamenta Vetusta_, vol.
    ii. p. 575. Hall thus uses the word. "The Dutchmen bring over iron,
    tymber, lether, and weynskot ready wrought, as nayles, lockes,
    basketts, _cupbordes_, stools, tables, chestes, gyrdels with
    poyntes," &c. p. 587. In the account of the furniture of Henry the
    Eighth's palaces, in the _Harleian_ MS., 1419, the word "cuppbord"
    frequently occurs; and the following extract supports the opinion,
    that it did not resemble the article now known by that name. "Item,
    one large cuppbord carpet of grene clothe of gold, with workes
    lyned with bockeram, conteyning in lengthe three yards iij q'ters,
    and three bredthes of the same cloth of gold," f. 20.

    died in November, 1563.

  Darcy lord, 104, 160.

    Thomas Darcy. He was summoned to Parliament as Lord Darcy in 1509,
    and became a Knight of the Garter; but having delivered Pontefract
    castle to the rebels under Robert Aske, he was arraigned on a
    charge of high treason, found guilty, and beheaded on the 20th
    June, 1538.

  ---- Sir Arthur, 117, 136.

    Second son of Lord Darcy just mentioned. Dugdale says, that in
    September, 1534, he was made captain of Jersey, and in the 5 Ed.
    VI. Lieutenant of the Tower of London. It is singular, that in
    the only instances in which he is noticed in these accounts, it
    should be on similar occasions, the repayment of money which he had
    disbursed at christenings. He died in 1561, s. p.

  David St. money given for keeping his feast, 28, 114, 197.

    These were probably gifts to Welshmen, to enable them to celebrate
    the feast of their tutelar saint. In Mr. Ellis's _Original
    Letters_, First Series, v. i. p. 273, the following notice occurs
    among the expences of the Household of the Princess Mary between
    1536 and 1545, and which tends to illustrate these entries: "Item,
    geven amongs the yeomen of the King's guard, bringing a leke to my
    lady's Grace on Saynt David's day, xv_s._"--M.

  Davy Hugh, servant to the Princess Mary, 148.

  ---- Little, 144.

  ----, with a slit nose, 64.

    This elegant soubriquet seems to have been used to distinguish him
    from Hugh Davy and little Davy--all of whom had perhaps the same
    baptismal name.

  ---- the footman, paid for his burial expenses, 172.

  ---- the footman's wife, to, 176.

    A gratuity given to the widow of the servant whose burial expenses

  Dean Sub, of the king's Chapel, to the, 46, 64, 149.

  Deboyen Baron, in Ireland, 136.

    It is difficult to say who was the individual referred to. The only
    name at all resembling it in the Irish Peerage, about the period,
    is Dunboyne; but that title was not conferred until 1537, six years
    after the date in question, when Sir Edmund Butler was so created.

  Derby Earl of, 168, 256.

    Edward Stanley, third Earl of Derby, to which title he succeeded
    in 1521, and died in 1574. The first entry is of 3_l._ 6_s._ 8_d._
    paid at the christening of his lordship's son on the 4th October,
    1531. The Earl had issue four sons, but as the date of their births
    does not occur in the peerages, it is impossible to say to which
    this item referred.

  Desk a, garnished with laten and gold, 123.

  Dessefort Anthony, a brush merchant, 243.

  Dials for, 65, 91.

  Dice, money given to the king to play at, and money lost by him at,
      20, 32, 243, _bis_, 246, 248, 267, 268, 270, 271, 278.

    Dice has been a favourite amusement in this country for many
    centuries, and Mr. Singer, in his interesting volume on Playing
    Cards, gives many curious particulars on the subject. Under the
    word "Cards" _ante_, extracts from the statutes restricting the use
    of them in the reign of Edward IV. have been inserted, to which the
    following from the Rolls of Parliament, of the 2 Hen. IV. 1410, may
    be an acceptable addition. The Commons prayed that servants and
    labourers who offended against the statute prohibiting them to play
    at "Coites, _dys_, gettre de Peer, Kayles, and autres tieux Jeues,"
    should be enforced; to the enactments in which that Parliament
    added a punishment of six days, whilst such Mayors as neglected
    to enforce it were to be fined 20_s._ and Constables 6_s._
    8_d._--Vol. iii. p. 643. In the 17 Ed. IV. 1477, a statute was
    enacted prohibiting "newe ymagined pleys called Closshe, Keyles,
    half Bowle, Handyn and Handowte, and Queke borde," it was recited
    that "the Lawes of the Lond" forbad "any unlawful plays, as _Dise_,
    Coyte, Fote ball, and such like Plays, but that every person myghty
    and able in bodie should use his bowe by cause that the defense of
    this lond stondeth much by archers."

  Dodisworth Walter, 160, 162, 165, 167, 171, 176, 180, 181, 187, 194,
      197, 205, 210, 215, 222, 226, 229, 236, 241, 244, 246, 251, 265,

  ----, paid to a person for making dogs draw water, 67.

    This is the second entry relative to dogs being taught to perform
    certain tricks, for a dog has been before spoken of "that was a
    carrier."

  Domingo, 17, 32, 33, 37, 190, 204, 205, 267, 270.

    This individual is thus noticed by Skelton:

    ----al his trust hanges
    In Balthosor, which healed
    _Domingo's_ nose, that was wheled:
    That Lumberdes nose mean I
    That standeth yet awry,
    It was not healed alderbest.
    It standeth somwhat on the west,
    I meane _Domingo Lomelyn_
    That was wonte to win
    Muche money of the Kyng
    At the cardes and haserding.
    Balthasor that healed _Domingo's_ _n_ose
    From the puskilde pocky pose, &c.

         Skelton's Poems, "Why come ye not to Court," Ed. 1736, p. 175.

    The above extract presents us with the surname of Domingo, states
    that he was a Lombard, and had been under the professional care of
    Dr. Balthazar. Most of the entries in which he is mentioned relate
    to payments of money that he had won from the king at cards and
    dice, and which in less than three years amounted to above 620_l._
    As the circumstance is alluded to by Skelton, the accuracy of that
    part, at least, of his account of Domingo is established. He was,
    like Palmer and others, one of Henry's "diverting vagabonds," and
    seems to have accompanied His Majesty wherever he went, for we find
    that he was with him at Calais in October, 1532.

  Dompue, to one who rode two horses at once, 218.

    This word does not occur in any of the usual Glossaries of
    Dictionaries. In the absence of any thing positive as to its
    meaning, a conjecture may be hazarded, and if erroneous perhaps
    forgiven. "Domter un cheval" is to break in a horse. Might not then
    a _Dompue_ or _Dompne_, for it is doubtful in which way the word is
    spelt, mean a horse breaker, and which would fully agree with the
    sense in which it is here used?

    December, 1530.

    The entry relating to him is of 7_l._ 14_s._ paid to his servants
    for bringing two prisoners from Cornwall to London. A similar
    payment was made to him in 1491, "Item, to the servants of Piers
    Edgecombe that brought unto us two prisoners, fyve marks." Ellis's

    tell them that he had sent Sir Thomas Bolen, newly created Earl of
    Wiltshire and Ormond, with John Stokesley, elect bishop of London,
    and Edward Lee, as his ambassadors to the Emperor," on the subject
    of the divorce. The payment of the money for their expences was not
    however made until the 24th January following. We here learn that
    it amounted to 743_l._ 8_s._

    Henry Courtenay, eleventh earl of Devon, who was elevated to the
    Marquisate of Exeter in 1525. This distinguished nobleman was the
    son of William, Earl of Devon, by Katherine, youngest daughter of
    King Edward the Fourth, and was consequently first cousin to Henry,
    a relationship which placed him much too near to the crown to be
    compatible with his safety; and, in 1538, he was suspected of high
    treason. Suspicion was then equivalent to guilt, and the Marquess
    was beheaded on Tower Hill, on the 9th of January 1539. "Of all
    victims of the jealous tyrant," the elegant Gibbon justly remarks,
    "the Marquess of Exeter is one of the most noble and guiltless."
    The entries in these accounts throw no light upon his character,
    nor are they of much interest, for they consist merely of rewards
    to his servants, or bringing presents of hounds to the King.

  Eyred, for bringing a hawk that was, 60.

    "To eyre," in falconry, is to build or rather to brood; hence we

  Falcons, for taking up, 20, 24, 187.

  ----, paid for, 9, 10, 92.

    These items afford much information on the value of falcons at the
    period. Two falcons and a goshawk cost 3_l._ Five falcons and a
    tarsell were worth 8_l._ and five falcons 7_l._ 6_s._ 8_d._; so
    that the value of a tarsell was about 13_s._ 4_d._

  ---- brought, 87, 184, 198.

  ---- to, for their coats, 142.

  ----, and hawks given by the King of France, for the expences of the,
      275, 279.

    Falcons and hawks appear to have been the most frequent, as well as
    most valued presents, from one prince to another. These accounts
    present two instances of the kind, the one of the payment of 23_l._
    6_s._ 8_d._ to the bearer of a cast of falcons from the Duke of
    Ferrara, and the other of a gift of several to Henry, from Francis
    the First, at Calais. Upon that occasion falconers seem also to
    have been transferred to Henry's service; for we find a payment
    of 2_l._ 2_s._ 8_d._ for their exences, (p. 275) whilst some idea
    may be formed of the number of birds given to Henry from the item
    of 2_l._ 18_s._ 10_d._ for the expences of them for one month
    only. "The best falconers were Flemings, and even those who have
    attended hawks in England, until a late period, were procured from
    a particular district of Flanders."--M.

    The only thing remarkable in this entry is, that such payments
    should be made out of the king's privy purse, or if that was the
    source of such disbursements that there should be so very few
    entries of the kind in as many years.--See PRISONER and TRAITOR.

  Feneux Lord, to the keeper of his house, 273.

    It is almost certain from this item that Henry lodged at Lord
    Feneux's house when at Canterbury. From the title of "Lord" being
    applied to him, it would appear that it was the house of Sir John
    Feneux, who was lord chief justice of England from 1496 to 1526.

    1558. All the entries respecting this nobleman refer to presents
    of dogs, &c. sent to the king, excepting one, when his servant had
    seized and brought up a traitor.

    The subject of "Fools" has been so ably discussed by Mr. Douce
    in his _Illustrations of Shakespeare_, that it is unnecessary
    to say more on it here than what the entries in these accounts
    suggest. The only names of Henry's fools which have reached us are,
    William Somers, Sexton, and Williams. Sexton is however the only
    one of them who is mentioned in these pages, unless the others
    were described under the names of "Great and Little Guilliam of
    the Privy Chamber," of whom there are numerous entries, though
    the honourable addition of "the King's Fool," never once occurs
    to their names. Those to whom that appellation is given are
    "Patch and Sexton," and the manner in which they are spoken of is
    strongly corroborative of Mr. Douce's opinion, that "Patch" was
    another designation for "a Fool." In one page (86,) we find "Patch
    the King's Fool" and Sexton both noticed. But this by no means
    contradicts the idea that they were names for the same individual.
    Sexton, Mr. Douce says, was presented to Henry by Cardinal Wolsey,
    and the anecdote related by Cavendish of his having given another
    Fool, who, it has been observed, was called Williams, to the king
    after his disgrace, and the poor wretch's attachment to his master
    is well known. It is manifest from these accounts that the Fool had
    a man to wait upon him; for we find John Emyson frequently noticed
    as "the man that waits or attends upon Sexton," "the keeper of the
    King's Fool," "Sexton's man," and in others, "Sexton's servant."
    All payments for the fool's food, travelling expences, &c., for
    it seems he accompanied Henry wherever he went, were made to his
    servant or keeper, whose wages were ij_d._ a day, (p. 45,) or about
    3_l._ per annum (p. 193,) and he was allowed, like the falconers
    and huntsmen, 22_s._ 6_d._ for his livery. Emyson appears however
    either to have died or to have been dismissed from his occupation
    before August 1532, for in that month, as well as in the October
    following, Green is described to have been Sexton's servant, but
    Skynner evidently attended him on his journey to Calais with Henry,
    in November in that year, and who is also mentioned as waiting upon
    him as early as September 1530, though Emyson was his keeper in
    December, 1529. It is remarkable that every entry relating to the
    Fool should be for his clothes, food, or other personal expences,
    and that he should never once have received a gratuity or "reward,"
    of which there are so many examples to others. It has been
    conjectured that the witty sallies of these degraded creatures were
    frequently rewarded by handsome presents, but no proof of the fact
    in relation to Sexton occurs. Besides Emyson we find "Thomas the
    Jester" sometimes mentioned, who seems to have been more fortunate
    than "the Fool," for he received 20_s._ on one occasion, and 22_s._
    6_d._ on another, "in reward;" whilst Henry gave the French king's
    jester at Calais the large sum of 9_l._ 6_s._ 8_d._ on the day
    the King of Navarre, the Cardinal of Lorrain, &c. dined with him.
    According to the ordinances of the Royal Household made at Eltham,
    in the 17th Henry VIII. the king's Fool was allowed one hackney.

    the editor's research.

  France King of, notices about his children, 59, _bis_.

    Francis the first, king of France, his wife and children, were
    taken prisoners by the emperor at the siege of Pavia in 1525. The
    queen and the children remained in his hands until 1529, when it
    was agreed by the treaty of Cambray that they should be delivered
    to Francis on the payment of two millions of crowns. The money was
    soon raised, and Hall gives us a circumstantial account of the
    execution of the treaty, from which it appears that the Spanish
    commissioners met the Great Master of France at Bayonne, in March
    1530, but the former objected to part of the coin on account of
    the weight, and therefore removed the children from Fountroby
    into Spain. The affair being thus delayed from March until June,
    Henry sent Sir Francis Bryan to pledge himself as security for the
    payment, and on the 1st of July queen Eleanor and the children were
    placed in the Great Master's hands. In July, Hall adds, "fyers were
    made in London and divers other places for the same consideracion
    and cause;" and it is worthy of remark, as a curious example of the
    change in the national policy, that precisely the same rejoicings
    took place when they fell into the emperor's power after the battle
    of Pavia a few years before. _Hall_, pp. 693, 772. From these
    accounts we learn that news of the event reached London on the 8th
    of July, 1530, by a Frenchman dispatched from the Great Master, and
    that on the 9th another messenger, probably from Sir Francis Bryan,
    arrived with similar information. Each of them received the same
    sum for their journey, namely, 23_l._ 6_s._ 8_d._

    "The materials of which the clothes of persons of rank were
    composed about this time consisted of velvet, satin, sarcenet, gold
    lace, and fur."--See Whitaker's _Craven_, 325. From the well known
    lines written on the marriage of Charles Brandon with the Queen
    Dowager of France,

    To Mary:

    Cloth of gold do not despise,
    To match thyself to cloth of _frise_.

    To Charles:

    Cloth of _frise_ be not too bold,
    Though, thou art match to cloth of gold.

    "we might presume that frieze rarely formed the dress of persons of
    rank, but Jamieson in voce (Supplement) quotes from an Inventory
    of 1539, 'Ane goone of _freis_ claith of gold.' In the following
    century frieze was more generally adopted. Fuller speaks of it as
    a coarse kind of cloth, manufactured in Wales, 'then which none
    warmer to be worn in winter, and the finest sort thereof very
    fashionable and gentile. Prince Henry had a frieze sute out of it,'
    &c. He adds, 'It will daily grow more into use, especially since
    the gentry of the land, being generally much impoverished, abate
    much of their gallantry.' _Worthies_, 553."--M.

    As in three out of the four instances in which this word is used it
    evidently referred to fantastic dresses or the appendages to them,
    it may be inferred that the children of the stable were ludicrously
    habited, and which is the more probable if the conjecture which has
    been hazarded be correct, that they were employed in riding racing
    horses. _Gere_ was, however, sometimes used for the ornamental
    parts of dress, for Louis XII. king of France, is described in
    a letter from the Earl of Worcester in 1514, as "devysing new
    collers and goodly _gere_ for" the queen his bride.--Ellis's
    _Original Letters_, second Series, vol. i. p. 236. Mr. Markland
    observes "this word, _per se_, meant clothing simply. From the days
    of Spenser to those of Swift, when magnificence or ornament is
    implied, the word is accompanied with some epithet; thus 'gorgeous
    gear' in the former, and 'glittering birth-day gear' in the latter.
    See _Masking_." Shakspeare, however, uses the word in the sense
    which it is supposed to be employed in the text:

    "Let us complain to them what fools were here
    Disguis'd like Muscovites, in shapeless _gear_."

    Chaucer uses _Gere_ for articles of any kind, but in one instance
    he applies it to articles of dress:

    "And for that nothing of her olde _gere_
    She shulde bring into his hous, he bad
    That woman should despoilen her right there
    Of which these ladies weren nothing glad
    To handle hire clothes wherin she was clad."

    These girdles were undoubtedly a splendid part of dress, and
    were in some cases proportionably expensive. Several notices of
    Girdles occur on the _Rolls of Parliament_, and in the _Testamenta
    Vetusta_. Among the expenses of Peter Martyr in 1547 was, "for
    riband for a gyrdel 1_s._ 2_d._" _Archaeologia_, vol. xxi. p. 472.

    By the Parliament which met in the 3 and 4 Edw. IV. 1463-4,
    Gloves were forbidden to be imported, _Rot. Parl._ vol. v. p.
    507, and which is the only notice of them in those records. In
    the bill of the expenses of Ochin and Martyr in 1547, Gloves are
    frequently mentioned; for "a Hatt and _Glovys_ for Bernardinus
    at Basell, 9_s._ 3_d._" "for a pair of furryd _Glovys_ for P.
    Marter, 13_s._" and at London, "for two payer of Glovys for them,

    Thus also used by Cavendish: "My lord continued at Southwell until
    the latter end of _grease-time_," p. 255. Probably grass-time, as
    both these notices refer to about the middle of June. We find in
    these accounts an entry of "taking the king's horses to _grysse_,"
    for grass.

  Gresham Richard, mercer of London, 7, 116, 261.

    Father of the celebrated Sir Thomas Gresham, the founder of the
    Royal Exchange, and, whom Mr. Lodge happily terms, "the great
    patriarch of commerce and of commercial finance." This Richard
    Gresham was a mercer in London, and, according to the same elegant
    writer, was "agent for the crown with the trading interest, or, as
    it was called, king's merchant, an office of the highest importance
    and trust, inasmuch as it united the duty of raising money for
    the royal occasions by private loans, with that of protecting
    and cherishing the sources from which they were derived." He was
    knighted, and became Mayor of London in 1537, and died in 1548. See
    also Ward's _Gresham Professors_.

  Greyhounds brought to the king, 19, 65, 70, 148, 161, 223, 236, 242,

  ---- Sir Edward, 87, 99, 184, 276, 279.

    Apparently the father-in-law of John, afterwards Duke of
    Northumberland. He was Marshal of Calais, Lord Warden of the Cinque
    Ports, and Master of the Ordnance, and married Eleanor, sister and
    co-heiress of Thomas West, Lord de La Warr, and who was probably
    the lady referred to in the next article.

  ----, Grand, of the Privy Chamber, 114, 130, 141, 210, 245.

    Of these two individuals little, or rather nothing is known, beyond
    the fact established by these accounts, namely, that they were
    entirely supported at the king's expence; hence it may be inferred
    that they were favourite servants, or "diverting vagabonds," to the
    king, perhaps a character a shade more respectable than his jester
    and fool. See, however some conjectures about the two Guilliams
    under FOOL, _ante_.

  Gun, a hand, brought, 104.

    "The name of _hand gun_ succeeded to that of hand-cannon, and
    when the lock was added, was superseded by that of arquebus." See
    Specimens of each kind in Skelton's _"Illustrations of Arms and

  Hardwareman, to the king's, 24, 31, 73, 81, 94, 218, 234, 267.

    Many of the articles which the "hardwareman" sold prove that the
    trade to which the word is now applied, differs materially from
    what it was at the period in question.

  Hare, paid for finding a, 157.

  Harvy Master, 162.

  Harvy Sir Nicholas, to the nurse and midwife of his child, 197.

    Ancestor of the Marquess of Bristol. He was gentleman of the privy
    chamber to the king, and one of his favorites. Sir Nicholas was
    thrice married and had issue by each wife; but it does not appear
    which child was honored by having the king for one of its sponsors.

  Hasilbone, to the keeper of, 161.

  Hasilrigg Robert, 92.

  Hastings and Rye, for a plat of, 91.

    As every entry relating to the fine arts is of peculiar interest,
    this is deserving attention; though from the word "plat" it would
    appear, that it was a plan rather than a painting. The sum paid for
    it to Vincent, the king's painter, was 3_l._ 10_s._ See PLAT.

      284, _bis_, 286, 288, 289.

    These numerous items of money for hawks' meat are more fully
    noticed at the commencement of the volume.

  ----, paid for taking up a, 256.

  Hawks brought from the King of France, 269;

    the expences of them, 275, 279.

  ---- to the Mew, 37.

    The Mew was a close place in which hawks were confined whilst
    moulting. "The Mews at Charing Cross were so called because Henry
    the Eighth used them for his hawks on those occasions."--M.

  Hawkyn, a falconer, 5, 31, 95, 140, 163, 181, 222, 236, 253, 287, 289.

  Hawte Christopher, a falconer, 198, 216, 236, 287.

  Hawys John, 47.

  Hayes Cornelius, Goldsmith, 10, 134, 138, 156, 170, 179, 184, 188,
      192.

  Hay, paid for, 17, 86, 189, 213.

  Healed, to the people that the king, 156, 160, 161, 163, 164, 170,
      203, 213, 217, 221, 225, 243, 249, 253, 264, 272, 278.

    These entries were of payments made to persons whom the king
    touched for the evil. It appears that they uniformly received
    7_s._ 6_d._ each; a gratuity which at that period, and to poor
    persons, was very considerable. It tends also in a great measure
    to account for the prevalence of the custom; for a more convenient
    superstition could scarcely be devised.

  Heath Cock, for a, 103.

  Hedge and a ditch, for making a, 194.

  Henawd [_i. e._ Henault] Park, to the keeper of, 170.

  Henley Park, keeper of, 63.

  Henchmen, for the rent of a house for the, 79, 125, 182, 209, 230,
      265.

    No word has been more commented upon than "Henchmen," or Henxmen.
    Without entering into the controversy it may be sufficient to
    state, that in the reign of Henry the Eighth it meant the pages of
    honor. They were the sons of gentlemen, and in public processions
    always walked near the monarch's horse: a correct idea may be
    formed of their appearance from the representation of them in one
    of the pictures in the meeting room of the Society of Antiquarians.
    It seems from these entries that they lodged in the house of
    Johnson, the master of the king's barge, and that the rent of it
    was 40_s._ per annum. Observations on the word will be found in
    Spelman's _Etymol:_, Pegge's _Curiala_, from the Liber Niger Edw.
    IV., Lodge's _Illustrations_, vol. i. p. 359, the _Northumberland
    Household Book_, Blount's _Glossary_.

  Henchmen, to the yeoman of the, 209.

  Hennage Sir Thomas, 8, _bis_, 25, 26, 29, _bis_, 43, _saepe_, 50, 58,
      66, 75, 79, 87, _bis_, 89, _bis_, 120, 141, 144, 148, 157, _bis_,
      165, 172, 187, 195, 196, 219, 249, 254, 255.

    One of the gentlemen of the privy chamber, and apparently the same
    individual, who was afterwards vice-chamberlain and chancellor
    of the duchy of Lancaster to Queen Elizabeth. His only child
    Elizabeth, who married Sir Moyle Finchard, was created Countess of
    Winchelsea, by Charles the First.

  Henyngham George, 88, 132, 209, 235.

    He was evidently attached in some way to the stables, as these
    items are of payments of money to him for horses, or provender for
    them.

  Hens, to the purveyor of, 109, 119, 129.

  ---- brought, 103, 178, 194.

  Hen taker, James Parker, the, 15, 25, 28, 33, 37, 41, 42, 56, 80, 92,
      142, 168, 199, 226, 258, 282, 285, 287.

    The hen taker and the Purveyor of Hens was probably the same
    person. His wages to which all these entries refer, were it seems
    9_l._ per annum.

  Herbs brought, 4, 36, 39, _bis_, 44, 45, _ter_, 50, 56, 57, 59, 72,

  Herytage Maister, 6, 40, 49.

    Query, if not intended for Sir Thomas Hennage just mentioned.

  Herons, for finding, 28.

  Hertford, 24.

  Hide, for a bare hide to cover the king's barge, 182.

  Hind a, brought, 189.

  "Hinging" over the gate, paid for the, 8.

  Hingings to a merchant, for hangings and other merchandize, 243.

    Apparently from the price, hangings of silk or rich stuff. A
    perfect idea of the richness and splendour of hangings at that
    period, may be formed from the description of those in the palaces
    of Henry the Eighth, in the Harleian MS. 1419, A. & B.; whilst
    of those used in the early part of the fifteenth century, a full
    account is given in the list of Henry the Fifth's effects on the
    Rolls of Parliament, vol. iv.

  Hobart James, 71, 80, 92, 109, 117, 141, 152, 172, 181, 193, 203,
      258, 279.

    It does not appear who this individual was, but as every entry
    relating to him is of a payment for bringing marmelade, dates,
    sweet oranges, lemons, and "other pleasures," it may be inferred
    that he was a kind of pastry-cook.

  Hobby, a dun, for meat for, 131.

  ----, for a, 119.

  Hobbies brought, 28, 104, 224.

  Hogsheads of wine, 98, 99.

  Holand John, 218.

  Hollys William, alderman of London, 170.

    Afterwards Sir William Hollis. His will is printed in the
    _Testamenta Vetusta_, whence it appears that he died in 1542. He
    was Lord Mayor of London in 1539.

      218.

  ----, to a Dompne, for riding two at once, 218. See DOMPNU.

  ----, paid for, 88, 128, 139, 180, 250, 257.

    "We cannot gather the _prices_ of Horses from these accounts
    as often as it is desirable. Gilbert Talbot, afterwards Earl
    of Shrewsbury, in 1578, offers 33_l._ for two Fryseland
    Horses."--Lodge's _Illustrations_, ii, 171. "There was particular
    attention paid in this reign, as appears by several laws, to
    promote the breed of large and strong horses. Mr. Barrington
    on Statutes (p. 499) conjectures that Tournaments and other
    magnificent Pageantries being in vogue in the early part of this
    reign might have prompted these measures. Certainly the strength
    of the Horses would contribute to render Tournaments more safe to
    those engaged in them as well as heighten the general effect of the
    scene." M.

    Notices of the value of Horses towards the end of the reign of
    Edward the First, will be found on the _Rolls of Parliament_, Vol.
    i. p. 228, 245; and in the _Liber Quotidianus Contrarotulatoris
    Garderolae_, of the 28th Edw. I. _sparsim._ but particularly p.
    77 _et seq._ They appear to have varied in price from one to ten
    pounds, and are minutely described both as to their colours and the
    purposes for which they were destined. Henry the Fifth's chariot
    horses, "Chivalx de Charrettz," were sold for 95_l._ 14_s._ 10_d._
    _Rot. Parl._ vol. iii. p. 237. By statute 11 Hen. VII. chap. xiii.
    it was prohibited to export Mares or Horses beyond the sea. We find
    from these payments that on one occasion 37_l._, and on another
    53_l._ were paid for horses; and that 7_l._ 10_s._ 3_l._ 6_s._
    8_d._ and 6_l._ 13_s._ 4_d._, were given at different times, for
    the purchase of a horse. In 1547 two of the horses which brought
    Bernardinus Ochin and Peter Martyr from Basell, were sold in
    Smithfield for 4_l._ 13_s._ 6_d._ _Archaeologia_, vol. xxi. p. 473.

      266.

  Howsell, for, 38, 40, 41.

    The only explanation given of "Housel" in the usual Dictionaries
    and Glossaries, "the Eucharist," could not possibly apply to
    either of the instances in which it is used in these accounts. It
    was evidently a payment made to the king's favourite minions, the
    Jester and the two Williamses, but the precise meaning of the word
    has not been ascertained.

  Hurlow Henry, 184.

  Hurt Sir John, 49, 50, _bis_, 115, _bis_, 209.

    From the appellation "Sir," being attributed, and the notice of a
    gown having been given to this individual, it would seem that he
    was a Priest; but this conjecture cannot be reconciled with his
    having been paid 22_s._ 6_d._ for his livery coat, nor, perhaps,
    with the frequent bets won by him at shooting. In one instance too
    "his fellowes" are spoken of. It is, however, certain, that he was
    one of Henry's numerous minions, in whose society he forgot the
    cares and dignity of a sovereign.

  Hussey Lord, his child christened, 117.

    John Lord Hussey of Sleford. He was beheaded in June, 1537, for
    being concerned in the insurrection in Lincolnshire. Lord Hussey
    left several children, one of whom appears to have been born in
    March, 1531, and to whom the king was very probably a sponsor.

  Jewell house, 64.

  ----, for the redemption of a, 88.

    This item admits of an inference which would establish a curious
    fact in the lives of Anne Boleyn and her sister Mary, namely, that
    the former had pawned a jewel to the latter, for the redemption of
    which 20_l._ was paid by the king's orders.

  Jewellery, for, 4, _bis_, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 16, 21, 82, 88, 90, 91,

  Imperial, money lost by the king at the game of, 265, 278.

    Of this game nothing is known, and perhaps these entries are the
    earliest, if not the only instances in which it is alluded to.

  Instruments brought to the king, 26, 210.

    Clearly musical instruments. Henry's attachment, and indeed
    proficiency in music, has been established by a note to Mr. Ellis's
    valuable _Original Letters_, Second Series, vol. i. p. 271,
    272, where an account of His Majesty's musical instruments from
    the Harl. MS, 1419, A. is printed, and which are satisfactorily
    explained by that eminent music master, Mr. Ayrton.

  ---- Anthony, 226, 229.

    Probably the individual whom Boswell, in his _Lives of the Knights

    was provost martial to the forces sent to quell the rebellion
    in Cornwall in 1547. See some remarks relative to the error in
    question in the _Testamenta Vetusta_, p. 693, and in Lodge's

    One of the Gentlemen of the Privy Chamber, and evidently a
    particular favourite of the King's.

  ---- William, 5, 40, 127, 206, 241, 261, 281.

    Probably the individual who is described in an inscription in
    Stepney Church as a Gentleman of the Privy Chamber, and as having
    married Avise, the widow of Nicholas Gibson. See _Weever's Funeral
    Monuments_, 4to, p. 309. He enjoyed an annuity from the king of
    20_l._

  Knight, Doctor, 118.

  Knives, for, 51, 174.

  ----, and sheathes of velvet, with girdles to them, 161.

  Knives, paid for girdles and a chape for, 168.

    Knives were worn at a very early period. In the 6 Edw. III. John
    Lord Grey of Rotherfeild, is stated to have been committed to
    prison for drawing his knife partly out of its sheath on William
    Lord Zouch, of Ashby. _Rot. Parl._ vol. ii. p. 656. _Long knives_,
    or other suspicious arms, were forbidden to be worn in the city of
    London or Westminster in 1351 during the sitting of Parliaments
    _Ibid._ p. 235.^{a} In 1363 the _knives_ of trades-people and
    artificers were prohibited from being adorned with gold or silver,
    or precious stones. _Ibid_, p 278,^{b} 281,^{b} and in the 3 Edw.
    IV. _knives_ were forbidden from being imported, _Ibid._ vol. 5,
    p. 507. Thomas Earl of Warwick, in 1400, speaks of _knives_ for
    the King's coronation in his will; and Chaucer's allusion to the
    Sheffield whittle is well known,

    "A Shefeld thwitel bare he in his hose."

    Among the expenses of Ochin and Martyr, in 1547, before cited, is a
    payment of 2_s._ 8_d._ for "two payer of _Tunbridge knives_." The
    knife was placed in the girdle.

  Larenno Cardinal de, 264.

  ----, money lost to him at dice and tennis, 268, _bis_.

  ----, to his singers, 269.

    The Cardinal of Lorrain. Tennis and dice seem almost as unsuitable
    to a Cardinal as a band of singers. On the 28th of October, 1532,
    when Henry ordered 9_l._ 6_s._ 8_d._ to be given to the French
    king's jester, and 4_l._ 13_s._ 4_d._ to the Cardinal's singers,
    Hall states that the king of Navarre, the Cardinal of Lorrain, and
    the Great Master and Admiral of France, dined with Henry at Calais;
    and these payments were evidently made for the amusement which they
    had afforded the party.

    Query, if not a mistake of the writer for mast and a line. See MAST.

  Laten, a desk garnished with, 123.

    Laten, or Latton, was, Mr. Todd informs us, a mixed kind of metal,
    made of copper and calamine, said by some to be the old orichalc.
    The meaning of the word has, however, puzzled our best antiquaries.
    Mr. Douce says it is always used for brass, whilst Dr. Meyrick
    thinks it was copper gilt. See some Observations on the subject in
    a Note to the _Archaeologia_, vol. xxi. pp. 261, 2. In the 3 Edw.
    IV. it was prohibited to import "Harneys for gurdels, of iron,
    of _laton_, of stele, of tyn, or of alkamyn." _Rot. Parl._ vol.
    v. p. 507,^{a} whilst in the 3 Hen. IV. Girdlers were prohibited
    from garnishing girdles with stones or metal "q' de _laton_,
    baterie, feer, et asser." _Ibid._ vol. iv. p. 73. In the 2 Hen.
    VI. the Commons complained that people had made "diverse workes
    of brauderie of unsuffisaunt stuff, and undwely wrought, as well
    upon velowet, and cloth of gold, as upon all other clothes of silk
    wrought with gold or silver of Cipre, and gold of Luk, or _Spanyssh
    laton_." _Ibid._ p. 255.^{a} On the Rolls of the 12 and 13 Edw.
    IV. we find "Basons _conterfete of Latyn_, and two other basons of
    _laten_" spoken of. _Ibid._ vol. vi. p. 37. Fabian, by his Will in
    1511, ordered that a stone of marble should be laid on his grave,
    "about the borders whereof I will be fastened a _plate_ of laton,
    within that plate graven thies words," &c. and Lady Mauley, in
    1438, bequeathed xx marks "for a marble stone with her portraiture
    thereon in copper or _latten_ gilt." In the agreement for the tomb
    of the Earl of Warwick in the 28 Hen. VI. it is covenanted that
    certain parts shall be made of the _finest latten_, and to be
    gilded, and which latten was to cost x_d._ per pound.--Dugdale's
    _Warwick_. It was used for crosses, candlesticks, plates for tombs,
    effigies, basons, &c. _Testamenta Vetusta_, pp. 148, 235, 261,
    268, 510, 511, 610, 713. From these extracts it is almost certain
    that Latten, or Laton, was neither iron, steel, tin, alkamain, or
    _baterie_, but the conjectures of Dr. Meyrick, Mr. Douce, and Mr.
    Todd, remain uncontradicted. The metal itself still exists on the
    tomb of the Earl of Warwick just mentioned, hence there are means
    of settling the question.

  Latimer Master, his expences in coming from and returning to
      Cambridge, 73.

  ----, for preaching before the king, 30.

    These entries are of much interest. The first has been before
    noticed under CAMBRIDGE, and it is only requisite, in illustration
    of the latter, to observe, that it is evident this distinguished
    martyr preached before Henry on the second Sunday in Lent, namely
    the 13th March, 1530, and was rewarded with 5_l._ a sufficient
    proof that the king was pleased with his doctrines. "His crosier is
    still preserved in St. John's College, Oxford."--M.

  Latronel, a jeweller, 270.

  Launder, that washes the children of the privy chamber, 75, 112.

    A Laundress.

  ----, to the, 165, 234.

    Some curious particulars relative to the King's Laundress occur in
    the _Ordinances of the Household_ in the 17 Hen. VIII. p. 215, who
    was, it appears, then called Ann Harris. Her wages were originally
    10_l._ per annum, but she obtained an addition of 6_l._ 13_s._
    4_d._ more on one occasion, and on another, 66_s._ so that she
    ultimately was paid 20_l._ per annum. She was bound to provide
    "as much sweet powder, sweet herbes, and other sweet thinges as
    shall be necessary to be occupied for the sweet keeping" of the
    articles entrusted to her; and it was expressly stated that she was
    to find wood and soap and every thing else out of her wages. Two
    "standard chests" were, however, delivered to her, "the one to keep
    the cleane stuff, and the other to keep the stuff that hath been
    occupied."

    1539, and died in 1544. His journey to Oxford in January, 1531,
    doubtlessly related to the king's divorce.

  Lee Lawrence, keeper of the Hounds, 81, 92, 95, 99, 106, 112, 115,
      125, 126, 134, 137, 139.

  Letters brought to the king, 26, 28, 235.

  ----, two packets of, paid for bringing from Venice, 92.

  Letter, one, brought in a purse by a monk, 239.

    This is a curious entry, and may be explained by considering that
    it was deemed the most respectful, and perhaps the safest, manner
    of conveying a letter.

  Lettuze, [Lettuce,] brought, 58, 169, 218, 220, 256.

  Lewers of crimson velvet, 159.

    Hawk's lewers; they appear to have cost 14_s._ each.

  Lewkenor Master, 26.

  Lewte, see LUTE.

  Lewys William, 37, 110.

  Library at Greenwich, 87.

    inventory in the Harleian MS. 1419, A. f. 62, three hundred and
    twenty-nine volumes.

  ---- of Sittingbourne, paid to the wife of the, 274.

    The woman who kept the inn with the sign of the Lion at
    Sittingbourne, at which Henry seems to have stopped on the 19th
    Nov. 1532, on his return to Greenwich from Calais.

  Lisle Lord, 112, 166, 271.

    It is very difficult to say who was the personage to whom this
    title is here attributed, but most probably Arthur Plantagenet,
    natural son of King Edward IV. though the patent creating him
    Viscount Lisle was not dated until the 26th April, 1533.

  Liveries, badges on, 16.

  ----, for, 8, 12, 15, 30, 31, 38, 39, 41, _bis_, 49, 53, 70, 71, 81,

  Locks, paid for, 111.

  ----, paid the smith that carries the locks about with the king, 238,
      244, 281.

    Like bolts, locks seem to have been carried for the king's chamber
    door by the smith of the household wherever His Majesty went.

  Longe, Master, 9, 162, 163, 275, 279.

    Sir Richard Long, Knt. An account of him will be found in Mr.
    Gage's _History and Antiquities of Hengrave_, p. 119, from which
    it appears that he was a Gentleman of the Privy Chamber, Master of
    the buckhounds and hawks, High Steward or Keeper of several of the
    royal demesnes, and Captain of Guernsey. He was seated at Shengay
    and Hardwicke in Cambridgeshire, and married Margaret, only child
    of John Donnington, of Stoke Newington in Middlesex, and widow of
    Sir Thomas Kytson of Hengrave, who died in 1540, by whom he had a
    son, Henry, born 31 March, 1544, afterwards knighted, and to whom
    King Henry VIII. and the Duke of Norfolk were sponsors, and three
    daughters. Sir Richard Long died in October, 1544, and an abstract
    of his will is given in that admirable work. His widow married
    to her third husband John Bourchier, Earl of Bath, and died 12
    January, 1561, aet. 52. Elizabeth, the daughter and heiress of Sir
    Henry Long, his son, married William Lord Russell, of Thornhaugh.

  Mantway, Marquess of, 280.

    Apparently Frederick II. Duke of Mantua, who died in 1540. He
    sent Henry a present of mares in December, 1532, and whose servant
    received 46_l._ 13_s._ 4_d._ "in reward" for bringing them.

  Mares brought, 280.

      261, 262, 264, 265, 281.

    This person, who, it is manifest, was wholly supported at the
    king's expense, and who, it may be consequently inferred, was
    one of his favourite minions, was the notorious Mark Smeton,
    a musician, who was accused of criminal familiarity with Anne
    Boleyn, and upon whose cowardly perjury, chiefly, that victim was
    condemned. The best account of him is that given by Cavendish:

    "My father a carpenter, and laboured with his hand
    With the swett of his face he purchast his lyvyng
    For small was his _rent_, much lesse was his land;
    My mother in a cottage used dayly spynnyng
    Loo in what mysery was my begynnyng
    Till that gentle prynce, kyng of this realme
    Toke me de stercore et origens pauperem

    And beyng but a boy clame upp the hygh stage
    That bred was of naught, and brought to felicite
    Knew not myself, waxt proud in my corage
    Dysdayned my father, and wold not him see,
    Wherfore nowe Fortune by hir mutabilitie
    Hathe made so cruelly hir power for to stretch
    For my presumption, to dye like a wretch."

    As his conduct was as dastardly as his birth was mean, he was put
    in irons when arrested, and afterwards hanged, whilst the other
    prisoners were beheaded.

  Marmalade brought, 109, 117, 172, 224.

  Marriages, paid to persons towards their, 17, 23, 27, 131, 134, 138,

  Marshal of the King's Hall, to the, 191.

  Mary Guylford, the king's ship, 18.

    This vessel was built in 1524, and was one hundred and forty
    tons burthen. In November, 1526, she was at Bourdeaux.--Ellis's
    _Original Letters_, Second Series, v. i. pp. 219, 220.

  Mary, Princess, the, 13, 55, 70, 98, 127, 146, _bis_, 148, 162, 183,
      202, _bis_, 221, 262, 281.

  ----, to a physician for attending her, 146, 202.

    Mary, the king's eldest daughter, afterwards queen of England. She
    was born on the 8th February, 1515, and was consequently about
    fifteen when she is first mentioned in these accounts. They chiefly
    refer to sums paid her for pocket money, which never exceeded
    20_l._ at one time, or was less than 10_l._ Upon one occasion
    10_l._ was given her to be distributed in charity. The only new
    facts connected with her life which they present are, that her
    royal Highness was ill in June or July, 1531, and apparently again
    in March, 1532.

  Masking, gere for, 270.

    Money paid for masquerade dresses when the king was at Calais in
    November, 1532.

  Mason Richard, 24.

  ----, John, the king's scholar at Paris, 8, 71, 119, 190, 263.

    Afterwards Sir John Mason, a Privy Councillor to Henry VIII. Edward
    VI. and Queen Elizabeth, and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.
    Having displayed much talent in Henry's presence, he was, at
    the suggestion of Sir Thomas More, sent to the university of
    Paris.--See _Biog. Britann._ _Art._ "Mason."

  Mass Books, for, 24.

  Massy, paid to him that appeched, [i. e. impeached,] 69.

    An entry of 10_s._ given to an informer.

  Mast and a line, for a, 55, 59, 96.

  ----, paid to the watermen for a, 140.

    A mast and ropes for the boat, but the different prices paid for
    them are curious; on one occasion 4_s._; on another 3_s._ 6_d._;
    and on a third only 1_s._ 8_d._

  Master, Great, to the, 59, 268.

    The first entry referred to Ann de Montmorency great master of the
    king of France's children, but whether the second related to him or
    to the Great Master of Henry's Household is not certain, but most
    probably to the latter.

  Mastiffs, the king's, 7.

  ----, given to the king, 36, 251.

  ---- collars and muzzles for, 186.

  Matches, money paid for two, lost by the king, 115.

  Matting a boat, for, 281.

  Mayling, cloths for, 159.

    Cloths for wrappers.

  Maynering Henry, 166.

    The person who made the king's arms.

  Meat, a present of, brought, 236, 255.

  Medicines for horses, 118, 263.

    The annual expense of "Medsons and drinks" for horses is calculated
    in the _Ordinances of the Household_, in the 17th Hen. VIII. at
    10_l._

  Medlars brought, 176, 274.

  Melons brought, 264.

  Mercer, to a, for his bill, 128, 144, 188, 189, 261, _bis_.

  Merchandizes, for certain, 243.

  Mew, money given when the Hawks went to the, 37. See HAWKS.

  Mewles, [i. e. Mules,] brought, 33.

  Michell, a Smith, 147.

  ---- ----, one of the king's guard, 269, 274.

  Midwife, paid to a, 22, 197.

    Probably money paid to a midwife when the king was Sponsor to the
    child.

  Mighen Peter, 18.

  Milan bonnets, for, 173, 208.

  Miles Thomas, 123.

  Milloner, to the, 33, 99, 129, 151, 164, 173, 174, 177, 185, 187,
      193, 199, 208, 213, 262.

    A milloner of the sixteenth, was evidently a different sort of
    tradesman from the milliner of the nineteenth century, for besides
    caps, bonnets, and gloves, he then sold knives, sheaths, girdles,
    jewels, &c.

  Mines, the king's at Lantrissen in Glamorganshire, money to be
      expended on, 69.

    That Henry interested himself in mining, is, the Editor presumes, a
    new fact in his character. From this item we learn that he worked
    a mine at Lantrissen in Wales, and ordered on one occasion that
    23_l._ 16_s._ 6_d._ should be expended on it; and on another he
    caused 40_s._ to be given to a miner. "All mines containing gold
    or silver were styled 'mines royal.' Of the latter the richest in
    Wales are in Cardiganshire. These were leased by James I. to Sir
    Hugh Middleton, and the profits enabled him to bring the New River
    from Ware to London; and by Charles I. to Mr. Bushel, who had
    been in the service of Sir Walter Raleigh; and from this source
    of wealth he raised and clothed a regiment for the king. The
    Cardiganshire mines, or perhaps its richest one, called Cwm Symlog,
    which yields 100 oz. of silver to the ton of lead, may be alluded
    to in the text."--M.

  Miner, to a, 43.

  Minstrells, to, 12, 14, 15, 28, 33, 55, 64, 70, 83, 128, 134, 170,
      190, 205, 252, 266.

    Numerous as the entries relating to minstrels are, no additional
    information is afforded to what is contained in Dr. Percy's
    elaborate essay, though they frequently corroborate the statements
    therein. The frequency of these payments tend, however, to
    establish Henry's attachment to music. In the _Ordinances of the
    Royal Household_ made at Eltham in the 17 Hen. VIII. we find that
    Hugh Woodhouse, the "Serjeant of the Mynstrills," had an annual fee
    of 10_l._ 16_s._ 10-1/2_d._

  Mistelden, [_i. e._ Misselden] Abbot of, 237.

      162, 165, 167, 171, 175, 176, 180, 181, 187, 194, 197, 205, 210,
      215, 222, 226, 229, 236, 241, 244, 246, 251, 265, 275, 281, 282.

  Myllain, [_i. e._ Milan,] Bonet, 24. See MILAN.

  Myllane, [Milan,] 54.

  Myllon, [_i. e_. melon,] a, given the king by an Italian, 248.

  Mynion, the King's ship, 18.

    In the list of Henry's navy, written on the 22nd October, 1525, and
    printed in Mr. Ellis's Second Series of _Original Letters_, vol. i.
    pp. 219, 220, the _Minion_ is described to be "off the tonnege of
    CLX tonne, and all newe." She was at Bourdeaux in November, 1526.


  Nags brought, 39, _bis_, 104, 224, 235, 267.

  Nelson John, 72.

  Nets, paid for mending the King's, 70.

  ----, paid for carrying the King's, 139, 177, 214, 257.

    Probably, Fishing Nets, which it seems were always carried with
    the king in his progresses; and hence it may be inferred that His
    Majesty was fond of the amusement.

  Nevill Sir John, 167, 267.

    Apparently the individual who served in the vanguard at the battle
    of Spurs. See Lodge's _Illustrations_, vol. i. p. 2.

  ---- Sir Edward, 272.

    Younger brother of George Nevill, Lord Abergaveny, and ancestor of
    the present Earl. Sir Edward was distinguished for his knightly
    accomplishments, and was for many years honoured with Henry's
    favour; but being suspected of a design to advance Reginald Pole to
    the crown, he was accused and tried, and beheaded at Tower Hill on
    the 9th November, 1538. Cavendish informs us that he was "a comely
    knight, of a goodly personage."

  Nevill, Master, to his son on his marriage, 277.

    Probably one of the sons of Sir Edward.

  New College, Oxford, to the children of, 244.

  Newelm, 156, 248, _bis_, 249.

  ---- Park, to the keeper of, 248.

  Newne ---- of Canterbury, 12.

  New Year's Gifts, 16, 101, 119.

  Nicholas, Friar, 23.

  Nicholas the astronomer, 130.

    The annual fee of the astronomer to Queen Elizabeth was 20_l._

  Nicholas Doctor, a physician, 192.

    He attended Wolsey in his last illness. See Cavendish, vol. i., p.
    311.

  Night-Caps, 23, 31, 218.

  Night-Gown, for Lady Ann Boleyn, 223.

    The minute way in which the materials for Lady Ann's night-gown are
    mentioned, cannot fail to excite a smile, even if it does not shock
    our modern ideas of delicacy. The whole expenses of it seem to have
    been 10_l._ 15_s._ 8_d._

  Nightingales brought, 235.

  Nods George, a huntsman, 68.

  Norfolk Duke of, 32, _bis_, 33, 41, 63, _bis_, 76, 107, 150, 156,
      158, 168, 169, _bis_, 180, 212, 250, 264, 267, 268, 283.

    Thomas Howard, third Duke of Norfolk, K. G. He was Lord Treasurer,
    to which office nearly all these entries relate.

  Norice, [_i. e._ Nurse,] to a, 22, 197.

  Norman, jeweller of Paris, 9.

  Norris Master, 30, 175, 224, _bis_, 275.

    Sir Henry Norris, gentleman of the Privy Chamber and Esquire of
    the body. His career is so well known that it is only necessary to
    remind the reader that he was suspected of a criminal intercourse
    with Ann Boleyn, and was consequently condemned and beheaded.

  Northampton, 71.

  ----, Mayor of, 160.

  Northern man, paid to a, 206, _bis_.

  Northumberland Earl of, 18, 109.

    Henry Algernon Percy, K. G: sixth Earl of Northumberland. He
    succeeded to that title in 1527, and was the individual who is
    supposed to have been attached to Ann Boleyn before her marriage.
    He was beheaded in 1553.

  Norton Wood, to the Keeper of, 161.

  Nott John, Groom of the Crossbows, 287.

  Nowell, the King's minstrel, 64, 83, 205, 266.

  Nuns of Canterbury, 22.

  Nurse, paid to a, 22, 197. See MIDWIFE.

  ---- to the Duke of Richmond's, 41.

  Nuts given the king, 160.

    As the Duke of Richmond was at this time twelve years old, it would
    seem that this gratuity was given to the woman who had nursed him
    in his infancy, rather than to the servant who had then the care of
    him.


  Oars paid for, 6, 7, 262.

    These entries shew the price of Oars, which it seems were sold for
    1_s._ 6_d._ each.

  ----, boat with sixteen, 45.

  Oats, paid for, 86, 189, 213.

  Odal Thomas, 136.

  Offering, paid for the King's, at Windsor, 140.

  ----, for the King's, to Our Lady of Walsingham, 214.

  ----, for the King's, to Our Lady of Boulogne, and to Our Lady in the

    quantity for his four servants. _Archaeologia_, vol. iii. p. 386.
    From the _Ordinances of the Household_ made in the 17 Hen. VIII. it

    This entry is of some interest, both as it shews the manner in
    which forts were inspected, and the expenses of three officers of
    government travelling to Portsmouth, and their charges there for
    ten days. The whole amounted but to 5_l._

    She married first William Viscount Beaumont, and died S. P. in

    As nearly all these entries respecting Painters are noticed by Mr.
    Horace Walpole in his _Anecdotes of Painting_, they afford no new
    information on the subject. The names of those who are mentioned
    are Vincent who painted a plat of Hastings and Rye, for which he
    was paid 3_l._ 10_s._; Bartholomew Penne, Anthony Toto, Andrew
    Oret, and Ambrose, the Queen of Navarre's painter. Of Vincent, Mr.
    Walpole gives no account; Ambrose, he conjectures to have stood in
    but little estimation, because the sum given him for a picture was
    only 4_l._ 13_s._ 4_d._ but of Penne and Tote we have the following
    particulars: "Penne or Penn is called by Vasari not Bartholomew but
    Luca Penni; he was brother of Gio Francesco Penni, a favourite
    and imitator of Raphael. He worked some time at Genoa and in other
    parts of Italy, whence he came into England, and painted several
    pieces for the king and some merchants here. Vertue concludes that
    some scriptural subjects which he found in a small room called
    the Confessionary, near the Chapel at Hampton Court, particularly
    the Passion, were by Penn. Vasari adds, that Luca Penni addicted
    himself latterly to making designs for Flemish engravers. Toto
    was afterwards Serjeant Painter, and Rymer (vol. xiv. p. 595.)
    gives his letters of Naturalization. Speaking of Ridolphi fils
    de Dominique Ghirlandaio, he says, 'Chez lui il y avait Toto del
    Nuntiato, qui depuis s'en alla en Angleterre, ou il fit plusieurs
    ouvrages de peinture et d'architecture, avec lequel Perrin fut
    amitie, et a l'envie l'un de l'autre s'efforcoit a bien faire.'
    But Toto's works are all lost or unknown; his fame, with that of
    his associates, being obscured by the lustre of Holbein." Painters
    formed part of the royal Household, for besides the entries in
    these accounts of money to Toto and Penn for their livery coats, in
    the _Ordinances for the Regulation_ of Queen Elizabeth's Household,
    "to the Serjeant Painter and other, to his appointment" is assigned
    a fee of 100_l._ per annum.

  Plat of Hastings and Rye, for a, 91.

    Clearly a plan of those towns, the word _plat_ occurs continually
    in a similar sense. Thus in the account in the Harleian MS. 1419,
    of furniture in Henry the Eighth's palaces, we find "a long case
    for _plattes_ covered with vellett," "a case of tynne with a plat."
    "Certeyne plattes and petygrees in a Cupborde," &c. but the best
    idea of a _plat_ is afforded by the plate in the second volume of
    Mr. Ellis's Second Series of _Original Letters_, which is called
    "A _Platt_ of Calais." In the MS. from whence it is taken is a
    "_Platt_ of the Lowe Countrye and Calleys, drawne in October,
    37 Henry VIII. by Thomas Pettut." As in the Harleian MS. 1419,
    the word, "Mappes and Pictures" occur, it is evident that a plat
    differed from both, though it would appear from the engraving
    alluded to, that it partook of the character of each. The price of
    the "Plat of Rye and Hastings," which was executed by Vincent the
    King's painter, was 3_l._ 10_s._

  Pope's ambassador, 9.

  ---- Julius' game, money lost at, 274, 275, _bis_, 276, 277.

    This game is mentioned in these accounts for the first time, hence
    no description can be given of it. All which can be inferred on the
    subject from these entries is, that it was played by four or more
    persons, and that it was not in use at Henry's court until the end
    of the year 1532. It is most probable that it derived its name from
    Pope Julius the Second, who died in 1513, and was possibly very
    similar to our present Pope Joan.

  Popingay, one offered the King, 277.

  Posset ale, for Sexton, 34.

    Archdeacon Nares says Posset was a drink composed of hot milk,
    curdled by some strong infusion, which was much in favour with our
    ancestors both as luxury and medicine. "Posset ale" was probably
    hot milk curdled by ale, but whether given to the Fool as a
    "luxury" or "medicine" does not appear, as it is included in the
    expenses of his washing, shoes, and "other necessaries."

  ----, paid for the christening of his child, 214.

  ---- Lady, 124, 135, 137, 232.

    It is manifest from most of these entries, that those individuals
    were especial favourites of Henry, who it seems acted as sponsor
    to their child, but the Editor has not been able to discover any
    particulars about them.

  Pount John, 135.

  Powell, a merchant, 167.

  Presents brought, 74, 93, 250.

  Prest, 83, &c.

    This word occurs continually in reference to money advanced to
    servants on their wages, and clearly meant money paid to persons
    before their salaries were due. In the _Shrewsbury Papers_ we find
    Lord Wharton informing the Earl of Shrewsbury in June, 1557, "The
    olde guarresone not paide for their half yeare, ended the xiiij
    of Febr. laste; and for this other half year which shall ende the
    xvjth day of Auguste, excepte money delivered _in preste_ by the
    layte Treasourer which will appear upon declaracion of his accompt.
    Hear is noo Treasurer knowne, nor when they shall be paide."
    To which the Editor has added the following note: "This term,
    derived from _pret_, French, _ready_, was always applied to money
    transactions, but had various acceptations. In military affairs
    prest or imprest money usually meant the gratuity by which recruits
    were retained, from whence the well known phrase, '_pressing_ into
    the service.' In this instance it signifies the sums issued from
    time to time by the treasurer for the current use of the army."
    Lodge's _Illustrations_, vol. i. p. 237. The sense, however, in
    which this word is used in these accounts is derived from the
    French _Prest_, a loan. Cavendish uses it in precisely the same
    way. Speaking of Wolsey's pecuniary necessities he says "it was
    concluded that he should have by the way of _prest_, a thousand
    marks out of Winchester Bishoprick," p. 239.

  Priest, paid to a sick, 77.

  ---- at Hounsdon, to the, 214.

  ----, money won of the King at the, 266, 267.

    Pricks were the points or marks in the centre of the Butts in
    archery.

    A game at cards, said by some writers to be one of the oldest known
    in England. See Nares' _Glossary_, where the manner of playing it

  Pykering Sir William, 220.

    The entry relating to this individual is not a little amusing,
    for it seems that he won 2_l._ 5_s._ of the King by a bet that
    he would outrun his own dog. He is thus described by Lloyd. "His
    extraction was not noble, his estate but mean; yet was his person
    so comely, his carriage so elegant, his life so gravely reserved
    and studious, and his embassies in France and Germany so well
    managed, that in King Edward's days he was by the council pitched
    upon as the oracle, whereby our agents were to be guided abroad;
    and in Queen Elizabeth's, designed by common vote for the prince
    by whom we were to be governed at home. He received extraordinary
    favours, no doubt, so deserving he was: he wished no more, he was
    so popular; and when his service was admitted to Her Majesty's
    bosom, all fancies but his own placed his person in her bed."
    _State Worthies_, Ed. 1766, vol. i. p. 415. Sir William died at
    Pickering House in London in 1574, aged 58, and was buried under
    a magnificent tomb in the Church of St. Helen the Great and Less.
    Queen Elizabeth, according to his epitaph, was, "principi ommum
    illustrassimae summus officris devotissimus." _Pennant's London_,
    p. 416. A copy of Edward the Sixth's "Instructions to Sir William
    Pickeringe, Knt. one of the Gentlemen of His Highenes Chamber
    toucheing the revocatione of Sir John Masone and the said Sir
    William to supplie his rome as residente ambassadore in Fraunce,
    dated 30th June, 1551," is preserved in the _Harleian_ MS. 353, f.
    113.^{b} If, as Pennant states, he was born in 1516, he could only
    have been sixteen years old when he ran a race with his dog, and
    thereby won a wager of 45_s._ from Henry, a time of life suitable
    to such an action; but it is singular he should have been knighted
    at so early a period.

  Quariars, for wax to make, 116.

    In the _Northumberland Household Book_ is an entry of "wax wrought
    in Torches," and of "wax wrought in _Quarions_," which Bishop Percy
    thus explains. "A Quarion was a square lump of wax with a wick in
    the centre. Round lumps of the same are still used in the Royal
    nursery under the name of Mortises." The word also occurs in the
    same sense in a MS. dated at Eltham, January, 22 Henry VIII. and
    noticed in the _Archaeologia_, vol. iii. p. 156. "An account was
    to be taken of all fuel, wine, &c. and wax lights, spent in the
    King's Privy Chamber, returning to the chaundry all the remains of
    mortars, torchers, _quarries_, prickets, and sizes."

  Quarterage [_i. e._ Quarter's wages] for the watermen's, 279.

  Quenay Vincent, [a Clockmaker,] 215.

  Queen the, 43, 183.

    An affecting proof of the little consideration in which the
    unfortunate Katherine was held is afforded by the fact, that
    during three years her name only twice occurs in the Privy Purse
    expenses of her royal husband, and then only in reference to two of
    her servants. Ann Boleyn is mentioned in almost every page, though
    she was then unmarried, and every buffoon and jester of the Court
    is frequently noticed, whilst the Queen of England is passed over
    in silence.

  Ratcliff Master, 200, 224, 268.

    Apparently Sir Humphrey Ratcliffe one of the Gentlemen Pensioners.
    Upon one occasion it seems the King lent him 100_l._ He is spoken
    of in Cavendish's _Life of Wolsey_, Ed. Singer, 1815, vol. i. pp.

    A stringed instrument resembling a fiddle. The price of a Rebeck in
    1531, appears to have been xx _s._

  ---- Marshal of the King's hall, 79, 125.

  Reed, for the King's barge, 45.

    Reed was probably used in cleaning the bottom of the barge. On such
    occasions it is affixed to a pole, set on fire, and applied to melt
    the mixture of pitch, &c. with which the bottom of an uncoppered
    vessel is covered.

  Redemption of a jewel, for the, 88.

    This curious entry is noticed under JEWELL and ROCHFORD.

  Reding William, a mercer, 215.

  Relick Water brought, 67, 148.

    What _Relick Water_ was cannot be exactly explained. On one
    occasion it was sent by the Abbot of Westminster, whose servant
    received 20_s._ for bringing it; and on the other, a glass of it
    was brought from Windsor to Hampton Court, the bearer of which was
    paid only 12_d._ It was probably a strong scented spirit, and from
    its name we may infer that its virtues were of a superior nature,
    even if they were not supposed to have been derived from some
    sacred object or ceremony.

  Remnant of a piece of cloth of gold, 190.

  ----, Duke of, 40, 41, 42, 131, 189.

    Henry Fitz Roy, natural son of King Henry VIII. by Lady Elizabeth
    Talboys. He was born in 1519, and on the 18th June 1525, was
    created Earl of Nottingham, and Duke of Richmond and Somerset, K.
    G.; on the 26th of July following he was constituted Lord High
    Admiral. He married Mary, daughter of Thomas, Duke of Norfolk, but
    died before consummation on the 24th July, 1536. When the Duke is
    first mentioned in these accounts, he was eleven years of age:
    arrows were then purchased for him, and his nurse is said to have
    received 40_s._ in reward. In the same year 20_s._ were paid for a
    lute for him; and it appears that in January 1532 he was ill, for a
    physician was paid 40_s._ for visiting him.

  Rights, paid to Mark and the two Guilliams against Easter for to take
      their, 121.

    Upon this item the Editor is unable to throw any light. If it means
    a payment of their accustomed gratuity of 20_s._ each, at Easter,
    it would be intelligible, and it is difficult to explain it in
    any other way; for that money should be paid to an individual for
    receiving what was his "Right," seems almost absurd.

  Rightwise, Master of St. Paul's school, 106.

    The King ordered 13_l._ 9_s._ to be given to this person in January
    1531, but for what reason does not appear.

      _ter_, 210, _bis_, 226, 232, 263, _bis_.

    George Boleyn Viscount Rochford, the brother of Queen Ann Boleyn.
    The history of this amiable young nobleman is too well known to
    require any further notice of him in this place. Almost all these
    entries shew the high favour in which he was held by Henry, for it
    is manifest from them that he was the King's constant companion,
    and was always one of his parties, at shooting matches, bowls,
    dice, cards, and indeed at every other species of amusement.

  Rochford, Lady Mary, 88.

    Apparently the sister of Lord Rochford and Queen Ann Boleyn, though
    it is extraordinary that she should be called Lady Mary _Rochford_.
    She married first Sir William Carey, by whom she had Henry Lord
    Hunsdon, and secondly, Sir William Stafford, Knight. The entry
    relating to her is not a little curious; it appears from it that
    her sister Anne Boleyn had pawned a jewel to her for the sum of
    20_l._ which was redeemed out of the Privy Purse expences by order
    of the King.

  ---- Lady Ann, 108, 111, 113, 123, 133, 215.

    It seems that all these entries referred to Ann Boleyn, and ought
    to have been inserted under her name. They are, however, alluded to
    at the commencement of the volume.

  Rotherham Master, 71.

  Rounds, for making of, 107, 145.

    A kind of Target at which arrows were shot, both for practice and
    amusement. Cavendish says, that when he was sent for by Henry to
    Hampton Court, after the death of Cardinal Wolsey, "I found him
    shooting _at the rounds_ in the park on the backside of the garden,
    and perceiving him occupied in shooting, thought it not my duty to
    trouble him, but leaned to a tree intending to stand there, and to
    attend his gracious pleasure. Being in a great study, at the last
    the King came suddenly behind me where I stood, and clapped his
    hand upon my shoulder, and when I perceived him, I fell upon my
    knee. To whom he said calling me by name, 'I will,' quoth he, 'make
    an end of my game, and then I will talk with you,' and so departed
    to his mark, whereat the game was ended. Then the king delivered
    his bow unto the yeoman of his bows and went his way inward to the
    palace." _Ed. Singer_, 1815, vol. i. p. 328.

  ----, money won at the, 134.

  Rowed, to the men that rowed the king, 127, _bis_.

  Rowland ----, a keeper of Waltham Forest, 72.

  Rowme, to Rutter, for his fee due for his rowme in Windsor Forest,
      286.

    Rowme appears to have been a common expression for "place," or
    "situation," thus in Lodge's _Illustrations_, in a letter dated
    28th April, 1516, "The Master of the Rolles is departed, and Doctor
    Tunstalle hath his _rowme_, as the saying is." Vol. i. p. 9. The
    fee in question was due to him by virtue of office, which was that
    of keeper of Windsor Forest.

  Russell, Sir John, 18, 85, 118, 241.

    Ancestor of the Dukes of Bedford, and founder of the honors of that
    illustrious family. He was created Baron Russell of Cheymes, on the
    9th March 1538, was a Knight of the Garter, Lord Admiral, and Lord
    Privy Seal, and in 1549, was raised to the Earldom of Bedford.

  Russell Lady, 107, 245.

    Wife of Sir John Russell just mentioned. She was the daughter and
    co-heiress of Sir Guy Sapcotes, Knight, and widow of Sir John
    Broughton, of Teddington, in the county of Bedford.

    Rye was at that time a sea-port of some importance, and maintained
    several ships of war. In Lodge's _Illustrations_, vol. i. p. 63,
    is a letter from the Privy Council, dated in 1544, in which the
    following passage occurs: "The town of Rye hath all this year had
    iij or iiij vessells abrode for the warres, and gayned very moche
    by it."

  Sail, for a, 262.

  Sakar a, brought, 91.

  ---- and Sakeretts, paid for, 192.

    "A _Saker_ is a passenger or peregrine Hawk, for her eyrie hath not
    been found by any. She is somewhat larger than the haggard falcon,
    her plume is rusty and ragged, the sear of her foot and beak like
    the lanner; her pounces are short; however she has great strength,
    and is hardy to all kind of fowl."--_Gentleman's Recreation._
    A _Sakerett_ was probably a young Saker. Six Sakers and five
    Sakeretts cost, in 1532, eight crowns a-piece, the sum paid for the
    eleven being 20_l._ 10_s._ 8_d._

  ----, for the Exhibitions of, at Paris, 8, 71, 90, 190, 263.

  Scholars, to Mr. Ratcliffe, a scholar at Cambridge, 224.

    Among the few redeeming traits in Henry the Eighth's character,
    was a love of learning, to which each of these entries bears
    additional testimony. Besides occasional gifts to Scholars of
    Oxford, Cambridge and Paris, and which in three years amounted to
    83_l._ 13_s._ 4_d._ he also gave exhibitions, the whole expences
    of which in the same period were 63_l._ 6_s._ 8_d._ He moreover
    supported two scholars at St. Paul's School, the charges for
    which were 30_l._ 3_s._; making, if 13_l._ 9_d._ paid to the
    master of that school in January 1531, be included, a total of
    190_l._ 12_s._ spent from November 1529 to December 1532, for the
    encouragement and advancement of erudition; a trifling sum, it is
    true, when compared with recent instances of Royal munificence, but
    important when the value of money, and the manners of the times are
    considered.

  Science, paid to a jeweller to be employed in his, 156.

    The use of the word _Science_ in this sense is rather curious.

    Apparently a gift of 20_s._ 4_d._ to pay the fee of affixing the
    great seal to some instrument affecting her interests.

  Secretary Master, 26, 77, 144.

    Probably the Principal Secretary of State, but it is not certain
    who filled that office, in 1530 and 1531. Cromwell was not
    regularly appointed to it until 1534; but it is most likely that he
    was the person so designated in these accounts.

  Sergeant of the Cellar, 64. See CELLAR.

  ----, Porter, 256.

    Apparently Edmund Knyvett, who certainly held that office in August
    1519. See _Testamenta Vetusta_, p. 568.

  ---- Apothecary, 146.

  Servants, [_i. e._ Falconers, Huntsmen, &c.] wages and expences of,

  Seymour Sir Edward, 5, 17, 36.

    Afterwards the King's brother-in-law, and Duke of Somerset, the
    celebrated Protector of England. These entries show the familiar
    manner in which he was treated by Henry as early as 1529. The first
    item is of a payment to him of 337_l._ upon a reckoning between His
    Majesty and himself, and the second and third to money lost to him
    by the King at play. On one occasion Sir Edward won of Henry the
    large sum of 376_l._ 10_s._

  Seymour, Robert, 273.

    It has not been ascertained who this individual was. The entry
    relating to him is a payment of 4_l._ 13_s._ 4_d._ which he had won
    of the King at Tables.

  Shafts for, 47, 265.

  Shalms, brought to the king, 26.

  ---- for Tenor and Treble, 86.

    A Shalm is explained by Mr. Ayrton, whose professional reputation
    renders him excellent authority on such a subject, "to be the base
    Cornet." Ellis's _Original Letters_, Second series, vol. i. p. 273.
    Bishop Percy informs us that "it was a wind instrument like a pipe,
    with a swelling protuberance in the middle:"

    "Item, my Lord useth and accustometh yearly when his Lordship is
    at home to gyf to iij of the Kyngs _Shames_ when they come to my
    Lord yerly x s." _Northumberland Household Book_, p. 341. Cavendish
    says, when the king of France came, "he danced, and others with
    him, the most part of that night; my Lord's minstrels played there
    so excellently all that night, that the _shalme_ (whether it were
    with extreme labour of blowing, or with poisoning, as some judged,
    because they were more commended and accepted with the king than
    his own, I cannot tell,) but he that played upon the _shalme_, an
    excellent man in that art, died within a day or twain after." Ed.
    Singer, 1825, vol. i. p. 114. Perhaps the earliest drawing of a
    Shalm extant, is in the Illustrations to the copy of Froissart, in
    the British Museum, Royal MS. 18 E. I & II.

    Henry's attachment to naval affairs has been fully established, and
    he consequently paid great attention to his ships. A curious list
    of his Majesty's navy, in 1525, 6, is given by Mr. Ellis, in his
    _Original Letters_, second Series, v. i. p. 218 et seq. as a note
    to a very interesting letter on the subject from Sir Edward Howard,
    Lord High Admiral, in 1513. See also a letter from some ladies to
    the King from Portsmouth about the year 1540, acquainting the King
    with the pleasure they derived from inspecting "the Great Harry."
    _Ibid._ _First Series_, vol. ii. p. 126.

  ----, the Master Treasurer's, 6.

    Evidently the ship belonging to Sir William Fitz-William,
    afterwards Earl of Southampton, and which by his will dated in
    September, 1542, he thus bequeathed to the King--"Item, I give
    to the King's Majesty my _great ship_, with all her tackle,
    and my collar of the garter, with my best George beset with
    diamonds."--_Testamenta Vetusta_, p. 707. Individuals frequently
    owned ships which were employed in the King's service, and which
    seem to have been considered as a sufficient means of support, for
    Sir Edward Howard, the Lord Admiral, in his will dated in 1512,
    says, "Whereas I have two Bastards, I give the King's grace the
    choice of them, beseeching his Grace to be good Lord to them, and
    that when he cometh of age he may be his servant; and him that the
    King's Grace chuseth, I bequeath him my bark, called 'Genett,' with
    all apparel and artillery, and L _li_ to begin his stock with: the
    other I bequeath to my special trusty friend, Charles Brandon,
    praying him to be good master unto him; and for _because he hath no
    ship_, I bequeath to him C marks to set him forward in the world."

    All these entries refer either to money paid to individuals, as a

    Archdeacon Nares explains Shovel-board to be "a common trivial
    game, which consisted in pushing or shaking pieces of money on a
    board to reach certain marks. Shovel-board play is graphically
    described in a poem entitled _Mensa Lubrica_, &c. written both in
    Latin and English by Thomas Master. The English Poem is cited at
    large in Bliss's edition of _Anth. Wood_, vol. iii. p. 84. The
    table had lines or divisions marked with figures, according to
    the value of which the player counted his game. It is minutely
    described by Strutt, _Sports and Pastimes_, p. 267, as still in
    use in pot houses, and played with a smooth halfpenny. The game
    was also called Shove-groat, Shove-board, and Shuffle-board."

    People supposed to be healed by the King's touch from the disease,
    thence called the King's Evil. "Andrew Borde, who wrote his
    _Introduction to Knowledge_, in king's reign, states, that 'the
    Kinges of England, by the power that God hath gyven to them, doth
    make sicke men whole of a syckness called the Kynges evyll.' This
    extract and the entry above are sufficient to prove, were other
    evidence wanting, that Dr. Percy was much mistaken in supposing
    that 'this miraculous gift was left to be claimed by the Stuarts."
    Some curious matter upon this subject is collected in a note by
    Nichols, _Literary Anecdotes_, 195, II. 504, Reed, Shak. X. 243,
    and see 195. Amongst the Conway papers (MSS) there is an order
    for a proclamation, dated 13th May, 1625, to forbid the repair
    of people to court till Michaelmas following, to be healed of the
    King's Evil, and that for the future all shall bring certificates
    from the minister, &c. of the parish, for that many being healed,
    have disposed of their pieces of gold otherwise than was intended,
    _and thereby fall into relapse_.' Sir Kenelm Digby informed Mons.
    Moncenys, that if the person cured lost the piece of gold, the
    complaint immediately returned. Moncenys' _Travels_, t. ii. p. 20.

  Smythe Thomas, 170, 183, 219, _bis_, 238, 259, 261, 265, 269.

    For the following Note relative to this individual, the Editor is
    indebted to Joseph Gwilt, Esq. F.S.A. a descendant of his family:

    "Thomas Smith, whose name so frequently occurs in these accounts,
    was most probably afterwards of Campden, Co. Gloucester; he had
    also a grant of the manor of Lyersocle, Co. Heref. jointly with his
    son-in-law, Hugh Walshe, which was confirmed in the 35th of the
    same king. That Smythe was a man of considerable importance, may
    be inferred as well from his matrimonial alliances, as from the
    inscription on his monument, in which he is described, '_a pueritia
    sua aulicus_.' In the College of Arms there is a grant to Thomas
    Smith, by Christopher Barker, dated Boulogne 1544, and afterwards
    confirmed by Gilbert Dethick, from which it appears that he was
    at Boulogne in that year; probably attendant on the court there.
    Elizabeth, the first wife of Thomas Smith, was daughter and coheir
    of Eustace Fitzherbert, and relict of Edward Smith, of Cresing
    Temple, Co. Essex, by whom she had two children. By Thomas Smith it
    is not clear from the pedigrees, which exhibit some discrepances,
    that she had issue. His second wife was Katharine, daughter of
    Sir George Throckmorton, of Coughton, relict of Robert Winter, of
    Hoddington; Co. Wigorn, by whom he had a numerous family. He was
    Sheriff of Gloucestershire in the years 1571 and 1593 and died
    1593. Over the place of his interment near the altar of Campden
    Church, on the north side, is a canopied monument of the time
    with his figure in knight's armour of the size of life. On the
    compartments between the pedestals under the columns are bassi
    relievi, representing his two wives, seven sons and six daughters.
    On the western face of the monument, are the arms of Smith, viz.
    a Fess between three Saltires; and in another escotcheon, the
    Crest, viz. two Amphibamies indorsant. On the south side are three
    escotcheons, the westernmost with the arms of Smith. The next
    towards the altar, Smith impaling Throckmorton; and Olney, Spyne
    and Bosson, quarterly. The last, Smith's impaling Fitzherbert in
    the first and fourth, and two other coats quarterly. Against the
    north wall of the chancel is the following inscription:--'Hic
    jacet vir verus Christianus Thomas Smith Armiger quondam Manerii
    di Campden Dominus, a pueritia sua aulicus, qui suo tempore fuit
    e consiliis Regis Marchiae Walliae bisque Vicecomes comitatus
    Gloucestriae, ac justiciarius pacis ejusdem comitatus usque ad
    extremum aetatis, qui habuit duas uxores; primam Elizabetham Filiam
    et haeredem Eustatii Fitzherbert Armigeri, secundam Katharinam
    filiam Georgii Throckmorton Militis cum filiis et filiabus ut hic
    patet qui obit die ... Anno Dom. MDXCIII.'

    There is little, doubt that this Thomas Smith was the father
    of Henry Smith, Esq. an Alderman of London, who is buried at
    Wandsworth, and whose extensive charitable benefactions in Surrey
    and elsewhere are universally known. He bore the same arms with a
    difference, as appears by the funeral certificate, in the College
    of Arms, Register i. 23. 30, and there are many other circumstances
    which tend to strengthen such a conjecture."

    It appears from the _Book of Quarterly Payments_ from the 29th to
    the 33rd Henry VIII. in the library of the Royal Society, that
    Smith was a Page of the Chamber, and received 10_l._ _per annum_
    for his wages; and it is manifest from these entries that like
    Smeton and the two Williamses, he was a peculiar favourite of
    Henry, for all his apparel was paid for out of the privy purse, and
    he accompanied the King to Calais in October 1532.

    Apparently Sir William Spencer of Althorp, ancestor of the Duke

    the 23rd and 24th Henry VIII. was Sheriff of Northamptonshire. Sir
    William died, however, on the 22nd June 1532, a month before his
    servant is said to have brought a present to the King. His son and
    heir was then very young, hence these gifts were probably sent by
    his mother or guardians.

    the annual celebration of St. George's feast. No notice on the

  ---- Horse, 162, 194.

  ---- Ox the, brought, 112.

    A Stalking Horse, Archdeacon Nares informs us, was "sometimes a
    real horse, sometimes the figure of one cut out and carried by the
    sportsman for the following purposes. On being found that wild
    fowl which would take early alarm at the appearance of man, would
    remain quiet when they saw only a horse approaching, advantage was
    taken of it, for the shooter to conceal himself behind a real or
    artificial horse, and thus to get within shot of his game." In the
    _Gentleman's Recreation_ both kinds of stalking horses, and the
    manner of using them, are fully explained. All these entries on
    the subject seem to refer to a real horse, and we learn from one
    of them that an ox was employed for the same purpose. A _stalking
    horse_ occurs in the list of Henry's horses in the _Ordinances made
    at Eltham_, in the 17th Henry VIII. p. 200.

  Standards, for carrying Plate, 43.

    The word is used in a similar sense by Cavendish. "The King caused
    to be sent him three or four cart loads of stuff, and most part
    thereof was locked in great _standards_ (except bed and kitchen
    stuff) wherein was both plate, and rich hangings, and chapel
    stuff." Ed. _Singer_, 1825, vol. i. p. 224.

  Strene the, brought, 151.

    This entry almost defies explanation. The only instance in which
    _strene_ occurs in the Glossaries is synonymously with _strain_, a
    race, descent, lineage. Hence it might, however unlikely, mean a
    pedigree; but it is more probable that it was kind of _strainer_.

  Sydney Sir William, 29.

    Apparently Sir William Sydney, grandfather of Robert, Earl of
    Leicester, a Gentleman of the Privy Chamber. His wife, who was
    probably the Lady Sydney here mentioned, was Ann, daughter of Hugh
    Pagenham, Esq.

    _Tables_ is considered to be the old name for back-gammon. In
    the frontispiece of Strutt's _Sports and Pastimes_ an engraving
    of a _Table_ occurs. Sir William Compton, by his will dated in
    1523, bequeathed to Henry "a little chest of ivory, wherof one
    lock is gilt, with a chess-board under the same, and a pair of
    _tables_ upon it, and all such jewels and treasures as are inclosed
    therein." _Testamenta Vetusta_, p. 593. Tables are thus spoken of
    in a _Knight's Instructions to his Daughters_, originally written
    in French, in April 1371, and translated about the reign of Henry
    VI. "Ther was a gentille knight's daughter that wratthed atte the
    _Tables_ with a gentill man that was riotous and comberous and hadd
    an evelle hede, and the debate was on a point that he plaide that
    she saide it was wronge, and so the wordes and the debate rose so,
    that she saide that he was a lewde fole and thanne lost the game in
    chiding." _Harleian_ MSS. 1764, f. 7^{b}

    Numerous as these entries are, they afford no information on the
    situation which Talbot filled. His wages were 9_l._ per annum, and
    we may infer that he was one of the servants.

    Mr. Ellis states that this individual was Treasurer of the Chamber,
    and was appointed Secretary to the King for the French tongue, with
    a salary of 100 marks, in 1523. He purchased the manor of Layer
    Marney in Essex in 1525, and was Sheriff of that county in 1533. He
    died on the 26th October, 1545, and was buried at St. Margaret's,
    Walbrooke. _Original Letters_, First Series, vol. i, p. 283. Mr.
    Ellis has printed some, and referred to several of his letters.
    Collins says, Tuke was Secretary to Cardinal Wolsey, _Peerage_, Ed.
    1779, vol. i. p. 87. The entries respecting him in these accounts
    only refer to the months of January and February, 1530, and relate
    to payments of large sums to the Emperor, or for other purposes.
    The whole amount paid into his hands on those occasions was
    5143_l._ 8_s._

  Tewksbury Abbot of, 149.

  Thirlby Doctor, 262.

    Afterwards the first and only Bishop of Westminster. Mr. Lodge says
    of him in a note to a letter in his _Illustrations_, that he was
    an able civilian, and was employed in several embassies by Henry.
    He was translated to Norwich by Edward VI. and to Ely by Mary, and
    died at Lambeth, 26th August, 1570. That elegant writer farther
    observes, "The mildness of his conduct during the persecutions
    of the Protestants by Mary, secured him a quiet retreat in the
    following reign. In making a grave for the burial of Archbishop
    Cornwallis, at Lambeth, in 1783, the body of Bishop Thirlby was
    discovered in its coffin, in a great measure undecayed, as was the
    cloathing. The corpse had a cap on its head, and a hat under its
    arm."

  Tierces of wine, for the lading of, 99.

  Tissue, pieces of, paid for, 6, 105.

  Token a, sent from the King to Sir Francis Bryan, 125.

    The word _token_, per se, evidently meant any thing sent as a
    mark of kindness. In this instance it was 50_l._ but it was more
    frequently a jewel or other article of value. Thus in the instance
    of Cardinal Wolsey, when Henry was informed by Dr. Butts that
    unless he sent him some testimony of his favour he would die
    within four days, "Even so will I, quoth the King, and therefore
    make speed to him again, and ye shall deliver him from me this
    ring for a _token_ of our good will and favour towards him, in the
    which ring was engraved the King's visage within a ruby, as lively
    counterfeit as was possible to be devised."--"And then he spake
    to Mistress Anne [Boleyn] saying, 'Good sweetheart, I pray you at
    this my instance, as ye love us, to send the Cardinal a _token_
    with comfortable words, and in so doing ye shall do us a loving
    pleasure.' Incontinent, she took her tablet of gold hanging at her
    girdle, and delivered it to Master Buttes with very gentle and
    comfortable words," &c. Cavendish's _Life of Wolsey_, Ed. Singer,
    1825, vol. i. p. 226. An engraving of this scene is given from a
    MS. in the possession of Mr. Douce in that interesting work.

  Totehill, 107, 118, 120.

  Tomb, paid for the King's, 101.

    This entry is rather extraordinary, because Henry VIII. expressly
    states in his will, dated on the 30th December, 1546, sixteen
    years afterwards, that his tomb was not then made. He orders that
    his body shall be buried in the choir of his College of Windsor,
    "mid-may between the Halls and the High Altar, and an honourable
    tomb for our bones to rest in be made, if it be not done by us in
    our life-time." But it is evident from the item in question that
    a tomb was began for him as early as December, 1530, towards the
    expences of which Cromwell was then paid 13_l._ 6_s._ 8_d._

      272.

    Until the 26 Henry VIII. 1532, Thomas Boleyn, Earl of Wiltshire,
    father of Queen Anne, is said to have been Treasurer of the
    Household; in which year Sir William Fitz-William, afterwards
    Earl of Southampton, was appointed to that office; but in
    the will of Sir David, Knt. dated in February, 1529-30, he
    speaks of "Sir William Fitz-William, Treasurer of the King's
    Household."--_Testamenta Vetusta_, p. 701; and there are other
    causes for believing that he was Treasurer of the Household at the
    whole period embraced by these accounts.

  Viols, to three of the, 260.

    A payment of 3_l._ 7_s._ 6_d._ to three persons who played on
    the viols. Mr. Ayrton observes, "A chest of viols was a set of
    instruments comprising a treble, a tenor, and bass viol, or what we
    now denominate a violin, viola, and violoncello." Ellis's _Original
    Letters_, Second Series, vol. i. p. 272.

  Virginals, for, 37, _ter_, 110.

    A Virginal is thus explained by Mr. Ayrton. "The Virginal was that
    which afterwards took the name of Spinnet, and differed from it
    only in shape. The Spinnet was triangular, the Virginal oblong,
    like our small piano fortes." Ellis's _Original Letters_, Second
    Series, vol. i. p. 272. The item in p. 37, describes the different
    kinds of Virginals with their respective prices; two pair in a box
    with four stops, cost 3_l._; two pair in one coffer cost 3_l._, and
    a little pair, 20_s._ For five pairs, on another occasion, 8_l._
    6_s._ 8_d._ were paid.

  Upshot, for one upshotte that he wanne from the King, 143.

    In the sense in which _Upshot_ is there used, it seems to mean a
    wager or rather stake, or sum played for.

  ----, a curious, won, 263.

  Waits of Canterbury, to the, 266, 274.

    This is perhaps the earliest instance known of the use of the word,
    in the sense of nocturnal musicians, as Archdeacon Nares, does not
    cite any older authority than Beaumont and Fletcher. They appear
    to have played to the King whilst at Canterbury, on his route to
    Dover on the 9th October, and on his return the 18th of November
    1532. Among the entries in the Household expenses of Thomas Kytson,
    Esq. in January 1574, is "In reward to Richard Reede, one of the
    _wayghtes_ of Cambridge, for his attendance in Christmas time
    xxs."--_History and Antiquities of Hengrave_, p. 201.

  Walshe Master, 4, 16, _bis_, 53, 108, 146, 232.

    Apparently Sir Walter Walshe, Knight, a Gentleman of the Privy
    Chamber, who was sent to the Earl of Northumberland's house to
    arrest Cardinal Wolsey. See _Singer's Edition of Cavendish_, 1825,
    vol. 1, pp. 272, 275, _et seq._

  Walshe Walter, 4, 44, 60, 74, 76, 79, 85.

    It is most likely that this was the same person who is described
    elsewhere as Master Walshe.

  Walsingham, for the king's offering to the image of our Lady of, 214.

    Offerings to the image of our Lady of Walsingham, were common at a
    very early period. William de Ufford, Earl of Suffolk, ordered by
    his will, dated in 1381, that a picture of a horse and man armed
    with his arms, should be made of silver, and offered to the altar
    of our Lady of Walsingham. _Testamenta Vetusta_, p. 115. In the
    _Vision of Pierce Plowman_ pilgrimages to our Lady of Walsingham,
    are thus noticed. "Hermits on a heape, wyth hoked staves, wenten to
    Walsingham."

  Warde Thomas, 53, 90, 145, 148, 250.

    It is evident that he was an artizan of some kind, probably a
    builder, as many of these entries relate to repairs at Windsor; and
    the others to payments made to him for new butts, rounds and pricks.

  Wardens brought, 105, 110, 126, 167, 265, 266, 274.

    Large pears. Cavendish describes Wolsey as eating _roasted wardens_
    at the moment in which he was seized with his fatal illness. "It
    came to pass at a certain season sitting at dinner in his own
    chamber, having at his boards end that same day, as he divers times
    had to accompany him, a mess of the Earls' gentlemen and chaplains,
    and eating of _roasted wardens_ at the end of his dinner, before
    whom I stood at the table, dressing of those wardens for him,
    beholding of him I perceived his colour often to change," &c. Ed.
    _Singer_, 1825, vol. i. p. 300. In a poem written by Lydgate temp.
    Henry VI. he thus alludes to _Wardens_.

    "Eke othere frutes, whiche that more common be,

      275, 277, 278.

    So little is known of the family of this individual, that the
    following particulars may be useful. He was the eldest son of Sir
    Richard Weston, of Sutton, Co. Surry, Knt. who in the Herald's
    Visitations of that county, is styled "Miles pro corpore, Magister
    Wardorum, Thesaurar' Calisie, et Sub-Thesaurar' Angliae." Sir
    Francis Weston was a Knight of the Bath, and Gentleman of the
    Privy Chamber, and fell a victim to a supposed criminal intimacy
    with Queen Anne Boleyn, in 1536. He married Eleanor, widow of Sir
    Henry Knyvet, Knt. and daughter and sole heiress of Eleanor, (the
    daughter and heiress of Sir Roger Lewknor, Knt. one of the co-heirs
    of the Barony of Camois,) by her first husband, Sir Christopher
    Pickering, Knt. By her, who remarried to her third husband, John
    Vaughan, of Crickhowell, and died in 1582, Sir Francis Weston left
    issue a son, Sir Henry Weston, Knt.: he was living in 1582, and had
    one son, Sir Richard Weston, and two daughters, Jane and Anne. Sir
    Richard was living in 1608, and his son Sir Richard was residing at
    Sutton in 1623, and by Grace, his wife, daughter, and heir of John
    Harper, of Chelston, in Co. Hereford, had issue Richard, then aet.
    5, John, Henry, and Francis. The descendants of Sir Francis Weston
    here mentioned are supposed to be extinct; and Mr. Lodge informs
    us that in 1782, William Webb, Esq. assumed the name of Weston, in
    compliance with the will of Mrs. Melior Mary Weston, the last of
    that ancient family.--_Illustrations_, vol. i. p. 30, note. See
    also the _Gentleman's Magazine_, vol. lii. p. 312. These entries
    shew the high favor in which he stood with the King. Cavendish
    makes him say,

    "I was dayntely noryshed under the king's wyng,
    Who highly favored me and loved me so well
    That I had all my will and lust in every thyng,
    Mynding nothing less than chaunce of my endyng;
    And for my dethe that present is nowe here,
    I looked not for, this fyvetie or thre-score yere."

    confounded with his father.

    Perhaps a dog's call, or more likely a call for Hawks. A whistle,
    was then, however, the insignia of a naval commander. Sir Edward
    Howard by his will, dated in 1512, bequeathed "his rope of bowed
    nobles that I hang my great _whistle_ by, containing CCC Angels, to
    Charles Brandon," afterwards Duke of Suffolk. _Testamenta Vetusta_,
    p. 534. The fact of Sir Edward's having thrown his _whistle_ into
    the sea when forced overboard by the pikes of the enemy in an
    attack upon some French ships in the harbour of Conquet, is well
    known.

    Most probably Lord William Howard, son of Thomas second Duke of
    Norfolk, by his second wife Agnes sister and heiress of Sir Philip
    Tilney of Boston, in Lincolnshire. He is stated by Collins, Ed.
    1779, vol. v. p. 15, to have accompanied the King to France in
    October, 1532, having in his retinue eleven servants and two
    horse-keepers. At the coronation of Anne Boleyn he performed the
    duties of Earl Marshal for his brother the Duke of Norfolk, who
    was then ambassador in France. During the reign of Elizabeth he
    distinguished himself as High Admiral of England, was created Lord
    Howard of Effingham, and a Knight of the Garter. From his Lordship
    sprung the Earls of Nottingham and Effingham, both of which titles
    are extinct, and the present Lord Howard of Effingham. On the first
    occasion in which he is mentioned in these Accounts he had won
    9_li._ of the King at Shovel-board, and on the other 40_li._ were
    given him "in reward."

    The following memoranda of the wines used in England at that and
    earlier periods, may perhaps be acceptable. In the _Vision of
    Pierce Plowman_, we find

    "Whyt wine of Osey, and red wine of Gascoyne
    Of the Renne, and of the Rochell the rosted to defye,"

    mentioned; and in the _Northumberland Household Book_ is an entry
    of "x ton ij hogisheds of Gascoigne wyne, for the expensys of
    my house for an hole yere, viz. iij ton of Rede wyne, v tonn of
    Claret wyne, and ij ton and ij hogisheds of white wyne after
    iiij_l._ xiij_s._ iiij_d._ the ton."--Ed. 1827, p. 6. In Lodge's
    _Illustrations_, vol. i. p. 17, Thomas Allen, in a letter to
    the Earl of Shrewsbury in 1516, says, "This day I trust to send
    towards Wyndfield ij tonne wyne; wherof iiij hogshedd claret, ij
    red wyne, on whit wyne, and th' oder punchin freche wyne. If hit
    be well carried, I trust your Lordship will lik hit well. Hit will
    cost v_li._ vj_s._ viii_d._ the tonne, wherof the weynes must have
    for their labour xx_s._;" and in another letter, dated in 1517,
    Allen informs the Earl; "I have bought iij ton of new Gascon wyne;
    weather your Lordship woll have new or olde sent downe I cannot
    tell. Your Lordship comands also iij hogsheds of wyne of ----
    or of wyne of Graves, and iij hogshedds of suche Frenche white
    wyne as ye had last yer of John Eston to be send; her is non yet

    Y^{r} Lordship hathe ij hogsheds of olde French wyne, of Byon, at
    Coleharbert; as for Rynishe wyne there cam never non so bad as com
    this yer; as sone as any comys that is good your Lordship shall
    have therof. As Alen Kyng sheweth unto me ther was ij vessell of
    Muscadyne wyne which wer good, the King had on, my Lord Cardinall
    th' oder."--_Ibid._ p. 31. Among the expenses of the Household of
    Thomas Kytson, Esq. printed in Mr. Gage's _History and Antiquities
    of Hengrave_, is the following interesting account of the wines
    used in the reign of Elizabeth, with their prices.--"December
    1572, For xiij gallons of Muscedell, at ij_s._ viij_d._ the
    gallon, xxxiiij_s._ viij_d._--for xx gallons j qrt. Malmesey, at
    ij_s._ the gallon, with x_d._ for spoonage, and carriage xlj_s._
    viij_d._:--for xj gallons iij qrts. Sack, at ij _s._ the gallon,
    with iiij _d._ for spoonage xxiij_s._ x_d._;--for xij gallons j
    qrt. Rhenish wyne xxiiij_s._ vj_d._" p. 193. No notice, however,
    occurs of Gaillac wine, which we learn from these Accounts in
    February, 1530, cost 5_l._ 8_s._ per ton; nor are any others than
    Rhenish and Malmsey wines mentioned in the MS. dated "Apud Eltham
    mense Jan, 22 Henry VIII," referred to in the _Archaeologia_, vol.
    iii. p. 156. The total amount expended in wines in the three years
    embraced by these Accounts, was, 2,516_l._ 4_s._

    hunting. With a single exception, when 40_s._ were paid for one
    with a girdle, these entries refer to presents of wood-knives from
    the Abbot of Reading. "Query, if a _Wood-knife_ was that short
    sharp-hanger, _couteau de chasse_, used in hunting, and with which

    Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Anthony Browne, and wife of the Earl

    her Ladyship was confined early in February, 1530. It must have
    been one of her younger children to whom she then gave birth, for
    her eldest son William, third Earl of Worcester, was born in 1527.

  York Place, Gardener of, 56, 57, 58, 59, 66.

  ----, Keeper of, 56.

    York Place or York House, now called Whitehall, belonged to
    the Archbishop of York, and was possessed by Wolsey in right
    of that See. Henry seized it in 1529, and made it one of his
    residences.--Hall says, "after Christmas, 1530, he [the King] came
    to his manor of Westminster, which before was called Yorke Place,
    for after that the Cardinal was attainted in the Premunire, and was
    gone north-*ward, he made a feoffement of the same place to the
    Kyng, and the Chapiter of the Cathedral of Yorke confirmed the same
    feoffement, and then the King chaunged the name, and called it the
    Kynges manor of Westminster, and no more Yorke Place." Ed. 1809,
    p. 774. Abundant proofs, however, exist in these Accounts, that it
    retained the name of York Place, until the period when they close,
    December, 1532.




ADDENDA.


It is stated in p. 41, that the next page, _i. e._ f. 20 of the MS.
is missing: the following notes of its contents, however, occur among
the extracts made from the MS. by Peter Le Neve, Norroy King of Arms,
early in the last century, and which are now preserved in the Lansdowne
MS. 737. It will at once be seen that Le Neve has not copied the MS.
literally; and there is cause to believe, either that he has omitted a
few items, or that there was a mistake in the calculation of the person
to whom these Accounts were entrusted. The latter conjecture is the
more probable of the two, for Le Neve seems only to have copied the
most striking entries.

Boleyn Lady Ann.

    The following are all the pages in which she is mentioned, whether
    as "my Lady Ann," "Lady Ann Rochford," or as the "Marchioness of

Bonvice Anthony.

    He was a "merchant stranger." "A grudge" between him and other
    foreigners and some persons in London, is noticed by Hall, ed.
    1809, p. 718.

Brakes.

    To the other references, p. 60 should have been added.

Brereton William.

    Some curious particulars of Brereton will be found in Cavendish's
    _Life of Wolsey_, Ed. Singer, vol. ii. p. 34, from which it appears
    that he was Gentleman of the Chamber, and Steward of the Holt in
    the Marches of Wales. Cavendish says he had "by colour of justice"
    produced the execution of one Eton,

    "A gentleman born, that thorowghe my myght,
    So shamefully was hanged upon a gallowe tree
    Oonly of old rankor that roted was in me."

Buttes Dr.

    It ought to have been remarked that Dr. Buttes is introduced
    by Shakespeare into "Henry the Eighth." His portrait occurs in
    Holbein's picture in Surgeon's Hall of Henry giving the charter to
    the Company of Surgeons.--_Anecdotes of Painting._


Chartesaye.

    Chelsea, in p. 309, is an error of the press: the place meant is
    clearly Chertsey in Surrey.

Crane, Master William.

    He was the Master of the Children of the Chapel; and in the _Book
    of Quarterly Payments_, 29-33 Henry VIII. an entry occurs of money
    given to him for the performance of the children, evidently in
    singing before the King.

Cromer Doctor.

    He is described by Cavendish as a "Scots Physician." Ed. Singer,
    vol. i. p. 222. Henry gave him 100 li. by his will.


Dompne.

    It has been since suggested to the Editor by very competent
    authority, that "_Dompne_ was the old English word for "Dominus,"
    which was often applied to a priest; and that perhaps the
    equestrian was such another as Sir John Hurt, see p. 330." Upon
    the correctness of this explanation he cannot however refrain from
    entertaining great doubts.

Dromslade.

    In the account of Queen Elizabeth's _Annual Expences_ among the
    "Musicians and Players" are "_Drumsteds 3_, fee apeece 18_l._
    5_s._" Dromslade is the Dutch for Drummer.


Gloves.

    Gloves are thus noticed in the _Vision of Pierce Plowman_;

    "Yea I have lent lords, that loved me never after
    And hath made mani a knight, both mercer and draper
    That payd not for his prentishod one _paire of glovis_."--p. xxiiij.

    And again,

    "And than gan a wastowre to wrath him and wolde have fought
    And to Piers the Plowman he profer'd _his glove_."

                                                    p. xxxiij. Ed. 1550.

Henxmen.

    Besides what has been said on Henxmen or Henchmen, it may be useful
    to add that "the schoolmaster for the Henxmen" formed part of the
    royal establishment, and the payment of his wages occurs in the
    _Book of Quarterly Payments_, 29-33 Henry VIII. Hall also speaks
    of such a person: "In the laste moneth called Decembre were taken
    certain traytors in the citie of Coventry, one called Fraunces
    Philippe, scholemaster to the Kynges Henxmen," &c. Anno 15 Hen.

Ink horns. Addenda, p. 366.

    It may perhaps be worth observing, that in the inventory of the
    effects of Henry V. we find "1 Penner, et ung _Ynk horn_ d'argent
    dorrey, pois vj unc', pris l'unce ij_s._ vj_d._" valued at xv_s._
    _Rot. Parl._ vol. iv. p. 226. Thus it seems the word was applied
    to a vessel for holding ink rather than to the material of which
    it was made. Those mentioned in these Accounts must have been very
    common ones, as a dozen cost only two shillings.

Latimer Master, for preaching before the King.

    It was probably to this occasion that Bishop Latimer alludes in a
    Sermon preached before the Duchess of Suffolk in 1552. Speaking of
    a woman who was accused of having killed her child, whom he visited
    in the prison at Cambridge, and ascertained to be innocent, he
    says, "Immediately after this I was called to preache before the
    Kyng, whyche was my firste Sermon that I made before His Majesty,
    and it was done at Windsor where His Majestye, after the Sermon was
    done, did most familiarly talke with me in a gallerye. Nowe when I
    sawe my tyme I kneelyd downe before His Majesty, openynge the whole
    matter," &c. The story is however too long to be inserted. Fol. 14.

    His portrait was painted by Holbein, and engraved by Holler.
    Walpole's _Anecdotes of Painting_.

Mules, 260. Addenda, p. 366.

    In April, 1530, two mules cost 22_l._ 10_s._ and in September,
    1532, the sum paid for three was 35_l._ Thus the price continued
    very nearly the same.


Norris Sir Henry.

    He was gentleman waiter to the King, and was the only person
    permitted to follow him into his bedchamber. _Archaeologia_, vol.
    iii. p. 155. Cavendish says he was also Groom of the Stole, vol.
    ii. p. 25. It would be most unjust to allude, ever so casually to
    Norris, and omit to state that he was offered a pardon if he would
    confess that Anne Boleyn was guilty, but that he preferred his
    honour to his life.


Owche.

    An _owche_ also meant bosses, buttons, clasps, or any ornamental
    trinket. The custom of wearing a brooch, or some kind of ornament,
    in the front of the hat, is noticed by all our old poets. See
    Massinger, by Gifford, iv, 213; Jonson, do. ii. 406.--M.


Pole Mr. Addenda, p. 365.

    Afterwards the celebrated Cardinal Pole, Archbishop of Canterbury.
    He is said to have been allowed a large pension to enable him to
    travel into Italy, but of which he was afterwards deprived. The
    entry in these accounts of 70_li._ was, it is most probable, a
    mere gratuity, or present, for we never find another instance of a
    similar payment. As Pole was then thirty years of age, the title of
    "the Kings _scholar_" is curious.


Rat-taker.

    The name of the rat-taker in the 30 Hen. VIII. was John Wolley.
    _Book of Quarterly Payments_, 29-32 Henry VIII.

Relick water.

    It has been suggested whether Relick water was not water in which
    some relicks had been immersed, with the view of giving it a
    sanative quality, which was probably supposed to be imparted to
    those who tasted of, or were sprinkled with it.

Removing day.

    This expression was thus used by Henry the Eighth: Sir Thomas More
    informed Cardinal Wolsey that he asked Henry to dispatch some
    business on the day on which his letter was written; "his Grace
    lawghed, and saied, Nay by my fayth, that will not be, for this is
    my _removing day_ sone at New Hall." Ellis's _Original Letters_,
    Second Series, vol. i. p. 293.

Rights.

    Much light is thrown upon this word, by the following entry in the
    _Book of Quarterly Payments_, 29-33 Hen. VIII.

    "Item for the Kingis offeringe this Sonday at _taking his Rights_
    in the mornyng, vj _s._ viij _d._"

    Thus it was clearly connected with a religious duty, though its
    precise meaning has not been ascertained. It is needless to observe
    that the conjecture on the subject in p. 347 is decidedly erroneous.

Rowme or Rome.

    This word is thus further illustrated: Cavendish makes Brereton say,

    "Furnished with _romes_ I was by the kyng,
    The best I am sewer he had in my contrie
    Stewart of the Holt, a _rome_ of great wynnyng
    In the marches of Wales, the which he gave to me."

    And imputes to Norris the remark,

    "Offices and _romes_ he gave me great plenty."

                                        Ed. Singer, vol. ii. pp. 25, 34.

    It is hence obvious that the explanation given in p. 348 is correct.


Sloppes.

    This word is further elucidated by the following extract from a
    letter from Richard Onslow, Recorder of London, dated in February,
    1565, stating that in consequence of a recent Proclamation several
    hosiers had applied to him to know whether they might "lyne a
    _Sloppe hose_ not cutte in panes wyth a lynung of cotton styched
    to the Sloppe, over and besydes the lynnen lynyng, and the other
    lynyng straytt to the legg: whereunto upon consideracyon of the
    wordes of the proclamacion I answered them all, that I thought
    surely they could not: and that any loose lynyng not straytt to
    the legg was not permytted, but for the lynyng of panes only, and
    that the hole upper stock being in our Sloppe uncutt could not be
    said to be in panes, wherewith they departed satisfyed. Sythens
    which tyme dyvers of them have been wyth me and declared that for
    as moche as they have refused to lyne the slopp so, their customers
    have gone from them to other hosyers dwellynge without Temple Barr,
    who not only have so lyned the Slopp, but also have sayd that your
    Honour hath declared, that they may lawfully so doe."--Ellis's
    _Original Letters_, Second Series, vol. ii. p. 307.

Skyppe Master.

    A John Skyppe, clerk, was the King's almoner in the 30 Hen.
    VIII.--_Book of Quarterly Payments._

Spurs to the choristers of Windsor, for the King's.

    In the time of Ben Jonson, in consequence of the interruptions
    to divine service occasioned by the ringing of the spurs worn
    by persons walking and transacting business in Cathedrals, and
    especially in St. Paul's, a small fine was imposed on them called
    spur money, the exaction of which was committed to the beadles and
    singing boys.--Note to Gifford's _Jonson_, vol. ii. p. 49.--M. The
    custom is not yet extinct; but whether the entries referred to in
    these Accounts were at all connected with it, is at least doubtful,
    for it must first be shown that it prevailed at so early a period.


Tomb, the King's.

    A doubt ought to have been expressed whether the payment in
    question did not relate to the tomb of Henry the Seventh, though
    the expression of "_the_ King's tomb" renders it more probable that
    it referred to one commenced by Henry for himself.


Virginals.

    This instrument, with a lady playing upon it, is given in the
    series of cards so beautifully engraved by Jost Ammin: the fool is
    in a ludicrous attitude in the back ground. See Singer _On Playing
    Cards_, 184. Earle, in his _Microcosmography_, says, that "She,
    the precise hypocrite, suffers not her daughters to learn on the
    Virginals, because of their affinity with _organs_." p. 97.--M.
    In the list of "Musicians and Players" in the account of Queen
    Elizabeth's _Annual Expences_, p. 266, are, "Virginall players, 3,
    fee apeece, 30 _li_." being nearly double as much as was allowed to
    any other musician.


Waits.

    Dr. Pettingall, in his remarks on the "Gule of August," says, "what
    we at present call 'the waits,' or the music on the nights of the
    Christmas holydays, is only a corruption of the wakes or nocturnal
    festivities." _Archaeologia_, vol. ii, p. 66.

ERRATA AND ADDENDA.


Preface, _p._ ii. _l._ 12. It ought to have been observed, that the

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
