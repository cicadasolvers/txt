There appears to be, from year to year, a growing popular taste for
quaint and curious reminiscences of "Ye Olden Time," and to meet this,
Mr. Henry M. Brooks has prepared a series of interesting handbooks. The
materials have been gleaned chiefly from old newspapers of Boston and
Salem, sources not easily accessible, and while not professing to be
history, the volumes contain much material for history, so combined and
presented as to be both amusing and instructive. The titles of some of
the volumes indicate their scope and their promise of entertainment:--

  CURIOSITIES OF THE OLD LOTTERY.
  DAYS OF THE SPINNING-WHEEL.
  SOME STRANGE AND CURIOUS PUNISHMENTS.
  QUAINT AND CURIOUS ADVERTISEMENTS.
  LITERARY CURIOSITIES.
  NEW-ENGLAND SUNDAY, ETC.

"It has been the good fortune of the writer to be allowed a peep at the
manuscript for this series, and he can assure the lovers of the
historical and the quaint in literature that something both valuable and
pleasant is in store for them. In the specialties treated of in these
books Mr. Brooks has been for many years a careful collector and
student, and it is gratifying to learn that the material is to be
committed to book form."--_Salem Gazette._

THE DAYS OF THE SPINNING-WHEEL IN NEW ENGLAND

_"To say that the past is of no importance, unworthy of a moment's
regard, because it has gone by, and is no longer anything, is an
argument that cannot be held to any purpose; for if the past has
ceased to be, and is therefore to be accounted nothing in the scale of
good or evil, the future is yet to come, and has never been
anything."_--HAZLITT.

       *       *       *       *       *

    "_In my young days, when I was_ leetle,
    _The only steam came from the kettle._

    ....

    "_The_ Gals _on good old Dobbins rid then,
    But folks don't do as they used to_ did _then._

    ....

    _"Heigho! I grieve, I grieve
    For the good old days of Adam and Eve._"

                    From HENRY J. FINN'S "Good Old Times,"

                               October, 1827.

  no thread that is not a twist of these two strands. By necessity, by
  proclivity, and by delight, we all quote."--EMERSON

THE DAYS OF THE SPINNING-WHEEL

IN NEW ENGLAND.

       *       *       *       *       *

WITHIN the last few years many young ladies have searched country houses
or ransacked old garrets to find spinning-wheels, which, like old
chairs, tall clocks, and warming-pans, have now become objects of
curiosity and interest to those who take a fancy to antique articles. It
has become fashionable to have these things to adorn our Queen Anne
houses. And brass andirons and shovels and tongs have come into request,
so that we may enjoy the luxury of an open wood fire, which, to our
mind, is one of the most cheerful things in this world. Some one has
remarked "that to be well-dressed gives a feeling of satisfaction that
religion fails to give;" but to us, to sit before a blazing wood fire on
a dull, cold evening, gives a feeling of comfort and delight which
surpasses anything we know of. What charming companionship in a wood
fire! Better than the company of uncongenial persons.

    "Old wood to burn,"
    "Old books to read:"

these are enough; we will leave out the "old wine to drink."

      "This bright wood fire,
    So like to that which warmed and lit
    My youthful days, how doth it flit
      Back on the periods nigher!
    Re-lighting and re-warming with its glow
    The bright scenes of my youth,--all gone out now."

Glance backward to some years before the Revolution, and we shall find a
spinning-wheel in every house, and then, probably, in constant use. Now
its place in our homes is taken by the piano. This instrument had not
then come into use. Something resembling it,--namely, the spinnet or the
harpsichord,--was to be found in some instances; but it was by no means
common to find these, for there was but little knowledge of music in
America in those days. A hundred years ago, only one or two churches in
Boston had organs, and the public taste, except in rare cases, was
decidedly against music of all kinds, especially sacred music. To show
how this was, we have heard an old lady say that when she was young,
some eighty years or so ago, "musicians, for the most part, were not
thought much of" by the most cultivated people of that time; and she
assured me that even at a later date, members of military bands, as well
as organists and violinists (then called fiddlers) were too often low
characters and men much addicted to drinking. The times were too hard
for the New England people of those days to cultivate music or indulge
in entertainments of any kind except "going to meeting." There was but
little money in circulation, and that was almost always in the form of a
depreciated currency. Gold and silver were scarce articles, and a large
proportion of the necessities of life and luxuries--if luxuries they
could be called; they would hardly be so considered by us--were imported
from England or elsewhere. The leading occupations were farming,
fishing, making New England rum, importing rum, sugar, and molasses
from the West Indies, and dry goods from England. The common people were
poor enough, in comparison with the condition of the same class at the
present time, when they make as good an appearance as the wealthy did a
hundred years ago. It would be safe to say that they have more comforts
and conveniences in their homes to-day than the more prosperous had at
the time of the Revolution. The humorist, John Phenix, said that "Gen'l
Washington never saw a steamboat, nor rode in a railroad car;" and
possibly his house was not heated by steam, or furnished with pipes for
hot and cold water. Nor did he ever use gas, or the telegraph or
telephone. Whether the people who lived then would have shown the
extravagance which characterizes our time if they had possessed the
means, is a question not easily to be answered; but it is certain they
were more frugal than we are, if not more industrious. The Revolution
left the masses of the people in rather a destitute condition, and they
were forced to be economical. Their habits were so entirely different
from modern habits that it would exceed our limits to undertake to draw
a careful comparison. It is said that the people of those days bewailed
the degeneracy of the times, and spoke of the industry and frugality of
earlier periods.

                                  NORWICH, May 6, 1784.

    A correspondent observes, that the extravagances of the
    present day are fully demonstrated in the broadcloth coats
    and silk gowns,--the powder and feathers, the ruffles and
    cardinals, the silk stockings and feet trappings--In the
    feasts, the dancing parties and select companies--and what
    is the more melancholy, all orders and degrees help form the
    circle.--Where is the simplicity in dress and manners;
    temperance in meats and drinks, which formed the virtuous
    characters of our illustrious ancestors?--O! the degeneracy
    of the times!

                                               _Salem Gazette._

Just as our ancestors did, as Macaulay says, in the days of Charles the
First; they thought they were not as good as their ancestors had been.
This habit of looking back to a time so remote that "distance lends
enchantment to the view," seems to be almost universal. It is this
feeling of reverence for the old that makes it so interesting to us, and
leads us to look at things of the past poetically rather than
practically; although it is true that sometimes the interest taken in
inconvenient and uncomfortable articles arises rather from their age
than from anything else. But oftentimes the very simplicity, solidity,
and strength of old furniture, for instance, is charming, in contrast
with the elaborate, unmeaning carvings and flimsy character of more
modern productions. We are beginning to see how much more sensible the
Chippendale and other styles commended by Eastlake and some other
writers on household art are to much that has been produced in later
times. Yet we must allow that prejudice and fashion go a great way in
determining our likes and dislikes, in furniture as well as in dress and
other things. Very likely in a few years we shall tire of the Queen Anne
houses and furniture, and hard floors, and have a surfeit of
_Anglomania_, especially if we carry the taste too far. In this country,
as Emerson says, "Every rider drives too fast." It is hard to be simple
and slow. We must build fast, eat fast, and live fast. But Emerson says
again, "Nature has no respect for haste." Herbert Spencer has given us
in a kindly spirit some hints on this score which it would be well to
heed. But we are wandering from our immediate subject. Our desire is to
illustrate, in the very words of the people of the period we refer to,
the views they entertained of economy and industry, and how they carried
them out. We will begin, then, in the year 1759, with a curious letter
to the "Boston Gazette" of June 11 of that year, in which the writer
gives some account of the cost of provisions at that period.

    _To the Trading and Farming People of_ New England.

        GENTLEMEN.

    I Have been coming and going among you since the Year 1745.
    I am now once more on Service in this Part of the World, and
    not a little surprized at the Alteration in the Value of
    your Provisions, since my Knowledge of your Country. When I
    first came among you, I could have bought a Pound of Beef
    for a Penny, a Goose for a Shilling, a Fowl for three Pence,
    and so in Proportion. It now is, I think, four Pence
    Sterling for a Pound of Beef, eighteen Pence Sterling for a
    Fowl, and three Shillings for a Goose. Pray Gentlemen, when
    that is the Price at _Boston_, what must we pay for it at
    _Louisbourg_, after it has gone thro' the Hands of many
    different People that are to live out of it. Our Pay is not
    increased.

    I would say nothing to influence you to sell cheaper, from
    Motives disinterested or publick spirited, as that weighs
    but little with the Generality of Mankind. But consider your
    own Interest, the War can last but little longer: This
    Campaign, in all Probability, will put an End to it, then
    where will you find a Market for your Stock you raise.
    Consider with the Fall of this present Summer, its pretty
    certain the Soldiers and Seamen at present employed for your
    Defence, will be called to Britain: Take the Market while it
    holds Gentlemen. We have Beef found us, that is to say, the
    Publick purchases it; let us now and then taste of your
    Veal, Mutton and Fowls for our Money, and we will spend all
    among you; and we expect both Interest and Inclination will
    prompt you to give us an ample Supply.

    I am your Friend, _An_ ANTI-CANADIAN.

       *       *       *       *       *

In the same paper is an auction advertisement, showing how they mixed
the different kinds of _property_.

    TO be Sold by publick Vendue on _Scarlet's_ Wharff, at the
    North End of _Boston_, THIS AFTERNOON, at IV o'Clock, Sundry
    Hogsheads of Sugar, four likely Negro Men, and a Parcel of
    old Copper; Prize Goods lately brought into this Port.

       *       *       *       *       *

On the 19th November we are shown how remittances were made in those
days.

    We hear that the Treasurer of this Province has received a
    Bill of Lading for two Boxes of Portugal Gold, ship'd by Mr.
    Agent Bollan, on board the Mercury Man of War, amounting to
    Twenty thousand six hundred and eighty Pounds, seventeen
    shillings and six Pence; being Part of the L27,000 granted
    by Parliament in 1757, to this Province, to recompence them
    for the Expences they were at in the Expedition in
    1756.--Said Ship may be daily expected.

       *       *       *       *       *

And here is a description of a vessel of the time.

    Mr. James Hudson came Passenger in the Vessel that arriv'd
    at Cape-Ann, mention'd in our last, which saw a Wreck in
    Lat: 36, he says, she was a Frigate built Ship of about 200
    Tons burthen, had a Lion Head painted yellow, a short Topgal
    on Quarter-Deck, a small Tafrail painted yellow, Quarters
    and Stern painted blue, had a large Trophies painted on her
    Stern and gilt, full of Water, and no living Person on
    board.

       *       *       *       *       *

On the 5th February in that year, this was the way they advertised for
recruits for the Government service, offering among other inducements,
"a Crown to drink the King's health."

    ALL able-bodied fit Men that have an Inclination to serve
    His Majesty King GEORGE the Second, in the first Independent
    Company of Rangers, now in the Province of _Nova-Scotia_,
    commanded by _Joseph Gorham, Esq_; shall, on inlisting,
    receive good Pay and Cloathing, a large Bounty, with a Crown
    to drink the King's Health. And by repairing to the Sign of
    the Bear in King-Street, _Boston_, and to Mr. _Cornelius
    Crocker_, Innholder in _Barnstable_, may hear the particular
    Encouragement, and many Advantages accruing to a Soldier, in
    the Course of the Duty of that Company, too long to insert
    here; and further, may depend on being discharged at the
    Expiration of the Time entertained for, and to have every
    other Encouragement punctually compli'd with.

       *       *       *       *       *

There was a meeting of "very agreeable Ladies" in the interests of
economy about the same time.

    In a large Circle of very agreeable Ladies in this Town, it
    was unanimously agreed to lay aside the Use of Ribbons, &c.
    &c. &c. for which there has been so great a Resort to
    Milliners in times past----It is hoped that this Resolution
    will be followed by others of the Sex throughout the
    Province--_How agreeable will they appear in their native
    Beauty, stript of these Ornaments, from the prevailing
    Motive of Love to their Country._

    We must after all our Efforts, depend greatly upon the
    Female Sex for the Introduction of Oeconomy among us: And
    those who have the Pleasure of an Acquaintance with them,
    assure us that their utmost Aid will not be wanting.

    So strong is the Disposition of the Inhabitants of this Town
    to take off the Manufactures that come from the Country
    Towns, especially Womens and Childrens Winter Apparel, that
    nothing is wanting but an Advertisement where they may be
    had in Town, which will be taken in, and published by the
    Printers of this Paper _Gratis_.

Labrador tea began to take the place of green and bohea.

    Messieurs EDES & GILL,

    THE use of _Hyperion_ or _Labradore Tea_, is every day
    coming into more general vogue among people of all ranks.
    The virtues of the plant or shrub from which this delicate
    _Tea_ is gathered, were first discovered by the
    _Aborigines_, and from them the _Canadians_ learned them. It
    soon became into such repute that quantities were sent to
    _France_, where I have heard say, it was soon in such
    demand, as alarmed the _French East-India_ company, and
    procured an ordinance prohibiting the importation of any
    more on the pain of death. So little do some politicians
    regard the health or even the life of man, when either of
    them appear to be incompatible with their particular
    interests, views and projects. Before the cession of
    _Canada_ to _Great-Britain_, we knew little or nothing of
    this most excellent herb: but since that we have been taught
    to find it growing on every hill and dale, between the Lat.
    40 & 60. It is to be found all over New-England in great
    plenty, and that of the best quality, particularly on the
    banks of _Penobscot_, _Kennebeck_, _Nichewannock_ and
    _Merrimac_. Immense quantities may be found on the mountains
    near the great lakes.

    Nothing short of the highest degree of infatuation and
    madness could ever have prevailed with us to introduce
    unwholesome Exoticks. The voice of reason crys louder than
    ever for their perpetual banishment; and the further use of
    them must be accounted for but by the force of invincible
    prejudice. This indeed sometimes leads to a preference of
    rank poison if far fetched and dear bought, to the most
    salubrious draught at hand, with little pains or cost, tho'
    of inestimable value.

                                                A TEA-DRINKER.

The following items, Sept. 17, 1759, throw some light on the state of
the country in some parts of New England, where, even if the "Lyons"
once seen at Cape Ann by Wood had departed, there were still some bears,
one having been seen within two miles of Boston.

    We hear from Brentwood, in New Hampshire Government, as two
    Children were gathering Beans in a Field, a large Bear came
    upon them and kill'd them both;--The Bear was pursued, but
    could not be found.

    Also from Chester, in the same Government, that a few Days
    after the above, another Bear came behind a Woman as she was
    walking along, not far from her House, and tore off the hind
    Part of her Gown, which he carried off in his Mouth;--but
    the Woman happily made her Escape from him.

    And from Kingston, in the County of Worcester, we hear, that
    on Tuesday last as Mr. Stephen Clark of that Town was out a
    Hunting after Bears, his Next Door Neighbour went out into
    his Cornfield just at Evening, and seeing something move
    which he thought was one of those Animals, shott at it, and
    upon his coming to the place, found it to be Mr. Clark as
    above-mention'd, shot thro' his Head, to his great surprize.

    We hear from Kittery, that in about 13 Days past, seven
    large Bears have been kill'd within a Mile of the Rev. Mr.
    Rogers's Meeting House.

    It is said some of these voracious Animals have ventured
    down even to some of the Seaport Towns at the
    Eastward.--Two of them were seen at Medford last Week; and
    one of them has been lately killed within two Miles of this
    Metropolis. Some have weighed above 300 lb. Wt.

When we remember the present condition of the city of Lynn, it is
interesting to note how that place stood in reference to the shoe
industry in the year 1762. The "Boston Gazette" of November 2 says:--

    We are confidently told, that in the Town of Lynn upwards of
    Forty Thousand Pair of Womens Shoes have been made in one
    Year, equal in Goodness to any imported from Abroad--It is
    thought that in a few Years they will be supply'd with
    Callimanco and other Stuffs manufactured in this Province.

The statement has often been made by connoisseurs that there was no
mahogany furniture in America before the Revolution; but this is a
mistake, for here, in the "Boston Gazette" of Feb. 5, 1759, is an
advertisement announcing the sale of a "Beautiful Mehogany Desk and
Book-Case." Probably this was an early specimen of such kind of work, as
mahogany, it is said, was not introduced into Europe long before this
time.

A curious advertisement of a runaway convict in Maryland appears in the
same paper, Sept. 15, 1759:--

                  Fifteen Pistoles Reward.

    RAN-AWAY from the Subscriber, (living at ANNAPOLIS, in
    MARYLAND) in _June_ last, a Convict Servant Man, named
    _Thomas Read_, alias _Cutbert_, about 25 or 30 Years of Age,
    5 Feet, 4 Inches high, well set, grey Eyes, large Nose, and
    had short brown curl'd Hair. He is supposed to be in
    _Boston_, or some of the Northern Governments; is a
    Jeweller, and Motto-Ring-Engraver, and is an artful
    talkative pert Fellow;--can write pretty well, and has
    doubtless help'd himself to a Discharge, Pass, or any other
    Writing to deceive, and suit his Purpose; His Apparel is
    probably genteel, as he had Money with him, a Watch in his
    Pocket, and a large Stock of Pride; By what Name he now goes
    is uncertain, as he has Impudence eno to pick & chuse any he
    should think proper.

    Whoever takes the said Convict Servant, and returns him to
    his Master, shall have FIFTEEN PISTOLES Reward, and
    reasonable Charges paid, by

In the year 1762 there appears to have been quite a stir in reference to
economy and home productions, and doubtless the spinning-wheels were
constantly in use. In the "Boston Gazette," November 2, is a very
curious letter of Henry Flynt, a noted teacher, addressed to the ladies
of North America.


                _To the_ LADIES _of_ NORTH AMERICA.

    LADIES,

    _I AM one of those who think it not only high Time but of
    the last Importance, that you should be publickly addressed:
    And of the many ingenious Pens, which in the Course of a few
    Years have informed and enlightened this Country, I have
    often wished that at least some one of them had been more
    particularly devoted to your Service. This would have
    agreeably prevented me in an attempt to which I find myself
    in all Respects but too unequal. Yet relying on your good
    Sense and Candour, I venture to lay at your Feet a few
    well-intended Sentiments, which tho' in a plain homespun
    Garb, I hope will not offend. I am convinced that at this
    present it is not only in your Inclination and Will, but
    also in your Power, to effect more in favour of your
    Country, than an Army of an Hundred Thousand Men; and indeed
    more than all the armed Men on this vast Continent._--Can a
    Woman forget her Ornaments? _Yes I know she can._ Deborah
    _once judged Israel, and some think it was never judged
    much better afterwards. But what tho't_ Deborah _or_ Jael
    _of their Ornaments, when the one was contriving, & the
    other driving the Nail that would go? What tho't beautiful_
    Esther _of her Ornaments, when those of her Kindred &
    Houshold were in immediate and imminent Danger, by the
    Decree treacherously obtained by_ Haman, _from the mouth of
    her beloved and almost adored_ Lord Ahasuerus _the Great?
    What tho't_ Judith _of her Ornaments, when she was severing
    the Head of_ Holofernes _from his Body, or while flying with
    the Prize to the Relief of her despairing Friends? The Time
    would fail me, were I to recount the wondrous Deeds and
    mighty Atchievements of renowned and honorable Women in all
    Ages._

    _I have but alluded to a few Instances, among many of divine
    Heroism in your Sex, which hath often saved a Country, when
    the dull ploding Wisdom of man has been totally at a Plunge.
    How near we are to such a_ Crisis, _is left to the
    Conjecture of others. It would be a little out of Nature to
    expect the Birth and Exploits of Heroines to take Place
    before those of Heroes. I believe we shall be furnished with
    both in their Order, as Occasion may require. All I think at
    present that can be reasonably expected or desired of you,
    is to consent to lay aside all superfluous Ornaments for a
    Season--after which they shall be surely returned to you
    again with Interests.--You shall be cloathed in Purple, and
    Scarlet, and Fine Linnen of our own, and with other glorious
    Apparel; which, if possible, shall add a Lustre to your
    native Charms._

Newport, R.I., has the reputation of having been engaged in the
slave-trade before the Revolution; and the following item, in the
"Boston Gazette," June 30, 1762, noticing without comment the arrival of
a Guinea trader there, would seem to show it to have been not an
uncommon occurrence.

    We hear from Newport, Rhode Island, That Capt. Carpenter was
    arrived there from the Coast of Guinea, having had 104 Days
    Passage, ten Days whereof they were without Meat, but had a
    Sufficiency of Rice and Corn. They lost but six Slaves out
    of 69 they bro't out with them.

On the 5th of November "the gunpowder treason and plot" was formerly
pretty generally remembered,--by the boys, at least, who made bonfires
and burned tar-barrels. We believe the custom has fallen into disuse
except in Salem and Marblehead, where there seems to be a little
"Colonialism" left. As recently as 1885 the writer saw a bonfire in
honor of the occasion on a hill near the latter place. In 1762 there
must have been quite a demonstration, if we can judge anything by a
vote of the town of Boston. Englishmen visiting us have sometimes
expressed astonishment at learning that this curious custom should still
be kept up here, while it had been abolished at home.

    Upon a motion made, _Voted_, That the Town will take all
    proper Measures, by keeping in their Children and Servants,
    & other Ways, to prevent the Disturbances which have
    sometimes happened on or about the 5th Day of November.

             Attest,
                  William Cooper, _Town-Clerk_.

    _Tuesday last (5th November) being the Anniversary of the
    happy Deliverance of the British Nation from the Popish
    Powder Plot, at Noon the Guns at Castle William and at the
    Batteries in this Town were fired: At One all the nine Men
    of War then in this Harbour also fired._

The accommodation offered for travel between Boston and New York before
the Revolution must have been slim enough, judging from an advertisement
in the "Boston Gazette" in 1761. Passengers then went by vessel from
Providence; that is, "Gentlemen Passengers." Whether ladies were
accommodated or not, does not appear; but perhaps they were in the habit
of going by stage, taking a week or so to accomplish the journey, or,
more than likely, few ever travelled at all in those times. In our day,
when every one is on the move, it is hard to realize this state of
things.

    _Notice is Given, That SAMUEL and WILLIAM CHACE, of_
    Providence, _have a suitable Vessel that goes steadily
    between there and_ New-York. _So that all Gentlemen
    Passengers and others that incline to take the Rout from_
    Boston _to_ New-York, _or from_ New-York _to_ Boston, _may
    be well accommodated._

                                    Providence, Aug. 29, 1761.

"In 1756," Watson says, "the first stage was started between
Philadelphia and New York by Mr. Butler; three days through in summer
time, five and six in winter. In 1765 a second stage was started, to go
through positively in three days. This was a covered Jersey
wagon,--fare, twopence per mile. In 1766 another stage, called the
'Flying Machine,' was started, to go through in two days,--threepence
per mile."

A brief account of Montreal in the "Boston Gazette," March 30, 1761.

                        NEW-YORK, March 23.

                Extract of a Letter from Montreal.

    ----"The Case of the poor Canadians is really deplorable,
    occasioned by the bankruptcy of the crown of France. Many of
    them who had, with great danger and labour, acquired estates
    worth 20,000 l. sterl. by the fur-trade, or otherwise, can
    now scarce procure a dinner. All their remittances from
    their mother country, consisted in bills on the French King,
    which are not now worth one farthing, as no body whatever
    will accept of them in payment. It is computed there is
    above the value of 3,000,000 l. sterling of these useless
    paper scraps, circulated through the colony, which, as a
    reward to the wretched inhabitants for all their hardships
    and fatigues, must now supply the place of affluence and
    independence. Most, if not all of them, are perfectly
    reconciled to the British government, as they can now with
    security enjoy any little property they have; whereas
    formerly, Governor Vaudreuil made no ceremony of seizing the
    produce of their lands, their merchandize and manufactures
    of every kind, and after conveying them to the King's store
    houses, paid to the proprietors any price he pleased. If the
    owners thereafter had occasion for any of their own
    commodities, they could not procure them under twenty times
    the price they had received.

    "Montreal in general is a well built town, but incapable of
    any defence. The churches are elegant, and the houses of
    some of their principal men are really magnificent; though
    few in number. The Hotel Dieu is by far the finest hospital
    I ever saw, every thing in it is extremely neat and
    convenient.

    "The people here are extravagantly fond of dress; a stranger
    would take Montreal to be a city inhabited by none but the
    rich and idle: they are all finely powdered, walk with their
    hats under their arms, and wear long coats, adorned with
    tinsel lace, and buttoned down to the extremity. Since I
    came here, I have not seen one man dressed like a tradesman.
    The ladies in general are handsome, extremely gay, and well
    bred."

In 1767 the best soap and "dipt" and "mould" candles were sold at the
post-office in Boston, according to an advertisement in the "Gazette" of
October 26. The candles were made of tallow, and gave but little light,
requiring almost constant snuffing. Other kinds of candles were not in
general use in New England in the last century. Sperm oil and sperm or
wax candles could be used only by the wealthy. Many families, for
economy, made their own candles. This practice was common in New England
down to within fifty years.

It will be recollected that Dr. Franklin's father was a tallow-chandler
in Boston, and that the Doctor himself worked at the business when a
boy. Elizabeth Franklin, whose name appears in the following
advertisement, was probably a relative of the family.

Every week the burials and baptisms in Boston were thus inserted in the
papers. The following is from the "Gazette" of Nov. 23, 1767:--

General Wolfe's Manifesto from the "Boston Gazette," Dec. 10, 1759.

    _As the Manifesto lately published was only a Translation
    from a French Manuscript, we are requested to publish the
    following, which is_

                  _General_ WOLFE's Manifesto,
                    _as written by Himself._

    THE formidable Sea and Land Armament which the People of
    _Canada_ now behold in the Heart of their Country is
    intended by the King my Master to check the insolence of
    _France_;--To revenge the Insults offered to the _British_
    Colonies, and totally deprive the _French_ of their most
    valuable Settlements in _North-America_.

    For these Purposes only is the Formidable Army under my
    Command intended.

    The King of _Great-Britain_ wages no War with the
    Industrious Peasant, the sacred Orders of Religion, or the
    defenceless Women and Children: To these in their
    distressful Circumstances His Royal Clemency offers
    Protection. The People may remain unmolested on their Lands,
    inhabit their Houses, and enjoy their Religion in Security.
    For these inestimable Blessings, I expect the _Canadians_
    will take no Part in the Great Contest between the two
    Crowns; But if by a vain Obstinacy, and misguided Valour,
    they presume to appear in Arms, they must expect the most
    fatal Consequences; their Habitations destroyed, their
    sacred Temples exposed to the Fury of an exasperated
    Soldiery; their Harvest utterly ruined, and the only Passage
    of Relief stopped up by a most formidable Fleet.--In this
    unhappy Situation, and closely attacked by another great
    Army, what can the wretched Natives expect from Opposition!

    THE unparelelled Barbarities exerted by the _French_ against
    our Settlements in _America_, might justify the bitterest
    Revenge in the Army under my Command; but _Britons_ breathe
    higher Sentiments of Humanity, and listen to the merciful
    Dictates of the Christian Religion. Yet should you suffer
    yourselves to be deluded by an imaginary Prospect of our
    want of Success; should you refuse those Terms, and persist
    in Opposition; Then surely will the Law of Nations justify
    the Waste of War, so necessary to crush an ungenerous Enemy:
    and Then, the miserable _Canadians_ must in the Winter have
    the Mortification of seeing those very Families, they have
    been exerting a fruitless and indiscreet Bravery for, perish
    by the most dismal Want and Famine.

    In this great Dilemma let the Wisdom of the People of
    _Canada_ shew itself!

    _BRITAIN_ stretches out a powerful, yet a merciful Hand,
    Faithful to her Engagements, and ready to secure them in
    their most valuable Rights and Possessions.

    _FRANCE_, unable to support _Canada_, deserts her Cause at
    this important Crisis, and during the whole War has assisted
    her with Troops, who have been maintained _only_ by making
    the Natives feel all the Weight of grievous and lawless
    Oppression.

account of the celebration of a royal birthday:--

                      _BOSTON, August 15._

    On Friday being the Birth-Day of the _Prince of Wales_, and
    the Anniversary of the Accession of the House of _Hanover_,
    and also of the Surrender of the _Havanna_, which was the
    immediate Means of bringing about the Peace; at One o'Clock
    the Guns at the Castle and Town Batteries were Fired; and in
    the Evening his Excellency the Governor gave a Ball at
    Concert Hall. There were present about 240 Gentlemen and
    Ladies; the Ball was opened by General _Shirley_ and the
    Governor's Lady about 8 o'Clock; the Country Dances began
    about nine, and about ten a Supper Room was opened, where
    was a very handsome Collation. The Ladies made a brilliant
    Appearance, and the Company expressed the highest Pleasure
    and Satisfaction on the Occasion, and broke up about two in
    the Morning. The whole was conducted with the greatest
    Order, Elegance and Decorum.

The great military "occasion" of those days was the annual parade of the
Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company. In June, 1763, that Company
celebrated its one hundred and twenty-fifth anniversary. In the "Boston
Post-Boy" of June 13 we have this account:--

    Monday last, agreeable to ancient Custom, the Artillery
    Company of the Province, appeared under Arms, being the
    Anniversary of the Election of Officers for the Company: A
    Sermon was preached by the Rev'd Mr. _Balch_ of _Dedham_, at
    the Old Brick Meeting-House, where his Excellency the
    Governor, the Members of his Majesty's Council and House of
    Representatives, with a Number of other Gentlemen, attended;
    after which they proceeded to Faneuil-Hall, where an elegant
    Dinner was provided; and in the Afternoon the following
    Gentlemen were chosen for the ensuing Year, viz.

                 _Thomas Marshall_, Esq; Captain,
                 Mr. _Josiah Waters_, Lieutenant,
                 Mr. _Jeremiah Belknap_, Ensign.

    In the Evening a plentiful Repast was given by the Officers
    newly elected, at Faneuil-Hall; where many loyal Healths
    were drank.

    this Town by the late dreadful Fire, generously ordered his
    Agent here to pay to the Gentlemen appointed to receive the
    Donations of charitable dispos'd Persons the Sum of _One
    Hundred_ Pounds, L.M. for the Relief of the Sufferers.

Mr. Apthorp, of New York, made this generous donation--a large sum for
that time--for the relief of the sufferers of his native place.

On the 30th of March, 1761, the "Boston Gazette" prints the following
among its items of news:--

    Freeholder in this Province; for they are true English

BOSTON IN OLDEN TIMES.--The "Boston Transcript," in a notice of the
newspapers published in Boston in 1767, of which there were ten, says:
The printer in those days was a man of "all work." If a negro or horse
was up for sale, the printer was the seller. The advertisements in these
old papers are curiosities in their line. The following notices appeared
in the advertising columns of the "Boston Evening Gazette," in 1741:--

    "To be sold by the Printer of this Paper, the very best
    negro woman in this town, who has had the small pox and the
    measles; is as hearty as a horse, as brisk as a bird, and
    will work like a beaver."

    "To be sold by the Printer of this Paper, a negro man about
    thirty years old, who can do both town and country business
    very well, but will suit the country best, where they have
    not so many dram-shops as we have in Boston. He has worked
    at the printing business fifteen or sixteen years; can
    handle axe, saw, spade, hoe, or other instrument of
    husbandry, as well as most men, and values himself, and is
    valued by others, for his skill in cookery."

This item, from a paper of 1767, seems to show that the Government was
not then obliged to have a "bill" to uphold silver, for it was evidently
in the ascendency; but there was no Western territory at that time, or
rather, it had not been discovered.

    Gold as well as Silver will be taken for the Tickets, and
    the Prizes paid off in like Manner. Prizes not demanded
    within Twelve Months after Drawing, will not be paid, but
    will be deem'd as generously given for the Purpose
    aforesaid, and applied accordingly.

Fashionable weddings in the days of the spinning-wheel were not so fully
described as they are at the present day. Nothing used to be said about
the "magnificent dresses," "best man," "ushers," "contracting parties,"

fact. Here are specimens of marriage announcements,--persons belonging

The "Virginia Gazette" gives an account of an early and bold attempt at
British impressment of seamen. This business caused us a great deal of
trouble in after years, and was one of the causes of "Madison's War," as
the old people were fond of calling it.

The press-gang was one of the peculiar institutions of Great Britain.

                                       BOSTON, October 26, 1767.

    By the Virginia Gazette, of the first Instant, it appears
    that Captain Morgan, of the Hornet Sloop of War, concerted a
    bloody riotous Plan, to impress Seamen, at Norfolk, for
    which Purpose, his Tender was equipped with Guns and Men,
    and under Cover of the Night said Morgan landed at a public
    Wharff, having first made proper Dispositions either for an
    Attack or Retreat, then went to a Tavern, and took a
    chearful Glass, after which they went to work, and took
    every Person they met with, and knocked all down that
    resisted; and dragged them on board the Tender; but the Town
    soon took the Alarm, and being headed by Paul Loyal, Esq; a
    Magistrate, they endeavoured to convince Capt. Morgan of his
    Error, and being deaf to all they said he ordered the People
    in the Tender to fire on the Inhabitants, but they refused
    to obey their Commanders Orders, and he was soon obliged to
    fly, leaving some of the Hornets behind, who were sent to
    Gaol, but were afterwards released.

Mr. John Ashton, in his recently published work on "Social Life in
England at the end of the Eighteenth Century," informs us that one
evening in the year 1790, 2,100 men were pressed in London alone,
besides many more at the seaport towns.

In the summer of 1762 there was a severe drought in Massachusetts, and
the Governor issued a proclamation recommending public prayers for rain;
but it will be noticed that he says if rain should come before the day
set apart for prayers, then, instead of humiliation, it would be the
duty of the people to make it a day of thanksgiving. The proclamation
referred to was published in the "Boston Post-Boy" of July 13, 1762.

                           By HIS EXCELLENCY

                         FRANCIS BERNARD, Esq;

    Captain-General and Governor in Chief, in and over His
    Majesty's Province of _Massachusetts-Bay_ in _New-England_,
    and Vice-Admiral of the same.

                            A PROCLAMATION

                    _For a Day of Public Prayer._

    IT having pleased Almighty God to visit this Province with
    another severe Drought, which, if it should continue much
    longer, cannot fail of bringing great Distress upon the
    Inhabitants thereof--We are again called upon to supplicate
    the Interposition of Divine Providence to relieve this
    Country from the imminent Danger with which it is threatned,
    by dispensing timely and plentiful Rain.

    I HAVE therefore thought fit to appoint, and I do, by and
    with the Advice of His Majesty's Council, appoint Wednesday
    the Twenty-eighth Day of this Instant _July_ to be a Day of
    Public Prayer throughout the Province: Whereon the whole
    People may as at one Time humble themselves before Almighty
    God, acknowledging their great Unworthiness, and confessing
    their manifold Sins, and imploring the Supreme Dispenser of
    all Good, that He would be graciously pleased not to
    with-hold from them the Fruits of the Earth, but by
    seasonable and refreshing Rains bring what yet remains
    undestroyed to a due and seasonable Maturity.

    AND WHEREAS some Places have been exempted from the general
    Want of Rain; and it is to be hoped that before the Day
    appointed as aforesaid, many others, and possibly the whole
    Province, may have a gracious and timely Relief: It will be
    our Duty to intermix Thanksgiving with Humiliation, in such
    a Manner as the State of the Province, and particular Parts
    thereof, shall at that Time require.

    And I do order the said Day to be observed as a Day set
    apart for Religious Worship, and that no servile Labour or
    Recreation be permitted thereon.

Lectures were not common in the last century. It was not until within
fifty or sixty years ago, when Lyceums began to be established, that the
lecture system became developed.

We find that in 1769 a Mr. Douglass lectured in Boston, according to an
advertisement in the "Chronicle," August 17th.

The well-known Colonel David Mason of the Revolution, who was a
prominent figure among the patriots at Leslie's Retreat at the North
Bridge in Salem in February, 1775, was one of the earliest, if not the
very first, to lecture in Salem upon a scientific subject. In the "Essex
Gazette," Jan. 15, 1771, we find his advertisement:--

            _No longer than next Week, will
        Continue to be exhibited, every Evening
    in which the Air is dry, (Saturday and Sunday
    excepted)_

           The Course to consist of two Lectures,
               At a Pistareen each Lecture.

    As the Knowledge of Nature tends to enlarge the human Mind,
    and give us more noble, more grand and exalted Ideas of the
    AUTHOR of Nature, and if well pursued, seldom fails
    producing something _useful_ to Man, 'tis hoped these
    Lectures may be thought worthy of Regard and Encouragement.

When we see the great waste of paper in these days,--handbills,
circulars, and newspapers, which are blowing about the streets at
times,--we sometimes wonder how it was in 1767, on October 19, when the
following notice appeared in the "Boston Gazette."

    --> _THIS is to give Notice, That on_ TUESDAY _the 27th
    Instant, the Bell-Cart will go thro'_ Boston, _to collect
    Linnen Rags for_ Milton _Paper-Mill; as the highest Price
    will be given, all House-keepers and others are desired to
    have them in Readiness.--And, as it appears that all Sorts
    of Paper now to be imported, will come at a much higher
    Price than usual--if People will but save their Rags, it
    will not only be greatly interesting to the Public that the
    aforesaid Mill should have a full Supply, but will also
    encourage the manufacturing of all such different Sorts of
    Paper as are generally used among us, and a little to spare
    the neighbouring Governments._

       *       *       *       *       *

Here are two notices,--the first, nearly eight years before the battle
of Lexington, sounds warlike; the second is a call to promote greater
economy on the part of the inhabitants.

    IT is rumoured, and some say with great Probability, that a
    Body of Troops are ordered to be in Readiness at Halifax, to
    embark to any Part on the Continent of America, upon the
    first Notice of Uneasiness at the Novelties we daily
    expect.--It is as certain that America is also in Readiness
    to defend their Liberties at the Risque of every Thing
    else--there can be no Hesitation whenever the Alternative
    shall be Slavery or Death--If therefore they wait to know
    whether we will tamely submit to Slavery, the sooner the
    Matter is bro't to a Crisis the better.----But while we have
    any Opinion of the Integrity and good Sense of the
    Parliament of G.B. such Reports will not easily gain Credit.

Timothy Pickering, the father of the distinguished Revolutionary officer
and statesman of the same name, addressed an open letter to King George
III., which is printed in the "Salem Gazette," Oct. 31, 1769. It is a
very quaint production, but it shows the writer's love of simplicity and
downright honesty. He was a sturdy Puritan.

                                              "Oct. 31, 1769.

    "TO THE KING OF GREAT BRITAIN.

    "GREAT SIR,--Your Kingdom is like a House divided against
    itself. Something Extraordinary must be done. Our
    Parliaments for fifty years past (or some of them) have
    ruined the Nation, in making a monstrous Debt by hiring
    Money, while greater Sums have been expended in Pride and
    Luxury. Thirteen hundred Thousand Pounds Sterling, the
    Public Prints tell us, is paid annually to the Dutch as
    Interest money. My Advice is that all Rulers and Officers,
    who have high Salaries, drop them, except so much as is
    necessary for plain Living;--(Samuel had more Honour in his
    plain Living with his upright Mind, than Saul had in all his
    Princely Grandeur,)--And that all unnecessary Pensions cease
    together with military Officers half-pay, (How Unequal are
    our Ways: These Officers must have large Half-Pay, while the
    common Soldiers are not allowed small Half-Pay--who have
    been exposed generally to greater Hardships than their
    Officers. Either let all have Half-Pay or none. The Soldiers
    are to be respected as well as their Officers and are as
    necessary,) and that high Taxes _very high_ be laid on all
    Pride and Luxury, wherever it is found, the Clergy and the
    Women not excepted; And that great Taxes be laid on the
    Rich. I have an Income of but about eighty Pounds Sterling a
    Year, including my own Hands Labour, nevertheless I am
    freely willing to pay one quarter Part of it in Taxes till
    my Public Debts are paid. Others that have Two hundred a
    Year, can with Ease pay one half of it in Taxes, if need be.
    _Pay thy Debts_; Owe no man anything is Law, _Divine and
    Moral_. Immoral Men are in the road that leads to Hell; if
    they attend Public Worship, they are Hypocrites, like the
    Scribes and Pharisees, of whom _Christ_ said, Ye are of your
    Father the Devil. If I understand the Apostle, when such Men
    sit or kneel at a Communion Table, it is a Table of Devils
    to them. Pray, Sir, tell your Placemen that the vast
    Multitude of your Subjects are very uneasy that so much of
    the Public Money, when raised is sunk in the Gulph of
    Exhorbitancy. My Governor, Mr. Francis Bernard, demands a
    thousand Pounds Sterling a Year; one half that Sum is more
    than Enough, especially as the Nation is ready to sink with
    the Weight of its Public Debt. The _Clergy_ can tell their
    Congregations that the New Testament rather reproves than
    commands the wearing of costly Array and faring sumptuously
    every Day; And I may venture to tell my Readers that all
    those who neglect taking a conscientious care to pay their
    Debts, private Debts, as well as public, are in the high Way
    to Destruction; the commonness of the Sin don't abate the
    Malignity of it.

    P.S. Your Majesty sees how diligent Governor Nehemiah was in
    reforming what was amiss in Israel. He was obliged indeed to
    contend with the Nobles and the Rulers who opposed him, but
    he subdued them, and no wonder! Because he feared God and
    not Man.

    From a loyal Subject of my King and a sincere Friend to his
    Kingdom.

                                             TIMOTHY PICKERING.

Mr. Pickering wrote a letter to his son, while the latter was a student
at Harvard College, requesting him not to play at cards, a practice
which he regarded as wicked. But the son (Colonel Timothy Pickering
afterwards), as Mr. Upham, his biographer, well remarks, was altogether
too busy with his studies to waste time over cards.

We do not observe in the old papers much that would indicate a belief in
modern Spiritualism; but it would seem from some accounts that "angels"
were occasionally seen. In the cases we quote, the kind of "angels" is
not stated. Whether they were real live beauties, or not, can only be
conjectured. Who would not now like to buy one of these books at "four
Coppers," so as to read all about these angels?

In the "Boston Post-Boy" for Dec. 12, 1763, is an account of the
dedication of the Synagogue in Newport, R.I.

                    _NEWPORT, December 5._

    _On Friday last, in the Afternoon, was the Dedication of the
    new Synagogue, in this Town. It began by a handsome
    Procession, in which were carried the Books of the Law, to
    be deposited in the Ark. Several Portions of Scripture, and
    of their Service, with a Prayer for the Royal Family, were
    read, and finely sung by the Priest and People. There were
    present many Gentlemen and Ladies. The Order and Decorum,
    the Harmony and Solemnity of the Musick, together with a
    handsome Assembly of People, in an Edifice the most perfect
    of the Temple Kind perhaps in America, and splendidly
    illuminated, could not but raise in the Mind a faint Idea of
    the Majesty and Grandeur of the antient Jewish Worship
    mentioned in Scripture._

We find by the "Salem Mercury" of March 30, 1789, that New Hackensack
was fifty or sixty years before Rochester in "rappings" and
"table-tippings." Who shall say that these manifestations, whatever they
are, are not as old as man himself? The best and wisest of us do not
know everything. There may be some science, yet in its infancy, which
will some day be explained, so that all these things will then be
perfectly understood. The account here given has no appearance of
deception. Had the girl lived a hundred years earlier, she would in all
probability have been hanged for a witch; but had she lived in these
days, she might have reaped a harvest from lectures and seances.

    "Were I to relate the many extraordinary accounts of the
    unfortunate girl at New-Hackensack, your belief might,
    perhaps, be staggered. I shall therefore only inform you of
    what I was an eyewitness to. Last Sunday afternoon myself
    and wife went to Dr. Thorn's, and after sitting sometime, we
    heard a knocking under the feet of a young woman that lives
    in the family; I asked the Doctor what occasioned the
    noise--he could not tell, but replied, that he, together
    with several others had examined the house, but were unable
    to discover the cause. I then took a candle, and went with
    the girl into the cellar--there the knocking also continued;
    but as we were ascending the stairs to return, I heard a
    prodigious rapping on each side, which alarmed me very much.
    I stood still some time looking around with amazement, when
    I beheld some lumber, which lay at the head of the stairs,
    shake considerably. About eight or ten days after, we
    visited the girl again--the knocking still continued, though
    much louder. Our curiosity induced us to pay the third
    visit, when the phenomena were still more alarming. I then
    saw the chairs move; a large dining table was thrown against
    me, and a small stand on which stood a candle, was tossed
    up, and thrown in my wife's lap; after which we left the
    house, much surprised at what we had seen."

Advertisements for runaway slaves are very numerous, as well as offers
for the sale of single slaves. In some instances negro children are "to
be given away." The following notices are taken from the "Boston

appearance, etc., are very curious.

We have not been able to find that any of the inhabitants of Salem
engaged in the slave-trade; but we notice that at a town-meeting held in
the month of May, 1773, the following vote was passed: "That the
Representatives of the Town be instructed to use their utmost Endeavours
to prevent the future Importation of Negroes into this Province; their
Slavery being repugnant to the natural Rights of Mankind and highly
prejudicial to the Province." It is of course possible that some Salem
people may have been interested in vessels hailing from other places and
engaged in this nefarious traffic, as it is now considered.

The celebrated revival preacher Rev. George Whitefield was in Boston in
1764. We take the following item from the "Boston Post-Boy" of February
24:--

    At a Meeting of the Freeholders and other Inhabitants of the
    Town of Boston on Friday last, it was voted unanimously,
    That the Thanks of the Town be given the Rev. Mr. GEORGE
    WHITEFIELD, for his charitable Care and Pains in collecting
    a considerable Sum of Money in Great-Britain, for the
    distressed Sufferers by the great Fire in Boston, 1760; and
    a respectable Committee was appointed to wait on Mr.
    WHITEFIELD to inform him of the Vote, and present him with a
    Copy thereof, which Committee waited upon him accordingly,
    and received the following Answer,

      _Gentlemen,_

    _This Vote of Thanks for so small an Instance of my
    good-will to_ Boston, _as it was entirely unexpected, quite
    surprizes me----Often have I been much concerned that I
    could do no more upon such a distressing Occasion.----That
    the Redeemer may ever preserve the Town from such like
    melancholy Events, and sanctify their present afflictive
    Circumstances to the spiritual Welfare of all its
    Inhabitants, is the hearty Prayer of,_

Within the writer's recollection, in nearly every house in Salem two or
more fire-buckets, marked with the owner's name, were, when not in use,
kept hanging in the front hall. At fires, lanes, as they were called, of
men were formed, under the direction generally of the fire-wards, and
water was passed from one to another and to the fire from some
neighboring pump or cistern.

    _Boston, December 6, 1759._

With regard to policies, the term "under-writer" came from an old
custom. There were in old times no joint-stock companies for insurance,
but policies were filled out and left at an office kept by some person
for the purpose, where any responsible man could sign his name to a
particular policy and affix such sum as he was willing to risk, and thus
become one of the "underwriters." We have seen, for instance, a policy
for $20,000 with twelve or fifteen names of merchants, signed with
various sums from $500 upwards.

    Days Illness, OBADIAH BROWN, Esq; in the 50th Year of his
    Age. He was one of the most considerable Men in this Town:
    In the various Branches of Business which he carried on, his
    Activity was unequalled, his Judgment and Prudence oftener
    admired than imitated, his Honesty and Integrity fit to be
    drawn into Example.--As a Magistrate, he was judicious,
    grave, and reserved:--As a Friend, constant, open,
    facetious, and cheerful:--In the Relations of a Husband,
    Father, and Master, the deep and real Sorrow of his Widow,
    the mournful Tears of his Children, and the unusual Cries
    and Lamentations of his Servants, are invincible Proofs in
    his Favour. His Beneficence is witnessed by the Sighs of the
    Poor and Thanks of the Tradesmen: And his Death is
    universally lamented, because his Life was universally
    useful.

                             _Charlestown, December 10, 1763._

    ON Tuesday last departed this Life, after a short Illness,
    the Hon. DANIEL RUSSELL, Esq; who, for upwards of Twenty
    Years, was a Member of his Majesty's Council for this
    Province: He also served the Province as Commissioner of
    Impost, and the County of Middlesex as Treasurer, for more
    than fifty Years; in the Discharge of all which Offices,
    such was his conscientious Fidelity and unsullied Integrity,
    as procured him universal Approbation and Esteem.

    In public and private Life, his whole Conduct was such as
    evidently showed his invariable desire and endeavour to
    preserve a Conscience void of Offence both towards God and
    Man; and by the Rectitude of his Behaviour, to adorn and
    recommend the holy Religion which he professed, and to
    approve himself to the all-searching Eye of the Father of
    Spirits.

    His Memory is greatly honoured by all who were acquainted
    with him, in whose esteem he was truly that "noblest Work of
    God, _An honest Man_."

    It is observable that in the several Offices which he
    sustained, he succeeded his worthy Father and Grandfather;
    both of whom held and discharged the same, for a great
    Number of Years, with unspotted Reputation.

    His Remains, we hear, will be inter'd on Monday next, on
    which Day, had he lived, he would have entered the 79th Year
    of his Age.

             "Shall flourish when he sleeps in dust."

    performed, and was from thence carried into the Vaults
    below, and there interred. Whilst the last Service was

    between the inhabitants and the soldiers quartered in this

    persons were killed and wounded,

    Mr. Samuel Gray, ropemaker, killed.--A Mollatto man, named
    Johnson, killed.--Mr. James Caldwell, mate of Capt. Morton's
    vessel, killed.--Mr. Samuel Maverick, wounded, and since
    dead.--A Lad named Christopher Monk, wounded.--A lad named
    John Clark, wounded.--Mr. Edward Payne, Merchant, standing
    at his entry-door, wounded in the arm.--Mr. John Greene,
    taylor, wounded.--Mr. Patrick Cole, wounded.--David Parker,
    wounded.

    regiments should go down to the barracks at Castle-William,
    as soon as they were ready to receive them.

This is all the "Boston Chronicle" has to say about that great
historical event of the fifth of March, an event which stirred the whole
country and filled the minds of the Colonists with a perfect hatred of
the British power in America,--"The Boston Massacre." The editor of the
paper was probably a Tory.

We do not see much in the papers about spinning-wheels until after the
War of the Revolution; then there seemed to be what may be called a
revival of domestic industry. In 1786 the ladies of Hartford, Conn.,
formed an Economical Association. They say that they are "fully sensible
that our calamities are in a great measure occasioned by the luxury and
extravagance of individuals, and are of opinion that it is a duty they
owe their country as well as their families to retrench as far as
possible all unnecessary expenses." Their articles of agreement were
signed, on the 6th of November, 1786, by more than a hundred ladies
belonging to the first families in the city. By these articles they
engage "not to purchase for next six months any Gauze, Ribbons, Lace,
Feathers, Beaver-Hats, Silks, Muslins, and Chintzes, except only for
weddings and mourning;" also to "dress their persons in the plainest
manner and encourage industry, frugality, and neatness, giving all due
preference to the manufactures of their own country." To this they add
that "when they receive visits and make entertainments, it will be their
study to avoid unnecessary expense, especially on foreign articles." On
June 17 of that year the President of Harvard College addressed a
letter to the "Massachusetts Gazette" which is interesting in this
connection. This letter we copy to show how economy entered into
everything, even a "liberal education." It will moreover be of interest
because of the attempt made to regulate the students' dress.

                                        UNIVERSITY IN CAMBRIDGE,
                                               JUNE 17, 1786.

    _To the Publisher of the Massachusetts_ Gazette.

    EVERY proper attempt of the Governours of the University to
    lessen the expense of a liberal education must be grateful
    to the Publick, and meet with their hearty concurrence; the
    Members of the Community, therefore, in general, and the
    Parents and Guardians of the Students in particular, it is
    not doubted, will be well pleased with some late
    regulations, made by the Corporation and Overseers, to
    introduce economy in dress, and will readily perform their
    part, in carrying them into effect.

    By ordering an uniform, the Governours of the Society have
    removed the temptation to that frequent change of apparel,
    which may have arisen from the liberty the Students have
    had, of chusing different colours, from time to time: And by
    entirely prohibiting silk (an unnecessary article in their
    clothing) a very considerable expense is prevented.

    That the dress of the Students be neat and decent is highly
    proper; but that it should be very ornamental and expensive
    is ever needless, and oftentimes pernicious: Nor will any
    Student, who is solicitous to acquire knowledge, and
    sincerely disposed to improve his time to the best
    advantage, in obtaining such degrees of it, as may enable
    him to be extensively useful to the Community, feel a
    reluctance to economical institutions respecting dress. He
    will not only esteem the ornaments of the mind of vastly
    higher importance than those of the body, but the general
    good will also constantly influence his conduct; and he will
    chearfully encourage every regulation, which tends to
    promote frugality.

    The regulations referred to, I now transmit to you, which
    the Corporation and Overseers of the University request you
    to publish, for the information of all concerned.

        I am, Sir, your humble servant,

                          JUNE 13, 1786.

    WHEREAS the enjoining of an uniform colour, in the clothing
    of the Undergraduates, and prohibiting a certain species of
    materials, in their apparel, will have a great tendency to
    lessen the expense of dress (which, at present, constitutes
    too large a proportion of the Collegiate charges) while, at
    the same time, the appearance will be more academical:

    _Voted_, That it be recommended, that the Freshmen, who
    shall be admitted into the University the present year,
    before the end of the Summer Vacation, be provided with
    coats of blue-gray, being a mixture of deep blue and white
    wool, as nearly as may be, seven eighths of the blue, and
    one eighth of the white, or, if that cannot conveniently be
    obtained, of a dark blue colour,--and with waistcoats and
    breeches of the same colour, or of a straw colour.

    That, when they shall procure clothes, afterwards, and while
    Undergraduates, their coats shall be of the colour first
    mentioned, and their waistcoats and breeches of the same
    colour, or of a straw colour.

    That the Freshmen, who shall be admitted into the University
    in the year 1787, and afterwards, shall be provided with
    coats of the colour first mentioned, and with waistcoats and
    breeches as last mentioned, and shall continue provided with
    clothes of these specified colours while they remain
    Undergraduates.

    That all, who shall hereafter be admitted, when they
    commence Sophimores, shall have the addition of frogs to the
    button holes of their coats, the cuff of the sleeve to be
    plain.

    That when they commence Junior Sophisters, their coats shall
    have the further addition of frogs on the
    button-side,--continuing the plain cuff; and they shall also
    provide themselves with black gowns, having a close sleeve
    and slit cuff, to be made according to the direction of the
    Corporation.

    That, when they commence Senior Sophisters, they shall have
    the further addition of buttons and frogs to the cuff of
    their coat, and shall also have black gowns, with a wide
    sleeve,--the mode to be determined by the Corporation.

    That when they are admitted to the Bachelor's degree, they
    shall appear in like gowns and clothes as are prescribed for
    the Senior Sophisters.

    That the Seniors and Juniors shall wear their black gowns,
    on all publick occasions, and whenever they shall publickly
    declaim in the Chapel.

    That no Undergraduate, to whom these injunctions may extend,
    be permitted to appear within the limits of the College, or
    town of Cambridge, in any other dress than is before
    described, unless he has on a night gown, or an outside
    garment be necessary over his coat.

    That no part of the dress of the Undergraduates be made of
    silk;--and that it be recommended to them, to clothe
    themselves in home manufactures, as far as may be.

    That these regulations be extended to all who shall
    hereafter be admitted into the University;--and that it be
    recommended to such as are already Members, to conform
    thereto, upon principles of economy, as far as may consist
    with their present supply of clothing.

    and deliver'd to one capt. _Stevens_, as appears by said
    _Gordon's_ book; and thro' some mistake in keeping his
    books, said articles are charg'd to another of the same
    name. If therefore the said capt. _Stevens_, that really had
    said goods, or any of his family, or others, can give any
    light into the matter, it is desired they would acquaint the
    printers hereof, and they shall be generously recompenced

    Parsonage-house, with their spinning-wheels and other
    utensils of industry, for the day, to the benefit of their
    minister's family. The assembly having first united in the
    solemn exercises of social worship, the business of the day
    was opened. Every apartment in the house was full. The
    musick of the spinning-wheel resounded from every room.
    Benevolence was seen smiling in every countenance, and the
    harmony of hearts surpassed even the harmony of wheels. The
    labours of the day were concluded about 5 o'clock; when the
    fair labourers presented Mrs. MURRAY with cotton and linen
    yarn, of the best quality, amounting to 236 skeins.
    Necessary refreshment being past, publick worship was

The habit of Snuff-taking was formerly very prevalent in New England, as
well as elsewhere. Within the writer's recollection it was a very common
thing to see the snuff-box passed round for friends to take a pinch.
Very few now a days indulge in this uncleanly habit; but a recent
traveller relates that on visiting St. Peter's in Rome, the first thing
upon entering the church which attracted his attention was seeing the
Pope take a pinch of snuff and then shake from his pocket a large
old-fashioned bandanna handkerchief, which he applied to his nose. Many
years ago a gentleman of Salem was questioned by a stranger about a
certain man who happened to be an inveterate snuff-taker and who was at
the same time greatly interested in free-masonry. "Yes," said the
gentleman, "I know him."--"He's about one third masonry and two thirds
snuff." Mr. Francis H. Lee, of Salem, has a curious collection of a
hundred or more snuff-boxes of former generations. They are of various
patterns; some are made of shell and tipped with silver, and look quite
ancient. Simon Elliot, of Boston, and later Wm. Micklefield, of Salem,
were famous snuff manufacturers.

    E. COPELAND, Jr., has for sale a most elegant Gold SNUFF BOX
    set with Pearls, &c. It is about 21/2 inches long and from the
    top a beautiful _little Bird_ rises at command and sings a
    tune. The movements of the wings, beak, eyes, &c. are
    perfectly natural, and all its motions while singing are in
    complete unison with its notes. This is probably as
    ingenious a piece of mechanism as was ever seen in this
    town. It will be sold a great bargain.

much respected, and noted for his liberality and public spirit.

About 1787 and 1788, spinning-wheel meetings seem to have been very
popular. We copy notices of meetings of young ladies in Attleboro',
Dighton, Gloucester, Rehoboth, Mass., and Providence and Johnston, R.I.,
all from the "Salem Mercury."

    ATTLEBORO', _June 20_. Yesterday, 63 respectable young
    ladies, belonging to this town, asslembled, at 2 o'clock,
    P.M. at the house of Mr. Daniel Balkum, and, to the surprise
    and great satisfaction of all the friends to industry, spun,
    before sunset, 199 skeins of excellent linen yarn. Industry
    is the genuine source of all laudable pleasure. On it depend
    all the conveniences of life. Health, the greatest of
    blessings, depends on industry--beauty, on health. If
    ladies, then, wish to be beautiful, they must be
    industrious; they must animate their countenances with that
    blooming health which comes from the SPINNING-WHEEL. The
    fair sex, when rightly and industriously employed, are
    justly termed the beauty of this lower creation. Beauty
    without virtue is contemptible. Merit only gains the heart.
    Idleness is disgraceful. Industry is the ornament of wealth,
    the support and consolation of poverty. We hope soon to see
    the time, when the fair daughters of America will be clothed
    in the manufactures of their own hands. Happy are we, that
    some have already set the example. May it never be said,
    that American ladies rise 15 minutes later than the sun. May
    they ever have thread enough in their hands to make a halter
    for a Shays.

       *       *       *       *       *

    On Tuesday last, thirteen young ladies assembled, with their
    spinning-wheels, at the house of Mr. Joseph Whipple, in
    North-Providence, and, between the hours of eight in the
    morning and six in the afternoon, completed fifty skeins of
    excellent linen yarn.

                                                  July 1, 1788.

       *       *       *       *       *

    The spinning-wheel, a few years ago imprudently neglected,
    begins to be held in general reputation by the Fair; and the
    exploits of some on that useful machine, are deservedly
    celebrated, as worthy of imitation. To those good works of
    female industry may be added the singular attachment of two
    young ladies in Dighton, who spun, the 11th instant, between
    the rising and setting of the sun, thirteen skeins and
    eleven lees of good linen yarn; one six skeins and seven,
    and the other seven skeins and four lees. The spirit of
    industry is becoming more prevalent, especially among the
    fair sex. They begin to lay aside their useless and idle
    visits, or, at least, make them less frequent. When persons
    become more industrious and mind their own business, they
    talk less, and to better purpose; they become more
    contented, and the world around them is more peaceable and
    happy.

    PROVIDENCE, _May 24_. On the 7th inst. 71 ladies met at the
    house of the Rev. Mr. Ellis, in Rehoboth, and lodged 187
    skeins of good linen yarn, which they had spun for Mrs.
    Ellis; and others have since added 31. Solomon, in
    describing a virtuous woman, says, "She seeketh wool and
    flax, and worketh willingly with her hands.--She layeth her
    hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff."
    Industry is certainly a virtue, which, while it adorns,
    enriches, society; it banishes the languid hue from the
    countenances of the fair, and adds vigour and vivacity to
    the mind.--The spirited exertions that the daughters of
    Columbia are making, to manufacture our wool and flax, which
    are necessary for our consumption, are praise-worthy, and
    demand the approbation and assistance of every true patriot.
    We flatter ourselves with the pleasing expectation of seeing
    the virtuous fair clothed and ornamented in the genuine
    productions of their own labour.

       *       *       *       *       *

    We hear from Gloucester, that on Thursday last nearly thirty
    young ladies, inspired with the love of industry, asslembled
    at the house of Capt. Philemon Haskell, for the
    praise-worthy purpose of a Federal Spinning Match, when, to
    their honour, their spirited exertion produced 99 skeins of
    excellent yarn--practically declaring, that they neither
    laboured in vain or spent their strength for nought. The day
    thus industriously concluded, finished not the harmony of
    their federalism; in the evening, to crown the pleasure of
    the day, with additional company, they regaled with an
    agreeable dance, and, at a modest hour, parted in love and
    friendship, with hearts convivial as they met, leaving
    others to admire their female patriotism, and to go and do
    likewise.

    In Scotland, the farmers knit as well as the women of their
    families; but they do this while they are watching their
    sheep or cattle, or while they are sitting by their evening
    fire in winter. Why cannot our American farmers and their
    sons adopt this frugal practice? Time is the most precious
    thing in the world. Its very fragments should be saved.

       *       *       *       *       *

    PROVIDENCE, MAY 17. Monday last, eighteen young ladies
    assembled, with their spinning-wheels, at the house of
    Captain Jonathan Treadwell, and spun 40 skeins of good linen
    yarn.

    MAY 22. A correspondent desires us to mention, that at
    Johnston, a few days since, four industrious young ladies,
    by "laying their fingers to the spindle, and their hands to
    the distaff," completed, in one day, the spinning and
    reeling of 21 fifteen-knotted skeins of good linen yarn.
    Would to God, that the Gentlemen at the head of our
    political affairs in this State, were half so zealous in
    encouraging our own manufactures, as the fair sex are; who,
    at present, deservedly bear the palm, as friends to their
    country.

    "SPINNING BEE. On the 1st inst. assembled at the house of
    the Rev. Samuel Deane of this town, more than one hundred of
    the fair sex, married and single ladies, most of whom, were
    skilled in the important art of spinning. An emulous
    industry was never more apparent than in this beautiful
    assembly. The majority of fair hands gave motion to not less
    than sixty wheels. Many were occupied in preparing the
    materials, besides those who attended to the entertainment
    of the rest,--provision for which was mostly presented by
    the guests themselves, or sent in by other generous
    promoters of the exhibition, as were also the materials for
    the work. Near the close of the day Mrs. Deane was presented
    by the company, with two hundred and thirty-six,
    seven-knotted skeins of excellent cotton and linen yarn, the
    work of the day, excepting about a dozen skeins, which some
    of the company brought in ready spun. Some had spun six and
    many not less than five skeins apiece. She takes this
    opportunity of returning thanks to each, which the hurry of
    the day rendered impracticable at the time. To conclude and
    crown the day, a numerous band of the best singers attended
    in the evening and performed an agreeable variety of
    excellent pieces in psalmody. "The price of a virtuous woman
    is far above rubies, * * * She layeth her hands to the
    spindle and her hands hold the distaff."

When spinning-wheels ceased to be used altogether, we are not able to
say. Probably they were not in use for any great length of time after
the opening of the present century; but possibly in some country places
they were used down to the time of the War of 1812, and even later. We
are informed that in some remote places in Rhode Island and in Maine
spinning-wheels are in use to this day; but these are exceptional cases.

The "Massachusetts Centinel," April 30, 1788, has this advertisement:--

THE following very curious notice in the "Massachusetts Centinel" in
reference to funerals shows what had been customary upon such occasions;
the object of these "wholesome regulations" seemed to be to induce
economy. Gloves and rings were given to mourners in Salem to within the
last fifty or sixty years, and wines or liquors were also furnished.

                           _TAKE NOTICE._

    AN economical plan of mourning was adopted, before the
    Revolution, and its salutary effects have been experienced
    by almost every family in this town; since which those
    wholesome regulations have been passed into a law:
    Notwithstanding which, it has lately been broken in upon in
    several instances.--The _Inspectors of the Police_--that no
    one may hereafter plead ignorance, have caused the law
    respecting the same to be published, and give notice, that
    any future breach of it, will be prosecuted without any
    favour or affection.              _Boston, April 30, 1788._

       *       *       *       *       *

    _To prevent excess and vain expense, in Mourning, &c._

    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, That in future no scarfs, gloves or
    rings shall be given at any funeral in this town, nor shall
    any wine, rum, or other spirituous liquor, be allowed or
    given at, or immediately before or after, any funeral in
    this town, under pain that the person or persons giving,
    allowing or ordering the same shall respectively forfeit and
    pay the sum of _twenty shillings_ for each offence.

    _And it is further ordered_, That whatever male person shall
    appear or walk in the procession of any funeral in this town
    with any new mourning or new black or other new mourning
    coat or waistcoat, or with any other new black apparel, save
    and except a black crape around one arm, or shall afterwards
    on account of the decease of any relation, or other person
    or persons, put on and wear any other mourning than such
    piece of black crape around one arm, shall forfeit and pay
    the sum of _twenty shillings_ for every day he shall put on
    and wear or appear in the same.

    AND no female, of whatsoever degree, shall put on, wear or
    appear at any funeral in this town, in any other mourning or
    new black clothes whatever, other than a black hat or
    bonnet, black gloves, black ribbons and a black fan, on pain
    to forfeit and pay the sum of _twenty shillings_; and also
    forfeit and pay a like sum of _twenty shillings_ for every
    day she shall at any time at, or after such funeral, put on
    wear or appear in such new black clothes, as or for
    mourning, other than black hat, bonnet, black gloves, black
    ribbons, and a black fan as aforesaid.

In 1790 the town of Salem published in the papers some regulations about
funerals; among the fees fixed were these:--

    "For each Tolling of the Bell 8d."

    "The sextons are desired to toll the Bells only four strokes
    in a minute."

    "The undertakers service in borrowing chairs, waiting upon
    the Pall-holders and warning the Relations &c. to attend
    8/."

    "B. Daland and B. Brown are appointed by the Selectmen to
    see that Free Passages in the streets are kept open." (This
    was before carriages were used at funerals.)

                 MANUFACTORIES AND THE SPINNING
                            WHEEL.

    "The establishment of extensive manufactories, and the
    introduction of power-looms and spinning-jennies, has nearly
    destroyed the usual household manufactures, and put our
    other Jennies out of employment. Our ears are seldom greeted
    now a days in the farmer's cottage with the flying of the
    shuttle, or the deep base of the spinning wheel. We confess
    that we have looked upon their departure with a strong
    feeling of regret; and deem it no small abatement of the
    advantages, which the establishment of extensive
    manufactures has obviously yielded to the country, that it
    removes the daughter from the shelter and security of the
    paternal roof, and places her in a situation, which
    certainly furnishes no means of qualifying her for the
    proper department of woman; to preside over our domestic
    establishments; to perform her part in the joint labors of
    the household; and to know how and when and where to use,
    prepare, and to apply to the best advantage within doors,
    the products of man's labor without doors. Many occupations
    of female industry, strictly domestic however, of a healthy
    and agreeable nature, are constantly presenting themselves,
    so that there is little danger that the race of industrious
    women, and accomplished wives, at least among the country
    girls, will soon be extinct; and the silk culture, fast
    gaining ground among us, promises to furnish an unexhausted
    resource and a profitable employment of female labor."

In one of the numbers of the London "Spectator" for 1884 is an
interesting account of an attempt to revive the spinning-wheel industry
in England, through the kind offices of Mr. Albert Flemming, for the
purpose of helping poor women too old or blind to leave their homes for
other work. After considerable difficulty, a wheel was discovered among
a store of ancient articles; but no one at first knew how to use it.
Spinning was one of the lost arts, apparently. At length, however, an
old woman of eighty-four was found who understood the use of the wheel.
She taught Mr. Flemming how to spin. A few more old wheels were found,
and some new ones constructed. Then it was some time before a loom could
be discovered. Eventually this was accomplished, and the art of weaving
taught. The account says that twenty women who were unable otherwise to
obtain a living, are now busily at work, happy in being able to provide
for their families. They make, it may be added, a good strong, honest
linen, specimens of which have been presented to Mr. Ruskin. This
account is substantially from the "Living Age," Nov. 1, 1884.

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
