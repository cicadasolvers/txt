Dear Friends,

The Falls Church Village Preservation and Improvement Society (VPIS) is
pleased to be able to reprint _A Virginia Village_ by Charles A. Stewart
as part of its Centennial observance in 1985. We are especially grateful
to the Mary Riley Styles Public Library of Falls Church for permission
to use their copy of _A Virginia Village_ for the reproduction.

_A Virginia Village_ provides a snapshot of Falls Church at the turn of
the century, at a time when the predecessor of VPIS, the Village
Improvement Society (VIS) (pp. 16-18), was in full swing. Thus it is a
fitting backdrop to our year of special activities.

As you will note, many of the buildings and settings in the 1904 edition
have been lost or altered in the past 80 years. To make the book more
useful and enjoyable to current readers, we have added a Foreword,
Comments on the Structures Pictured, a Name and Street Index, and a
biographical sketch and photograph of the author. The new information is
not all inclusive and we invite you to cross-reference your reading with
the other sources listed in the Foreword.

The Society is indebted to several of its members who worked long and
hard to made this edition possible. In particular, we would like to
thank the chairman of the project, Colonel Merl M. Moore (a former VPIS
President); Mr. Edmund F. Becker, who wrote the Foreword; Mr. Henry H.
Douglas, who as usual is an indispensable resource on the history of
Falls Church; and Mr. Richard T. Allan, whose editing skills were
invaluable.

We hope this 1985 edition will become a cherished reminder of The
Society's 100th anniversary and a valuable edition to your personal
library. Sincerely,

  _President_

  Rowland Bowers
  _Vice President_

  Harold Silverstein

ABOUT THE FALLS CHURCH VILLAGE PRESERVATION AND IMPROVEMENT SOCIETY


In 1985, its Centennial Year, the Falls Church Village Preservation and
Improvement Society comprises over 750 citizens and businesses dedicated
to improving the quality of life in Falls Church.

The Society recognizes that it is the inheritor of the civic purposes
and activities of the Village Improvement Society (VIS) of Falls Church
established in 1885 and which group was modeled after the famous Laurel
Hill Association of Stockbridge, Massachusetts, and that VPIS' purposes,
objectives and activities represent a continuum of the earlier organized
and volunteer civic organization and effort to improve and preserve the
historic tradition, residential character, quality of life and
appearance of Falls Church, Virginia.

The values articulated by the founders in 1885 have not changed to the
present:

  to preserve the historic and predominantly single
  family detached residential and village character of Falls Church;

  to preserve its historic structures and landmarks;

  to promote architectural harmony and aesthetic values;

  to beautify the community by planting trees, flowers,
    and shrubs; and

  to work with governmental bodies and community groups
    to promote and fulfill these goals.

Archives of the Society may be found in the Virginia Room of the Mary
Riley Styles Library, Falls Church, Virginia.




FOREWORD


Charles A. Stewart's _A Virginia Village_ is a charming depiction of the
early days of Falls Church. It is the earliest attempt to put on paper
the story of the Falls Church area. In addition to interesting stories
about people and organizations and life generally in the small town of
80 years ago, the book contains photographs of 107 Falls Church houses,
stores, and churches then standing. Reading it is a trip into nostalgia
for old-timers--but the book is more than nostalgia. It pictures many
elements which we associate with the community's lovely historic
character and interest, and which intrigues newcomers and older
residents alike.

Charles A. Stewart produced the book with the help of friends, including
M.M. Ogden, who wrote the preface, and Pickering Dodge, who took the
photographs. Joseph H. Newell printed it in a small backyard shop owned
by his father, which was located on what is today North Washington
Street next to the Columbia Baptist Church.

Not all of the structures standing in the town of Falls Church in 1904
are pictured in _A Virginia Village_. Some owners perhaps were not
asked, or they did not wish to pay the two-dollar fee, or they declined
for other reasons. A number of these absent structures were well-known
features of the community, including the two W.&O.D. railway stations
(East and West Falls Church, now gone), Mt. Hope, Shadow Lawn (or
Whitehall), Tallwood, Jefferson School (no longer standing) and the old
I.O.O.F. Hall (also gone). _Falls Church--By Fence and Fireside_,
published in 1964 by the Rev. Melvin Steadman, mentions many others,
such as Big Chimneys, which was still standing in 1904.

Of the 107 structures pictured, 24 were located near the present City,
particularly in what was then known as the "East End" or East Falls
Church. This former part of the town of Falls Church was returned to
Alexandria County (now Arlington) in 1936. A large number of homes,
stores, and other business establishments which constituted East Falls
Church disappeared with the building of I-66, especially that part of
the highway that lies between Westmoreland and Sycamore Streets in
Arlington County. East Falls Church extended from the present
City/County line down Lee Highway, and thus was located on both the
north and south sides of I-66.

A review of the available records and the recollections of older
residents indicates that 57 of the buildings shown are no longer
standing; of the some 50 not pictured, 14 are no longer standing. Thus,
of at least 157 buildings known to have been standing in town in 1904,
71 are known to have been lost (almost half).

The sources consulted (other than the book itself) include extensive
notes made about 1970 by Mrs. John C. (Frances Butterworth) Cline, who
died in 1979; _Falls Church--Places and People_, by Henry H. Douglas,
published by the Falls Church Historical Commission in 1981 (still
available in paperback); Rev. Melvin Steadman's _Falls Church--By Fence
and Fireside_, published in 1964 (out of print); Henry H. Douglas'
_Falls Church Historical News and Notes_, published between May 1970 and
October 1972; Henry H. Douglas himself, who has made a hobby of Falls
Church history; Mel and Ruby Bolster, charter members of VPIS; and many
others.

While the City has lost much of its rural village character and charm,
and has meanwhile acquired some ugly modernity in spots, the City's
preservation ordinance, adopted in 1984, throws a protective cloak
against further demolition around structures built as residences prior
to 1911. Other buildings, such as churches and historic sites, are also
protected by the ordinance, subject to certification by the Historical
Commission to a Register. In addition, the Falls Church Village
Preservation and Improvement Society and others continually seek ways to
restore what aesthetic features have been lost.

Much additional information about houses, people and events in and
around Falls Church will be found in the publications mentioned above
and in other publications and documents making up the Falls Church Local
Historical Collection in the Virginia Room of the Mary Riley Styles
Public Library. The Collection is a veritable treasure-house of
historical information waiting to be explored, and anyone looking for
more information concerning any of the persons or places mentioned in
this book is urged to consult the Collection in the Virginia Room.

CHARLES ALEXANDER STEWART

Charles Alexander Stewart (1860-1950), who is best remembered in Falls
Church for his estimable little book, _A Virginia Village_, which was
published in 1904, was born at "Beechwood," the Stewart family farm at
the intersection of the Dismal Swamp and Northwest Canals. He was the
fourth in a family of five. His father, William Charles Stewart
(1810-1865), died at "Beechwood."

In 1887 Charles A. Stewart married Mary Isabella Tabb (1866-1939),
daughter of Dr. Robert Bruce Tabb (1833-1906) and Elizabeth Anne
(Warden) Tabb (1837-1891). Elizabeth Tabb Stewart, born in 1890, was the
eldest of ten children and lived in the family home in East Falls Church
from 1894 until 1971.

Mr. Stewart had a distinguished career in the United States Treasury
Department where he became chief clerk in the Office of the Comptroller
of the Currency, and was a bank examiner when he retired in 1930. He was
active in many community affairs. He was a vestryman of The Falls
Church, was chairman of the Falls Church School Board continuously from
1910 to 1927, was active in the creation of Madison School and, while he
was still living, the Charles A. Stewart Elementary School, on Underwood
Street, was named for him. He was a trustee of Oakwood Cemetery in 1918,
and was assistant secretary of the Arlington/Fairfax Savings and Loan
from 1933 to 1940.

COMMENTS ON THE STRUCTURES PICTURED

These comments provide information on the present status of the 107
structures pictured. They are arranged in sequence by item numbers,
which correspond to the page numbers in the original book, and repeat
the names exactly as given. The people named were the owners of the
structures pictured. Present street addresses are given when the
building is still standing. In the case of the 57 buildings now gone
(they are marked by asterisks), the former or present street address is
usually not known, and in such instances the approximate location is
given. When the date of destruction is known, it is given; when a
destruction date is not given, it presumably was some time prior to
1969, when the City's Architectural Inventory was prepared. Construction
dates and other interesting details are provided when known, in capsule
form.

Lawton Manor and Home Hill. Built in 1859 but renovated many times. Once
headquarters of Confederate Gen. James Longstreet and later the home of
Gen. Henry Ware Lawton. Formerly housed Mattie Gundry's "Gun-Well"
school. Yard formerly used by Louise and Ernest Shepard to hold the
first VPIS Attic Treasures sales. Threat to house stimulated formation
of VPIS in 1965. Owners: Donald Rice and Elizabeth Loker.

PREFACE.


In preparing this little book it has been the aim of the Editor to
obtain facts of the early history, as well as to set forth what changes
time has wrought in the erstwhile veritable hamlet of years gone by. To
this end he has exerted every effort in the examination of records, that
authentic data only, in describing the old church and village, may
appear in these pages. Aside from the descendants of the old settlers,
the heads of many households in the village of Falls Church have left
kindred and friends in other sections of the country, and identified
themselves heartily in the work of developing and beautifying the
natural advantages of the spot they have selected for the building of
new homes. It is but natural that interest should be taken in the
evidence of their thrift and enterprise, by those whose lives were
linked with theirs in times past, as in the town they have helped to
build up. The attempt has been to join the past with the present, in
reciting incidents of the early days, to show no less the improvements
that have come as the years roll on.

The joint work has been done by Messrs. Chas. A. Stewart, Pickering
Dodge and George M. Newell, Mr. Stewart having collected, edited and
compiled the text, Mr. Dodge the photographic work, and Mr. Newell the
printing.

The Editor is indebted for courtesies and assistance to Mr. H. H. Dodge,
Superintendent of Mount Vernon, a vestryman of Pohick Church, Mr. H. S.
Ryer, stenographer, Mr. F. M. Richardson, Clerk of the Court, Fairfax
Co., and Rev. George S. Somerville, Rector of the Falls Church. Valuable
information was obtained from Howe's History of Virginia, Snowden's Old
Landmarks in Virginia and Maryland, as from the Official Records of the
Union and Confederate Armies.

A Virginia Village.

Introductory.


Falls Church, while a Virginia village, is thoroughly cosmopolitan.
According to a recent census only about fifty per cent. of its
inhabitants are natives of Virginia, the rest coming from the various
States of the Union or from foreign countries.

Falls Church might properly be called a national village, since its
citizens are chiefly employees of the government, and the interests of
its eleven hundred people naturally center at the National Capitol.

Every geographical section of the United States has here a
representative type of citizen who has chosen this quiet village for a
home. For this and other reasons Falls Church is probably the most
thoroughly American community in the country. This distinction, if
admitted, must come as a natural sequence from its situation as a suburb
of the Nation's capital, from the cosmopolitan character of its society,
and from the fact that so many of its residents are connected with the
Executive Departments as a part of the machinery of representative
government.

The village is situated in a county of the Old Dominion rich in events
of historic interest. In Colonial days, in the times of the Revolution,
as in the days of the civil strife, Fairfax County furnished her quota
of illustrious sons. At Gunston Hall on the Potomac dwelt George Mason,
author of the Virginia Bill of Rights, pronounced the most remarkable
paper of the epoch, and the foundation of the great American assertion
of independence as afterward draughted by Jefferson. In Fairfax County
lived and died the immortal Washington, and his ashes repose in its
soil at his beloved Mount Vernon. During the late civil war every part
of its territory was a battle ground and breast-works thrown up by
contending armies over a generation ago may still be seen here and there
within its borders. At the beginning of our war with Spain twenty-five
thousand volunteer soldiers from a dozen States pitched their tents on a
favored spot in this ancient county, where they were schooled to
proficiency in the art of modern warfare.

The old Episcopal church, from which Falls Church takes its name, still
stands as a monument linking colonial days with the present. Around it
cluster memories of great events in American history, for past its
substantial walls have marched soldiers of all our leading wars since
the day Washington guided the lordly Braddock over the road hard by down
to the time of our recent war with Spain. The old church has passed
through many vicissitudes since Washington worshipped there. It served
as a recruiting station for patriots of the Revolution, then abandoned
as a house of worship for a long period of years; subsequently it was
reopened and throughout the civil war used alternately as a hospital and
a stable by the Union Army. To complete the chain of events in this
connection soldiers enlisted for the Spanish-American war were encamped
near by and pickets of the camp stood guard under the shadow of its
walls.

Falls Church thirty years ago was a mere hamlet of, perhaps, a dozen
houses. It is to-day the largest town in the county of Fairfax and its
population is steadily increasing. Forces are now at work which may
eventually make it the largest town in Northern Virginia, with the
possible exception of Alexandria. Upon the completion of the new bridges
now in course of construction across the Potomac and the improved
facilities for reaching Washington by means of steam roads and trolley
lines, the tide of suburban home-seekers from the capital city must turn
this way, whereby this Virginia village is destined to become a Virginia
city which may bind the old mother commonwealth closer than ever before
to the Federal City and the National government.




The Town of Falls Church.


Falls Church is an incorporated town of about eleven hundred
inhabitants. Endowed by State law with the name of town when a mere
hamlet, it is still "the village" to its citizens. It is situated on the
Bluemont branch of the Southern Railway 9 miles from Alexandria, and 45
miles from Bluemont at the foot of the Blue Ridge. An electric railway
connects it with Georgetown, D. C., 6 miles distant, and it is 13 miles
over the Southern Railway to the business center of Washington. Located
originally in Fairfax County its growing area has overlapped into the
adjoining county of Alexandria, taking within its corporate limits the
extreme southwestern part of what was at one time the District of
Columbia.

It is essentially a village of homes, nearly all of which are set in
ample grounds adorned with rare trees, well-kept lawns, and tasteful
shrubbery and hedges. Its fourteen miles of streets are bordered with
beautiful maples, and in summer the principal avenues are bowers of
living green.

Like the National Capital in its inception, Falls Church is a town of
magnificent distances. Within its corporate limits is room for ten
thousand people without overcrowding.

At an altitude of 300 feet above Washington, summer days here are
pleasant and summer nights cool and sleep-inducing.

The social atmosphere is most refined, and the moral tone of its
citizens cannot be surpassed. No saloons have been allowed in Falls
Church since its incorporation as a town thirty years ago.

The town has an excellent graded public school with a high class of
instructors, besides a number of private schools. Eleven churches,
including three for colored people just outside the town limits, afford
ample accommodation for all church-goers within a radius of many miles.
All the leading religious denominations are represented. The church
edifices are most creditable for a town of its size, and two are fine
examples of church architecture.

The history of Falls Church begins with the building of the old
Episcopal Church from which the place takes its name, but the town
itself is of modern growth. By a strange series of coincidences the old
church, as well as the town at a later period, has been in touch in
various ways with the National Government since Colonial days.
Washington was a vestryman and at times attended service here. It served
as a recruiting office for patriots of the Revolution. Dolly Madison
took the road for Leesburg leading past this church when fleeing from
the White House during the panic of the British invasion. Capt. Henry
Fairfax went forth with his company of Fairfax volunteers from the Falls
Church to the Mexican war and his body, borne home from far Saltillo,
found a resting place within its churchyard. Skirmishes between Union
and Confederate troops occurred all around its walls, and during the war
of '61 it served the purposes of a hospital for Union soldiers. To make
the chain of incidents complete, a farm near by was chosen at the
outbreak of the Spanish-American war as a training camp for United
States volunteer soldiers.

Few events of moment in government affairs can occur without directly
affecting some resident of Falls Church, since this little town has its
quota among the officers of the army and navy, in the rank and file of
the army, and on the forecastle of the man-of-war, to say nothing of a
full representation on the rolls of the several executive departments.
When the battle ship Maine was blown up in Havana harbor two jackies
from Falls Church were on board, fortunately escaping with their lives.
After Aguinaldo's capture by General Funston, it was a Falls Church man
who commanded the gunboat which conveyed the captive around the Island
of Luzon to Manila. The brave General Lawton, killed on the firing line
in the Philippine war, had so recently been a citizen of the town that
his death was deplored as a personal loss by his former neighbors.

About the middle of the last century there was a large influx of
settlers to Fairfax County from Northern New York and the New England
States, attracted by the milder climate and the cheaper lands then
offered for sale. Among the families who came about that period and
settled nearest the old Falls Church were the Baileys, Birches,
Barretts, Coes, Ellisons, Iveses, Lounsberrys, Munsons, Osbornes, Ryers
and Sherwoods--all familiar names, and many of them or their immediate
descendants now prominent residents of this village.

[Illustration: Mr. George G. Crossman]

Early in the seventies two government clerks drove over the rough and
hilly road from Washington and looked around the little hamlet of a
dozen houses scattered along the Leesburg turnpike from the old brick
church to the railroad station at West End. They were impressed with its
inviting hills as the ideal situation for country residences. The
excellent water from unlimited springs, the cool breezes and pleasing
prospect from the hilltops overlooking hot and dusty Washington in the
distance, persuaded them to make their homes in this ideal place. At
that time the railroad facilities to Washington were most unpromising.
The coaches were little better than the present freight car caboose, the
schedule was unreliable, the trains slow, and a change of cars had to be
made at the Alexandria junction. Such drawbacks did not deter these men
from carrying out their purpose of locating here. They decided to ride
or drive back and forth to their work in the department at Washington.
Others soon followed these pioneers, and a settlement of government
employees was the result. Many of those who followed the first two
pioneers were from New England. They were families for the most part
endowed with all those sturdy qualities of integrity, frugality and
piety, characteristic of their section, and soon the church of their
fathers stood within a stone's throw of the church of the early
Virginians.

Since the day our townsmen, Mr. Charles H. Buxton and Prof. W. W.
Kinsley, the pioneers of modern Falls Church, first settled here, the
increase of population has been slow, but it has been of steady and
sterling growth. The conservatism of the land-owners has given less
rapid growth than were its tone purely speculative. The population as
reported by the United States census for 1890 was 792; the census of
1900 gives the population at 1007, an increase of over 27 per cent.
during the ten years. The tax roll for 1903 shows property of taxable
value of $420,125, an increase of $149,040 over 1890.

Of all those who followed Messrs. Buxton and Kinsley to Falls Church,
who built homes and made the little straggling settlement at the
cross-roads the beautiful village it is to-day, space will not permit
even a brief mention. But there are a number of well-known citizens
still residing here who formed the nucleus of that "department colony"
of thirty years ago, and through whose influence in great measure this
village has become a settlement of government employees. Most prominent
among these settlers of the 70's who are connected with the executive
departments in Washington are Messrs. G. A. L. Merrifield and M. S.
Roberts of the Pension Bureau, Albert P. Eastman of the War Department
and George F. Rollins of the Treasury Department.

The rate of taxation levied by the town government is 60 cents on the
hundred dollars, 30 cents of which is for school purposes and 30 cents
for all expenses of the corporation. To this must be added the taxes
collected by the county of Fairfax, 75 cents on the hundred dollars,
making a total tax on property holders in the town of $1.35 on each one
hundred dollars of the assessed valuation. Property within the
corporation is exempt from county road tax and district school tax.
Property in that part of the village lying within Alexandria County is
assessed in like manner by the town and the authorities of the latter
county. The tax rate for Alexandria County for the year 1903 on the one
hundred dollars of assessed valuation of personal and real property was:
State tax, 35 cents; county levy, 40 cents, and for court-house
purposes, 10 cents--a total of 85 cents chargeable to the property
owners of East Falls Church, the section of the village in this county.
An additional tax of 50 cents for road purposes and 40 cents for the
district school is levied against taxable property in this county
outside of East Falls Church.

[Illustration: Mr. W. H. Nowlan]

When scarcely entitled to be designated by the name of village, the
little settlement on the Leesburg turnpike known as Falls Church was, by
an act of the General Assembly of Virginia, incorporated as a town. The
act in question was approved March 30, 1875, and on April 13 following
the new town began its career with the following officials duly
installed: Mayor, Dr. J. J. Moran; Clerk, H. J. England; Town Sergeant,
E. F. Crocker; Councilmen, Dr. J. J. Moran, George B. Ives, J. E. Birch,
T. T. Fowler, Isaac Crossman, J. J. Carter, Dr. L. E. Gott.

The act of incorporation was successively amended by the State
Legislature in 1879, 1890 and 1894. Sections 1 and 2 of the act of
incorporation as amended, approved March 2, 1894, read as follows:

SECTION 1. So much of the territories in the counties of Fairfax and
Alexandria, together with all the improvements and appurtenances
thereunto belonging, as is contained in the following boundaries,
to-wit: Beginning at the corner of Alexandria and Fairfax counties, on
J. C. DePutron's farm; thence to the corner of J. C. Nicholson and W. S.
Patton, in Mistress Ellen Gordon's line; thence to the corner of Sewell
and L. S. Abbott on the new cut road; thence to the corner of A. A.
Freeman and Mrs. Henry J. England on the Falls Church and Fairfax Court
House road; thence along centre of said road to centre of bridge over
Holmes Run; thence easterly in a straight line to the northwest corner
of the colored Methodist church on the road leading to Annandale;
thence easterly to the crossing of the Alexandria and Georgetown roads
at Taylor's corner; thence along the north line of said Georgetown road
to the corner of T. M. Talbott and Emma Taylor's estate; thence to a pin
oak tree near Dr. L. E. Gott's spring; thence to a stone on the property
of J. A. and Mrs. J. H. C. Brown, formerly the northeast corner of John
Brown's barn; thence to the crossing of Isaac Grossman's and Bowen's
line on the chain bridge road; thence to the place of beginning, is and
shall continue forever to be a body politic and corporate under the name
and style of the town of Falls Church, and shall possess and exercise
the rights and powers conferred on towns by the general laws of this
State and shall be subject to the restrictions and limitations imposed
by said law in so far as the provisions thereof are not in conflict with
the provisions of this act.

[Illustration: Mr. G. W. Poole]

SEC. 2. Be it further enacted. That the government of said town shall be
vested in a council of nine qualified voters, who shall be elected by
ballot on the fourth Thursday in May, eighteen hundred and ninety-four;
three of whom shall hold that office for one year, three for two years
and three for three years respectively, the same to be determined by
lot. The successors of the three whose terms expire each year shall be
elected annually on the fourth Thursday in May and shall hold their
offices for three years, or until their successors are duly elected and
qualified. The terms of office of all councilmen shall begin on the
first day of July of each year succeeding their election. Any person
entitled to vote in the magisterial districts of Falls Church or
Providence, in Fairfax County, or Washington magisterial district in
Alexandria County, and residing in said corporation and duly registered
by the town clerk, shall be entitled to vote at all elections for
councilmen. The town clerk and two members of the council whose terms of
office do not expire with that year, and who shall be designated by the
mayor, shall conduct such election between the hours of one and seven,
post meridian, and shall make return of the same to the mayor who shall
issue certificates, countersigned by the clerk, to those elected. Tie
votes shall be decided by lot, and contests shall be decided by the
council under the law governing contests for the county offices.

[Illustration: Mr. G. F. McInturff]

[Illustration: Mr. M. E. Church]

Section five provides that the council shall annually levy and collect
necessary taxes for roads, streets, school and corporation purposes,
which tax for all purposes shall not exceed sixty cents on one hundred
dollars without the consent of two-thirds of the resident freeholders of
the corporation. An amendment gives the council the privilege of levying
an additional tax of ten cents on the hundred dollars for the purpose of
establishing and maintaining a high school course in Jefferson
Institute, the public school, whenever requested by the town school
board.

Section eight provides that the "town sergeant shall be the executive
officer of the council, and shall have the authority, jurisdiction and
fees of a constable of Fairfax and Alexandria counties within and one
mile beyond the corporate limits. He shall, unless otherwise provided,
be the town treasurer and as such shall collect all taxes, fines and
licenses, and disburse the same upon the warrant of the council, signed
by the mayor and clerk."

[Illustration: Mr. J. W. Brown, Store and Residence]

The same section makes the sergeant overseer of roads and streets,
giving him the same powers as overseers of roads under the special road
laws of Fairfax and Alexandria counties, his compensation to be fixed by
the council.

Section nine provides that no district school tax and no district road
tax shall be assessed and collected, except by the council, on any
property within the corporation limits.

The last important section of the act of incorporation, which assures
the peace and quiet of this village, is the restriction placed upon the
liquor traffic. It reads as follows:

SEC. 10. That any person applying to the county of Fairfax or the county
of Alexandria for a license to sell liquors of any kind, either as a
keeper of an ordinary or eating house, or as a merchant, within the
corporate limits of the town of Falls Church in the said counties, or
within one mile beyond the limits of the said corporation shall produce
before the courts or boards having control of the issuance of licenses
for the sale of liquor of said counties a certificate of said council of
said town to the effect that the applicant is a suitable person and that
no good reason is known to said council why said license should not be
granted. And the courts of said counties or boards having authority
shall not grant the said license to sell liquors within the limits above
prescribed until and unless such a certificate be given. And under no
circumstances and in no event whatever shall the sale of liquors be
licensed in any part of the corporation where license for the sale
thereof has been prohibited under the provisions of chapter twenty-five
of the Code of Virginia, known as the local option law.

[Illustration: Mr. Geo. L. Erwin]

The town is divided into three wards and each ward is represented by
three councilmen.

THE BOARD OF HEALTH, appointed annually by the council, looks after the
health of the town, with authority to carry out such sanitary
regulations as may be deemed wise and expedient. The Board of Health for
the present year consists of Dr. T. C. Quick, Chairman, and Councilmen
John H. Wells and Elmer I. Crump.

THE FIRE DEPARTMENT of the village was organized in 1898. The officers
are a chief engineer and three fire wardens, one from each ward, and a
captain of the fire company. The equipment for fighting fires consists
of one fifty-five and two twenty-five gallon chemical engines of the
most approved pattern and one fully equipped hook and ladder truck. The
larger engine is kept in the central part of the village while the two
smaller ones are stationed at East Falls Church and West End
respectively. The officers are Chief Engineer, Dr. J. B. Gould; Fire

THE VILLAGE IMPROVEMENT SOCIETY, an important factor in the growth and
development of the village, was organized about twenty years ago. The
chief object of the society has been the improvement and adornment of
the streets and the fine shade trees which emborder the village
thoroughfares everywhere attest the fidelity of its members to the
object in view. In addition to the work of this character the society
has aided in various other ways in the work of improving the village
besides furnishing social entertainments for its members and friends.
About fifteen hundred dollars have been raised by the society and
disbursed to excellent advantage in securing substantial benefits to the
public weal.

[Illustration: Mr. E. C. Hough]

The Village Improvement Society was organized in the fall of 1885, the
first officers being Mr. W. H. Doolittle, President; Rev. D. H. Riddle,
Vice-President; Mr. S. V. Proudfit, Secretary and Mr. A. P. Eastman,
Treasurer.

This society was modeled after the famous Laurel Hill Society of
Stockbridge, Mass., and from a pamphlet published some years ago setting
forth its object we learn that its funds have been expended on roads,
sidewalks and street lamps, for a survey of the corporation, a piano for
the public school and other improvements at the school, for taking the
census and for Arbor Day expenses--a total expenditure up to that time
of about eight hundred dollars. The greater part of the money raised by
the society is from voluntary dues or the proceeds of lectures or other
entertainments. The funds raised in this manner are generally expended
through the town council or in conjunction with appropriations made by
that body.

The first observance of Arbor Day in the State was by the Falls Church
Village Improvement Society, when in 1892 this society instituted the
observance of the day by the public school. Since that date the society
has defrayed all Arbor Day expenses.

[Illustration: Major M. S. Hopkins]

By an ordinance of the town adopted February 8, 1904, the third Friday
in April of each year is designated as Arbor Day, to be observed under
the auspices of the Village Improvement Society for the planting of such
trees, plants or shrubs as it may desire.

The officers of the Village Improvement Society for the present year are
as follows:

President, M. E. Church; Vice-President, Franklin Noble, D. D.;
Secretary, Miss Belle Merrifield; Treasurer, George W. Hawxhurst;
Assistant Secretary, Dr. George B. Fadeley.

The meetings are held on the first Monday of each month, except July and
August, at the homes of the different members.

On these occasions after the adjournment of the business meeting, a
literary and musical programme is provided by the hostess of the
evening. Aside from the matter of business, the social part of these
gatherings is a distinct feature of the society, which serves to keep
alive the interest of its members, bringing together congenial friends
and giving "new-comers" an opportunity to become acquainted with their
neighbors.

PIONEER BUSINESS MEN. Among the most prominent business men of Falls
Church who located here about the time the place was incorporated as a
town, or soon thereafter, may be mentioned Mr. M. E. Church. Mr. Church
is a native of Vermont, and upon settling here engaged in the drug
business; he now conducts a successful real estate, loan and insurance
business. He is also connected with other important commercial
interests, and has been an indefatigable worker in promoting the welfare
of the village.

Mr. George W. Mankin, a native of this State, was one of the early
settlers in the village. He conducted a general merchandise business for
a long period of years, but at present is engaged in the drug business
with his son Mr. Geo. T. Mankin, under the firm name of George T. Mankin
& Co. Mr. Mankin has established as high reputation as a business man
and citizen as had his brother Mr. Charles Mankin, the well known dry
goods merchant, but recently deceased.

[Illustration: Mr. Nathan Banks]

Mr. Wm. M. Ellison, whose father was one of the early northern settlers
in this community, is a successful lawyer and real estate broker. Mr.
Ellison stands high as a business man and citizen, having served his
town as a councilman for many years past and as mayor of the town for
several terms. He was recently re-elected councilman from the West End
ward.

Among other prominent merchants who early settled here are Mr. J. W.
Brown, dealer in hardware and general merchandise, and Mr. George
Gaither, dealer in groceries.

Mr. Isaac Crossman, who came here from Pennsylvania soon after the civil
war, purchased for farming purposes a large block of land which is now
situated almost in the center of the village. The price paid was about
forty dollars per acre. A large part of this land has been divided into
town lots and sold. To indicate the increase in real estate values since
the war, the land of this Crossman property lying nearest the northern
boundary of the village sells for one thousand dollars and upward per
acre.

[Illustration: James A. Dickinson, M. D.]

FEW OLD HOUSES. Practically all the houses of the village are modern,
but there are a few old buildings of historic interest. Among these is
the Lawton house, at one time the residence of General Lawton. This
house was the headquarters of General Longstreet when the place was in
possession of the Confederates soon after the first battle of Manassas.
What was once known as the Star Tavern, now a grocery store, is a relic
of by-gone days. It flourished in the days before the railroad came, and
was a favorite stopping place for travelers over the road from the
mountains leading past its doors to the then important mart, Alexandria.
The place was kept during the civil war by W. H. Erwin, father of our
townsmen Messrs. Walter, George and Munson Erwin.

The old big chimney house situated in the field opposite the Odd
Fellows' Hall was built in Revolutionary times and is probably the
oldest dwelling in this vicinity. It is owned by the venerable John
Lynch, who was the sexton of the Episcopal Church for so many years
before and after the civil war. Mr. Lynch is now a resident of Maryland.

[Illustration: Dr. Geo. B. Fadeley]

THE COLORED SETTLEMENT. The colored people have a settlement a short
distance south of the town limits, consisting of probably a hundred
cottages with a population of between four and five hundred. They have
a school building and three churches and many of the little cottages and
surroundings indicate industry and thrift in the occupants.

HOTELS. The Falls Church Inn, where an old Virginia welcome awaits the
way-farer, accommodates transient and regular boarders. Besides there is
the "Evergreens," a large summer boarding place which has a high
reputation. There are numerous other homes, in or near the village,
where boarders are taken for the summer months.

NEWSPAPER. Falls Church has one newspaper published weekly, called "The
Falls Church Monitor." This paper was first established by Mr. E. F.
Rorebeck, under the name of "The Falls Church News." Mr. M. E. Church is
Editor and Mr. R. C. L. Moncure, General Manager.

[Illustration: Mankin Pharmacy]

EXCELLENT NATURAL DRAINAGE. Four Mile Run, traversing the northeastern
section of the corporation, separates the main part of the village from
all that portion lying in Alexandria County and known as East Falls
Church. This little stream empties into the Potomac four miles below
Washington, whence its name. Where it breaks through the hills at
Barcroft its water-power is used for milling purposes, as in the days
when General Washington's flour mills were situated at or near the same
point. The southern section of the village is drained by Holmes' Run,
which empties into the Potomac just south of Alexandria. The two rapid
little streams named take their rise a short distance to the west of the
village and afford ample drainage for all the territory embraced within
the corporation boundaries.

RAILWAY DEPOTS AND POST-OFFICES. Indicating the wide extent of territory
covered by Falls Church, it possesses two railway depots and three
independent post-offices. The Southern Railway's East Falls Church and
West End stations are one mile apart. The electric railway also has
stations and ticket offices near those of the steam road. The Falls
Church post office is on Broad street in the center of the village. East
Falls Church post office is located at the electric railway station and
West End post office at the West End steam railway station, the former
being one-half mile and the latter about one mile distant from the main
office.

[Illustration: Mr. Charles Crossman]

STREET LIGHTS. The village streets are now lighted by kerosene lamps,
but a movement is already on foot looking toward a better system of
street lighting and it is probable that an electric light plant will be
installed for that purpose within the near future.

A BANK IS NEEDED. The organization of a bank is being considered by a
number of enterprising citizens. There is already a sufficient amount of
banking business transacted by the residents of the village, which is
now divided among the banks located at Leesburg, Fairfax, Alexandria and
Washington, to make such an institution a paying investment from the
start.

THE PARK. Crossman Park, the densely wooded hill over which the electric
road runs from East End to West End, is an attractive spot to nature
lovers. Hundreds of old chestnut trees make it a favorite resort for
picnic parties in summer and nut-hunters in the fall. It is altogether a
charming piece of woodland without undergrowth, and needs no gravelled
walks or other evidences of the hand of man to add to its present
charm.

[Illustration: Dr. J. B. Hodgkin]

Near the park may be seen the stone which marks what was at one time the
western corner of the District of Columbia. It is situated on the land
of Mr. S. B. Shaw and is only a few yards from his residence. On the
west corner is chiseled "Virginia 1791," while on the opposite corner
the words "Jurisdiction of the United States" are still quite legible.

FALLS CHURCH TELEPHONE AND TELEGRAPH CO. The Falls Church Telephone and
Telegraph Company, of which Mr. M. E. Church is President and General
Manager, is connected with the lines of the Chesapeake and Potomac
Telephone Company of Washington and with the lines of the Southern Bell
Telephone and Telegraph Company.

The stations on this line include Alexandria, Arlington, Ash Grove,
Bailey's Cross Roads, Ballston, Barcroft, Belaire, Bluemont,
Chesterbrook, Clarendon, Chain Bridge, Colvin Run, Dunn Loring,
Dranesville, East Falls Church, Fairfax, Fort Myer Heights, Glencarlyn,
Hall's Hill, Herndon, Hamilton, Kenmore, Lewinsville, Langley, Leesburg,
Merrifield, Oakton, Paeonian Springs, Purcellville, Round Hill,
Rosslyn, Vienna, Wiehle, and West Falls Church. All stations are
equipped with Long-Distance Metallic Circuit Telephones.

[Illustration: Mr. D. O. Munson]

In addition to the telephone line Falls Church has two Western Union
Telegraph offices besides two express offices.

CAMP ALGER. Falls Church has gained a national reputation within recent
years by reason of the establishment near the village of the camp for
volunteer soldiers at the outbreak of the Spanish-American War. This
camp was one of several of the kind established in the Southern States
for the purpose of organizing an army for the invasion of Spanish
territory.

The farm of Mr. C. L. Campbell, about one and a half miles southwest of
the village was selected by the War Department for the army corps to be
assembled nearest Washington, and as soon as the contract was signed for
the lease of the property, troops from fourteen States were hurried here
as fast as recruited.

[Illustration: Mr. Henry Crocker Mr. E. F. Crocker]

The first troops on the ground were the District of Columbia Volunteers.
They were followed by those from Pennsylvania, and later came troops
from Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey,
Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, Kansas, Tennessee and
Virginia, all forming the Second Army Corps of the Spanish-American War.

The Second Army Corps was made up of the troops assembled at Falls
Church, to which Major General William M. Graham, U. S. V., was assigned
by orders of May 16, 1898. General Graham assumed command May 23, 1898,
announcing the official designation of the camp as "Camp Russell A.
Alger."

[Illustration: Mr. G. W. Mankin]

The strength of this army corps before the last of May consisted of 922
officers and 17,467 men. In June the number in camp was 1,103 officers
and 26,002 men; in July the strength of the corps was 1,183 officers and
29,747 men. In August the corps consisted of 1,347 officers and 33,755
men, the highest number in this corps before disbandment at the end of
the war.

By orders of May 24, the troops then on duty at this point were
organized into a First Division composed of three brigades of three
regiments each, and by orders of June 9, 1898, the Ninth Massachusetts
Volunteer Infantry and 33rd and 34th Michigan Volunteer Infantry were
constituted a separate brigade.

On June 9th the separate brigade mentioned was assigned as the First
Brigade, 3rd Division. On August 2, 1898, a second brigade was organized
composed of the First Connecticut Volunteer Infantry, and the Third
Virginia Volunteer Infantry.

The First Brigade, consisting of the Massachusetts and Michigan troops,
left Camp Alger for Santiago de Cuba on June 22 and 24, 1898. Troops of
the Second Brigade were returned to their States for muster out on
September 7 and 8, 1898.

The tents of the provost guard pitched at the electric railway terminus
at East End with pickets posted at various street corners made Falls
Church appear like a town under martial law. Under all the circumstances
the conduct of the troops was admirable. The homes of the citizens were
thrown open to the soldiers doing picket duty in the village, and the
ladies of the place vied with each other in contributing to the comfort
of sick soldiers at the camp.

[Illustration: Mr. C. H. Buxton]

The summer of 1898 was a most eventful one in Falls Church. No such
stirring scenes had been witnessed here since the days of the civil war.
Troop trains arriving or departing, drills at camp and practice marches
through the town, martial music from many bands, reveille and taps, all
contributed to impress the town folk with the fact that the country was
at war.

FINANCES OF THE TOWN. The expenses of the town government for the year
ending August 31, 1904, was $2,188.47. The assessed valuation of the
town is $420,125, which is about 50 per cent of the real value. The tax
levy for all purposes is six mills. The levy is divided as follows: For
corporation purposes three mills; for school purposes three mills. The
total receipts for fiscal year 1904 were $2,289.20.

There is no bonded indebtedness. A number of times propositions to bond
the town for school or street purposes have been voted upon but each
time the citizens have decided against incurring any bonded debt.

[Illustration: Mr. Summerfield Taylor]

The following are the officers of the town government:

OFFICERS OF THE TOWN. George N. Lester, Mayor; Henry Crocker, Clerk;
John N. Gibson, Sergeant; R. C. L. Moncure, Corporation Attorney.
Members of Council: 1st ward, Elmer I. Crump, S. E. Thompson, G. A.
Brunner; 2nd ward, E. A. Kimball, Geo. N. Lester, Geo. W. Hawxhurst; 3rd
ward, Thomas Hillier; Wm. M. Ellison, H. C. Birge. Committees, Street
Lamp Lighting: E. A. Kimball, Thos. Hillier, S. E. Thompson. Finance:
Wm. M. Ellison, Chairman, H. C. Birge, Geo. W. Hawxhurst. Board of
School Trustees: J. W. Brown, Chairman, R. J. Yates, Clerk, J. S. Riley.

HEALTH. In the matter of health Falls Church leads. Statistics obtained
by the U. S. Census Bureau relating to the mortality rate show that out
of 341 towns and cities from which returns were received the lowest
death rate for the year ending May 31, 1900, was in St. Joseph, Mo.,
with 9.1 for each 1,000 inhabitants, followed by Portland, Oregon, 9.5,
St. Paul, Minn., 9.7, and Minneapolis, Minn., 10.08. For the same period
there were only 5 deaths in Falls Church, its population then being
1,007. The average annual death rate in Falls Church is about 9.5 per
1,000, only 57 deaths having occurred here between August 17, 1898 and
September 2, 1904, a period of a little over six years.

[Illustration: Mr. A. P. Eastman]

The death rate in the United States for 1900, according to census
returns was 17.8 per 1,000, the rate in cities where such statistics
were gathered being 18.6, and in rural districts 15.4.



For the purpose of comparison the death rate per 1,000 in the following
cities as reported by the U. S. Census Bureau for 1900 will be of
interest. Baltimore, Md., 21.0; New York, N. Y., 21.3; Washington, D.
C., 22.8; Alexandria, Va., 24.2; Norfolk, Va., 25.2; Lynchburg, Va.,
27.7; Richmond, Va., 29.7; Petersburg, Va., 31.1.

IDEAL COUNTRY HOMES. To the generosity of a nearby nurseryman the town
is indebted for its wealth of trees. When the first streets were laid
out Mr. D. O. Munson donated liberally from his nursery stock and to him
is chiefly due the credit for the present attractive appearance of the
tree-lined streets.

The conventional arrangement of the average suburban town has not been
followed in laying out the streets of this village, and even the sinuous
main avenue, lined on either side by a row of full grown maples, adds to
its charm. Beyond the town to the westward the view of rolling plain
and delightful wooded expanse greets the eye, and in the distance the
smoky Sugar Loaf looms up to beckon one to mountain scenes. In an
afternoon drive from the village to the south or west the lover of
nature may find pleasure at every turn.

The healthfulness of Falls Church is proverbial, while its charming
situation, accessibility to the city of Washington and the homelike tone
pervading every part of its area have surprised and attracted all whose
privilege it has been to visit here for the first time. The place to the
tired city man can afford all the enjoyment of retirement and
tranquillity. With an abundance of green lawns, well shaded walks and
drives, pure water, churches, good schools and the necessary stores;
what more could the seeker desire to complete his ideal of a country
home.

[Illustration: Mr. Geo. F. Rollins]

Possessing advantages imperfectly pictured herein, Falls Church welcomes
the jaded fathers and mothers from the city to the place where children
may enjoy life with nature, where the climate, conducive to refreshing
sleep, soothes tired nerves and makes life to such again buoyant with
youthful hopes and joys.

[Illustration: The Old Colonial Church.]

The original church at the Falls is said to have been built in 1709.
This is only tradition, as no satisfactory evidence has been obtained
relating to its exact location or the date when first erected.

Court records establish the fact that there was a church on the present
site of the Falls Church in 1746. On March 20th of that year John
Trammell, in consideration of the sum of fifty shillings sterling,
transferred, by deed of bargain and sale, to the Vestry of Truro Parish
in Fairfax County a certain parcel of land containing two acres "where
the Upper Church now is." John Trammell owned at that time the greater
part of the land upon which the town of Falls Church is now situated. In
June, 1745, he leased to Walter English his plantation of 244 acres
"near the head of the north of Holmes' Run extending to Four Mile Run,
excepting two acres for the use of the church."

[Illustration: Mrs. C. E. Mankin's Store]

The vestry book of Truro Parish commences about 1732. This book is in
the possession of Mr. H. H. Dodge, of Mt. Vernon, a vestryman of old
Pohick Church. Through the courtesy of Mr. Dodge, the Editor was
permitted to make a careful examination of its pages, and to copy from
the minutes of the vestry meetings therein such entries as appeared to
throw any light upon the early history of the Falls Church.

Some apparently trivial entries have been copied, such as the payment of
a sexton's salary for a number of successive years, but the name of the
sexton in such cases has an important bearing upon the subject, when it
is not improbable that the churches indicated as the "Upper Church," the
"New Church," etc., may be the church later designated as "The Falls
Church."

[Illustration: Mr. Charles A. Stewart]

In addition to religious matters, the duties of the church vestry in
these early times embraced many secular affairs. Under the direction of
the Parish Vestry tithes were collected from the land owners, and
"processioners" were appointed by them to survey and establish all land
boundaries within the parish. Such matters as related to the relief of
the poor, the medical care of the sick, charges for burial of the dead,
the maintenance of the blind, the lame, and the maimed, also of
foundlings and vagrants, now looked after by the county government, were
then a part of the duty of the vestry of each parish.

By a general law passed in the Colony in 1667, Act IV, 19th Charles II,
the right was vested in the county courts, when expedient, to set aside
and appropriate not more than two acres of land for church and burial
purposes; ministers' salaries had been fixed the year before at 16,000
pounds of tobacco, or about $650.

As early as October, 1734, John Trammell was paid by the Vestry of Truro
Parish 320 pounds of tobacco for grubbing a place for a new church, for
which Robert Blackburn had drawn plans.

[Illustration: Mrs. Charles A. Mankin]

In November of the following year, Thomas or James Bennitt was paid 150
pounds of tobacco as sexton of the New Church. Record of the payment of
400 pounds of tobacco to James Bennitt, Sexton of the New Church,
appears under date of October 6, 1740, and again May 21, 1745. On the
latter date the Vestry decided to build a church "at or near the spring
nigh Mr. Hutchinson's on the mountain road ... with doors, windows &
seats after the manner of the Upper Church." The deed from Andrew
Hutchinson to the Vestry of Truro Parish for two acres of land upon
which this new church was to be erected, recorded in Liber A. No. 1,
page 464, Fairfax County Land Records, does not show this land to have
been in the vicinity of Falls Church.

On October 12, 1747, the vestry records indicate that Mary Bennitt was
sexton of the Upper Church, supposed to be the same which was called the
New Church before this date, and that Wm. Grove was sexton of the more
recently built church on the mountain road near Mr. Hutchinson's. Mary
Bennitt's salary as sexton of the Upper Church was 400 pounds of tobacco
until 1749, when it was increased to 460 pounds. Her salary was again
raised to 560 pounds in 1752, and so continued until 1755, when James
Palmer became sexton at "Falls Church," so designated in the records.
James Palmer appears to have been succeeded by Gerard Trammell, the
Vestry at a meeting held November 12, 1759, having allowed the latter
560 pounds of tobacco as sexton of Falls Church.

[Illustration: Mrs. Annie Eells]

In February, 1749, the Vestry decided to build an addition to the "Upper
Church," and the contract for the improvement was given to Charles
Broadwater, Gent., who undertakes to complete the work by the laying of
the next parish levy for the sum of 12,000 pounds of tobacco. Mr.
Charles Broadwater was at that time one of the vestrymen, and among
those present at the meeting were George Mason and the Rev. Charles
Green. The vestry meeting held October 25, 1762, elected George
Washington a Vestryman in place of Wm. Peake, Gent., deceased, and at
the same meeting it was ordered that the sexton at Falls Church be
allowed 560 pounds of tobacco for his services.

The Vestry of Truro Parish met on March 28, 1763, at the Falls Church.
Those present were: Henry Gunnell, Wm. Payne, Jr., Church Wardens; John
West, Wm. Payne, Charles Broadwater, Thomas Wren, Abraham Barnes, Daniel
McCarty, Robert Boggers and George Washington.

[Illustration: "Eastover" Mr. Pickering Dodge]

It appears that this meeting was called for the purpose of deciding
whether to repair the old church, then greatly in decay, or to erect a
new building. It would seem that the matter of abandonment of the site
of the old church was also to be acted upon, and the erection of a new
one in a more convenient place.

The Vestry decided that the old church was too dilapidated to repair,
and resolved that a new church be built at the same place. It was
ordered that the Clerk of the Vestry advertise in the Virginia and
Maryland Gazettes for workmen to meet at the church on the 29th of
August next following, to undertake the building of a brick church, to
contain 1,600 feet on the floor, with a suitable gallery. The record of
the vestry meeting of October 3, 1763, shows that 30,000 pounds of
tobacco had been levied toward building Falls Church, and was to be sold
by the Church Wardens for the best cash price obtainable. George
Washington was not present at this meeting; but as an evidence of his
interest in the contemplated improvements he copied in his diary under
date of 1764 the advertisement published in the Maryland Gazette for
"undertakers to build Falls Church."

[Illustration: Mr. W. A. Ball]

The accounts of the Clerk of the Vestry at this date show Truro Parish
credited with 1,807 tithables at 37 pounds of tobacco each, or a total
of 66,859 pounds. The expenditures debited against this amount include
17,280 pounds of tobacco for salary of minister, 560 pounds each to the
sexton at Pohick Church and Falls Church, 500 pounds to the sexton at
Alexandria, 3,000 pounds to Clerk of Vestry, besides sundry payments
toward the support of the indigent of the parish.

The record of the vestry meeting for Truro Parish April 26, 1765, states
that Truro Parish has been divided from Colonel Washington's mill to
John Monroe's and thence to Difficult Run, the upper parish being called
Fairfax. The Parish of Fairfax in which was situated Falls Church or the
"Upper Church" and Alexandria or the "Lower Church" was created February
1, 1765, by virtue of an Act passed the previous year, being the 4th
George III. Falls Church was evidently the Parish Church, and Alexandria
"The Chapel of Ease" as indicated by the comparative emoluments of the
office of sexton.

[Illustration: Mr. T. B. Snoddy]

Earnest efforts have been made to locate the Vestry Book of Fairfax
Parish containing information relating to Falls Church after the
division of Truro Parish in 1765. This book was in charge of the rector
of Christ Church, Alexandria, at the outbreak of the civil war and is
supposed to have been lost or destroyed.

A few facts relating to Falls Church have been gathered from an address
delivered by the rector of Christ Church in 1873 upon the occasion of
the 100th anniversary of the consecration of the latter church.

The Vestry elected for Fairfax Parish March 28, 1765, consisted of the
following: John West, Charles Alexander, William Payne, John Dalton,
George Washington, Charles Broadwater, George Johnston, Townsend Dade,
Richard Sanford, William Adams, John Posey, Daniel French.

Rev. Townsend Dade, ordained by the Bishop of London in 1765, was the
first minister of Christ Church, and it is presumed that as minister of
the Parish he also officiated at the Falls Church. His salary was 17,280
pounds of tobacco, and 2,500 pounds were added to this for the
deficiency of a glebe. He served as minister until 1778.

[Illustration: Dr. T. M. Talbott]

In November, 1766, the Vestry ordered a levy to be made upon the
inhabitants of the parish of 31,185 pounds of tobacco, for the purpose
of building two new churches of brick; one at the Falls, the other at
Alexandria.

The new brick church which the Vestry decided to erect in place of the
old wooden structure was built, according to reliable information, by
Mr. James Wren, for about 600 pounds sterling. Bishop Meade states in
his book on old churches of Virginia, that a most particular contract
was made for him as also for James Parsons, the contractor for the
Alexandria church.

The mortar was to be two-thirds lime and one-third sand; the shingles
were to be of the best cypress or juniper and three-quarters of an inch
thick. The contract for building Falls Church called for a gallery, but
this was never put in.

The Alexandria church was begun in 1767 by James Parsons, 600 pounds
sterling being the contract price. Parsons failed to complete his
contract and the building was finished for an additional sum of 220
pounds sterling by Col. John Carlyle, and formally delivered February
27, 1773.

[Illustration: Mr. C. L. Blanton]

In 1770 a tract of about 500 acres was purchased from Daniel Jennings at
15 shillings per acre, and upon this in 1773 the Fairfax Vestry caused
to be erected a glebe house, or rectory, with a dairy, meat house, barn,
stable and corn house for 653 pounds sterling.

During the Revolutionary War, Falls Church is said to have been the
recruiting headquarters of Col. Charles Broadwater, one of Fairfax's
first patriots.

In 1775 there were in Virginia 95 parishes, 164 churches and chapels,
and 91 clergymen. At the conclusion of the war for Independence only 72
parishes remained, and 34 of these had been deprived of ministerial
help. Churches and chapels had gone to ruin; soldiers having turned them
into barracks or stables.

In 1778 the Rev. Mr. Dade was succeeded as Parish minister by the Rev.
Mr. West, who served for a few months, and he in turn was succeeded by
Rev. David Griffith who it is recorded exercised his ministry with
fidelity in his Parish, preaching both at Alexandria and at Falls Church
from 1780 to 1789. He had been chaplain in the 3rd Virginia Regiment
during the revolution and was to the time of his death, in 1789, a close
personal friend of Washington.

From 1790 to 1792 Rev. Bryan Fairfax directed the affairs of Fairfax
Parish, selecting for his assistant Rev. Bernard Page. Before the
revolution, being an ardent royalist, he endeavored to dissuade from the
war with the mother country his friend George Washington whose
confidence and esteem he continued to enjoy to the last. Bryan Fairfax
was the son of William Fairfax of Belvoir. He was ordained to the
ministry in 1786 by Bishop Seabury. His title as Eighth Lord Fairfax was
confirmed to him by the English House of Lords in 1800.

The civil functions of the Vestry ceased in 1784. Thereafter, in the
struggle following the disestablishment, having to depend upon voluntary
contributions, many churches succumbed.

It was about this period, or not long after the death of Dr. Griffith in
1789, that Falls Church was abandoned as a place of worship, fell into a
state of dilapidation, and was not used for many years. Chiefly at the
expense of Henry Fairfax, grandson of Rev. Bryan Fairfax, formerly its
rector, the building was repaired and young Mr. Minor, as a lay reader,
organized a congregation of worshippers.

In 1827 Bishop Meade visited this church and the description of it in
his book "Old Families and Churches of Virginia" will be of interest.

"The exercises of the Seminary being over, I next directed my steps to
the Falls Church, so called from its vicinity to one of the falls on the
Potomac River. It is about eight miles from Alexandria, and the same
from Georgetown. It is a large oblong building, and like that near Mount
Vernon, has two rows of windows, being doubtless designed for galleries
all around, though none were ever put there. It was deserted as a house
of worship by Episcopalians about forty years ago. About that period,
for the first, and it is believed for the last time, it was visited by
Bishop Madison. Since then it has been used by any who were disposed to
occupy it as a place of worship, and the doors and windows being open,
itself standing on the common highway, it has been entered at pleasure
by travellers on the road and animals of every kind. Some years since,
the attention of the professors of our Seminary, and of some of the
students was drawn towards it, and occasional services performed there.
This led to its partial repair."

[Illustration: Mr. C. C. Walters]

Bishop Meade in this account of his visit to the old church states that
he visited the same day an interesting school for young ladies at Capt.
Henry Fairfax's where he delivered an address to the students. This
school was located near Fairfax Court House. Mrs. Chichester, widow of
the late Major John H. Chichester and a communicant at the present time
of Falls Church, was a pupil of this seminary before the death of Capt.
Fairfax, and recalls the incidents connected with his death in the
Mexican War and his burial near the old church door 57 years ago.

From the time Bishop Meade preached in the old church in 1827 to the
beginning of the war of 1861 much that might be of interest is lost with
the records of the Parish.

The damage to the church by soldiers during the civil war was later
repaired at the expense of the United States Government at a cost of
about $1,300. None of its ancient furniture has been preserved, the gray
stone urn-shaped baptismal font alone remaining.

[Illustration: Mr. J. W. Garner]

The rectors of Falls Church since the civil war have been Bishop Horatio
Southgate, Rev. John McGill, Rev. Frank Page, Rev. J. Cleveland Hall,
Rev. R. A. Castleman, Rev. Dr. John McGill again, and the present rector
Rev. George S. Somerville.

The present vestry book begins November 27, 1873. The vestrymen for the
year 1904 are S. D. Tripp, S. W.; J. T. Unverzagt, J. W.; C. A.
Marshall, Wm. E. Parker, A. H. Barbor, E. A. Ballard.

In connection with the name, it may be of interest to state that,
previous to the Revolution, there being no bishop in Virginia, church
buildings were not consecrated, generally being called after the parish
in which situated, or from some other geographical name; hence the New
Church, the Upper Church, the Falls Church. The simple name suggesting
only its location as first bestowed upon the church near the Falls has
now, after the lapse of years, become irrevocably fixed. Around it
cluster so many memories of the early days that the name "Falls Church"
must continue unchanged to the last.

     March 28, 1763:

     At a Vestry of Truro Parish held at the Falls Church March 28,
     1763; present: Henry Gunnell, Wm. Payne, jr., Ch. Wardens; John
     West, Wm. Payne, Chas. Broadwater, Thos. Wren, Abra. Barnes, Dan'l
     McCarty, Robt. Boggers, and Geo. Washington; who being there met to
     examine into the state of the said church, greatly in decay and
     want of repair, and likewise whether the same shall be repaired or
     a new one built, and whether at the same place or removed to a more
     convenient one, and likewise to view the addition built by Mr.

Falls Church in the Civil War.


In May, 1861, the Union troops moved into Virginia and occupied
Arlington Heights and Alexandria. On June 1 an engagement at Fairfax
Court House between a company of Union cavalry and Confederate troops
resulted in the loss of six Union and twenty Confederate soldiers. The
Union forces under General McDowell occupied the town of Fairfax about
the middle of July, inaugurating the first Bull Run Campaign. The battle
of Bull Run was fought July 21, 1861.

After the first battle of Bull Run, a systematic plan for the defense of
the National Capital began to take shape. At that time the commanding
heights four miles west of Alexandria and six miles from Washington were
occupied by the Confederates, Falls Church being the headquarters of
General Longstreet.

In October, 1861, the hills were again taken possession of by the Union
troops. The system of works for the defense of Washington on the south
began with Fort Willard below Alexandria, and terminated with Fort Smith
opposite Georgetown, comprising in all twenty-nine forts and eleven
supporting batteries, besides Forts Ethan Allen and Marcy at the
Virginia end of Chain Bridge, with their five batteries of field guns.

[Illustration: Mr. Charles A. Marshall]

Falls Church was the most advanced post of General McDowell's corps,
when on August 3, 1861, a correspondent of Harper's Weekly writing from
here to that paper described the old Church as it appeared at the
beginning of the Civil war as follows:

"On this page we illustrate Fall's Church, Fairfax County, Virginia,
from a sketch by our special artist with General McDowell's 'corps
d'armee.' This is the most advanced post of our army in Fairfax County,
and has been the scene of several picket skirmishes. Falls Church was
built in 1709, and rebuilt, as an inscription on the wall informs us, by
the late "Lord" Fairfax, whose son, the present "Lord" Fairfax, is
supposed to be serving in the rebel army. The title of "Lord," we may
observe, is still given to the representative of the family. The
inscription on the old church reads as follows:

[Illustration: Mr. John S. Garrison]

'Henry Fairfax, an accomplished gentlemen, an upright magistrate, a
sincere Christian, died in command of the Fairfax Volunteers at
Saltillo, Mexico, 1847. But for his munificence this church might still
have been a ruin.'

Service was held in the old church two Sundays since, Rev. Dr. Mines,
Chaplain of Second Maine Regiment, officiating, and most of the troops
in the neighborhood being present."

Captain Henry Fairfax, to whose memory the tablet alluded to was placed
in the old church, was a graduate of West Point. At the outbreak of the
Mexican War, he organized a company called the Fairfax Volunteers
sailing to Mexico with the regiment of Virginia volunteers under command
of Colonel John F. Hamtramck. Upon arriving in Mexico, Captain Fairfax
fell a victim to the climate and died at Saltillo, August 16, 1847. His
body was brought home and buried near the church he loved so well, and
it is thought that the grave which may be seen in the foreground of the
war-time picture of the church on page 62 may be his. The tablet to his
memory has long since been destroyed, and every vestige of his
tombstone has disappeared, but nature, not forgetting his generous gifts
to the old church, has sent up a spire-shaped cedar to mark his grave.
Colonel Hamtramck died April 21, 1858, at Shepardstown, Va.

[Illustration: Mr. F. A. Niles]

The damage to the old church, according to one of the oldest citizens of
the town, Mr. George B. Ives, was done by a company of Union cavalry on
picket duty under command of a captain of the regular army. He permitted
his men to tear out the floor of the church and use it for a stable. The
building might have been damaged beyond repair had it not been for Mr.
Ives and the late Mr. John Bartlett, who reported the matter to General
Augur, the Military Governor of this district, by whose orders the
captain was arrested and further desecration prevented.

About three miles from Falls Church, on the Alexandria turnpike, is
Bailey's Cross Roads, where in November, 1861, President Lincoln
reviewed the Union forces preparatory to the Peninsular Campaign.

The story of the most important events occurring during those stormy
times around the old Colonial church is best told by the "Official
Records of the Union and Confederate Armies," extracts from reports
therein following:

SKIRMISH AT MUNSON'S HILL AUGUST 31, 1861.

Report of Colonel Geo. W. Taylor, 3rd N. J. Infantry, dated September 2,
1861.

GENERAL: The pickets of the enemy having for some time been extremely
annoying to outposts on Little River Turnpike and on the road leading
from thence to Chestnut Hill, I decided on making a reconnaissance in
person with a small force with the view of cutting them off. Accordingly
I marched with 40 men, volunteers from 2 companies of my regiment, on
the morning of Aug. 31, at 3 a. m., and keeping to the woods arrived
soon after daylight at or near the point, a little beyond, at which I
desired to strike the road and cut them off.

[Illustration: Miss Ellen W. Green]

Here we were obliged to cross a fence and a narrow corn field where the
enemy, who had doubtless dogged our approach through the woods, lay in
considerable force.

While in the corn we were suddenly opened upon by a rapid and sharp fire
which our men, whenever they got sight of the enemy, returned with much
spirit. Scarce two minutes elapsed when I found 3 men close to me had
been shot down. The enemy being mostly hid, I deemed it prudent to order
my men to fall back to the woods, distant about 30 yards, which I did.

At the same time I ordered enough to remain with me to carry off the
wounded, but they did not hear or heed my order except two. With these
we got all off, as I supposed, the corn being thick, but Corporal Hand,
Co. 1, who, when I turned him over, appeared to be dying. I took his
musket, also the musket of one of the wounded and returned to the woods
to rally the men. I regret to say that none of them could be found, nor
did I meet them until I reached the blacksmith shop, three-quarters of a
mile distant.

Here I found Capt. Regur, Company I, with his command. Re-enforcing him
with 25 men of the picket, then in charge of Capt. Vickers, 3rd regiment
N. J. volunteers, with the latter he immediately marched back to bring
in Corporal Hand, and any others still missing. He reports that on
reaching the ground, he found the enemy in increased force, and did not
re-enter the corn field, in which I think he was justified. I should
have stated that quite a number of the enemy were in full view in the
road when we jumped the fence and charged them, and that each man in the
charge, Capt. Regur leading by my side, seemed eager to be foremost; nor
did one to my knowledge flinch from the contest until my order to fall
back to the woods, which fortunately they misconstrued into a continuous
retreat to our pickets. The enemy seemed to have retreated very soon
after, as the firing had ceased before I left.

[Illustration: Mr. Jno. D. Payne]

The 3 wounded men are doing well except one. As near as I can ascertain
there were 3 of the enemy shot down.

The whole affair did not last 10 minutes.

The officers with me were Capt. Regur, Co. I, 1st Lieut. Taylor and 2d
Lieut. Spencer, both of the same company.

All of which I have the honor, respectfully to report.

                                   GEO. W. TAYLOR,
                         Colonel, 3rd Regiment N. J. Volunteers

                                   BRIG. GEN. P. KEARNY,
                                    Commanding Brigade.

Sept. 12, 1861: Longstreet states that Colonel Stuart has been at Munson
Hill since its occupation by the Confederate troops; that he had driven
the enemy from Mason's, Munson's and Upton's Hills.

Sept. 25, 1861: Reconnaissance at Lewinsville and skirmish near that
place with Stuart's cavalry. Union force 5,100 infantry, 16 pieces of
artillery and 150 cavalry, under Brig. Gen. Wm. F. Smith, commanding at
Chain Bridge.

Sept. 25, 1861: Report of General J. E. Johnston, Headquarters Army of
Potomac to Secretary of War, Richmond, states that an advance guard of
11 regiments of infantry and Colonel Stuart's calvary is stationed at
Falls Church, Munson's and Mason's Hills, at Padgett's and at
Springfield Station on the Orange and Alexandria Railroad in a strong
defensive position.

[Illustration: Dr. L. E. Gott]

Sept. 28, 1861: Affair at Munson's Hill, near Vanderburg's House. Union
force attacked at night on march to Poolesville. Lieut. Col. Isaac J.
Wistar, Commanding California Regiment, reported 4 killed and 14
wounded.

Nov. 16, 1861: In General Orders No. 45, Headquarters Army of Potomac,
Major General McClellan gave Fort on Upton's Hill name of Fort Ramsay.

Nov. 18, 1861: Skirmish on road from Falls Church to Fairfax Court
House, about a mile south of Falls Church, between a detachment of 1st
Va. Cavalry under Lieut. Col. Fitz Lee, and 14th N. Y. S. M., under Lt.
Col. E. B. Fowler. Union loss 2 killed, 1 wounded, 10 missing.
Confederate loss, Private Tucker killed and John C. Chichester, Lee's
guide, mortally wounded; 2 slightly wounded. Col. Lee's horse killed
under him during action.

Sept. 2, 1862: Skirmish near Falls Church. F. J. Porter, Major General
Commanding, Headquarters Army Corps, Hall's Hill, in his report to
General Marcy states that a battery supported by cavalry suddenly
appeared on Barnett's Hill and opened fire upon Pleasanton at Falls
Church, while dismounted cavalry fired upon and killed 3 of his mounted
pickets, who, armed only with sabers and pistols, could not contend with
the enemy protected by timber. Pleasanton replied with his battery but
the shots fell very short. The enemy supposed to have come from
direction of Hunter's Mill returned toward Vienna. He states that the
country beyond his picket lines affords every facility for such attacks,
and that the commanding general must expect them to be frequent so long
as the enemy continues in large force in his front and wishes to divert
attention from other movements, that from the opposite hills his camp
and movements are open to view of the enemy.

[Illustration: Mr. R. J. Yates]

Sept. 4, 1862: Brig. Gen'l A. Pleasanton from his camp near Fort Albany,
Va., in his report to Brig. Gen. R. B. Marcy, chief of staff, written at
5 a. m., states that he is about to be off with the sixth cavalry and
two other companies for Falls Church where he expects to make his
headquarters and from whence he will scout as directed. He suggests
that the telegraph be extended to Falls Church and asks that supplies
for his command be forwarded by railroad to a point opposite Falls
Church.

[Illustration: Mr. S. A. Copper]

At 8:30 a. m., his message states that from reports received by him, the
impression is that the enemy is going to cross the Potomac at Walker's
Landing.

At 12: 45 p. m., he reports from Falls Church that the enemy's advanced
pickets, on the Leesburg and Georgetown turnpike are three-fourths of a
mile this side of Difficult Creek, and that a regiment of Mississippi
cavalry, the Jeff Davis Legion, is at the bridge over the creek.

At 1:30 p. m., from Falls Church his dispatch to the chief of staff
states that the squadron on the Vienna road reports the enemy to be
approaching from that direction in some force; that one of his men had
been badly wounded in a skirmish. Gives it as his opinion that the enemy
is only making a show of force to conceal his movements on the upper
Potomac.

Sept. 4, 1862: Major General F. J. Porter from Headquarters Fifth Army
Corps at Hall's Hill, sends a message at 4:30 p. m., to Major Gen'l
McClellan stating that Gen'l Morell from Minor's Hill reports that the
enemy has begun an attack on the Union pickets, with artillery, infantry
and cavalry.

[Illustration: Mrs. J. L. Auchmoody]

Sept. 4, 1862: At 6:45 p. m., from Upton's Hill, Brig. Gen'l J. D. Cox,
commanding division, makes the following report to A. V. Colburn, Ass't
Adjutant General:

"The firing upon General Pleasanton's command was from, possibly, three
pieces of light artillery. The small-arm fighting was confined to the
head of the enemy's column, deployed as skirmishers, with some
dismounted men or infantry, it is not certain which. The pickets of
Pleasanton's command, Eight Illinois and Eight Pennsylvania Cavalry,
skirmished with them. We lost 2 men shot. The force of the enemy did not
come beyond the edge of the woods, one and a half or 2 miles above Falls
Church, and no large numbers were actually seen. The reports sent by
General Pleasanton were necessarily those brought in by his men. A
regiment of cavalry, with two light pieces, rapidly handled, would
account for all the demonstration I could see with my glass, but there
may have been more. General Pleasanton's cavalry being ordered away, we
shall not have cavalry to scout the country till General Buford arrives.
Scouts report all quiet toward Fairfax and Little River pike."

Aug. 16, 1863: Skirmish at Falls Church; no circumstantial reports on
file.

June 23-24, 1864: Skirmishes near Falls Church and Centreville, Va.
Extract from report of Col. Charles R. Lowell, Jr., 2nd Mass. Cavalry,
commanding cavalry brigade. Headquarters cavalry brigade near Falls
Church, Va., June 24, 1864.

A patrol from the camp of 16th N. Y. Cavalry consisting of 4 men was
fired upon last evening between the pike and the railroad by a party of
about 10 men and 2 of the patrol captured; the other two brought word to
Annandale, and Col. Lazelle sent out a party of 40 men under Lieut.
Tuck, 16th N. Y. Cavalry in search of attacking party. Party halted one
and a half miles beyond Centreville to feed. Party of about 60 of the
the enemy dashed in upon them. Men demoralized and panic stricken
scattered in all directions. Lieut. Tuck only one as yet, 6 p. m., who
has reached camp; remainder either wounded, prisoners, or straggling.
After Tuck had been sent out a citizen reported to Col. Lazelle that he
had been stopped by Mosby last evening near Centreville and detained
under guard till morning, and that he had seen small parties numbering
about 100 men. Col. Lazelle, upon receiving this information, sent out
150 men to support Tuck under Major Nicholson. This party started at 8
a. m. At 2 p. m., Tuck returned, reporting attack as above at 11 a. m.
He was started by Col. Lazelle with a party of 15 men to overtake party
of 150 and put them on trail. Major Forbes with 100 men and ambulances
has been sent out this evening to place of surprise to pick up
stragglers and any wounded, and support Major Nicholson if Mosby's force
is reported more than 60 men.

[Illustration: Mrs. C. Larner]

June 25, 1864, 11 a. m.: Major Forbes just returned from Centreville and
a clearer account of affairs can be given. Mosby with 200 men came down
Thursday evening to near Union Mills and an iron gun drawn by 6 horses.
Squad of Kincheloe's men took 2 of Col. Lazelle's patrol. Mosby returned
to Union Mills Friday morning and marched his column back through

Churches and Societies.


THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH. One of the most attractive church edifices in
the village of Falls Church is the Presbyterian Church, a picture of
which is shown on page 5.

It was built in 1884, being formally dedicated in October of that year.
The building now used by the Sunday School of the church, which was
built before the civil war by Dr. Simon J. Groot, as a hall for
religious and secular public meetings, was purchased and formally
dedicated as a church November 20, 1866.

Since that date the pastors have been Rev. H. P. Dechert, who resigned
in 1870, Rev. David H. Riddle, Rev. D. L. Rathbun and Rev. R. A.
Davison, D. D.

The Rev. Mr. Riddle's pastorate extended over a period of seventeen
years, and it was during his term that the present handsome stone church
was built.

The Rev. Mr. Rathbun was pastor from 1890 to 1900.

[Illustration: Mr. J. W. Seay]

The church has a large membership and the congregation continues to
increase.

The Sunday School connected with the church, of which Mr. E. C. Hough is
Superintendent, is one of the largest in the village.

DULIN CHAPEL M. E. CHURCH, SOUTH. After the close of the war of 1861-65
the Methodists of Falls Church found themselves without a house of
worship, the church in which they had formerly worshipped having been
destroyed by soldiers of the Union Army while encamped close by. For a
time they held services in the "Old Falls Church," the present Episcopal
Church of the town until some of the leading members, desirous of having
a house of worship of their own, took steps towards the erection of the
present building near the site of their old church, among them being the
late H. W. Febrey, John E. Febrey, B. F. Shreve, Jos. E. Birch and Wm.
Dulin.

Mr. Wm. Dulin gave the site and soon there was erected thereon a church
which was dedicated in the spring of 1869. The parsonage was built a few
years later. The church as first built was remodeled in 1893. The
church officers are as follows: W. H. Torreyson, W. H. Shreve, R. W.
Birch, W. S. Tucker, W. M. Ellison, Trustees; W. H. Shreve, F. L. Birch,
J. H. Brunner, E. J. Febrey, W. M. Ellison, Stewards.

[Illustration: Mr. J. H. Wells]

COLUMBIA BAPTIST CHURCH. Columbia Baptist Church was organized in 1857
by Rev. Hiram Reed, and up to the beginning of the civil war had about
300 enrolled on the church books as active members.

Services were discontinued during the war and the church used as a
hospital by the Union troops. Later it was used as a public school for a
number of years prior to 1870. In that year the State Mission Board sent
the Rev. W. S. O. Thomas to reopen the church as a place of worship.
Rev. Mr. Thomas was succeeded by Rev. Hugh McCormick, now in Porto Rico.

The Mission Board assisted the church liberally in a financial way up to
the time Rev. Mr. McCormick assumed charge, since which time the
congregation has been self-supporting.

The following pastors have occupied the pulpit for various terms since
the church was first organized: Rev. Hiram Reed, Rev. Hugh McCormick,
Rev. George E. Truitt, Rev. G. W. T. Noland, Rev. J. B. Clayton, Rev. J.
T. Barbor, Rev. J. W. Kincheloe and Rev. A. W. Graves.

[Illustration: Mr. M. H. Brinkerhoff]

The church at this time has a membership of 103 and is in a more
prosperous condition than at any time since the war.

The officers of the church are: Deacons: E. J. Galpin, Thomas Hillier,
Frank Williams. Clerk, Thomas Hillier; Treasurer, Mrs. Geo. W.
Hawxhurst; Trustees, E. J. Galpin, Geo. F. McInturff, Elijah Berry.

The Sunday School has about forty scholars on the rolls, the officers of
which are: Mr. R. S. Ilsley, Superintendent, Mr. Van Quick, Assistant
Superintendent, Miss Emma Seaman, Organist.

THE FIRST CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH. The First Congregational Church of
Falls Church, Va., was organized and duly recognized by Council May 30,
1876, the Congregational Society having first been organized in October,
1875.

Services were held in the Baptist Church up to 1879 when the present
attractive church building was erected. It is of Gothic design, with
main audience room seating 300, and a Sunday School room in the rear. A
fine toned bell was purchased in 1881.

At its organization 25 members united in forming the church. At that
time it was thought by some that another church in such a small town
would result in dissension among the Christian people. Such was not the
intention of this church. At its first annual meeting a resolution was
unanimously adopted expressing "good wishes toward every church of
Christ in this place, and its readiness and desire to co-operate with
them in every good work." The other churches responded in a Christian
spirit, and the pastors and churches of this town have always cordially
worked together in the cause of the Master.

The first minister engaged by the Society was Rev. J. W. Chickering, Jr.
The first regular pastor of the church was Rev. L. B. Platt, who
supplied the pulpit from November, 1877 to July, 1880, followed by Rev.
A. L. Park, November, 1881 to December, 1882. Rev. Wm. W. Jordan, May,
1883 to October, 1885. Rev. F. W. Tuckerman, September, 1886 to May,
1890. Rev. R. E. Eels, acting pastor, February, 1891 to December, 1891.
Rev. J. H. Jenkins, January, 1893 to July, 1897. Rev. Arsene
Schmavonian, May, 1899 to May, 1901. Rev. Franklin Noble, the present
minister was called to the church December, 1901.

ST. JAMES ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH. St. James Roman Catholic Church, Falls
Church, of which Rev. Father Tierney is Pastor, was built in 1902 and is
one of the finest specimens of Gothic architecture in Northern Virginia.
It is built of Virginia sand stone taken from a quarry near the village.

The old church, a wooden structure built about 26 years ago, had become
too small for the growing congregation, and through the munificence of
Mrs. Thomas Ryan of New York City, the present handsome and imposing
edifice was erected at a more convenient point.

[Illustration: Mr. Nathan Lynch]

Father Tierney has been in charge of this parish for about ten years and
under his ministration the church has grown in numbers and influence,
the membership at present being about 325.

The church and parsonage was designed and built under the supervision of
Mr. A. O. Von Herbulis, an architect of wide reputation and a resident
of this village.

THE METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH. The Methodist Episcopal Church, situated
on Washington Street, was built in 1875 chiefly through the aid of the
late Isaac Crossman. He donated the site for the building and later
contributed liberally to its support.

Rev. D. C. Hedrick is the present pastor, to whom the congregation has
become much attached during the brief time he has been stationed here.
The following are the officers of the church: Trustees, J. M. Thorne, M.
E. Church, W. Y. Swiggett, S. S. Luttrell, W. W. Biggs, V. E. Kerr,

[Illustration: Dr. M. E. Church.]

Mr. M. E. Church is a native of the State of Vermont, but has been a
resident of Virginia for nearly twenty-five years, and of Falls Church
for the past eighteen years, during which period he has been closely
identified with every public movement. He it was who first established
telephonic communication between Falls Church and Washington City over
sixteen years ago, and from a small beginning has built up an extensive
telephone system extending over Fairfax and Alexandria Counties and
reaching to Bluemont in the Blue Ridge Mountains. The company operating
this system is incorporated under the name of the Falls Church Telephone
and Telegraph Company, and Mr. Church is the chief stock-holder,
President and General Manager. Exchanges are operated at Falls Church
and Rosslyn.

Mr. Church has brought to his adopted home a large share of the energy
and sterling business qualities for which his native state is noted.
This has been manifest from the moment he set foot on the soil of his
adopted state. He first engaged in the drug business in Falls Church
which he successfully conducted for over twelve years, during which
period he trained several young men who have since been conducting a
successful business of their own. The esteem in which he was held by his
fellow-pharmacists in the state was evidenced by his unanimous election
to the office of President of the State Pharmaceutical Association, a
position which he filled with great credit, as well as many other
positions of trust and responsibility. He still remains an active and
esteemed member of that Association.

[Illustration: Miss B. C. Merrifield]

About fifteen years ago he entered into the real estate, loan and
insurance business, and notwithstanding his lack of previous training or
experience, has been eminently successful along that line, and to him
more than any other one man, is due the growth and development of our
beautiful little village, as he has been untiring in his efforts to
locate here in homes of their own a desirable class of moral and
intellectual citizens. One of his first ventures along this line was
the organization of the Falls Church Improvement Company, of which he
was general manager and a large stock-holder. His associates in this
company were: Hon. Schyler Duryee, then Chief Clerk of the U. S. Patent
Office; Judge A. A. Freeman, now of New Mexico, and others. This company
successfully developed the "Sherwood Sub-Division," one of the first
sub-divisions put on the market in Fairfax County.

[Illustration: Mr. R. C. L. Moncure]

In the loan business Mr. Church has been particularly successful, by his
conservative investments and faithful fidelity to the interests of his
clients, both investors and borrowers have learned to place implicit
confidence in his judgment and integrity and as a result, he has been
able to bring together those who wish to borrow money with which to buy
or build a home, and those who wish to invest funds, thereby enabling
the worthy home-seeker to own his own home, making of him not only a
prominent but more interested and desirable citizen.

While not an Attorney at Law Mr. Church's experience and familiarity
with the real estate law, titles and values of land in Fairfax and
Alexandria Counties have made his services and opinions much sought
after as an expert in such matters, both by the courts and private
parties. Persons seeking homes or investments in the suburbs of
Washington will do well to consult him, as his judgment can be relied
upon in real estate matters, and his integrity is unquestioned.

[Illustration: Mr. Geo. M. Newell]

In the development of Falls Church Mr. Church has been indefatigable,
and has been personally identified with every progressive movement. In
addition to his drug-store, real estate and telephone business, he has
been largely interested in procuring better transportation facilities in
the way of electric railroads; he has built many houses in the town and
organized several companies for the purpose of developing the trade and
industries of this section. He is at present engaged in organizing an
electric light company for the purpose of furnishing light and power to
Falls Church and the country intervening between that and Washington; he
has great faith in the future of the town and is not afraid to invest
his money in home enterprises.

  At Philadelphia, Pa., January, 1901, in the largest and best class of
  Minorcas ever brought together in America up to that time, I won seven
  regular prizes and thirteen specials. At this show I had three of the
  largest cockerels ever shown at one time by a single exhibitor, their
  combined weight being 29 pounds. In a class of sixty-four females I won
  first on the best shaped bird. Also, won nearest to ideal comb on a
  cockbird in a class of nineteen.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
