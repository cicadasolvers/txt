PREFACE


The following pages must not be considered as comprising an
exhaustive Glossary of our Wiltshire Folk-speech. The field is a
wide one, and though much has been accomplished much more still
remains to be done. None but those who have themselves attempted such
a task know how difficult it is to get together anything remotely
approaching a complete list of the dialect words used in a single
small parish, to say nothing of a large county, such as ours. Even
when the words themselves have been collected, the work is little
more than begun. Their range in time and place, their history and
etymology, the side-lights thrown on them by allusions in local or
general literature, their relation to other English dialects, and
a hundred such matters, more or less interesting, have still to be
dealt with. However, in spite of many difficulties and hindrances,
the results of our five years or more of labour have proved very
satisfactory, and we feel fully justified in claiming for this
_Glossary_ that it contains the most complete list of Wiltshire words
and phrases which has as yet been compiled. More than one-half of
the words here noted have never before appeared in any Wiltshire
Vocabulary, many of them being now recorded for the first time for
any county, while in the case of the remainder much additional
information will be found given, as well as numerous examples of
actual folk-talk.

The greater part of these words were originally collected by us
as rough material for the use of the compilers of the projected
_English Dialect Dictionary_, and have been appearing in instalments
during the last two years in the _Wilts Archaeological Magazine_
(vol. xxvi, pp. 84-169, and 293-314; vol. xxvii, pp. 124-159), as
_Contributions towards a Wiltshire Glossary_. The whole list has now
been carefully revised and much enlarged, many emendations being
made, and a very considerable number of new words inserted, either
in the body of the work, or as _Addenda_. A few short stories,
illustrating the dialect as actually spoken now and in Akerman's
time, with a brief _Introduction_ dealing with Pronunciation, &c.,
and _Appendices_ on various matters of interest, have also been
added; so that the size of the work has been greatly increased.

As regards the nature of the dialect itself, the subject has been
fully dealt with by abler pens than ours, and we need only mention
here that it belongs to what is now known as the South-Western group,
which also comprises most of Dorset, Hants, Gloucester, and parts
of Berks and Somerset. The use of dialect would appear gradually
to be dying out now in the county, thanks, perhaps, to the spread
of education, which too often renders the rustic half-ashamed of
his native tongue. Good old English as at base it is,--for many a
word or phrase used daily and hourly by the Wiltshire labourer has
come down almost unchanged, even as regards pronunciation, from his
Anglo-Saxon forefathers,--it is not good enough for him now. One
here, and another there, will have been up to town, only to come back
with a stock of slang phrases and misplaced aspirates, and a large
and liberal contempt for the old speech and the old ways. The natural
result is that here, as elsewhere, every year is likely to add
considerably to the labour of collecting, until in another generation
or so what is now difficult may become an almost hopeless task. No
time should be lost, therefore, in noting down for permanent record
every word and phrase, custom or superstition, still current among
us, that may chance to come under observation.

The words here gathered together will be found to fall mainly under
three heads;--(1) Dialect, as _Caddle_, (2) Ordinary English with
some local shade of meaning, as _Unbelieving_, and (3) Agricultural,
as _Hyle_, many of the latter being also entitled to rank as Dialect.
There may also be noted a small number of old words, such as _toll_
and _charm_, that have long died out of standard English, but still
hold their own among our country people. We have not thought it
advisable, as a general rule, to follow the example set us by our
predecessors in including such words as _archet_ and _deaw_, which
merely represent the local pronunciation of orchard and dew; nor
have we admitted _cantankerous_, _tramp_, and certain others that
must now rank with ordinary English, whatever claim they may once
have had to be considered as provincial. More leniency, however, has
been exercised with regard to the agricultural terms, many that are
undoubtedly of somewhat general use being retained side by side with
those of more local limitation.

The chief existing sources of information are as follows:--(1)
the Glossary of Agricultural Terms in Davis's _General View of
the Agriculture of Wilts_, 1809; reprinted in the _Archaeological
Review_, March, 1888, with many valuable notes by Prof. Skeat;
(2) The Word-list in vol. iii. of Britton's _Beauties of Wilts_,
1825; collated with Akerman, and reprinted in 1879 for the English
Dialect Society, with additions and annotations, by Prof. Skeat;
(3) Akerman's _North Wilts Glossary_, 1842, based upon Britton's
earlier work; (4) Halliwell's _Dictionary_, 1847, where may be
found most (but not all) of the Wiltshire words occurring in our
older literature, as the anonymous fifteenth-century _Chronicon
Vilodunense_, the works of John Aubrey, Bishop Kennett's _Parochial
Antiquities_, and the collections by the same author, which form
part of the _Lansdowne MSS._; (5) Wright's _Dictionary of Obsolete
and Provincial English_, 1859, which is mainly a condensation of
Halliwell's work, but contains a few additional Wiltshire words;
(6) a Word-list in Mr. E. Slow's _Wiltshire Poems_, which he has
recently enlarged and published separately; and (7) the curious old
MS. _Vocabulary_ belonging to Mr. W. Cunnington, a _verbatim_ reprint
of which will be found in the Appendix.

Other authorities that must here be accorded a special mention are
a paper _On some un-noted Wiltshire Phrases_, by the Rev. W. C.
Plenderleath, in the _Wilts Archaeological Magazine_; Britten and
Holland's invaluable _Dictionary of English Plant-names_, which,
however, is unfortunately very weak as regards Wilts names; the Rev.
A. C. Smith's _Birds of Wiltshire_; Akerman's _Wiltshire Tales_; the
_Flower-class Reports_ in the _Sarum Diocesan Gazette_; the very
scarce _Song of Solomon in North Wilts Dialect_, by Edward Kite,
a work of the highest value as regards the preservation of local
pronunciation and modes of expression, but containing very few words
that are not in themselves ordinary English; the works of Richard
Jefferies; Canon Jackson's valuable edition of Aubrey's _Wiltshire
Collections_; and Britton's condensation of the _Natural History of
Wilts_. In _Old Country and Farming Words_, by Mr. Britten, 1880,
much information as to our agricultural terms may be found, gathered
together from the _Surveys_ and similar sources. Lastly, the various
_Glossaries_ of the neighbouring counties, by Cope, Barnes, Jennings,
and other writers, should be carefully collated with our Wiltshire
Glossaries, as they often throw light on doubtful points. Fuller
particulars as to these and other works bearing on the subject will
be found in the Appendix on _Wiltshire Bibliography_.

We regret that it has been found impossible to carry out Professor
Skeat's suggestion that the true pronunciation should in all doubtful
cases be clearly indicated by its Glossic equivalent. To make such
indications of any practical value they should spring from a more
intimate knowledge of that system than either of us can be said to
possess. The same remarks will also apply to the short notes on
Pronunciation, &c., where our utter inexperience as regards the
modern scientific systems of Phonetics must be pleaded as our excuse
for having been compelled to adopt methods that are as vague as they
are unscientific.

To the English Dialect Society and its officers we are deeply
indebted for their kindness and generosity in undertaking to adopt
this _Glossary_, and to publish it in their valuable series of
County Glossaries, as well as for the courtesy shown us in all
matters connected with the work. We have also to thank the Wilts
Archaeological Society for the space afforded us from time to time
in their _Magazine_, and the permission granted us to reprint the
_Word-lists_ therefrom.

In our _Prefaces_ to these _Word-lists_ we mentioned that we should
be very glad to receive any additions or suggestions from those
interested in the subject. The result of these appeals has been very
gratifying, not only with regard to the actual amount of new material
so obtained, but also as showing the widespread interest felt in
a branch of Wiltshire Archaeology which has hitherto been somewhat
neglected, and we gladly avail ourselves of this opportunity of
repeating our expression of thanks to all those who have so kindly
responded. To Dr. Jennings we owe an extremely lengthy list of
Malmesbury words, from which we have made numerous extracts. We have
found it of special value, as showing the influence of Somersetshire
on the vocabulary and pronunciation of that part of the county. To
Sir C. Hobhouse we are indebted for some interesting words, amongst
which the survival of the A.S. _attercop_ is well worth noting. We
have to thank Mr. W. Cunnington for assistance in many ways, and for
the loan of MSS. and books, which we have found of great service.
To Mr. J. U. Powell and Miss Kate Smith we owe the greater part of
the words marked as occurring in the Deverill district. Mr. E. J.
Tatum has given us much help as regards local Plant-names: Miss E.
Boyer-Brown, Mr. F. M. Willis, Mr. E. Slow, Mr. James Rawlence,
Mr. F. A. Rawlence, Mr. C. E. Ponting, Mr. R. Coward, the Rev. W.
C. Plenderleath, Mr. Septimus Goddard, Mrs. Dartnell, the Rev. C.
Soames, and the Rev. G. Hill must also be specially mentioned. We
are indebted to Mr. W. Gale, gardener at Clyffe Pypard Vicarage, for
valuable assistance rendered us in verifying words and reporting new
ones.

We take this opportunity of acknowledging gratefully the assistance
which we have throughout the compilation of this _Glossary_ received
from H. N. Goddard, Esq., of the Manor, Clyffe Pypard, to whose wide
knowledge and long experience of Wiltshire words and ways we owe
many valuable suggestions; from the Rev. A. Smythe-Palmer, D.D., who
has taken much interest in the work, and to whose pen we owe many
notes; from Professor Skeat, who kindly gave us permission to make
use of his reprints; and last, but by no means least, from the Rev.
A. L. Mayhew, who most kindly went through the whole MS., correcting
minutely the etymologies suggested, and adding new matter in many
places.

In conclusion, we would say that we hope from time to time to publish
further lists of _Addenda_ in the _Wilts Archaeological Magazine_ or
elsewhere, and that any additions and suggestions will always be very
welcome, however brief they may be. The longest contributions are not
always those of most value, and it has more than once happened that
words and phrases of the greatest interest have occurred in a list
whose brevity was its only fault.

INTRODUCTION


The following notes may perhaps serve to give some slight indication
as to pronunciation, &c., but without the aid of Glossic it is
impossible accurately to reproduce the actual sounds.

       *       *       *       *       *

_A_ is usually lengthened out or broadened in some way or other.

Thus in _hazon_ and _haslet_ it would be pronounced somewhat as in
_baa_, this being no doubt what the _Monthly Magazine_ means by
saying that '_a_ is always pronounced as _r_.'

When _a_ is immediately followed by _r_, as in _ha'sh_, harsh,
and _paa'son_, parson, the result is that the _r_ appears to be
altogether dropped out of the word.

_Aw_ final always becomes _aa_, as _laa_, law, _draa_, draw, _thaa_,
thaw.

In _saace_, sauce, _au_ becomes _aa_.

_A_ is also broadened into _eae_.

Thus _garden_, _gate_, and _name_ become _geaerden_, _geaet_, and
_neaeme_.

These examples may, however, be also pronounced in other ways, even
in the same sentence, as _garne_, _y[)a]t_, and _naayme_, or often
_ne-um_.

_A_ is often softened in various ways.

Thus, _thrash_ becomes _draish_, and _wash_, _waish_ or _weish_.

It is often changed to _o_, as _zot_, sat, _ronk_, rank.

Also to _e_, as _piller_, pillar, _refter_, rafter, _pert_, part.

In _vur_, far, the sound is _u_ rather than _e_.

The North Wilts version of the _Song of Solomon_ gives frequent
examples of _oi_ for _ai_, as _choir_, chair, _foir_, fair, _moyden_,
maiden; but this is probably an imported letter-change, _chayer_ or
_chai-yer_, for instance, being nearer the true sound.

       *       *       *       *       *

_E_ is often broadened into _aa_ or _aay_.

Thus _they_ gives us _thaay_, and _break_, _braayke_.

In _marchant_, merchant, and _zartin_, certain, the sound given is as
in _tar_.

_Ei_ takes the sound of _a_ in _fate_, as _desave_, deceive.

_Left_, _smell_, and _kettle_ become _lift_, _smill_, and _kiddle_.

In South Wilts _[)e]_ in such words as _egg_ or _leg_ becomes _a_
or _ai_, giving us _aig_ and _laig_ or _l[)a]g_. Thus a Heytesbury
Rosalind would render--

    'O Jupiter, how weary are my legs!'

by 'O-my-poor-vit'n-laigs!' uttered all in one gasp. In N. Wilts the
_e_ in these words is not perceptibly so altered.

The _[)e]_ in such words as _linnet_ usually takes the _u_ sound,
giving us _linnut_. In _yes_ it is lengthened out into _eece_ in S.
Wilts, and in N. Wilts into _cez_.

Long _e_ or _ee_ is shortened into _i_, as _ship_, sheep, _kippur_,
keeper, _wick_, week, _fit_, _vit_, feet, the latter word sometimes
being also pronounced as _ve-ut_.

_Heat_ becomes _het_, and _heater_ (a flat-iron), _hetter_; while
_hear_ is usually _hire_ in N. Wilts.

       *       *       *       *       *

_I_ short becomes _e_, as _breng_, bring, _drenk_, drink, _zet_, sit,
_pegs_, pigs.

Occasionally it is lengthened into _ee_, as _leetle_, little.

In _hit_ (_pret._) and _if_ it usually takes the sound of _u_, as
_hut_ and _uf_ or _uv_; but _hit_ in the present tense is _het_, and
_if_ is often sounded as _ef_ in N. Wilts.

At the beginning of a word, _im_, _in_, and _un_ usually become _on_,
as _onpossible_, _ondacent_, _oncommon_.

In present participles the sound given varies between _un'_, _en'_,
and _in'_, the _g_ almost invariably being dropped.

       *       *       *       *       *

_O_ very commonly becomes _a_, as _archet_, orchard, _tharn_, thorn,
_vant_, font, _vram_, from, _carn_, corn.

Quite as commonly it takes the _au_ or _aw_ sound, as _hawp_, hope,
_aupen_, open, _cawls_, coals, _hawle_, hole, _smawk_, smoke.

In such words as _cold_ and _four_, the sound is _ow_ rather than
_aw_, thus giving us _cowld_ and _vower_.

_Moss_ in S. Wilts sometimes takes the long _e_, becoming _m[=e]sh_,
while in N. Wilts it would merely be _mawss_.

_Know_ becomes either _knaw_ or _kneow_.

_O_ is often sounded _oo_, as _goold_, gold, _cwoort_, court,
_mwoor'n_ or _moor'n_, more than, _poorch_, porch.

_Oo_ is sometimes shortened into _[)u]_, as _shut_, shoot, _sut_,
soot, _tuk_, took.

Very commonly the sound given to _[=o]_ is _wo_ or _woae_. Thus we
get _twoad_, toad (sometimes _twoad_), _pwoast_, post, _bwoy_, boy,
_rwoaes_, a rose, _bwoaen_, bone, _spwoke_ (but more usually _spawk_ in
N. Wilts), spoke.

_Oa_ at the beginning of a word becomes _wu_, as _wuts_, oats.

_Oi_ in _noise_ and _rejoice_ is sounded as _ai_.

In _ointment_ and _spoil_ it becomes _[=i]_ or _w[=i]_, giving
_intment_ and _spile_ or _spwile_.

_Ow_ takes the sound of _er_ or _y_, in some form or other, as
_vollur_ and _volly_, to follow, _winder_ and _windy_, a window.

       *       *       *       *       *

_U_ in such words as _fusty_ and _dust_ becomes _ow_, as _fowsty_,
_dowst_.

       *       *       *       *       *

_D_ when preceded by a liquid is often dropped, as _veel'_, field,
_vine_, to find, _dreshol_, threshold, _groun'_, ground.

Conversely, it is added to such words as _miller_, _gown_, _swoon_,
which become _millard_, _gownd_, and _zownd_.

In _orchard_ and _Richard_ the _d_ becomes _t_, giving us _archet_
and _Richut_ or _Rich't_; while occasionally _t_ becomes _d_,
_linnet_ being formerly (but not now) thus pronounced as _linnard_ in
N. Wilts.

_D_ is dropped when it follows _n_, in such cases as _Swinnun_,
Swindon, _Lunnon_, London.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Su_ sometimes becomes _Shu_, as _Shusan_, Susan, _shoot_, suit,
_shewut_, suet, _shower_, sure, _Shukey_, Sukey.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Y_ is used as an aspirate in _yacker_, acre, _yarm_, arm, _yeppern_,
apron, _yerriwig_, earwig. It takes the place of _h_ in _yeaed_, head,
_yeldin_, a hilding; and of _g_ in _yeat_ or _yat_, a gate.

       *       *       *       *       *

Consonants are often substituted, _chimney_ becoming _chimbley_ or
_chimley_, _parsnip_, _pasmet_, and _turnip_, _turmut_.

       *       *       *       *       *

Transpositions are very common, many of them of course representing
the older form of a word. For examples we may take _ax_, to ask,
_apern_, apron, _girt_, great, _wopse_, wasp, _aps_, the aspen,
_claps_, to clasp, _cruds_, curds, _childern_, children.

       *       *       *       *       *

_F_ almost invariably becomes _v_, as _vlower_, flower, _vox_, fox,
_vur_, far, _vall_, fall, _vlick_, flick, _vant_, font.

In such words as _afterclaps_ and _afternoon_ it is not sounded at
all.

       *       *       *       *       *

_L_ is not sounded in such words as _amwoast_, almost, and
_a'mighty_, almighty.

       *       *       *       *       *

_N_ final is occasionally dropped, as _lime-kill_, lime-kiln.

       *       *       *       *       *

_P_, _F_, _V_, and _B_ are frequently interchanged, _brevet_ and
_privet_ being forms of the same word, while to _bag_ peas becomes
_fag_ or _vag_ when applied to wheat.

       *       *       *       *       *

_R_ is slurred over in many cases, as _e'ath_, earth, _foc'd_,
forced, _ma'sh_, marsh, _vwo'th_, forth.

It often assumes an excrescent _d_ or _t_, as _cavaltry_, horsemen,
_crockerty_, crockery, _scholard_, scholar.

       *       *       *       *       *

_H_ has the sound of _wh_ in _whoam_, home. This word, however, as
Mr. Slow points out in the Preface to his Glossary--

    _Bob._ Drat if I dwon't goo _wom_ to marrer.

    _Zam._ Wat's evir waant ta go _wimm_ var.

    _Bob._ Why, they tell's I as ow Bet Stingymir is gwain to be
    caal'd _whoam_ to Jim Spritely on Zundy.--

is variously pronounced as _wom_, _wimm_, and _whoam_, even in the
same village.

As stated at page 72, the cockney misuse of _h_ is essentially
foreign to our dialect. It was virtually unknown sixty or seventy
years ago, and even so late as thirty years back was still unusual
in our villages. _Hunked_ for _unked_ is almost the only instance to
be found in Akerman, for instance. But the plague is already fast
spreading, and we fear that the Catullus of the next generation will
have to liken the Hodge of his day to the Arrius (the Roman 'Arry) of
old:--

    C_h_ommoda dicebat, si quando commoda vellet
      Dicere, et _h_insidias Arrius insidias ...
    Ionios fluctus, postquam illuc Arrius isset,
      Iam non Ionios esse, sed _H_ionios.

Touching this point the Rev. G. Hill writes us from Harnham Vicarage
as follows:--'I should like to bear out what you say with regard to
the use of the letter _h_ in South-West Wilts. When I lived in these
parts twenty years ago, its omission was not I think frequent. The
putting it where it ought not to be did not I think exist. I find
now that the _h_ is invariably dropped, and occasionally added, the
latter habit being that of the better educated.'

_H_ becomes _y_ in _yeaed_, head.

       *       *       *       *       *

_K_ is often converted into _t_, as _ast_, to ask, _mast_, a mask,
_bleat_, bleak.

_T_ is conversely often replaced by _k_, as _masking_,
acorn-gathering, from 'mast,' while sleet becomes _sleek_, and pant,
_pank_.

       *       *       *       *       *

_S_ usually takes the sound of _z_, as _zee_, to see, _zaa_, a saw,
_zowl_, soul, _zaat_ or _zate_, soft, _zider_, cider, _zound_, to
swoon.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Thr_ usually becomes _dr_, as _dree_, three, _droo_, through,
_draish_, to thrash.

In _afurst_, athirst, and _fust_, thirst, we still retain a very
ancient characteristic of Southern English.

_T_ is always dropped in such words as _kept_ and _slept_, which
become _kep'_ and _slep'_.

       *       *       *       *       *

Liquids sometimes drop the next letter, as _kill_, kiln; but more
usually take an excrescent _t_ or _d_, as _varmint_, vermin,
_steart_, a steer, _gownd_, gown.

       *       *       *       *       *

_W_ as an initial is generally dropped in N. Wilts in such cases as
_'oont_, a want or mole, _'ooman_, woman, _'ood_, wood.

Occasionally in S. Wilts it takes the aspirate, _'ood_ being then
_hood_.

       *       *       *       *       *

Final _g_ is always dropped in the present participle, as _singin'_,
_livin'_, living; also in nouns of more than one syllable which end
in _ing_. It is, however, retained in monosyllabic nouns and verbs,
such as _ring_ and _sing_.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Pre_ becomes _pur_, as _purtend_, pretend, _purserve_, preserve.

       *       *       *       *       *

Sometimes a monosyllabic word will be pronounced as a dissyllable,
as we have already mentioned, _ne-um_, _ve-ut_, _ve-us_, and _ke-up_
being used concurrently with _naayme_, _vit_ or _fit_, _veaece_, and
_kip_ or _keep_.

       *       *       *       *       *

The prefix _a_ is always used with the present participle, as
_a-gwain'_, going, _a-zettin' up_, sitting up.

       *       *       *       *       *

The article _an_ is never used, a doing duty on all occasions, as
'Gie I a apple, veyther.'

       *       *       *       *       *

Plurals will be found to be dealt with in the _Glossary_ itself,
under _En_ and _Plurals_.

       *       *       *       *       *

Pronouns will also be found grouped together under _Pronouns_.

       *       *       *       *       *

_As_ is used for _who_, _which_, and _that_.

       *       *       *       *       *

Active verbs govern the nominative case.

       *       *       *       *       *

Verbs do not agree with their nominative, either in number or person.

       *       *       *       *       *

The periphrastic tenses are often used in S. Wilts, as 'I do mind
un,' but in N. Wilts the rule is to employ the simple tenses instead,
merely altering the person, as 'I minds un.' In S. Wilts you might
also say 'It be a vine night,' whereas in N. Wilts ''Tes a vine
night' would be more correct.

       *       *       *       *       *

In conclusion we would mention that we hope in the course of the next
year or two to be able to deal with the grammatical and phonological
sides of our Dialect in a somewhat more adequate manner than it has
been possible to do on the present occasion.

    carried in the pocket and examined at an inn over a glass of
    spirits and water.'--_The Toilers of the Field_, p. 28.

=Glory-hole=. A place for rubbish or odds and ends, as a housemaid's
cupboard, or a lumber room.--N.W.

    'This has nothing to do with Lat. _gloria_, but is connected
    with M.E. _glorien_, to befoul (_Prompt. Parv._). Compare Prov.
    Eng. _glorry_, greasy, fat. Thus _glory-hole_=a dirty, untidy
    nook. See _Folk-Etymology_, p. 145.'--SMYTHE-PALMER.

*=Glox=. This is given by most authorities as a noun, and defined as
'the sound of liquids when shaken in a barrel' (A.B.H.Wr.); but it
is really a verb, and refers to the motion and peculiar gurgling of
liquids against the side of a barrel or vessel that is not quite full
(C.). In Hants _gloxing_ is the noise made by falling, gurgling water
(Cope). Cf. ~Lottle~.--N.W., obsolete.

    'Fill the Barrel full, John, or else it will glox in
    Carriage.'--_Cunnington MS._

=Glutch=. To swallow (A.B.C.S.). According to _Cunnington MS_, the
use of _glutch_ implies that there is some difficulty in swallowing,
while _quilt_ is to swallow naturally.--N. & S.W.

in a goggmire,' in a regular fix or dilemma.--N.W.

    'In Minty Common ... is a boggie place, called the _Gogges_....
    _Footnote_. Perhaps a corruption of _quag_, itself a
    corruption of _quake_. "I be all in a goggmire" is a North
    Wilts phrase for being in what appears an inextricable
    difficulty.'--JACKSON'S _Aubrey_, p. 271.

=Goggle=. (1) _n._ A snail-shell. Cf. E. _cockle_ (Skeat).--N.W.

giggly, I can't scarce kip my lags nohow.'--S.W. (Steeple Ashton.)

=Goggles=. A disease in sheep (_Agric. of Wilts_, ch. xiv).--N.W.

near Clyffe Pypard, years ago.--G. E. D.

    'On past the steep wall of an ancient chalk-quarry, where the
    ploughboys search for pyrites, and call them thunderbolts and
    "gold," for when broken the radial metallic fibres glisten
    yellow.'--_Greene Ferne Farm_, ch. v.

acid biting into the steel. The 'Grindstone Apple' mentioned in the
_Eulogy of R. Jefferies_, p. iv. is probably the 'Grindstone Pippin'
of _Wood Magic_, not the crab.--N.W.

=Grip=, or =Gripe=. (1) To _grip_ wheat is to divide it into bundles
before making up the sheaves.--N.W. (2) _n._ 'A grip of wheat,' the
handful grasped in reaping (A.). It is _laid down in gripe_ when laid

    'A whirlewind took him up ... and layd him down safe, without
    any hurt, in the next ground.'--AUBREY'S _Nat. Hist. Wilts_ p.
    16, ed. Brit.

Portland oolite--useful for bridges, &c., where great strength is
required (Britton's _Beauties_, vol. iii).

(Clyffe Pypard.)

=Grump=. 'To grump about,' to complain of all sorts of ailments.--N.W.

*=Grupper=. To give up (Wr.). There would appear to be some mistake
here, as we cannot trace the word elsewhere.

*=Gubbarn=. _n._ A filthy place, a foul gutter or drain (A.H.Wr.),
~Gubborn~ (B.). Should not this be _adj._ instead of _n._? Compare

=Guzzle-berry=. Gooseberry. Used by children.--N. & S.W.


=H=. It should be noted that the cockney misuse of _H_ is essentially
foreign to our dialect. Formerly it was the rarest thing in the
world to hear a true Wiltshire rustic make such a slip, though the
townsfolk were by no means blameless in this respect, but now the
spread of education and the increased facilities of communication
have tainted even our rural speech with cockneyisms and slang phrases.

=Hack=. (1) _v._ To loosen the earth round potatoes, preparatory
to earthing them up. This is done with a 'tater-hacker,' an old
three-grained garden-fork, which by bending down the tines or

something resembling a rake, but used as a hoe. In Dorset hoeing is

=Hail=. The beard of barley. See ~Aile~, which is the more correct

    p. 8.

=Hait-wo=. See above.

=Hakker=, =Hacker=. To tremble (S.), as with passion (A.), cold, or
ague. ~Hagger.~ To chatter with cold (H.Wr.).--N. & S.W.

    How a hackers an bivers, to be zhure!'--_Wilts Tales_, p. 55.

=Half-baked=, or =Half-saved=. Half-witted.--N. & S.W.

*=Hallantide=. All Saints' Day (B.).

=Hallege=, =Harrige=. _n._ The latter seems to be the original form
of the word, and is still occasionally heard; but for at least
seventy years it has been more commonly pronounced as _hallege_,
_l_ and _r_ having been interchanged. We have met with it at Clyffe
Pypard, Bromham, Huish, and elsewhere in N. Wilts; but, so far as
we know, it is not used in S. Wilts. _Havage_=disturbance, which
the Rev. S. Baring-Gould heard once in Cornwall, and made use of
in his fine West-Country romance, _John Herring_, ch. xxxix, is
doubtless a variant of the same word. (1) Of persons, a crowd; also,
contemptuously, a low rabble. 'Be you a-gwain down to zee what they
be a-doing at the Veast?' 'No, _I_ bean't a-gwain amang such a
hallege as that!'--N.W. (2) Of things, confusion, disorder. Were a
load of _top and lop_, intended to be cut up for firewood, shot down
clumsily in a yard gateway, it would be said, 'What a hallege you've
a-got there, blocking up the way!--N.W. (3) Hence, it sometimes
appears to mean rubbish, as when it is applied to the mess and litter
of small broken twigs and chips left on the ground after a tree has
been cut and carried.--N.W. (4) It is also occasionally used of a
disturbance of some sort, as 'What a hallege!' what a row!--N.W.

=Ham=. (1) A narrow strip of ground by a river, as ~Mill-ham~ (A.D.).
(2) See Haulm (S.).

=Hames=. Pieces of wood attached to a horse's collar in drawing
(A.D.).--N. & S.W.

=Hanch= (_a_ broad). Of a cow or bull, to thrust with the horns,
whether in play or earnest.--N.W.

a long rest, so as to freshen up the pasture.--N.W.

=Hang-fair=. A public execution, as 'Hang-fair at 'Vize,' formerly
treated as a great holiday.--N.W., obsolete. The Pleasure Fair at
Warminster on August 11 is known as 'Hang-Fair,' perhaps from the
hanging of two murderers there on that day in 1813. See _Wilts Notes
and Queries_, i. 40, 139.

=Hang-gallows=. A gallows-bird (S.).--N. & S.W.

is hung to its post. Frequently heard, although ~Har~ is much more

open fireplaces in old cottages and farm-houses. See ~Coglers~.--N.W.

*=Hants-sheep=, =Hants-horses=. See quotation.

    'They were called [in Wilts] hants sheep; they were a sort of
    sheep that never shelled their teeth, but always had their
    lambs-teeth without shedding them, and thrusting out two
    broader in their room every year.... There were such a sort of
    horses called hants horses, that always showed themselves to be
    six years old.'--LISLE'S _Husbandry_, 1757.

its post. A.S. _heorre_, M.E. _herre_, the hinge of a door. See
~Head~ and ~Hanging-post~.--N.W. (Marlborough; Huish; Clyffe Pypard.)

    'We wants some more heads and hars cut out.' Carpenters about
    Marlborough usually reduce the word to a single letter in
    making up their accounts, as 'To a new R to Cow-lease gate,
    &c.'--Rev. C. SOAMES.

=Hardhead=. _Centaurea nigra_, L., Black Knapweed.--N. & S.W.

=Harl=. (1) _v._ To thrust a dead rabbit's hind-foot through a slit
in the other leg, so as to form a loop to hang it up or carry it
by (_Gamekeeper at Home_, ch. ii). _Hardle_ in Dorset.--N. & S.W.
(2) _v._ To entangle (C.). _Harl_, knotted (A.S.), is a mistake for
_harled_.--N. & S.W. (3) _n._ An entanglement (B.C.). 'The thread
be aal in a harl.' A knot (Aubrey's _Nat. Hist. Wilts_, p. 51, ed.
Brit.)--N. & S.W. *(4) Of oats, _well-harled_ is well-eared (D).

=Harrige=. See HALLEGE.

*=Harrows=. The longitudinal bars of a harrow (D.).

=Harvest-trow=. The shrew-mouse (_Wild Life_, ch. ix); ~Harvest-row~
(A.H.Wr.)--N.W.

*=Hask=. A husky cough to which cows are subject (Lisle's
_Husbandry_). See HUSK.

=Hatch=. (1) _n._ A 'wallow,' or line of raked-up hay.--N.W. (2) _v._
'To hatch up,' to rake hay into hatches.--N.W. (3) _n._ A half-door

you must step to enter.--N.W.

=Haulm=, =Ham=, =Haam=, =Helm=. A stalk of any vegetable (A.B.),
especially potatoes and peas.--N. & S.W.

=Haycock=. A much larger heap of hay than a 'foot-cock.'--N. & S.W.

*=Hayes=. A piece of ground enclosed with a live hedge; used as a
termination, as ~Calf-Hayes~ (D.). A.S. _hege_ (Skeat).

=Hay-home=. See quotation.

    'It was the last day of the hay-harvest--it was "hay-home" that
    night.'--R. JEFFERIES, _A True Tale of the Wiltshire Labourer_.

=Hay-making=. Grass as it is mown lies in _swathe_ (N. & S.W.); then
it is _turned_ (S.W.), preparatory to being _tedded_ (N. & S.W.), or
_spread_; then raked up into lines called _hatches_ (N.W.), which
may be either _single hatch_ or _double hatch_, and are known in
some parts as wallows (N.W.); next _spread_ and _hatched up_ again,
and put up in small _foot-cocks_, _cocks_ (N.W.), or _pooks_ (N. &
S.W.); finally, after being thrown about again, it is _waked up_
into _long wakes_ (N.W.), or _rollers_ (S.W.), and if not made
temporarily into _summer-ricks_ (N.W.), is then carried. No wonder
that John Burroughs (_Fresh Fields_, p. 55) remarks that in England
hay 'is usually nearly worn out with handling before they get it into
the rick.' Almost every part of the county has its own set of terms.
Thus about Warminster meadow-hay is (1) turned, (2) spread or tedded,

    humming-birds!' said the school-children at Huish, in the most
    decided manner, when cross-examined as to the Gold-crest.
    Apparently the same use obtains in Devon, as Martin speaks of
    the 'humming-bird' as occurring in certain localities about
    Tavistock, which are assigned to the Gold-crest by other
    writers. See MRS. BRAY'S _Description of Devon_, 1836, vol. ii.
    p. 146.

The number of sheaves was formerly ten, for the tithing man's
convenience, but now varies considerably, according to the crop.
~Tithing~ in N.W. ~Hile-a-whate~ (S.) The forms given by Davis,
_aisle_, _aile_, and _isle_, seem purely fanciful, as also does the
derivation there suggested, a _hyle_ being merely a single shock.
In some parts of Wilts the shape and size of a hyle will depend
largely on the weather at harvest-time. Thus in a stormy season it
will usually be built compact and round, while in a calm one it may
sometimes form a line several yards in length.--S.W.

    ''Tis merry while the wheat's in hile.'--BARNES, _Poems_.

*=Isnet=. _Alkanet bugloss_ (D.).

*=Ivors=. Hanging woods (_Slow_).--S.W. There would appear to be
some misunderstanding here. The word may refer to the coverts on the
hillside above Longbridge Deverill, which are known as _The Ivors_,
the farm below being _Long Ivor Farm_. At Wroughton a field is called
'_The Ivory_,' but this is perhaps a family name.

ago fires are said to have occurred so frequently on the premises

    says were distributed by lot. See Kemble's _Anglo-Saxons_, i.
    91.'--JACKSON'S _Aubrey_, note, p. 198.

    16-1/2 feet. The first of these measures is getting out of
    use, but is still retained in some places, particularly in
    increasing mason's work. The second is the ancient forest
    measure, and is still used in many parts of the county for
    measuring wood-land. But the last, which is the statute perch,
    is by much the more general.'--_Agric. of Wilts_, p. 268.

(2) Any rod or pole (D.H.), as a perch for fowls, a clothes pole
(A.B.). See ~Oven-lug~.

    St. George, a brickmaker whose name is Davis, is called "Mace
    Davis," and sons of farmers are called "Mace John," or "Mace
    Thomas," the surname being sometimes added and sometimes
    not.'--_Wilts Arch. Mag._ vol. i. p. 338.

This seems a misapprehension. The word used is simply _Mais'_
(before a consonant), a shortened form of 'Maister.' 'Mais' John'
is short for Maister John. Before a vowel it would be _Mais'r_ or
_Maistr'_--as 'Maistr' Etherd' [Edward].--N.W.

    '_Mas_ was formerly a common contraction for _master_, e.g.
    "Mas John," and is used by Ben Jonson and other Elizabethan
    writers. See Nares, s.v. _Mas_.'--SMYTHE-PALMER.

=Madell= (_a_ broad), =Medal=, &c. The game of 'Merrills' or 'Nine
Men's Morris.' Also known as ~Puzzle-Pound~. Several varieties of
~Madell~ are played in Wilts, known respectively as ~Eleven-penny~
(strictly ~The Merrills~), ~Nine-penny~, ~Six-penny~, and
~Three-penny~, according to the number of pieces used. 'Eleven-penny'
is played with eleven pieces each side, instead of nine, the
game being in other respects identical with 'Nine Men's Morris'
as described in Strutt's _Sports and Pastimes_. The players move
alternately, and the general principle is to get three pieces
together in a line anywhere on the dots or holes, while at the same
time preventing your adversary from making a line. 'Nine-penny,'
'Six-penny,' and 'Three-penny' differ only in the number of men
each side and the form of the board (_see diagrams_). The 'board' is
scratched or chalked out on paving-stones, drawn on the slate, cut
deep into the turf on the downs, or the top of the corn-bin (with
holes instead of dots), in short, made anywhere and anyhow. The 'men'
or 'pieces' may be anything available, sticks being played against
stones, beans against oats, &c.--N.W. (Devizes, &c.)

when of opposite sex or both female; but that if both are male one
is invariably thus abnormal (_Evolution of Sex_, ch. iii. p. 39).

~Thease~, ~Thic here~, &c.=this. ~Theesum~, or ~Theesum here~=these.
Occasionally ~Theesen~ in S. Wilts. ~Thick~ and ~Thuck~ require some
explanation. ~Thuck~ always=_that_, but is mainly a N. Wilts form,
its place in S. Wilts being usually taken by ~Thick~. ~Thic~ or
~Thick~ often=_this_ in N. Wilts, but far more frequently=_that_,--in
fact, the latter may probably now be taken as its normal meaning,
although it would appear to have been otherwise formerly. In
_Cunnington MS._, for instance, it is stated that 'The old terms
_thic_ and _thoc_ almost constantly exclude the expressions This
and That,' and similar statements are found in other authorities.
In ~Thick here~ and ~Thick there~ the use of the adverb defines the
meaning more precisely. As regards the neighbouring counties, it may
be said that in Som. and Dors. ~thick~=_that_; while in N. Hants it
never does so (see Cope's _Glossary_), always there meaning _this_.
It should be noted that the _th_ is usually sounded _dth_, much as
in Anglo-Saxon. ~His'n~=his; ~Hern~, or occasionally ~Shis'n~,=hers;
~Ourn~=ours; ~Theirn~=theirs; ~Yourn~=yours; ~Whosen~=whose, as
'Whosen's hat's thuck thur?' ~Mun~=them, is occasionally, but not
often, used. ~Arra~, ~Arra one~, ~Arn~, &c.=any. Negatives, ~Narra~,
~Narra one~, ~Narn~, &c. 'Hev 'ee got arra pipe, Bill?' 'No, I han't
got narn.' In the Pewsey Yale ~Ma~ is occasionally used for ~I~, in
such phrases as 'I'll go we 'ee, shall ma?' or 'I don't stand so
high as he, do ma?' About Malmesbury (and elsewhere in N. Wilts) the
following forms may be noted:--~Wither~, other; ~Theasamy~, these;
~Themmy~, those; ~Totherm~ or ~Tothermy~, the other.

'ghost-word,' and struck out of our glossaries. In _Cunnington MS._
it is written as ~Sprawny~, q.v., but Britton when transcribing from

    'The handle of a "squailer" projected from Orion's coat-pocket.
    For making a squailer a tea-cup was the best mould:... A ground
    ash sapling with the bark on, about as thick as the little
    finger, pliant and tough, formed the shaft, which was about
    fifteen inches long. This was held upright in the middle of
    a tea-cup, while the mould was filled with molten lead. It
    soon cooled, and left a heavy conical knob on the end of the
    stick. If rightly thrown it was a deadly missile, and would fly
    almost as true as a rifle ball. A rabbit or leveret could thus
    be knocked over; and it was peculiarly adapted for fetching a
    squirrel out of a tree, because, being so heavy at one end, it
    rarely lodged on the boughs, as an ordinary stick would, but
    overbalanced and came down.'--_Amateur Poacher_, ch. iii.

    'The "squaler" came into use very early in the school's
    history, and was for years almost as much a part of the
    ordinary equipment of a Marlborough boy as a cricket-bat would
    now be. To later generations the very name probably conveys no
    meaning. The weapon itself was simple enough, though extremely
    formidable. It consisted of a piece of lead something the shape
    and about the size of a pear, with a cane handle about eighteen
    inches long. A squaler could be thrown a great distance and
    with terrific force, and at short ranges by the practised hands
    of the Marlburians of those days with great accuracy. Its
    ostensible purpose was squirrel-hunting, as the name suggests
    [No, it is not a contraction of "squirreller," but is from
    _squail_, to throw.--_G.E.D._], but it came in handy for the
    larger quarry which the more adventurous tribes pursued and
    slew, such as rabbits, hares, and very frequently even deer.
    It lingered on as an article of local sale till the middle of
    the sixties; but ... was made contraband, and finally died
    out.'--_History of Marlborough College_, ch. ix. p. 94.

    'To make a squailer you provide yourself with an eighteen-inch
    length of half-inch cane, two inches of which you sheath with
    tow and then insert in a ladle of molten lead. There you
    manipulate it in such sort that there is presently left to
    cool at the end of your cane a pear-shaped lump of lead of
    the weight experience has shown you to be proper. With this
    weapon an adept can bring down a squirrel from on high, or
    stop one on the level at five-and-twenty yards, almost to a
    certainty.'--W. F. WALLER in _Notes & Queries_, 8th series, ii.
    p. 197. 'Another Marlborough mode of making it is to pour the
    melted lead into a cone composed of many folds of well-wetted
    paper, tied round the slightly notched upper end of the cane or
    ground ash.'--G. E. DARTNELL in _N. & Q._, 8th series, ii. p.
    257. Also see various letters in _N. & Q._, 8th series, ii. pp.

    'Wheatly (_On the Common Prayer_, ed. 1848, pp. 233-4) quotes
    from a letter of one G. Langbain, 1650, as follows:--"certe
    quod de Lacte vaccarum refert, illud percognitum habeo in
    agro _Hamtoniensi_ (an et alibi nescio) decimas Lacticiniorum
    venire vulgo sub hoc nomine, _The Whites of Kine_; apud
    Leicestrenses etiam Lacticinia vulgariter dicuntur
    _Whitemeat_."'--SMYTHE-PALMER.

=White Couch=. See ~Couch~.

=White-flower=. _Stellaria Holostea_, L., Greater Stitchwort.--N.W.
(Huish.)

*=White-house=. A dairy (H.Wr.).

=White-livered=. Pale and unhealthy-looking (S.).--N. & S.W. At
Clyffe Pypard the word has a yet stronger idea of disease about it,
and a 'white-livered' woman is popularly supposed to be almost as
dangerous as was the poison-nurtured Indian beauty who was sent as
a present to Alexander the Great. How the 'whiteness' of the liver
is to be detected is not very clear, but probably it is by the
pallor of the face. At any rate, if you discover that a young woman
is 'white-livered,' do not on any account marry her, because the
whiteness of the liver is of a poisonous nature, and you assuredly
will not live long with a white-livered young woman for your wife. It
is most unhealthy, and if _she_ does not die, _you_ will! The word is
so used of both sexes.

1873, of Jefferies' _Goddard Memoir_, also _Wilts Arch. Mag._ vol. x.

Devon.--N. & S.W.

    'They're a couple o' th' ugliest wosbirds in the vair.'--Wilts
    Tales, p. 89.

In his _Dictionary of Provincial English_, Wright defines this as
'a wasp,' a mistake too amusing to be passed over! Probably his
informant heard a rustic who had got into a wasp's nest, and been
badly stung, 'danging they wosbirds,' and on asking what he meant by
'wosbirds' was told that they were the 'wopses,' and not unnaturally
concluded that the two words were synonyms.

=Wout=. A carter's order to a horse to bear off. The opposite to Coom
hether.

=Wrap=. _n._ A thin strip of wood. See ~Rap~.

=Wrastle=. To spread, as cancer, fire, roots, &c.--N.W.

    'These fires are, or were, singularly destructive in
    villages--the flames running from thatch to thatch, and, as
    they express it, "wrastling" across the intervening spaces. A
    pain is said to "wrastle," or shoot and burn.'--_Wild Life_,
    ch. iv. p. 68.

=Y=. Many words beginning with H, G, or a vowel, are usually sounded
with Y prefixed, as _Yacker_, acre; _Yeppern_, apron; _Yat_, or
_Yeat_, gate; _Yeldin_, a hilding; and _Yerriwig_, earwig.

Verbs ending in _y_ often drop that letter. Thus empty and study
become _empt_ and _stud_.

The free infinitive in _y_ was formerly much used, but is now dying
out. It was used in a general question, as 'Can you _mowy_?' Were a
special piece of work referred to, _mowy_ would not be correct, the
question then being simply 'Can you _mow_ thuck there meaed?'

The following example of the 'free infinitive' is given in
_Cunnington MS._:--

    'There is also here a Peculiar mode of forming active verbs
    from Nouns, which are generally in use as apellations for
    professions--take an Example. Well Mary, how do you get on
    in Life? what do you and your family do _now_ to get a Living
    in these times--Wy Zur we do aal vind Zummut to do--Jan, ye
    know, he do _Smithey_ [work as a smith] Jin the beggist wench
    do spinney the Little one do Lace makey--I do _Chorey_ [go out
    as a Chore Woman] and the two Boys do Bird keepey--that is One
    works as a smith--one spins one makes Lace one goes out as a
    Chore woman & two are Bird keepers which Latter term were more
    to the purpose if expressed Bird frightener or driver.'

sometimes as a kind of query--'Don't you think so?'--but usually to
give a strong emphasis to some assertion.--N.W.

    i.

    'Fine growing marning, you.'--_Ibid._ ch. i.

    'That be a better job than ourn, you.'--_Hodge and his

to an utterly good-for-nothing fellow, but is gradually dying out

it come to the boil.--N.W. (Malmesbury.)

=Zammy=. (1) _n._ A simpleton, a soft-headed fellow (S.).--S.W. *(2)
_adj._ 'Zammy tea,' half-cold, insipid tea.--N.W. (Hullavington.)

This and the last two words belong to Som. rather than Wilts. A.S.
_s[=a]m-soden_, half boiled.--N.W. (Malmesbury.)

SPECIMENS OF DIALECT

We have thought it advisable to supplement the brief examples
of folk-talk which will be found in the body of this work by a
few somewhat longer specimens, which may be taken as accurately
representing the speech current at the present time among the
villages in North Wilts. Mr. Slow has kindly added a similar specimen
for South Wilts. The extracts from Akerman exemplify the North Wilts
speech of some fifty or sixty years ago.


EXTRACTS FROM THE GENUINE REMAINS OF WILLIAM LITTLE[1].

By J. Y. AKERMAN.

(From _Wiltshire Tales_, pp. 165-179.)

[North Wilts.]

I.

There be two zarts o' piple in this here world ov ourn: they as works
ael day lang and ael the year round, and they as dwon't work at ael.
The difference is jist a graat a-year, and they as dwon't work at ael
gets the graat--that's zartin!

II.

It's oondervul to me how thengs _do_ move about whenever a body's got
a drap o' zummut in's yead. Last harrest, a'ter zupper, at th' house
yander, I walked whoam by myzelf, and zeed the moon and the zeven
stars dancin' away like vengeance. Then they girt elmen trees in the
close was a dancin' away like Bill Iles and his mates at a morris.
'My zarvice to 'e,' zays I; 'I haups you won't tread on my twoes;'
zo I went drough a sheard in th' hedge, instead o' goin' drough th'
geat. Well, when I got whoam, I managed to vind the kay-hole o' th'
doower--but 'twas a lang time afore I could get un to bide still
enough,--and got up stayers. Massy upon us! the leetle table (I zeed
un very plain by the light o' th' moon) was runnin' round th' room
like mad, and there was th' two owld chayers runnin' a'ter he, and by
and by, round comes the bed a'ter they two. 'Ha! ha!' zays I, 'that's
very vine; but how be I to lay down while you cuts zich capers?'
Well, the bed comed round dree times, and the vowerth time I drowd
myzelf flump atop ov un; but in th' marnin' I vound myzelf laying on
the vloor, wi' ael me duds on! I never _could_ make out this.

III.

I've allus bin as vlush o' money as a twoad is o' veathers; but,
if ever I gets rich, I'll put it ael in Ziszeter bank, and not do
as owld Smith, the miller, did, comin' whoam vrom market one nite.
Martal avraid o' thieves a was, zo a puts his pound-bills and ael th'
money a'd a got about un, in a hole in the wall, and the next marnin'
a' couldn't remember whereabouts 'twas, and had to pull purty nigh a
mile o' wall down before a' could vind it. Stoopid owld wosbird!

IV.

Owld Jan Wilkins used to zay he allus cut's stakes when a went a
hedgin', too lang; bekaze a' cou'd easily cut 'em sharter if a
wanted, but a' cou'dn't make um langer if 'em was cut too shart. Zo
zays I; zo I allus axes vor more than I wants. Iv I gets that, well
and good; but if I axes vor little, and gets less, it's martal akkerd
to ax a zecond time, d'ye kneow!

V.

Maester Tharne used to zay as how more vlies was cot wi' zugar or
honey than wi' vinegar, and that even a body's enemies med be
gammoned wi' vine words. Jim Pinniger zeemed to thenk zo too, when
a run agin the jackass one dark night. Jem tuk th' beawst vor th'
devil, and cot un by th' ear. '_Zaat's yer harn, zur_' (Soft's your
horn, sir), zays Jem.

VI.

Old Iles was drunk vor dree days together last Lammas, and a laid
down by the doower, and wanted zomebody to hauld un. When they axed
if a'd ha' a leetle drap mwore, a'd zeng out, 'Noa, noa, I won't
ha' a drap.'--'Do'e,' zaid they,--'do'e ha' a drap mwore.'--'Noa, I
won't, not a drap,' a grunted. At last another tried un, and then th'
owld bwoy cried out, 'Noa, I can't get a drap mwore down m';--drow't
auver m'veace!'

VII.

Measter Goddin used to zay as how childern costed a sight o' money to
breng um up, but 'twas all very well whilst um was leetle, and zucked
th' mother, but when um begun to zuck the vather, 'twas nation akkerd.

VIII.

Measter Cuss, and his zun Etherd, went to Lonnun a leetle time zence;
and when um got to their journey's ind, Measter Cuss missed a girt
passel a carr'd wi' un to th' cwoach. 'Lor', vather!' zays Etherd, 'I
zeed un drap out at 'Vize!' (Devizes.)

IX.

When I was a young man I had a dog, a precious 'cute un a was
too! A'd catch a hare like a grayhound. I've cot a scare o'
rabbuts wi' him in one night. By and by zomebody zays to the
kippur, thuck William's got a dog as plays th' devil wi' ael th'
game. Zo th' kippur comes up to m' one day, and zays, zays he,
'Maester Little, thuck dog o' yourn's a bad un; a gwos huntin', I'm
towld.' 'Lar bless'e!' zays I, 'a wou'dn't harm a mouse, that a
wou'dn't.'--'Dwon't b'lieve it!' zays he. 'Come along wi' I by thuck
copse yonder.'--Zo as us walked alang, up jumps a hare and away a
scampers. 'Hollo! hollo!' zays I to the dog, but a slunk behind
m' _di_rectly wi's tail between's legs. 'Ha!' zays th' kippur, 'I
b'lieves 'e now, Little. Them as zays your dog hunts be liars, that's
zartin. I'll be cussed if I dwon't thenk a's vrightened o' th' game,
that I do!' and zo a walked away, and wished m' good marnin'.--'Zo,
ho!' thought I; 'you be 'nation 'cute, you be, Maester Kippur. If
instead o' "_hollo_!" I'd a cried "_coom hedder_!" a'd a run a'ter
thuck hare like mad!'

[_Note._--The point of this story is that the poacher's dog had been
trained to understand the usual orders in _exactly the opposite
sense_, as the Devonshire smugglers' horses were in old days.
Thus, the more a smuggler called on his horse to stop, when he was
challenged by an Excise officer, the faster it would gallop off, the
owner all the while apparently endeavouring to check it but really
urging it on. See Mrs. Bray's _Description of Devon_.]

X.

'How far d'e cal't to Zirencester, my friend?' zays a Cockney
genelman one day to owld Pople, as a wor breakin' stwones on th'
road. 'Dwont kneow zich a please,' zays he, scrattin's yead, 'never
yeard on't avore!'--'What!' zays the genelman, 'never heard o'
Zirencester?'--'Noa,' zays he, 'I aint.'--'Why, it's the next town.'
'Haw! haw!' zays Pople; 'you means _Ziszeter_; why didn't'e zay so?
it's about vower mile off.'--He was a rum owld customer, thuck owld
Pople. One day zomebody axed un how var't was to Ziszeter. 'Ho! dree
miles this weather.' (It was nation dirty and slippy.) 'Why so?' zaid
the man to'n; 'Ho, it's about two miles in vine weather; but when
it's hocksey, like this, we allows a mile vor zlippin' back!'

THE HARNET AND THE BITTLE.

BY J. Y. AKERMAN.

[North Wilts.]

    A Harnet zet in a hollow tree,--
    A proper spiteful twoad was he,--
    And a merrily zung while a did zet
    His stinge as zharp as a baganet,
    'Oh, who's zo bowld and vierce as I?--
    I vears not bee, nor wapse, nor vly!'
        _Chorus_--Oh, who's zo bowld, etc.

    A Bittle up thuck tree did clim',
    And scarnvully did luk at him.
    Zays he, 'Zur Harnet, who giv' thee
    A right to zet in thuck there tree?
    Although you zengs so nation vine,
    I tell'e it's a house o' mine.'
        _Chorus_--Although you zengs, etc.

    The Harnet's conscience velt a twinge,
    But growin' bould wi' his long stinge,
    Zays he, 'Possession's the best law,
    Zo here th' shasn't put a claw.
    Be off, and leave the tree to me:
    The Mixen's good enough vor thee!'
        _Chorus_--Be off, and leave, etc.

    Just then a Yuccle passin' by
    Was axed by them their cause to try.
    'Ha! ha! it's very plain,' zays he,
    'They'll make a vamous nunch for me!'
    His bill was zharp, his stomack lear,
    Zo up a snapped the caddlin pair.
        _Chorus_--His bill was zharp, etc.

    MORAL.

    All you as be to law inclined,
    This leetle story bear in mind;
    For if to law you ever gwo,
    You'll vind they'll allus zarve'e zo;
    You'll meet the vate o' these 'ere two:
    They'll take your cwoat and carcass too!
        _Chorus_--You'll meet the vate, etc.

dialect, will be found at pp. 28, 29 of Ellis's _English

[North Wilts: Hilmarton.]

Etherd he bin sart o' rough fur this long time, wuver he never bin

[North Wilts: Clyffe Pypard.]

My veyther now, he never 'oudden yeat none o' this here Hostilian

'Do meak I shrill, the vurry _sight_ on't do--they tells I as't do

Wull, my brother Jim, he kneowed this o' course, an' he do most in

veyther, 'I wur allus _ter'ble_ vond o' mutton pie, an' our Mary her
never 'oon't gie I none on't at whoam.'

Zo veyther he had a plate vull on't, an' a begun a gettin' this yer

'twer meaed o' mutton, didden 'ee? Let it be whatever 'twill, 'twer

An' Jim he looks at un zart o' comical, an' a zes, 'Veyther, 'twer
meaed o' some o' thuck Hostilian meat as you zed as nobody shudden
'suade 'ee to yeat none on!'

An' zimmin to I veyther's feace turned zart o' aal colours, and a

agean!' An' none on us dursen zaay no more to un, a look'd so guly,
we was aveard as he 'ood.

But aater 'bout a haaf an hour Jim he zes, 'Veyther, an' how d'ee

THE CANNINGS VAWK.

[North Wilts: Clyffe Pypard.]

I niver wur at Cannin's but once as I knaws on, an' that wur when
Mr. Jones wur alive. I went awver wi' he to Cannin's Veast. I mind
thur wur a lot on 'em thur from Ca'an [Calne] as wur a tellin' up
zuch tales as was never about the Cannin's vawk. The' tell'd I as
zome on 'em got up the Church tower, and dunged that thur--what is
it?--a-top o' the tower, to make un grow as big as the spire. I never
he-ard tell o' zuch a thing! Should 'ee iver thenk as 'twer true?
An' the' tell'd I as 'twern't but a vurry veow years ago as zome on
'em hired as ther wur a comut ur what 'ee caals ut, to be zeed in
'Vize market-place, an' pretty nigh aal Cannin's went in thur to zee

zummat o' that, as cudden putt th' yead into a barr'l; an' a tell'd
he's bwoy to get inside and howld un up till he'd a vastened un.
An' when a done the bwoy hollered out droo the bung hawl, 'How be
I to get out, veyther?'--That bit tickled I, bless 'ee! moor'n aal

sarvice at our place; an' I zes 'I b'lieve as 'tes.' An' a zes, 'Do
'ee iver zaa _Baa_! to she?' An' I zes 'Noa, vur why should I zaay
_Baa_! to she?' An' a zes 'You should allus zaay _Baa_! to a body as
comes vrom Cannin's.' 'Wull,' I zes, 'I shudden like to zaay _Baa_!
to any body wi'out I know'd the rason on't.' An' then a tell'd I as

didden take no nautice, an' a went on chatterin'. An' I zes '_Baa_!'
agean. An' that put her pot on, bless 'ee! at a terrible rate, an'
she zes to I, 'Who be _you_'--she zes,--'to zaay _Baa_! to I?' An'
wi' that they boath on 'em went auf in-a-doors, an' they niver come a

APPENDIX I

A Bibliography of Works relating to Wilts or illustrating its Dialect.


Most of the works comprised in the following list have lately been
read through, and compared with our own _Glossary_, and references
to many of them will be found in the foregoing pages. Some may
contain a more or less comprehensive Wiltshire Glossary; others
only a few words. Some belong absolutely to our own county; others
merely to the same group of dialects. But all are of value as
bearing on the subject. The Berks, Dorset, Gloucester, Hants, and
Somerset Glossaries of course contain a large proportion of words
and uses that are either absolutely identical with ours, or vary but
slightly therefrom, while such works as _Amaryllis, Dark, Lettice
Lisle_, and _Jonathan Merle_ on the one side, and _Old Country Words_
and _English Plant-names_ on the other, are full of examples and
illustrations of the South-Western Folk-speech. Even where their
scene is laid somewhat outside the borders of Wilts itself, the
dialect, with but trifling alterations, would pass as ours.

More, Quamp, Quarr, Quilt, Quop, Skiel, Sleepy, Tail-ends, Tallet_,
and _Tid_) are not there assigned to Wilts; but as Britton may very
possibly have found them so localized in the revised 1811 edition,

the whole of them, on his authority.

APPENDIX II

Cunnington MS.


Among the various books and word-lists which we have consulted during
the progress of this work, by no means the least interesting is the
manuscript containing a _Collection of a few Provincial Terms used in
North Wilts_, believed to have been compiled about the middle of last
century, which was kindly lent us by its present owner, Mr. William
Cunnington, and is here frequently referred to as _Cunnington MS._

This valuable relic was at one time in the possession of Mr. J.
Britton, as is proved by the notes in his _early_ handwriting on the
outer leaves, and was evidently the source to which he was indebted
for some portions of his 1825 _Glossary_ (in the _Beauties of Wilts_,
vol. iii), the very peculiar wording and spelling of some of its
paragraphs having been transferred direct to his pages. It must,
however, have been in his hands at a much earlier date than 1825, as
one or two of the notes appear to have been made at the time he was
collecting materials for the 1814 volume on Wilts.

Not only has it afforded us several hitherto un-noted words, which
Mr. Britton himself had passed over, possibly because even in
his own time they were already grown obsolete, but it has also
enabled us to clear up several doubtful points, and especially to
show how, by a very simple misreading of the MS., from the easily
identified _sprawny_ (a variant of _sprunny_) was evolved that
mysterious 'ghost-word' _sprawing_, which has ever since misled our
glossary-makers, each one having seemingly taken it on the faith of
his immediate predecessor.

The _Vocabulary_, which we here reproduce _verbatim et literatim_,
consists of ten quarto pages, the first two of which are covered with
notes in pencil and ink, in at least four different hands, partly
archaeological and topographical, and partly relating to dialect
words in Wilts and elsewhere. It is written in an extremely legible
old hand, with a few additions and interlineations in other hands,
and contains about one hundred words and phrases, of which we owe
just two-thirds to the original compiler, who is supposed to have
been a North Wilts clergyman. If so, it is probable that his very
characteristic handwriting could readily be identified by any one who
was familiar with our last-century parish registers.

The interlineations have been made at different dates and in
different hands, _acrass_, _chit_, _clout_, _gallered_, _hire_,
_hitch_, _muxen_, _shirk off_, _slink away_, _skillin_, _stowl_,
_stole_, _thick_ and _thuck_, _won't_, with the numerals at the end,
being in pencil, two or three of them having been inked over at
some time or other; while _arran_, _clavey_, _clap to_, _desperd_,
_dowse_, _hit_, _nan_, _plye_, _rathe_, _sprawny_, the definition
of _thick_ and _thuck_, _tun_, _tag_, _twit_, and _vuddels_, are in
ink, and mostly in a much larger and somewhat peculiar hand. The
pencilling is now almost entirely obliterated.

The MS. was given by Mr. Britton to Mr. Cunnington, with other books
and papers, many years ago, and its existence appears to have been
unknown until we called attention to it in the _Wilts Archaeological
Magazine_, vol. xxvi. p. 293.

APPENDIX III

Monthly Magazine Word-list.


In the _Monthly Magazine_, Sept. 1814, vol. xxxviii. p. 114, a
short and very badly arranged list of South Wilts Words and Phrases
occurs. We have thought it best to reproduce it here, _verbatim
et literatim_, from the Magazine itself, kindly lent us by Mr.
Cunnington, as the account given of it in the Preface to Professor
Skeat's reprint of Akerman is in some respects slightly inaccurate.
Thus, he omits all mention of _Hogo_ and some other words or phrases,
while _Tatees_ is misquoted as _taters_ and _Theseum_ as _Thescum_.
The remarks made on the latter word will therefore require some
modification.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
