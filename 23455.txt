  That model Miss, Jemima Jane
  Was very good, and very plain;
  Her parents noticed with delight
  How neat she was, and how polite.
  Sometimes her young companions came
  And begged she'd join them in a game.
  But it was never any use;
  She'd make some civil, quiet excuse,
  And, "Dear Mama," she'd whisp'ring say,
  "I love plain sewing more than play;
  I hope you'll always think of me
  As your own gentle, busy Bee!"
  Jane rose at five. "What for?" you ask;
  And I reply, "To con her task."
  She breakfasted on milk and bread,
  Nor ever asked for aught instead;
  "I like it best, because," said she,
  "'Tis wholesome for a child like me."
  She used to think it quite a treat,
  To put her bed and chamber neat;
  But she enjoyed--oh, better far!
  Saying her tasks to her Mama.

    [Illustration: _Jane's Uncle_]

  She took the air when these were done,
  But she would never romp and run;
  Prim and sedate she walked about,
  Her back quite straight, her toes turned out:
  And all the people, seeing this,
  Exclaimed, "Oh, what a model Miss!"
  Jane's Uncle, who lived far away,
  Sent her Mama a note one day,
  Explaining that he found he had
  To spend a fortnight in Bagdad.
  He had a daughter, and 'twas plain
  He hoped that she might stay with Jane.
  "She's a sad puss," he said, "I own;
  But I can't leave the child alone."
  "I think," Mama said, in a fuss,
  "We can't have _her_ to stay with us:
  I do not like my Jane to mix
  With children who have naughty tricks."
  But Jane said, with a gentle smile,
  Plying her needle all the while,
  "Pray, let her come here, dear Mama,
  With the permission of Papa;
  I have a hope that she might be
  Influenced for her good by me:
  For I could show her that she would
  Be happier if she were good."

    [Illustration: "_She bought a rod that afternoon_"]


    [Illustration: "_Ann was brought there by
    a serving man_"]

  At this her kind Mama relented,
  And, as her good Papa consented,
  That very day her mother wrote
  Her uncle quite a cordial note,
  Saying, "I think that it is clear
  Your Ann should spend your absence here"
  As she expected Ann quite soon,
  She bought a rod that afternoon.
  And sure enough, next Tuesday, Ann
  Was brought there by a serving-man.
  Alas! alas! it soon was plain
  She was not in the least like Jane!
  She ran and laughed and romped about,
  And raised a hubbub and a shout.
  "Oh, fie!" said Jane, "Pray, cousin Ann,
  Do be more tranquil if you can."
  But Ann just laughed, and did not care,
  And tweaked her cousin by the hair.
  When they were out she climbed a tree,
  Which quite annoyed the "busy Bee."
  "Fie, fie!" she cried. Ann said "Here goes:"
  And aimed an acorn at her nose!
  So Jane replied, "My good Mama
  Shall know how rude and rough you are."
  "Your good Mama!" said little Ann;
  "Well, if you want to tell, you can."
  She went away--went whistling too,
  Such a rude, boyish thing to do!

    [Illustration: "_Aimed an acorn at her nose_"]


    [Illustration: "'_Indeed, _indeed_, I would much rather
    not proceed_'"]

  They went home shortly after, so
  Jane told Mama her tale of woe.
  "I do not tell this tale from choice,"
  She said, in her most gentle voice;
  "I thought you ought to know, you see,
  How cousin Ann climbed up a tree;
  And when I chid in gentle fashion,
  She flew into a dreadful passion,
  And--dear Mama, indeed, _indeed_,
  I would much rather not proceed."
  But since her mother thought it best,
  She dutifully told the rest.
  --"She threw things at me, tore my hair,
  And _whistled_ as she left me there!"
  At this Mama looked grim and stern,
  And said that Ann had much to learn;
  And that she really felt unable
  To have such naughty girls at table.
  So when the others supped that day
  (Their stew smelt sav'ry by the way),
  Ann had to stand upon a seat,
  And did not get a thing to eat;
  While Jane kept slyly peeping round,
  And swallowed with a sucking sound.
  And there poor Ann was forced to stay
  When supper was all cleared away.
  Jane's good Papa began to read
  A very solid book indeed;
  Jane took her work, and sat near by,
  And pricked Ann's ankles on the sly.

    [Illustration: "_Pricked Ann's ankles on the sly_"]


    [Illustration: "_Laughed at her look of pained surprise_"]

  And there in fact Ann had to wait
  Until the clock was striking eight,
  When Jane's Mama believed it time
  To say that ladies never climb,
  But that to fall into a pet,
  And fight, is more disgraceful yet!
  Her little loving, gentle Jane
  Should not be treated so again.
  She added more. At last she said
  Ann might come down, and go to bed.
  Jane gently whispered, "Dear, you would
  Be happier if you were good."
  Ann mutter'd "Pig!"--but no one heard
  Her use that most improper word.
  It chanced that nearly every day
  The cousins quarrelled at their play.
  Good little Janie always ran
  And told Mama of naughty Ann;
  --Of how she tied Jane's flaxen hair
  To the back portion of her chair,
  And when her cousin tried to rise,
  Laughed at her look of pained surprise.
  How she had torn Jane's Sunday skirt,
  And squirted at her with a squirt!
  --And how another evening, she
  Slipped salt into Jane's dish of tea;
  And many another naughty feat
  Did Ann perform and Jane repeat.
  When Ann called Jane a "Tell-tale-tit,"
  She went and told Mama of it.
  She sighed, "I wondered how she _could!_
  I long to help her to be good."
  Jane's kind Mama, I need not say,
  Behaved in the most prudent way;
  Correcting Ann in various ways
  And giving Jane much well-earned praise.

    [Illustration: "_Slipped salt into Jane's dish of tea_"]


    [Illustration: "_Off she started at a run_"]

  Now in that village, every year
  The people held a cattle fair;
  And stalls and tents and swings were seen
  Set up upon the village green.
  Now when the fair came round that spring
  Ann longed to go like anything.
  "Oh, Aunt," she cried, "do let us go!"
  And pouted when her Aunt said "No."
  Next morning when out walking, Ann
  Concocted such a naughty plan!
  She had some money of her own,
  And she would see the fair alone!
  (I hope no other little miss
  Has ever made a scheme like this.)
  When she believed that no one saw,
  She slipped out at the big front door,
  And off she started at a run,
  To see the shows and all the fun.
  Now little Jane sat prim and neat
  Upon the parlour window seat;
  And so she saw her cousin go,
  And guessed she meant to see the show.
  "Mama!" she murmured, with a sigh,
  "My cousin Ann has just run by;
  I sadly fear--but no! oh, no!
  It could not be to see the show."
  Mama at once sent Betsy out
  To see what Ann could be about:
  And Betsy found her at the fair
  Watching a big performing bear;
  And Betsy brought her to her Aunt,
  Altho' she fought and cried "I shan't!
  I shan't go back! I won't go in!"
  --And kicked poor Betsy on the shin.

    [Illustration: "_Watching a big performing bear_"]


    [Illustration: "_Jane fetched the rod_"]

  Her Aunt, on hearing all, looked grave,
  And said, "Is this how you behave?
  You disobeyed me, and you fought!
  --Go, Jane, and fetch the rod I bought."
  Jane joyfully laid down her book,
  And ran off with a merry look;
  While Ann stood looking pale and queer,
  And wishing that "Papa were here."
  "Miss, to your room!" Mama said; so
  Away poor Ann was forced to go.
  Jane fetched the rod, and said, "Oh, why
  Will my poor cousin be so sly?
  I cannot bear," the child confessed,
  "To see my dear Mama distressed."
  Mama then took the rod, and went,
  Leaving her daughter well content:
  Jane's gentle smile grew quite sublime,
  For her Mama was gone some time.

    [Illustration: "_Jane's gentle smile grew quite sublime_"]


    [Illustration: "_Hot and tired_"]

  When twenty minutes had expired
  She came in looking hot and tired;
  And very shortly after, she
  Went out to drink a dish of tea
  With several friends she long had known,
  Leaving her little girl alone.
  Jane found it rather dull to read;
  She soon felt very dull indeed.
  How interesting Ann's tales had been
  About that circus she had seen.
  Jane wished Mama had let them go
  And see this cattle fair and show.
  She almost thought it would be fun
  To go alone, as Ann had done.
  "'Twill be her fault, if I _do_ go;
  _She_ made me want to see the show.
  Mama will not suspect the plan
  Because I told her about Ann,"
  She said, as she decided on it,
  And went to fetch her beaver bonnet.
  Betsy the maid was busy, so
  Nobody saw Miss Janie go.
  Prim and particular and neat
  She minced along the village street,
  And safely reached the village green
  Unnoticed, and in fact unseen.
  Once there, Miss Jane, I grieve to say,
  Behaved in quite a naughty way!
  --She even rode a wooden horse,
  Though with propriety, of course;
  She bought some sweetmeats at a stall
  And then sat down and ate them all;
  She saw the clowns and acrobats,
  And the performing dogs and cats.
  She thought them very clever, yet
  The pig-faced lady was her pet!

    [Illustration: "_With propriety_"]


    [Illustration: "_A woman saw her tears_"]

  Soon it grew dark, and little Jane
  Began to feel some drops of rain;
  Her gown would spot, if it got wet;
  And what a whipping she would get
  If kind Mama could ferret out
  What her dear child had been about.
  If she got wet, they'd ask her "Why?"--
  And here poor Jane began to cry.
  A woman saw her tears--and saw
  The pretty necklace which she wore.
  "Come, come!" she said, "my little Miss,
  Don't spoil your pretty eyes like this;
  If you're afraid of getting wet
  Come to my caravan, my pet,
  And I'll be proud if Miss will take
  A dish of tea and slice of cake."
  Jane thought the woman kind and nice,
  And so she followed her advice:
  But after she had drunk her tea
  She felt as drowsy as could be,
  And so, although she tried to keep
  Awake, she soon was fast asleep.
  When she awoke, her head felt fit
  To fall to pieces, and to split;
  Her necklace and her clothes were gone,
  And she had next to nothing on.
  Her hair was short, and was--alack!
  No longer fair, but bluish black!
  And she herself was--only think!
  Spotted all over brown and pink!
  Too scared to cry, she rose and saw
  A giant, dwarf, and several more.
  In fact, it soon was pretty plain
  These wicked men had stolen Jane,
  And meant to use her as a show,
  Dressed as a "spotted child," you know.
  She struggled hard to be polite;
  "Pray, sirs," she asked, "can this be right?"
  "You 'old your bloomin' row!" they said,
  And rudely cuffed her on the head.

    [Illustration: "'_Pray, sirs,' she asked,
    'can this be right?_'"]


    [Illustration: "_Quite fond of Ann_"]

  When Jane's Mama at length returned,
  How dreadful was the news she learned!
  Her child was gone!--And it was vain
  To seek and search and call for Jane!
  They hunted for her everywhere--
  They even sought her at the fair;
  But days went by, and then a week,
  So that it seemed no use to seek.
  Oddly enough--Mama began
  Really to feel quite fond of Ann,
  Now that there was no virtuous Jane
  To carry tales and to complain.
  And Ann felt sorry for her Aunt
  Altho' she said: "I really can't
  Conceive why it should cause her pain
  To lose a little pig like Jane!"
  Now that Ann's Aunt was left in peace
  She made excuses for her niece;
  If she were noisy at her play,
  She said, "I like to see her gay."
  And if she grew a trifle wild,
  She only shook her head and smiled.
  When Ann's Papa returned, one day,
  And came to fetch his child away,
  Mama was grieved to lose her niece,
  And proffered her a guinea-piece,
  Saying: "You must stay longer, when
  You come to visit me again."
  Now all this time, poor Jane, we know,
  Was made a laughing-stock and show.
  They told her, did she dare explain
  That she was only little Jane,
  And not a spotted girl at all,
  They'd beat her till she couldn't crawl.
  She had to wait on all the rest,
  And had to do her very best;

    [Illustration: "_Proffered her a guinea-piece_"]


    [Illustration: "_She had to wait on all the rest_"]

  So that, she sometimes quite forgot
  Whether her back was straight or not!
  And even, so the story goes,
  Sometimes forgot to point her toes!
  Jane found the children in the van
  Were infinitely worse than Ann;
  They punched her head and tore her hair,
  And pinched and nipped her everywhere,
  And when she said, "A little child
  Ought to be tractable and mild!"
  They only made an ugly face,
  And pinched her in another place.
  After a time this seemed to teach
  Jane it was better not to preach:
  And even now and then, she would
  Forget that she was very good.
  She wished it had not been her plan
  Always to tell Mama of Ann.
  After two months had passed away,
  She even might be heard to say
  That she had been a spiteful cat
  To treat her Cousin Ann like that!
  Now Jane's good parents went to stay
  With Ann's Papa one autumn day;
  And while they both were staying there,
  The people held a kind of fair.
  "Pray, brother," Jane's Mama began,
  "Do let me take your little Ann;
  For she would like to see the show."
  And he replied, "We all might go."
  And so that afternoon they went,
  And gravely passed from tent to tent;
  And finally, the party stept
  Into the tent where freaks where kept.

    [Illustration: "_Gravely passed from tent to tent_"]


    [Illustration: "_And threw her arms round little Ann_"]

  "Look at that child," said one, "I'm sure
  Her spots are paint and nothing more."
  Cried Ann: "I do not care a fig
  For looking at that spotted pig!"
  But at her voice, Jane shrieked and ran,
  And threw her arms round little Ann.
  "Save me! oh, save me!" she did plead;
  "I'm not a spotted pig, indeed!"
  While her Mama screamed out, "You're not
  My Jane!"--and fainted on the spot.
  And her Papa desired to know
  Who was the master of the show?
  But he, as afterwards transpired,
  Had very modestly retired.
  Then everyone had much ado
  To bring Jane's fainting mother to:
  At last she sat up with a start,
  And pressed her darling to her heart.
  "My Jane!" she cried, "my Jane!! my Jane!!!"
  And seemed inclined to faint again.

    [Illustration: "_Fainted on the spot_"]


    [Illustration]

  When Jane regained her native hearth
  She had a very thorough bath:
  But tho' she used all soaps then known,
  And soda too, and pumice-stone,
  She sadly saw she still had got
  More than one noticeable spot!
  And so poor Miss Jemima Jane
  Tho' still more good, is still more plain.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
