OPERATIC NOTES.

_Monday._--Tannhaeuserites disappointed. Signor VIGNAS indisposed.
_Tannhaeuser's_ understudy _Faust_ put up. House good. Performance
better. PLANCON,--once _Jupiter_ now _Mephistopheles_, the extremes
meeting in one singer,--excellent. MELBA quite the German Fraeulein.
BEVIGNANI, C. B., _i.e._, "Conducting Beautifully," in the chair.

_Tuesday._--Many other attractions, yet heart is true to Opera. M.
VICTOR MAUREL, as _Iago_, adds another leaf to his victor's wreath of
Laurel. MAGGIE MACINTYRE makes distinct advance, and sings, "O Willow,
we have missed you" most melodiously. TAM AGNO as _Misther O'Tello_,
the Irish darky singer, uncommonly powerful. RICHARD GREEN, _Montano_,
greener than ever: quite fresh. PERCY MORDY a good _Roderigo Randomo_.
The highly Pole-ish'd OLITZKA a fair representative of _Emilia_. And
this cast, with Merry MANCINELLI manipulating musicians, makes the
Opera a delight to the _fine fleur_ of the Covent Gardenian Hot House.

[Illustration: Pagliacci.]

_Wednesday._--House crammed to see and hear ADELINA PATTI as _Rosina_
in the ever delightful _Barbiere di Siviglia_. ROSSINI for ever!
"Whar's your WULLIE WAGNER noo?" PATTI'S acting worth a third of the
money; her singing makes up t'other two-thirds. "Bonus" to audience in
"_Home, Sweet Home_." Wrapt attention! Here we are all of us out for
the night, so to speak, in silks and satins and jewels rare, and with
feathers and diamonds and all our war paint on, off afterwards
to routs, balls and supper-parties, and yet all hushed,
conscience-stricken as it were, in the midst of our gaiety, by sweet
voice warbling so distinctly "Home! Home! Home! Sweet Home! Wherever
(including the Opera Covent Garden) we wander (and we can't wander
when our attention is riveted on _la Diva_) there is no-oh-o-o place
like Ho-ome!" And then, second verse finished, a storm of rapturous
applause bursts over the singer! Yes! those are our sentiments. "Home!
Home!" by all means. Only--excuse us--we "_won't_ go Home Sweet Home
till morning, till daylight doth appear." But why, ADELINA
_mia_, didst thou sing at the end of the Opera that remarkably
anti-climaxious waltz of TI-TO-TUM MATTEI'S? TI-TO-TUM all very well
in his way, but not a ROSSINI. And then you sang it from a paper
in your hand as though doing penance in a music sheet? A mistake,
ADELINA, don't do it again, spin your TI-TO-TUM at a concert, but
not in ROSSINI'S _Barbiere_. BERTHA BAUERMEISTER obtained a rapturous
encore, but shook her finger at the audience as who would say "too
late! too late!" So BEVIGNANI bowed, and on we went again merrily.
PINI-CORSI good as pantaloon _Bartolo_. ANCONA a capital _Figaro_,
looking like one of _Cruikshank's_ comic characters. 'ABRY MUNDY,
fine _Basilio_ done in Italian oils; M. BONNARD, light and airy
French count, more of larker than lover. All Home-Sweet-Home-ing (or
elsewhere) about midnight, many being detained by the singers at the
Opera from getting to the SPEAKER'S "at Home," Sweet Home.

_Thursday._--_Pagliacci_, with Miss PAULINE JORAN appearing as
_Nedda_, and playing it in first-rate style. "Gee up! _Nedda!_"
_Query._ PINI-CORSI good as _Tonio_? _Answer._ 'CORSI was. T'others
not much, but Opera still charming. Yet this evening's programme
too trying for emotional persons. _Pagliacci_, tragedy; _Cavalleria
Rusticana_ tragedy also; tragedy from beginning to end; even the
celebrated _mezzo_ very like a wail! Not kind of DRURIOLANUS to
afflict us thus. Madame BELLINCIONI, "the original _Santuzza_,"
admirable. Honours easy between Madame CALVE and BELLINCIONI. The
latter played it first abroad; but the former had the start of her
_here_. In some of the action peculiarly characteristic of the type,
BELLINCIONI wins, not by a neck, but by two hands. CALVE more striking
(hands down) in her jealous agony. Signor VALENTINE FIGARO ANCONA
excellent as _Alfio_; the situation when VIGNAS, going strong as
_Turiddu_, catches _Alfio's_ ear, in order, as he says in Sicilian,
"Tu-rid-u of his presence" by subsequently killing him, more dramatic
than ever. GIULIA RAVOGLI admirable as quite the gay _Lola_ of the
Sicilian Seven Dials. After _intermezzo_ Bowing BEVIGNANI declines
_encore_.

_Friday._--Child _Harold_ allowed to sit up late for another night.
Composer COWEN ought to sing, "I love my ALBANI with an A, because
she's Admirable." _Harold_ improveth on representation. _William
Malet_ played by RICHARD GREEN. Nice of the librettist, Sir EDWARD
MALET, to keep the memory of his ancestor Green. It must make singers
rather nervous to have the composer _vis-a-vis_ conducting his own
work; as WAGSTAFF observes, "in this instance it must have the effect
of Cowin' them." 'Nother week gone.

A SIESTA.

How sleepy I feel! It is this beastly influenza cold and headache. The
best thing to do for a headache is to have a little doze and sleep
it off. Not a very easy thing to do in a big Paris hotel in the
afternoon. However, it is quiet enough in my room, looking on to the
courtyard, away from the noises of the Boulevard.

Just dropping off. Crash! Only someone shutting a door. That is not an
unusual sound. In these big hotels no one closes a door, no one glides
along a passage, no one speaks in a soft voice, but everyone bangs,
and stamps, and shouts. If it is a woman, she screams. Another crash!
The man in the next room just come in. That's the Frenchman with the
awful cough. No one but a Frenchman could have a cough like that. Lie
and listen to his cough for some time. Various other doors banged. But
at last sink into unconsciousness. Good Heavens! What's happened now?
Oh, it's the American trunks being dragged out of the room on the
other side. Well, at any rate I shall not hear the American voices now
through that miserable door of communication, which, locked and bolted
ever so carefully, does not keep out sounds. But there is someone
talking there now. Of course the new comers. It must be two people.
No, twenty people. By Jove, they are Germans! And there's the
Frenchman's cough again. I shall never get to sleep. Yet somehow
the sounds get confused, I fancy the Germans are coughing and the
Frenchman is saying "_Ja, ja, ja,_" and then----

There, now I am awake again. Why, there's someone knocking at the
door. "_Pardon, monsieur, avez-vous recu votre linge?_" "_Mais, oui,
je l'ai recu hier._" "_Pardon, monsieur, il y a des faux-cols._"
"_Non, je les ai recus tous._" "_Mais, monsieur----_" "_Mais qu'est-ce
que vous me chantez la? Laissez-moi tranquille._" "_Mais, monsieur,
le monsieur en face m'a dit que monsieur a recu des faux-cols que
monsieur----_" Confound the collars! Get up, let in the _garcon_,
examine my collars and the collars of the _monsieur en face_, who is
just packing up, rectify the mistake of the washerwoman, and am again
alone. Now is it worth going to sleep or not? Will try once more.

What's that? "MARIE!" It's someone shouting outside my door. How fond
they are of shouting outside my door! "MARIE! _De l'eau chaude._" I
hope she won't think it's for me, or she'll wake me up if at last
I get a chance of dropping off. Then silence. Positively, absolute
silence. The coughing Frenchman must have been suffocated; the
Germans--no, nothing could stop the Germans from talking, only they
have gone out of hearing. And the _femme de chambre_ has hurried off
to fetch that hot water for somebody, and the _garcon_ is not banging
his broom about in this _couloir_, and there is no baggage coming or
going, and no door crashing; and, in the midst of profound peace, I
think drowsily of quiet country afternoons, when one hears only the
humming of the bees, and the whispering of the aspens, and then, and
then----Hullo! What's up now? There's someone else knocking. My last
chance gone. My head is aching more than ever. "_Eh bien?_" "_C'est
l'eau chaude que vous avez commandee, Monsieur._"

  For Soap and Pill each English slope and hill
  Is now a background, and the cry is, "Still
  They come;" these public nuisances, that mar
  The fair earth's face, like some unsightly scar.
  Who possibly can care, I ask, to learn
  That Juno Soap Saves Washing, or to turn
  A gaze disgusted on some blatant board,
  By which the devious tourist is implored
  To try the Lightning Pill that never fails
  To spot the Spot, or cure whatever ails?
  JOHN BULL, his missus and the kids, I hope,
  Do not entirely live on pills and soap.
  And yet you'd surely think so, when you've scanned
  The nostrum-signs that so adorn our land!
  Oh! heavily I'd tax 'em, if I might!
  And keep the landscape clear. Am I not right?

SOCIETY'S NEXT CRAZE.

(_As foreseen by Mr. Punch's Second-sighted Clairvoyant._)

    _It is the summer of 1896--or possibly '97. The scene is a
    road skirting Victoria Park, Bethnal Green, which Society's
    leaders have recently discovered and appointed as the_
    rendez-vous _for the Season, and where it is now the correct
    thing for all really smart people to indulge, between certain
    prescribed hours, in sports and pastimes that have hitherto
    been more characteristic of the masses than the classes. The
    only permissible mount now is the donkey, which must be ridden
    close to the tail, and referred to as a "moke." A crowd of
    well-turned-out spectators arrives from the West End every
    morning about eleven to watch the brilliant parade of
    "Mokestrians" (as the Society journalist will already have
    decided to call them). Some drive slowly up and down on
    coster-barrows, attended by cockaded and disgusted grooms.
    About twelve, they break up into light luncheon parties; after
    which they play democratic games for half an hour or so, and
    drive home on drags._

[Illustration]

_Mr. Woodby-Innett_ (_to the_ Donkey Proprietor). Kept a moke for me?
I told you I should be wantin' one every mornin' now.

_The Donkey Proprietor_ (_after consulting engagement-book_). I've
not got it down on my list, Sir. Very sorry, but the Countess of
CUMBERBACK has just booked the last for the 'ole of this week. Might
let you 'ave one by-and-by, if Sir HASCOT GOODWOOD brings his in
punctual, but I can't promise it.

_Mr. Woodby-Inn._ That's no good; no point in ridin' after the right
time. (_To himself, as he turns away._) Nuisance! Not that I'm so keen
about a moke. Not a patch on a bike!--though it don't do to say so.
Only if I'd known this, I'd have turned up in a tall hat and frock
coat; and then I could have taken a turn on the steam-circus. Wonder
if it would be any sort of form shyin' at cocoa-nuts in tweeds and a
straw hat. Must ask some chap who knows. More puzzlin' what to put on
this year than ever!

_Lady Ranela Hurlingham_ (_breathlessly to_ Donkey Proprietor). That's
mine, isn't it? Will you please put me up, and _promise_ me you'll
keep close behind and make him run. (_Suppliantly._) You will, _won't_
you?

_The Donkey Proprietor_ (_with a due sense of his own value_). Well,
I dessay I can come along presently, Lady 'URLINGHAM, and fetch 'im
a whack or two; jest now I can't, having engaged to come and 'old the
Marshiness of 'AMMERCLOTH'S on _'er_ moke; but there, you orter be
able to git along well enough by yourself now--_you_ ought!

_Captain Sonbyrne_ (_just home on leave from India--to_ Mrs.
CHESHAM-LOWNDES). Rather an odd sort of idea this--I mean, coming all
the way out here to ride a lot of donkeys, eh?

_Mrs. Chesham-Lowndes._ It used to be rather amusing a month ago,
before they all got used to riding so near the tail; but now they're
all so good at it, don't you know.

_Capt. Sonb._ I went down to Battersea Park yesterday to see the
bicyclists. Not a soul there, give you my word!

_Mrs. C.-L._ No; there _wouldn't_ be _this_ season. You see, all sorts
and conditions of people began to take it up, and it got too fearfully
common. And now moke-riding has quite cut it out.

_Capt. Sonb._ But why ride donkeys when you can get gees?

_Mrs. C.-L._ Oh, well, they're democratic, and cheap, and all that,
don't you know. And one really can't be _seen_ on a horse this
year--in town, at least. In the country it don't matter so much.

_First Mokestrian_ (_to second ditto_). Hullo, old chap, so _you_'ve
taken to a moke at last, eh? How are you gettin' on?

_Second Mokestrian._ Pretty well. I can sit on his tail all right now,
but I can't get into the way of keepin' my heels off the ground yet,
it's so beastly difficult.

_Fragments from Spectators._ That's rather a smart barrow, Lady
BARINRAYNE'S drivin' to-day.... Who's the fellow with her, with the
paper feather in his pot-hat? Bad style, _I_ call it.... That's Lord
FREDDY FUGLEMAN--best dressed man in London. You'll see everybody
turnin' up in a paper feather in a day or two.... Lot of men seem to
be using a short clay as a cigarette-holder now, don't they?... Yes,
RODDIE RIPPINGILL introduced the idea last week, and it seems to have
caught on. [_&c., &c._]

AFTER LUNCHEON; AT THE STEAM-CIRCUS, AND OTHER SPORTS.

_Scraps of Small-talk._ No end sorry, Lady GWENDOLIN; been tryin' to
get you a scent-squirt everywhere; but they're all gone; such a run on
'em for Ascot, don't you know.... Thanks; it doesn't matter; only dear
Lady BUCKRAM has just thrown some red ochre down the back of my neck,
and ALGY VERE came and shot out a coloured paper thing right in my
face, and I shouldn't like to seem uncivil.... Suppose I shall see
you at Lady BRABAZON'S "Kiss in the Ring" at Bethnal Green to-morrow
afternoon?... I believe she _did_ send us cards, but we promised to
look in at a friendly lead the Duchess of DILLWATER is giving at such
a dear little public she's discovered in Whitechapel, so we may be
rather late.... You'll keep a handkerchief-throw for me if you _do_
come on, won't you?... It will have to be an _extra_, then, I'm
afraid.... Are you goin' to Lord BALMISYDE'S eight o'clock breakfast
to-morrow? _So_ glad; I hear he's engaged five coffee-stalls, and
we're all to stand up and eat saveloys and trotters and thick
bread and butter.... Oh, I wanted to ask you, my girls have got an
invitation to a hoky-poky party the VAVASOURS are giving after the
moke-ridin' next Thursday, and I'm told it's quite wrong to eat
hoky-poky with a spoon--do you know how that is?... The only _correct_
way, CAROLINE, is to lick it out of the glass, which requires practice
before it can be _attempted_ in public. But I hear there's quite a
pleasant boy-professor somewhere in the Mile End Road who teaches it
in a single lesson; he's _very_ moderate; his terms are only half a
guinea, which includes the hoky-poky. I'll send you his address if I
can find it.... Thanks _so_ much; the dear girls _will_ be so grateful
to you.... I _do_ think it's _quite_ too bad of Lady GERALDINE
GRABBER, she goes and sticks her card on the only decent wooden horse
in the steam-circus and says she's engaged it for the whole time,
though she hardly ever takes a round! And so many girls standing
out who can ride without getting in the _least_ giddy!... Rathah a
boundah, that fellow, if you ask me; I've _seen_ him pullin' a swing
boat in brown boots and ridin'-breeches!... How wonderfully well your
daughter throws the rings, dear Lady CORNELIA, I hear she's won three
walking-sticks and five clasp knives.... You're very kind. She is
quite clever at it; but then she's had some private coaching from a
gipsy, don't you know.... What are you going to do with yourself this
afternoon?... Oh, I'm going to the People's Palace to see the finals
played off for the Skittles Championship; bound to be a closish thing;
rather excitin', don't you know.... Ah, Duchess, you've been in form
to-day, I see, five cocoa-nuts! Can I relieve you of some of them?...
Thanks, they _are_ rather tiresome to carry; if you _could_ find my
carriage and tell the footman to keep his eye on them. [_&c. &c._].

_Lady Rosehugh_ (_to_ Mr. LUKE WALMER, _on the way home_). You know I
_do_ think it's _such_ a cheering sign of the times, Society getting
simpler in its tastes, and sharing the pleasures of the Dear People,
and all that; it must tend to bring all classes more _together_, don't
you know!

_Mr. Luke Walmer._ Perhaps. Only I was thinking, I don't remember
seeing any of the Dear People _about_.

_Lady Rosehugh._ No; somebody was telling me they had taken to playing
Polo on bicycles in Hyde Park. So extraordinary of them--a place
nobody ever goes _near_ now, you know!

THE LAST TOURNAMENT

(OF TENNIS--IN THE NORTH).

_By a Manchester Enthusiast of Tennis-onian Tastes and Hibernian
Sympathies._

    ["For once in a way the Northern Tournament, which has long
    boasted of being second only to Wimbledon, has not proved
    an unqualified success.... The withdrawal of Messrs. PIM and
    STOKER must for some time be severely felt by tournaments of
    first-class importance."--_Bradford Observer._]

  Of Tennis in the North,
  Sing the--more or less--renown!
  But--some champions of worth
  From the netted lists are flown;
  The Great Brethren from the verdant courts are gone!
  Once they mustered a brave band,
  LAWFORD long, and LEWIS grand,
  Whilst the RENSHAWS, hand o'er hand,
  Smashed--and won!

  Now the other--BADDELEY--twins
  Have it nearly their own way;
  And they score repeated wins,
  Though the ALLENS, too, can play,
  And can send a swift one down the centre line.
  When those twins are on the job
  It is little use to lob.
  Then there's BARLOW,--bet your bob
  _He_ is fine!

  But the might of England flush'd
  In those courts of emerald sheen.
  WILFRID flew, and H. B. rush'd.--
  Oh! the wearing of the Green!--
  Where is Irish PIM, where STOKER, that great gun?
  Though they smashed and volley'd madly,
  The Hibernians murmured sadly,
  "Faix! Auld Erin's beaten--BADDELEY
  At this fun!"

  Then there's sweet Miss DOD again!
  Oh, how sad it seems, and odd.
  To survey the chalk-marged plain
  In the absence of Miss DOD,
  Who they say is wholly given up to GOLF!!!
  Shall the links then lick the Court?
  Tennis champions run short?
  And the slaves of the Scotch sport
  Jeer and scoff?

  True MAHONEY and Miss MARTIN
  Did their best our sport to save;
  And Miss COOPER took stout part
  In mixed doubles--which was brave:
  But where was Mrs. HILLYARD, "whom we knew?"
  (As Ulysses said of him
  In the Shades.) Oh, STOKER, PIM!
  E'en bright Manchester looked dim
  Missing you!

  Still, joy, Old England, raise!
  For the tidings of your might!
  Yet we hope that Golfing craze
  Will not come, like a big blight,
  And seduce our DODS and RENSHAWS any more.
  For to mar the sweet content
  Of our Northern Tournament,
  By much time on links misspent
  Were a Bore!!!

"THE SEELEY LECTURERS."--We have a wholesome dread of lecturers
generally. Perhaps the more learned the lecturer, the greater the
boredom to the listeners, specially if the latter be frivolously
inclined. But in any case, if lectures must be, then we would rather
hear a _Wise_ lecturer than a _Seeley_ one. On second thoughts, the
only entertaining Seeley Lecturer that we know is the one at the Zoo,
who discourses on, while exhibiting, the seal.

SCRAPS FROM CHAPS.

Mr. H. T. WADDY, the Liberal Candidate, has been telling the voters
of the Truro-Helston division of Cornwall stories about those wicked
publicans. At one of the bye elections they got out posters, which
read, "If you vote for the Liquor Traffic Bill, this house will
be closed," and displayed them in their premises. But the Radical
humorist was on the warpath, and, having provided himself with copies
of the poster, attached them to the respective doors of the prison,
the lunatic asylum, and the workhouse. This was quite excellent. But
Mr. WADDY might have carried the joke a little further, say as far as
London. There, at all events, the Bill may possibly lead to the early
closing of one public house, where business has for some time been in
a very bad way. This would of course be a source of great satisfaction
to Mr. WADDY--and his leaders.

In connection with the course of lectures given at Truro by Mrs.
THWAITES, principal of the Liverpool School of Cookery, a large
Company recently dined in the Concert Hall, at the invitation of the
directors of the Truro Gas Company, when the advantages of cooking by
gas were put to practical test. Truly there be epicures at Truro who
know what's what. Cooking by G. A. S. must have been a great success,
and Truro will look forward to a repetition of this cook's excursion.
In any case, it will have added to the list of the good things it has
seen and people it has known.

BUBBLES from the BALTIC.

BLOWN FROM THE PIPE OF TOBY. M.P.

[Illustration]

_Off the Elbe, Wednesday Afternoon._--Got up steam, weighed anchor
and laid our course East by North half South for Hamburg. Don CURRIE,
whose knowledge of ocean life is extensive and peculiar, tells me no
well regulated ship puts to sea without first ascertaining the weight
of her anchor. Much interested at this peep into nautical life.
But what has the weight of the anchor to do with the voyage of the
_Tantallon Castle_, or even with the opening of the Baltic Canal?
Well, the Don is not sure. Anyhow, it is an old custom. Sailors are
superstitious, and if this preliminary to a voyage were omitted, they
would turn rusty, and might even want to throw someone overboard.
So, to prevent possible unpleasantness, the anchor is weighed--"To an
ounce," Don CURRIE says severely.

Suppose before we turn in we shall be told how much it weighs. Wish I
knew what is the average weight of a really good anchor. So awkward if
a man comes upon you suddenly, and says "The anchor weighs just over
a ton"; or "What do you think? the anchor turns the scale at fifty-two
lbs. ten dwt." Is one too much, and is the other surprisingly little?
Haven't the slightest idea. Shall, in either case, say "Ha!" That is,
at any rate, noncommittal.

Mr. G. will know what an anchor ought to weigh in given circumstances.
He knows everything. Shall try and find opportunity of asking him.

_Hamburg, Friday_, 5 A.M.--"I am very fond of the German tongue,"
said the Member for SARK, paying me an early morning pyjama-call. "The
language in which GOETHE wrote and HEINE sang is sacred. Still, when
it is emitted from the throats of half a score of steam-whistles, one
feels there are limits to passionate desire. Have often heard siren
song of steam-whistle in and about the Thames. That's bad enough for
the sensitive ear. But when it comes to steam-whistling in German, you
begin to understand why people sometimes commit suicide."

For my part, I like it. Few things more charming than to be wakened at
daybreak by a steam-whistle spluttering in your larboard ear. Before
you have quite drank in the fulness of the music, another shrieks in
your starboard ear. Then, far and near, all round the harbour,
they pop off in different keys. Some angry; some whining; some
in anguishing pain; some mocking; some wailing; one ingenious
contrivance, moved by a master-hand, managing to imitate a burst
of maniacal laughter, in which, if you didn't bury your head in the
pillow, you feel you must join.

Then there's the effect on the man on deck. Don't know who he is;
fancy he must be the Supercargo. At first shriek of the earliest
whistle, he puts on the heaviest boots (those with the clump of steel
at the toes, the wedges of iron at the heel, and fat-headed nails all
over the sole). He gives preliminary stamp precisely over your head;
all right; steam-whistle shrieks; others respond; Supercargo is off;
stamps to and fro just the length of the deck immediately over your
berth; leaps up height of two feet; drops exactly over your head;
steam-whistles go faster; Supercargo clatters off; fetches from
somewhere a plank, a rough-hewn plank studded with nails; this he
dashes on the deck over your head; got the range to a nicety; never
misses; steam-whistles go off simultaneously; maddening effect on
Supercargo; he rages to and fro, charges over your berth, banging the
plank with mad delight. You get out of your berth, dash to side; just
going to plunge over; when Quartermaster seizes you and leads you back
to cabin, locking you in.

And SARK says he doesn't care for early morning effects in Hamburg
harbour!

_Saturday Morning._--Steaming down Elbe, meaning to anchor at its
mouth. (Not at its elbow, as SARK told the pilot. Pilot didn't
see joke. Stared at him, and said, "_Hein?_" which made SARK look
foolish.) Last night citizens of Hamburg entertained us at dinner.
Banquet spread in what they call the Zoologischer Garten. Odd how
the way of pronouncing a familiar word grows upon some people after
dinner.

Feeding time seven. No extra charge to the public, who are kept
outside. Excellent dinner; but general arrangement more suited to time
of Methuselah than our shorter-lived day. Sat down at 7.30; finished
by 11.30. Peculiarity of _menu_ was the interpolation of cold
speeches among the hot dishes. As soon as we swallowed our _Klare
Schildkroetensuppe_, and toyed with our _Forellen, blau mit Butter_,
Chairman rose and proposed toast to Emperor. Next came on the table
(sideways, of course) _Helgolaender hummer auf amerikanische Art_.
Before the dish was removed, another gentleman on his legs proposing
health of Mr. G. So on through the meal: first a bite and sup, then a
speech. Practice interesting, though apt to induce a coolness on
part of some of the dishes. Suppose cook calculates that gentlemen
proposing particular toast will speak for ten minutes; he takes
twenty, or, if of a fearless nature, half an hour. Where's your next
dish? Why, cold or burnt. Nor can system be recommended on score of
economy. Consequence of sitting through four hours dining off sort
of speech-sandwich, is that you begin to get hungry again. The
absent-minded man, offered an ice, says he usually begins his dinner
with soup. If two hundred follow his example, and insist upon going
all through the dinner again, it is not only embarrassing, but becomes
costly.

_Off Jutland, Sunday._--Don CURRIE last night gave return banquet on
_Tantallon Castle_ to Hamburgers. Done in princely style. Over two
hundred sat down in brilliantly lighted saloon. Had our speeches,
as usual with _nous autres_, served with the dessert instead of as
_entrees_. Few, short, pithy, and one historical. Don CURRIE proposed
toasts to his fellow Sovereigns, the Queen of ENGLAND and Emperor
of GERMANY. Burgomaster of Hamburg toasted Mr. G., who responded in
speech, lofty in sentiment, eloquently simple, admirable in delivery.
Dog and pup, I have, during the last twenty years, heard nearly every
one of his great speeches in the House and out. Declare that in all
the qualities that go to make a perfect oration, it would be hard for
even his record to beat this impromptu speech, delivered amid such
strange surroundings.

After dinner, a dance on deck. The waltzing and polkaing commonplace
enough. But pretty to see JOHN LENG, M.P., and the LORD OF THE ISLES do
a sword dance, whilst RAMSAY, M.P., like them, clad in national garb,
played the bagpipes. This struck the German guests more than anything.
Their papers full of it.

_Copenhagen, Tuesday._--King and Queen of DENMARK, with rest of
Royal Family, had day out to-day. Came aboard _Tantallon Castle_ for
luncheon.

"You talk about your Roshervilles, _cher_ TOBEE," his Majesty said, as
we smoked cigars with our coffee; "but to my mind, the place to spend
a happy day is the _Tantallon Castle_."

"There is," I said, "the drawback of the absence of shrimps. But then
even kings cannot have everything."

"True, TOBEE," said the grandfather of our kings-to-be and of other
people's. And for a moment the royal brow was "sicklied o'er with pale
cast of thought."

It cleared as he caught sight of our two rival Kodakesses, who had
simultaneously got him in focus. Pretty to see King arrange his hair,
give little twist to moustache, and assume look of abstraction, just
as common people do when they suspect someone is taking a snap-shot at
them. As SARK says, "One snap of the Kodak makes the whole world kin."

Oddly enough, there were speeches at the luncheon. Mr. G. having got
his hand (or rather his voice) in at mouth of the Elbe, delivered
two charming addresses. One in proposing health of King and Queen of
DENMARK, the other in responding to toast to his own health, given
by King. A new thing this for Old Parliamentary Hand to serve as
after-dinner speaker. Listening to his graceful, gracious phrases,
one almost regrets he should have given up so much time to Irish Land
Bills, Home Rule, and the like.

After luncheon a stroll on deck, and, incidentally, a memorable scene.
In addition to the Kodakesses, who have taken everyone on board,
except each other, we have a regular artist with a camera. Don CURRIE,
having a moment to spare, thought he would have his likeness taken.
Got into position; operator's head under the cloth fixing him; in
another moment it would have been done. As SHAKSPEARE wrote long ago,
"Nothing escapes the eye of royal Denmark." The King, seeing what was
going on, quietly led up the Queen, and stood by her in focus; the
rest of the Royal Family, as our toast lists have it, closed in,
forming a group near the Don; and when the astonished operator removed
the cap and exposed the plate he found upon it the Royal Family
of Denmark and one simple Highland gentleman distinguished in such
company by his plain estate.

In afternoon, Don CURRIE having entertained Kings and Queens and Crown
Princes, threw open all the gangways of the ship to the people of
Copenhagen. They flocked in by hundreds, increasing to thousands. In
endless streams they passed along the decks peering and poking their
noses into every nook and cranny. On upper deck they had a great find.
Sitting in his state cabin, with door open, was Mr. G. reading about
the Vikings in their own tongue, which he has lately added to his list
of acquired foreign languages. The Danes, men, women, and children,
stood there at gaze. Mr. G., with his back turned to door, read on,
unnoticing. Crowd growing unmanageable with ever-increasing numbers,
a handy quartermaster rigged out ropes, and made sort of handrail,
guarding either side of cabin, keeping back crowd. But it filled the
deck all through the afternoon, ever changing, but ever one in its
passionate, yet patient desire to catch a glimpse of that figure in
the cabin, that went on reading as if the world outside were a mere
wilderness.

[Illustration: An admirable spot for a little quiet reading, although
perhaps the firing does make it a leetle difficult to concentrate
one's thoughts wholly upon the matter in hand.]

_Wednesday._--At Kiel. Harbour and approaches filled with fleets of
all nations, every ship bristling with guns, and longing to be at
somebody. For the closing years of the nineteenth century of the
Christian Era, this is, as SARK says, most encouraging. It is the
completest achievement, the proudest thing civilisation has to show
us.

THE LEADING MOTIVE OF THE "W. O.," WITH VARIATIONS.

_The General Idea_ (_supplied at Pall Mall_). That, although the
British Army costs (exclusive of extras) L57 per man, the War Office
is the best _bureau_ in the world. The establishments over which the
Secretary of State and the Commander-in-Chief preside, are necessarily
incapable of improvement, as they are absolutely perfect. This being
so, nothing more need, can, and should be said.

_Commentary No. 1_ (_supplied by Printing House Square_). That the
General Idea of the War Office is ridiculous. That were Pall Mall to
be occupied by the staff of a merchant's office, the nation would be
saved millions, and the L57 (exclusive of extras) per man arrangement
would soon be regarded as an extravagant product of the wasteful past.

_Commentary No. 2_ (_supplied by a military writer_). That civilians
cannot possibly know anything about the working of a Government
Office. As Pall Mall says it is perfect, it is to be presumed that it
is. Why not leave well alone? And as for L57 (exclusive of extras) per
man, why, is not that arrangement less than L60?

_Commentary No. 3_ (_supplied anonymously_). Opinion of military
writer not worth the paper containing it. Look abroad. Does the
foreign service cost L57 per man, exclusive of extras? Not at all.
Then what can be done on the Continent, can, and should be done in
England.

_Commentary No. 4_ (_supplied by the working-classes_). What! pay, L57
(exclusive of extras) for a soldier? Much better abolish the Army, and
reduce the price of beer!

_Commentary No. 5 and last_ (_supplied by_ Private THOMAS ATKINS).
What, I cost L57 a year, exclusive of extras! Well, all I can say is,
that precious little of the money or the perquisites gets into _my_
pockets! Worse luck to it!

The German EMPEROR having expressed a wish to visit a non-existing
island at Hamburg, the tasteful citizens have constructed one by means
of wirework, canvas, plaster, and cement.

It is stated that the SULTAN is bored by the Bosphorus. The whole
surface of the water will therefore be covered with planks, painted
green, to represent meadows.

The KING of the BELGIANS is said to have remarked that Brussels would
be improved by a distant view of the sea. The municipal authorities
propose to cover the high ground, seen from the palace windows,
with tin-foil. It is hoped that this will give the effect of the sea
gleaming in the sunshine.

The PRESIDENT of the French Republic having thought that it would be
a pleasing compliment to Russia if some specimens of Russian
architecture could be erected in Paris, it is believed that the
_Commission des Monuments Historiques_ will cover the Louvre with
laths and canvas, painted to represent the Kremlin, and by similar
means will transform the Champs Elysees into the Nevsky Prospect, and
will give to Notre Dame the appearance of the forts at Cronstadt.

The KHEDIVE has expressed an opinion that the Pyramids look old
and shabby. If the English and French government will authorise the
expenditure, the whole surface of the stone will be made perfectly
smooth, will be painted and grained in imitation of oak, and will
finally be varnished. The face of the Sphinx will be washed, and will
then be used for an advertisement of an English soap. The enormous
rent paid for this will be added to the KHEDIVE'S pocket money.

The Queen of HOLLAND is dissatisfied with the flat surroundings of the
Hague. It has been pointed out to HER MAJESTY that the city contains
a hill, called, we believe, the Vijverberg, which rises at least three
feet above the level of the sea, but she has replied that this is not
enough. It is therefore proposed to surround the whole city with a
gigantic panorama of the Bernese Oberland.

The other day the King of SPAIN perceived a reflection of the moon in
a pond, and was much annoyed when his attendants failed to bring it to

shall contain an aluminium moon, which can be pulled out by a
specially appointed Grandee of Spain, if commanded by HIS MAJESTY.

The Witness Protection Society and General Legal Reform Union has been

estimable body the chief appears to be to protect witnesses in law
courts from insult by counsel. Captain PARKIS, having expressed

down to have a good time. "Heated discussion," "further disturbance,"
and a well-sustained fire of "protests," lent an air of gaiety to

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.

Messrs. ARKWRIGHT, CUNLIFFE, and WARNER have received their blues from
the Captain of the Oxford University Eleven. In other words, these
gentlemen will help to represent their University in the cricket match
against Cambridge. My congratulations, though they come late, are none
the less hearty and sincere. Can any years of success in after life
efface the memory or outrival the delight of that crowded moment of
glorious life which comes to a young man when his Captain tells him he
may get his blue? Thenceforward he is made one with the great company
of old blues, who year by year meet and exchange reminiscences, the
honour of his University is in his hands, his father becomes less
rigorous in his financial views, and his mother is confirmed in her
opinion that her darling is the brightest and best and handsomest of
created beings. These keen joys come but once in a lifetime, and only
to a few.

  To this tricky left-handed young bowler his blue.

  And he promptly scored one as he pulled out Plum WARNER.

When I was a freshman at Cambridge (_eheu fugaces!_) I remember being
both impressed and terrified at having pointed out to me a tutor of
a certain College who was said to be the hero of a Bacchanalian
incident. The story went that the tutor, returning from some feast
with a party of friends, fell, by mischance, into one of the narrow
streams of water that flow at the side of the Cambridge streets.
Striking out vigorously, he shouted, "Save the rest, I can swim." No
doubt the story is still told, for the supposed hero of it is still
alive. Indeed, when a caricature of him was published some years ago
in _Vanity Fair_, the biography by JEHU JUNIOR closed with the words,
"He can swim." Yet the story, as affecting Mr. DASH, of Blank College,
is manifestly false, for it is older than the century. The curious may
find it in its original form in the lately published volume of S. T.
COLERIDGE'S letters. The poet relates it of an undergraduate of his
day who had taken part in a drunken revel.

       *       *       *       *       *

But the ways of stories are at all times inscrutable. I have myself--I
confess it without a blush--deliberately invented and spread abroad a
story about a semi-public dinner. I did so merely because it struck
me as containing elements of humour. Besides, it not only might
have happened, but ought to have happened. A year or two later six
gentlemen, who had been present when the incident did not occur,
related it back to me, each one with a little special embellishment of
his own. Some of them were magistrates, most of them were fathers of
families, and all were honourable men. Yet they were all prepared to
stake their reputations on the absolute veracity of this myth; and,
what is even more curious, they retailed it to its inventor and
disseminator.

Lytham is troubled. I read that "the musical attractions at the Pier
Pavilion have been fairly patronised, and dancing on the pier is to
be resumed." This latter attraction, it appears, has not met with the
entire approval of the Lytham people, who contend that it will bring
Lytham into disrepute. "The Ratepayers' Association have had the
matter under consideration, and have disclaimed any connection with
the innovation. The directors, however, have had the question under
discussion, and have decided to continue the dancing."

       *       *       *       *       *

  Said the pier-man to the tourist, "Lo, the tide is flowing free;
  Won't you come and join the dancers in our Temple by the sea?
  See how mazily the Harries and the Harriets advance,
  Will you won't you, will you won't you, won't you join the dance?

  "We have cornets, flutes and fiddles, and we always play in time,
  And the triangles at intervals triangularly chime.
  Hark, the bold bassoon is booming, every dancer gets a chance,
  Come and trip it, pretty tourist, in our gay Pavilion dance."

  But the tourist paused a moment; then addressed the pier-man,
          "Brute,
  Such proceedings bring poor Lytham into awful disrepute,
  Besides, I'm here for pleasure, and I do not want to prance.
  As the rest of them are doing, in your gay _al fresco_ dance."

  And the ratepayers considered it, and angrily replied,
  "There is another shore, you know, upon the other side:
  Take your dancers far from England, take them bodily to France;
  We disclaim the least connection, and we will not join your dance."

I note from a correspondence in _The Scotsman_ that a considerable
amount of feeling has been aroused by the erection of the new North
British Railway Hotel in Princes Street. Lord WEMYSS, apparently, has
declared not only that it will spoil the view, but also that it will
"pierce the vault of heaven." Another correspondent adds that it
will have "a Jennerised, unreposeful front." That ought to settle
the matter at once. Someone else complains of "those terrible
advertisements of drugs and fluid beef which extend in gigantic
letters along the side of the lower part of the Carlton Hill, and
which catch the unwilling eye of anyone looking from the Bridges,
from the Mound, and indeed from any part of the Old Town." What with
advertisements of drugs and fluid beef, and a new hotel possessing a
Jennerised, unreposeful front, obviously Edinburgh is in a bad way.

Mr. C. J. WALTON, of Wolverhampton, writes to the _Birmingham Daily
Gazette_ with reference to a recent appeal on behalf of the victims
of the "Liberator" frauds. "I fail entirely to see," he says, "how a
member of the Church of England can be expected to make the slightest
sacrifice (except on the principle of Christian charity), seeing that
the whole idea of the 'Liberator' scheme was to find funds for the
agitators whose sole aim was the robbery and destruction of the Church
of England as a national institution, and to get hold of its funds for
secular and non-religious purposes." Dear me, dear me, how strange,
how terrible, how muddle-headed. This poor politician has evidently
got mixed up between the Liberator and the "Liberation Society." Let
him take the hint, and send in his subscription.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.

_The Convict Ship_, CLARK RUSSEL'S latest novel (CHATTO AND WINDUS),
is redolent of the sea. There is no writer, not forgetting MARRYAT,
who has such close companionship with the sea in its multiple
forms and its many moods. The temptation to transfer some of the
ever-varying pictures of the sea which sparkle in these pages is great
but must be resisted. Here is a glimpse of night at sea, chosen not
because it is best, but because it is shortest:--

    "The mighty shadow of the ocean night was majestic and awful,
    with the wild, flashful colouring of lightning in the south,
    and the dustlike multitude of stars over the three glooming
    spires of our ship."

[Illustration]

One would suppose that, sitting down to write, CLARK RUSSELL had
just come home from a long trip foreign, or at least lived his life
somewhere within sight and sound of the sea. The pity of it is, my
Baronite tells me, that this incomparable student of the sea, of ships
that go down upon the waters, and of those who people them, lies at
anchor on his sofa in an inland town. He has not looked upon the sea
for a dozen years, nor smelt its brine, nor watched a ship coming or
going. This makes the more marvellous the power of description of
sea life in all its forms here displayed. Beyond this special gift,
fascinating to some people, Mr. RUSSELL has a story to tell, a good
stout sea story, full of life and adventure, through the devious
movements of which we meet real men and one woman. Remembering that
CLARK RUSSELL now ranks as a veteran novelist, it is pleasant to bear
testimony to the fact that he seems to have saved his best wine to the
last. _The Convict Ship_ is, take it from stem to stern, the best work
he has yet turned out.

"N.B."--Glasgow will have to look after its parks. Here is the Town
Council actually dreaming of "feuing" some of "the recently-acquired
Camphill grounds" for building purposes! These grounds belong to the
people, and adjoin the South Side Park, and "the amenity of that park
would be destroyed" by building operations. One protester says South
Side Park is the prettiest in Glasgow, and "more like the London
parks, which I regard as the finest in the kingdom." Thanks, worthy
Scot! The view of it, "as seen through the railings in the Pollokshaws
Road," reminds him of "the fine view of Hyde Park which is to be
had through the railing in that busy and lovely thoroughfare--Oxford
Street." Thanks again, thrice worthy Pict! But Oxford Street a "lovely
thoroughfare"--well! At any rate, the Glasgow Bailies when next they
are disposed to "feu," should think of the "Many" instead.

  Our Kiel grow, our Kiel grow,
  With ships from sea to sea, O!

  "The Vaterland reposes,
  As though on beds of roses,
  Whilst we hold up our noses,
  Among the Naval Powers, O!
  Merry may our Kiel grow, &c.

Mr. F. J. HORNIMAN, F.R.G.S., tea-merchant, has accepted the
invitation to oppose Mr. CAVENDISH BENTINCK, Conservative M.P.,
for the united borough of Penryn, Flushing, and Falmouth. It is
anticipated, says the _Western Daily Mercury_, that he will make a
good candidate. Certainly he ought to be able to suit the constituency
to a T, unless it continues faithful to its CAVENDISH, in which case
his candidature will end in smoke. Mr. HORNIMAN, no doubt, hopes for
an early general election, because the longer he stands the greater
prospect of his getting what schoolboys call a "tannin'."

CHATS WITH THE CHILDREN.

A COMIC RAILWAY JOURNEY.

_Miss Prunes-Prism._ And now, my dear charges, I trust you have
utilised the hour that has been hypothecated to enjoyment profitably.

_Emily._ Indeed we have, dear governess. I have read to my brother and
sister a most amusing account of a railway traveller who wished to
get from Bangor to Euston in five hours, and was baffled in the
well-intentioned attempt by the clever ingenuity of the railway
companies!

_Miss Prunes-Prism._ You refer, no doubt, to the gentleman who, having
left Bangor at 7.55, reached Llandudno at 8.5, Colwyn Bay at 8.41,
Abergele at 8.52, Rhyl at 9.2, and Chester at 9.56.

_Margaret._ Yes, dear Miss PRUNES-PRISM; and it is at that point the
fun of the railway companies came in. Having arrived at 9.56 he found
that the train for London had already left. It was timed to depart for
the metropolis exactly one minute before the arrival of his train at
9.55!

_Emily._ Indeed, dear governess, the story is vastly entertaining.
Then there is a similar arrangement at Crewe Junction. At that centre
of popularity a train arrives from a provincial source at 10.48, just
one minute later than the advertised time for the departure of the
London train. Those who have the framing of these traffic arrangements
must be wags of the first water!

_Miss Prunes-Prism._ No doubt they are. And now, my dear CHARLES,
supposing your dear papa wished to get from Bangor to Euston, what
would you advise him to do?

_Charles._ I should recommend him to walk.

_Miss Prunes-Prism._ I think, my dear child, that your counsel would
be sound. And now, my dear charges, having enjoyed our chat, let
us return with renewed energy to the consideration of the principal
incidents of _Magna Charta_.

    [In the first innings of the Jubilee Match, "I Zingari
    _versus_ Gentlemen of England," W. G. GRACE, Sen., scored 34,
    and W. G. GRACE, Jun., 79].

  Says the young W. G. to the old W. G.,
  "Seventy-nine, my potent pater, Seventy-nine!"
  Says the old W. G. to the young W. G.,
  "That beats mine, sonny WILLIAM, that beats mine!

  _How_ we used to run the score up, he and I, long ago!
  But I told you you would do it, if you only dared stick _to_ it;

There has been much excitement in Sheffield about the School Board.
The unsectarian party had a chance of converting a minority of one
into a majority of the same extent, owing to the retirement of one
Church member, and the serious illness of another, Father BURKE,
who was thereby prevented from attending the Board meeting for the
election of a new member. Mr. CHARLES HOBSON, however, refused to take
advantage of an accident to reverse for the next two years and a half
the policy of the Board laid down by a majority of the ratepayers, and
chose what he considered the better part of pairing with Father BURKE.
Therefore was the chairman enabled to give a casting vote in favour of
the Church candidate. But "Hobson's Choice" has not pleased his
candid friends, who think, and say, that it is "not war," nor even
magnificent. The blades must needs keep up the credit of their native
place by making cutting remarks. They come from Sheffield.

       *       *       *       *       *

Who Threw It?

  Joy in the Church, confusion in the chapel,
  And contradictory clamour everywhere!
  It may be questioned if the Eris-apple
  Gendered more strife than "Mr. GLADSTONE'S Pair."

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
