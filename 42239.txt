Transcriber's note:

      This text file is intended for users whose text readers cannot
      display the Unicode/UTF-8 version. The oe-ligature is displayed
      as "oe." One Greek phrase is shown in transliteration between
      number signs (#O thea#).

      The Gairdner edition of the Paston Letters was printed in six
      volumes. Each volume is a separate e-text; Volume VI is further
      divided into two e-texts, Letters and Index. Volume I, the
      General Introduction, will be released after all other volumes,
      matching the original publication order.

      Except for footnotes and sidenotes, all brackets are in the
      original, as are parenthetical question marks and (_sic_)
      notations. Series of dots representing damaged text are shown
      as in the printed original.

      The year was shown in a sidenote at the top of each page; this
      has been merged with the sidenote at the beginning of each
      Letter or Abstract.

      A carat character is used to denote superscription. The
      character(s) following the carat is superscripted (example:
      vj^ti). Braces { } are used only when the superscripted
      text is immediately followed by non-superscripted letters
      or period (full stop). Subscripts (rare) are shown with
      single lines _.Errata and other transcriber's notes are
      shown in [[double brackets]].

      Footnotes have their original numbering, with added page
      number to make them usable with the full Index. They are
      grouped at the end of each Letter or Abstract.

      Typographical errors are listed at the end of each Letter,
      after the footnotes. In the primary text, errors were only
      corrected if they are clearly editorial, such as missing
      italics, or mechanical, such as u-for-n misprints. Italic
      "d" misprinted as "a" was a recurring problem, especially
      in Volume IV. The word "invisible" means that there is
      an appropriately sized blank space, but the letter or
      punctuation mark itself is missing. The form "corrected
      by author" refers to the Errata printed at the end of the
      Letters, in Volume VI.

      Specifics: The spelling "Jhon" is not an error. Gresham and
      Tresham are different people. Conversely, the inconsistent
      spelling of the name "Lipyate" or "Lipgate" in footnotes is
      unchanged. In this volume, the spelling "apostyle" for
      "apostille" is used consistently.

      Note that the printed book used z to represent original small
      letter yogh. This has not been changed for the e-text.

  _Endorsed_: Th'Erle off Oxenfford.

    [Footnote 5-1: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] It will be seen by No.
    690, that in October 1468 the Duchess of Suffolk had a design of
    suddenly entering the manor of Cotton and dispossessing Sir John
    Paston. This letter, in which it is said she proposes to hold a
    court there, was probably written in the beginning of the
    following year.]

ABSTRACT[6-1]

[Sidenote: 1469 / JAN. 9]

W. COTING to JOHN COOK, draper of Norwich, 'and that he deliver or send
this bill to Richard Kalle in all goodly haste, for the matter is of
substance.'

This day in the grey morning three men of my Lord of Norfolk with long
spears carried off three good horses from John Poleyn, 'one of your
farmers at Tichewell,' telling him to treat with my Lord of Norfolk.
Wishes to know what to do, 'for such an open wrong unremedied knew I
never.' Saturday after Epiphany.

'Anno viij^o' is written below.

[The signature of this letter is written in an abbreviated form, 'W.
Cot.' According to Blomefield, W. Cotyng was rector of Titchwell from
1450 to 1457, and he had been previously rector of Swainsthorp, to which
he was presented by Judge Paston in 1444. This letter is twelve years
later than the date at which his incumbency of Titchwell is said to have
terminated; but doubtless he is the writer. He is referred to as living
even in the year 1485, in a letter written by Dame Elizabeth Browne, who
says that he and James Gresham were clerks to her father Judge Paston.]

EDWARD IV. TO SIR JOHN PASTON[6-2]

_To our trusty and welbeloved Sir John Paston, Knight._

BY THE KINGE.

[Sidenote: 1469 / JAN. 18]

Trusty and welbeloved, we grete yow well. And how be it that we late
addressed unto yow our letters, and commanded yow by the same, for the
consideracions in them conteined, to have ceased of makinge any
assemblye of our people for the matter of variance dependinge betwixt
yow on that one partie, and our right trustie and right entirely beloved
cosin the Duke of Norffolk on that other, and to have appeared before
the Lords of our Councell at our Palleys of Westminster at a certeine
day in our said letters specified; yett nevertheless we understonde not
as yet if ye have conformed yow to the performinge of our said
commandement or not. We therefore eftsones write unto yow, willing and
straitly charging yow to cease of the said ryotts and assemblies; and
that incontinent upon the sight of these our letters that ye dispose yow
personally to appear afore the said Lords of our Councell at our said
Pallis, there to answere to such thinges as in that behalfe by them
shall be laid and objected against yow, not failinge hereof, all excuses
laid aparte, as ye will avoide our displeasure. Yeven under our signet
at our citye of Salesbury, the xviij. day of January.

    [Footnote 6-2: This letter is reprinted from the Paston Genealogy
    in the _Norfolk Archaeology_, to which we have already several
    times referred (_see_ Nos. 484, 641, 643, etc.). Edward IV. was at
    Salisbury in January 1469, one of his privy seals being dated
    there on the 16th of the month.]

    [Footnote 7-1: [Add. MS. 34,889, f. 186.] This letter was probably
    written after the death of John Paston, the writer's father, but
    the precise year is uncertain.]

[Sidenote: 1469 / MARCH 12]

I grete you wele and send you Goddes blyssyng and myn, desiryng you to
recomaund me to my brother William, and to comune with hym and your
councell in such materis as I wryght to you, that ther may be purveyd be
some writyng fro the Kyng that my Lord of Norffolk and his councell seas
[_cease_] of the wast that thei done in your lordsheps, and in especiall
at Heynford; for thei have felled all the wood, and this weke thei wull
carie it a wey, and lete renne the wateris and take all the fyssh. And
Sir William Yelverton and his sone William, John Grey and Burgeys,
William Yelvertons men, have ben at Guton and takyn distresses, and with
ought that [_unless_] thei wull pay them thei shall not set ought no
plow to till there lande; thei byd them lete there land lye on tilled
but if [_unless_] thei pay them. So that if the tenauntes have no remedy
that thei may pesibily, with ought assaught or distresse takyng, be the
seid Yelverton or his men, or of any other in there names, at there
liberte herye there landis, with in this vij. days there tylth in the
feldis be lost for all this yere and thei shall be on doon; and though
ye shuld kepe it here after pesibilly ye shuld lese the ferme of this
yere, for thei may not pay you but if [_unless_] thei may occupie there
landis; thei set not so sone a plow ought at ther gatis but ther is a
felesship redy to take it. And thei ride with speris and launyegays,
like men of werre, so that the seid tenauntis arn a ferd to kepe there
owyn howses. Therfore purvey an redy remedy, or ellis ye lese the
tenauntis hertis and ye gretly hurt; for it is gret pety to here the
swemefull[10-2] and petowse compleyntis of the pore tenauntis that come
to me for comfort and socour sometime vi. or vij. to geder. Therfore,
for Goddis love, se that thei ben helpyn, and desire my brothere William
to geve you good concell here.

Also it is told me that my Lady of Suffolk hath promysed you here good
will, if your bargayn of the mariage[11-1] holdyth, to do as largely as
she shall be disired, or largelyer if there be any appoyntment takyn a
twix you for any materes a twyx her and you. And [_i.e._ if] thei wuld
avyse you to geve any money to here to make here refuse or disclayme
here titill, me semyth ye may wele excuse you be the money that she had
last, and be the wrongis that were don be here and here men in fellyng
of wood and pullyng doune of your place and logge at Heylesdon, and
takyn a wey of the shep and your faderis goodis, which were takyn a wey
at the pullyn don of the seid place; wheche wele considered, she were
wurthy to recompense you. And [_if_] the Kyng and the lordis were wele
enformed thei wuld considere the redilyer your hurtis. It semyth this
Sir William Yelverton hath comfort that he is so bold, for [he[11-2]]
hath ryght prowde and fowle langage and ryght slaundrows to the
tenauntis, as thei have reported to me. Therfor be ryght ware that ye
bynde not your self nor mak non ensurance till ye be suer of a pesibill
possession of your lande; for oftyn tyme rape rueth, and whan a man hath
made such a covenante he must kepith it, he may not chese;
there[fore[11-2]] be not to hasty till your londe be clere. And labore
hastly a remedy for thes premysses, or ellis Sir John Fastolffis
lyvelode, though ye entre it pesibilly, shall not be worth to ye a grote
this yere with ought ye wull on do your tenauntis. I pray you remembre a
kerchye of Cremyll for your suster Anne. Remembre to labore some remedy
for your faderis will whill my Lord of Caunterbury[11-3] lyvyth, for he
is an old man and he is now frendly to you and if he happed to dye, how
[_who_] shuld come after hym ye wote never; and if he wer a nedy man, in
asmych as your fader was noysed of so greet valew he wull be the mor
straunge to entrete. And lete this be not for gete; for [if] ther were
on [_one_] that aught us no good wyll he myght calle us up to make
accounte of his goodis, and if we had not for to showe for us where by
we have occupied, he myght send doun assentence to curse us in all the
diosyse and to make us to delivere his goodis; which were to us a gret
shame, and a rebuke. There fore purvey hastly and wyssely therfore whill
he lyvyth, and do not as ye dede whill my Lord of York[12-1] was
Chanceller make delays, for if ye had labored in his tyme as ye have do
sith, ye had be thurgh in your materis; be ware be that, and lete slauth
nomor take you in such diffaught; thynk of after clappes and have
provysion in all your work, and ye shall do the better. God kepe you.
Wretyn on Myd Lent Sonday in hast.

    Paston writes to her son Sir John in the end of the last letter
    about his father's will, and also from what she says a little
    later about the Duchess of Suffolk (_see_ page 15), we may assign
    this document with great probability to the year 1469.]

    [Footnote 13-1: [From Fenn, iv. 308.] Sir Thomas Howes appears
    to have died in the latter part of the year 1468. Before the end
    of that year his living of Pulham was vacant, and his death is
    alluded to in a letter of Margaret Paston's, written on the 30th
    September 1469, as having occurred 'within this twelvemonth.' It
    would appear by the following extract, quoted by Fenn, from the
    Institution Books of the Bishop of Norwich, that Sir John's
    presentation referred to in this letter was not allowed, or was
    not made out in time, and that the Bishop presented by a lapse:--

MARGARET PASTON TO SIR JOHN PASTON[14-1]

_To Sir John Paston._

[Sidenote: 1469 / APRIL 3]

I grete you wele, and send you Godds blissyng and myn, thankyng you for
my seall that ye sent me; but I am right sory that ye dede so grete cost
ther up on, for on of xl_d._ should have served me right wele. Send me
ward what it cost you, and I shall send you money therfor. I send you a
letter be a man of Yarmoth; send me word if ye have it, for I marveyll
ye sent me non answer ther of be Juddy.

I have non very knowleche of your ensuraunce [_engagement_], but if ye
be ensured I pray God send you joy and wurchep to geder, and so I trost
ye shull have, if it be as it is reported of her[15-1]; and a nemps God,
ye arn as gretly bownd to her as ye were maried, and therfor I charge
you up on my blissyng, that ye be as trew to her as she wer maried on to
you in all degrees, and ye shall have the mor grace and the better spede
in all other thyngs.

Also, I wuld that ye shuld not be to hasty to be maried til ye wer more
suer of your lyvelode, for ye must remembr what charge ye shall have,
and if ye have not to mayntene it, it wull be gret rebuke; and therfor
labour that ye may have releses of the londs, and be in more suerte of
your lond, or than ye be maried.

The Duchesse of Suffolk[15-2] is at Ewhelm, in Oxford shir, and it is
thought be your frends her that it is do that she myght be ferr and
ought of the wey, and the rather feyne excuse be cause of age or
sikenesse, and if that the Kyng wuld send for her for your maters.

Your elmyse [_enemies_] be as bold her as thei wer befor, wherfor I can
not thynk but that thei have sume comfort. I sent to Cayster that thei
shuld be war in kepyng of the place, as ye dede wright to me. Hast you
to spede your maters as spedily ye can, that ye may have lesse felesshep
at Cayster, for the expences and costs be grete, and ye have no nede
therof and [_if_] ye remembre you wele what charges ye have beside, and
how your liffelode is dispoyled and wasted by your adversaries.

Also I wuld ye shuld purvey for your suster[15-3] to be with my Lady of
Oxford,[16-1] or with my Lady of Bedford,[16-2] or in sume other
wurchepfull place, wher as ye thynk best, and I wull help to her
fyndyng, for we be eyther of us werye of other. I shall tell you more
whan I speke with you. I pray you do your devyr her in as ye wull my
comfort and welefar, and your wurchep, for diverse causes which ye shall
understand afterward, &c.

I spake with the Lord Skales at Norwich, and thanked hym for the good
lordshep that he had shewed to you, and desired his Lordship to be your
contynuall good lord; and he swore be his trought he wold do that he
myght do for you; and he told me that Yelverton the Justice had spoke to
hym in your maters, but he told me not what; but I trow, and ye desired
hym to telle you, he wuld. Ye ar be holdyng to my Lord of his good
report of you in this contre, for he reported better of you than I trow
ye deserve. I felt be hym that ther hath be profered hym large proferes
on your adversaries parte ageyn you.

Send me word as hastly as ye may after the begynnyng of the terme, how
ye have sped in all your maters, for I shall thynk right long till I her
sume good tidyngs.

Item, I pray you recomaund me to the good mayster[16-3] that ye gaffe to
the chapell of Cayster, and thank hym for the gret cost that he dede on
me at Norwych; and if I wer a grette lady he shuld understand that he
shuld far the better for me, for me semyth be his demenyng he shuld be
right a good man.

Item, I send you the nowche[16-4] with the dyamaunch, be the berer
herof. I pray yow forgate not to send me a kersche[16-5] of Cr'melle for
nekkerchys for your syster Anne, for I am schente of the good lady that
sche is with, be cawse she hathe non, and I can non gette in all thys
towne.

I xuld wrythe mor to yow but for lakke of leyser. God have yow in Hys
kepyng, and send yow good spede in alle your maters. Wryten in haste on
Eestern Munday.

  Be your Moder.

    kinswoman, Anne Haute, Lord Scales appears at this time to have
    interested himself in Sir John's behalf. On the back of this

JOHN PASTON TO SIR JOHN PASTON[21-1]

[Sidenote: 1469 / [MAY]]

Syr, plesyth it to undyrstand, that I conceyve, by your lettyr whyche
that ye sent me by Jwde, that ye have herd of R. C.[21-2] labor whyche
he makyth by our ungracyous sustyrs[21-3] assent; but wher as they wryet
that they have my good wyll ther in, savyng your reverence, they falsly
lye of it, for they never spake to me of that mater, ner non othyr body
in ther name. Lovell axyd me onys a qwestyon whedyr that I undyrstood
how it was betwyx R. C. and my suster. I can thynk that it was by Callys
menys, for when I axyd hym whedyr C. desyird hym to meve me that
qwestyon or not, he wold have gotyn it aweye by humys and by hays, but I
wold not so be answeryd; wherfor at the lest he told me that hys oldest
sone desyird hym to spere [_inquire_] whedyr that R. C. wes swyr of hyr
or nowt, for he seyd that he knew a good maryage for hyr, but I wot he
lyeyd, for he is hole with R. Cale in that mater. Wherfor to the entent
that he nor they sholl pyck no comfort of me, I answerd hym, that and my
fadyr, whom God asoyle, wer a lyve, and had consentyd ther to, and my
modyr, and ye bothe, he shold never have my good wyll for to make my
sustyr to selle kandyll and mustard in Framlyngham; and thus, wythe mor
whyche wer to longe to wryet to you, we departyd.

And wher as it plesythe you in your lettyr to crye me mercy for that ye
sent me not syche ger as I sent yow mony for, I crye yow mercy that I
was so lewde [_bold_] to encomber yow with eny so sympyll a mater,
consyderyng the grette maters and weyghty that ye have to doo; but need
compellyd me, for in thys contre is no syche stuffe as I sent to yow
for.

Also, wher as it plesyth yow to send to Rychard Calle to delyver me
monye, so God help me, I wyll non axe hym for my sylfe, nor non had I of
hym, nor of non othyr man but of myne owne, syne ye depertyd; but that
lytyll that I myght forbere of myne owne, I have delyveryd to Dawbeney
for howsold, and pay it for yow in menys wagys; and ther for who ever
sendys yow word that I have spent yow eny mony syne ye went hens, they
must geve yow an othyr reknyng, savyng in met and drynk, for I eete lyek
an horse, of purpose to eete yow owte at the dorys. But that nedythe
not, for ye com not within them; wherfor, so God help me, the felaushep
her thynkys that ye have forgetyn us alle. Wherfor and eny thyng be ille
rewlyd when ye come home, wyet it [_impute it to_] your selfe for defawt
of oversyght.

Also, I undyrstand for verry se[r]teyn, and it is sent me so woord owt
of my Lordys howse, that thys Pentcost is my Lordys consell at
Framlyngham, and they purpose thys week and the next to hold coortys her
at Caster, and at all othyr maners that wer Sir John F.,[22-1] and
purchasyd of Yelverton and of Syr T. H.,[22-2] whom God asoyle, and how
that my demenyng sholbe, it is to late to send to yow for avyse;
wherfor, and I do well I axe no thank, and if I do ille, I pray yow
leythe the defawt on over lytyll wyte, but I purpose to use the fyrst
poynt of hawkyng, to hold fast and I maye; but so God help me, and they
myght pulle downe the howse on our hedys, I wyet [_blame_] hem not,
whyche I trust to God to help hem from; for by God that bowght me, the
best Erle in Inglond wold not dele so with my Lord and my Lady as ye do,
withowt makyng of some menys to them; so God help me, whoso ever avyse
yow to do so, he is not your frend. And I may, I trust to God to se yow
abowght Mydsomer or befor, for in good feythe I wene ye purpose yow that
it shall be Estern er ye come hom, for all your servants her wen [_here
ween_] that ye purpose ne more to dele with them, but to leve hem her
[_here_] in ostage to my Lord of Norfolk.

Also, syr, I pray yow purvey what Ine that my brodyr Edmund shall be in,
for he losythe sore hys tyme her, I promyse yow; I pray yow send me word
by the next messenger that comyth, and I shall eythyr send hym or bryng
hym up with me to London.

Also, syr, we pore _sanz deners_ of Castr have brook iij. or iiij.
stelle bowys; wherfor we beseche yow, and ther be eny maker of steele
bowys in London whyche is very kunnyng, that ye wyll send me woord, and
I shall send yow the bowys that be broken, whyche be your owne greet
bowe, and Roberd Jacksonys bowe, and Johon Pampyngs bowe; thes iij. have
kast so many calvys, that they shall never cast qwarellys[23-1] tyll
they be new mad.

I praye yow fynd the menys that my Lord have some resonable meane
profyrd, so that he and my Lady may undyrstand that ye desyr to have hys
good lordshep. I promyse yow it shall do yow ease and your tenaunts
bothe, and God preserve.

ABSTRACT[24-3]

RICHARD CALLE TO SIR JOHN PASTON

[Sidenote: 1469 / MAY 22]

I would have been with you on Sunday before Ascension Day, had I
received any command to that effect. Henry Wheler told me my day of the
surety of peace was _quindena Trinitatis_, 'and thereof he made me a
bill. He is foully to blame to serve me so.' I am much bound to you,
nevertheless, for the safeguard of my sureties. Gives an account of
monies disbursed since parting with Sir John at London. Repaid 'my
mistress' 66_s._ 8_d._, part of 100_s._ she lent for Mariot's matter.
Paid Dawbeney for household since Midlent, 30_s._ Received from the
farmer of the dairy, L11, 11_s._ 4_d._ Delivered 'to the master of the
college onward for his hire,' 50_s._ Has received of Paston's 'lifelode'
since he came from London but L18, 10_s._ Has spent L12, 10_s._ more
than he received, and has borrowed of John Wellys and others. Could
borrow nothing of Mr. William. 'And of all this twelvemonth I have not
had one penny for my wages. There is none of them that hath purveyed nor
chevised have so much as I have done. Here is no man paid of their
wages, but all spent in household.' Cannot get a penny in all Suffolk or
Flegge, of Paston's 'lifelode,' nor in Boyton nor Heyneford. Can get
money only at Gughton, which I must gather myself, for the bailiff will
not come there. Much malt made, which had better be sold to pay the
men's wages, who complain grievously, 'and the master of the college and
Sir John Stille both.' Will obtain for Dawbeney in ten days 6 or 7 marks
more, which should keep the household for the next seven or eight weeks.
The price of malt is but 20_d._ a quarter, but it would be better to
sell some than that the men should be unpaid. Wonders he has no word
from him about letting Spoorle. Cannot give Mariot an estate in Bekham
as Paston directs, for Paston has the deed which James Andrewes sealed,
but will talk with him and see how he is disposed; for it would be well
that Paston were through with him. He is not trusty, but seeks pretexts
for delay. Jekson's crossbow is broken. Shall he send it to London to be
mended?

Caster, Monday in Pentecost week.

  [The mention of Jekson's crossbow being broken proves this letter
  to be of the year 1469. Compare No. 710, p. 23.]

RICHARD CALLE TO MARGERY PASTON[25-1]

[Sidenote: 1469]

Myn owne lady and mastres, and be for God very trewe wyff, I with herte
full sorowefull recomaunde me unto you, as he that can not be mery, nor
nought shalbe tyll it be othewise with us then it is yet, for thys lyf
that we lede nough is nowther plesur to Godde nor to the worlde,
consederyng the gret bonde of matrymonye that is made be twix us, and
also the greete love that hath be, and as I truste yet is be twix us,
and as on my parte never gretter; wherfor I beseche Almyghty Godde
comfort us as sone as it plesyth Hym, for we that ought of very ryght to
be moost to gether ar moost asondre; me semyth it is a m^ll.
[_thousand_] yere a goo son that I speke with you. I had lever thenne
all the goode in the worlde I myght be with you. Alas, alas! goode lady,
full litell remembre they what they doo that kepe us thus asunder; iiij.
tymes in the yere ar they a cursid that lette matrymonye; it causith
many men to deme in hem they have large consyence in other maters as
wele as herin. But what lady suffre as ye have do; and make you as mery
as ye can, for I wys, lady, at the longe wey Godde woll of Hys ryght
wysnes helpe Hys servants that meane truly, and wolde leve accordyng to
Hes lawys, &c.

I undrestende, lady, ye have hadde asmoche sorwe for me as any
gentelwoman hath hadde in the worlde, aswolde Godd all that sorwe that
ye have hadde had rested upon me, so that ye hadde be discharged of it,
for I wis, lady, it is to me a deethe to her that ye be entreted other
wise thene ye ought to be. This is a peyneful lyfe that we lede. I can
not leve thus withoute it be a gret displesure to Godde.

Also like you to wete that I had sent you a letter be my ladde from
London, and he tolde me he myght not speeke with you, ther was made so
gret awayte upon hym and upon you boothe. He told me John Threscher come
to hym in your name, and seide that ye sent hym to my ladde for a letter
or a token, weche I shulde have sent you, but he truste hym not; he wold
not delyver hym noon. After that he brought hym a rynge, seyng that ye
sent it hym, comaundyng hym that he schulde delyver the letter or token
to hym, weche I conceyve sethen be my ladde it was not be your sendyng,
it was be my mastres and Sir Jamys[26-1] a vys. Alas, what meane they? I
suppose they deeme we be not ensuryd to gether, and if they so doo I
merveyll, for thene they ar not wele avised, remembryng the pleynes that
I breke to my mastres at the begynnyng, and I suppose be you bothe, and
ye dede as ye ought to do of very ryght; and if ye have do the contrare,
as I have be enformed ye have do, ye dede nouther concyensly nor to the
plesure of Godde, withoute ye dede it for feere, and for the tyme to
please suche as were at that tyme a boute you; and if ye so dede it for
this service it was a resonable cause, consederyng the grete and
importable callyng upon that ye hadde, and many an on trewe tale was
made to you of me, weche God knowt I was never gylty of.

My ladde tolde me that my mastres your modre axyd hym if he hadde
brought any letter to you, and many other thyngs she bare hym on
hande,[27-1] and a monge all other at the last she seide to hym that I
wolde not make her prevy to the begynnyng, but she supposyd I wolde at
the endyng; and as to that, God knowt sche knewe furst of me and non
other. I wott not what her mastreschip meneth, for be my trowthe ther is
no gentylwoman on lyve that my herte tendreth more then it dothe her,
nor is lother to displese, savyng only your person, weche of very ryght
I ought to tendre and love beste, for I am bounde therto be the lawe of
Godde, and so wol do whyle that I leve, what so ever falle of it.
I supose, and ye telle hem sadly the trouthe, they wold not dampne ther
soules for us; though I telle hem the trouthe they woll not be leve me
as weele as they woll do you; and ther for, goode lady, at the reverence
of Godde be pleyne to hem and telle the trouthe, and if they woll in no
wise agree therto, betwix God, the Deelf, and them be it, and that
perell that we schuld be in, I beseche Godde it may lye upon them and
not upon us. I am hevy and sory to remembre ther disposicion, God sende
them grace to gyde all thyngs weele, as wele I wolde they dede; Godde be
ther gide, and sende them peas and reste, &c.

I mervell moche that they schulde take this mater so heedely as I
undrestonde they doo, remembryng it is in suche case as it can not be
remedyed, and my desert upon every be halfe it is for to be thought ther
shulde be non obstacle a yenst it; and also the worchipfull that is in
them, is not in your mariage, it is in ther owne mariage, weche I
beseche Godde sende hem suche as may be to ther worschip and plesur to
Godde, and to ther herts ease, for ell[es] were it gret pety. Mastres,
I am aferde to write to you, for I undrestonde ye have schewyd my
letters that I have sent you be for this tyme; but I prey you lete no
creatur se this letter. As sone as ye have redde it lete it be brent,
for I wolde no man schulde se it in no wise; ye had no wrytyng from me
this ij. yere, nor I wolle not sende you no mor, therfor I remytte all
this matre to your wysdom. Almyghty Jesu preserve, kepe, and [give] you
your hertys desire, weche I wotte weele schulde be to Goods plesur, &c.

Thys letter was wreten with as greete peyne as ever wrote I thynge in my
lyfe, for in goode feyth I have be ryght seke, and yet am not veryly
weele at ease, God amend it, &c.

    [Footnote 25-1: [From Fenn, iv. 350.] This letter was evidently
    written about the same period as No. 710. The original appears to
    have had no address, although Fenn prints one in the right-hand

[Sidenote: 1469 / MAY 22]

Ryght worchipfull brother, I recomaund me onto you, lettyng you to

Wretyn at Wyndysore on Monday after Whytsonday, in hast, &c.

  By your brother,

  JAMES HAWTE.

    [Footnote 28-1: [From Fenn, ii. 16.] The King's visit to Norfolk
    and the creation of Lord Stafford as Earl of Devonshire both fix
    the date of this letter as 1469. The writer seems to be the
    brother of Anne Hawte, to whom Sir John Paston was engaged, and he
    accordingly calls him his brother.]

    [Footnote 28-2: Humphrey Stafford, Lord Stafford of Southwick, was
    created Earl of Devonshire on Sunday, 7th May 1469; so that the
    writer ought to have said, not 'upon Sunday,' but 'upon Sunday
    fortnight.']

SIR JOHN PASTON TO JOHN PASTON[29-1]

[Sidenote: 1469 / JUNE]

Brother, it is so that the Kyng schall come in to Norffolk in hast, and

other tydyngs. Late Sorell be well kept.

  JOHN PASTON, Kt.

    [Footnote 29-1: [From Fenn, ii. 22.] This letter must have been
    written in the beginning of June 1469. Edward IV., as appears by
    the dates of his privy seals, was at Windsor on the 29th May and
    at Norwich on the 19th June in that year. Fenn says he was also in
    Norfolk in the year 1474, but I can find no evidence of the fact.]

JOHN PASTON TO SIR JOHN PASTON[30-1]

[Sidenote: 1469 / JUNE]

To begyn, God yeld yow for my hatys. The Kyng hathe ben in this contre,
and worchepfully receyvyd in to Norwyche, and had ryght good cher and
gret gyftys in thys contre, wherwythe he holdyth hym so well content
that he wyll hastyly be her agayn, and the Qwen allso, with whom, by my
power avyse, ye shall com, if so be that the terme be do by that tym
that she com in to this contre. And as for yowr maters her, so God help
me, I have don as myche as in me was, in laboryng of theym, as well to
my Lord Revers[30-2] as to my Lord Scalys,[30-3] Syr John Wydwyll,[30-4]
Thomas Wyngfeld, and othyr abowt the Kyng. And as for the Lord Revers,
he seyd to myn oncyll William, Fayrfax, and me, that he shold meve the
Kyng to spek to the two Dukys of Norffolk and Suffolk, that they shold
leve of ther tytyls of syche lond as wer Syr John Fastolfs. And if so be
that they wold do nowt at the Kyngs reqwest, and then the Kyng shold
comand theym to do no wasts, nor mak non assawtys nor frayis upon your
tenants nor plasys, tyll syche tym as the lawe hathe determynd with yow
or ayenst yow; this was seyd by hym the sam day in the mornyng that he
depertyd at noon. Whedyr he meved the Kyng with it or nowt I can not
sey, myn oncyll Wyllyam thynkys naye. And the same aftyr none folowyng I
told my Lord Scalys that I had spokyn with my Lord hys fadyr, in lyek
forme as I have rehersyd, and axyd hym whedyr that my Lord hys fadyr had
spokyn to the Kyng or nowt, and he gave me thys answer, that whedyr he
had spokyn to the Kyng or nowt, that the mater shold do well inow.

Thomas Wygfeld told me, and swore on to me, that when Brandon meuvyd the
Kyng, and besowght hym to shew my Lord favour in hys maters ayenst yow,
that the Kyng seyd on to hym ayen, 'Brandon, thow thou can begyll the
Dwk of Norffolk, and bryng hym abow the thombe as thow lyst, I let the
wet thow shalt not do me so; for I undyrstand thy fals delyng well
inow.' And he seyd on to hym, more over, that if my Lord of Norffolk
left not of hys hold of that mater, that Brandon shold repent itt, every
vayn in hys hert, for he told hym that he knew well inow that he myght
reauyll [_rule_] my Lord of Norffolk as he wold; and if my Lord dyd eny
thyng that wer contrary to hys lawys, the Kyng told hym he knew well
inow that it was by no bodys menys but by hys; and thus he depertyd fro
the Kyng.

Item, as by wordys, the Lord Scalys and Syr John Wydwyll tok tendyr your
maters mor then the Lord Revers.

Item, Syr John Wydvyll told me, when he was on horsbak at the Kyngs
depertyng, that the Kyng had comandyd Brandon of purpose to ryd forthe
fro Norwych to Lyne, for to tak a conclusyon in your mater for yow; and
he bad me that I shold cast no dowghtys but that ye shold have your
entent, and so dyd the Lord Scalys also; and when that I preyd them at
eny tyme to shew ther favor to your mater, they answered that it was
ther mater as well as yours, consyderyng, the alyans[31-1] betwyx yow.
Comon with Jakys Hawt, and he shall tell yow what langage was spekyn
betwen the Duk of Suffolks consell, and hym, and me; it is to long to
wryght, but I promyse yow ye ar be held to Jakys, for he sparyd not to
spek.

Item, the Kyng rod thorow Heylysdon Waren towads Walsyngham, and Thomas
Wyngfeld promysyd me that he wold fynd the menys that my Lord of
Glowsestyr[31-2] and hym sylf bothe shold shew the Kyng the loge that
was breke down, and also that they wold tell hym of the brekyng down of
the plase. Contrary to thys maters, and all the comfort that I had of my
Lord Scalys, Sir John Wydvyll, and Thomas Wyngfeld, myn oncyll Wylliam
sethe that the Kyng told hym hys owne mowthe, when he had redyn for by
the loge in Heylysdon Waren, that he supposyd as well that it myght fall
downe by the self as be plukyd downe, for if it had be plukyd down, he
seyd that we myght have put in our byllys of it, wehn hys jugys sat on
the _oyeer determyner_ in Norwyche, he beyng ther. And then myn oncyll
seythe how that he answered the Kyng, that ye trustyd to hys good grace
that he shold set yow thorow with both the Dwkys, by mene of trete; and
he seythe that the Kyng answerd hym that he wold neythyr tret nor spek
for yow, but for to let the lawe proced, and so he seyth that they
depertyd. And by my trowthe, and my Lord Tresorer encorage you not more
than he dyd us her, ye shall have but esy [_indifferent_] help as on
that party. Wherfor labor your maters effectually; for by my trowthe it
is nedy[s], for, for all ther wordys of plesur, I cannot undyrstand what
ther labor in thys contre hathe don good; wherfor be not ovyr swyft tyll
ye be swyr of your lond, but labor sore the lawe, for by my trowthe tyll
that be passyd with yow, ye get but esy help as I can undyrstand.

I had with me on day at dener in my modyrs plase, she beyng owt, the
Lord Scalys, Sir John Wydvyll, Sir John Haward, Nicolas Haward, John of
Par, Thomas Gornet, Foscwe, Cheyny, Trussell, the Knyghts son, Thomas
Boleyn, _qua propter_, Brampton, Barnard, and Broun, Perse, Howse, W.
Tonstale, Lewes Debretayll, and othyr, and mad hem good cher, so as they
held them content.

Item, my Lord of Norffolk gave Bernard, Broom, nor me no gownys at thys
seson, wherfor I awaytyd not on hym; notwithstandyng I ofyrd my servyse
for that seson to my Lady, but it was refusyd, I wot by avyse; wherfor I
purpose no more to do so. As for Bernard, Barney, Broom, and W.
Calthorp, ar sworn my Lord of Glowsetyrs men, but I stand yet at large;
not withstandyng my Lord Scalys spok to me to be with the Kyng, but I
mad no promes so to be, for I told hym that I was not woorthe a groote
withowt yow, and therfor I wold mak no promes to nobody tyll they had
your good wyll fyrst; and so we depertyd.

It was told me that ther was owt a preve seall for yow to attend upon
the Kyng northeward; and if it be so, I thynk veryly it is do to have
yow fro London be craft, that ye shold not labor your maters to a
conclusyon thys terme, but put them [in] delaye. I pray yow purvey yow
on it to be at hom as sone as the terme is doone, for be God I take gret
hurt for myn absence in dyvers plasys, and the most part of your men at
Caster wyll deperte withowt abod, and ye be not at hom within thys
fortnyght. I pray yow bryng hom poynts and lasys of sylk for yow and me.

ABSTRACT[33-1]

RICHARD CALLE TO SIR JOHN PASTON

[Sidenote: 1469 / JULY 3]

Has arranged with Mariot's debtors at Bekham, and discharged him of the
debt of L16. Has thus taken an open estate in the manor, as Paston
desired. Had much trouble to bring Mariot, and especially his wife, [to
reason], but with fair words and money got her out of the house. Lord
Scales has sent to-day to Mr. Roos and others for men to come to
Middleton on Wednesday,--short warning enough; and we were in doubt
'what purveyance ye had made at London.' I believe my mistress and my
master your brother have sent you word of the demeaning of the King and
the Lords here.

Norwich, Monday after St. Peter's day.

  [The reference to the King's being in Norfolk fixes the date of this
  letter to the year 1469.]

    [Footnote 35-1: [From Fenn, ii. 40.] The dates of Edward the
    Fourth's privy seals show that he was at Nottingham in July 1469.
    He was not there in 1470, the year to which Fenn assigns these
    letters; and both Clarence and Warwick were then in France. It
    would appear, therefore, that these letters were written at the
    time of Robin of Redesdale's rebellion, which the King was going

[Sidenote: 1469 / AUG. 31]

I grete you wele, and send you Godds blyssyng and myn, letyng you wete
that Sir John Hevenyngham was at Norwich this day, and spake with me at
my moders, but he wuld not that it shuld be understand, for my Lord hath
mad hym on of the capteynes at Caystre of the pepill that shuld kepe the
wetche abaught the place, that no mann shuld socour them, if my Lord
departed. I desired hym to favour them, if any man shuld come to them
fro me or you, and he wuld not graunte it, but he desired me to write to
you to understand if that my Lord myght be mevyd to fynde suerte to
recompense you all wrongs, and ye wuld suffre hym to entre pesibilly,
and the lawe after his entre wuld deme it you. Be ye avysed what answer
ye wuld yeve.

Item, sith that that I spake with hym, and the same day a feythfull
frende of owrs came on to me and mevyd me if that my Lord myght be
entreted to suffre endifferent men to kepe the place, and take the
profites for bothe parties till the right be determyned be the lawe; and
my Lord for his parte, and ye for your parte, to fynde sufficient suerte
that you nowther shuld vex, lette, ner trobilled the seid endifferent
men to kepe pesibiley the possession of the seid place, and to take the
profights on to the tyme to be determyned be the lawe, to his behowe
that the lawe demeth it. And the seid persones that so endifferently
kepe possession befor ther entre into the seid place, to fynde also
sufficient suerte to answer the parte that the lawe demeth it to, of the
profits duryng ther possession, and to suffre hym pessibilly to entre,
or any in his name, whan so ever thei be required be the parte to whom
the right is demyd of all thes premyses. Send werd how ye will be
demened be as good advyse as ye can gete, and make no longer delay, for
thei must neds have hasty socour that be in the place, for thei be sore
hurt, and have non help. And if thei have hasty help it shall be the
grettest wurchip that ever ye had, and if thei be not holpen it shall be
to you a gret diswurchep; and loke never to have favour of your neybors
and frends but if this spede wele; therfor pretend it in your mend, and
purvey therfor in hast. How so ever ye do, God kepe you, and send yow
the vittory of your elmyse, and geve yow and us al grace to leve in
peas. Wretyn on Sent Gyles Evyn,[37-1] at ix. of the belle at nyght.

Robyn came home yester evyn, and he brought me nowther writyng from you,

sent you so many messangers, and have so febill answers ageyn.

MARGARET PASTON TO SIR JOHN PASTON[37-2]

[Sidenote: 1469]

I grete zow wel, and send zow Godds blyssyng and myn, letyng zow wete
that on Thurysday last was my moder and I wer with my Lord of
Norwych,[37-3] and desyerd hym that he woold no mor do in the mater
towscheyng zowr syster, tyl that ze and my brother and other that wern
executors to zowr fader mythe beyn her to geder, for they had the rule
of her as weel as I; and he sayde playnly that he had be requeryd so
oftyn for to exameyn her, that he mythe not nor woold no longar delay
yt, and schargyd me, in peyn of cursyng, that sche schuld not be
deferred, but that she xuld a per beforn hym the nexte day; and I sayd
pleynly that I woold nowder bryng her nor send her; and than he sayd
that he woold send for her hym sylfe, and schargyd that she schuld be at
her lyberte to cume wan he sent for her; and he seyd be hys trowthe that
he woold be as sory for her and [_if_] sche ded not welle, as he wold be
and sche wer ryth ner of hys kyn, bothe for my moder ys sake and myn,
and other of her frendds, for he woost welle that her demenyng had
stekyd soor at our harts.

My moder and I in formyd hym that we kowd never onderstond be her
sayyng, be no language that ever sche had to hym, that neyther of hem
wer bownd to other, but that they myth schese bothe. Than he seyd that
he woold sey to her as wele as he kowde, before that he exameynd her;
and so that was told me be dyverse persones that he ded as welle and as
pleynly as sche had be rythe ner to hym, wych wer to long to wrythe at
thys tyme: her aftyr ye xalle wete, and hoo wer laberers ther in. The
schanseler[38-1] was not so gylty her in as I wend he had ben.

On Fryday the Bysschope he sent for her be Asschefeld and other that arn
ryth sory of her demenyng. And the Bysschop seyd to her ryth pleynly,
and put her in rememberawns how she was born, wat kyn and frendds that
sche had, and xuld have mo yf sche wer rulyd and gydyd aftyr hem; and yf
she ded not, wat rebuke, and schame, and los yt xuld be to her, yf sche
wer not gydyd be them, and cause of forsakyng of her for any good, or
helpe, or kownfort that sche xuld have of hem; and seyd that he had hard
sey, that sche loved schecheon [_such one_] that her frend[es] wer not
plesyd with that sche xuld have, and therfor he had her be ryth weel
avysyd how sche ded, and seyd that he woold undyrstand the woords that
sche had seyd to hym, wheyther that mad matrimony or not. And sche
rehersyd wat sche had seyd, and seyd, yf thoo wordds mad yt not suher,
she seyd boldly that sche wold make that suerher or than sche went
thens, for sche seyd sche thowgthe in her conschens sche was bownd, wat
so ever the wordds wern. Thes leud wordds greveth me and her grandam as
myche as alle the remnawnte. And than the Bysschop and the Schawnseler
bothe seyd that ther was neyther I ner no frend of hers wold reseyve
[her].

And than Calle was exameynd aparte be hym sylfe, that her wordds and hys
acordyd, and the tyme, and wher yt xuld a be don. And than the Bysschop
sayd that he supposyd that ther xuld be fownd other thynggs ageyns hym
that mythe cause the lettyng ther of; and ther for he say he wold not be
to hasty to geve sentens ther upon, and sayd that he wold geve overe day
tyl the Wednsday or Thursday aftyr Mykylmes, and so yt tys delayyd. They
woold an had her wyl performyd in haste, but the Bysschope seyd he woold
non other wyse than he had seyd.

I was with my moder at her plase whan sche was exameynd, and wan I hard
sey what her demenyng was, I schargyd my servaunts that sche xuld not be
reseyved in my hows. I had zeve hir warnyng, sche mythe a be war a for,
yf sche had a be grasyows; and I sent to on or ij. mor that they xuld
not reseyve her yf sche cam; sche was browthe a geyn to my place for to
a be reseyved, and Sir Jamys[39-1] tolde them that browthe her that I
had schargyd hem alle and sche xuld not be reseyved; and soo my Lord of
Norwych hath set her at Roger Bests, to be ther tyle the day befor sayd,
God knowyth fule evel ageyn hys wyle and hys wyvys, yf they durst do
other wyse. I am sory that they arn a cumyrd with her, but zet I am
better payed that sche isther for the whyle, that sche had ben in other
place be cause of the sadnes and good dysposysion of hys sylfe and hys
wyfe, for sche xal not be sou'd [_suffered ?_] ther to pleye the
brethele.[39-2] I pray zow and requer zow that ye take yt not pensyly,
for I wot wele yt gothe ryth ner zowr hart, and so doth yt to myn and to
other; but remembyr zow, and so do I, that we have lost of her but a
brethele,[39-2] and set yt the les to hart, for and sche had be good,
wherso ever sche had be, yt xuld not aben as it is, for and he wer ded
at thys owyr, she xuld never be at myn hart as sche was. As for the
devors [_divorce_] that ze write to me of, I supose wat ze ment, but I
scharge zow upon my blyssyng that ze do not, ner cause non other to do,
that xuld offend God and zour conschens, for and ze do, or cause for to
be do, God wul take vengawns ther upon, [and] ye xuld put zour sylfe and
other in gret joparte; for wettyt wele, sche xal ful sor repent her
leudnes her aftyr, and I pray God sche mute soo. I pray zow for myn hard
ys hese [_heart's ease_], be ze of a good cownfort in alle thynggs;
I trust God xal helpe ryth wele, and I pray God so do in alle our
maters. I wuld ze toke hed yf ther weher any labor mad in the kort of
Cawntrybery for the leud mater forsayd.

But yf [_i.e._ unless] the Duke[40-1] be purveyd for, he and hys wyse
kow[n]sel xalle lefe thys cuntre; yt is told me that he seythe that he
wul not spar to do that he is purposyd, for no Duke in Ynglond. God
helpe at nede.

SIR JOHN PASTON TO MASTER WRITTILL[41-1]

[Sidenote: 1469 / SEPT. 10]

Ryght wershypfull syr, I recomaund me to you, thankyng you of your grete
labour whych I have nozt as yet, but I shall deserve to my power; and
ferthermore lyke yow to wyte that I have thoght ryght long after you;
nevyrthelesse I remember well that ye delt wythe ryght delayous peple.
My Lord Archbyshop and other of my Lords, and I, dempte by cawse of your
long tarryng, that by youre sad dyscrescyon all hadde ben sett thorow.
Neverthelesse I understend by your wrytyng that my Lord of Norffolks
concell thynketh that hys entent, whych ye sertefyed me by your wrytyng,
sholde be more to hys wyrshep than the appoyntements and rewll made by
the Lords of the Kyngs concell whych be to my seyd Lord of Norffolk ner
kyne [_near kin_]; whych appoyntements sythen yourr departyng hath be
largely remembryd amongs the seyd Lords here, thynkyng it in hem self so
honorabyll to my Lord of Norffolk, that ther shuld non of my Lords
concell well avysed mevyd to the contrary.

Jamys Hobard[42-1] was sent fro my [Lord] of Norffolk heder, and spake
with my Lord Archbyshop,[42-2] and answer he had of my seyd Lord; and
howe my Lord tendryd the mater yet and wyll I trowe he have told you,
and yf he have not, the brynger her of schall informe you; and he broght
thys same appoyntement from my Lord, that my Lord was well agryed that I
shulde ocupye. For my parte, iff I shud take no other apoyntement but
acordyng to your letter, it wer hard for me and for my tytell to putte
my Lord in that possessyon; for ther ys thyngs in erthe [_uneath_,
_i.e._ scarcely] to myn esse in your letter, gode for me in that
appoyntement, savyng the suerty of my brothers lyffe and my servants,
whych ye thynke dowtefull yf so be that thay lakke stuff, shotte, and
vytayll; mervaylyng sore, and thynk it impossybell in thys shorte
season, or in iiij. tyme the season heder towards, that thay shuld lakk
other [_either_], with owte it soo be that my Lords men have enterd
owght the place, and so had ther stuffe from hem, whych I cannot thynk.
Also, sir, for [_fore_] the tyme of your comyng to my Lord of Norffolk,
servaunts of [my Lords wer with][42-3] my moder at Norwych, mevyng to
send to my brother hyr sone, to delyver the place under such a forme as
youre lettere specefyeth, and so I cannot understand what regard my
Lords concell takyth to my Lords letter, and to your labour in thys
behalf, but that they offeryd as largely afore. Ze wryteth in your
letter that ye durst not passe your credens; please you to remember that
seyd your credens affore the Lords was ryght large, and as large as
myght well be in thys mater, both to my Lords concell of Norffolk to
withdrawe the seege, with moor other mater as ye knowe; and to the
Justice of the Peas and to the Shyryff and hys offycers, your awtoryte
was grete inow to iche of them.

Wherfor, Mayster Wretell, I never for this, nere zet wyll, take
appoyntement in thys mater, but as my Lords wyll and my Lord Archbyshop,
whych, as well as I my self, have holy putte our tryst to youre dyscrete
dyreccyon; and my seyd Lord sythen youre departer, zour zoyng,[43-1]
thynkyng you alls mete a man in executyng ther comaundement as cowde be
chosyn. Neverthelesse for awnswer to you at thys season, my Lord
Archbyshop ys north wards towards the Kyng; how be it, it ys seyd, uppon
a metyng with my Lord of Clarens, my Lord shuld retourne a yen; and as
zester evyn he send a servaunt of hys to me, wenyng to hys Lordship that
Sir Humfray[43-2] and ye wer in Caster as was appoynted, and ye shuld
send to hys Lordshyp answer of the gydyng ther by wrytyng, comaundyng me
that yff any such wrytyngs cam from you, yf hys Lordshyp wer not past
xx. myle fr[om Lond]on,[43-3] to com to hys Lordshyp with the same.
Understandyng for sertayn that he ys nott yet so ferr, wherfor I will in
althe hast possybell ryde nygt and day till I see hys Lordshyp, and
after comunicacyon had with hys Lordshyp, as sone as ys possybell that a
man may go be twext, ye shall have an answer of hys dysposicyon; for hys
intres is such that, as I have wryten, I shall never do therin withoute
hym, as my cosyn, brynger herof, more playnly shall enforme you; for I
canne thynke ryght well, that as ze wryteth to me, my broder wyll not
delyver the place to non erthly person, but yf he see wrytyng fro my
Lord.

It semyt be yowr wrytyng that my Lord of Norffolk conseyll intende not
that my Lord Archbyshop shuld dele in thys mater, for he ys not named in
your letter, wherof I mervayle; for it was movyd to you at your
departyng hens, the Kyngs concell shuld have take dyreccyon in thys
mater, or els my Lord Cardenall,[44-1] my Lord of Clarens, my Lord
Archbyshop, and my Lord of Essex,[44-2] &c. Neverthelesse, Mayster
Wryttyll, all profytht, maner, or lyflod, leyd apart, if it be so that
thorow reklesnese my brother and servaunts be in such joperte as ye have
wryten to me (whych shold be half impossybell in my mynd that thay shold
myssuse so mech stuff in iiij. tymes the space), and that ye have
evident knowlych by my seyd brother hym self therof, I woll praye yow to
se hym and them in suerte of ther lyffys, what so ever shold fall of the
lyfflode; how be it I wold not that my brother and servaunts shold gyff
upp the place not for a m^l_li._, yf thay myght in any wyse kepe it and
save ther lyves. And therfor, at the reverens of God, sycht it ys so,
that my Lord Archbyshop and my Lords all, and I, have putte our trust in
you, that ye wyll do your devoyer to have the verrey knowlech of my
brother hymself, and not of my Lords men, wheder he stante in such
jopertye as your letter specefyeth or net, for I dowte not uppon the
syzth of thys letter, and of the letter that ye had before, that my
brother will put no mystrust in you, consyderyng that he knowyth that ye
com from my Lords, and my Lord Archbyshop, and have my wrytyng; and as
for my Lord Archbyshop wrytyng and aunswere, such as it shalbe, ye shall
have it in all the haste possybell. But I thynke veryly that my Lord
eschewyth to telle you any thyng without that he myght speke with you
allone, and me thynketh veryly that thay ought not to lette [_hinder_]
you to speke with hym allone, consyderyng that ye have auctoryte and
wrytyng from the Lords so to do. And as for the justificacyon of entryng
the place, and sege layng to [the same][44-3] and the comaundement of
the Justice of the Pease and the Sherewe to assyste my Lord in thys
gydyng, I wote ye understond that the Lords knowe all that mater, and ye
herd it comened, and how thay toke it in ther consayts.

Ther ys no more, Mayster Wryttell, but I commyth all thys wrytyng unto
your dyscrescyon; and as ye thynk best acordyng to such menys desyre as
have entretyd you therin, and for my moyst avayle, I pray you, sir, soo
doo, and I shall se un to your besynes and labour, that ye shall have
cause to do for me in tyme comyng, and as the brynger herof shall tell
you. And I pray God have you in Hys kepyng.

Wryten at London, the x. day of Septembr.

MARGARET PASTON TO SIR JOHN PASTON[45-1]

[Sidenote: 1469 / SEPT. 12]

I grete you wele, letyng you wete that your brother and his felesshep
stand in grete joperte at Cayster, and lakke vetayll; and Dawbeney[45-2]
and Berney[45-3] be dedde, and diverse other gretly hurt; and they fayll
gunnepowder and arrowes, and the place sore brokyn with gonnes of the
toder parte, so that, but thei have hasty help, thei be like to lese
bothe ther lyfes and the place, to the grettest rebuke to you that ever
came to any jentilman, for every man in this countre marvaylleth gretly
that ye suffre them to be so longe in so gret joperte with ought help or
other remedy.

The Duke hathe be more fervently set therup on, and more cruell, sith
that Wretyll, my Lord of Claraunce man, was ther, than he was befor, and
he hath sent for all his tenaunts from every place, and other, to be
ther at Cayster at Thorysday next comyng, that ther is than like to be
the grettest multitude of pepill that came ther yet. And thei purpose
them to make a gret assaught--for thei have sent for gannes [_guns_] to
Lynne and other place be the seeys syde--that, with ther gret multitude
of gannes, with other shoot and ordynaunce, ther shall no man dar appere
in the place. Thei shall hold them so besy with ther gret pepill, that
it shall not lye in their pore within to hold it ageyn them with ought
God help them, or have hasty socour from you.

Therfor, as ye wull have my blyssyng, I charge you and require you that
ye se your brother be holpyn in hast. And if ye can have nonmeane,
rather desire writyng fro my Lord of Clarens, if he be at London, or
ell[es] of my Lord Archebusshop of York, to the Duke of Norffolk, that
he wull graunte them that be in the place her lyfes and ther goodes; and
in eschewyng of insurreccions with other in convenyens that be like to
growe within the shire of Norffolk, this trobelows werd [_world_], be
cause of such conventicles and gaderyngs within the seid shire for cause
of the seid place, thei shall suffre hym to entre up on such
appoyntment, or other like takyn be the advyse of your councell ther at
London, if ye thynk this be not good, till the law hath determyned
otherwyse; and lete hym write a nother letter to your brother to deliver
the place up on the same appoyntment. And if ye think, as I can suppose,
that the Duke of Norffolk wull not aggre to this, be cause he graunted
this aforn, and thei in the place wuld not accept it, than I wuld the
seid massanger shuld with the seid letters bryng fro the seid Lord of
Clarence, or ell[es] my Lord Archebusshop, to my Lord of Oxenford, other
letters to rescue them forth with, thowghe the seid Erle of Oxenford
shuld have the place duryng his lyfe for his labour. Spare not this to
be don in hast, if ye wull have ther lyves, and be sett by in Norffolk,
though ye shuld leys the best maner of all for the rescuse. I had lever
ye last the lyffelode than ther lyfes. Ye must gete a massanger of the
Lords or sume other notabill man to bryng ther letters.

Do your devoir now, and lete me send you no mor massangers for this
maters; but send me be the berer her of more certeyn comfort than ye
have do be all other that I have sent be for. In any wyse, lete the
letters that shall come to the Erle of Oxenford comyn with the letters
that shall comyn to the Duke of Norffolk, that if he wull not aggree to
the ton, that ye may have redy your rescuse that it nede no mor to send
therfor. God kepe you.

Wretyn the Tuesday next befor Holy Rood Day, in hast.

  Be your Moder.

SIR JOHN PASTON TO MARGARET PASTON[47-1]

[Sidenote: 1469 / SEPT. 15]

Moodr, uppon Saterday last was, Dawbeney and Bernay wer on lyve and
mery, and I suppose ther com no man owt of the place to yow syn that
tyme that cowde have asserteynyd to yow of ther dethys. And as towchyng
the fyrsenesse of the Duke or of hys peple schewyd syn that tyme that
Wryttel departyd, I trowe it was concludyd that trews and abstynence of
werre scholde be hadd er he departyd, whych shalle dewr tyl Monday next
comyng; and by that tyme I trow that trews shall be takyn tyll that day
vij. nyght aftr, by whych tyme I hope of a goode dyreccion schall be
hadde.

And wher as ye wryght to me that I scholde sewe for letteris from my
Lordys of Clarans and Yorke, they be not her, and if they wrot to hym as
they have don ij. tymes, I trow it wolde nat advayle; and as for to
labor thois letteris and the rescu to gedre, they ben ij. sendry
thyngys, for when the rescu is redy, that the cost ther of is don. For
if I be drevyn therto to rescu it er they com ther that scholde do it,
it shall cost a m^{l}. escuys, and as meche after, whyh wey wer harde
for me to take, whyll that I maye do it otherwise; but as to sey that
they schall be rescuyd if all the lands that I have in Ingelond and
frendys maye do it, they shall, and God be frendly, and that as schertly
as it may goodlely and wele be brout abut. And the grettest defawt
erthly is mony and som frendys and neyborys to helpe; wherfor I beseche
yow to sende me comfort with what money ye coude fynde the menys to get
or chevysche uppon suerte sufficient, er uppon lyflod to be inmorgage er
yit solde, and what peple by lyklyed yowr frendys and myn kowde make
uppon a schort warnyng, and to send me worde in all the hast as it is
needfull. But, moodre, I fele by yowr wryghtyng that ye deme in me I
scholde not do my devyr withowt ye wrot to me som hevye tydyngs; and,
modre, if I had nede to be qwykynyd with a letter in thys nede, I wer of
my selfe to slawe [_too slow_] a felaw; but, moodre, I ensur yow that I
have herde x. tymes werse tydyngs syn the assege by gan than any letter
that ye wrot to me, and somtyme I have herde ryght goode tydyngs both.
But thys I ensure yow that they that be within have no werse reste than
I have, ner castyth mor jupperte; but whethyr I had goode tydyngys er
ill, I take Gode to wittnesse that I have don my devoyr as I wolde be
don for in case lyke, and schall doo tyll ther be an ende of it.

I have sent to the Kynge to Yorke, and to the Lordys, and hope to have
ansswer from them by Wednysday at the ferthest, and after that answer
shall I be rewlyd, and than send yow word, for tyll that tyme kan I take
non dyreccion. And to encomfort yow, dy[s]peyre yow not for lak of
vytayle ner of gonne powder, ner be natt to hevy ner to mery therfor;
for and hevynesse or sorow wolde have be the remedy ther of, I knew
nevyr mater in my lyfe that I kowde have ben so hevy or sory for, and
with Goddys grace it schall be remedyed well inow; for by my trowthe I
hadde lever lose the maner of Caister than the symplest mannys lyfe
therin, if that may be hys saveacion. Wherfor I beseche yow to sende me
worde wat mony and men ye thynke that I am lyke to get in that contre;
for the hasty purchace of mony and men schall be the getyng and rescu of
it, and the sauevacion of most mennys lyfys, if we take that weye.

Also thys daye I porpose to sende to Yorke to the Kyng for a thyng,
whych same only maye by lyklyod be the savacion of all. Ye must remembre
that the rescue of it is the last remedy of all, and how it is nat easy
to get; and also ye sende me worde that I scholde nat kome hom withowt
that I kome stronke. But if I had hadd on other stronge place in
Norfolke to have comen to, thowe I have browt ryght fewe with me,
I scholde, with Godds grace, have rescued it by thys tyme, er ellys he
scholde have ben fayne to have besegyd bothe placys or yit, and the Duke
had not kept Yarmoth owthe. But, mother, I beseche yow sende me som
mony, for by my trowth I have but x_s._ I[49-1] wot not wher to have
mor, and moreovyr I have ben x. tymes in lyke case or werse within thys
x. wekys. I sent to Rychard Call for mony, but he sendyth me non.

I beseche yow to gyde the evydence that Pekok can tell yow of, and to se
it saffe; for it is tolde me that Richard Call hath hadd right large
langage of them. I wolde nat they com in hys fyngrys. I have no worde
from yow of them, ner whether ye have yit in yowr kepyng the evydence of
Est Bekham owt of hys handys, ner whethyr ye have sent to my manerys
that they schold not paye hym no mor mony or not. Also that it like yow
to geve credence to Robyn in other thyngs.

Wret the Fryday next after Holy Roode Day.

[Sidenote: 1469 / [SEPT.]]

Hit is so that accordyng to such direccion as was mevid to be desird of
my Lords beyng heer, as for such as heere bee they marveil gretly
therof, thynkyng and remembring in themself that such offre as was made
by my credence to my Lorde,[50-6] and to fore you reported, shuld have
sownyd more to his pleasure and honour than this his desire.
Nevirthelesse my Lords thenke where as they wrote and desirid joyntly
that such credence as ye remembre myght be observyd and taken, and by
you refusid, nowe yif they shuld assent to the desire of this direccion,
hit is thought in them not so to doo; for it is so fortuned that dyvers
of my Lords, from whome I brought both wrytyng and credence, be at the
Kyngs high commaundement hastely departed unto his Highnesse, trustyng
in God to have heeryng in brief tyme of their hasty ayen comyng, atte
which tyme my Lords that heere be, and they that shal come ayen, shal
comon and speke to gyder of this desire and direccion, and such answere
as they geve and make shall be sent unto you than with haste possible.
Ovir this, me thenkith for your excuse of burden and charge such as I
hier will be leid unto you concernyng the grete werks that dailly be and

Cristyn blode and the destruccion of the Kyngs liege people, that at
your politik labour and wisedome ye myght bryng my Lord to th'abstynence
of warre, and a trieux to be had and contynued unto tyme of the retourn
of my seid Lords, or els knowlege of their entent; certifieng you for
trouth that ther be messengers sent unto my seid Lords with lettrez of
such answere as I had of you to your desire to gyder, knowyng certeinly
that ther shal be hasty relacion of ther entents in the premisis, which
answers ye shall have atte ferthist by Monday cometh sevenyght.
Ferthirmore lettyng you wit that I understond for certein that my Lords
that be heere eschewe, for such inconveniense that myght fall, to
conclude any answere by them self, consideryng that my credence was
geven by all the Lords; prayng you, as shal be doon to the continuaunce
of this trieux aforesaid, that I may be acerteyned, or yif at this houre
ye coude yit thenk my credence resonable and honourable to be accepted
and taken, sendith me woorde in wrytyng from you by my servant, brynger
of this, al delaies leid aparte. For I acertein you, as he that owe you
service, I was and yit am gretly blamed for my long tarying with you,
for, dyvers of my Lords taried heere for me, by th'assent of al my
Lords, lenger than they wold have don, to know myn answere and guydyng
from you.

And ovir this I certyfie you that ye cannot make my Lords heere to thenk
that yif ther be inconvenient or myshief, murdre, or manslauter had or
done, but and your wills and entents were to the contrarye, my Lord is
notid so well disposid that, with oute your grete abettement, he neither
will doo nor assent to non such thyng; prayng you therfor, as your
frende, to remembre wele your self, and so to rule you, as my Lords may
have in tyme to come knowlege of your more sadd disposicion than as yit
I feele they thenk in you. And how that my Lords note sum of you, James
Hobert, beyng of my Lords counsel, can enforme you; wherefor for Godds
sake remembr you, and delyver my servant, and yif ye thenk my first
credence or this advertisement shal be taken to effect, than I pray you
that my servaunt, brynger hereof, may have sure condyte to speke with
John Paston, and to report to hym these direccions, and upon that to
delyver hym a bill certifyng the same.

Remembyr zow, ze have had ij. gret lossys withyne thys towylemonth, of

Item, as for mony, I kowde getee but x_li._ upon pledges, and that is

As for the zeddyng [_yielding_] of the place at Caster, I trowe Wretyll

of thys sege that wyll axe yow a peny.

Also I pray yow send downe acomandment to Stutvylle, or to some awdyter,

Richard Calle says he has delivered to me all writings he had of you
except an endenture for letting Saxthorp, which is but a jape. All but a
rental of Snaylwell are but accounts, etc. He has delivered me four or
five court rolls of Sir J. Fastolff's lands, of his own hand. He has
done reasonably well about showing me the arrears of your lifelode. 'As
for his abiding, it is in Blakborow nunnery, a little fro Lynn, and our
unhappy sister's also. And as for his service, there shall have no man
have it before you, and ye will. I hear not speak of none other service,
of no lord's that he shall be in.' Has not yet spoken with Daubney's
executors, but will on his way homewards. Sends copy of the
inventory[63-2] he [John Paston] made on leaving Caister. Means to be at
Sporle to-morrow or Thursday, to see what may be made of the wood, and
who will give most for it.  .  .  .  .  (_MS. mutilated at the bottom._)

WILLIAM WORCESTER TO ----

[Sidenote: 1470]

Letter in English, on paper (signed W. W., but unaddressed), desiring
some one to propose to 'my Lord' [the Bishop of Winchester?] the
obtaining of a letter from Sir John Paston to the tenants of Titchwell
that he will not claim any rents from them, and another from 'my Lord,'
to the same effect, on behalf of Sir William Yelverton; and the sending
a warrant to expend 4 or 6 marks upon making up the sea banks before the
Titchwell pastures, because at Spring the sea breaks in upon them.
Desires to know whether Sir W. Yelverton's advice shall be taken upon
business matters. 'Frere' Geffrey Westvale is going to be created Doctor
in Theology at Cambridge, at the Feast of St. John, who twenty years
past, when at Yarmouth convent, belonged to 'my Maister Fastolf'; and
Sir Thomas Howys, a month before his decease, promised to help him on
Mr. Fastolf's order. He would have come now to 'my Lord' to ask his alms
had not the writer letted him. Desires to be informed whether 'my Lord'
will help him. 'Maister Briston yn lykewyse Maister Spicer, and Maister
Stevyns, trustyn appon me and dyvers others to speke to my Lord for a
relyeve,' and Thomas Fastolf and Milcent Fastolf, and many others, 'that
make me noyed and werye.'

    [Footnote 71-2: [From MS. Titchwell, 120, in Magdalen College,
    Oxford.] From internal evidence it would seem that this letter
    must have been written shortly before that which follows it. The

Letter in English from W. Wyrcestre to Bishop Wayneflete.--Has been at
Tychewell to endeavour to let the manor and farm, but none of the
farmers there will take it without guarantees from Sir John Paston and
Sir William Yelverton in writing against any distraint.  .  .  .  .  the
younger, who owes L9, will come to the Bishop about the letting. The
writer represents his own poor condition. Has been at charges ten years
in London, and in riding on the infinite process of 'my Maister
Fastolf's testament yn the court of audience.' Is now obliged to retire
from London to Cambridge in order to live cheaply. Had been promised 25
marks on Paston's behalf, 20 marks for ever of Fastolf's lands, 5 marks
of fee for his life, and L15 worth of land for ever. Has not had clearly
8 marks.

_To Syr John Paston, Knyght, or to Thomas Stompys, to delyver to the

[Sidenote: 1470 / JUNE 22]

Ryght worchepfull syr, and my specyall good brodyr, I recomand me to
yow; and for as myche as I can not send yow good tydyngs, ye shall have
syche as I knowe.

It is so that on Wednysday last past ye and I, Pampyng, and Edmund Broom
were endyttyd of felonye at the Sessyons her in Norwyche for shotyng of
a gonne at Caster in August last past, whyche goone slowghe two men, I,
Pampyng and Broom as pryncypall, and ye as accessary; notwithstandyng
Townysend[73-1] and Lomner held an oppynyon that the verdytt is voyd,
for ther wer ij. of th'enqwest that wold not agre to th'endyttment. And
in as myche as they ij. wer agreyd in othyr maters, and not in that, and
that they two wer not dyschargyd fro the remnant at syche tym as that
verdyth of yowyr endytment was govyn, ther oppynyon is that all the
vordyght is voyde, as well of all othyr maters as of yowyr. Whedyr ther
opynyon be good or not, I can not determyne, nor them sylf neythyr.

I pray yow let not thys mater be slept, for I can thynk that my Lord of
Norff. consaylle wyll cawse the wedows to tak an apell, and to remeve it
up in to the Kyngs Benche at the begynyng of this term. Townysend hathe
promysyd me that he shall be at London on Twysday next comyng, and then
ye may comon with hym in that mater, and take hys avyse.

Item, Townysend and Lomner thynk that and ye have good consayll, ye may
justyfye the kepyng of the plase for the pesybyll possessyon that ye
have had in it mor then iij. yeer; but in conclusyon, all thys is doo
for nowght ellys but for to enforse yow to take a dyreccyon with my Lord
of Norff.

I undyrstood by R. Sothewell--for he and I comonyd in thys mater ryght
largely betwyx hem and me--in so myche he tellyth me that and I be at
London in the wek next aftyr Seynt Petyr, at whych tyme he shall be ther
hym sylf, he seyth that my Lady hathe promysyd me hyr good ladyshep, and
sent me woord by hym, in as myche as he spak for me to hyr, that she
wold remembyr myn old servyse, and for get the gret dysplesyr in syche
wyse that I shall undyrstand that the swtte that I have mad to my Lord
hyr husbond and hyr shall torne to your avantage and myn, more then we
weene as yett or shall undyrstand tyll syche tyme as I have spokyn with
hyr good grace. And upon thys promesse I have promysyd Sothewell to meet
with hym at London that same weeke next aftyr Seynt Petyr; wherfor I
wold passyngly fayne that ye wer in London at that season, or nye
abowght London, so that I myght undyrstand at your plase wher that I
myght spek with yow or then I spek with my Lady.

I propose to go to Canterbery[74-1] on foot thys next week, with Godds
grace, and so to com to London fro thense. I pray yow se that I be safe
for Parker and Henry Coletts mater.

Sothewell[74-2] told me thys, that if so be that ye wyll your sylf, ye
shall have bothe goode lordshep and ladyshep, and mony or lond, or both,
and all your maters set cler. What that he menyth, I can not sey. As for
all othyr maters in thys contre, I shall do as well as I may for fawt of
monye tyll I spek with yow. I have many collars on, as I shall tell yow
when I come.

No more, but God preserve yow and yours. Wretyn at Norwyche, Fryday next
aftyr Corpus Christi Daye.

I ded as myche as I kowd to have lettyd th'endyttment, but it wold not
be, as I shall enform you; and Townysend knowyth the same.

    [Footnote 72-2: [From Fenn, iv. 428.] As this letter refers to an
    incident in the siege of Caister as having taken place 'in August

    Fenn from an original in the library of Brigg Price Fountaine,
    Esq. of Narford, in Norfolk, nephew and heir of the celebrated
    antiquary, Sir Andrew Fountaine. The MS. was contained in a
    volume of State Papers, some of them originals, and some copies,
    of various dates, which had belonged to Sir Edward Coke.

    the Earl of Warwick, aided by the King of France.]

I myght have sold it her for iij_s._ an unce, sum xx_li._ iiij_s._
iij_d._ Be ware how that ye spend it, but in acquityng you ageyn such as

at this tyme it compellith me to breke up howshold and to sogeorn; which
I am right loth to have to do if I myght otherwyse have chosyn; for it
caused gret clamour in this town[87-1] that I shall do so; and it shuld
not have neded if I had restreyned whan I myght. Therfore for Goddis
sake take hede here to, and be ware from hens forth; for I have
delivered and sent you bothyn my parte the dedis and yowris, and not
restreyned nowthere for my self nor the dede. Where fore I thynk we

to takyn Mautby in myn owyn hand, and to set up husbandry ther; and how
it shall profite me God knowyth. The fermour owyth me lxxx_li._ and

your expenses for any help ye trust to have of me. For I will fro hens
forth bryng my self ought of such daunger as I stand in for your sakes,

    grandson of the Judge, in 1474 (Itin. W. Wyrc. 369), and the match
    had been already determined (as will appear in a future letter)
    before June 1472. At the date of this letter she was still staying
    in Calthorpe's household, into which, after the manner of the
    times, she had been sent for her education; and Calthorpe desiring
    to reduce his establishment, suggested, somewhat earlier than her
    mother anticipated, that it was time to provide a husband for

    [Footnote 98-1: This is another entry from the old index of deeds
    in Magdalen College, Oxford. There is probably some slight error
    in the date, as Edward IV. was not acknowledged as King on the
    10th April, in what would otherwise have been the eleventh year of
    his reign. He was so acknowledged a few days later--_i.e._ after
    the battle of Barnet, which was fought on the 14th April--so that
    if the date had been, say, April 20, instead of April 10, it would
    have been quite consistent. It is impossible, however, to say
    where the error lies, so we place the document under the date
    actually expressed in it.]

As for other tythynges, is undrestande her that the Qwyen Margrett is

JOHN PASTON TO MARGARET PASTON[106-1]

[Sidenote: 1471 / JULY 5]

Most worchepfull and my ryght specyall good modyr, as humbylly as I can,
I recomand me on to yow, besechyng yow of your blyssyng. Please it yow
to undyrstand that thys day I spake with Batcheler Water, whiche let me
have undyrstandyng of your welfare, wherof I thank God with all my hert.
Also he leet me have knowlage that the Lord Scalys had grauntyd yow to
be my good lord, wherof I am no thyng prowd, for he may do leest with
the gret mastyr; but he wold depert ovyr the see, as hastyly as he may;
and because he wenyth that I wold go with hym, as I had promyseyd evyr,
and he had kept foorthe hys jornay at that tyme, thys is the cause that
he wyll be my good lord and help to get my pardon. The Kyng is not best
pleasyd with hym for that he desyerthe to depert, in so myche that the
Kyng hathe seyd of hym, that wen evyr he hathe most to do, then the Lord
Scalys wyll sonest axe leve to depert, and weenyth that it is most be
cause of kowardyese. As for pardon, I can never get, withowght I schold
paye to myche money for it, and I am not so purveyd. As for Herry
Hallman, my brodyr wyll axe hym no sylver tyll ye be payeyd; therfor ye
may send to hym and have it.

Item, I am sory that ye have fadyrd my hors that was at Caster to be my
Brodyr Edmundys, for I had leveer that they had hym style then owght
ellys; wherfor thow they profyr hym yow from hense foorthe, let not my
brodyr Edmund take hym, but let him sey whedyr they wyll let hym have
hym or not, that I have promyseyd my brodyr Edmund a bettyr hors for
hym, so that he wyll not cleyme the same for hys. As for tydyngs her be
non but that the Scottys and Walyshe men be besy; what they meane I can
not seye. My cosyn John Loveday can tell yow, and ther be eny odyr
flyeyng talys, for he hathe walkyd in London, and so do not I. When I
may I wyll come hom with Godys grace, whom I beseche to sende you your
hertys desyeyr. Wretyn the v. daye of Julle.

  Be yowr humblest sone and servant,

  J. P.

    [Footnote 106-1: [From Fenn, iv. 116.] From the mention of Lord
    Scales in this letter it might be supposed that it was written not
    later than the year 1469, when Anthony Woodville, the last Lord
    Scales, became Earl Rivers by the death of his father; but I
    believe the date to be 1471, and that the writer is simply
    speaking of Earl Rivers by his old title. In the first place there
    is no appearance of either of the John Pastons requiring a royal
    pardon before the year 1471; secondly, it is not probable that
    either of them would have spoken so slightingly of the value of
    Lord Scales's intercession at an earlier period; and thirdly, it
    seems doubtful whether Edmund Paston could have been old enough to
    own a war-horse many years before. Finally, we find by Letter 780
    following that John Paston, the youngest, succeeded in obtaining a
    pardon signed by the King on the 17th July 1471. If the reference
    to the autograph plate in Fenn is correct, this letter was in the
    hand of his elder brother, Sir John Paston, Knight; but as it is
    not signed, like most of his letters, 'John Paston, K.,' we are
    inclined to suspect that it was really written by the younger
    brother, like No. 780.]

[Sidenote: 1471 / SEPT. 15]

Ryght well belovyd brother, I comende me to yow, letyng yow wete that I
am in wellffar, I thanke God, and have ben evyr syns that I spake last
with yow; and mervayle for that ye sent never wryghtynge to me syns ye
departyd; I herde nevyr synes that tyme any worde out off Norffolk; ye
myght aft Bertlemai Feyr[109-2] have had messengers i nowe to London,
and iff ye had sent to Wykys, he scholde have conveyed it to me. I herde
yisterdaye, that a Worsted man of Norffolk, that solde worstedys[109-3]
at Wynchester, seyde that my Lord of Norffolk and my Lady wer on
pylgrymage at Our Lady[109-4] on ffoot, and so they went to Caster; and
that at Norwyche on scholde have had large langage to yow, and callyd
yow traytor, and pyked many quarellys to yow. Sende me worde ther off;
it wer well doo, that ye wer a lytell sewrer off yowr pardon than ye be:
avyse you, I deme ye woll her afftr ellys repent yow.

I undrestonde that Bastarde Fauconbryge[109-5] is owther hedyd or lyke
to be, and hys brother bothe; some men seye he wolde have deservyd it,
and som sey naye.

I purpose to be att London the ffyrst daye off the terme; send me worde
whethyr ye schall be ther or nott.

Item, I wolde wete whether ye have spoken wyth my Lady off Norffolk or
not, and off hyr disposicion and the howsoldys to me and to yow wardes,
and whether it be a possible to have Caster ageyn and ther goodewylles
or not; and also I praye yow undrestande what ffelaschyp and guydyng is
in Caster, and have a spye resortyng in and owt, so maye ye know the
secretys among them. Ther is moche adoo in the Northe, as men seyn;
I pray yow be ware off yowr guydyng, and in cheff off yowr langage, and
so that ffro hense fforthe by yowr langage noo man perceyve that ye
ffavor any person contrary to the Kynges plesur. I undrestonde that the
Lord Ryvers hathe lycence off the Kynge to goo to Portyngale now within
thys vij. nyght. I pray yow recomande me to my modre, and beseche hyr
off hyr blyssyng on my be halve.[110-1]

Item, I praye yow sende me worde iff any off owr ffrendys or wellwyllers
be dede, ffor I feer that ther is grete dethe in Norwyche, and in other
Borowgh townese in Norffolk, ffor I ensur you it is the most unyversall
dethe that evyr I wyst in Ingelonde; ffor by my trowthe, I kan not her
by pylgrymes that passe the contre, nor noon other man that rydethe or
gothe any contre, that any Borow town in Ingelonde is ffree ffrom that
sykenesse; God sease it whan it pleasyt Hym. Wherffor, ffor Goddysake,
let my moodre take heede to my yonge brytheren that they be not in noon
place wher that sykenesse is regnyng, nor that they dysport not with
noon other yonge peple whyche resortythe wher any sykenesse is, and iff
ther be any off that sykenesse ded or enffect in Norwyche, ffor Goddes
sake, lete hyr sende them to som ffrende off hyrse in to the contre, and
do ye the same by myn advyce; late my moodre rather remeve hyr
howsesolde in to the contre.

Even now Thyrston browt me word ffro London that it was Doctor Aleyn
that cawsyd yowr troble that ye had at Norwych; and that John Pampyng
roode ffor a dyscharge ffor yow, and that he hathe sped well, but

    [Footnote 115-1: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] There was a general

    also shown by the answer to it, written by Margaret Paston on the

    mutilation of the original MS., which is full of holes, from

ABSTRACT[117-1]

WILLIAM PEKOC TO SIR JOHN PASTON

[Sidenote: 1471(?) / NOV. 4]

Has received Wheteley's letter, but though he has spoken to Sir John's
tenants at Paston, Bakton, etc., has obtained no money to send him. They
are better pleased to pay Sir John than Master 'Will. P.,' so they be
saved harmless. Has put them in good comfort, and Sir John must take
care that they be not sued this term. The fishing was never worse. No
herring to be got under 13_s._ 4_d._ a barrel, and 8_s._ 4_d._ a cade.
The swans were sent the week after your departure. John Osborn and Munde
are merry. None dead at Caster and Mawteby since Michaelmas, but much
mortality still at Fylby, Ormysby, and Scrowby.

Mawteby, 4 Nov.

  [This letter most probably belongs to the year 1471, which it will
  be seen by the letter immediately following was a year of great
  mortality.]

[Sidenote: 1471 / NOV. 5]

I grete you wele, and send you Goddes blyssyng and myn, letyng you wete
that myn Cosyn Clere hathe sent to me for the C. marc that I borwed of
her for your brother. It fortuned so that a frend of her of late hath
loste better than CCC. marc, and he sent to her for money, and she had
non that she myght comyn by, and ther for she sent to me for the seyd C.
marc; and I know not how to do therfor, for by my trowth I have it not,
nor I can not make shyft therfor, and I shuld go to preson; therfor
comune with your brother her of, and send me word how that he wull make
shyft ther for in hast. I must elles nedes sell all my woods, and that
shall dysse avayll him better than a CC. marc, and I dey; and if I shuld
selle them now, ther wull noman gewe so myche for them be ner an C. marc
as they be worth, be cause ther be so many wood sales in Norfolke at

many persones now k[n]owyn it, which me semyth a greet rebuke to me that
I departyd so largely with yowr brother that I reservyd not to pay that
I was endaungered for hym, and so have dyverse seyd to me which of late
have k[n]owyn it; and whan I remembre it, it is to myn hart a very
spere, consideryng that he never gave comforte therein, ner of all the
money that hath be reseyvyd wull never make shyft therfor. And he had
yet be for thys tyme have sent me l. marc thereof, yet I wuld have
thought that he had had summe consideracion of myn daungers that I have
put me in for hym. Remembre hym how that I have excusyd hym of xx_li._
that the Prior of Bromholm had, which shuld elles have be in that
daunger that it shuld have be to us a grete rebwke, with hought that he
myght a ben holpyn wyth shuch money as he shuld have had of your fadyrs
bequest; and I payd to the shereffe for hym also money. All thes shuld
have holpe me wele therto, be syde other thynges that I have bor thys
yeres that I speke not of; there fore lete hym helpe me now, or elles it
shall dysawayll hym better than the trebyll the money, wheder that I
leve or dey, with ought he hath better consideracion to the daungers
that I stond in. Also I wulde ye shuld meve hym to take John Pampyng to
hym, or elles to gete hym a servyce in the Chauncery, or in sume other
place where as he myth be preferryd, for it ys pety that he lesyth hys

ABSTRACT[123-1]

[MARGARET PASTON] TO HER SON [SIR JOHN PASTON]

[Sidenote: 1471(?) / NOV. 20]

Wonders she has no answer to her letter by Ric. Raddeley. Wants him and
his brother to get a discharge from my Lord of Canterbury, 'for
occupying of your father's goods.' If my Lord died before we got it, his
successor might be 'more hasty upon us than he hath been.' My Lord knows
the great charges we have had since he deceased, which have caused the
goods to be spent. If any of us were to die, no one would take charge
for us unless we have a discharge. Remember the spices and malmsey I
have sent to you for.

St. Edmund's Day the King.

  _Sealed._

  [At the date of this letter, Sir John Paston and his brother John
  were together in London, and apparently the Archbishop of Canterbury
  was seriously ill. Of the latter fact we have no certain knowledge,
  but it appears by a subsequent letter that there was a report of his
  death in June 1472, and the two brothers were certainly in London
  together in November of the year preceding. It is probable therefore
  that the Archbishop was ill of the epidemic which prevailed in the
  latter part of 1471 and the spring of 1472. The two brothers were
  not together in November 1472.]

[Sidenote: 1471 / NOV. 29]

I grete zow welle, and send zow Goddes blyssyng and myn, letyng zow wete
that I have a letter from zour brother, wherby I undyrstand that he
cannot, ner may, make no porveyans for the C. mark; the wyche causythe
me to be rythgh hevy, and for other thynges that he wrytht to me of that
he is in dawnger. For remembering wat we have had befor thys and ho
symppylly yt hath be spente and to lytyl profythe to any of us, and now
arn in soche casse that non of us may welle helpe other with owte that
we schuld do that wer to gret a dysworschip for us to do, owther to
selle wood or lond or soche stuffe that were nessessary for us to have
in owr howsys; so mot I answer a for God, I wot not how to do for the
seyde money, and for other thyngges that I have to do of scharge, and my
worshup saved. Yt is a deth to me to thynk up on yt. Me thynkyth be zour
brothers wrythtyng, that he thynkyth that I am informed be sume that be
a bowthe me to do and to sey as I have be for thys, but be my trowthe he
demyth a mysse; yt nedyth me not to be informed of no soche thengges.
I construe in my owyn mend, and conseyve i now and to myche, and whan I
have brokyn my conseyte to sume that in happe he deniythe yt too, they
have put me in cownforth more than I kowde have be any imajynasyon in my
owyn conseythe. He wrythetyth to me also, that he hath spend thys terme
xl_li._ Yt is a gret thyng; me thynkyth be good dyscresyon ther mythe
myche ther of aben sparyd. Zour fadyr, God blysse hys sowle, hathe had
as gret maters to do as I trowe he hathe had thys terme, and hath not
spend halfe the mony up on them in so lytyl tyme, and hath do ryth well.
At the reverens of God, avyse hym zet to be war of hys expences and
gydyng that yt be no schame to us alle. Yt is a schame and a thyng that
is myche spokyn of in thys contre that zour faders graveston is not mad.
For Goddes love, late yt be remembyrd and porveyde for in hast. Ther
hathe be mych mor spend in waste than schuld have mad that, me thynkyth
be zour brother that he is wery to wrythe to me and there fore I wyl not
a kumbyr hym with wrythtyng to hym. Ze may telle hym as I wryth to zow.
Item, I woold ze schuld remembyr zour brother of Pekerngges mater, if he
cum not hom hastely, that ze and Townesend and Lumnor may examyn and
sette yt thorow. The pore man is almost on don ther by, and hys brother
suethe hym and trobylyth hym sor zet; and also for the plesur of my
koseyn Clere and the Lady Bolen, I woold yt were sette thorow.

As for my rowndlet of wyne, I schuld send zow mony there fore, but I dar
not put yt in joperte, ther be so many theves stereng. John Lovedayes
man was robbyd in to hys schyrte as he cam home ward. I trow, and ze
assaye Towneshend or Playter, or sum other good kuntery man of owrys to
lend yt zow for me tyl they cum hom, they wyl do so myche for me and I
schal contente them a geyn. Item, Jamys Gressham hath ben passyng sekke
and ys zet. Judy tellythe me that zour brother is avysed for to sue hym.
For Goddes sake, late non onkyndnesse be schewed to hym, for that woold
sone make an hend of hym. Remembyr ho keynd and true hartyd he hath ben
to us to hys powre; and he had nevere take that offyce upon hym that he
is in dawnger for, ne had be for owr sakkes. He hathe sold a gret parte
of hys lond there for, as I suppose ze have knowlache of. Late yt be
remembyrd, and ellys owr enmyes wyl rejoysyt, and ther wyl no wurshup be
ther in at long way.

I schuld wryth mor but I have no leyser at thys tyme. I trow ze wyl sone
kum hom, and there fore I wryth the lesse. God kepe zow and send zow
good speede, &c. Wretyn the Fryday, Sen Andrue Ev.

  Be zour modyr.

[Sidenote: 1471(?) / DEC. [1]]

I grete you wele, and send you Goddis blyssyng and myn. Desyryng you to
send me word how that your brother doth. It was told her that he shuld
have be ded, which caused many folkis and me bothyn to be right hevy.
Also it was told me this day that ye wer hurt be affray that was mad up
on you be feles disgysed. Ther fore, in any wyse send me word in hast
how your brother doth and ye bothyn; for I shall not ben wele at eas
till I know how that ye do. And for Goddis love lete your brother and ye
be ware how that ye walken, and with what felesshep ye etyn or drynkyn,
and in what place, for it was seid here pleynly that your brothere was
poysoned. And this weke was on of Drayton with me and told me that there
were diverse of the tenauntis seid that thei wost not what to do if that
your brothere came home; and ther was on of the Duk of Suffolkis men by,
and bad them not feryn, for his wey shuld be shorted and [_i.e._ if] he
shuld come there. Wherfore, in any wyse be ware of your self, for I can
thynk thei geve no fors what to do to be wenged and to put you from your
entent, that thei myght have her wyll in Ser John Fastolffis land.
Thy[nke][126-2] what gret sor[ow][126-2] it [shu]ld[126-2] be to me and
any . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . I had lever ye had
never know the lond; remembre it was the distruccion of your fadre;
trost not mych up on promyses of lordis now a days that ye shuld be the
suerer of the favor of there men. For there was a man, and a lordis
sone, seid but late, and toke it for an exampill that Sir Robert
Harecourt had the good will of the lordis after ther comyng in, and yet
within shorte tyme after here men kylled hym in hys owyn place. A mannes
deth is litill set by now a days. Therefore be ware of symulacion, for
thei wull speke ryht fayr to you that wuld ye ferd [_fared_] right
evyll. The blissid Trynyte have you in his kepyng. Wretyn in gret hast
the Saterday next after Sent Andrewe.

Lete this letter be brent whan ye have understond it. Item, I pray you
send me iiij. suger lofis, ich of them of iij_li._, and iiij_li._ of
datis if thei be newe. I send you x_s._ be the berer hereof; if ye pay
more I shall pay it you ageyn whan ye come home. And forgete not to send
me word be the berere hereof how ye don; and remembre the bylles and
remembrauns for the maner of Gresham that I wrote to your brother for.

  Be your moder.

    [Footnote 126-1: [Add. MS. 34,889, f. 211.] This letter may be of
    the year 1471, when it would seem by No. 791 that the two
    brothers, Sir John and John, were both together (in London, no
    doubt) about St. Andrew's Day. If so, it was written just two days
    after that letter, on the receipt of unpleasant news, which was
    evidently false.]

. . . . the very valew of Sporlewood passyth not C. mark of no manys

Crystmas, savyng for hys boord, xij_d._ a wek for iij. quarters; and he
seythe pleynly that ye and R. Calle both bad hym syng styll for Syr John
Fastolf as he dyd before; but I have bodyn hym that he shall get hym a

    [Footnote 127-1: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] This seems to be only a
    portion of a letter, beginning in the middle of a sentence.
    Probably it was a second leaf added to a more lengthy epistle. It
    is written on one side of a slip of paper and is in the hand of
    John Paston the younger. It is endorsed 'John Paston' in that of
    his brother Sir John, to whom it was doubtless addressed. The date
    must be towards the end of the year 1471, as it appears by the
    letter immediately following that Lord Rivers embarked for
    Portugal that year on Christmas Eve.]

MARGARET PASTON TO SIR JOHN PASTON[129-1]

[Sidenote: 1471]

I grete you wele; letyng you wete that ther was told me a thyng in your
absens that goth right nere myn hert, be a wurchepfull man and such an
as ye wuld beleve and geffe credence to, and that owyth you right good
wille; which if it had comyn to myn remembraunce at your departer I wuld
have spoke to you of it most specially befor all other materis; but I am
so trobilled in my mende with your materis that thei be so delayd and
take no better conclusion, and with the ontrowth that is in servantis
now a days but if the maysteris take better heed to ther handis, that
such thyngis as I wuld rathest remembre I sonest for gete. It was told
me that ye have sold Sporle wood of a right credebill and wurchepful
man, and that was right hevy that ye shuld be know of such disposicion,
consederyng how your fader, whos sowle God assoyl, cherysshed in every
manor his woodis. And for the more preffe that this shuld be trought,
the forseid person told me that it was told hym of on [_one_] that was
toward Sir William Yelverton, to whom Richard Calle shuld have seid in
thes termes, that Sporle Wood shuld be sold, and that it shuld comyn now
in to Cristen mennes handis. Which if it were knowyn shuld cause bothyn
your elmyse [_enemies_] and your frendis to thynk that ye dede it for
right gret nede, or ellis that ye shuld be a wastour and wuld wast your
lyvelod. If ye had do so in Sir John Fastolfes lyffelode, men shuld have
supposid that ye had do it of good pollice, be cause of the onsuerte
that it stoonit (?) in, to have takyn that ye had myght of it duryng
your possession, to have boryn ought the daungere of it with the same;
but for to do this of your owyn lyffelode, men shall thyng that ye do it
for pure nede. And in asmych as it is so nere your most elmyse ere, it
shall be to you the gretter vylney and shame to all your frendis, and
the grettest coragyng and plesere that can be to your elmyse. For if ye
be thus disposid ye shall make them and all othere certeyn of that that
befor this tyme thei haue ben in dought, and cause them to purpose the
more cruelly agayn you. Where fore, in eschewyng of the greet slaundre
and inconveniens that may grow ther of, I require you, and more over
charge you upon my blissyng and as ye wull have my good will, that if
any such sale or bargany be mad, be your assent or with ought, be Calle,
or any othere in your name, that ye restreyn it; for I wuld not for a
M^l marcs that it wer understond that ye were of that disposicion, ner
that ye were comyn to so gret nede which shuld cause [y]ou to do so; for
every [man[130-1]] shuld thynk that it were thurgh your owyn
mysgovernaunce. Therefore I charge you, if any such bargayn be mad, that
ye send a bill as hastly as ye can to Herry Halman, that he do all such
as have mad or takyn that bargayn seasse and felle non of the wood, upon
peyn that may falle ther of. And how [_who_] so ever wull councell you
the contrary, do as I advyse you in this behalffe, or ellis trost never
to have comfort of me; and if I may knowe ye be of such disposicion, and
I leve ij. yer it shall disavayll you in my liffelode ccc. marcs. There
fore, send me word be the berere here of wheder ye have assent to any
such thyng or nought, and how that ye be disposid to do ther in, for I
shall not be quiete in myn hert till I understand yow of the contrary
disposicion.

  Be your more moder.

shall no mony be takyn at Saxthorp tyll thys terme be past, for he hathe
promysyd me to spek with yow and your consell, and that ye shall tak a

at Saxthorp and to have be kep upon Holy Rood Day last past, and ther he
wold have gadyrd the half yere ferm, but it fortunyd me to be there ere
the coort was half done, and I took syche a wey with hym that the qwest

[_if_] ye be at London thys term; but and ye be not at London, I wold
avyse yow to let Townysend tak a wey with hym, for it lyeth not in my
power to keep werre with hym; for and I had not delt ryght corteysly up

reysyd as many men as he kowd mak in harneys to have holp Gornay; but
when Heydon sye [_saw_] that we delt so corteysly as we ded he withdrew

not se that he besyth hym abowght it, notwithstandyng I calle upon hym
dayly for it. As for mony, I can none get, neyther at Snaylewell nor at

I am fayn to borow the mony to pay it by that Lord I beleve on, for I

JOHN PASTON TO SIR JOHN PASTON[139-4]

[Sidenote: 1472 / MAY 25]

Ryght worchefull syr, I recomande me to yow, sertyfying yow that I was
purposyd to have com to London to have made my pese with my Lady of
Norffolk, but I undyrstand she is not in London; notwithstandyng that is
no cause of myn abydyng at hom, but thys is the cause, so God help
me,--I can get no mony, neythyr of your lyvelod ner of myn, to pay for
my costes, nor for to ease yow with at my comyng. Notwithstandyng I am
promysyd som at Snaylewell, and if so be that John can take eny ther, he
shall bryng it yow with this bylle. I send yow here ij. of my reknynges
that I have receyved and payd syn I delt with yowr lyvelod, and by thes
ij. and by that reknyng that I sent yow to London ye may know what is
receyved by me, and what I have payid; and howgh and when so evyr ye
wyll let your tenauntes and fermours at alle plasys be examynd, ye
shalle fynd it non othyr wyse. So God help me, as your lyvelod is payid,
it cannot paye your dettes in thys contre; for it drawyth up on a x_li._
that ye owe yet in thys contre, besyd the xii_li._ to Dawbney; and with
in thes vij. dayis I shall send yow a clere byll what ye owe, for ther
are axyid many thynges that I knewe not of when I was with yow.

Also I enswyr yow by my trowthe I saw my modyr nevyr sorer mevyd with no
mater in hyr lyve then she was when she red the byll that ye gave me
warnyng in that Perker had atainyd an axyon ayenst yow and me, for she
supposyth veryly that it is doon by myn oncyll William meanys, to mak
yow to sell your lond. But thys she comandyd me for to send yow word,
that and ye sell eny lond, but paye your dettes with syche good as my
Lord Archebyshopp owyth yow, and eny law in Inglond can put fro yow eny
of hyr lond, she sweryth by that feyth that she owyth to God she wyll
put fro yow dobyll as myche lond as ye selle. And therfor I wold avyse
yow, calle sharply upon my Lord, the Archebyshop, for ye ar not bond to
undo your sylf for hym.

Item, I pray yow se that I tak no hurt by Parker. As for myn oncyll W.,
I can not mak hym to send you the byll of syche stuff as he hathe of
yowrs. He seyth he woll, but he comyth no of with it.[140-1] He and I ar
fowly fallyn owght thys same day for a mater betwyx Lovell and Johne
Wallsam and hyr sustyr. Lovell hathe bowt Jone Walshamys part of hyr
lyvelod, and maryd hyr to a knave, and myn oncyll W. hathe oft spok with
my modyr and me for to delyver Jone Walshamys evydence to Lovell, whyche
I have in kepyng; and be cause I wyll not delyver Lovell the evydence
therfor we fyll owt, in so myche that he seyth he wyll stryppe me fro
the maner of Sweynsthorpe. Wherfor I pray yow in eny wyse send me by
John Mylsend a copye of the deed that I sent yow to London. Ther is in
the same deed Gresham and Snaylewell, and Sporle and Sweynsthorpe, alle
to gedyr I trow. And I prey yow let the date and the feoffeys namys, and
alle be set in. And I trust to God to mak yt so sewyr that he shall do
me lytyll harm. Gefrey Spyrlyng callyth oft up on me to undyrstand how
ye wyll delle with hym for hys plase in Norwyche. I pray you send me
woord by John what answer I may geve hym; he delyth alwey ryght frendly
with yow.

Item, I send yow here wyth Jamys Greshamys oblygacyon.

JOHN PASTON TO SIR JOHN PASTON[149-1]

_To my ryght worchepfull brodyr, Sir John Paston, Knyght._

[Sidenote: 1472 / SEPT. 21]

Ryght worchepfull sir, I recomand me to yow, letyng yow wet that your
desyer as for the Knyghts of the Shyer was an impossoybyl to be browght
abowght; ffor my Lord of Norffolk and my Lord of Suffolk wer agreid i
mor then a fortnyght go to have Sir Robert Wyngfeld, and Sir Rychard
Harcort, and that knew I not tyll it was Fryday last past. I had sent or
I rod to Framlynham, to warne as many of your frends to be at Norwyche
as thys Monday, to serve your entent as I koud; but when I cam to
Framlynham, and knew the apoyntment that was taken for the ij. knyghts,
I sent warnyng ayen to as many I myght to tery at hom; and yet ther cam
to Norwyche thys day as many as ther costs dreave to ix_s._ i_d._ ob.,
payid and reknyd by Pekok and R. Capron, and yet they dyd but brak ther
fest and depertyd. And I thankyd hem in your name, and told them that ye
wold have noo voyse as thys day, for ye supposyd not to be in Inglond
when the Perlement shold be, and so they cam not at the sherhous
[_shire-house_]; for if they had, it was thought by syche as be your
frends here, that your adversarys wold have reportyd that ye had mad
labor to have ben one, and that ye koud not bryng your purpose abowght.

I sent to Yermowthe, and they have promysyd also to Doctor Aleyn and
John Russe to be mor then iij. wekys goo.

Jamys Arblaster hathe wretyn a lettyr to the Bayle of Maldon, in Essex,
to have yow a bergeys ther; howe Jwde shall sped, let hym tell yow, when
ye spek to gedyr.

Syr, I have ben twyis at Framlyngham sythe your departyng, but now, the
last time the consayll was ther, I sye [_saw_] yow lettyr whyche was
bettyr then well endyghtyd. R. C.[150-1] was not at Framlyngham when the
consayll was ther, but I took myn owne avyse, and delyvered it to the
consayll with a propocysion ther with, as well as I kowd spek it, and my
wordys wer well takyn, but your lett[yr] a thousand fold bettyr. When
they had red it, they shewd it to my Lady.[150-2] Aftyr that my Lady had
sen it, I spok with my Lady offryng to my Lord and her your servyse, and
besyd that, ye to do my Lord a plesur[150-3] and hyr a bettyr, so as ye
myght depert wyth ought eny some specyfyid. She wold not tell in that
mater, but remyttyd me ayen to the consayll, for she seyd, and she speke
in it, tyll my Lord and the consayll wer agreed, they wold ley the wyght
[_blame_] of all the mater on hyr, whyche shold be reportyd to hyr
shame; but thys she promyseid to be helpyng, so it wer fyrst mevyd by
the consayll. Then I went to the consayll, and offyrd befor them your
servyse to my Lord, and to do hym a plesure, for the haveing ayen of
your place and londys in Caster, xl_li._ not spekyng of your stuff nor
thyng ellys. So they answerd me your offyr was more then resonabyll; and
if the mater wer thers, they seyd, they wyst what conscyence wold dryve
hem to. They seyd they wold meve my Lord with it, and so they dyd, but
then the tempest aros, and he gave hem syche an answer that non of hem
all wold tell it me; but when I axid an answer of them, they seyd, and
[_if_] som Lordys or gretter men mevyd my Lord with it, the mater wer
your (kepe consaile), and with thys answer I depertyd. But Syr W.
Brandon, Sothewell, Tymperley, Herry Wentworthe, W. Gornay, and all
other of consayll, undyrstand that ye have wronge, insomyche that they
mevyd me that ye shold take a recompence of other lond to the valew; but
they wold not avowe the offyr, for I anserd hem that if they had ryght
they wold have ofred no recompence. Dyscovyr not thys, but in my reason,
and [_i.e._ if] my Lord Chamberleyn[151-1] wold send my Lady a letter
with some privy tokyn betwyx theym, and allso to meve my Lord of
Norffolk when he comyth to the Parlement, serteynly Caster is yours.

If ye mysse to be burgeys of Maldon, and my Lord Chamberleyn wyll, ye
may be in a nother plase; ther be a doseyn townys in Inglond that chesse
no bergeys, whyche ought to do, and ye may be set in for one of those
townys, and ye be frendyd. Also in no wyse forget not in all hast to get
some goodly ryng, pryse of xx_s._, or som praty flowyr of the same
pryse, and not undyr, to geve to Jane Rodon, for she hathe ben the most
specyall laborer in your mater, and hathe promysyd hyr good wyll
foorthe, and she doeth all with hyr mastresse. And my Lord Chamberleyn
wyll, he may cause my Lord of Norffolk to com up soner to the Parlement
then he shold do, and then he may apoynt with hym for yow, or the ferm
corn[151-2] be gadryd. I profyrd but xl_li._, and if my Lord Chamberleyn
profyr my Lady the remenaunt, I can thynk it shall be taken. My Lady
must have somwhat to bye hyr kovercheff[151-3] besyd my Lord. A soper
that I payd for, wher all the consayll was at Framlyngham, ij_s._
iij_d._, and my costs at Framlyngham twyis lying ther by viii. dayis,
with ix_s._ i_d._ ob., for costs of the contre at Norwyche drawyth
abowght xx_s._, I trowe more: by our Lady, if it be lesse, stand to
your harmys, and _sic remanet_ v_li._ xiij_s._ iii_d._

I axe no more gods of you for all the servyse that I shall do yow whyll
the world standyth, but a gosshawke,[152-1] if eny of my Lord
Chamberleyns men or yours goo to Kaleys, or if eny be to get in London;
that is, a mewyd hawk, for she may make yow sporte when ye com into
Inglond a doseyn yer hens, and to call upon yow owyrly, nyghtly, dayly,
dyner, soper, for thys hawk. I pray noo more but my brother E.,
J. Pampyng, Thyrston, J. Myryel, W. Pytte, T. Plattyng Jwde, lityll Jak,
Mastyr Botoner, and W. Wood to boote, to whyche persons I prey yow to
comand me; and if all thes lyst to spek to yow of thys mater when Sir

I grete you wele; letyng you wete that on Saterday last past within

grete hurt and discoragyng of my fermour that is now of late come

he came from Yarmoth this weke and shotte at hym that if he had not had
a good hors he had belike to have ben in joparte of his lyfe; so that be
thes rewle I am like to lese the profite of the lyfelode this yere but
if there be purveyed the hastyere remedy. Thei threte so my men I dar
send non theder to gader it. Thei stuffe and vetayll sore the place, and
it is reported here that my Lady of Norffolk seth she wull not leas it
in no wyse. And the Duchesse of Suffolkis men sey that she wull not
departe from Heylesdon ner Drayton,--she wuld rather departe from money;
but that shuld not be wurchepfull for you; for men shull not than set be

money; ye shall mown excuse you be the College which must contynue
perpetuall, and money is sone lost and spent whan that lyfelode abideth.
Item, I lete you wete that Hastyngis hath entred ageyn in to his fee of
the Constabyllshep of the Castell of Norwich be the vertu of his patent
that he had of Kyng Harry; and I here sey he hath it graunted to hym and

    in 1476. The year 1472 may be considered very probable from what
    Margaret Paston writes in June of that year (No. 803).]

William[156-2] also axhyd me what words I had had to hyr at that tyme.
They seyd that my Lady seyde I gaff hyr ther off,[156-3] and that I

belye, ffor she cowde cheryshe itt, and dele warlye with it; in trowthe

Skalys. And som seye that thees imbassators come ffor moor men. And thys

I beleeff it not.

I sent yow worde off an hawke; I herde nott from yow syns; I do and
shall doo that is possible in suche a neede.

Also I canne nott undrestand that my Lord off Norffolk shall come heer

I grete you wele and send you Goddes blyssyng and myn, letyng you wete

Nevertherlesse she sent me an nother massenger, and lete me wete[159-2]
that her husband had sent her the same nyght from London that she shuld
come up as fast as she cowde to labor to the Lordes there in her propre
person; wherfor she myght geve me non answer, ner send you word how that
ye shuld do till [that] she had spokyn with her husband, or had other

Therfore I thynk t[hat s]he hath other councell that avyseth her to

of an nother seson, for so shall ye be disseyved a[s ye hav]e ben befor

shall . . kepe you low and in trobill. And if any mater . . . . . be Act

Item, remembre Lomnors mater as ye may do therin, and send me werd in

not nede to make my Lord to write, but whan that he comyth, if my Lord
can make hym to put it in indifferent and wurchepfull men, than that it
pleasith my Lord to write to them that thei shuld take it upon them to
set a rewle therin, with ought better advyse, me semyth it wer wele do.
The Holy Gost be your gyde and send yow good spede and councell, and
delivere you ought of all trobill and disseas to his pleser.

[Sidenote: 1472 / NOV. 22]

Please it yow to weete that I have opteyned letterys from the Kynge to

The Kynge hathe specially doon for me in thys case, and hathe pitte me,

speke with my Lady, for that she hathe takyn hyr chambre. Iff she be my
verry goode Ladye, as she hathe seyde hertoffor that she wolde be,
I hope that she wolle speke with hym. Neverthelesse I praye yow by the
meanes of Mestresse Jahne Rothen that [you][162-1] will have my Ladye
mevyd for me, and wher that herr to fore I wolde have departyd with C.
marke to have hadde hyr goode helpe and to be restoryd to my place;
whyche nott acceptyd, I tolde my seyde Lady that I feeryd that my power
sholde natt be ther aftre to gyff so large a plesyr, for at that tyme I
was in hope that the Bysshop of Wynchester sholde have payd it, thoghe
it hadde drawen a C_li._ Yet for as moche as men may nott lure none
hawkes with empty handys, I wolde yitt agre to gyffe my Lady xx_li._ for

Item, iff it be soo that itt be thowte behovefull, I thynke that thoghe
nowther Slyfelde, nor ye, brother John, maye come in to my Ladyes
chambre, that my moodre, iff she weer at Norwyche, she myght speke with

sholde meve my Lady moche. I thynke that ther most be some body for me,
havyng auctoryte to conclude for me, or ellys knowyng myn entente, they
myght make delaye, and seye they wolle at the Kynges enstance comon with
me; never the lesse I was nott ther present. Wherffor, rather than

so that the mater take effecte. I praye yow make hym goode cheer, and
iff it be so that he tarye, I most remembre hys costes; therffor iff I

Item, ye maye largely sey on my behalve for suche servyse that I sholde

make of money, what with the barke and with the asshe, at the leest l.
marke for to retayle the wode our selfe, and be Cristemas next after
that, other l. marke, and so yerely l. marke at Cristemesse as longe as

money be twix us, and therfore spare not to sende my master, Sir John,
worde to take suche dayes of payment as is a bove wreten, for it shalbe
performed what wey som ever we take be Godes grace.

Item, mastres, as for your write [_wright_] ye may not have hym tille

    years in possession of Caister, which was surrendered to him in
    September 1469. There can be no doubt therefore that it was
    presented or prepared for presentation at the time of John

Camberage, lesse than [_unless_] ye canne gytte onye carreours from
thens to Oxynforth more hastyly; and I mervell that the letters come not
to me, and whether I may laye the defaute to the fauder or to the son
therof. And I wold Water schuld be copilet with a better than Holler son
is, there as he schalbe; howe be it I wold not that he schuld make never
the lesse of hym, by cause he is his contre man and neghbour. And also I
pray you wryte a letter in my name to Watere, after that ye have knowne
myne entent by fore this to hym ward; so that he doo welle, lerne well,
and be of good rewle and disposycion, ther shall nothyng faylle hym that
I may helpe with, so that it be nessessare to hym; and bydde hym that he
be not to hasty of takyng of orderes that schuld bynd hym, till that he
be of xxiiij. yeere of agee or more, thoff he be consaled the contrare,
for oftyn rape [_haste_] rewith. I will love hym better to be a good
secular man than to be a lewit prest.

And I am sore that my cosyn Bernay is seke, and I pray you yeff me white
wine, or ony of my wateris, or ony other thyng that I have that is in
your awarde, may doo hym ony comforth. I lette hym have it; for I wold
be right sory yf ony thyng schuld come to hym botte good. And for
Godsake advise hym to doo make hys will, yeve it be not doo, and to doo
well to my cosyn, his wiff, and els it were pete; and I pray you to
recomaunde me to hyr, and to my nawnte, and to all the gentill men and
gentil women there. And as for John Daye, and he be dede I wold be sory,
for I know not howe to come by my mony that he oweith me; and I porpose
that Pacoke schall have les to doo for me another yeres than he haith
had, if I may be better porvayed with your helpe, for he is for hym
self, bott not for me.

And as for ony marchandes to my corn, I can gytte none here; therfor I
pray you, doo ye als wele therein as ye canne; also I send you by the
bereer hereof the bill of myne resaytes. And yef ye go forth with
Walter, I pray you come to me als sone as ye may after ye be commyn
home; and me lyketh myne abydyng and the contre here[175-1] right well,
and I trust whan sommer comith and fayre wether, I schall lyke it
better, for I am cherysed here botte to wel.

And I constrew your letter in other materis well i nough, whereof I
thanke you; and if it nede not to send forth Walter hastyly, I wald ye
myght come to me, thowe ye schuld com opon one day and goo agayne on the
next day, than schuld I comon with you in all materis; and I hold best
if ye have not the letteris that Holler son schuld have brough me, that
ye send Sym over for them this nyght that I may have them to morowe, and
yif ye may combe your self, I wold be the better playsed.

And I remember that water of mynte or water of millefole were good for
my cosyn Bernay to drynke, for to make hym to browke,[175-2] and yeve
thei send to Dame Elesebeth Callethorppe ther ye shall not fayill of the
tone or of both, sche haith other wateris to make folkis to browke. God
kepe you.

Wrytyn on the Monday next after Sent Hiller.

I have no longer leyser atte this tyme.

    [Footnote 173-1: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] The allusion by the
    writer to her cousin Berney's sickness makes it probable that this
    letter was written in 1473, when the Monday after St. Hilary would
    be the 18th of January. John Berney of Reedham died on the 20th
    January in that year (Inquis. _post mortem_, 13 Edw. IV., No. 17).
    The letter has neither signature nor address, but was probably
    written by Margaret Paston to her priest, Sir James Gloys, who
    died in the course of this year.]

NOTE

[Sidenote: 1473 / FEB. 10]

In Blomefield's History of Norfolk, vol. xi. p. 208, it is stated that
'on February 10 in the 13th of Edward IV., an indenture was made between
Sir William Yelverton, William Jenney, serjeant-at-law, and William
Worcester, executors of Sir John [Fastolf] on one part, and Thomas Cager
and Robert Kyrton on the other, whereby the said Robert was appointed
surveyor of the lands and tenements in Southwark and other places in
Surrey, late Sir John's, to perform his last will; and also receiver of
rents; who was to have 6 marks _per ann._, and to be allowed besides all
reasonable costs that he shall do in the defence and keeping out John
Paston, Esq., and of all others claiming by him.'

ABSTRACT[177-1]

'J. P.' [JOHN PASTON] TO SIR JOHN PASTON

[Sidenote: 1473 / MARCH 8]

As I promised in the letter that Playter sent, Playter and I have been
with my mother to get her to make chevesance for the L100, but she bade
us send you word, you need look for no other comfort from her. Jwde can
tell you Barker's answer. As for John Kook you promised him payment
yourself and to Sir John Styll 5 marks in part payment. My mother has
sold her barley for 14_d._ I never meet John Smyth but I speak of it to
him. He keeps his courts here at Norwich all the week. As for Fastolf,
I can only speak to Wymondham his father-in-law, which I do as often as
I see him. Would be sorry the great matter which requires hasty answer
'lest the kok be in perayle' should be delayed by his negligence. Thinks
Edmund Fastolf 'was a reasonable man to Robert of Lyne. Wherefore, let
my brother Edmund sue for the same, for one wife may serve for us both
till better peace be. So God help me ye may allege a plain excuse that
these dyrk wars have so hindered me that her lyvelode and mine both
should be too little to live at our ease till I were further before the
hand than I could be this two year, and she found after her honor and my
poor appetite.' Would rather forbear what he would have than bring them
in pain. 'Say better for me, for ye can and ye will. This matter must be
honestly handled, for I wot well my young lady of Oxenforthe shall hear
of it. We have here no tidings, but a few Frenchmen be whyrlyng on the
coasts, so that there dare no fishers go out but under safe conducts.
I pray you, and ye have any more oranges than ye occupy, that poor men
may have part for a great bellied lady.' First Monday of Clean Lent,
13 Edw. IV.

Raff Blaundrehasset wer a name to styrte an hare. I warrant ther shall

Ryght wyrshypfull and my ryght tendre modre, I recommaunde me to yow,
besechyng yow of yowr dayly blessyng. Please it yow to weet that I herde

acordyng but contraryaunt to other wryghtyng more comfortable that he
hadde sent me nott longe byffore that on yowr behalve, as he wrott,
whyche God amende. Neverthelesse to my more hevynesse, I herde seye that

performed me as largelye as was promysed me by Playter, I were sewre it
sholde nott have goon, nor yit sholde nat goo. Neverthelesse iff ye and
all my frendys and yowris in Norffolk myght have lende me so moche monye

have ben payed ageyn in a yer or ij. iff I had solde any woode.
Neverthelesse, plese yow to weet that I have provyd my fadres wyll and

admynestracion. And this instrument and aultoryte I beseche yow maye be

aqueynted with none suche at London, iff it please yowe to take and
avowe for your proctor and sende hym auctoryte, on [_one_] Master John
Halsnothe whyche was a clerke off Master Robert Centis[192-3] and was so
trusty to my fadre, God have hys sowle, and to sende me a letter off
yowre wylle ther in, I undertake that he shall not do but as ye sende me

SIR JOHN PASTON TO JOHN PASTON[196-2]

_To John Paston, Esquyer, be thys delyvered._

[Sidenote: 1473 / NOV. 22]

Ryght wyrshypfull and hertyly belovyd brother, I comand me to yow,
letyng you wet that I receyvyd a letter that come from yow, wretyn circa
viij. Mychaelys,[196-3] wherin ye leet me weet off the decesse off Syr
James, and that my moodre is in purpose to be at Norwyche, and I am
ryght glad that sche wyll now doo somwhat by yowr advyce; wherffor be
war fro hense forthe that noo suche felawe crepe in be twyen hyr and
yow, and iff ye lyst to take a lytell labore, ye may lyff ryght well,
and she pleasyd. It is as good that ye ryde with a cople off horse at
hyr cost as Syr James or Richard Calle.

Ye sende me worde also that she in noo wyse wyll purveye thyr C_li._ for
the redemyng off Sporle. Late it goo. As towchyng that mater, John
Osbern tolde me that he comonyd with yow at Sporle of that mater; ferr
he devysed that Kokett, or suche an other man, sholde, to have it the
better cheppe, leye owt the valewe off vj. yere for to have it vij.
yere, wherto I wolde agre; and for Goddys sake, if thatt maye be browt
abowt, late it be doon. As ye woot of, it is laten for xxij_li._ be
yere, yit the fermor graunt but xxj.; but to Kokett it wolde be worthe
xxv_li._, yea and better. Neverthelesse, if Kokett wyll delyver
vj^xx._li._, I wolde he had it for vij. yeer, with thys that my moodre
be agreable to the same, by cawse of th'entresse that she hathe for my
brother William, whyche shall nott be off age thys vij. yeer;
neverthelesse, as ye know myn olde entent, I purpose to purvey for hym
in an other plase better than theer; whyche graunte off my moodre I
praye yow to be my solycytor in, whyche [and] it be browt abowt, Sporle
shall be in as goode case as evyr he was.

John Osbern willyd me to make yow a sufficiaunt waraunt to selle and
felle wood at Sporle, whyche I remembre ye have in as ample forme as can
be; neverthelesse iff thys meane above wretyn off letyng to ferme maye
be hadde, it shall, I hope, nat nede to felle ner selle moche. But I
remytte that geer to yowr dyscrescion, but iff ye have suche comforte,
I praye yow sende me worde. I maye seye to yow, John Osbern flateryd me,
for he wolde have borowyd mony off me.

Item, in retaylyng of woode theer, it weer harde to tryst hym; he is
nedye. If Kokett, or whoo so evyr had that maner to ferme for vij. yere,
and payd therffor but vj^xx._li._, he sholde, to lete it ageyn, wynne
xxxvj_li._, whyche we[re] moche; wherffor, iff it myght bee, yt wer more
resenable vj^xx. vij_li._ to be reseyvyd, and yit is ther lost
xxix_li._, or ellys iff ye take lesse mony and fewer yerys, so it be
aftre the rate, so ther be purveyd C_li._ at the lest; send worde.

Item, ye wroot that lyke a trewe man ye sende me xviij_s._ by Richarde
Radle. Ye weer to trewe; but he semys to be a false shrewe, for he browt
me noon yitt. Whethyr he be owt of town or nott, kan I nott seye.

Ye prayed me also to sende yow tydynges how I spedde in my materis, and
in cheff of Mestresse Anne Hault. I have answer ageyn fro Roome that
there is the welle of grace and salve sufficiaunt for suche a soore, and
that I may be dyspencyd with; neverthelesse my proctore there axith a
m^l. docatys, as he demythe. But Master Lacy, another Rome renner heer,
whyche knowyth my seyde proctor theer, as he seythe, as weell as Bernard
knewe hys sheeld, seythe that he menyth but an C. docates or CC. at the
most; wherffor afftre thys comythe moor. He wrote to me also, _quod Papa
hoc facit hodiernis diebus multociens_.

Item, as towchyng Caster, I tryst to God that ye shall be in it to myn
use or Crystmesse be past.

Item, yowr ost Brygham recomand hym to yow, and when he and I rekenyd,
I gave hym ij. noblis for yowr borde, whyll ye weer theer in hys
absence; but in feythe he wolde, for nowth that I kowde doo, take j_d._
Wherffor ye most thanke hym or charge me to thanke hym on yowr behalve
in some nexte epystyll that ye wryght to me to Caleys. He leete me weet
that he wolde do moor for yow than soo.

Item, my Lady Bowgcher was almost deed, but she ys amendyd. I trowe they
come in to Norffolk.

Item, as for W. Berker, I heer no worde from hym. I praye yow comon with
Berney ther in, he knoweth myn conceyt; and also I praye yow hast Berney
ageyn. I wold not that he played the fooll, ner wastyd hys tyme ner hys
sylver.

Item, as for the brace of growndes [_greyhounds_], or one verry goode,
or in especiall the blak of Germynes, I can nott seye but ye be a trewe
man, but William Mylsent isse a false shrewe, so mote I thee, and I trow
hys master ys too.

Item, I most have myn instrumentes hydder, whyche are in the chyst in my
chambre at Norwyche, whyche I praye yow and Berney to gedre joyntly, but
natt severally, to trusse in a pedde,[199-1] and sende them me hyddre in
hast, and a byll ther in how many peces. Thys most be had to avoyde
idelnesse at Caleys.

Item, I preye yow take heed among thatt my stuffe take noon harme, ner
that myn evydence, wher ye wott of, be owt of joperte.

Item, I praye yow doo for Berneye as ye kan, so that he maye be in
sewerte for hys annywyte, and that it be nott costious fro hense forthe
to hym any mor to come, or sende for it. I pray yow wynne yowr sporys in
hys mater.

Item, I purposed to have sent heer with the testament off my fadre and
the scytacions to my moodre to yow and Arblaster; but they be nott redy.
Within ij. dayes aftre the comyng of thys, I suppose they shall be with
yow, and than I shall wryght mor to yow.

As for other tydynges, I trust to God thatt the ij. Dukes of Clarans and
Glowcester shall be sette att one by the adward off the Kyng.

Item, I hope by the means of the Duke of Glowcester that my Lord
Archebyshop[199-2] shall come home.

Item, as towchyng my sustre Anne,[199-3] I undrestand she hathe bene
passyng seek; but I wende that she had ben weddyd. As for Yelverton, he
seyde but late that he wold have hyr, iff she had hyr mony, and ellis
nott; wherffor me thynkyth that they be nott verry sewre. But, amonge
alle other thynges, I praye yow be ware that the olde love of Pampyng
renewe natt. He is nowe fro me; I wott nat what he woll doo.

No more. Wretyn at London, the xxij. daye of Novembre Anno R. R. E.
iiij^ti xiij^{o}.

NOTE

[Sidenote: 1474 / FEB. 9]

It appears by the Early Chancery Proceedings printed by the Record
Commission (vol. i. p. xc.), that a decree was given in Chancery in
Hilary term, 13 Edw. IV. compelling William Paston and other trustees to
fulfil a covenant between Richard, Duke of Gloucester and Elizabeth,
Countess of Oxford. On the Close Roll, 13 Edw. IV. memb. 1, is a release
by William, Bishop of Ely, Sir Thomas Montgomery, John Wentworth, clk.,
William Paston, Esq., Roger Townesend and Jas. Arblaster to Richard,
Duke of Gloucester, of all their right in Ocle Magna and Parva, etc., in
Essex, which they have by enfeoffment of Eliz., Countess of Oxford, and
in other manors in Norfolk and Suffolk which they lately had of the gift
of the same. This release is dated 9th Feb. 13 Edw. IV., and was
acknowledged in Chancery on the 11th Feb. Below it are enrolled three
other deeds by the Countess and her feoffees to the Duke, dated 9th
June, 12 Edw. IV., and acknowledged in Chancery, 25th June, 14 Edw. IV.

desired you to goo over unto Guysnes to yeve youre attendaunce and
assistaunce upon my brother Sir Rauf Hastings in all suche things as
concerne the suretie and defense of the Castell of Guysnes during his
infirmyties; it is shewed unto me that ye have full truely and
diligently acquyted you unto my saide brother, in all his besynesses
sithe your comyng thider. Whereof I thanke you hertly. And as I conceive
to my grete comfort and gladnesse, my saide brother is wele recovered
and amended, thanked be God. And soo I truste he may nowe spare you.
Wherupon I have writen unto him, if he may soo doo, to licence you to
come over unto me ayen. Wherefore I woll and desire you, th'assent of my
saide brother had, to dispose you to come over in all goodly haste, as

    [Footnote 204-1: [From Fenn, ii. 296.] I cannot discover in what
    year John Paston could have been staying at Guisnes during the
    month of April at the request of Lord Hastings, unless it was in
    the year 1474. There seems no other probable year in which we have
    not distinct evidence of his being elsewhere.]

SIR RALPH HASTINGS TO JOHN PASTON[205-1]

_To my feithful lovyng gode cousyn, Johan Paston._

[Sidenote: 1474(?) / MAY 9]

Cousyn Paston, I recommaunde me to you in as speciall wise as I cane.
And like you to witte, on Sondaye at even last I hadde writing and
evedence frome my lorde by Punche of tidyngis and have understonde them
wel al a longe. And on Monday erly in the mornyng I came to Calais to
have spoken with you, but I came to late. Praying you to advertise my
lord[205-2] to se wel to him self, etc. And at my comyng home the same
nyght I felle doune syke, and have ever sith kept my bedde and yitte do.
And, as you knowe wel, the Connestable sykened with you in his goyng to
Calais, of whome I doubt me, and so I do of my self bothe. So that here
amongis us nowe is no man to stirre about and see quykly to alle thingis
as ther aught to be and is nede to be, which hevieth me gretly; and
though I were up and might somwhat stire myself, yitte I am not seure so
to contynue ij. daies to-geder, etc. As for moo men, my Lord hathe
praied me and advised me to holde me content with thoo that I have, and
that I shulde make as litel coste in reparacions as I maye, because he
cannot se wel howe the monney cane be goten to content them. Cousyn, as
for moo men ye knowe right wel thoo that we have are to fewe, and we
have nede; notwithstonding I shal do as wel as I may with thoo that I
have. But as [for][205-3] eny ferther reparacions, might I ones for oure
seurte have this fournisshed that I am about, I kepe not to make moo,
for I doubt me that this we are about, that parte therof wil reste in my
nekke, because we cane not be seure of oure assignement. I pray you,
cousyn, brekes to my Lord all suche maters that ye cane remembre and
thinke[205-4] may be for the wele of us and the seurte of this place, as
my ful speciall truste and alle othir mennes here is in you. I hadde
thought to have writton to my lord to have sente some othir seure man
hidre to have assisted and holpen us during oure infirmitees, but I fele
by Punche that my Lord saith I write always so plainly to him that hit
fereth him, and therfore I dar not but shal forbere to write any more
so; howe be hit, it were ful necessarye and behofful so to do, that
knoweth God, Who ever preserve you. Writton at Guysnes, the ix^e daye of
May.

I praye you to sende us some of your tidingis by this berer as oft as ye
may. And if ther be anything I may do to your plesir, I shal do it with
as good hart as ye cane desire.

THE VICAR OF PASTON TO MARGARET PASTON

[Sidenote: 1474 / NOV. 3]

When my master Sir John's baily was at Paston he scared your tenants,
bidding them pay no rents to Mr. William Paston. On which Harry Warns
wrote to Mr. William, who bade him warn them not to pay money to any one
else; otherwise he would meet them at London 'as the law would,' or at
some market or fair, and make them pay arrears to Midsummer. Beware of
Warns, for he made Master William privy to all the examinations of the
tenants by my master your son. He also charged the tenants not to sell
as my master desired, else Master William would undo them. '_Ideo_,
putte no trost in hym, _quia duobus dominis nemo potest servire_.'
Pastun, 3 Nov.

  [This and the letter following both appear to have been written at
  the time of Sir John Paston's dispute with his uncle William, at the
  end of the year 1474.]

ABSTRACT[209-1]

[THE VICAR OF PASTON] TO MRS. [MARGARET PASTON]

[Sidenote: 1474]

John Qwale, farmer of Paston, is distressed by things that Herry Warns
has done and said against him. Warns carried home 'an esse' [_ash_]
blown down by the wind, and says it is your will, because Master John
Paston has given him power over all that he has in Paston. 'More awre he
stondes in grete dowte to ery or to sawe' [_to harrow or to sow_], for
John of Bactun says he shall have no land, unless he find surety, 'and
it were no resun that he suld somerlay and compace hys londes to a noder
mans hand.' Warns says if Qwale put out any cattle at the gates, he will
take it for the grain that Master William delivered to him. He says Mrs.
Margaret Paston[209-2] has no rule there, and shall have none; also that
John Qwale shall not have Gyns close nor the Chyrche close, as he has
taken them to farm. 'Qwere fore, bott ze gyfe hym oderwas power, he wyll
gefe up all.'

    Little more can be said about the contents than that they refer to
    money matters between William Paston and his nephew Sir John,
    which are probably those referred to in succeeding letters. The
    handwriting is that of William Paston. A mutilated endorsement,
    apparently in the handwriting of John Paston the younger, shows

[Sidenote: 1474]

Ryght wyrshypfull and my moste kynde and tendre moodre, I recomaund me
to yow, thankyng yow off the grete cost and off the greet chere that ye
dyd to me and myn at my last beyng wyth yowe; whyche cheer also hath
made me perfyghtly hooll, I thanke God and yow, in so moche that where
as I feeryd me that for weykenesse, and so green recuveryd off my
syknesse, that I scholde have apeyryd by the weye; but, God thanke yow,
I toke so my crommys whyls I was wyth yow, that I felyd my sylfe by the
weye that God and ye had made me stronger than I wenyd that I had ben,
in so myche that I feell my selffe every daye holler than other.

It was soo that I mett wyth myn onkle William by the weye, and there in
the felde I payed hym the iiij_li._ whyche I had borowyd off hym; and he
was passyng inquisytyff howe that I was purveyd for recompensyng off
Towneshend. I tolde hym I hopyd weell; he tolde me that he undrestood
that I had the C_li._ of the Bysshopys executores, and he had herde seye
that I had also borowyd another C_li._ of a marchaunt, and so I lakyd
but an C. marke. I deme he herde thys of T. Lovell, for I tolde hym that
I was in hope to fynde suche a freende that wolde lende me C_li._ He
axed me, who was that? I answeryd hym, an olde marchaunt, a freende of
myn, but myn oncle thowte that shold be by weye of chevyshanse
[_usury_], and to myn horte; wherffor I was pleyne to hym, and tolde hym
that ye wer sewerte therffor, and purveyed it off suche as wolde doo for
yowe. And as for the forte [_fourth_] C. mark, he seyde to me that as
for that he wolde, rather than joperte sholde be, purvey it by weye off
chevyshaunce at London, in so moche that, er he come fro London, he had
for my sake leyde v. C. markes worthe of plate with Hewghe Fenne. The
place at Warwykes Inne is large, and my grawntdame is agyd; it had ben
jopertous to leve moche plate wyth hyr, thoghe halffe were hyr owne. But
if I maye do other wyse, I purpose nott to chevyshe any mony by hys
meane.

Item, I have delyveryd yowre botell to Courbye the caryer thys same
daye, and he promysed me to be with yow on Mondaye nyghte, or ellys on
Touesday tymely. He hathe also xl_d._ to paye for the thryd hyryd horse,
and he bryngythe the iij. horse wyth hym, and is contente for hys labor
and for the mete largely. They be delyveryd hym in as good, and rather
better plyght, than whan I had them forthe, and not gallyd nor hurte. He
hate also ij. sadelys, one of my brotheres, and one other hyred, as ye
woot off.

Item, he hathe a peyre botys off Edmond Reedes, the shomaker, whyche
Saundre borowyd off hym. I beseche yowe that William Mylsent or Symme
maye se that every man have hys owne.

Item, as for my brother Edmond, blyssyd be God, he is weell amendyd.

Item, as for Hankyn owr dogge, I am a fferde never to see hym, but if
[_unless_] yowr good helpe bee.

Item, as for the bookes that weer Sir James, iff it lyke yow that I maye
have them, I ame not able to by them; but somwhat wolde I gyffe, and the
remenaunt with a goode devowte herte, by my trowthe, I wyll prey for hys
sowle. Wherffor iff it lyke yow by the next messenger or karyer to sende
hem in a daye, I shall have them dressyd heer; and iff any off them be
claymyd here aftre, in feythe I wyll restoor it.

of the promys that he had mad to me befor that he shuld not delyver them
to non withowt my assent. I seyd to hym that I suppose veryly that yowyr
brodyr hys a greyd with yowyr hunkyll that he shuld paye all the hole,

[Sidenote: 1475]

Ryght welbelovyd son, I gret yow well, and send yow Goddes blyssyng and
myn, letyng yow wete that I marveyle that I have had no wrytyng from yow
sethyn ye sent me the lettyr that ye sent me be for the Kynges comyng to
Norwych; in the whyche lettyr ye wrot to me that ye shuld a wretyn azeyn
to me or ye shuld de part owt of London. It ys so that yowyr hunkyll
William hath do payd to my cosyn Robard Clere but iiij^xx._li._ of the
C_li._ and he wol no mor pay but yf [_unless_] he hath delyveraunc of my
plegges, the wych was leyd to plegg for xx^ti_li._; the wych ben bettyr.
I wot well, be cause of the good well that he owyt to me, as ye know, he

therfor, that I myth have my plegges ageyn, for I war loth that they
shuld com in hys fyngyers.

Item, as for Sporyl wood, be ffor the Kynges comyng into Norffolk,
I myth an had chapmen to abowtyd [_have bought it_] a gret [_in whole_]

bycause of the gret good that the pepyll ys leyd to for the Kyng; werfor
we ar a bowth to retaylyt as well as we may, and as well as yt can be
browth too; and I send yow word how we shall do as astely as I may. As
for yowyr barly in thys cuntre, yt cannot be sold above x_d._ or xj_d._;
that ys the gretest prys of barly her, and but yt be at a bettyr prys,
I purpose for to do yt malt. And as for mony, I cowd not get yet of
Pecok but iij_li._; and he seth that be than that the owt chargys be
boryn, and the repracion of the myll at Wyntyrton, we ar lyke to have
but lytyll mor mony besyd the barly. Malt ys sold her but for xiij_d._
and whet ij_s._ or xxvj_d._ at thys time, and otys xij_d._ Ther ys non
owtlod suffyrd to goo owth of thys cuntre as yet; the Kyng hath
comaundyd that ther shuld non gon owth of thys lond. I fer me that we
shall have ryth a straung ward [_world_]; God a mendyd, whan Hys wyll
ys. I thank yow for the flakons that ye sent me; they be ryght good, and
plesyth me ryght well: I shall be as good an huswyff for yow as I can,
and as I wold be for myselff. Send me word how ye doo of yowyr syknes
that ye had on yowyr hey [_eye_] and yowyr lege; and yff God wol nowt
suffyr yow to have helth, thank Hym therof, and takyt passhently, and

grase to do; and as I have seyd to yow beffor thys, I wold ye war
delyveryd of my mastres A. H.,[223-1] and than I wold trost that ye
shuld do the bettyr.

As for the bokys that ye desyryd to have of Syr Jamys,[223-2] the best
of alle and the fayrest ys cleymyd; ner yt ys not in hys inventory.
I shall a say to get yt for yow, and I may; the prys of the todyr bokys,

zow the very cause why. Yt happyd hym to have a knavys loste, in pleyn
termes to swhyve a quene, and so dyd in the Konyneclosse. Yt fortunyd
hym to be a spyed be ij. plowemen of my modyrs, whyche werne as fayne as
he of that mater, and desyerd hym to have parte, and as kompany
requeryd, seyd not nay; in so myche that the plowemen had her alle a
nythe in ther stabylle, and Gregory was clere delyvered of her, and as
he swherys had not a do with her within my modyrs place. Not with
standdyng my modyr thynkks that he was grownd of that matier; wherfor
ther is no remedy but he moste a voyde. And in so myche that at the

can not plese all partys. But that jantylman[231-2] is hys woords Lord,
he hathe seyd that he woold lyfte them whom that hym plese, and as that
scheweyt welle, he lyftyd on [_one_] xiiij. myle in a mornyng, and nowe
he hath ben caw sar of hys lyfte, I wot not how far, but yf that ze be

that we never thryve. And that is hys intente, I trowe, to bryng us to;
wherfor I requer zow, yf that yt plese zow to have hym, that ze wylle be

as farforthe as I knowe, he is as true as any on lyve.

I troste my fortune schale be better than ever to leve thus her; but yf
I wer hens wards, I ensuer zow I wold not schange for none that I knowe.

    [Footnote 231-1: [From Fenn, iii. 426.] This letter was wrongly
    attributed by Fenn to Edmund Paston, son of the Judge. It is in
    the hand of the Judge's grandson, also named Edmund, and was
    written at a time when his mother Margaret was living at Mautby,
    where he, the writer, was also at the time, though he expected to
    join his brother John, to whom he writes, in the following week.
    These circumstances strongly suggest that it was written in 1475,
    when Margaret Paston certainly was residing at Mautby, as we find
    Edmund Paston with his brother John in London a month later
    preparing to go over to Calais. _See_ No. 873. Whitsun Eve in 1475

    [Footnote 235-1: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] This letter must have
    been written in the year 1475, when, as will be seen by No. 871,
    some of Sir John Paston's brothers, among whom doubtless were both
    John and Edmund, to whom this letter is addressed, were going over
    to Calais. The Bishop of Lincoln (Rotherham) was Chancellor in
    1475. It is true the Great Seal was taken from him on the 27th
    April, and given to Alcock, Bishop of Rochester, until the 28th
    September, when it was restored to Rotherham. But it is certain
    this letter could not have been written in a later year, as the
    Duke of Norfolk died in January 1476.]

Caster a yen, labore to get a lettre fro the Kyng dyrect to R.
Sothewell, Jamys Hubbard, and other of my lordys consayll being, and to
iche of theym; and in the seyd letter to lete theym have knowlage that
the Kyng mevyd to my lord of the seyd mater beyond the see, and hough my
lord answerd the Kyng that at hys comyng in to Inglond he wold meve to
hys seyd consayll of the seyd mater, and geve the Kyng an answer.
Wherfor the Kyng in the seyd lettyr must streyghtly charge theym, and
iche of theym, to comon with my lord in the seyd mater in syche wyse
that the Kyng may be sertyfyed of an answer fro my lord and theym at the
ferthest by _crastino Animarum_;[238-2] for Suthewell nor Jamys Hubbard
shall not be at London befor Halowmass, and thys is the best wey that ye
may take, as we thynke here.

Sir W. Brandon[240-1] stood by, and the Kyng axid hym what my lord wold
do in that mater; seying that he had comandyd hym befor tyme to meve my
lord with that mater, and Sir W. Brandon gave the Kyng to answer that he
had doone so; then the Kyng axid Sir W. B. what my lordys answer was to

shold as soone have hys lyff as that place; and then the Kyng axid my

[Sidenote: 1475]

Aftyr all dewtes of recomendacyon, in as humbyll wyse as I can,
I beseche yow of your blyssyng. The cheff cause that I wryght to yow for
at thys season is, for that I undyrstand that my lady[241-2] wold be
ryght glad to have yow a bought hyr at hyr labore; in so myche that she
hathe axyd the questyon of dyvers gentyllwomen whedyr they thought that
ye wold awayte on hyr at that season or nought, and they answerd that
they durst sey that ye wold, with ryght good wyll, awayte on hyr at that
tyme, and at all other seasons that she wold comand yow. And so I thynk
that my lady wyll send for yow; and if it wer your ease to be here,
I wold be ryght glad that ye myght be here, for I thynk your being here
shold do gret good to my brodyrs maters that he hathe to sped with hyr.
Wherfor, for Godes sake, have your horse and all your gere redy with
yow, whersoever ye be, ought or at home, and as for men, ye shall nott
need many, for I wyll come for yow, and awayte on yow my sylf, and on or
ij. with me; but I had need to undyrstand wher to fynd yow, or ellys I
shall happyly seeke yow at Mautby, when ye be at Freton, and my lady
myght then fortune to be ferforthe on hyr jorney or ye cam, if she wer
as swyfte as ye wer onys on Good Fryday.

And as for the mater in the latter end of my brodyr Sir Johnys lettyr,
me thynk he takyth a wronge wey, if he go so to werk; for as for the
peopyll here, I undyrstand non other but that all folkys here be ryght
well dysposyd towardes that mater, fro the hyghest degre to the lowest,
except Robart Brandon and John Colvyll; and it is a grete lyklyhod that
the grettest body is well dysposyd towardes that mater, in as myche as
they wold put yow to the labore above wretyn, and if they wer not,
I thynk they wold not put yow to that labore.

Also here was here with me yesterday a man fro the Priour of Bromholme
to lete me have knowlage of the ille speche whyche is in the contre now
of new, that the tombe is not mad; and also he seythe that the clothe
that lythe over the grave is all toryn and rotyn, and is not worth
ij_d._, and he seythe he hathe pachyd it onys or twyis. Wherfor the
Pryour hathe sent to yow at the leest to send thedyr a newe clothe a
yenst Estern.

Also Mastyr Sloley prayith yow, for Godes sake, and ye wyll do non
almess of tylle [_tile_] that he myght borow some of yow tyll he may bye
some, and pay yow ayen; for on [_one_] the fayrist chambyrs of the
Fryers, standyth half oncoverd for defaulte of tylle, for her is yett
non to get for no money. And the Holy Trynyte have yow in kepyng.

SIR JOHN PASTON TO EDWARD IV.[242-1]

_[To the King] our souverain Lord._

[Sidenote: 1475]

[SHEWETH] unto your highnesse your feythful liegeman and servaunt, John
Paston, Knight, that wher Sir William Yelverton, William Jenney, and
Thomas Howes were infeffed in certain . . . . . [to the] use of your
said suppliaunt, they of grat malice confetered with oon or ij. of the
counsell of my lord the Duc of Norffolk, caused the same Duc to clayme
tytle unto [the mano]ir of Caster and other lands of your said
suppliant, wherinne the said Yelverton and his coofeffees wer infeffed,
contrary to th'entent and wille that thei wer enfeffed for; upon whiche
title the said Duc with great force asseyed and entred the said manoir
of Castre and other lands of your said suppliant, putting hym from the
lawful possession and estate that he had in the same, and also take from
him vj^c. shepe and xxx. nete, and the same, with other stuf and
ordinaunces longing to the same manoir, of the value of C_li._ toke and
caryed awey, and the said manoir diffaced, hurt, and appeired, so that
it coude not be repaired with CC. marc. Also the revenues of the said
lands by the space of iij. yeres, to the value of vij^xx._li._, the same
my lord the Duke receyved, and the owtrents of the same never payed,
whiche great trouble was like to be the undoing of your said suppliant;
wherfor he was fayn to sue to the said Duc and lord by the meanes of his
godsip the Bisshop of Wynchestre, whiche was in his special favour; at
whos contemplacion, and for v^c. [500] marc whiche the same your
suppliant payed unto the same Duc, he graunted him to have agen his said
manoir and lands, and to restor him to the possession of the same,
whiche was so doen. And your said suppliant being in peasible
possession, my said lord the Duc and his cofeffees, Sir William Brandon,
Thomas Hoo, Rauf Ashton, and other, at the desir of my said lord,
relessed their estate and interesse, as wel under my said lordes sele as
under their own sele. Wherupon your said besecher continued in
possession but half a yer; at whiche time he was chargid in reparacions
to the somme of C. marc, and payed the owt rents dewe by the space of
the said iij. yer to the some of xl_li._ That doon, my said lord, by
sinistre motive and advice, with force agen entred the said manoir and
other lands aforsaid with alle stuf of howshold being in the same manoir
to the value of C. marc, and so long time hath kept and rejoysed the
revenues of the said lands, and in chief the said manoir, to the value
of vj^xx._li._ by the space of iiij. yer and mor; for redresse wherof
yor said suppliant hath this said space of iiij. yer sued to my said
lord and his counsell, and of alle that time the same my lord wold never
suffre him to come in his presence, ne here him, ne noon other for him
to declair or shewe his grief. And furthermor whanne your said besecher
hath sued to the counsel of my said lord, and desired them to move his
lordship therinne, and to answer him resonably and according to right,
they answered that thei have shewed my said lord his request, and that
he was, and is alwey, so moved and displesed with them, that thei dar
nomor move him therinne. And thus yor said suppliant hath loste alle his
coste and labour, to his charge by his feyth this iiij. yer in his sute,
the somme of v^c. marc, and now is owt of remedye, without your
habundant grace be shewed in that behalve, in somoche as he is not of
power t'attempt your lawes ayenst so mighty and noble estate, nor
t'abide the disples of him. Wherfor please it your moost noble grace, at
the reverence of God, to move my said lord to withdrawe the affeccion
whiche he so hath to the said manoir and lands, and to suffre your said
besecher to have and enjoye the possession of the same according
to right; and he at your commandment shal relesse unto my said
lord alle the damages above wretyn, whiche amount to the somme of
m^{l.}ccc.liij_li._ vj_s._ viij_d._, and in time to come, with Goddes
grace, be the mor hable to do you service, and also specially preye to
God for the conservacion of your moost noble persone and estate royall.

    [Footnote 242-1: [From a MS. in the Bodleian Library.] The Castle
    of Caister was surrendered to the Duke of Norfolk in September
    1469, but he must have been taking the rents of the manor for a
    year or two before. From what is stated in this petition, the Duke
    must have given it up again in the end of the year 1470, _i.e._
    during the restoration of Henry VI.; but he entered again after
    half a year, and the date of this second entry is given by William
    Worcester as the 23rd June 1471. After this, the petition says, he
    kept possession for four years and more, so that the date of the
    document must be towards the close of the year 1475. The Duke died
    on the 17th January 1476.]

ABSTRACT[244-1]

ROBERT WHYNBERGH TO SIR JOHN PASTON

Has ridden 100 miles to get out the obligation of Craksheld and Salter.
Has been opposed by Mr. Lovell, as they are his tenants. Understands it
is in my lord's closet, and the tenants are warned to pay no money
without it. They keep from him the farm of the Priors Maner as well as
Strehalle.[244-2] Desires him to write to Mr. William Paston to inform
my lord of a wrongful distress taken by John Markham at Strehall in
Cressingham, which is held of the King's manor of Necton. They took
cattle in lambing time in March, in the 14th year of this King, 'and put
Craksheld and Salter in such fear of losing of their cattle that they
were bound to my lord by obligation, and Craksheld is dead for thought.'
Will take the letter to Mr. William though it cost him fourteen days'
labor. Was five weeks riding 'to Canterbury, and again I will no longer
drive, for in winter I may not ride,' etc.

  [From the reference to 'the 14th year of this King,' it is evident
  that this letter was written after 1474, the 14th year of Edward IV.
  It may, perhaps, be of the reign of Henry VII.; in which case it was
  addressed to the younger John Paston, who was then a knight, his
  brother being dead, about the year 1500.]

    [Footnote 244-1: [From Paston MSS., B.M.]]

    [Footnote 244-2: Street-Hall or Straw Hall, in Great Cressingham,
    was one of the manors which belonged to Judge Paston. In 1451,
    Blomefield tells us that Walter Paston, clerk, gave it to his
    brother John. In the reign of Henry VIII. Sir William Paston sold
    it to Dame Elizabeth Fitzwilliams.--Blomefield, vi. 99.]

    [Footnote 245-1: [From Fenn, ii. 186.] This letter is not
    addressed, but must have been intended for the writer's brother
    John, or else, as Fenn suggests, for his mother, Margaret. Sir
    John, however, ends by saying, 'Within four days I hope to see
    you'; and it appears by next letter that he was actually with his
    brother at Norwich within _three_ days, whereas he paid no visit
    to his mother, who seems to have been living, as she had done for
    some time, at Mautby. This letter must have been written from

    [Footnote 246-1: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] This letter is shown by
    internal evidence to have been written shortly after the Duke of
    Norfolk's death, which, as we have seen, took place on the 17th
    January 1476. It was written on a Sunday, and states that Sir John
    Paston had left Norwich the day before. The letter following,
    which is of the 23rd January, is dated by John Paston, 'Tuesday
    next after your (Sir John's) departing,' so that the Sunday on
    which this was written must certainly have been the 21st.]

I recomaunde me to yow, letyng yow weete that I was infformyd by Ric.

JOHN PASTON TO LORD HASTINGS[253-1]

_To my Lord._

[Sidenote: 1476 / MARCH 2]

My most doughtyd and singular good lord, aftyr most humble and dew
recomendacyon, please it your good lordshepp to have knowlage that,
accordyng to your comandement, in my wey homeward, I remembred me of a
persone whyche to my thynkyng is meetly to be clerk of your kechyn,
whyche persone is now in servyse with Master Fitzwater, and was befor
that with Whethyll at Gwynes, and purveyor for hys house, and at syche
tyme as the Kynges grace was ther last in hys vyage towardes France.
Thys man is meane of stature, yonge inough, well wittyd, well manerd, a
goodly yong man on horse and foote. He is well spokyn in Inglyshe, metly
well in Frenshe, and verry perfite in Flemyshe. He can wryght and reed.
Hys name is Rychard Stratton; hys modyr is Mastress Grame of Caleys. And
when I had shewyd hym myn intent, he was agreable and verry glad if that
it myght please your lordshepp to accept hym in to your servyse; wherto
I promysed hym my poore helpe, as ferforthe as I durst meve your good
lordshepp for hym, trustyng that I shold have knowelage of your plesure
her in, or I departed towardes your lordshep ought of this contrey.
Wherfor I advysed hym to be redy with in xiiij. dayes of Marche at the
ferthest, that if it pleasyd your lordsheppe to accept hym or to have a
syght of hym be for your departyng to Caleys, that ther shold be no
slaughthe in hym.

He desyred me to meve Master Fitzwater to be good mastyr to hym in thys
behalve, and so I dyd; and he was verry glad and agreable ther to,
seying if hys sone had ben of age, and all the servauntis he hathe myght
be in eny wyse acceptabell to your lordshepp, that they all, and hym
silff in lyek wyse, shall be at your comandment, whyll he leveth.

And at my comyng home to my poore house, I sent for Robart Bernard, and
shewid on to hym that I had mevyd your lordshepp for hym; and he in lyek
forme is agreable to be redy by the xiiij. day of Marche to awayte on
your lordshepp, be it to Caleys or ellys where, and fro that day so
foorthe for ever, whyll hys lyff wyll last, with ought grugeing or
contraying your comandement and plesure, in eny wyse that is in hym
possibyll t'accomplishe.

I shewed on to hym that I had preyed Master Talbot to be a mean to your
good lordshepp for hym, and if so wer that Mastyr Talbot thought that
your lordshepp wer content to take hys servyse, then that it wold please
Mr. Talbot to meve my Lady of Norffolkes grace to wryght or send to
Bernard, puttyng hym in knowlage that hyr grace is content that he shall
become your menyall servaunt. Wherof he was passyng well pleasyd; but,
that notwithstandyng, as I enformed your lordshepp, he is not so
reteyned, neyther by fee nor promess, but that he may let hym sylff
loose to do your lordsheppe servyse when ye wyll receyve hym, and so
wyll he do; but, your lordshepe so pleasid, leve wer bettyr. Rychard
Stratton told me that whyll he was in servyse with Whethyll, John Redwe
mocyond hym onys myche aftyr thys intent, but at that tyme Whethyll wold
not be so good mastyr to hym as to meve your lordshepe for hym.

My lord, I trust that your lordshepe shall lyek bothe ther persones and
ther condicyons; and as for ther trowthes, if it may please your good
lordshepe to accept my poore woord with thers, I wyll depose largely for
that. And as it pleasyth your good lordshepe to comand me in thes
maters, and all other, if it may please your lordshepe to shewe the same
to my brodyr Nessfeld, he knowith who shall sonest be with me to putt me
in knowlage of your plesure, whyche I shall be at all seasons redy
t'accomplyshe to my poore power, with Godes grace, Whom I beseche longe
to contenue the prosperous astate of your good lordshepp.

Fro Norwyche, the seconde daye of Marche, with the hand of your most
humble servaunt and beedman,

  JOHN PASTON.

wyll do for me, with Godes grace, Whom I beseche to send yow the

SIR JOHN PASTON TO MARGARET PASTON[262-1]

_To Mestresse Margret Paston._

[Sidenote: 1476 / [AUG. 30]]

Please it yow to wete that I was uppon Tywesdaye, the daye that I
departyd froo yowe, with my brother John at Atelborow by viij. of the
clokke at evyn, and founde hym in suche case as iff ye had seyn hym than
ye wolde have be as gladde of hym osse off a nywe sone. I wenyd nott
that he sholde nott have levyd tyll the mornyng; in so moche that by my
trowthe I dare seye that iff it had nott fortunyd us to have comyn to
hym, he had not been on lyve on Wednysdaye. For syns Saterday slepyd he
nott iiij. howris, and yitt iij. of them was syns I come thydyr, on to
thys nyght; and thys nyght, blessyd be God, he hathe slepyd well, and
with Goddys grace I dowte not but thatt he shall do weell. For his agywe
is goone, and alle that laye in hys stomak and undre hys syde it weryth
aweye, and within a daye or ij. I hope he shall be so stronge that I
maye come frome hym; and he hopyth to see yowe with in fewe days affter,
as he seyth. On Wednysdaye I wysshed to hym that he and I hadde been at
Norwyche; wheruppon he harpyd all that nyght, and for cawe (_sic_) he
hadde not so goode rest as he wolde, it fylle in hys brayne to come to
Norwyche; and he in an angyr wolde nedys to horse. He wolde non horsse
litter, he was so stronge. Neverthelesse we wenyd nott that he sholde
have been able to have redyn a myle, and wenyd that it had nott been
possible to have passid Wyndham; bott whan he was uppe for that, we
seyde he roode so welle he ledde uss a dawnce faster than alle we cowde
weell folowe. He was at Wyndham, by my trowthe, in lesse than an howr by
a large quarter, and ther restyd hym an howre, and to horse ageyne and
was heer in lesse than an howr and one halffe. And now he dowteth nott
to slepe weell, for he seyth that he never ffaylyd to slepe weel in that
bedde that he hathe chosyn now at Frenshys, and thusse I hope he be
sauffe. And I am in dowte whethyr I shall within ij. dayes owther come
home to yow or ellis to goo forthe as ye woote off. No moore, &c. Wretyn
on Frydaye next the Decollacion of Seynt John Baptyst.

Item, I have the wrythynges off Richard Calle.

  Your sone,

  J. PASTON, K.

    [Footnote 262-1: [Add. MS. 34,889, f. 188.] Strangely enough there
    is no mention elsewhere of the serious illness of young John
    Paston mentioned in this letter, by which we might fix the year
    when it was written. But perhaps we may surmise that it was 1476,
    after he had been at Calais, where he was expected in the spring.
    The fact that he was ill at Attleborough agrees with this
    supposition, for that was the seat of the Fitzwalter family, and
    'Master Fitzwalter' is mentioned in No. 888 as at Calais showing
    much interest in the Paston family. It may be observed also that
    in 1476, Friday 'next' the Decollation of St. John Baptist (29th
    August) would be the very next day.]

_To my wurschypfull cosyn, John Paston, be thys bill delyvered, &c._

[Sidenote: 1476 or 1477]

Ryght wurschypfull cosyn, I recommande me un to yowe, thankyng zowe
hertely for the grette chere that ze made me the last tyme that ze were
with me at Norwych, &c.

And, cosyn, as for the mater that was put in my nowncle Hastynges and
Henry Heydon, I ondyrstand be myn uncle, that ther was made non ende
therin, whech I am ryght sory for. Cosyn, ze be remembred what ze
promysed me that, and so were that myn uncle and Herry Heydon made none
ende therin, that ze wold put the mater in me; and if it please zowe so
for to do, in good faith, cosyn, I schall goo as wele and as ryghtfully

And Almyghty Jesus hafe zowe in kepyng, &c.

  Be zour cosyn,

  Dame ELIZABETH BREWS.

    [Footnote 264-1: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] This is the first of a
    series of letters, some of which were certainly written in
    February 1477, relating to the engagement of John Paston to
    Margery Brews. How early they began it is not easy to say
    precisely. On the back of this letter is written, apparently in
    the hand of John Paston, to whom it is addressed, 'Letrae dominae
    Elyzabethae Brews et Margariae filae (_sic_) ejus.']

xx_li._ in to zowr handes, and then he wolde be more gladd to marye with

maryed, my fadur will gyffe hyr l. merk. But and we acorde, I schall
gyffe yowe a grettere tresur, that is, a wytty gentylwoman, and if I sey

    [Footnote 266-1: [From Fenn, ii. 208.] It is clear from internal
    evidence that this letter was written between the 7th and the 12th
    of February, and the fact that St. Valentine's Day (the 14th) fell
    on Friday, proves the year to have been 1477. Besides which, we
    have distinct references to the matter further on in the dated
    correspondence.]

please yt yow to wett, that the cause that Dame Elizabeth Brews desyreth
to mete with yow at Norwyche, and not at Langley, as I apoyntyd with yow
at my last being at Mawtby, is by my meanys, for my brodyr Thomas
Jermyn, whyche knowyth nought of the mate [_match_], telyth me, that the
causey or ye can comme to Bokenham Fery is so over flowyn that ther is
no man that may on ethe passe it, though he be ryght well horsyd; whyche
is no mete wey for yow to passe over, God defend it. But, all thyngs
rekynyd, it shalbe lesse cost to yow to be at Norwyche, as for a day or
tweyn, and passe not, then to mete at Langly, wher every thyng is dere;
and your horse may be sent home ayen the same Wednysday.

Modyr, I beseche yow for dyvers causys, that my syster Anne may come
with yow to Norwyche; modyr, the mater is in a resonable good wey, and I
trust with Gods mercy, and with your good help, that it shall take
effect bettyr to myn avauntage then I told yow of at Mawtby; for I trow
ther is not a kynder woman leveing then I shall have to my modyr in
lawe, if the mater take, nor yet a kynder fadyr in lawe then I shall
have, though be he hard to me as yett. All the cyrcumstancys of the
mater, whyche I trust to tell yow at your comyng to Norwyche, cowd not
be wretyn in iij. levys of paper, and ye know my lewd hed well i nough,
I may not wryght longe, wherffor I ffery over all thyngs tyll I may

Dame Elizabeth Brewse shall lye at Jon Cookys; if it myght please yow,
I wold be glad that she myght dyne in your howse on Thursday, for ther
shold ye have most secret talkyng. And modyr, at the reverence of God,
beware that ye be so purveyd for, that ye take no cold by the wey
towards Norwyche, for it is the most peraylous marche that ever was seyn
by eny manys dayes that now lyveth; and I prey to Jesu preserve yow and

_Thys bylle be delyverd to Thomas Grene, good man of the George, by

[Sidenote: 1477 / MARCH 9]

Ryght worchepfull sir, and my most good and kynde brodyr, in as humbyll
wyse as I can, I recomand me to yow. Sir, it is so that I have, sythe
John Bekurton departyd fro hens, ben at Toppcrofft at Syr Tohmas Brewse;
and as for the mater that I sent yow word of by Jon Bekurton, towchyng
my sylff and Mastress Margery Brews, I am yet at no serteynte, hyr fadyr
is so hard; but I trow I have the good wyll of my lady hyr modyr and
hyr; but as the mater provyth, I shall send yow woord, with Godes grace,
in short tyme.

But as for John Bekurton, I prey yow dele with hym for suerte as a
soudyor shold be delt with; trust hym never the more for the bylle that
I sent yow by hym, but as a man at wylde, for every thyng that he told
me is not trewe; for he departyd with ought lycence of hys mastyr, Syr
Thomas Brewse, and is fere endangeryd [_indebted_] to dyvers in thys
contrey. I prey God that I wryght not to yow of hym to late; but for all
thys I knowe none untrowthe in hym; but yet I prey yow, trust hym not
over myche upon my woord.

Syr, Perse Mody[275-1] recomandyth hym to your mastyrshep, and besecheth
yow to send hym word in hast, hough he shall be demeanyd at your place
at Caster; for he is asygnyd to no body as yet, to take of mete and
drynk, nor yet wher that he shall have money to paye for hys mete and
drynk; and now is the cheff replenysheing of your warenn there, the
avauntage of the dove howse wer well for hym, tyll ye come hom your

Sir, I prey yow pardon me of my wryghtyng, hough so ever it be, for

JOHN PYMPE TO SIR JOHN PASTON[276-2]

_To Master Sir John Paston, be this letter delyverid in Calis._

[Sidenote: 1477 / [MARCH]]

Honwre and joye be to yow, my ryght gode master, and most assured
brother; letyng yow know that al yowre welwillers and servaunts, in
these partyes, that I know, fare well, and better wold, if they mowht
here of yowre wellbeyng, and forthwith sum of yowre Frenche and Borgoyne
tidyngs; ffor we in these partyes be in grete drede lest the French Kyng
with sum assaults shuld in eny wise distourbe yow of yowr soft, sote
[_sweet_], and sewre slepys, but as yet we no thyng can here that he so
disposeth hym.

Mary, we have herd sey, that the frowys[277-1] of Broggys, with there
hye cappes, have gyven sum of yow grete clappys, and that the fete of
her armys doyng is such, that they smyte al at the mowthe, and at the
grete ende of the thyeh; but in faith we care not for yow, for we know
well that ye be gode ynowh at defence. But we here sey, that they be of
such corage, that they gyve yow moo strokys than ye do to them, and that
they strike sorer than ye also. But I thynk that the English ladyes and
jentylwomen, and the pore also, can do as well as they, and lyst not to
lerne of them no thyng; and therefor we drede lest ther hye corages
shuld meve them to make yow warre also. But God defend, for by my trowth
than have ye much to do; for hit were better and more ese for to labor
iij. or fowre dayes with mattokks and pykeisys to over turne yowr sande
hills, as we here saye ye do ryht wurshipfully, than only one day to
endure theyre fers encountrys; so as ye myht owther gete or save yowr
wurshippys by; and loke that ye trust to have no rescow of us, for, so
God me helpe, we have y nowh to do in these partyes with the same werrs.
But in one thyng we preyse yowre sadnessys and discrecionys ryht much,
that is, in kepyng of yowr trewse and pese with the Kyng of Fraunce, as
the Kyng hath commaundid; and a grete reson why, for hit were to much
for yow to have werre with all the world at onys, ffor the werre a fore
seid kepith yow blameles; ffor every resonable man wetyth well, that hit
is to much for eny pepyll levyng to do bothe at onys.

Syr, as for the more parts off my thowht, I praye yow recomaunde me un
to yowr self, prayyng yow that y may contynew in such case as yowr
godenes hath taken me of old, and if ye lyst to send eny tydyngs, or
other thyng to the partyes that were wont to warme theym by yowr fyre,
in feith I shall do yowr erand.

And as for barley, hit is of the same pryce that hit was wont to be of,
and is the most sure corne, and best enduryng that may be. And, syr,
where that sumtyme was a lytyll hole in a wall, is now a dore large
ynowh and esy passage, whereof ye were the deviser, and have thank for
yowr labor of sum partyes, but no thyng lastyth evyr. Y mene that y
trow, my passage shall hastyly faile me, and the dore shalbe shet up
agayne, lesse than Fortun be agreable to have my counseile kept; for not
long ago, makyng my entre at that passage, I saw a sparow that useth
those ewrys [_eireys_], and I saw her sytt so stille that y cowde not
endure, but y must neds shote her, and so, God me help, I smote her,
I trow evyn to the hert; and so I drede me lest owther the barley wyll
ete the sparow, or ells the sparow wyll ete the barley, but as yet all
is well, but reson shewt me that hit must neds fayle by contynewauns,
lesse than I forsake bothe the sparow and the barley also.[278-1]

Syr, I have thank for the shew that I onys made of yow and daily
gramercy, and ye theire prayer.

Syr, forthemore I beseche yow, as ye wyll do eny thyng for me, that ye
se o day for my sake, and for yowr own plesure, all the gode hors in
Caleys, and if ther be among theym eny pric[278-2] horse of deds, that
is to sell, in especiall that he be well trottyng of his owne corage,
with owte fors[278-3] of sporis, and also a steryng [_stirring_] hors if
he be, he is the better; I pray yow send me word of his color, deds, and
corage, and also of his price, feynyng as ye wold by hym yowrself, and
also I wold have hym sumwhat large, not with the largest; but no smalle
hors, as more than a dowble hors; prayyng yow above all thyngs to have
this in remembrauns, and that hastily as may be, for ther is late
promysed me help to such an entent, and I wote not how long hit shall
endure; and therfor I beseche yow send me word by tyme.

I trow the Frenshe men have taken up al the gode hors in Pycardye, and
also they be wont to be hevy hors in labor, and that I love not, but a
hevy hors of flesh, and lyht of corage y love well, for y love no hors
that wyll al way be lene and slender like grehounds. God kepe yow.

  Yowr,

  J. PYMPE.

Y pray yow to recomaund me to my cosyn Sir John Scot and all his, in
especiall Mastres Benyngfeld.[279-1]

JOHN PYMPE TO SIR JOHN PASTON[279-2]

_To Syr John Paston, Knyht, be this delyverid in Calice._

[Sidenote: 1477 / [MARCH?]]

Master Paston, I recommaund me to yow; and by cause that I have wrytyn
to yow iij. long letteres; which as yet be answereles, I wote not
whether that the length of mater acumbred yow, or elles the simpylnes of
the effect displesid yow, or elles that ye have utterly refusid the
proferes of my pore servyce and frendeship; but which of these soo ever
hit be, hit hevyeth me.

Syr, hit nedith not, I trow, to send yow the tidynges of these partyes,
how be hit I have thryes send yow such as here were, in entent that ye
shuld send us of yowres; but as long as my lord and yowres is there, ye
can not faile to have the certeynte of all owre English aventures, which
is grete ese to yowr frendes and servauntes in this contre, for so much
as they may make her letteres shorter by so much.

Syr, at the wrytyng of this letter, I was in Kent, where all thyng that
I rejoisid, I wishid yow part of, or all; and as for myself, I am styll
yowr servaunt and bedeman, and so am bownd to be so sore and sewrely,
that I can not unbynde me.

Syr, this is the v. letter that I have sent yow, whereyn thys entent
that folowyth was all wayes on, that is to say, that hit plesid yow sum
on day to take so much labour for me for to se the jentyllest hors in
Calice that is to be sold, and to lett me know of his colowre, dedes,
and price, remembryng that he be also large as mesure wyll, for I love
no small hors, nor hors that wyll evyr be lene and slendyr; but I wold
have hym hye truttyng, if hit wylbe, and if he be styryng with all, he
shall plese me the better, for I wuld have hym all for the plesur, and
for the werre, but if he myht be for bothe. Veryly ther is no tidynges
on that side the se, safe only the welfare of yow and all other there,
that I wuld so fayne here of as of a jentyll trottyng hors that were
lyght and pleasaunt in dedes, if eny such be there. Flemysh hors I thenk
ye have y nowh that wyll play for a myle or ij., but such we have here
also; how be hit I pray yow send me word of yowre store, and be sewre of
the price, if ye like eny, or elles let sum man for yow.

No more, but God kepe yow, prayyng yow to recommaund me to my cosyn Syr
John Scot, and to Syr Tyry Robsert. Let the letter be sent to the
godewif of yowr loggyng.

  By yowr JOHN PYMPE.

I recomande me to yow, letyng yow weete that I receyvyd a letter of
yowres by Edward Hensted ij. dayes aftre that Whetley was departyd from

sholde have sent yow answer by Whetley, iff I had hadde it toffore he
wente, notwithstandyng I am ryght lothe to wryghte in that mater offte;
for for a conclusion I wrote to my moodre by Peerse Moody alle that I
myght and wolde doo ther in. Ye have also nowe wretyn ageyn. Yow neede

Item, wher ye thynke that I may with concience recompence it ageyn on to
owr stokke off other londys that I have off that valywe in fee symple,
it is so that Snaylwell, by my grauntefadres will ones, and by my fadris
will sceconderely, is entaylyd to the issyw of my fadres body.

Item, as for Sporle xx_li._ by yeer, I hadde ther off butt xx. marke by
yere, whyche xx. marke by yeer and the x. marke ovyr, I have endangeryd,
as ye weell knowe off that bargayne, whyche, iff itt be nott redemyd,
I most recompence some other maner off myne to one off my bretheryn for
the seyde x. marke, ovyr xx. marke that longyth to me; wherffor I kepe

whyche is nott to the valywe off the maner off Sparham. And as for
Castre, it weer noo convenyent londe to exchange for suche a thyng, nor
it weer not polesy for me to sett that maner in suche case for alle

to opteyne thynge that alle yowr freendys may nott ease yow off; for if
my moodre were dysposyd to gyve me and any woman in Ingelande the best

Stablysshe your selffe uppon a goode grownde, and grace shall folowe.
Yowr mater is ferre spoken off, and blowyn wyde, and iff it preve noo

me that I am so onkynde that I lett alle togedre. I thynke notte a mater
happy, nor weell handelyd, nor poletykly dalte with, when it can never
be fynysshyd with owte an inconvenyence; and to any suche bargayne I
kepe never to be condescentyng, ner of cowncell. Iffe I weer att the

effecte; wheroff I wolde be as gladde as any man; and ame better content
nowe, that he sholde have hyr, than any other, that evyr he was
hertoffoor abowte to have hadde, consyderyd hyr persone, her yowthe, and
the stok that she is comyn offe, the love on bothe sydes, the tendre
ffavor that she is in with hyr ffader and mooder, the kyndenesse off hyr
ffadr and moodr to hyr in departyng with hyr, the ffavor also, and goode
conceyte that they have in my brother, the worshypfull and vertuous
dysposicion off hyr ffadr and moodr, whyche pronostikyth that, of
lyklihod, the mayde sholde be vertuous and goode; all which concyderyd,
and the necessary relyffe that my brother most have, I mervayle the
lesse, that ye have departyd, and gevyn hym the maner off Sperham, in
such fforme as I have knowleche off by W. Gornay, Lomner, and Skypwyth;
and I ame ryght gladde to se in yow suche kyndenesse on to my brother as
ye have doon to hym; and wolde by my trowthe lever than C_li._ that it
weer ffee symple londe, as it is entaylyd, whyche by liklyhood scholde
prosper with hym and hys blode the better in tyme to come, and sholde
also never cause debate in owr bloode in tyme to come, whyche Godde
dyffende, ffor that weer onnaturell.

Item, another inconvenyence is, wher as I undrestande that the maner is
gevyn to my brother, and to hys wyff, and to the issywe bytwen them
bygoten; iff the case weer soo, that he and she hadde yssywe togedr a
dowtr or moo, and hys wyffe dyed, and he maried afftr another, and hadde
issywe a sone, that sone sholde have noon londe, and he beyng hys
ffadres heyr, and ffor th'enconvenyence that I have knowe let in
ur[286-1] in case lyke, and yit enduryth in Kente, by tweyn a jentylman
and his suster, I wolde ye toke the advyce off yowr concell in thys
poynt, and that that is past yow by wrightyng or by promise, I deme
verrely in yow, that ye dyd it off kyndenesse, and in eschywyng off a
moor yll that myght befall.

Item, wher as it pleasyth yow that I sholde ratefye, grawnt, or conferme
the seyd gyfte on to my brother, it is so, that with myn honeste I may
nott, and ffor other cawses. The Pope will suffre a thyng to be usyd,
but he will nott lycence nor grant it to be usyd nor don, and soo I. My
brother John knowyth myn entent weel i now heer to ffoor in this mater;
I will be ffownde to hym as kynde a brother as I may be.

Item, iff it be soo that Sir T. Brews and hys wyff thynke that I wolde
troble my brother and hys wyff in the seid maner, I can ffynde no meene
to putte them in sywerte ther off, but iff it neede, to be bownde in an
obligacion with a condicion that I shalle nott trowble ner infete them
therin.

Item, I thynke that she is made sywer i now in astate in the londe, and
that off ryght I deme they shall make noone obstacles at my wryghtyng,
ffor I hadde never none astate in the londe, ner I wolde nott that I had
hadde.

No mor to yow at thys tyme, but Allmyghty God have yow in kepyng.

[_Margaret Paston to Dame Elyzabeth Brews._]

'Ryght worchepfull and my verry good lady and cosyn, as hertly as I can,
I recomand me to yow. And, madam, I am ryght sory, if it myght be
otherwyse, of the dysease, as I undyrstand by the berer herof, that my
cosyn your husbond and ye also have had a season, whyche I prey God
soone to redresse to your bothe easeis. And, madam, I thank yow hertly
that ye have remembred the mater to my cosyn your husbond, that I spak

fortunate then he is in that mater; for, as I undyrstand by your lettyr,
my cosyn your husbond wyll geve but an C_li._, whyche is no money lyek
for syche a joyntore as is desyred of my son, thow hys possybylyte wer
ryght easy. But, madam, when I mad that large grant in the maner of
Sperham that I have mad to hym and my cosyn your doughter, he told me of
an other some that he shold have with hyr then of an C_li._ He hathe
befor thys be wont to tell me none untrowthe; and what I shall deme in
thys mater, I can not sey, for me thynkyth if more then an C_li._ wer
promysyd on to hym by my cosyn your husbond and yow, that ye wold not
lett to geve it hym, with ought so wer that I or he abryggyd eny thyng
of our promess, whyche I wot well neyther I or he intend to do, if I may
undyrstand that hys seying to me was trowthe, and that it may be
performyd; but wyst I that he told me otherwyse then my cosyn yowr
husbond and ye promysed hym, to deseyve me of Sparham, by my trowthe,
thow he have it, he shall lese as myche for it, iff I leve, and that
shall he well undyrstand the next tyme I se hym.

'And, madam, I pray God send us good of thys mater, for as for hys
broder Sir John also, I sent ones to hym for it to have mad good the
same graunt that I grauntyd yow with hys assent, to them and to ther
issu of ther ij. bodyes lawfully comyng, and he dyd not ther in as I
desyred hym. And ther for I prey yow pardon me for sendyng on to hym eny
more; for, madam, he is my sone, and I can not fynd in my hert to becom
a dayly petycyoner of hys, sythe he hathe denyed me onys myn axing.
Peraventure he had ben better to have performyd my desyer; and what hys
answer was on to me, John Paston can tell yow as well as I. But, madam,
ye ar a moder as well as I, wher I prey tak it non other wyse bot well,
that I may not do by John Paston, as ye wyll have me to do; for, madam,
thow I wold he dyd well, I have to purvey for more of my chylder then
hym, of whyche some be of that age, that they can tell me well inow that
I dele not evenly with theym to geve John Paston so large, and theym so
lytyll; and, madam, for syche grwgys and other causys, I am ryght sory
that the graunte is knowyn that I have mad, with ought it myght take
effect. And therfor, madam, fro hensforthe I remyght all thyng to yowr
dyscressyon, besechyng yow, the rather for my sake, to be my son Johnis

hors than he nedyth; and he answered me, that he wold selle hym with
good will, but ther shuld no man bie hym under x_li._ Flemesch;[296-2]
and I offered hym in your name, x. marke, for he wold not here of none
other ambelyng horse, that ye myght geve hym therfore. And also my lord
dissired to have bowte hym for the Lord Schauntrell that is cheff
capteyn of Seynt Omers; and he wold no lesse lete my lord have hym than
x_li._ and so my lord bowte another, and gave hym the seide lord, for he
thoughte this to dere; neverthelesse he wol not selle hym to no man
under that mony, that he sette hym on, and so ye may bye your plesur in
hym and ye lest; for otherwyse he wol not doo for you, as I conseve.

And as for tydyngs in theyse partyes, the Frenche Keng leyzth at sege at
Seynt Omers, on the one side of the town a myle of, but he hath no gret
ordenaunce ther; and they of the town skyrmysh with them every day, and
kepe a passage halff a myle with oute the town; and the French Keng hath
brenned all the townys, and fayre abbeys, that were that way aboute
Seynt Omers, and also the cornes weche ar there. And also, as yt ys
seide for serteyn, the French Keng hath brenned Cassell, that ys myn
hoold Lady of Burgeynys[297-1] joynttor, and all the countre there
aboute, whereby she hath lost a gret part of her lyvelod; and that is a
sherewed tokyn that he menyth wel to the Keng, howur suffereygn Lord,
when he intendyth to distroye her.

Morover Sir Phylep de Crevekere hath takyn them that were in Fynys with
inne this iiij. dayes to the noumbre of xiiij. personys, and the
remnaunt where fled, and he had them to the French Keng, and he hath
brentte all the place, and pulled down the towre, and a part of the
wall, and disstroyed yt.

And as yt is seid, yf the French Keng can not gete Seynt Omers, that he
intendyth to brenge his armye thorwe theyse marchys into Flaundres;
wherefore my lord hath do brokyn all the passages excep Newham bryge,
weche is wached, and the turne pyke shette every nyght. And the seide
French Keng with inne these iij. dayes rayled gretely of my lord to
Tygyr Pursevaunt, opynly byfore ij. hundred of his folks; wherefore yt
ys thaught here that he wold feynde a quarell to sett upon thys town, yf
he myght gete avantage. And as I understonde, the Emperorys sone[297-2]
ys maryed at Gaunte as this day; and ther cam with hym but iiij. hundred
horse, and I can here of no moo that be comyng in serteyn; and in mony
he brengyth with hym an hundred thowsand dokets, wheche is but a smalle
thyng in regard for that he hath to doo. Wherefore, I fere me sore, that
Flaundres will be lost; and yf Seynt Omers be whonnyn, all is gon, in my
conceyt. Never the lesse they say there shuld come gret powere after the
Emperorys son; but I be leve yt not, by cause they have ben so long of
comyng.

And I pray you to recomaunde me unto Sir Tyrry Robsert, and that yt
plese you to lete hym knowe of your tydyngs, and Hour Lord have you in
His kepyng.

At Calais, the Sunday next after Hour Lady the Assumpsion.

[Sidenote: 1477 / NOV. 19]

Ryth worchepful sir, I recomand me to yowr good masterchep. Plseyth you
to wete that I have purweyid for for your heryng a non after your

more come on the se with his good wylle. Ther is no man wyllyng to del
with your swanes. Also, as for your hors, ye most ordayne a nothir keper
than they have, or ellis ye chal not leke wel be them whan ye se hem;
they arn nowthir redyn nor corayd. Peris is meche owteward, and Whyte
wol not a tende hem, nowdyr for Peris ner for me. They arn not watryd
butt at the welle. Peris hath be ryth seke; and yet, but for dyspleser
of you, Peris had ben in hand with Whyte or this tyme. Ye muste be
proveyd of a nothir hors keper, or elles it wol do you harm on your

hath sen down hyr men, and with set alle the stuff and wrekke, and seyth
that ye gete non there, for sche wol have it be the tytyl of the lete,
and I have answerd there to, that che owte non to have be that tytil;
and so if ye wol comon with yor cownsel, I trow it to the lord of the
soylle and not to the lete; for the maner holdyth nothyng of hyr. Sche
had never no wrekke nor growndage till withinne this xx. wynter. There
is no maner in Wyynterton but your; lesse your ryth now and lesse it for
ever. I am threte to be trobelid there, for there ben v. men on lyve of

that I receyvyd your leter, but he hath ij. men of Norwech to sewirte to

plomer is a nothir that chal bere the dawnger. And as for your swanes,
I have gette a man that chal cary hem be lond, and that I chal send word
with the swanes that the herynges chal com be water; and if the chuld

Item, there arn wyndownes blow opyn in the place, and the wyndown of the

MARGERY PASTON TO JOHN PASTON[307-1]

_To my ryth reverent and worscheful husbond, Jon Paston._

[Sidenote: 1477 / DEC. 18]

Ryth reverent and worscheful husbond, I recomaunde me to yow, desyryng
hertyly to here of yowr wylfare, thankyng yow for the tokyn that ye sent
me be Edmunde Perys, preyng yow to wete that my modyr sent to my fadyr
to London for a goune cloth of mustyrddevyllers[307-2] to make of a
goune for me; and he tolde my modyr and me wanne he was comme home, that
he cargeyt yow to beyit, aftyr that he were come oute of London.

I pre yow, yf it be not bowt, that ye wyl wechesaf to byit, and sendyt
home as sone as ye may, for I have no goune to weyre this wyntyr but my
blake and my grene a lyer,[307-3] and that is so comerus that I ham wery
to weryt.

As for the gyrdyl that my fadyr be hestyt me, I spake to hym ther of a
lytyl before he zede to London last, and he seyde to me that the faute
was in yow, that ze wolde not thynk ther uppe on to do makyt [_to get it
made_]; but I sopose that ys not so; he seydyt but for a skwsacion.
I pre yow, yf ye dor takyt uppe on yow, that ye wyl weche safe to do
makyt a yens ye come home, for I hadde never more nede ther of than I
have now, for I ham waxse so fetys[308-1] that I may not be gyrte in no
barre of no gyrdyl that I have but of one. Elisabet Peverel hath leye
sek xv. or xvj. wekys of the seyetyka, but sche sent my modyr word be

    [Footnote 307-1: [From Fenn, ii. 256.] It is curious that after
    so much negotiation for the marriage of John Paston and Margery
    Brews, we have no record in these letters when it actually took
    place; but probably it was in August 1477, the last reference to
    it as an event not yet accomplished being on the 7th of that
    month (No. 916). In January 1478, John Paston talks of taking
    his wife to her father's house on account of her situation, and
    their first child was born in the course of the following
    summer. This letter seems to have been written in December. Fenn
    remarks that St. Thomas's Day might mean the Translation of St.
    Thomas a Becket, 7th July 1478, and 'Our Lady's Day' might be
    the Visitation of the Virgin, 2nd July preceding. But this is
    simply impossible, because the letter is dated Thursday
    _before_ St. Thomas's Day, which would in that case be the
    very same date as the Visitation of Our Lady, viz. the 2nd July
    1478. Besides, if the first child of John Paston and Margery was
    not actually born before July, the latter was certainly much
    nearer to her confinement then than this letter would imply.
    _See_ No. 936 in vol. vi.

    A facsimile of this letter was published in the _European
    Magazine_ for March 1787, and we have carefully compared the
    text with this facsimile.]

JOHN PASTON TO SIR JOHN PASTON[309-2]

_To my ryght worchepfull broder, Syr John Paston, Knyght._

[Sidenote: 1478 / JAN. 21]

Syr, aftyr all dutes of recomendacyon, lyeketh yow to undyrstand that I
have comond with dyvers folkys of the Dwk of Suffolk now thys Crystmas
and sythen, whyche let me in secret wyse have knowlage, lyek as I wrott
on to yow, that he must mak a shefft for money, and that in all hast.
Wherfor, syr, at the reverence of God, let it not be lachesyd, but with
effect aplyed now, whyll he is in London, and my lady hys wyff also; for
I assarteyn yow that C. mark wyll do more now in ther neede then ye
shall peraventure do with CC. marks in tyme comyng, and thys season be
not takyn. And alweys fynd the meane that my Lady of Suffolk and Syr R.
Chamberleyn may be yowr gwydes in thys mater, for as for my lord, he
nedyth not to be mevyd with it tyll it shold be as good as redy to the
sealyng.

Syr, lyeketh yow also to remember that I told yow that Mastyr
Yotton[309-3] had, as I cam last towardes London, desyred me, by a
lettre of attorney wryttyn with hys owne hand, to se th'enprowment of
syche profytes as ar growing of hys chapell in Caster that ye gave hym;
and at syche season as I told yow of it, ye sayd on to me that ye wold
asay to make a bargayn with hym, so that ye myght have a prest to syng
in Caster. Syr, me thynkes ye can not have so good a season to meve hym
with it as now thys Parlement tyme, for now I thynk he shalbe awaytyng
on the Quene; and also if ye myght compone with hym or he wyst what the
valew wer, it wer the better, and I have promysed hym to send hym woord
thys terme of the verry valew of it, and also syche mony as I cowd gader
of it. Wherfor, syr, I prey yow that by the next messenger that ye can
get to Pekok that ye wyll send hym woord to paye me for the lond in xxx.
acres, as it hathe ben answerd before tym.

And as for tydynges here, we have none, but we wold fayne here of all
your royalte at London, as of the maryage of my Lord of York,[310-1] and
other Parlement mater; and so I prey yow that I may doo when ye have
leyser.

Syr, I prey yow that Whetley may have knowlage that my broder Yelverton
hathe promysed me to take hym xl_d._; he owyth me by reason of his
fermore at Caster more then that.

And, syr, as for my huswyff, I am fayne to carry hyr to se hyr fadyr and
hyr frendes now thys wynter, for I trow she wyll be ought of facyon in
somer. And so in my progresse fro my fadyr Brews on to Mawtby, I took
Master Playter in my wey, at whoys hows I wrot thys bylle, the xxj. day
of January, anno E. iiij^ti xvij^{o}. And I beseche God to preserve yow
and yours.

  Yowr,

JOHN PASTON TO MARGARET PASTON[311-1]

_To my ryght worchepfull modyr, Margaret Paston._

[Sidenote: 1478 / FEB. 3]

Ryght worchepfull modyr, aftyr all dwtes of humble recomendacyon, in as
humble wyse as I can, I beseche yow of your dayly blyssyng. Pleasyt yow
to wett that at my being now at London, lyek as ye gave me in
comandment, I mevyd to Mastyr Pykenham and to Jamys Hubart for ther
being at Norwyche now thys Lent, that ye myght have ther avyses in syche
maters as ye let me have understandyng of. And as for Mastyr Pykenham,
he is now Juge of the Archys, and also he hathe an other offyce, whyche
is callyd _Auditor Causarum_, and hys besyness is so gret in bothe thes
offyces that he can not tell the season when that he shall have leyser
to come in to Norffolk. But I left not tyll I had gotyn Jamys Hubbart
and hym togedyrs, and then I told theym your intent; and then Mastyr
Pykenham told Jamys and me hys intent, and he preyed Jamys that he shold
in no wyse fayle to be with yow thys Lent. Not withstandyng it was no
grete nede to prey hym myche; for he told Doctore Pykenham that there
was no gentyl woman in Inglond of so lytyll aqueyntance as he had with
yow, that he wold be glader to be servyse on to; and myche the glader,
for he purposeth fro hensforthe duryng hys lyff to be a Norffolk man,
and to lye with in ii. myle of Loddon, whyche is but viij. or x. myle at
the most fro Mautby. And in conclusyon he hathe appoyntyd to awayte on
yow at Norwyche the weeke nexte aftyr Mydlent Sonday, all the hole weke,
if nede be, all other maters leyd apart.

Also I comend with my brodyr Sir John at London of syche maters as ye
wold have amendyd in the bylle that he sent on to yow, and he stake not
gretly at it.

Also, modyr, I herd whyle I was in London wher was a goodly yong woman
to mary, whyche was doughter to one Seff, a merser, and she shall have
CC_li._ in money to hyr maryage, and xx. mark by yer of lond aftyr the
dyssease of a steppe modyr of hyrs, whyche is upon l. yer of age; and or
I departyd ought of London, I spak with some of the maydys frendys, and
have gotyn ther good wyllys to have hyr maryd to my brodyr Edmund.
Notwithstandyng, those frendys of the maydys that I comond with avysyd
me to get the good wyll of one Sturmyn, whyche is in Mastyr Pykenhamys
danger[312-1] so myche that he is glad to please hym; and so I mevyd
thys mater to Mastyr Pykenham. And incontinent he sent for Sturmyn, and
desyred hys good wyll for my brodyr Edmund, and he grantyd hym hys good
wylle, so that he koud get the good wyll of the remenaunt that wer
executours to Seff, as well as the seyd Sturmyn was; and thusferforthe
is the mater. Wherfor, modyr, we must beseche yow to helpe us forward
with a lettyr fro yow to Mastyr Pykenham to remembyr hym for to handyll
well and dylygently thys mater now thys Lent; and for I am aqueyntyd
with your condycyons of old that ye reke not who endytyth more lettres
than ye, ther for I have drawyn a note to yowr secretarys hand, Freir
Perse, whyche lettre we must prey yow to send us by the berer herof, and
I trust it shall not be longe fro Mastyr Pykenham.

Your doughter of Sweynsthorpp and hyr sojornaunt E. Paston recomandyth
hem to yow in ther most humble wyse, lowly besechyng yow of your
blyssyng; and as for my brodyr, Edmund Sweynsthorpe, for none intrete
that hys ostas your doughtyr, nor I koud intrete hym, myght not kepe
hym, but that he wold have bene at home with you at Mautby on Sonday
last past at nyght; and as he was departyng fro hens, had we word fro
Frenshes wyf that, God yeld yow, modyr, ye had govyn hym leve to
dysporte hym her with us for a vij. or viij. dayes; and so the drevyll
lost hys thank of us, and yet abode nevyr the lesse.

Your doughtyr sendyth yow part of syche poore stuff as I sent hyr fro
London, besechyng yow to take it in gree, though it be lytyll plente
that she sendyth yow. But as for datys, I wyll sey trowthe, ye have not
so many by ij. pownd as wer ment on to yow, for she thynkys at thys
season datys ryght good mete. What so ever it menyth, I prey God send us
good tydynges, Whom I beseche to preserve yow and yours, and so send yow
your myst desyred joye.

At Sweynsthorp, on Ashe Wednysday.

  Your sone and humble servaunt,

  J. PASTON.

Modyr, pleasit yow to remember that ye had need to be at Norwyche v. or
vj. dayes befor that Jamys Hubbart and your consayll shall be ther with
yow, for to look up your evydence and all other thynges redy. Also if ye
thynk that thys bylle that I send yow herwith be good i now to send to
Doctore Pykenham, ye may close up the same, and send it sealyd to me
ayen, and I shall convey it forthe to hym.

    [Footnote 311-1: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] This letter appears from
    the contents to have been written after John Paston's marriage, at
    a time when his wife was staying at Swainsthorpe. He also
    apologises to his mother for his wife having detained two pounds
    out of a certain quantity of dates that he himself had sent to her
    from London by way of Swainsthorpe, as Margery thought them 'at
    this season right good meat,' apparently referring to her
    approaching confinement.]

Plese yor gode masterschyp to wete that I herd thys day how a man wend
that a jugement ys passed ayenst your entent yn the ende of the last
terme (hyt was not of verray certeyn tolde me, but as a dreme) yn the
kynges Chauncerye. I coude gefe none aunswer therto. I prai God alle be
well; hyt wold ease som of your frendes hertys yff they coude understand
ony gode comfort. Sir, as for Robert,[314-1] I wold pray and requyre
your maistershep that he may for his lernyng be abydyng with your cousyn
of Lincoln Inne, as yt was promysed, and to be occupyed under drede of
displesir under subjecion, wyth erly rysyng accustomed, for slouth ys
the moder and norysher of all vices. He hath cost me moch goode and
labour, and now he ys uppon hys makyng by vertues governance, or undoyng
to the contrarye, and yn especyalle to be not conversant ne neere
amongis women, as I was kept froo her [_their_] company xxx. yeres or

me as ye lust, let no name be wythynne wryt whens yt com, and that yt be
sent by sure comer to delyver yt me, for yt ys better brent then founde.
Also your discrecion ought not loth (to take the cost and labour wolle
not be gret, nether importune) for to send a man of purpose to my lord
of [_sic_] Bysshop Waltham and to hys councell lerned, ye wete to whom,
for redy serch to be made for the bill of half lefe of paper quantite of
my hand I faythfully delyvered to Master T. Danvers for to ovyrsee, of
the fyrst appoyntment ye wote off, that ye desyre so hertly to see as of

hym tille he hafe hys entent, for now thys vacacion to spede or nevyr
shall stand in yow no stede. I can no ferther then the walle.

Item, Sir, I comyned wyth Doctor Yotton at Camebrygge late, because
there ys no dyvyne service seyd yn the free chapelle at C.,[314-2] that
he wold hafe a grete concience yn yt, and to depart wyth an honest

uppon me to owen your affeccion to the seyd John Brickys, that he may
wyth more help of your cellary hafe the better to lyve and serfe God
there to abyde and do yow service also. I mene faythfullye, and soo I
pray yow take yt; to remembre a thyng in seson ys gretely to commend,

lawre and asshe, and than to plant yn my tenement at Thyrkbye, or foras

I recomaunde me to yowe, and thanke yow off yowr labor that ye hadde at
Heylesdon and Drayton in seyng the woodys there. And it is soo heer that
Ric. Ferore seyde, that he repentyd hym that evyr he dalte with any
woode theer, and iff I hadde sente hym but the leest chylde that I hadde
to have warnyd hym to leve he wolde notte have dalte therwyth; and he
ffonde noe comfforte in the Chancery, but that he is lyke to contente me
for the harmes and hurte that is doone, and moore ovyr he hathe an
instrucyon that he shall ffelle noo moore.

Item, wheer as he desyryd me to be freendly to hym, I dalte so with hym,
that I trowe he wylle reporte that I seyde and dalte moore cortesly with
hym than he demyd that I wolde doo. Yitt for alle in convenyences that
myght ffalle, I wolde be gladde to have a weell stomakyd felawe that
wolde for my sake everye daye see the seyde woodes of Heylesdon and
Drayton, and to knowe iff any weer fellyd heer afftre; and iffe there be
any fellyd syns that Whetley was theer, and I can preve it by wytnesse,
I sholde have better recompence for every tree than iiij. trees weer
worthe.

Item, it is so that he hathe answeryd to my bille, wheryn he seythe that
he never knywe byfor the subpena delyveryd hym that I hadde any clayme
or entrest in the maner off Heylesdon, but that it was peasyble my
Lordys off Suffolk. Wherffor I suppose that there be many men in
Norwyche that comonyd with hym off the byenge off that woode ere evyr he
made hys fulle bergayne, and per aventure some freendys off hys gave hym
warnyng theroff, and off myn entrest. Iff any suche credyble mane that
hadde hadde any suche langage to hym, or in hys companye, or than he
bargayned, or any man that he laboryd to be halffe marchant or byer with
hym, ar any man that refusyd to bye the seyd wood bycawse off myn
entrest in the presence of Feror, any suche credyble man maye, iff he
wyll, wytnesse ther in with me, or that dare avowe it, sholde be to me a
remedy off alle that is fellyd. I praye yow, if ye can here any suche,
that ye will in the presence off them make a bylle of remembraunce
theroff, and off ther sayng, so that they maye her afftre wytnesse in
the mater. Neverthelesse, trowthe it is that he hadde knowleche ther off
i nowe, and soo hadde every man off hys havore [_substance_] in Norwych,
I dowt nott; and as for hym, I am sure he hadde knowleche, for so moche
as he desyryd at hys bargayn to have a sywerte to be savyd harmeles
ageyn me, whyche was grawntyd hym butt nott executyd. No mor, butt I

Oxon wardys with the Buschopys fyndyng.

The hool some of reseytys ys v_li._ xvij_s._ vj_d._, and the holl some
of exspenses ys vj_li._ v_s._ v_d._ ob. qua., and that comth over the
reseytys in my exspenses I have borowd of Master Edmund, and yt drawyth

them, they be non grete; and therfor I besech yow to send me mony by Syr
Richard Cotman, brynger of thys letter, or ellys by the next masenger
that yow kan have to me.

I besech yow that he that I sent by thys letter to yow may have good

a good lover of myn. Master Edmund Alyard recomaund hym specyaly to yow,

J. WHETLEY TO SIR JOHN PASTON[320-1]

_To the ryght worsh[yp]full Sir John Paston, Knyght, loged at the sygne
off the George at Powlys Wharff, in London, be thys delyvered in hast._

[Sidenote: 1478 / MAY 20]

Pleas it your meastershep to understond the dealyng of every thyng, the
wych I was charged with at my departyng frome your measterchep.

Fyrst, your suppena to Denton was delyvered by me on Trenite Sondaye, in
hys parych cherch, at Matens tyme, be ffor the substans of the parych;
and as for Drayton wod, it is not all down yet, but it drawes fast
toward. I have the names of all the mynestres off and in that wod, and
more schall know or I come, yf ther be any more dealyng, &c.

And as for Haylysdon, my Lord of Suffolk was ther on Wedensday in
Whytson Weke, and ther dined, and drew a stew and toke gret plente of
fych; yet hath he left you a pyke or ij., agayn ye come, the wych wold
be gret comford to all your frendes, and dyscomford to your enmys; for
at hys beyng ther that daye ther was never no man that playd Herrod in
Corpus Crysty[321-1] play better and more agreable to hys pageaunt then
he dud. But ye schall understond that it was after none, and the weder
hot, and he so feble for sekenes that hys legges wold not bere hyme, but
ther was ij. men had gret payn to kepe hym on hys fete; and ther ye were
juged. Som sayd 'Sley;' some sayd 'Put hym in preson.' And forth com my
lord, and he wold met you with a spere, and have none other mendes for
the troble at ye have put hym to but your hart blod, and that will be
gayt with hys owen handes; for and ye have Haylesdon and Dreton, ye
schall have hys lyff with it. And so he comford your enmys with that
word that thay have dealed and dealeth with the wod, and most pryncepall
nowe is Nycolesse Ovye. For as for Ferrer,[321-2] the Meare, he delys
not with owt it be under covert; for it is sayd that he be soght my lord
that he myght have other sygnementes for hys money that he had payd, for
playnly he wold deall no mor with the wod. And so my lord hath set in
the Bayly of Cossay, and all is doon in hys name; and as for hys
servauntes, thay dayly thret my measter your brother and me to slay for
comyng of ther lordes ground, and thay say that we made an entre; and
thay beth answerd as ye comaunded me, for many a gret chalaunge make
thay to Mester John, both Measter Wodhowse, Wysman, with other dyveres
that I know not ther names; but he holdeth hys own that thay gayt no
grownd of hym. And thys he lettes thaym knowe that if thay bete hym or
any of hys, thay schall aby vj. for on, and so thay deall not but with
ther tonges; and as yet, syth Ferrer was at London, there passes not
iij. acres of wod down but thay cary fast for fere of rayn, &c.

Also, sir, I trust to bryng or send hastely the cloth off gold, for it
hath ben largely tempted; but as yet I have none playn answer, but put
in hope. Also I have spoken with Popy for your money, and delyvered hym
your letter, the wych, as he sayth, is a straunge thyng to hym, for, as
I understond, he that owght thys deute was uncle to thys yong man, and
he sayth that hys fader was never exsecutor to hym, nor never mynestred;
and I told hym howe that hys fader was bound for the same deute, in so
mech and my measter wold have forgevyn part of the same deute, he wold
have payed it; and so he will be at London thys terme, and speke with
you, and thys is hys answer.

Morover Wyllyam Worsestre, mevyd unto me of onne Sir Wylliam Bokkyng,
exsecutor and brother to John Bokkyng, the whych was one of Sir John
Fastolf hys clerkes, the whych mater I knewe not, nor had no
comaundement be you to deall therin, and so I told hym. Never the lesse
he sayd that ye promysed hym to have sent your will to have bene done in
that mater by me, and so he troweth that it was owt of your mynd at my
departyng. Yff so be that ye will any thyng to be doon by me or I come
to yow in that mater, let me have knowlege schortly, for I thynk to be
with yow in the weke folowyng aftyr thys wryten, with owt I may have
more comford of money then I have yet.

And as for my meastres, your moder hath ben gretly deseased and so seke
that she wened to have dyed, and hath made her wyll,[322-1] the wyche ye
shall understond more when I come, for ther is every man for hym selff.
I know not the sercomstance of every thyng as yet, and therfor I writ no
more to you therin, but I am promysed to know or I depart from thens.

Also I spake with William Barker, and he sayth that I shall have the
stuff or I depart, or els the monye agayn that he hade of Wylliam
Pecoke.

Also, sir, as for your lond be syd Bromholm that ye had of Bakton, it
hath layn un ocupyed syth ye were ther.

Moreover, my Lord of Suffolk[323-1] is remevyd in to Suffolk the morow
after that he had bene at Haylesdon, and my lady purposed to remeff
after on thys day, Corpus Crysty Evyn, by the grace of Jesu, Who
preserve yow ever in worchep.

Wryten at Norwych, on Wedensday Corpus Crysty Evyn, anno E. iiij^ti

Item, as for the knowleg that Ferror denyed by hys othe that he knew
never no tytle nor entrest that ye had in and to Haylsdon and Dreton, as
yet we can not know; but thys thay will record all that were at the
delyveraunce of the wryt that he sayd my lord had promysed to save hym
harmles, in so mech that Wysman was bownd to Ferrour to save hym
harmeles, and he had for bryngyng that mater about, that Ferrour shuld
have the wod, xx_s._

OXNEAD PARSONAGE[325-1]

_The comodytys off the parsonage and the valew off the benyfyce off
Oxned._

[Sidenote: 1478 / JULY 31]

My new parson off Oxned, whan he is instute and inducte, at the first
entre in to the chyrch and benefyce off Oxned, must off awncyent custom
long contynued with in the dyosesse off Norwyche, pay to the byschopp
off Norwych, for the first frutes off the seyd benefyce, xiiij. marke;
for wyche xiiij. marke, iff the new parson be wytty and have favour a
bowt the Byschops offycers, he schall have days off paiment to pay the
seid xiiij. marke in xiiij. yere, that is, a marke a yere, till it be
payd; so that he can fynd suffycyent mene to be bownd to the Bischopp be
obligacion to kepe his days off payment.

And the chyrch is but litill, and is resonable plesaunt, and reparyd.
[And the] dwellyng place of the parsonage is a yoynyng to the . . . .
. . . d well howsyd and reparyd, hall, chamberes, barn, doffhowse, and
all howsys off offyce.

And it hath a doffhowse worth a yere, xiiij_s._ iiij_d._

And it hath ij. large gardens with frute, and is yonynge to the place
and chyrch yard, wher off the frute is worth yerly, xxvj_s._ viij_d._

And ther longith to the seid parsonage in fre lond, arable, pasture and
medowe ayonyng to the seid parsonage, xxij^ti acre or more, wher off
every acre is worth ij_s._; to latyn [_to let_], iij_li._ iiij_d._

And William Paston, Justice, qwan he[326-1] cam fyrst to dwell in the
maner of Oxned, paid to the parson that was than for the corne growyng
on the parsonage londys and for the tythynges, ondely but in corne whan
it was inned in to the barn, xxiiij_li._

And the same yere the parson had all the awterage and oder profytes be
syde the seyd xxiiij_li._

It is yerly worth, as the world goth now, x_li._

And it is butt an esy cure to kepe, ffor ther ar natt past xx^ti persons
to be yerly howselyd.[326-2]

The parsonage stant be a fresh ryver syde.

And ther is a good markett town callyd Alysham, within ij. myle off the
parsonage.

And the cyte of Norwych is within vj. myle off the parsonage.

And the see is within x. myle off the parsonage.

And if a parson cam now, and warr presentyd, institute, and inducte, he
shuld have by the lawe all the cropp that is now growyng, that was eryd
and sowyn off the old parsons cost, growyng on the parsonage landes now,
as his own good, and all the tyth off all maner graynys off the maner,
londes, and tenantes londes,[326-3] towardes his charges off the fyrst
frutes. And if it ware innyd it war (the crop now growyng)[326-4] worth
his first frutes.

[327-1]He that hath this benefice, and he were a pore man, myght have
lycens to have service be side.

The Beshop ought not to have the valew of this cropp for the arrerages
of the fyrst fruttes that Sir Thomas Everard, last parson of Oxned, oght

the Bisshop in an obligacion for the said frutes, and the said Sir
Thomas Everard, for to defraude the Bysshop and oder men that he owid

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
