OLD FATHER TIME.


"Professor," said May, turning on the sofa where she was lying, "Jack
has brought me a calendar that runs for ever so many years. You know the
doctor says I'll not be well for two whole years, or perhaps three. I
have been wondering what month among them all I shall be able to run
about in; and then I began to think who could have made the first
calendar, and what led him to do it."

"That's very simple, May. Old Father Time just measured the days off
with his hour-glass in the first place, and marked them down with the
point of his scythe. The world has known all about it ever since."

"Please don't, Jack. Let the Professor tell."

"It would be hard, May, to tell who made the first calendar," answered
the Professor. "All nations seem to have had their methods of counting
the years and months long before they began writing histories, so that
there is no record of the origin of the custom. The Book of Genesis
mentions the lights in the heavens as being 'for signs and for seasons,
and for days and years.' And Moses uses the word _year_ so often that
we see that it must have been common to count the years among those who
lived before him."

"The number 1880 means that it is so many years since the birth of
Christ, does it not?" asked Joe.

"Yes," said the Professor, "it has been the custom among Christian
nations to reckon the years from that great event. They began to do this
about the year of our Lord 532."

"Why did they wait so long?" asked Joe.

"You know," he said, "that at first the Christians were very few and
weak; during the first three hundred years they had all they could do to
escape with their lives from their enemies. But after that they became
very numerous and powerful, and were able to establish their own
customs. So in 532 a monk named Dionysius Exiguus proposed that they
should abandon the old way of counting the years, and adopt the time of
the birth of Christ as a starting-point. He thought this would be a very
proper way of honoring the Saviour of the world. So he took great pains
to find out the exact time when Christ was born, and satisfied himself
that it was on the 25th day of December, in the 753d year from the
foundation of the city of Rome. The Roman Empire at one time included
most of the known world; and the Roman people, proud of their splendid
city, counted the years from the supposed time of its being founded. At
first the Christians did the same; but they were naturally pleased with
the idea of Dionysius."

"Was he the first man who tried to find out what day Christmas came on?"
asked Joe. "I should think everybody would have been anxious to know all
about it."

"Doubtless there was much interest on the subject. But you know the
early Christians had no newspapers, and very few books. Scarcely any of
them could even read. Besides, it was very difficult in those times to
travel or gain information; and it was dangerous to ask questions of the
heathen, or for a man to let them suspect that he was a Christian. And
then when we consider that the calendar was in confusion, because even
the wisest men did not know the exact length of the year, and there were
various ways of counting time, we need not be surprised that the
Christians disagreed and made mistakes as to the time when the Saviour
was born. In the fourth century, however, St. Cyril urged Pope Julius I.
to give orders for an investigation. The result was that the theologians
of the East and West agreed upon the 25th of December, though some of
them were not convinced. The chief grounds of the decision were the
tables in the public records of Rome.

"But let us return to Dionysius. His idea of making the year begin on
the 25th of December was thought to be rather too inconvenient, and so
the old commencement on the first day of January was retained, as the
Romans had arranged it. But the plan of Dionysius was carried out with
regard to the numbers by which the years were to be named and called.
Thus the year which had been known as 754 became, under the new system,
the year 1. And the succession of years from that year 1 is called the
Christian era. To get the numbers of its years you have only to subtract
753 from the years in the Roman numbering."

"If we add 753," said Joe, "to 1880, will we get the number of years
since old Rome was founded by Romulus and Remus?"

"Yes," said the Professor; "the rule works both ways. There is, however,
some uncertainty as to whether the Romans themselves were correct in
regard to the age of their city. Very early dates are hard to settle."

"Where did the months get their names?" asked May, "and how did months
come to be thought of at all?"

"The months were suggested by the moon. In most languages the word
_month_ is very nearly like _moon_, as you see it is in ours. From new
moon around to new moon again is about twenty-nine days, which is nearly
the length of a month. The exact time between two new moons is a very
puzzling problem. It always involves a troublesome fraction of a day,
and is, in fact, never twice alike. So it was found convenient to divide
the year into twelve parts, nearly equal, and to call each one a month."

"Why didn't they make them just equal?" asked Gus.

"To do so would have made it necessary to split up some of the days,
which would have been awkward. If you divide the 365 days of the year by
twelve, there will be five remaining."

"How was it found out that the year had 365 days in it?" asked Joe.

"It took the astronomers to do that," said the Professor; "and until
nations became civilized enough to study astronomy accurately, they did
not know the number of days in the year. This, however, did not prevent
them from being able to count the years, because they could know that
every time summer or winter came, a year had passed since the last
summer or winter. But now the length of the year--that is, the time
occupied by the earth in going completely round the sun--is known within
a fraction of a second."

"Was it worth while to go into it so precisely?" asked May. "Would it
not have been enough to know the number of the days?"

"By no means," said the Professor. "For then the calendar could not have
been regulated so that the months and festivals would keep pace with the
seasons. If 365 days had been constantly taken for a year, Christmas,
instead of staying in the winter, would long since have moved back
through autumn into summer, and so on. In about 1400 years it would
travel through the entire circle of the seasons, as it would come some
six hours earlier every year than it did the last. In like manner the
Fourth of July would gradually fall back into spring, then into winter;
and the fire-works would have to be set off in the midst of a
snow-storm. The old Romans saw the difficulty; and, to prevent it,
Julius Caesar added an extra day to every fourth year, which you see is
the same thing as adding one-fourth of a day to each year, only it is
much more convenient. This was done because the earth requires nearly
365-1/4 days to move round the sun. The year that receives the extra day
is called, as you know, leap-year. But even this did not keep the
calendar exactly right. In the course of time other changes had to be
made, the greatest of which was in 1582, when Pope Gregory XIII. decreed
that ten entire days should be dropped out of the month of October. This
was called the change from Old to New Style."

"It was rather stupid," said Gus, "to shorten the pleasantest month in
the whole year. I would have clipped December or March."

"Please don't forget to tell us," said May, "how the months got their
names."

"The first six of them were called after the heathen deities, Janus,
Februus, Mars, Aphrodite, Maia, and Juno; July was named after Julius
Caesar, the inventor of leap-year; August after Augustus the Emperor. The
names of the last four months simply mean seventh, eighth, ninth, and
tenth."

"But," said Joe, "December is not the tenth month, nor is September the
seventh."

"That is true," said the Professor; "but those names are supposed to
have been given by Romulus, who arranged a year of only ten months, and
made it begin with March. His year only had 304 days in it, and was soon
found to be much too short. So the months of January and February were
added, and instead of being placed at the end, they came in some way to
stand at the beginning."

"Now please tell us about the names of the days of the week, and we will
not ask any more questions."

"They were called after the sun, moon, and five planets known to the
ancients, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn. You easily
recognize sun, moon, and Saturn, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday are from
names given by some of the Northern tribes of Europe to Mars, Jupiter,
and Venus. Mercury's day seems scarcely at all connected with his name,
but comes from Wodin, who was imagined to be chief among the gods of
those barbarous tribes."




TOMMY'S VALENTINE.

BY MRS. M. D. BRINE.


  He was only a little street sweeper, you know,
    Barefooted, and ragged as one could be;
  But blue were his eyes as the far-off skies,
    And a brave-hearted laddie was Tommy Magee.
  But it chanced on the morning of Valentine's Day
    Our little street sweeper felt lonely and sad;
  "For there's _no fun_," thought he, "for a fellow like me,
    And a valentine's something that _I_ never had."

  But he flourished his broom, and the crossing made clean
    For the ladies and gentlemen passing his way;
  And he gave them a smile, singing gayly the while,
    In honor, of course, of St. Valentine's Day.
  Now it happened a party of bright little girls,
    All dainty and rosy, and brimming with glee,
  Came over the crossing, a careless glance tossing
    To poor little barefooted Tommy Magee.

  But all of a sudden then one of them turned,
    And running to Tommy, thrust into his hand,
  With a smile and a blush, and the whispered word "Hush,"
    A beautiful valentine. You'll understand
  How Tommy stood gazing, with wondering eyes,
    After the group of wee ladies so fine,
  As with joy without measure he held his new treasure;
    And this is how Tommy got _his_ valentine.




LOST IN THE SNOW.


Among the dangers of the winter in the Pass of St. Gothard is the
fearful snow-storm called the "guxeten" by the Germans, and the
tourmente or "tormenta" by the Swiss. The mountain snow differs in form,
as well as in thickness and specific gravity, from the star-shaped
snow-flakes on the lower heights and in the valleys. It is quite floury,
dry, and sandy, and therefore very light. When viewed though a
microscope it assumes at times the form of little prismatic needles, at
other times that of innumerable small six-sided pyramids, from which, as
from the morning star, little points jut out on all sides, and which,
driven by the wind, cut through the air with great speed. With this fine
ice-dust of the mountain snow, the wind drives its wild game through the
clefts of the high Alps and over the passes, particularly that of St.
Gothard. Suddenly it tears up a few hundred thousand cubic feet of this
snow, and whirls it up high into the air, leaving it to the mercy of the
upper current, to fall to the ground again in the form of the thickest
snow-storm, or to be dispersed at will like glittering ice-crystals. At
times the wind sweeps up large tracts of the dry ice-dust, and pours
them down upon a deep-lying valley amid the mountains, or on to the
summit of the passes, obliterating in a few seconds the laboriously
excavated mountain road, at which a whole company of rutners have toiled
for days. All these appearances resemble the avalanches of other Alps,
but can not be regarded in the same light as the true snow-storm, the
tormenta or guxeten. This is incomparably more severe, and hundreds on
hundreds of lives have fallen sacrifices to its fury. These have mostly
been travelling strangers, who either did not distinguish the signs of
the coming storm, or, in proud reliance on their own power, refused to
listen to well-meant warnings, and continued their route. Almost every
year adds a large number of victims to the list of those who have fallen
a prey to the snow-storm.

History and the oral tradition of the mountains record many incidents of
accidents which have been occasioned by the fall of avalanches. During
the Bellinzona war, in 1478, as the confederates, with a force of 10,000
men, were crossing the St. Gothard, the men of Zuerich were preceding the
army as van-guard. They had just refreshed themselves with some wine,
and were marching up the wild gorge, shouting and singing, in spite of
the warnings of their guides. Then, in the heights above, an avalanche
was suddenly loosened, which rushed down upon the road, and in its
impetuous torrent buried sixty warriors far below in the Reuss, in full
sight of those following.

On the 12th of March, 1848, in the so-called Planggen, above the tent of
shelter at the Maetelli, thirteen men who were conveying the post were
thrown by a violent avalanche into the bed of the Reuss, with their
horses and sledges. Three men, fathers of families, and nine horses were
killed; the others were saved by hastily summoned help. But one of their
deliverers, Joseph Mueller, of Hospenthal, met a hero's death while
engaged in the rescue. He had hastened to help his neighbors, but in the
district called the "Harness" he and two others were overwhelmed by a
second violent avalanche, and lost their lives. In the same year the
post going up the mountain from Airola was overtaken by an avalanche
near the house of shelter at Ponte Tremola. A traveller from Bergamo was
killed; the rest escaped.

History tells of a most striking rescue from an avalanche on the St.
Gothard. In the year 1628, Landamman Kaspar, of Brandenburg, the newly
chosen Governor of Bellenz, was riding over the St. Gothard from Zug,
accompanied by his servant and a faithful dog. At the top of the pass
the party was overtaken by an avalanche which descended from the
Lucendro. The dog alone shook himself free. His first care was to
extricate his master. But when he saw that he could not succeed in doing
this, he hastened back to the hospice, and there, by pitiful howling and
whining, announced that an accident had happened. The landlord and his
servants set out immediately with shovels and pickaxes, and followed the
dog, which ran quickly before them. They soon reached the place where
the avalanche had fallen. Here the faithful dog stopped suddenly,
plunged his face into the snow, and began to scratch it up, barking and
whining. The men set to work at once, and after a long and difficult
labor succeeded in rescuing the Landamman, and soon afterward his
servant. They were both alive, after spending thirty-six fearful hours
beneath the snow, oppressed by the most painful thoughts. They had heard
the howling and barking of the dog quite plainly; and had noticed his
sudden departure, and the arrival of their deliverers; they had heard
them talking and working, without being able to move or utter a sound.
The Landamman's will ordained that an image of the faithful dog should
be sculptured at his feet on his tomb. This monument was seen till
lately in St. Oswald's Church, at Zug.




THE STORY OF GRANDMA, LORENZO, AND THE MONKEY.

BY MRS. A. M. DIAZ.


The children told the Family Story-Teller they did not believe he could
make a story about a grandma going to mill. "Especially," said the
children's mother, "a grandma troubled with rheumatism."

Family Story-Teller smiled, as much as to say, "You shall see," took a
few minutes to think, and began:

       *       *       *       *       *

In Grandma Stimpcett's trunk was a very small, leathery, beady bag, and
in this bag was a written recipe for the Sudden Remedy--a sure cure for
rheumatism, sprains, bruises, and all lamenesses. The bag and the recipe
were given her by an Indian woman. To make the Sudden Remedy, grandma
got roots, herbs, barks, twigs, leaves, mints, moss, and tree gum. These
were scraped, grated, or pounded; sifted, weighed, measured, stewed,
and stirred; and the juice simmered down with the oil of juniper, and
bumble-bees' wax, and various smarty, peppery, slippery things whose
names must be kept private for a particular reason. The Sudden Remedy
cured her instantly; and as meal was wanted, and no other person could
be spared from the place, she offered to go to mill.

She went in the vehicle--an old chaise which had lost its top--taking
with her her bottle of the Sudden Remedy, in case, as Mr. Stimpcett
said, the rheumatism should return before she did.

"Shall you be back by sunset?" asked Mr. Stimpcett, as he fastened the
bag underneath the vehicle.

"Oh yes," said she; "I shall eat dinner at Debby's, and come away right
after dinner. You will see me back long before sunset." Her daughter
Debby lived at Mill Village.

Mr. Stimpcett shook his head. "I don't know about that," said he.

"If I am not back before sunset," said she, "I will give you--give you
five hundred dollars."

The people laughed at this; for all the money grandma had was only about
twenty dollars, put away in case of need.

Now when grandma had driven perhaps two miles on her way to mill, she
stopped at a farm-house to water her horse; and here something curious
happened. A woman came to the door of the house, and the next moment a
large boy, named Lorenzo, hopped out on one foot and two canes, and
began stumping about the yard at a furious rate, cackling, crowing, and
barking.

"That's the way he does when he can't sit still any longer," said the
woman. "He has to sit still a great deal, on account of a lame knee,
which is a pity," said she, "for a spry fellow like him; a good,
true-spoken fellow he is, too." The woman then told how he lamed his
knee.

Lorenzo said he wanted very much the use of his legs that day, because
there was to be a circus just beyond Mill Village. He said he wanted to
go to the circus so much he did not know what to do. He said he began
when he was four years old to go to circuses, and he had been to every
circus that had come around since. "Now this circus is only a little
more than two miles off," said he, "and here I am cooped up like a
hoppled horse."

[Illustration: "THIS BOTTLE CONTAINS THE SUDDEN REMEDY."]

Grandma smiled, and took out the bottle. "This bottle," said she,
"contains the Sudden Remedy--a quick cure for rheumatism, sprains,
bruises, and all lamenesses. Rub on with a flannel, and rub in briskly."

Lorenzo rubbed on with a flannel, and rubbed in briskly, and then seated
himself upon a stone to hear the stories grandma and the woman were
telling of people who had been upset, or thrown from horses, or had
fallen over stone walls, into wells, or down from trees, rocks,
house-tops, or chamber windows. Lorenzo told some stories, and at last,
in acting out one, he thrust forward his lame leg, without thinking of
it, and found it was no longer lame. He tried it again; he sprang up; he
stepped; he walked; he leaped; he skipped; he ran; he hurrahed; he flung
his canes away.

Grandma then invited Lorenzo to ride with her to Mill Village, near
which the circus was to be; and he quickly took a seat in the vehicle,
and having no time to put on his best clothes, he put on only his best
hat, tipping it one side in order to give himself a little of a
dressed-up look.

When grandma and Lorenzo reached Mill Village, Lorenzo got out at a
pea-nut stand, and grandma drove on to her daughter Debby's. She had
just stepped from the vehicle when Lorenzo came running to beg that she
would bring her Sudden Remedy to the miller's house, for the miller had
been taken that morning with the darting rheumatism, and the mill was
not running, and people were waiting with their corn.

Lorenzo drove grandma to the miller's house, and in two hours' time the
miller was in the mill, the wheel turning, and the corn
grinding--grandma's corn among the rest.

Something which was very important to the circus will now be told. The
Chief Jumper--the one who was to do the six wonderful things--lamed his
foot the night before, and could not jump. Now when the man who owned
the circus was looking at the Chief Jumper's foot, a circus errand-boy
in uniform passed by. This errand-boy had been to the mill to get corn
for the circus horses, and he told the man who owned the circus that a
woman had just cured the miller of the darting rheumatism, and told the
name of the medicine.

The circus owner took one of the circus riding wagons and the errand-boy
in uniform and set off immediately to find the woman who had the Sudden
Remedy, and found grandma at her daughter Debby's, just stepping into
the vehicle to go home. Lorenzo was there, fastening the bag of meal
securely under the vehicle. The circus owner offered grandma five
dollars if she would go and cure his Chief Jumper, and as there was time
to do that and reach home before sunset, she went, Lorenzo driving her
in the vehicle. The circus owner and the errand-boy in uniform kept just
in front of them, and some children who knew no better said that that
kind-looking old lady and the great boy belonged to the circus, and had
their circus clothes in the bag underneath.

Grandma was taken into a tent which led out of the big tent, where she
saw the Chief Jumper in full jumping costume, and the Dwarf, and the Fat
Man, and the Clown, and the Flying Cherub; and the Remedy worked so well
that the Chief Jumper thought he might jump higher than ever before.

[Illustration: THE LAME MONKEY.]

The Clown led grandma to the cage where monkeys were kept, and asked her
if she would be willing to cure a poor suffering monkey whose leg had
been hurt by a stone thrown by a cruel boy. Grandma said, certainly, for
that she pitied even an animal that had to suffer pain. The Clown then
took the monkey, and held its paw while grandma patted its head and
stroked its back, and poured on the Remedy, the Flying Cherub standing
near by to see what was to be done.

The circus owner invited grandma to stay to the circus; but as she had
not time, he paid her eight dollars, and led her to the vehicle.

Now we are coming to the most wonderful part of my story. People going
home from mill had told the tale of the miller's cure, and on her way
back grandma was stopped by various people, who begged her to come into
their houses and cure rheumatism, sprains, bruises, and other
lamenesses. This took a great deal of time; but the kind-hearted old
lady was so anxious to ease pain that she forgot all about her promise
to Mr. Stimpcett, and when she reached home it was ten minutes past
sunset.

Three buggies stood near Mr. Stimpcett's house. Grandma thought they
were doctors' buggies. "Oh dear!" she said to herself, "something
dreadful must be the matter!" She counted the children playing at the
door-step. They were all there--Moses, Obadiah, Deborah, and little
Cordelia.

At this moment Mr. Stimpcett came forward and said to grandma that three
gentlemen had come, one after another, and had each asked to have a
private talk with her. There was a large fleshy man in the front room, a
chubby little man in the kitchen, and a sleek, long-faced man in the
spare chamber.

Grandma talked with these, one at a time. They were all medicine
sellers. Each one wished to buy the recipe for making the Sudden Remedy,
and would pay a good price for it. For they knew that thousands and
thousands of barrels of this Remedy could be sold all over the United
States, Mexico, Canada, and Central America, and enormous sums of money
made by the sale.

The summer boarder, Mr. St. Clair, said that the man who would pay the
most money for it ought to have the recipe. Grandma brought from her
trunk the small, leathery, beady bag which contained the recipe, and Mr.
St. Clair stood in the vehicle, held up the bag, and said: "Bid!
gentlemen, bid! How much do I have for it?"

The bidding was interrupted by a Jumper. It was a circus Jumper, but not
the Chief Jumper. While the people were all looking at Mr. St. Clair, a
monkey sprang from the meal bag underneath the vehicle and jumped upon
grandma's shoulder, nearly knocking her over. It was the same one she
had cured. On account of his lameness, he had been loosely tied, and
from a feeling of thankfulness, no doubt, for being cured, he had run
away and followed grandma.

The Stimpcett children--Moses, Obadiah, Deborah, and little
Cordelia--shouted and capered so that the selling of the recipe could
hardly go on; but at last it was sold, leathery, beady bag and all, to
the sleek, long-faced man, for nine hundred dollars, of which grandma
gave five hundred to Mr. Stimpcett, according to the promise she made
before going to mill.

The circus people were written to, but as they did not send for Jacko,
he was kept for the children, to play with. Mrs. Stimpcett dressed him
in a pretty suit of clothes, with a cap and feather on his head. He
showed much affection for grandma, followed her about daytimes both
in-doors and out, and would sleep nowhere at night but at the foot of
her bed, where a bandbox was at last placed for him. The children loved
him dearly; but poor Jacko did so much mischief in trying to knit, and
to cook, and to weed the garden, that it was finally declared that
something must be done about that monkey; and grandma gave him to
Lorenzo, with money enough to buy a grand harmonica.

Lorenzo came for the monkey toward the close of a calm summer's day, and
fed him with frosted cake, which caused him to feel pleased with
Lorenzo. There was a string fastened to his collar; Lorenzo took the
string in one hand, and some frosted cake in the other, and led Jacko
away. The children--Moses, and Obadiah, and Deborah, and little
Cordelia--following on for quite a distance, all weeping.

[Illustration: THE TWO-CENT SIDE-SHOW.]

Lorenzo went about for some time with a circus company. Evenings he
staid inside the big tent to see the doings, and daytimes he had a
two-cent side-show in a small tent of his own, where the monkey played
wonderful tricks, and marched to the music of the grand harmonica.

At last he came to grandma, and told her that as for the Clown, he was a
kind-hearted, sensible man, but that the others were commonly either
drunk, or cross, or both, and that he had to travel nights, wet or dry,
and that he was sick of that kind of life. He sold the monkey to a
hand-organ man, and went back to live in his old home; and the last that
was known of Jacko he was seen in the streets of a town carrying round
the hand-organ man's hat for pennies.

It was grandma and Mr. Stimpcett who saw him, as they were riding past
in the vehicle; and he saw them, and gave a bound, and broke his string,
and leaped into the vehicle, and clasped his paws round grandma's neck;
and the hand-organ man was obliged to place six maple-sugar cakes in a
row upon the sidewalk before Jacko would return to him.

The sleek, long-faced man made his fortune by selling the Sudden Remedy,
but few of those who bought it and took it knew what old lady it was who
sold him the recipe for it.

It very often happens that children of royal families are by their
parents or by wise statesmen engaged to marry each other almost as soon
as they are born, but the actual weddings do not generally take place
until the children are grown up. One of these weddings did, however,
actually take place, a great many years ago, between two children, and
the story of it is as follows:

January 15, 1478, was the day appointed, when Richard, Duke of York,
second son of Edward IV., aged four years, and created already Duke of
Norfolk, Earl Warren and Surrey, and Earl Marshal of England, in right
of his intended wife, was to lead to the altar the little girl whose
tiny hand would bestow upon him the immense estates and riches of the
Norfolk inheritance.

The little Lady Anne, who was, as an old book informs us, the richest
and most noble match of that time, appears to have been two years older
than her intended husband, and must have reached the advanced age of six
years! She does not appear to have objected to the match, but to have
been quite ready to act her part in the pageant, and no doubt the little
Duke was eager to receive the notice and applause of the courtly throng,
whilst both children looked with astonishment at the sumptuous
preparations, and the costly splendor of their own and the spectators'
dresses.

The ceremony began by the high and mighty Princess, as the little bride
was called in the formal language of the day, being brought in great
state and in solemn procession to the King's great chamber at
Westminster Palace. This took place the day before the wedding, on the
14th of January. The bride, splendidly dressed, most probably in the
bridal robes of white cloth of gold, a mantle of the same bordered with
ermine, and with her hair streaming down her back, and confined to her
head by the coronet of a duchess, was led by the Earl of Rivers, the
bridegroom's uncle. She was followed, of course, by her mother, and by
the noblest of the court ladies of rank, and the gentlewomen of her
household, whilst behind came dukes, earls, and barons, all in
attendance on the little bride.

As soon as she had arrived in the lofty hall of Westminster Palace she
was led to the dais, or place of estate, as it was called, where, under
a canopy, and seated on a chair of estate, or kind of throne, she kept
her estate, _i. e._, sat in royal pomp with the King, Queen, and their
children seated on either hand, whilst her procession of peers and
peeresses stood around and waited upon her. Refreshments were then
brought "according to the form and estate of the realm," which must have
been a very wearisome and formal ceremony for a little girl of six years
old, and which ended that day's ceremony.

On the 15th the Princess came out of the Queen's rooms, where she had
slept, and led on one hand by the Earl of Lincoln, nephew to the King,
and on the other by the Earl of Rivers, she passed through the King's
great chamber in the palace into the White Hall, and from there to St.
Stephen's Chapel. She was followed by a long suite of ladies and
gentlewomen. Meanwhile the little bridegroom, the Queen, and a noble
procession of lords and gentlemen, had already entered the chapel and
taken up their places on the seats appointed for them, ready to receive
and welcome the bride. There were also present the King and the Prince
of Wales, the King's mother, and the three Princesses who acted as
bridemaids, Elizabeth, Mary, and Cecily.

As soon as the bride drew near to the door, between her two noble
supporters, the Bishop of Norwich came forward and received her at the
chapel entrance, intending to lead her and the bridegroom to their
proper places and begin the service. Then the bishop asked who would
give the Princess away? In answer the King stood up and took her hand,
and gave it to the bishop, who placed it in the bridegroom's, and went
on to the rest of the service, concluding with high mass. When this part
was concluded, the Duke of Gloucester brought into the chapel basins of
gold filled with gold and silver pieces, which he threw amongst the
crowds of people who had pressed in to see the wedding, and who were
highly delighted with this part of it.

Then followed the usual wine and spices, which were actually served out
to the royal party in the church itself. The bridal party then left the
chapel, the little bride and bridegroom, escorted by the Duke of
Gloucester and the Duke of Buckingham (Richard's two uncles) on either
side. They returned to St. Edward's Chamber in the palace, where a
splendid banquet was prepared, and their numbers were increased by the
bride's mother, who staid at home, strange to say, instead of
accompanying her daughter and the Duchess of Buckingham. Another guest
who now presided at a table on one side of the room with many ladies,
whilst the Earl of Dorset, the Queen's son by her first husband, sat
opposite at another side table, was the Earl of Richmond, afterward
Henry VII., who, wonderful to say, was present, and whom Edward IV. must
have invited to get him into his power. However, as soon as the
marriage feasts were over, he managed to escape abroad without being
stopped by the King.

The banquet completed the festivities of the wedding day, and, tired and
wearied, the baby couple must have been glad to close their eyes in
sleep.

No marriage, however, was complete without a tournament, and so on the
18th, when the children had recovered the fatigue of their wedding, a
grand tournament took place, when the bride became the "Princess of the
Feast," took up her place at the head of the first banqueting table, and
there, supported by the Dukes of Gloucester and Buckingham, gave her
largesse to the heralds, who proclaimed her name and title in due form.

All the royal family were present, and the foreign ambassadors, and one
of the most distinguished spectators was "my lord of Richmond." The
coursers were running at each other with either spear or sword, and at
the close of the jousts, the Princess of the Feast, with all her ladies
and gentlewomen, withdrew to the King's great chamber at Westminster to
decide upon the prizes. First, however, the high and mighty Princess
called in her minstrels, and all the ladies and gentlewomen, lords and
knights, fell to dancing right merrily. Then came the king-at-arms to
announce to the Princess the names of those whose valor deserved the
rewards she was to give away, as the principal lady on whom the duty
devolved. But the little lady was both very young and bashful, and so to
help her the lovely Princess Elizabeth, then a girl of fourteen, was
appointed, and a council of ladies was held to consider the share each
should take.

The prizes were golden letters, A, E, and M, the initials of Anne,
Elizabeth, and Mowbray, set in gems, and were delivered to Elizabeth by
the king-at-arms. The A was to be awarded to the best jouster, the E to
the best runner in harness, and the M for the best swordsman. The first
prize was then presented by the little bride, aided by Elizabeth, to
Thomas Fynes, on which the chief herald cried out, "Oh yes! oh yes! oh
yes! Sir William Truswell jousted well; William Say jousted well; Thomas
Fynes jousted best; for the which the Princess of the Feast awarded the
prize of the jousts royal, that is to say, the A of gold, to him," quoth
Clarencieux.

Then the other prizes were given with the same ceremonies, the
king-at-arms, Clarencieux, proclaiming in a loud voice before each,
"Right high and excellent Princess, here is the prize which you shall
award unto the best jouster," which Elizabeth received and then handed
to her little sister-in-law, until all had been given, and the
tournament was over. And now the infant marriage, with its pretty
pageantry and joyous festivities, was concluded, and the children
returned to the daily routine of play and lessons, whilst the wonderful
wedding must have gradually faded from their memories.




A HUNTING ADVENTURE.


While travelling in India, an English officer once spent a night in a
small village, the inhabitants of which were much alarmed by a large
panther which lurked in the jungle just beyond their houses. They begged
the officer to kill it before he proceeded on his journey. He succeeded
in finding and wounding it the next morning, but before killing it, had
a terrible struggle, which he describes as follows:

"Having warned the village shikaree to keep close behind me with the
heavy spear he had in his hand, I began to follow the wounded panther;
but had scarcely gone twenty-five yards, when one of the beaters, who
was on high ground, beckoned to me, and pointed a little below him, and
in front of me. There was the large panther sitting out unconcealed
between two bushes a dozen yards before me. I could not, however, see
his head; and whilst I was thus delayed, he came out with a roar,
straight at me. I fired at his chest with a ball, and as he sprang upon
me, the shot barrel was aimed at his head. In the next moment he seized
my left arm, and the gun. Thus, not being able to use the gun as a club,
I forced it into his mouth. He bit the stock through in one place, and
whilst his upper fangs lacerated my arm and hand, the lower fangs went
into the gun. His hind claws pierced my left thigh. He tried very hard
to throw me over. In the mean while the shikaree had retreated some
paces to the left. He now, instead of spearing the panther, shouted out,
and struck him, using the spear as a club. In a moment the animal was
upon him, stripping him of my shikar-bag, his turban, my revolving
rifle, and the spear. The man passed by me, holding his wounded arm. The
panther quietly crouched five paces in front of me, with all my
despoiled property, stripped from the shikaree, around and under him. I
retreated step by step, my face toward the foe, till I got to my horse,
and to the beaters, who were all collected together some forty yards
from the fight.

"I immediately loaded the gun with a charge of shot and a bullet, and
taking my revolver pistol out of the holster, and sticking it into my
belt, determined to carry on the affair to its issue, knowing how rarely
men recover from such wounds as mine. I was bleeding profusely from
large tooth wounds in the arm; the tendons of my left hand were torn
open, and I had five claw wounds in the thigh. The poor shikaree's arm
was somewhat clawed up, and if the panther was not killed, the
superstition of the natives would go far to kill this man.

"I persuaded my horse-keeper to come with me, and taking the hog-spear
he had in his hand, we went to the spot where lay the weapons stripped
from the shikaree. A few yards beyond them crouched the huge panther
again. I could not see his head very distinctly, but fired deliberately
behind his shoulder. In one moment he was again upon me. I gave him the
charge of shot, as I supposed, in his face, but had no time to take aim.
In the next instant the panther got hold of my left foot in his teeth,
and threw me on my back. I struck at him with the empty gun, and he
seized the barrels in his mouth. This was his last effort. I sprang up,
and seizing the spear from the horse-keeper, drove it through his side,
and thus killed him."




EAGLES AND THEIR WAYS.


The great golden eagle is one of the most distinguished members of its
mighty family. It is found in many parts of the world, a kingly
inhabitant of mountainous regions, where it builds its nest on rocky
crags accessible only to the most daring hunter.

This noble bird is of a rich blackish-brown tint on the greater part of
its body, its head and neck inclining to a reddish color. Its tail is
deep gray crossed with dark brown bars. Some large specimens which have
been captured have measured nearly four feet in length, while the
magnificent wings expanded from eight to nine feet.

The golden eagle is no longer found in England, but is still plentiful
in the Scottish Highlands, where it makes its nest on some lofty ledge
of rock among the mountain solitudes. Swiss naturalists state that it
sometimes nests in the lofty crotch of some gigantic oak growing on the
lower mountain slopes, but Audubon and other eminent ornithologists
declare that an eagle's nest built in a tree has never come under their
observation.

The nest of this inhabitant of the mountains is not neatly made, like
those of smaller birds, but is a huge mass of twigs, dried grasses,
brambles, and hair heaped together to form a bed for the little ones.
Here the mother bird lays three or four large white eggs speckled with
brown. The young birds are almost coal-black, and only assume the golden
and brownish tinge as they become full grown, which is not until about
the fourth year. Eaglets two or three years old are described in books
of natural history as ring-tailed eagles, and are sometimes taken for a
distinct species of the royal bird, while in reality they are the
children of the golden eagle tribe.

Eagles rarely change their habitation, and, unless disturbed, a pair
will inhabit the same nest for years. It is very faithful to its mate,
and one pair have been observed living happily together through a long
life. Should one die, the bird left alone will fly away in search of
another mate, and soon return with it to its former home. Eagles live to
a great age; even in captivity in royal gardens specimens have been
known to live more than a hundred years.

Eagles are very abundant in Switzerland. Although not so powerful as the
great vulture, which also inhabits the lofty mountains, they are bolder
and more enduring. For hours the golden eagle will soar in the air high
above the mountain-tops, and move in wide-sweeping circles with a
scarcely perceptible motion of its mighty wings. When on the hunt for
prey, it is very cunning and sharp-sighted. Its shrill scream rings
through the air, filling all the smaller birds with terror. When it
approaches its victim its scream changes to a quick kik-kak-kak,
resembling the barking of a dog, and gradually sinking until
sufficiently near, it darts in a straight line with the rapidity of
lightning upon its prey. None of the smaller birds and beasts are safe
from its clutches. Fawns, rabbits, and hares, young sheep and goats,
wild birds of all kinds, fall helpless victims, for neither the swiftest
running nor the most rapid flight can avail against this king of the
air.

The strength of the eagle is such that it will bear heavy burdens in its
talons for miles until it reaches its nest, where the hungry little ones
are eagerly waiting the parent's return. Here, standing on the ledge of
rock, the eagle tears the food into morsels, which the eaglets eagerly
devour. It is a curious fact that near an eagle's nest there is usually
a storehouse or larder--some convenient ledge of rock--where the parent
birds lay up hoards of provisions. Hunters have found remains of lambs,
young pigs, rabbits, partridges, and other game heaped up ready for the
morning meal.

[Illustration: EAGLES FIGHTING OVER A CHAMOIS.]

Over its hunting ground the eagle is king. It fears neither bird nor
beast, its only enemy being man. In Switzerland, during the winter
season, when the mountains are snow-bound, the eagle will descend to the
plain in search of food. When driven by hunger, it will seize on
carrion, and even fight desperately with its own kind for the possession
of the desired food. Swiss hunters tell many stories of furious battles
between eagles over the dead body of some poor chamois or other mountain
game.

Eagles are very affectionate and faithful to their little ones as long
as they need care; but once the young eaglets are able to take care of
themselves, the parent birds drive them from the nest, and even from the
hunting ground. The young birds are often taken from the nest by
hunters, who with skill and daring scale the rocky heights during the
absence of the parents, which return to find a desolate and empty nest.
But it goes hard with the hunter if the keen eyes of the old birds
discover him before he has made his safe descent with his booty. Darting
at him with terrible fury, they try their utmost to throw him from the
cliff; and unless he be well armed, and use his weapons with skill and
rapidity, his position is one of the utmost peril.

The young birds are easily tamed; and the experiment has already been
tried with some success of using them as the falcon, to assist in
hunting game.

The golden eagle is an inhabitant of the Rocky Mountains, but is very
seldom seen farther eastward. Audubon reports having noticed single
pairs in the Alleghanies, in Maine, and even in the valley of the
Hudson; but such examples are very rare, for this royal bird is truly a
creature of the mountains. It fears neither cold nor tempestuous winds
nor icy solitudes.

The eagle's plume is an old and famous decoration of warriors and
chieftains, and is constantly alluded to, especially in Scottish legend
and song. The Northwestern Indians ornament their headdresses and their
weapons with the tail feathers of the eagle, and institute hunts for the
bird with the sole purpose of obtaining them. Indians prize these
feathers so highly that they will barter a valuable horse for the tail
of a single bird.

Royal and noble in its bearing, the eagle has naturally been chosen as
the symbol of majesty and power. It served as one of the imperial
emblems of ancient Rome, and is employed at the present time for the
regal insignia of different countries. The bald eagle, the national bird
of the United States, belongs to the same great family as its golden
cousin, and is a sharer of its lordly characteristics.

THE HIDDEN BEAUTIES OF THE SNOW


[Illustration: Left Side Border]

[Illustration: Right Side Border]

In the falling of the snow we have snow _showers_ and snow _storms_. In
the snow _shower_ the air is filled with light, fleecy flakes, which
descend gently and noiselessly through it, and either melt away and
disappear as fast as they alight, or else, when the temperature is below
the point of freezing, slowly accumulate upon every surface where they
can gain a lodgment, until the fields are everywhere covered with a
downy fleece of spotless purity, and every salient point--the tops of
the fences and posts, the branches of the trees, and the interminable
lines of telegraph wire--are adorned with a white and dazzling trimming.
In such a fall of snow as this the delicate process of crystallization
is not disturbed by any agitations in the air. The feathery needles from
each little nucleus extend themselves in every direction as far as they
will, and combining by gentle contacts with others floating near them,
form large and fleecy flakes, involving the nicest complications of
structure, and filling the air with a kind of beauty in which the
expression of softness and gracefulness is combined with that of
mathematical symmetry and precision.

In a snow _storm_ the force of the wind and the intensity of the cold
usually change all this. The progress of the crystallization, which to
be perfect must take place slowly, and under the condition of perfect
repose, is at once hastened by the low temperature, and disturbed by the
commotion in the air. Across the broad expanse of open plains, along
mountain-sides, through groves of trees, and over the smooth surface of
frozen lakes and rivers, millions of misshapen and broken crystals are
driven by the wind, piled up in heaps, or accumulated in confused masses
under the lee of every obstruction, having been subjected on the way to
such violence of agitation and collision that the characteristic beauty
and symmetry of the material is entirely destroyed.

If we examine attentively the falling flakes, whether of snow _showers_
or of snow _storms_, at different times, under the varying circumstances
in which snow forms and descends, we shall be surprised at the number
and variety of the forms which they assume. They may be received and
examined upon any black surface--the crown of a hat, or a piece of black
cloth, for example--previously cooled below the freezing-point. At any
one time the crystallizations are usually alike, but different
snow-falls seem to have each its own special conformation. Sometimes,
however, a change takes place from one style of flake to another in the
course of the same storm or shower, and during the period of transition
both varieties fall together from the air. Persons interested in such
observations may easily make drawings with a pen of the different forms
that present themselves from time to time, and thus in the course of a
winter make a very curious and interesting collection.

The number and variety of the forms which the snowy crystallizations
assume seem greatest in the polar regions, and the celebrated scientific
navigator Scoresby studied them there with great attention during his
various arctic voyages. He made drawings of ninety-six different forms,
and the number has been increased since, by more recent observers, to
several hundred.

It will be observed that all the forms have a hexagonal character. They
consist of a star of six rays, or a plate of six angles. There is a
reason for this, or rather there is a well-known property of ice in
respect to the law of its crystallization which throws some light upon
the subject. The law is this: that whereas every crystallizable
substance has its own primitive crystalline form, that of ice is a
rhomboid with angles of 60 deg. and 120 deg., and consequently all the
secondary forms which this substance assumes are controlled by these
angles, and derive from them their hexagonal character.

The most striking of the methods adopted for the inspection of ice
crystals is one discovered by Professor Tyndall, and consists of melting
the ice from _within_. This is done by means of a lens, by which the
sun's rays are brought to a focus within the mass of ice, so as to
liquefy a portion of it in the interior without disturbing that at the
surface.

NETTIE'S VALENTINE.

BY AGNES CARR.


"They are all so lovely, I hardly know which to choose," said Nettie
Almer to herself, as she paused at the entrance of a large stationer's
shop to gaze in at the window, where was spread a tempting display of
valentines of all kinds and sizes, from the rich, expensive ones in
handsome embossed boxes to the cheap penny pictures strung on a line
across the entire casement.

"I want them to be the prettiest ones there," continued Nettie to
herself, and she gave her little pocket-book a squeeze inside her muff
as she thought of the bright two dollar and a half gold piece which
Uncle John had given her that morning to spend all for valentines; for
Nettie was invited that evening to a large party, given by one of her
school-mates, and after supper a post-office was to be opened, through
which all her class were to send valentines to each other. Great fun was
anticipated, while at the same time there was considerable rivalry as to
who should send the handsomest missives, and at school nothing else had
been talked of amongst the scholars for a week.

"Please, miss, buy just a little bunch." The words sounded close to
Nettie's ear, and she turned to encounter a pair of pleading blue eyes
gazing into hers, while the plaintive voice repeated, "Please buy a
little bunch of flowers; I haven't sold one to-day, and Minna wants an
orange so much."

It was a pitiful little figure that stood there, with an old shawl over
her head, and her feet hardly protected from the icy pavement by a pair
of miserable ragged shoes, while the tiny hands, purple with cold, held
a small pine board on which were fastened small bouquets of rose-buds,
violets, and other flowers, which she tried to sell to the passers-by,
most of whom, however, pushed her rudely aside or passed indifferently
by.

"Who is Minna?" asked Nettie, gently, after a moment's survey of the
little girl.

"She is mine sister, and she is so bad, so very bad, with the fever. She
cried all last night with thirst, and begged me to bring her an orange
to cool her tongue. Please, miss, buy some of my flowers."

Nettie's tender heart was touched, and her eyes filled with tears in
sympathy with the poor child, who was now crying bitterly. "Has she been
sick very long?" she asked.

"Oh yes; and the Herr Doctor says she will die if she does not have wine
to strengthen her. But where could we get wine? The mother can hardly
pay the rent, and I sell flowers to buy bread; but I can only make two
or three cents on a bunch, and some bad days they fade before I can get
rid of them; so I'm afraid Minna must die. But please give me enough to
get her an orange."

"An orange! of course I will," exclaimed Nettie; "and more than one.
Come with me;" and she caught the child eagerly by the hand, and drew
her toward the street. At this moment, however, her eye fell on the
valentines in the window, and she stopped, hesitating. Should she give
up the pretty gifts for her little friends, and lose half of the
evening's anticipated enjoyment, or should she let this poor girl--of
whose existence she was ignorant five minutes before--go home
empty-handed to her sick sister? There was an instant of sharp conflict
as she thought of how mean she should appear in her school-mates' eyes,
and then, with a resolute air, Nettie turned her back on the fascinating
window, and conducted the little flower girl to a fruit store near at
hand.

A basket was supplied by the kind-hearted proprietor of the store, to
whom Nettie explained what she wanted, and this she filled with golden
Havana oranges and rich clusters of white grapes--a delicious basketful
for a feverish invalid. This, Nettie found, took nearly half the money,
and the remainder she gave to the grocer, begging him to get her a
bottle of the best sherry wine, which was quickly done, and added to the
basket.

"Now," she said, turning to her poor companion, who had stood meanwhile,
hardly believing the evidence of her eyes, "take me home with you, and
we will carry these to Minna right away."

"Oh, miss, thou art too heavenly kind! It will save Minna; she need not
die now." And with smiles chasing away the tears, the happy child took
hold of one side of the basket, while Nettie carried the other, and
together they wended their way to a poor tenement-house in a dark narrow
street, and climbed the rickety stairs to a back room on the fourth
floor.

As they pushed open the door, a low moan was heard from within, and a
weak voice asked, "Gretel, is it thou? Hast thou brought the orange?"

Gretel sprang to the bedside, and in an eager voice exclaimed: "Oh,
Minna, yes, yes, I have the oranges, and so much more! See this good
little lady, and what she has brought thee. Look! oranges--grapes--wine!
Oh, Minna, sweetheart, thou wilt soon be well now!"

The pale child, reclining among the pillows, her golden hair brushed
back from a brow on which the blue veins showed painfully distinct,
stretched forth a thin little hand for the grapes, and said to Nettie,
"Oh, I have dreamed of fruit like this; thou art an angel to bring it to
me."

Gently Nettie brushed back the fair hair of the little patient, and
pressed the cool grapes to her parched lips, while Gretel poured some of
the wine into a cracked tumbler, and administered it to the sick girl,
who, being too weak to talk much, soon sank into a quiet, refreshing
slumber, with one of Nettie's hands clasped tightly in both her own; and
as Nettie sat by the humble pallet she felt fully repaid for the loss of
her valentines.

And Minna still slept when the German mother entered, who, after
listening to Gretel's whispered story, exclaimed, as Nettie rose to
depart, and stole softly from the room: "May Gott in Himmel bless thee,
young lady, for what thou hast done this day! It is weeks since my Minna
has slept like that." And throwing her apron over her head, the poor
woman burst into happy tears.

It was with a light heart that Nettie tripped homeward, and she never
even glanced at the great window where the brilliant hearts and Cupids
gleamed as gayly as ever in the bright sunlight.

"Well, Pussie, how many valentines have you bought?" asked Uncle John,
meeting Nettie in the hall as she entered the house.

"Only one; but it was a very nice one, and you mustn't ask any
questions," answered Nettie, with a blush, as she ran up stairs to avoid
further questioning.

It was rather trying, though, when evening came, and Nettie, dressed in
her white dress and blue ribbons, stood among the other girls in the
dressing-room, and they all crowded round inquiring how many valentines
she had for the post-office, to be obliged to confess that she had none,
and to hear the whispered comments of, "How mean!" "I didn't think that
of Nettie Almer."

She kept her spirits up, however, by thinking of Minna, and the joy of
her mother and sister, and soon forgot the valentines entirely, while
dancing and joining in the merry games with which the first part of the
evening was passed.

But after supper the mortification and almost regretful feelings
returned, when the other children drew forth mysterious packages, and
confided them to Mrs. Hope, the mother of the young hostess; and she was
becoming quite unhappy when a servant entered, saying some one wished to
see Miss Nettie Almer.

Gladly she hastened from the room; but what was her surprise when a
messenger handed her a box addressed to "Nettie, from St. Valentine, in
return for the valentine she sent Minna and Gretel."

On removing the lid, the box was found to contain a dozen small bouquets
of sweet, fragrant flowers, and a card saying they were intended as
valentines for her little friends. Nettie shrewdly suspected them to be
the same bouquets Gretel had tried so unavailingly to sell in the
morning; but she did not know that Uncle John had been an unobserved
spectator of the little episode in front of the stationer's, and that he
had made a later call at the humble tenement, and gladdened the poor
family a second time that day by buying all Gretel's flowers, and paying
a good price for them, too.

It was with very much happier feelings that Nettie re-entered the
parlor, and handed in her contribution for the letter-box; and when the
office was opened in the back drawing-room, and Mr. Hope, disguised as
St. Valentine, distributed the mail, all said none of the valentines
could equal Nettie's, for in the centre of each bouquet was hidden a
tiny golden heart, inclosing a motto appropriate to the occasion.

Nettie always said that that 14th of February was the happiest day she
had ever spent; and it was also a turning-point in the fortunes of the
German family, for Mrs. Almer having heard from Uncle John of her little
daughter's _proteges_, interested some of her friends in them, who gave
work to the mother, and when summer came, found a pleasant cottage on a
farm for them in the country; and with the mother now happy and hopeful,
Gretel well clad and rosy, and Minna quite restored to health, they were
sent away from the dark, dreary tenement to a happy home among "green
fields and pastures fair." And it all came about through Nettie's
valentine.




AUNT SUKEY'S FIRST SLEIGH-RIDE.


"Oh, Nan, look how the snow comes down! I thought it would never snow at
all this winter. Just look at it! Now that's what I call tip-top," said
Tom Chandler, gazing at the fast-whitening landscape, and drumming a
cheerful tattoo on the window-panes with his fingers.

For some time the children stood in silence, watching the snow-flakes as
they whirled and danced and floated like so many feathers, only to fall
and pile up and cover the brown earth and the bare branches as with a
lovely mantle of swan's-down.

Suddenly a thought seemed to have entered Tom's curly head, and he broke
the silence with an air of profound mystery, saying: "I say, Nan, can
you keep a secret? Well, look square in my face and say, 'Upon my word
and sacred honor, I'll never, never, never tell anybody what Tom's going
to tell me!' There! do you think you could keep it? It's the awfulest
jolliest thing you ever heard of."

"Why, Tom," returned Nan, with dignity, "did I ever tell anybody
anything that is a secret when you told me not to? Now do tell me this
one."

"Let me see, now; haven't you told lots of my secrets, madam? Who went
and told pa about my painting the white gobbler's feathers black, hey?
Who told about my putting the mouse into Aunt Sukey's soup? Who told
about my tying the clothes-line across the grass last summer? Who told
about my--"

"That's real mean; you know I couldn't help it, ma was so vexed. You can
keep your old secret; I won't listen to it--there!"

Seeing there was danger of one of Nan's showers, as Tom called her
sudden tears, that young gentleman lowering his voice said, soothingly,
"Never mind, old girl; just say, ''Pon honor' once more, and that you
will never tell if you are shot for it, and I'll tell you what it is."

"That's what I call a solemn promise," exclaimed Tom, as Nanny concluded
the prescribed speech. "Well, here goes!"

Just what was said in Nan's ear we may never know, but that it was
pleasing to both parties may be judged by what followed. The moment the
grand secret became the property of two, there was such a clapping of
hands, and whooping and laughing, and such a dancing up and down the
room as made the boards tremble, and brought old Aunt Susan from her
realms in the kitchen to the dining-room door.

"Bress de Lor', chillun, what dose yer mean cuttin' up like dat! yous'll
bring de roof down, an' no mistake! Stop dat noise! I guess yese
disremember dere's comp'ny in de spare room yonder, gettin' ready fo'
tea."

"Now you never mind the company, Aunt Sukey. Nan and I are only
practicing a war jig we've got to dance for Miss Almira to-night."

"Drat your war jigs, an' 'have like 'spectable chillun! Ring de
tea-bell, and make you'selves useful; you's got younger bones dan dis
ole Susan, tank de Lor'!"

"Remember!" said Tom, with a warning gesture to Nan, for he heard
footsteps coming.

The next morning after breakfast Tom walked into the kitchen, where Aunt
Sukey was putting the finishing touches to a dozen or more pies, for it
was baking-day.

"Look here, Aunt Susan," exclaimed the youngster, "I've heard you say
how much you would like to see 'Marse Linkum,' haven't I? Well, you've
never had a sleigh-ride since you come North, have you? And I was just
thinking last night that I'd take you for one when Nan and I go to
school this morning. There! it won't take more'n a few minutes. Get your
hood and shawl, and come along; it's only beyond Deacon Johnson's. Marse
Lincoln would like to see you first-rate."

"Oh, bress de Lor', honey, who tole you dat? Has ole aunty libbed to lay
her eyes on de savior ob her people? Yous two dun wait for ole Aunt
Susan, and she'll be wid you in a jiffy."

"Hurry up! Jocko's waiting," screamed Tom, as the old lady bustled off
to get her "fixin's."

"But, Tom, what'll ma say? and she's got company, too," asked Nan,
uneasily.

"Why, it's all the better for our fun. She'll have some one to help her.
Miss Almira can turn to and do up the pies and things, and make herself
useful as well as ornamental."

The war of the great rebellion was nearly over, and the old woman, like
many of her people, had made her way North, and this was her first
winter; so Tom and Nan expected great sport over her new experience--a
sleigh-ride. With considerable trouble, for aunty was stout and
unwieldy, and the little cutter was narrow and high, she was at last
bundled in, Nan and Tom following, to the infinite satisfaction of
Jocko, the pony, which was pawing the snow and jingling his bells
impatiently.

[Illustration: "AWAY THEY RUSHED DOWN THE LANE."]

When the robes were all tucked in, Tom gave the word, and away they
rushed down the lane into the road. Speeding on, they turned a curve so
sharply that Aunt Sukey was wild with alarm; her eyes rolled, and her
teeth glistened from ear to ear, as, with mouth distended, she screamed,
"Oh, Marse Tommy, fo' de Lor's sake, hole in dat beast! I's done gone
an' bin a fool to trust my mutton to a hoss like dat! Oh, Marse Tommy,
Massa Tommy, yous'll be de deff of ole Aunt Susan! Oh, fo' de Lor's
sake, stop 'im!"

"Hooray, Jocko! go it, old boy!" was Tommy's laughing response.

"Oh, bress us an' save us! Missy Nanny, be a good chile, an' make Marse
Tom stop dat yere beast, or we'll be upsot, an' break ebbery bone in our
bodies!"

"Don't mind, aunty. Jocko knows every step of the way, and _we_ won't
let you get hurt," cried Nan, with a patronizing air.

"O Lor' hab mussy on a poor ole niggur, an' bring her safely to her
journey's end, for mussy dese chillun hab none!" ejaculated Aunt Susan,
as another sharp curve was so rapidly turned that the very trees and
fences seemed rushing madly away in an opposite direction.

In less than twenty minutes, and the minutes seemed ages to affrighted
Susan, Jocko, with a snort and an extra jingle of his bells, stood
stock-still in front of the school-house.

A score of eyes peeped from the windows as Tom, alighting, with mock
ceremony handed out Nan and Aunt Susan, exclaiming, "Ladies, we shall
soon be in the presence of 'Marse Linkum.'"

"Oh, tank de Lor', dar's no bones broken! and we's really gwine to see
de blessed Marse Linkum, arter all!"

"There, now, Nan, take Aunt Susan up on the stoop, till I blanket Jocko
and put him in the shed."

"Now, Missy Nan," whispered Aunt Susan, when they found themselves alone
on the piazza, "does I look 'spectable nuff to see de President?"

"You look awful nice, aunty," replied Nanny, turning away her head to
conceal her laughter. "Ah! here comes Tom."

"Now, Aunt Susan," exclaimed that youngster, "when I introduce you, say
this: 'I hope I find your Excellency well, and all the people of color
in the South send you greeting.'"

"Wa'al, now, what a genius dat chile is, to be shuah!" muttered Susan,
walking behind Tom and Nanny.

"Mr. Lincoln," exclaimed Tom, advancing toward that gentleman, with a
merry twinkle in his roguish eyes, "allow me to present to you a new
pupil, Aunt Susan Whittingham; she has come all the way from Louisiana
to see you."

"Oh, bress de Lor' dat hab given dis ole woman de privilege ob laying
her eyes on de gloriousness ob de man who hab saved all her people, an'
has strucken off de chains what held dem fast, an' made dem free
forebber and forebber! Hallelujah! hallelujah! amen! Oh, bress me, I's
done gone an' make a mistake arter all. Oh, your Presidency--no, your
Elegancy, I hopes I find you well. All de people ob color in de Souf
send you--send you--greetin'!"

"Aunt Susan, I am very sorry; but that little rascal, Tom, has been
deceiving you all the time. I'm not the 'Marse Linkum' you take me for,
I'm sorry to tell you, for I am only plain James Lincoln, school-master
of the district. Tom, I say, how did you dare to treat Aunt Susan and
myself in this way? I have a mind to punish you."

"Oh, de Lor' forgib Marse Tommy dat he fool a 'spectable ole body like
me; an' de Lor' save me! all my pies an' tings goin' to construction,
an' de missus all alone to hum wid comp'ny! It's too much--it's too much
fo' shuah!"

"Come, aunty," cried Tom, soothingly, for he was beginning to be afraid
himself, "we'll drive home ever so slow. Come, now, forgive us, and
don't get us a whipping."

"I's mos' ready to forgib yous now; but jes you disremember how de
chillun in de Bible war eaten up along o' de bars for sayin', 'Go up,
ole bal'-head!' an' don't you nebber, nebber agin fool ole Aunt Susan."

Almira had "turned to," as Tom predicted, and was helping his mother
with the dinner, when that lady exclaimed: "This is another of that
boy's tricks; but boys are boys, and there's no help for it. I hope Aunt
Susan's enjoying the ride."

Everything was in "apple-pie order" when the party returned, apparently
in fine spirits. Tom thought it mighty queer that nothing was said about
his escapade, and dying to tell it, he felt his way cautiously for an
opportunity, and it came. In the evening, when the family were
discussing nuts and cider around the glowing fire, he related the
morning's adventure with such gay good humor that Pa and Ma Chandler and
Augustus and Almira made the walls ring again with their laughter,
bringing old Aunt Susan to the sitting-room door, where, poking her head
in, she had courage to say, "'Pears to me yous folks is havin' great
sport over Aunt Susan's fust sleigh-ride."




[Illustration: RUINS OF TRINITY CHURCH, 1776.]

NEW YORK'S FIRST GREAT FIRE.


The first great fire in New York happened in September, 1776, just after
Washington had been driven from the city. New York was then a small but
beautiful town; it reached only to the lower end of the Park, but
Broadway was lined with shade trees, and its fine houses stretched away
on both sides to the Battery. Trinity Church stood, as now, at the head
of Wall Street. St. Paul's--a building of great cost and beauty for the
times--almost bounded the upper end of Broadway. The British soldiers
marched into the pleasant but terrified city, the leading patriots fled
with Washington's army, and in the hot days of the autumn of 1776 New
York seemed to offer a pleasant home for the officers and men of the
invading forces. They took possession of the deserted country-seats of
the patriots at Bloomingdale or Murray Hill, and occupied the finest
houses on the best streets of the town. Here they hoped to pass a winter
of ease, and in the spring complete without difficulty the rout of the
disheartened Americans.

But one night in September the cry of fire was heard, and the flames
began to spread from some low wooden buildings near Whitehall, where now
are the Produce Exchange and Staten Island ferries. In those days there
were no steam-engines nor hydrants, no Croton water nor well-organized
fire-companies. But as the flames continued to advance, the British
soldiers sprang from their beds and began to labor to check the fire
with all the means in their power. They used, no doubt, buckets of water
brought from the cisterns and the river. They found, it was said,
several persons setting houses on fire, and in their rage threw them
into the flames. But their labor was all in vain. All night the fire
spread over the finest quarter of New York. From Whitehall it passed up
Broadway on the eastern side, devouring everything, until it was stopped
by a large new brick house near Wall Street. It crossed to the western
side, and laid nearly the whole street in ruins. It fastened on the roof
and tower of Trinity Church, and soon, of all its graceful proportions,
only a few shattered fragments remained. Then the flames passed rapidly
up to the west of Broadway from Trinity as far as St. Paul's; houses and
shops crumbled before them; a long array of buildings seem to have fed
the raging fires, until at last they reached the walls of the great
church itself, and were about to envelop it in ruins. But here, it is
said, the zeal of the people checked their progress. They mounted the
roof of the church, covered it with streams of water, put out the sparks
that fell on it, until at last the building was saved, the flames died
out, and St. Paul's stands to-day almost as it stood in 1776, the
monument of the close of the great fire.

It is not difficult to imagine the melancholy change wrought in the
appearance of the city. Broadway, once so beautiful, remained until the
end of the war in great part a street of ruins. From Wall Street to the
Battery, from St. Paul's Church to the Bowling Green, the miserable
waste was never repaired. Up its desolate track paraded each morning the
British officers and their followers, shining in red and gold, to the
sound of martial music; but they had no leisure nor wish to repair the
ravages of war. On the wasted district arose a collection of tents and
hovels, called "Canvas Town." Here lived the miserable poor, the
wretched, the vile; robbers who at night made the ruins unsafe, and
incendiaries who never ceased to terrify the unlucky city. The British
garrison was never suffered to remain long at ease.

It was said that the great fire of 1776 was the work of the patriots,
who had resolved to burn New York, and drive the invaders from their
safe resting-place. The question of its origin has never been decided.
It may have been altogether accidental, or possibly the work of design.
But it was followed by a singular succession of other fires, during the
period of the British ascendency, that seem to show some settled plan to
annoy and discourage the invaders. The newspapers of the time are filled
with accounts of the misfortunes of the garrison and the royalists.

     I would like to know how old is the festival of St. Valentine's
     Day. I have painted some little cards myself, and am going to send
     them to my school-mates. I think that is better than buying them,
     even if I can not make them quite so pretty. I am going to copy a
     little verse on the back of each one. Mamma has chosen the verses
     for me.

There is no clear record of the origin of St. Valentine's Day. St.
Valentine himself was a priest of Rome who was martyred some time during
the third century, but he had nothing to do with the peculiar observance
of his day. In ancient Rome a great part of the month of February was
devoted to feasts in honor of Pan and Juno, during which the young men
drew by lot the name of their companion for the festivities. It is
supposed that this ancient custom changed gradually into the present
observance of the day. Many allusions to St. Valentine's Day are found
in English poetry of the earliest date, as the festival was much more
generally observed four centuries ago than now.

     I am a little boy eight years old. I want to tell you that papa

     her. Poor Susie!

The little bluebird must have left its winter-quarters in the Southern
States, and travelled with the warm wave which swept northward in
January. It is to be hoped it will escape being frozen to death, and
live to sing its sweet spring song at a more seasonable time.

     As you have asked us to write about household pets, I thought I
     would tell you about a pet fish we kept in a stone basin about
     three feet square and two feet deep. We caught the fish in Cross
     Creek, and brought it home in a bucket, and placed it in the basin.
     It was a yellow bass about ten inches long and very pretty. It soon
     got very tame, and would take a fishing-worm out of my fingers. It
     committed suicide one night by jumping out on the floor and killing
     itself. I have a sunfish in the basin now, but I don't expect it
     will ever get so tame. There are four or five pretty redbirds
     staying in our yard, and lots of snowbirds.

     In YOUNG PEOPLE No. 11 there is an article on the Dead-letter
     Office at Washington which mentions some curious things to go
     through the mail. There are three more very queer things I would
     like to mention. The first is two centipedes, which are on the
     shelf with the snake; the second is an iron hitching post; and the
     third is a live alligator about a foot and a half long. There is an
     old record in the office of 1778, which lasted at that time eleven
     years, but which, a clerk said, would last now about fifteen

It consists of a series of stories, embracing the whole of the events in
the life of our Blessed Lord, told in a plain, simple style, suited to
the capacities of children of seven or eight years of age. But better
still, all good children's books are good for adults; and this will be
found equally useful to put into the hands of very ignorant grown-up
people, who may from this learn the story of man's redemption in an
intelligent manner. Many of the lessons are illustrated with pictures of
the places mentioned.

"This little work," says the author, "has received the distinguished
honor of being appointed to be one of the class-books of the Samoan
Collegians, and has been made to subserve the highest of all
purposes--the preaching of the Gospel. To that purpose it is adapted
when the hearers are untaught, untrained, and unreflecting. Each lesson
can be understood by those who have no previous knowledge, and each is
calculated to be the first address to one who has never before heard of
God or his Christ."

It is a capital book for boys. * * * The stories it contains are
full of the kind of novelty, peril, and adventure which are so
fascinating.--_Spectator_, London.

These stories are entertaining and are well told, and they are
calculated to impart much knowledge of natural history to youthful
readers.--_Boston Traveller._

The amount of enjoyment that was afforded to the children by the
previous work of this author, "Stories of the Gorilla Country," is
beyond computation. * * * We have read every word of "Wild Life under
the Equator" with the liveliest interest and satisfaction. No ingenious
youth of twelve in the land will find it more "awfully jolly" than did
we.--_N. Y. Evening Post._

In this book Mr. Du Chaillu relates the story of his sojourn in Apingi
Land, of which he was elected king by the kind-hearted and hospitable
natives. * * * We assure the reader that it is full of stirring
incidents and exciting adventures. Many chapters are exceedingly
humorous, and others are quite instructive. The chapter, for instance,
on the habits of the white and tree ants contains an interesting
contribution to natural history.--_N. Y. Herald._

WIGGLES.


Here are some of the answers to the Wiggle published in No. 10 of
HARPER'S YOUNG PEOPLE. So many were sent in that it was impossible to
publish them all, and so our artist selected those that he considered
the best. Those that he used were sent in by J. R. S., J. B. G., M. E.,
A. T. Jones, Paul, D. C. Gilmore, H. and B., and Bert W. S., several of
whom sent a number of different figures.

Others, and some of them very good, were sent in by W. B. B., Ethel M.,
S. A. W., Jun., John Peddle, C. F., Nettie S. H., Willie H. S., Mabel
M., E. H. S., Hetty, M. Ward, Philip M., Amenio E. A., Willy H.,
H. W. P., J. L., Mary P., Archie H. L., C. B. F., R. S. M., W. A. Burr,
Percy B. M., Paul. B. T., E. S., C. F. C., Gracie C., Eva M., and Anita
R. N. Figure No. 8 is what our artist made of the Wiggle; and Figure No.
9 is a new Wiggle in two parts, which must be combined in one drawing,
though they must retain their relative positions.




THE LONG-EARED BAT.


      A long-eared bat
      Went to buy a hat.
  Said the hatter, "I've none that will do,
      Unless with the shears
      I shorten your ears,
  Which might be unpleasant to you."

      The long-eared bat
      Was so mad at that
  He flew over lands and seas,
      Till in Paris (renowned
      For its fashions) he found
  A hat that he wore with great ease.

=Another Sagacious Dog.=--In No. 11 of HARPER'S YOUNG PEOPLE a story was
told of a sagacious newspaper dog. Having read this, a Western editor
sends the following story of his dog, in which he says: "My dog is a
beautiful Gordon setter, and has been so well trained that while the
carrier is delivering papers on one side of the street, Bob, the dog,
delivers on the other. He receives his papers folded, half a dozen at a
time, and going to the first place, lays the whole bundle down, and then
picks it up, all but one, and so on till they are all gone."

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
