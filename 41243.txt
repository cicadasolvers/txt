                       BROOKS'S READERS, FIRST YEAR.


The sole purpose of this book is to help the children to learn to read.
While it may ultimately lead to the acquisition of knowledge concerning
many subjects, its present aim is only to make reading easy. The
lessons are, therefore, on subjects familiar to every child. The words
are such as children habitually use in conversation; they are
introduced gradually, and as a rule are repeated many times. Since
proficiency in reading is best attained by much practice, care has been
taken to present as large an amount as possible of interesting matter
which the child can readily master. Every line is for the pupil to
read. The stories are so constructed as to encourage and secure
naturalness of expression without the intervention of rules or formal
drills. The gradation both in thought and in expression is easy and
natural.

Although the learning of words by much repetition and familiarity with
their forms is an essential feature of this book, its foundation is
nevertheless phonetic. Yet, for the sake of leaving it perfectly
adaptable to any method of teaching, the phonetic basis has not been
emphasized. The systematic introduction of words which may serve as
key-words for the acquisition of others containing similar phonetic
elements has been carefully observed, and it is believed that this is
the natural method untrammeled by any artificial classification.

As further aids toward making the child's first reading lessons easy,
the sentences are short. There are no broken lines in the first hundred
pages. Indentations help the young reader to keep the place. There are
no interfering illustrations in the text. Each story is complete
without turning a leaf.

Grateful acknowledgments are extended to Miss Frances Lilian Taylor of
Galesburg, Illinois, to Mr. W. J. Button of Chicago, and to Miss
Matilda Mitchell, primary teacher, Phillips Brooks School, Boston, for
valuable suggestions and assistance.




SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS


As stated on the preceding page, the foundation of this work is
phonetic. The author believes that children may profitably learn many
words without reference to their phonetic composition, and that among
these certain key-words should be selected from which the elementary
sounds of the language may be developed. These elements will give the
pupils the power of acquiring new words. For example, observe the
following key-words and the sounds developed from them:--

  [**Transcriber's Note:
    To represent the diacritical marks used in the text, square brackets
    have been used to enclose a letter and a symbol. The symbol precedes
    the letter to represent a symbol above the letter, and follows the
    letter to represent a mark below the letter.
      [)x] - a letter with a breve above it,
      [x+] - a letter with an up tack (upside down "T") under it,
      [=x] - a letter with a macron above it,
      [~x] - a letter with a tilde above it,
      [.x] - a letter with a dot above it,
      [x:] - a letter with a diaresis under it.

    The "$" signs are used to represent bold typeface.]

Observe the great number of easy and common words that may be developed
from the sounds thus learned from the first ten key-words named above.
The list includes _an_, _as_, _ran_, _had_, _pan_, _man_, _tan_, _let_,
_met_, _pet_, _bet_, _men_, _pen_, _fig_, _did_, _bit_, _little_,
_not_, _lot_, _got_, _hot_, _log_, and a great many more. Similar
key-words emphasizing the remaining sounds should be selected as the
work proceeds. Teachers preferring to introduce the sounds less
rapidly, may teach these first words as words and select others later
in the book to serve as key-words. The blackboard should be in constant
use, and the pupils' ingenuity in forming new words and new sentences
should be tested at every recitation. The few exercises in script given
at the beginning of the book are suggestive of the manner in which much
additional drill in reading may be presented on the blackboard. The
diacritical marks should not be taught to the children.

        The birds drink it.
        Don drinks it.
    How do birds drink?
    How do dogs drink?
        Soon we must go home.
        Mother will call and we must go.
        We can not stay here all the time.
    The birds sing in the trees by the brook.
    The rabbits come to see the water.
    Don must not catch the rabbits.

     why said was went did him his guess shining fish

    One day Ned went down to the brook.
    No one went with him.
    The sky was blue. No cloud was in sight.
    The sun was shining bright.
    It was a fine day.
        Why did Ned go to the brook?
        Did he go to get some flowers?
    I think not. I will tell you all about it.
    His mother said to him:
    "Where are you going, Ned?"
        "I am going to the brook," said Ned.
    "What are you going to do there?"
        "Oh, I am going to catch some fish.
        I will catch some for you, mother."
    "Oh, Ned, do not catch all the fish."

[Illustration]

    Did you catch five fish for mother?

      It is too little.
    Here are the chairs.
    Come, now, sit down by the table.
    The baby may sit here by me.

      Is it something you have bought for me?

    Yes, Grace, it is a picture.
    See! I bought it for you.
    Don't you think it is pretty?
        Oh, I thought it was a picture.
        It is a picture of a bird and a nest.
    Yes, it is a picture of a robin.
    The robin is by its nest.
        The nest is high in a big tree.
        There are four eggs in the nest.
    The eggs are blue.
    They are as blue as the sky.
        This is a pretty picture, Marian.
        I am glad you brought it to me.

        The cow gives milk for us.
        She eats the grass by the brook.
        She walks under the trees.
    She sees many red and yellow flowers.
    She hears the wind roar in the tree tops.
    She hears the robin sing.
        Come here, old cow.
        Why do you stand in the brook?
        Why do you walk in the grass?
    The cow will not tell me.
    She looks at me. She does not talk.

    Why do they come home at night?
    I think Ned will drive them home.

    "I have," said the bee;
    And it went into a flower.
    "I have," said the little yellow chicken;
    And it ran under its mother's wing.

        We read and we write.
        We look at the pretty pictures.
        We sing about the flowers.
    Is that all you do, Ned?
        Oh, no, no. It is not all.
        I can't tell you everything we do.

    See how fast the water runs.
    Stand still and hear the brook sing.
        I hear it, I hear it.
        What does it say when it sings?
    It says: I am a little brook.
    I run, and I sing as I run.
    I give water to the trees and the grass.
    I give water to the pretty white lily.
    The cows come to see me.
    I give them water to drink.
    The robins sing to me every morning.
    The flowers love me.
      Why do you run all the time, little brook?
      Where are you going this fine day?
    I am running to the sea.
    I run, and still I am always here.
      Boys and girls like to play by the brook.
      They find many pretty things.
      Can you tell what they find?
    I think they sometimes find a flower.
    Sometimes they catch a fish in the brook.
      Good-by, little brook!
      We will see you again.

OUR HOME


    Good morning, Bennie.
    Is Marian at home?
        Yes, Rose, I think she is in the house.
        Will you go in?
    What a pretty home you have!
    What is Marian doing this morning?
        She is reading in her new book.
        She will be glad to see you.
    I love my home.
    There is no place like it.
    Do you know why I think so?
        Father and mother live here.
        Sister and brother live here.
        Our baby lives here.
        I love them all.
        They all love me.
    There is a pretty song about home.
    We sing it at school.
    Did you ever hear it?
        Oh, yes. Shall I sing it to you?
          "Home, home, sweet, sweet home!
          Be it ever so humble,
          There is no place like home."
    Now, is not that a pretty song?
    Every child loves to sing it.

    I like to walk through the woods.
    I like to see the tall trees.
        Some of these trees are large.
        Some are small.
    What are trees good for, Robert?
    Tell me all about them.
        They are good for wood.
        We build houses of wood.
    Oh, yes; I know.

    They sing him to sleep at night.
    Sometimes there is a storm at sea.
    Then the wind and the waves roar.
        Jack likes to hear them roar.
        He likes to see the big waves.
    Sometimes Jack sails out with his father.
    They go out in a boat to catch fish.
        The wind blows the white sails.
        The boat sails far away.
    At night they come home.
    How many fish did you catch, Jack?
    How far did you go? What did you see?
        Is not Jack a fine sailor boy?

REVIEW


    Where do you live, Grace?
       I live at home, sir.
       I live with mother and father.
    Where do the robins live?
       They live in the old tree in the woods.
       The tree is their home.
    Where do fishes live?
       Some live in the brook, some in the sea.
    What has wings but can not fly?
       I think it must be a little chicken.
    What can fly but has no wings?
       I know, I know. It is Ned's kite.
    What runs all day but has no feet?
       It must be the clock in our room.
    I think it is the brook.
       Oh, no, it is a train of cars.

LITTLE BOPEEP


    My name is Bopeep.
    Do you see all my sheep and lambs?
    I take care of them.
    I find grass and water for them.
        One day I lost my pretty sheep.
        I could not find them any where.
    How did Bopeep find her sheep?
    I will tell you how she found them.
        She looked here, she looked there.
        She went down to the brook.
        No sheep were there.
        She called and called.
        She stood still to listen.
        She heard not a sheep.
    Bopeep sat down on the grass.
    The birds sang to her.
    The brook sang to the birds.
    Then little Bopeep went to sleep.
        The sheep and lambs came running.
        They came out of the woods.
    "Here we are, little Bopeep," they said.
    "We have come back to you.
    We have come to live with you again."
    Little Bopeep looked up.
    She saw her sheep and lambs.
    All had come back to her.
    How glad she was to see them!
        They drank the water from the brook.
        They ate the green grass.
        The lambs played under the trees.
    "Oh, my pretty lambs!" said little Bopeep.

THE SNOW


One morning in winter Grace heard her mother calling her.

"Come here, Grace! Come here, and look out of the window."

Grace ran to the window and looked out. What do you think she saw?

The snow was falling.

The ground was white with snow.

"Oh, mother," said Grace, "how pretty it is! Everything is white with
snow.

Where does the snow come from?"

"It falls from the clouds," said her mother. "In summer the clouds bring
rain. In winter they bring snow."

[Illustration]

At school the boys and girls were glad.

"It snows! It snows!" they said.

"Now we shall have a fine time.

We can make snowballs.

We can ride on our sleds.

We can play in the snow."

         Some day it will come home again.
         It will come home to baby and me.
    Many pretty things are in my ship.
    It is full of bright playthings.
    They are all for baby and me.
         Oh, my pretty ship!
         All its sails are of silk.
         Its masts are of yellow gold.
         It sails all day and all night.
    When it comes back, how happy I shall be.
    But now it is sailing on the blue sea.

THE BIRDS IN WINTER


One morning Marian looked out of her window. The snow was falling.

"How cold the wind blows," she said.

"The trees are all frozen and bare. The brook is frozen over.

The pretty robin's nest is full of snow. There are no birds in the
woods. Where do the birds go when winter comes?"

"They fly to the sunny South, where the snow does not come," said
Robert.

"They will come back to us in the spring. They will sing glad songs and
build new nests."

[Illustration]

Out in the snow a little bird was hopping.

"See, Robert, see!" said Marian. "That little bird did not fly to the
sunny South.

"How cold it must be! Its little feet must be frozen."

"That is a snowbird," said Robert. "It likes the snow. It does not mind
the cold. It stays here all winter."

LITTLE BOY BLUE


"Oh, Ned," said Rose one day, "what do you think I have? It is a new
story book. Father gave it to me this morning. I have been reading in
it."

"It is a pretty book," said Ned. "Are there any good stories in it?"

"Oh, yes. One story is about a little boy who went to sleep in the
meadow.

I don't know what his name was, but they called him Little Boy Blue.

He took care of the sheep and the cows. He had a horn to blow.

The sheep and the cows would come when they heard the horn."

[Illustration]

"Here is the story, now. And here is the picture of Little Boy Blue.

    "Little Boy Blue,
      Come, blow your horn!
    The sheep are in the meadow,
      The cows are in the corn.

Where, where can the little boy be? Oh, here he is, sleeping, don't you
see?"

DRIVING THE COWS


Robert lives on a farm.

His father is a farmer.

Robert helps his father. He helps take care of the chickens and the
lambs.

Sometimes he drives the cows to the meadow. Sometimes he drives them
home at night.

"Where are the cows, Robert?"

"I think they are in the meadow."

"Will you not drive them home? It is time to milk them."

"Yes, father, I will bring them home. I like to drive them.

I will take the dog with me.

[Illustration]

Come, Don. You know how to drive the cows. You may come with me.

There they are by the meadow brook.

See, they are drinking from the brook.

Drive them, Don! Drive them home.

There they go! What a fine thing it is to live on a farm!"

THE BOX OF TOOLS


Frank lives in the city. He has never seen a farm. He has never seen a
brook.

He has never heard the robins singing in the tree tops.

A river runs by the city. Sometimes Frank goes down to the river to see
the boats and ships.

Sometimes he plays in the street by his home. The street is not a good
place to play.

Frank has many playthings, and he is as happy as any farmer boy. He
would not be happy on a farm.

[Illustration]

One day Frank's father gave him a box of tools.

Frank made many things with his tools.

He made a kite and a little wagon.

He made a stand for his mother. He made a cradle for his sister's doll.

SPRING


Winter has gone. Spring has come.

There is no snow on the ground now. The days are warm and bright. The
sun is high in the sky.

Soon the ground will be green with grass. There are wild flowers in the
woods now.

All the birds have come back from the South.

The robin is here. He is building a nest in the old tree. Soon there
will be some little blue eggs in the nest.

The old owl did not go South. But he is glad that spring has come.

THE FIVE GOATS


Five goats were in a field.

There they found green grass to eat, and good water to drink. At night
the farmer's boy and his little sister came to drive them home.

One night the goats wanted to stay in the field.

The little girl ran after them. But she could not drive them out.

"Now I will try," said the boy.

So the boy ran after the goats. But they would not go out for him.

Just then a dog came by.

"Let me try," said the dog. "I have more legs than a boy. I can run
faster."

He ran after the goats. He barked and barked. But the goats would not go
out of the field.

Soon a fox came to see what the dog was doing. "Let me try," he said.
"I know more than a dog, and I can run fast."

The fox ran after the goats. But he could not drive them out of the
field.

"Let me try," said a horse that was looking on. "I am big and strong."

But the goats would not go out for the horse.

A busy bee came into the field.

"Buzz! buzz!" it said. "I think I can drive them out. Let me try."

"What can you do? You are too little to drive goats," said the boy.

"You are smaller than I am," said the little girl.

"You can not bark," said the dog.

"You don't know much," said the fox. "You can't run round the field on
four feet," said the horse.

"Buzz, buzz, buzz!" said the bee. "We will see; we will see;" and away
it flew.

It flew by the big goat's ear.

"Buzz, buzz, buzz!" it said.

The goat looked up. "What is that?" he said; and he ran out of the
field.

The little goat looked up.

"If you go out, I will go out," he said; and out he ran.

"So will I. So will I. So will I," said the three white goats; and all
ran out of the field.

Then the boy and his sister drove the goats home. "If the bee had not
helped us, what could we have done?" they said.

MAKING BUTTER


Do you know how I make butter?

I will tell you.

Every day the cows give us fresh milk. Ned brings the milk to the house.

I have some large tin pans. At night I put the fresh milk in these pans.

In the morning I find yellow cream on the top of the milk.

Then I take off the cream and put it in my churn.

I churn and churn till the cream turns to butter. I take the butter out.

I leave the buttermilk in the churn.

[Illustration]

Here is one of my butter balls.

It is on a little dish.

Bennie and Marian like butter.

They like bread and milk, too.

All boys and girls eat bread.

Do you like bread and butter?




 MARY AND THE BROOK


    "Stop, stop, pretty brook!"
      Said Mary one day,
    To a bright, happy brook
      That was running away.

    "You run on so fast!
      I wish you would stay;
    My boat and my flowers
      You will carry away.

    "But I will run after;
      Mother says that I may;
    For I would know where
      You are running away."

    So Mary ran on;
      But I have heard say,
    That she never could find
      Where the brook ran away.

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
