DIRECTIONS

FOR

Navigating on Part of the South Coast of _NEWFOUNDLAND_.


N.B. _All Bearings and Courses hereafter-mentioned, are the true
Bearings and Courses, and not by Compass._

[Sidenote: Cape Chapeaurouge.]

Cape _Chapeaurouge_, or the Mountain of the _Red Hat_, is situated on
the West side of _Placentia Bay_, in the Latitude of 46 deg. 53' North,
and lies nearly West 17 or 18 Leagues from Cape St. _Maries_; it is
the highest and most remarkable Land on that Part of the Coast,
appearing above the rest something like the Crown of a Hat, and may be
seen in clear Weather 12 Leagues.

[Sidenote: Harbours of St. Laurence]

Close to the Eastward of Cape _Chapeaurouge_ are the Harbours of
_Great_ and _Little St. Laurence_. To sail into _Great St. Lawrence_,
which is the Westermost, there is no Danger but what lies very near
the Shore; taking Care with Westerly, and particularly S.W. Winds, not
to come too near the _Hat Mountain_, to avoid the Flerrys and Eddy
Winds under the high Land. The Course in is first N.W. till you open
the upper Part of the Harbour, then N.N.W. half W. The best Place for
great Ships to Anchor, and the best Ground is before a Cove on the
East-side of the Harbour in 13 Fathom Water. A little above _Blue
Beach Point_, which is the first Point on the West-side; here you lie
only two Points open: You may Anchor any where between this Point and
the Point of _Low Beach_, on the same Side near the Head of the
Harbour, observing that close to the West Shore, the Ground is not so
good as on the other Side. Fishing Vessels lay at the Head of the
Harbour above the Beach, sheltered from all Winds.

To sail into _Little St. Laurence_ you must keep the West Shore on
Board, in order to avoid a sunken Rock which lies a little without the
Point of the _Peninsula_, which stretches off from the East-side of
the Harbour: You Anchor above this _Peninsula_, (which covers you from
the Sea Winds) in 3 and 4 Fathom Water, a fine sandy Bottom. In these
Harbours are good Fishing Conveniencies, and plenty of Wood and Water.
Ships may Anchor without the _Peninsula_ in 12 Fathom good Ground, but
open to the S.S.E. Winds.

[Sidenote: Sauker Head.]

_Sauker-Head_ lies 3 Miles to the Eastward of Cape _Chapeaurouge_, it
is a pretty high round Point, off which lie some sunken Rocks, about a
Cable's Length from the Shore.

[Sidenote: Garden Bank]

This Bank whereon is from 7 to 17 Fathom Water, lies about half a Mile
off from _Little St. Laurence_, with _Blue Beach Point_ on with the
East Point of _Great St. Laurence_.

[Sidenote: Ferryland Head.]

_Ferryland head_ lies S.W. 1 Mile from Cape _Chapeaurouge_, it is a
high rocky Island, just seperated from the Main; it and Cape
_Chapeaurouge_ are sufficient Marks to know the Harbours of St.
_Laurence_.

[Sidenote: Bay of Laun.]

West 5 Miles from _Ferryland-Head_, lies the Bay of _Laun_, in the
Bottom of which are two small Inlets, called _Great_ and _Little
Laun_. _Little Laun_, which is the Eastermost, lies open to the S.W.
Winds, which generally prevails upon this Coast, and therefore no
Place to Anchor in. _Great Laun_ lies in about N. by E. 2 Miles, is
near half a Mile wide, whereon is from 14 to 3 Fathom Water. To sail
into it, you must be careful to avoid a sunken Rock, which lies about
a quarter of a Mile off from the East Point. The best Place to Anchor
is on the East-side, about half a Mile from the Head, in 6 and 5
Fathom; the Bottom is pretty good, and you are shelter'd from all
Winds, except S. and S. by W. which blow right in, and cause a great
swell. At the Head of this Place is a Bar Harbour, into which Boats
can go at half Tide; and Conveniences for a Fishery, and plenty of
Wood and Water.

[Sidenote: Laun Islands.]

Off the West Point of _Laun Bay_ lay the Islands of the same Name, not
far from the Shore; the Westermost and outermost of which lie W.
Southerly 10 Miles from _Ferryland-head_; near a quarter of a Mile to
the Southward of this Island is a Rock whereon the Sea breaks in very
bad Weather: There are other sunken Rocks about these Islands, but
they are no ways Dangerous, being very near the Shore.

[Sidenote: Taylor's Bay.]

This Bay which lies open to the Sea, lies 3 Miles to the Westward of
_Laun_ Islands; off the East Point are some sunken Rocks near a
quarter of a Mile from the Shore.

[Sidenote: Point Aux Gaul.]

A little to the Westward of _Taylors Bay_ there stretches out a low
Point of Land, called _Point Aux Gaul_; off which lies a Rock above
Water, half a Mile from the Shore, called _Gaul Shag Rock_; this Rock
lies West three quarters South 5 Leagues from _Ferryland-Head_, you
have 14 Fathom close to the off Side of it, but between it and the
Point are some sunken Rocks.

[Sidenote: Lamelin Bay.]

From _Point Aux Gaul Shag Rock_, to the Islands of _Lamelin_ is West
three quarters N. 1 League, between them is the Bay of _Lamelin_,
wherein is very shallow Water, and several small Islands, and Rocks
both above and under Water, and in the Bottom of it is a Salmon River.

[Sidenote: Lamelin Islands.]

The two Islands of _Lamelin_ (which are but low) lie off the West
Point of the Bay of the same Name, and lie West three quarters South,
6 Leagues from the Mountain of the _Red Hat_; but in steering along
Shore make a W. by S. Course good, will carry you clear of all Danger.
Small Vessels may Anchor in the Road between these Islands in 4 and 5
Fathom, tolerably well shelter'd from the Weather: Nearly in the
Middle of the Passage going in between the two Islands, is a sunken
Rock, which you avoid by keeping nearer to one Side than the other,
the most Room is on the East-side. The Eastermost Island communicates
with the Main at Low-water, by a narrow Beach, over which Boats can go
at High-water, into the N.W. Arm of _Lamelin Bay_, where they lay in
safety. Here are Conveniences for a Fishery, but little or no Wood of
any Sort. Near to the South Point of the Westermost Island is a Rock
pretty high above Water, called _Lamelin Shag Rock_; in going into the
Road between the Islands, you leave this Rock on your Larboard Side.

[Sidenote: Lamelin Ledges.]

These Ledges lay along the Shore, between _Lamelin Islands_ and _Point
May_, which is 3 Leagues, and are very Dangerous, some of them being 3
Miles from the Land. To avoid these Ledges in the Day-time, you must
not bring the Islands of _Lamelin_ to the Southward of East, until
_Point May_, or the Western extremity of the Land bear N. by E. from
you; you may then steer to the Northward with safety, between _Point
May_ and _Green Island_. In the Night, or foggy Weather, you ought to
be very careful not to approach these Ledges within 30 Fathom Water,
least you get intangled amongst them. Between them and the Main are
various Soundings from 16 to 5 Fathom.

[Sidenote: Observations.]

All the Land about Cape _Chapeaurouge_ and _Laun_, is high and hilly
close to the Sea; from _Laun Islands_ to _Lamelin_ it is of a moderate
Height; from _Lamelin_ to _Point May_, the Land near the Shore is very
low, with sandy Beaches, but a little way inland are Mountains.

[Sidenote: Island of St. Peter's.]

The Island of St. _Peter_'s lies in the Latitude 46 Degrees 46 Minutes
North. West by South near 12 Leagues from Cape _Chapeaurouge_, and
West by South half South 5 Leagues from the Islands of _Lamelin_; it
is about 5 Leagues in circuit, and pretty high, with a craggy, broken,
uneven Surface. Coming from the Westward, as soon as you raise
_Gallantry Head_, which is the South Point of the Island, it will make
in a round Hommock like a small Island and appears if seperated from
St. _Peter_'s. On the East-side of the Island, a little to the N.E.
of _Gallentry-Head_ lay three small Islands, the innermost of which is
the largest, called _Dog-Island_; within this Island is the Road and
Harbour of St. _Peter_'s; the Harbour is but small, and hath in it
from 12 to 20 Feet Water; but there is a Bar across the Entrance,
whereon there is but 6 Feet at Low-water, and 12 or 14 Feet at
High-water. The Road which lies on the N.W. Side of _Dog-Island_ will
admit Ships of any Burthen, but it is only fit for the Summer Season,
being open to the N.E. Winds; you may lay in 8, 10, and 12 Fathom, and
for the most Part is a hard rocky Bottom, there is very little clear
Ground; Ships of War commonly Buoy their Cables; the best Ground is
near the North Shore. Going in or out, you must not rainge too near
the East-side of _Boar-Island_, which is the Eastermost of the three
Islands above-mentioned, for fear of some sunken Rocks which lie East
about 1 Mile from it, and which is the only Danger about St.
_Peter_'s, but what lay very near the Shore.

[Sidenote: Island of Columbo.]

This Island is of a small circuit, but pretty high, and lies very near
the N.E. Point of St. _Peter_'s; between them is a very good Passage,
one-third of a Mile wide, wherein is 12 Fathom Water. On the
North-side of the Island is a Rock pretty high above Water, called
_Little Columbo_; and about a quarter of a Mile N.E. from this Rock is
a sunken Rock, whereon is 2 Fathom Water.

[Sidenote: Island of Langley.]

The Island of _Langley_, which lies on the N.W. Side of St. _Peter_'s,
is about 8 Leagues in Circuit, of a moderate and pretty equal height,
except the N. end, wich is a low Point with Sand Hills along it; it is
flat a little way off the low Land on both Sides of it, but all the
high Part of the Island is very bold too, and the Passage between it
and St. _Peter_'s (which is 1 League broad) is clear of Danger. You
may Anchor on the N.E. Side of the Island, a little to the Southward
of the _Sand Hills_, in 5 and 6 Fathom, a fine sandy Bottom, sheltered
from the Southerly, S.W. and N.W. Winds.

[Sidenote: Island of Miquelon.]

From the North Point of _Langley_, to the South Point of _Miquelon_ is
about 1 Mile; it is said that a few Years since they join'd together
at this Place by a Neck of Sand, which the Sea has wash'd away and
made a Channel, wherein is 2 Fathom Water. The Island of _Miquelon_ is
4 Leagues in Length from North to South, but of an unequal Breadth;
the Middle of the Island is high Land, called the high Land of _Dunn_;
but down by the Shore it is low, except Cape _Miquelon_, which is a
lofty Promontory at the Northern extremity of the Island.

[Sidenote: Dunn Harbour.]

On the S.E. Side of the Island, to the Southward of the high Land, is
a pretty large Bar-Harbour, called _Dunn Harbour_, which will admit
Fishing Shallops at half Flood, but can never be of any Utility for a
Fishery.

[Sidenote: Miquelon Rocks and Bank.]

_Miquelon Rocks_ stretches off from the East Point of the Island,
under the high Land 1 Mile and a quarter to the Eastward, some are
above and some under Water; the outermost of these Rocks are above
Water, and you have 12 Fathom close to them, and 18 and 20 Fathom 1
Mile off. N.E. half N. 4 or 5 Miles from these Rocks lie _Miquelon
Bank_ whereon is 6 Fathom Water.

[Sidenote: Road of Miquelon.]

The Road of _Miquelon_ (which is large and spacious) lies at the
North-end, and on the East-side of the Island, between Cape _Miquelon_
and a very remarkable round Mountain near the Shore, called
_Chapeaux_: Off the South Point of the Road are some sunken Rocks,
about a quarter of a Mile from the Shore, but every where else it is
clear of Danger. The best Anchorage is near the Bottom of the Road in
6 and 7 Fathom, fine sandy Bottom; you lay open to the Easterly Winds,
which Winds seldom blow in the Summer.

[Sidenote: Cape Miquelon.]

Cape _Miquelon_, or the Northern extremity of the Island is high bluff
Land; and when you are 4 or 5 Leagues to the Eastward or Westward of
it, you would take it for an Island, by reason the Land at the Bottom
of the Road is very low.

[Sidenote: Seal Rocks]

The _Seal Rocks_ are two Rocks above Water, lying 1 League and a half
off from the Middle of the West-side of the Island _Miquelon_; the
Passage between them and the Island is very safe, and you have 14 or
15 Fathom within a Cable's Length all round them.

[Sidenote: Green Island.]

This Island which is about three-quarters of a Mile in Circuit, and
low, lies N.E. 5 Miles from St. _Peter_'s, and nearly in the Middle of
the Channel, between it and _Point May_ on _Newfoundland_; on the
South-side of this Island are some Rocks both above and under Water,
extending themselves 1 Mile and a quarter to the S.W.


_Description of_ Fortune Bay.

_Fortune Bay_ is very large, the Entrance is form'd by _Point May_ and
_Pass Island_, which are 12 Leagues N. by E. and S. by W. from each
other, and it is about 23 Leagues deep, wherein are a great many Bays,
Harbours, and Islands.

[Sidenote: Island of Brunet.]

The Island of _Brunet_ is situated nearly in the Middle of the
Entrance into _Fortune Bay_, it is about 5 Leagues in Circuit, and of
a tolerable Height; the East-end appears at some Points of view like
Islands, by reason it is very low and narrow in two Places. On the
N.E. Side of the Island is a Bay, wherein is tolerable good Anchorage
for Ships in 14 and 16 Fathom, shelter'd from Southerly and Westerly
Winds; you must not run too far in for fear of some sunken Rocks in
the Bottom of it, a quarter of a Mile from the Shore; opposite this
Bay on the South-side of the Island, is a small Cove, wherein small
Vessels and Shallops can lay pretty secure from the Weather, in 6
Fathom Water; in the Middle of the Cove is a Rock above Water, and a
Channel on each Side of it. The Islands laying at the West-end of
_Brunet_, called _Little Brunets_, afford indifferent Shelter for
Shallops in blowing Weather; you may approach these Islands, and the
Island of _Brunet_, within a quarter of a Mile all round, there being
no Danger but what lay very near the Shore.

[Sidenote: Plate Islands]

_Plate Islands_ are three Rocks of a moderate Height, lying S.W. 1
League from the West-end of _Great Brunet_. The Southermost and
outermost of these Rocks, lay W. by S. half S. 11 Miles from Cape
_Miquelon_, and in a direct Line between _Point May_ and _Pass
Island_, 17 Miles from the former and 19 from the later; S.E. a
quarter of a Mile from the _Great Plate_ (which is the Northermost) is
a sunken Rock, whereon the Sea breaks, which it the only Danger about
them.

[Sidenote: Observations]

There are several strong and irregular Settings of the Tides or
Currents about the _Plate_ and _Brunet Islands_, which seem to have no
dependency on the Moon, and the Course of the Tides on the Coast.

[Sidenote: Island of Sagona.]

The Island of _Sagona_, which lies N.N.E. 2 Leagues from the East-end
of _Brunet_, is about 3 Miles and a half in circuit, of a moderate
Height, and bold too all round, at the S.W. end is a small Creek that
will admit Fishing Shallops; in the Middle of the Entrance is a sunken
Rock which makes it exceeding narrow, and difficult to get in or out,
except in fine Weather.

[Sidenote: Point May.]

_Point May_ is the Southern Extremity of _Fortune Bay_, and the S.W.
Extremity of this Part of _Newfoundland_; it may be known by a great
black Rock, nearly joining to the Pitch of the Point, and something
higher than the Land, which makes it look like a black Hommock on the
Point; near a quarter of a Mile right off from the Point, or this
round black Rock, are three sunken Rocks, whereon the Sea always
breaks.

[Sidenote: Dantzic Coves.]

Near 2 Miles North from _Point May_, is _Little Dantzic Cove_, and
half a Leag. from _Little Dantzic_ is _Great Dantzic Cove_; these
Coves are no Places of safety, being open to the Westerly Winds; the
Land about them is of a moderate Height, bold too, and clear of Wood.

[Sidenote: Fortune.]

From _Dantzic Point_ (which is the North Point of the Coves) to
_Fortune_ the Course is N.E. near 3 Leagues; the Land between them
near the Shore is of a moderate Height, and bold too; you will have in
most Places 10 and 12 Fathom two Cables Length from the Shore, 30 and
40 one Mile off, and 70 and 80 two Miles off. _Fortune_ lies North
from the East-end of _Brunet_, it is a Bar Place that will admit
Fishing Boats at a quarter Flood; and a Fishing Village situated in
the Bottom of a small Bay, wherein is Anchorage for Shipping in 6, 8,
10, and 12 Fathom; the Ground is none of the best, and you lay open to
near half the Compass.

[Sidenote: Grand Bank.]

[Sidenote: Great Garnish.]

[Sidenote: Frenchman's Cove.]

[Sidenote: Anchorage.]

Cape of _Grand Bank_ is a pretty high Point, lying 1 League N.E. from
_Fortune_; into the E. ward of the Cape is _Ship Cove_, wherein is
good Anchorage for Shipping, in 8 and 10 Fathom, shelter'd from
Southerly, Westerly, and N.W. Winds. _Grand Bank_ lies E.S.E. half a
League from the Cape, it is a Fishing Village, and a Bar Harbour, that
will admit Fishing Shallops at a quarter Flood; to this Place and
_Fortune_ resort the Crews of Fishing Ships, who lay their Ships up
in Harbour _Briton_. From the Cape of _Grand Bank_ to Point _Enragee_,
the Course is NE. a quarter E. 8 Leagues, forming a Bay between them,
in which the Shore is low with several sandy Beaches, behind which are
Bar Harbours that will admit Boats on the Tide of Flood, the largest
of which is _Great Garnish_, 5 Leagues from _Grand Bank_, it may be
known by several Rocks above Water laying before it, 2 Miles from the
Shore, the outmost of these Rocks are steep too, but between them and
the Shore are dangerous sunken Rocks. To the Eastward, and within
these Rocks is _Frenchman's Cove_, wherein you may Anchor with small
Vessels, in 4 and 5 Fathom Water, tolerably well shelter'd from the
Sea Winds, and seems a convenient Place for the Cod Fishery: The
Passage in is to the Eastward of the Rocks that are the highest above
Water; between them and some other lower Rocks laying off to the
Eastward from the East Point of the _Cove_, there is a sunken Rock
nearly in the Middle of this Passage, which you must be aware of. You
may Anchor any where under the Shore, between _Grand Bank_ and _Great
Garnish_ in 8 and 10 Fathom Water, but you are only shelter'd from the
Land Winds.

[Sidenote: Point Enragee.]

_Point Enragee_ is but low, but a little way in the Country is high
Land; this Point may be known by two Hommocks upon it close to the
Shore, but you must be very near, otherwise the Elevation of the high
Lands will hinder you from discovering them; close to the Point is a
Rock under Water.

From _Point Enragee_ to the Head of the Bay, the Course is first N.E.
a quarter E. 3 Leagues to _Grand Jervey_; then N.E. by E. half E. 7
Leagues and a half to the Head of the Bay; the Land in general along
the South-side is high, bold too, and of an uneven Height, with Hills
and Vallies of various extent; the Vallies for the most Part cloathed
with Wood, and water'd with small Rivulets.

[Sidenote: Bay L'Arjent.]

Seven Leagues to the Eastward of _Point Enragee_, is the Bay
_L'Argent_, wherein you may Anchor in 30 or 40 Fathom Water, shelter'd
from all Winds.

[Sidenote: Harbour Millee.]

The Entrance of Harbour _Millee_ is to the Eastward of the East Point
of _L'Argent_; before this Harbour and the Bay _L'Argent_ is a
remarkable Rock, that at a Distance appears like a Shallop under Sail.
_Harbour Millee_ branches into two Arms, one laying into the N.E. and
the other towards the E. at the upper Part of both is good Anchorage,
and various Sorts of Wood. Between this Harbour and _Point Enragee_,
are several Bar Harbours in small Bays, wherein are sandy Beaches, off
which Vessels may Anchor, but they must be very near the Shore to be
in a moderate Depth of Water.

[Sidenote: Cape Millee.]

_Cape Millee_ lies N.N.E. half E. 1 League from the afore-mentioned
_Shallop Rock_, and near 3 Leagues from the Head of _Fortune Bay_ is a
high reddish barren Rock. The wedth of _Fortune Bay_ at _Cape Millee_
doth not exceed half a League, but immediately below it, it is twice
as wide, by which this Cape may be easily known; above this Cape the
Land on both Sides is high, with steep craggy Cliffs. The Head of the
Bay is terminated by a low Beach, behind which is a large Pond or Bar
Harbour, into which Boats can go at quarter Flood. In this and all the
Bar Harbours between it and _Grand Bank_, are convenient Places for
building of Stages, and good Beaches for drying of Fish, for great
Numbers of Boats.

[Sidenote: Grand L'Pierre Harbour]

_Grand L'Pierre_ is a good Harbour, situated on the North-side of the
Bay, half a League from the Head, you can see no Entrance until you
are abreast of it; there is not the least Danger in going in, and you
may Anchor in any Depth from 8 to 4 Fathom, shelter'd from all Winds.

[Sidenote: English Harbour.]

_English Harbour_ lies a little to the Westward of _Grand L'Pierre_,
it is very small, and fit only for Boats and small Vessels.

[Sidenote: Little Bay de Leau.]

To the Westward of _English Harbour_ is a small Bay called _Little Bay
de Leau_, wherein are some small Islands, behind which is shelter for
small Vessels.

[Sidenote: New Harbour]

This Harbour is situated opposite _Cape Millee_, to the Westward of
_Bay de Leau_; it is but a small Inlet, yet hath good Anchorage on the
West-side in 9, 8, 7, and 5 Fathom Water, sheltered from the S.W.
Winds.

[Sidenote: Harbour Femme.]

Harbour _Femme_, which lies half a League to the Westward of _New
Harbour_, lies in NE. half a League, it is very narrow, and hath in it
23 Fathom Water, before the Entrance is an Island, near to which are
some Rocks above Water: the Passage into the Harbour is to the
Eastward of the Island.

[Sidenote: Brewer's Hole.]

One League to the Westward of _Harbour Femme_, is a small Cove called
_Brewer's Hole_, wherein is Shelter for Fishing Boats; before this
Cove is a small Island near the Shore, and some Rocks above Water.

[Sidenote: Harbour la Conte.]

This Harbour is situated one Mile to the Westward of _Brewer's Hole_,
before which are two Islands, one without the other; the outermost,
which is the largest is of a tolerable Height, and lies in a Line with
the Coast, and is not easy to be distinguished from the Main in
sailing along the Shore. To sail into this Harbour, the best Passage
is on the West-side of the outer Island, and between the two; as soon
as you begin to open the Harbour, you must keep the inner Island close
on Board, in order to avoid some sunken Rocks that lay near a small
Island, which you will discover between the NE. Point of the outer
Island, and the opposite Point on the Main; and likewise another Rock
under Water, which lays higher up on the Side of the Main; this Rock
appears at Low Water. As soon as you are above these Dangers, you may
steer up in the middle of the Channel, until you open a fine spacious
Bason, wherein you may Anchor in any Depth from 5 to 17 Fathom Water,
shut up from all Winds, the Bottom is Sand and Mud. In to the Eastward
of the outer Island, is a small Cove fit for small Vessels and Boats,
and Conveniencies for the Fishery.

Island in the Mouth of it, called _Gull Island_; and half a Mile
without this Island, is a Rock above Water, that hath the Appearance
of a small Boat. There is a Passage into the Harbour on each Side of
the Island, but the broadest is the Westermost. Nearly in the middle
of this Passage, a little without the Island is a Ledge of Rocks,
whereon is two Fathom Water; a little within the Island on the S.E.
Side are some sunken Rocks, about two Cables length from the Shore
laying off two sandy Coves; some of these Rocks appear at Low-water.
On the N.W. Side of the Harbour, two Miles within the Island is
_Morgan's Cove_, wherein you may Anchor in 15 Fathom Water, and the
only Place you can Anchor, unless you run into, or above the
_Narrows_, being every where else very deep Water. This Harbour runs

Island is high at each End, and low in the Middle, and at a Distance
looks like two Islands, it lies N. 30d. E. 8 and a half Leagues from
the Cape of _Grand Bank_, and N. E. by E. 7 Leagues from the East-end
of _Brunet_. The Passage into the Harbour is on the West Side of the
Island; there is not the least Danger in going in, or in any Part of
the Harbour; you may anchor in any Depth from 17 to 4 Fathom.

[Sidenote: Blue Pinion.]

Two Miles to the Westward of St. _Jaques_, is the Harbour of _Blue
Pinion_, it is not near so large, or so safe as that of St. _Jaques_;
near to the Head of the Harbour on the West Side is a Shoal, whereon
is two Fathom at Low Water.

[Sidenote: English Cove]

A little to the Westward of _Blue Pinion_, is _English Cove_, which is
very small, wherein small Vessels and Boats can Anchor; before it, and
very near the Shore is a small Island.

St. _Jaques_ Island, NNE. near 7 Leagues from the Cape of _Grand
Bank_, and NE. half E. 13 Miles from the East End of _Brunet_ Island;
it is of a moderate Height, the most advanced to the Southward of any
Land on the Coast, and may be distinguished at a considerable
Distance; there are some sunken Rocks off it, but they lay very near
the Shore, and are no ways dangerous.

[Sidenote: Boxy Harbour.]

NNE. three Miles from _Boxey_ Point is the Harbour of _Boxy_; to sail
into it you must keep _Boxy_ Point just open of _Fryer's_ Head (a
black Head a little within the Point) in this Direction you will keep
in the middle of the Channel between the Shoals which lay off from
each Point of the Harbour, where the Stages are; as soon as you are
within these Shoals, which cover you from the Sea Winds, you may
anchor in 5 and 4 Fathom Water, fine sandy Ground.

[Sidenote: St. John's Island, Head, Bay and Harbour.]

West 1 Mile from _Boxy_ Point is the Island of St. _John_'s, which is
of a tollerable Height, and steep too, except at the N.E. Point, where
is a Shoal a little way off.

N.W. half a League from St. _John_'s _Island_ is St. _John_'s _Head_,
which is a high, steep, craggy Point. Between St _John_'s _Head_ and
_Boxy Point_, is St. _John_'s _Bay_, in the Bottom of which is St.
_John_'s _Harbour_, wherein is only Water for Boats.

sunken Rocks.

[Sidenote: Great Bay de Leau.]

One League and a half to the Northward of St. _John_'s _Head_ is the
_Great Bay de Leau_, wherein is good Anchorage in various depths of
Water, sheltered from all Winds. The best Passage in is on the
East-side of the Island, laying in the Mouth of it; nothing can enter
in on the West-side but small Vessels and Shallops.

[Sidenote: Little Bay Barrysway.]

To the Westward of _Bay de Leau_, 3 Miles NNW. from St. _John_'s
_Head_ is _Little Bay Barrysway_, on the West-side of which is good
Anchorage for large Ships in 7, 8, or 10 Fathom Water; here is good
Fishing Conveniencies, with plenty of Wood and Water.

[Sidenote: Harbour Briton.]

[Sidenote: South West Arm.]

_Harbour Briton_ lies to the Westward of _Little Bay Barrysway_, North
1 Leag. and a half from the Island of _Sagona_, and N. by E. from
East-end of _Brunet_. The two Heads, which from the Entrance of this
Harbour or Bay are pretty high, and lay from each other E.N.E. and
W.S.W. above 2 Miles; near the East Head is a Rock above Water, by
which it may be known: There are no Dangers in going in until you are
the Length of the South Point of the S.W. Arm, which is more than a
Mile within the West Head; from off this Point stretches out a Ledge
of Rocks N.E. about two Cables Length; the only Place for King's Ships
to Anchor is above this Point, before the S.W. Arm in 16 or 18 Fathom
Water, mooring nearly East and West, and so near the Shore as to have
the East Head on with the Point above-mentioned; the Bottom is very
good, and the Place convenient for Wooding and Watering. In the SW.
Arm is Room for a great Number of Merchant Ships, and many
Conveniencies for Fishing Vessels.

[Sidenote: Jerseyman's Harbour.]

Opposite to the S.W. Arm is the N.E. Arm or _Jerseyman_'s _Harbour_,
which is capable of holding a great number of Ships, securely
shelter'd from all Winds. To sail into it you must keep the Point of
_Thompson_'s _Beach_ (which is the Beach Point, at the Entrance into
the S.W. Arm) open of _Jerseyman_'s _Head_, (which is a high bluff
Head at the North Entrance into _Jerseyman_'s _Harbour_) this Mark
will lead you over the Bar in the best of the Channel, where you will
have 3 Fathom at Low-water; as soon as you open the Harbour, haul up
North, and Anchor where its most convenient in 8, 7 or 6 Fathom Water,
good Ground, and shelter'd from all Winds. In this Harbour are several
convenient Places for erecting many Stages, and good Beach room.
_Jerseymen_ generally lay their Ships up in this Harbour, and cure
their Fish at _Fortune_ and _Grand Bank_.

[Sidenote: Gull Island, and Deadman's Bay.]

From Harbour _Briton_ to the W. end of _Brunet_, and to the _Plate
Islands_, the Course is S.W. by S. 6 Leagues and a half to the
Southermost _Plate_. From _Harbour Briton_ to _Cape Miquelon_ is S.W.
a quarter W. 10 Leagues. From the West Head of _Harbour Briton_ to
_Cannaigre Head_, the Course is W. by S. Distant 2 Leagues; between
them are _Gull-Island_ and _Deadman's Bay_. _Gull-Island_ lies close
under the Land, 2 Miles to the Westward of Harbour _Briton_.
_Deadman's Bay_ is to the Westward of _Gull-Island_, wherein you may
Anchor with the Land Winds. Between _Harbour Briton_ and _Cannaigre
Head_, is a Bank stretching off from the Shore between 2 and 3 Miles,
whereon is various Depths of Water from 34 to 4 Fathom. Fishermen say
that they have seen the Sea break in very bad Weather, a good way
without _Gull-Island_.

[Sidenote: Cannaigre Head.]

[Sidenote: Cannaigre Bay.]

[Sidenote: Cannaigre Rocks.]

_Cannaigre Head_ which forms the East Point of the Bay of the same
Name, lies North Easterly 3 Leagues and a half from the West-end of
_Brunet_; it is a high craggy Point, easy to be distinguished from any
Point of view. From this Head to _Basstarre_ Point, the Course is W.
by N. half N. 2 Leagues, and likewise W. by N. half N. 3 Leagues and a
half to the Rocks of _Pass Island_; but to give them a Birth make a W.
by N. Course good. Between _Cannaigre Head_ and _Basstarre Point_ is
_Cannaigre Bay_, which extends itself about 4 Leagues Inland, at the
Head of which is a Salmon River. In the Mouth of the Bay lay the Rocks
of the same Name above Water, you may approach these Rocks very near,
there being no Danger but what discovers itself. The Channel between
them and the North Shore is something Dangerous, by reason of a range
of Rocks which lie along Shore, and extend themselves 1 Mile off.

[Sidenote: Cannaigre Harbour.]

_Cannaigre Harbour_ which is very small, with 7 Fathom Water in it, is
within a Point on the South-side of the Bay, 5 Miles above the Head:
The Passage into the Harbour is on the S.E. Side of the Island, lying
before it. Nearly in the Middle of the Bay, abreast of this Harbour,
are two Islands of a tolerable Height, on the South-side of the
Westermost Island, which is the largest, are some Rocks above Water.

[Sidenote: Dawson's Cove.]

This Cove is on the N.W. Side of the Bay, bears North, Distance about
4 Miles from the Head, and East 2 Miles from the W. end of the _Great
Island_. In it are good Fishing Conveniences, and Anchorage for
Vessels in 6 and 5 Fathom Water, but they will lay open to the
Southerly Winds. Between the S.W. Point of this Cove and _Basstarre
Point_, which is 5 Miles Distance, lays the Range of Rocks
beforementioned.

[Sidenote: Basstarre Point.]

_Basstarre Point_ which forms the West Point of _Cannaigre Bay_, is of
a moderate Height, clear of Wood, and bold too, all the way from it to
_Pass-Island_, which bears N.W. by W. 1 League from _Basstarre Point_.

[Sidenote: Observations.]

The Land on the North-side of _Fortune Bay_ for the most Part is
hilly, rising directly from the Sea, with craggy, barren Hills, which
extends 4 or 5 Leag. Inland, with a great Number of Rivulets and
Ponds. The Land on the South side of _Fortune Bay_, has a different
Appearance to that on the North-side, being not so full of craggy
Mountains, and better cloathed with Woods, which are of a short brushy
kind, which makes the face of the Country look green.

[Sidenote: Pass Island.]

_Pass Island_ lies N. 16 deg. 30' East 7 Leagues and a half from _Cape
Miquelon_, it is the N.W. extremity of _Fortune Bay_, and lies very
near the Shore, is more than 2 Miles in circuit and is pretty high. On
the S.W. Side are several Rocks above Water, which extend themselves 1
Mile from the Island, and on the N.W. Side is a sunken Rock at a
quarter of a Mile from the Island; the Passage between this Island and
the Main, which is near two Cables Length wide, is very safe for small
Vessels, wherein you may Anchor in 6 Fathom, a fine sandy Bottom. This
Island is well situated for the Cod Fishery, there being very good
Fishing Ground about it.

[Sidenote: On the Soundings.]

In the Night time, or in foggy Weather, Ships ought to place no great
Dependance on the Soundings in _Fortune Bay_, least they may be
deceived thereby, for you have more Water in many Parts near the
Shore, and in several of its contained Bays and Harbours, than in the
middle of the Bay itself.


Description of _Hermitage Bay_.

From _Pass Island_ to _Great Jervis Harbour_, at the Entrance into the
Bay of _Despair_, the Course is N. by E. a quarter E. near three
Leagues; and from _Pass Island_ to the West End of _Long Island_, the

of _Hermitage Bay_, 3 Leagues and a half from _Pass Island_; near to
these Islands is good Fishing Ground.

[Sidenote: Hermitage Cove.]

_Hermitage Cove_ is on the South-side of the Bay, opposite to _Fox's
Islands_. To sail into it, you must keep between the Islands and the
South Shore, where there is not the least Danger; in this Cove is good
Anchorage for Shipping in 8 and 10 Fathom Water, and good Fishing
Conveniences, with plenty of Wood and Water.

[Sidenote: Long Island.]

_Long Island_, which separates the Bay of _Despair_ from _Hermitage_,
is of a triangular Form, about 8 Leagues in Circuit, of a tolerable
Height, is hilly, uneven and barren. The East Entrance into the Bay of
_Despair_ from _Hermitage Bay_, is by the West-end of _Long Island_;
about half a Mile from the S.W. Point of the said Island, are two
Rocks above Water, with deep Water all round them.

[Sidenote: Long Island Harbour.]

This Harbour lies on the South-side of _Long Island_, 2 Miles and a
half from the West-end; before which is an Island, and several Rocks
above Water, there is a narrow Passage into the Harbour on each Side
of the Island; this Harbour is formed by two Arms, one laying into the
North, and the other to the Eastward; they are both very narrow, and
have in them from 42 to 7 Fathom Water; the East Arm is the deepest,
and the best Anchorage.

[Sidenote: Round Harbour.]

This Harbour, wherein is 6 Fathom Water, lies near 2 Miles to the E.
ward of _Long Island Harbour_, is also in _Long-Island_; it will only
admit very small Vessels, by reason the Channel going in is very
narrow.

[Sidenote: Picarre.]

_Harbour Picarre_ lies N. by W. half a League from _Little Fox
Island_, (which is the Westermost of _Fox Islands_) to sail into it
you must keep near the West-point to avoid some sunken Rocks off the
other, and anchor in the first Cove on the East-side in 9 or 10
Fathom, sheltered from all Winds.

[Sidenote: Galtaus.]

This Harbour, which is but small, lies near the East-point of
_Long-Island_; at the Entrance is several rocky Islands. The best
Channel into the Harbour is on the West-side of these Islands, wherein
is 4 Fathom Water, but in the harbour is from 15 to 24 Fathom. Here
are several Places proper for erecting of Stages; and both this
Harbour and _Picarre_ are conveniently situated for a Fishery, they
laying contiguous to the Fishing Ground about _Fox Islands_.

[Sidenote: Passage of Long Island]

Between the East-end of _Long Island_ and the Main, is a very good
Passage out of _Hermitage Bay_, into the Bay of _Despair_.


Description of the Bay of _Despair_.

The Entrance of the Bay of _Despair_ lies between the West-end of
_Long Island_ and _Great Jervis Island_, (an Island in the Mouth of
the Harbour of the same Name) the Distance from one to the other is 1
Mile and a Quarter, and in the Middle between them is no Soundings
with 280 Fathoms.

[Sidenote: Great Jervis Island.]

_Great Jervis Harbour_ is situated at the West Entrance into the Bay
of _Despair_ is a snug and safe Harbour, with good Anchorage in every
Part of it, in 16, 18 or 20 Fathom, though but small will contain a
great Number of Shipping, securely sheltered from all Winds, and very
convenient for wooding and watering. There is a Passage into this
Harbour on either Side of _Great Jervis Island_, the southermost is
the safest, there being in it no Danger but the Shore itself. To sail
in on the North-side of the Island, you must keep in the middle of the
Passage, until you are within two small Rocks above Water near to each
other on your Starboard-side, a little within the North Point of the
Passage; you must then bring the said North Point between these Rocks,
and steer into the Harbour, in that Directions will carry you clear of
some sunken Rocks which lie off the West Point of the Island; these
Rocks appear at Low-water. The Entrance into this Harbour may be known
by the East-end of _Great Jervis Island_, which is a high steep craggy
Point, called _Great Jervis Head_, and is the North Point of the South
Entrance into the Harbour.

[Sidenote: North Bay.]

This is an Arm of the Bay of _Despair_, which extends to the Northward
5 Leagues from _Great Jervis Island_. In this Bay is very deep Water,
and no Anchorage but in the small Bays and Coves which are on each
Side of it. At the Head of the Bay of the East, which is an Arm of the
North Bay, is a very fine Salmon River, and plenty of various Sorts of
Wood.

[Sidenote: Eagle Island.]

To the Northward of _Long Island_, the Bay of _Despair_ extends itself
to the NE. about 8 Leagues, whereon are several Arms and Islands. The
first is _Eagle Island_ laying on the North-side of _Long Island_,
about half a Cable's Length from the Shore; a little to the Eastward
of it is a small Cove, wherein small Vessels can Anchor in 5 Fathom
Water; off the E. Point of this Cove are some sunken Rocks, the
outermost of which lay a quarter of a Mile from the Shore, and appears
at half Ebb.

[Sidenote: Frenchman's Harbour.]

This harbour lies on the North-side of _Long Island_, 2 Miles above
_Eagle Island_, in and before which Vessels may anchor in various
Depths of Water; about a Cable's length to the Eastward of the West
Point of the Harbour is a sunken Rock whereon is 8 Feet Water; a
little way further to the Eastward is a small Island not far from the
Shore, near to which is a Rock that just Covers at high Water.

[Sidenote: Isle Bois.]

On the North-side of the Bay, opposite to _Long Island_, lies the
_Isle Bois_, it is near 3 Leagues in Length, and of a tolerable
Height; the Passage on the North-side of it (called _Lampadois_
Passage) is very safe, but very deep Water.

[Sidenote: Fox Island.]

This Island lies nearly in the middle of the Bay, between the East-end
of the Isle of _Bois_ and _Long Island_, it is of a round Form, pretty
high, and bold too all round.

[Sidenote: Isle Riches.]

The _Isle Riches_ lies off the East-end of the Isle of _Bois_, it is
about a Mile in Circuit, and pretty high; on the East-side of it are
some small Islands, and some sunken Rocks quite a-cross from the
Island to the Main, so that in sailing up the Bay of _Despair_, you
must leave this Island on your Starboard-side.

[Sidenote: Little River.]

This is an Arm of the Bay laying in to the Eastward from the Isle of
_Riches_, it is very narrow, and counted a good Place for a Salmon
Fishery; its Banks are stored with various Sorts of Wood.

[Sidenote: Bay Rotte.]

This is a small Bay which lays North from the East-end of the Isle of
_Bois_, in which are some sunken Rocks near the Head.

[Sidenote: Bay of Conne.]

From the Isle of _Riches_ the Bay extends itself to the Northward
about five Miles, commonly called the Bay or River of _Conne_, then
branches into two Arms, one still tending to the North, and the other
to the Eastward; the Water is very shallow for some Distance from the
Head of both. About these Arms, and the Bay of _Conne_, are great
Plenty of all Sorts of Wood, common to this Country, such as Firr,
Pine, Birch, Witch-Hasle, Spruce, _&c._

[Sidenote: Observations.]

All the Country about the Entrance into the Bay of _Despair_, and for
a good Way up it is very mountainous and barren, but about the Head of
the Bay it appears to be pretty level, and well cloathed with Wood.

[Sidenote: On the Tides.]

Between St. _Laurence_ and Point _May_, an ESE. Moon makes high Water
at the Islands of St. _Peters_ and _Miquelon_, and in all Parts of
_Fortune Bay_ a S.E. Moon makes High Water. In the Bay of _Despair_ a
SE. by S. Moon makes High Water; in all which Places it flows up and
down, or upon a perpendicular Spring Tides 7 or 8 Feet; but it must be
observed that they are every where greatly governed by the Winds and
Weather.

[Sidenote: Currents.]

The Currents on the Sea Coasts from Cape _Chapeaurouge_ towards St.
_Peter's_, sets generally to the SW. On the South-side of _Fortune
Bay_ it sets to the Eastward, and on the North-side to the Westward.

[Sidenote: Winds.]

The South West, and Westerly Winds generally blow in the Day during
the Summer, and about the Evening they die away; and in the Night you
have Land Breezes or Calms.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://www.gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
