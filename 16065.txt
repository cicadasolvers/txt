BOOK THE FIRST

BY

LYDIA LEAVITT




LEAD KINDLY LIGHT

[Illustration]


"Lead, kindly light," The words are lightly spoken by the young,
who tread life's pathway with nimble feet, whose eager hands are
outstretched to gather life's roses, regardless of thorns, whose voice
is rippling with laughter and mirth, with blood coursing through the
veins and bright eyes looking fearlessly into the future; the words have
merely a joyous, musical ring. "Lead, kindly light."

"Lead, kindly light." The words are gravely spoken by the middle-aged,
whose feet have grown a trifle weary, whose hands have gathered the
roses, only to find them turned to ashes, whose laughter has more
sadness than mirth, whose eyes have grown dim, whose lips tremblingly
plead, "Lead, kindly light." "Lead, kindly light." The words are
whispered by the old, whose tired feet are unable to move, whose palsied
hands are helpless, whose head is bowed by the weight of years, whose
eyes are sightless, from whose trembling lips are scarcely heard the
whispered prayer, "Lead, kindly light."

"Lead, kindly light." The sunken eyes are closed in death, the tired
hands are folded, the heart has ceased to beat, the mute lips are
stilled, the weary feet are at rest, a look of ineffable peace rests
upon the still face, while all the air is filled with sweet music and
the murmur of gentle voices pleading, "Lead, kindly light."




A FABLE

[Illustration]

In one of the German forests the stood a tree, which could not be
classified by any of the learned scientists. It was not more beautiful
than many others, but there were distinctive peculiarities which no
other tree possessed. Her dress was of a sadder hue than that of her
companions, and the birds refused to build their nests in her branches.
She was unable to understand the language of her brothers and sisters
and so stood alone and unheeded in the dense forest. One morning she
awakened and found standing by her side a companion tree, odd, like
herself, and she said in her heart:--"I shall be no longer alone. He
will understand my language and we shall hold sweet converse." But he,
in his heart, was saying--"What strange tree is this? We two are unlike
all our companions. I like it not." But she did not hear the murmur of
discontent, and her heart grew glad within her at the great joy that had
come to her and she said in her heart:--"I will cause him to forget that
we are unlike our companions; I will sing to him my softest songs and
gradually her dress of sombre green assumed a brighter hue, young buds
sprang forth, her branches waved softly in the breeze and she wooed the
birds by gentle voice to build their nests in her arms, and,

    "In foul weather and in fair,
    Day by day in vaster numbers,
    Flocked the poets of the air."

At eventide she folded them in her bosom, that their songs might not
disturb the sleep of her companion, and while all the forest slept, she
alone was awake and, in the silence of the night, she murmured softly,
"Ich liebe Dich," and when the sun arose the birds from her arms flew
through the forest, singing, "Ich liebe Dich," and all the trees took up
the song; the birds, the trees and the brooks caught up the refrain and
all the great forest sang, "Ich liebe Dich, Ich liebe Dich."

So the summer passed and her heart grew sad, for she saw the discontent
of her companion, but she said to herself, "When the winter comes I will
shelter him from the blasts," but he said complainingly, "I would I were
like the other trees; I would like my garments to be as those I see
around me. I would my limbs were as those of my companions all through
the forest." And she heard, and said to herself, "I will make his
garments of brilliant green." So she sent from her own roots and
branches the sap--her life blood--to enrich the roots and beautify the
dress of her companion. When the cold blast of winter swept through the
forest she sheltered him with her long limbs, when the snow fell she
covered his head with her branches and caught the weight of snow in her
own arms; so all through the long winter she sheltered him from the
blasts and the weight of snow bore heavily on her branches and at times
they grew weary almost to breaking but her great heart never faltered.

So the spring came and day by day she sent from her own store of
life-blood to enrich that of her companion and soon his garments assumed
the most brilliant hues of all the trees in the forest; the leaves
glinted and glistened in the sunlight, and from the branches there was
ever a low murmur of song; the birds came to build their nests and rear
their young in his arms; and over all there floated a delicate perfume
born of the love which she had breathed over him all the long winter. So
in all the forest there was none so beautiful and stately as he.

His companion said, "Now will he be happy," but her own great heart
began to beat more slowly, the life-blood of which she had given him
could not be replaced, and her garments gradually assumed a sombre hue
and her arms were empty, for the birds no longer nested there.

One morning she awakened and found her companion gone. He had joined the
other trees in the forest; and now the limbs that had borne the weight
of snow began to wither, her leaves began to fall, and when the winter
came again there was no raiment to cover her.

And the woodman said,

"We will cut this tree down, it is dead."

THE WIND


[Illustration]

"Hark to the voice of the wind!" we say, as the windows rattle and house
shakes; the winds as they shout in angry voices, clamoring louder in
their fury, are telling of storms at sea, of the battles with the ships
and the brave hearts that have gone to their death.

    "It has been on the desolate ocean
      When the lightening struck the mast;
    It has heard the cry of the drowning,
      Who sank as they hurried past.
    The words of despair and anguish
      That were heard by no living ear;
    The gun that no signal answered--
      It brings them all to us here.
    Hark to the voice of the wind!"

It shakes angrily the trees whose limbs are swaying in protest against
the onslaught; it carries the leaves rustling to the ground, and in its
fury uproots the giant oaks, which groan in agony as they are hurled to
the ground, lying like soldiers on the field of battle.

    "Hark to the voice of the wind!"

Its fury is abated, and softly, like a benediction it enters the room
where the weary mother is watching by the bedside of her sick child; it
gently fans the fevered head; it touches with a caress the parched lips
of the babe, and with murmur of song it lulls the child to rest.

    "Hark to the voice of the wind."

It enters the counting room of the tired man of business, bringing a
perfume of flowers: he lays down his pen, while his thoughts go back to
the home of his boyhood, to the meadows, to the hillside covered with
flowers, the new-mown hay, and the tired brain is refreshed, he knows
not how, and the unseen messenger is gone--

    "Hark to the voice of the wind!"

It visits the silent City of the Dead and gently scatters the leaves
over the new-made grave of a young child, sighing softly the while, the
voice now rising, now falling, sobbing and moaning, and at last dies
away in a melancholy sound, like the strings of an Aeolian harp touched
by unseen hands.

    "Hark to the music of the wind!"

Human nature approaches the Divine in moments of great sacrifice,
forgiveness and self-forgetfulness.




PASSING THOUGHTS


"It seems the fate of woman to wait in silence while men act," 'Men must
work and woman must weep.'

       *       *       *       *       *

How delightful it must be to understand one's own nature thoroughly, to
know that no whirlwind will ever sweep us off the beaten track, no
stormy passions stir the calm placidity of our life. But is that life?
No, give me the glories of expectation, the wildest exhaltation; the
heart beating, the brain throbbing, the stormiest passions with force
enough to carry everything before them, even if they bring deep
grief--that is life.

       *       *       *       *       *

People who deal in dry, hard facts are not interesting. They may make
themselves names in the financial world, may become railway magnates and
coal kings, may control the money market; but they are not interesting.
They are the prose of life. They who see the clouds forming into
fantastic shapes, the glories of a sunset, the shadows in pools, the
colour on a bird's wing, the rose tint on the cheek of a child,--they
and such as they are the poetry of life.

Man's inhumanity to man is proverbial, woman's inhumanity to woman is
diabolical.

       *       *       *       *       *

"Society, as it exists at present moment in Colonial towns and cities,
possesses neither birth, brains or breeding."

       *       *       *       *       *

"We hear men speak so frequently of womanly women, ending their praises
with, 'she is essentially womanly.' I knew one of these womanly women,
whose voice was like liquid music, whose ways were gentle, whose eyes
filled with tears at the recital of some tale of woe, and always about
her was an air of gentle, womanly sweetness and dainty femininity. She
had a friend who loved her, one whose voice was not so soft, whose
manner was brusque, who was considered, "not quite good form, you know."
My womanly woman allowed this friend to take upon herself the burden of
a sin which she herself had committed, allowed her to bear the brunt of
scorn and contumely of her world, allowed her to die without righting
the great wrong. A lonely grave and a plain marble slab mark the spot
where she who was "not quite good form," lies: while she, to whom she
had given more than life, gathers the rose leaves with dainty grace, for
she is so essentially 'womanly.'"

Life: a little joy, great sorrow, some tragedy, and the curtain falls.

       *       *       *       *       *

Nothing can hurt so cruelly as the hand of love. The hand of hate is
velvet in comparison.

       *       *       *       *       *

There are women who consider the world well lost for the man whom they
love and idealize; while upon close acquaintance they would discover
that he was not worth even the loss of a dinner.

       *       *       *       *       *

Twelve "good men and true", will, after mature deliberation, consign a
man to the gallows. Twelve women, good and true, will, without any
deliberation, send a woman to death by their venomous tongues.

       *       *       *       *       *

There are a few people who would change their individuality for that of
another. We might be willing to exchange positions, to exchange all that
is apparent to the eyes of the world, but our inner consciousness, our
memories, our thoughts, feelings and desires; all that is part and
parcel of ourselves, we hold sacred.

Some minds are so small that a favour weighs heavily upon them.

       *       *       *       *       *

At times one is inclined to believe that even the gods are guilty of
favouritism.

       *       *       *       *       *

Some people's lives are like a flower, the more they are crushed, the
sweeter the perfume they exhale.

       *       *       *       *       *

There are some people who look so rigidly virtuous and repellant that it
is a satisfaction to feel one's self just a little bit wicked.

       *       *       *       *       *

We look to the higher classes and to the lower for good breeding. Middle
class people are proverbially ill-bred. What can equal the airs and
assumptions of the retired grocer's wife, who has neither the breeding
of a lady, nor the unaffected manner of the working-woman.

       *       *       *       *       *

What a pity there is such an incessant babbling of human tongues, when
the daisies by the wayside, the trees of the forest, the birds in their
nests, could tell us such wondrous things if our ears were attuned to
hear, but the senses are deadened by the discordant din of dismal
sounds.

Love is the one power which transfigures the common things of life.

       *       *       *       *       *

One-half of our lives is spent in making blunders, the other half in
trying to rectify them.

       *       *       *       *       *

How useless to tell many people to think, for they have nothing to
think. A man reasons, a woman divines.

       *       *       *       *       *

There are so many inconsistencies in life that at times one is appalled.
Take marriage, for instance:--A young woman marries a man who is
tottering on the brink of the grave; old, blaze, a worn-out roue; but
with money enough to gild and gloss the antiquated ruin. She goes before
a clergyman and promises to love, honour and obey. Yes; she loves the
luxury with which she will be surrounded, the glitter of diamonds, the
equipages, the great house, all the paraphanalia of wealth, but she
_hates_ the trembling, tottering, blear-eyed object who bought her.

The clergyman gives his blessing, society receives them with open arms,
and legalized prostitution is upheld by the majesty of the law and
encircled by the sanctified robes of the Church.

The ruling passion of the age: worship of self and worship of pelf.

       *       *       *       *       *

The age of good breeding has passed; insolence has taken its place.

       *       *       *       *       *

A woman ceases to think of self when she looks in the face of her
new-born child.

       *       *       *       *       *

There are people who go through life as if they were going to their own
funeral--and did not enjoy it.

       *       *       *       *       *

I would rather have for a friend the most thorough-paced scamp, with a
generous heart, than the most respectable, canting, whining, Pharisee.

       *       *       *       *       *

To stand in a rarefied atmosphere on a mountain height and view the
struggles of ordinary mortals below may be poetic, but it is very
lonely.

       *       *       *       *       *

A woman may defy the world for a man she loves, and imagine that he will
love her for the sacrifice, but no greater mistake can be made. Men are
not so constituted. When he sees her standing alone, dishonored, a mark
for the finger of scorn, her charm for him is forever lost.

       *       *       *       *       *
Realism is the grave of love.

       *       *       *       *       *

A woman's smile is two edged.

       *       *       *       *       *

Life is too short to prepare a soul for eternity

       *       *       *       *       *

A great love is only inspired by a great nature.

       *       *       *       *       *

It is as wise to cultivate forgetfulness as memory.

       *       *       *       *       *

Society, a haven for fools; literature and art for brains.

       *       *       *       *       *

Many people have courage to face anything but themselves.

       *       *       *       *       *

A woman is always in love, either with herself or with love.

       *       *       *       *       *

Two things in life man regards with esteem: himself and his pipe.

       *       *       *       *       *

Truth and sincerity are only found in the face of a child and the eyes
of a dog.

       *       *       *       *       *

A young face and an old heart are sorry companions, but an old face and
a young heart are sorrier still.

       *       *       *       *       *

What people will 'say' is the bugbear of small minds.

       *       *       *       *       *

Love would cease to exist were it not for the gift of idealizing.

       *       *       *       *       *

A fly is but a small thing, yet it can disturb the greatest philosopher.

       *       *       *       *       *

Is a new soul created at every birth, or are we merely corpses warmed
over?

       *       *       *       *       *

Kind words and a sympathetic handclasp have done more to reclaim lost
souls than all the tracts ever published.

       *       *       *       *       *

A minute is a short duration of time, yet in that interval one may
experience the whole gamut of human emotions.

       *       *       *       *       *

If the world valued us as we value ourselves the heavens would not be
sufficiently large whereon to inscribe our greatness.

       *       *       *       *       *

What becomes of the characters who play an important part in fiction;
the strong, brave, true fiction-people, whom we love as we read? Is
there no place for them in the world peopled by shadows?

       *       *       *       *       *

There are men who will accept any and every sacrifice from a woman and
after making her a wreck, socially and morally, will say to her, "I fear
that I am injuring you, so I will sacrifice myself and deny myself the
pleasure of your society." Such men would sneak into heaven by a side
entrance.

       *       *       *       *       *

Fate, in a sportive mood, performs some wonderful acrobatic feats with
human nature; gives love of oriental luxury to the woman with nothing a
year; appreciation of all that is beautiful and artistic, to the
ploughman; an epicurian taste to the starving mechanic; while to the
woman rolling in wealth is given the manners and tastes of the
fish-wife; to the multi-millionaire the habits of the canaille, and fate
laughs with glee over the fantastic, incongruous muddle of the thing
called Life.

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
