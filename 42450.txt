PREFACE.


Virginia, or the Old Dominion, as her children delight to call her,
has always been famed for the style of her living. Taught by the
example of her royal colonial governors, and the numerous adherents of
King Charles, who brought hither in their exile the graces and
luxuriousness of his brilliant court, she became noted among the
colonies for the princely hospitality of her people and for the beauty
and richness of their living. But when at length her great son in the
House of Burgesses sounded the cry of war, and her people made haste
to gird themselves for the long struggle, her daughters, not to be
outdone either in services or patriotism, set about at once the
inauguration of a plan of rigid retrenchment and reform in the
domestic economy, while at the same time exhibiting to their sisters a
noble example of devotion and self-sacrifice.

Tearing the glittering arms of King George from their sideboards, and
casting them, with their costly plate and jewels, as offerings into
the lap of the Continental Congress, they introduced in their homes
that new style of living in which, discarding all the showy
extravagance of the old, and retaining only its inexpensive graces,
they succeeded in perfecting that system which, surviving to this day,
has ever been noted for its beautiful and elegant simplicity.

This system, which combines the thrifty frugality of New England with
the less rigid style of Carolina, has been justly pronounced, by the
throngs of admirers who have gathered from all quarters of the Union
around the generous boards of her illustrious sons, as the very
perfection of domestic art.

It is the object of the compiler of this book, for she does not claim
the title of author, to bring within the reach of every American
housekeeper who may desire it, the domestic principles and practices
of these famous Virginia homes. In doing this she has not sought to
pursue the plan adopted by so many authors of such books--to depend
upon her own _authorship_ for her rule. She confesses that in this
matter her labors have been largely editorial.

Through a long life it has been her good fortune to be a frequent
visitor, and often the intimate guest and kinswoman, at many of these
homes; and she has sought, by the opportunities thus afforded, and
guided by her own extensive experience as a housekeeper, to gather and
select from these numerous sources those things which seemed to her
best and most useful to the practical housewife, and which, carefully
observed, would bring the art within reach of all who have the
ambition to acquire it.

It will be seen that she is indebted to near 250 contributors to her
book. Among these will be found _many names famous_ _through the
land_. Associated with them will be discovered others of less national
celebrity, but who have acquired among their neighbors an equally
merited distinction for the beautiful order and delightful cuisine of
their homes.

The labors of the writer have been greatly lightened by the kindness
of these contributors. And she desires in this public way to renew her
thanks for the aid which they have given her, but even more for the
goodness which prompts them, at cost of their sensitiveness, to allow
her to append their names to the recipes which they furnish.

The book, after great care in its preparation, is now offered to the
public with much confidence. All that is here presented has been so
thoroughly tested, and approved by so many of the best housekeepers in
Virginia, that she feels it must meet with a cordial and very general
reception at the hands of all accomplished housewives throughout the
land, and will supply a long-felt and real need.

If she shall thus succeed in disseminating a knowledge of the practice
of the _most admirable system of domestic art known in our country_;
if she shall succeed in lightening the labors of the housewife by
placing in her reach a guide which will be found _always trusty and
reliable_; if she shall thus make her tasks lighter and home-life
sweeter; if she shall succeed in contributing something to the health
of American children by instructing their mothers in the art of
preparing light and wholesome and palatable food; _if she, above all,
shall succeed in making American homes more attractive to American
husbands, and spare_ _them a resort to hotels and saloons for those
simple luxuries which their wives know not how to provide_; if she
shall thus add to the comfort, to the health and happy contentment of
these, she will have proved in some measure a public benefactor, and
will feel amply repaid for all the labor her work has cost.

HOUSEKEEPING IN OLD VIRGINIA.




BREAD.


Bread is so vitally important an element in our nourishment that I
have assigned to it the first place in my work. Truly, as Frederika
Bremer says, "when the bread rises in the oven, the heart of the
housewife rises with it," and she might have added that the heart of
the housewife sinks in sympathy with the sinking bread.

I would say to housewives, be not daunted by one failure, nor by
twenty. Resolve that you _will_ have good bread, and never cease
striving after this result till you have effected it. If persons
without brains can accomplish this, why cannot you? I would recommend
that the housekeeper acquire the practice as well as the theory of
bread-making. In this way, she will be able to give more exact
directions to her cook and to more readily detect and rectify any
blemish in the bread. Besides, if circumstances should throw her out
of a cook for a short time, she is then prepared for the emergency. In
this country fortunes are so rapidly made and lost, the vicissitudes
of life are so sudden, that we know not what a day may bring forth. It
is not uncommon to see elegant and refined women brought suddenly face
to face with emergencies which their practical knowledge of household
economy and their brave hearts enable them to firmly meet and
overcome.

To return to the bread question, however. Good flour is an
indispensable requisite to good bread. Flour, whether old or new,
should always be sunned and aired before being used. In the morning,
get out the flour to be made up at night for next morning's breakfast.
Sift it in a tray and put it out in the sun, or, if the day is damp,
set it near the kitchen fire. Only experience will enable you to be a
good judge of flour. One test is to rub the dry flour between your
fingers, and if the grains feel round, it is a sign that the flour is
good. If after trying a barrel of flour twice, you find it becomes wet
and sticky, after being made up of the proper consistency, you had
better then return it to your grocer.

The best flour is worthless without good yeast. Yeast made up in the
morning ought to be fit for use at night. It should be foamy and
frothy, with a scent slightly like ammonia. After closely following
the directions for yeast-making, given in the subsequent pages, the
bread will be apt to succeed, if the flour employed is good.

There is a great art in mixing bread, and it is necessary to observe a
certain rotation in the process. To make a small quantity of bread,
first sift one quart of flour; into that sift a teaspoonful of salt,
next rub in an Irish potato, boiled and mashed fine, then add a piece
of lard the size of a walnut, and next a half teacup of yeast in which
three teaspoonfuls of white sugar have been stirred. (Under no
circumstances use soda or saleratus in your light dough.) Then make
into a soft dough with cold water in summer, and lukewarm in winter.
Knead without intermission for half an hour, _by the clock_. Otherwise
five minutes appear to be a half hour when bread is being kneaded or
beaten. Then place it in a stone crock, greased with lard at the
bottom, and set it to rise. In summer, apply no artificial heat to it,
but set it in a cool place. As bread rises much more quickly in summer
than in winter, you must make allowance for this difference, during
the respective seasons. The whole process, including both the first
and second rising, may be accomplished in seven or eight hours in
summer, though this will be regulated partly by the flour, as some
kinds of flour rise much more quickly than others. In summer you may
make it up at nine o'clock P.M., for an eight o'clock breakfast next
morning, but in winter, make it up at seven P.M., and then set it on a
shelf under which a lighted coal-oil lamp is placed. If you can have a
three-cornered shelf of slate or sheet-iron, placed in a corner of the
kitchen, just above the bread block, it will be all the better, though
a common wooden shelf, made very thin, will answer, where you cannot
get the other. The coal-oil lamp underneath without running the risk
of burning the shelf (if wooden), will keep the bread gently heated
all night, and will answer the double purpose of keeping a light
burning, which most persons like to do at night, and which they can do
with scarcely any expense, by using a coal-oil lamp.

Never knead bread a second time in the morning, as this ruins it.
Handle lightly as possible, make into the desired shapes and put into
the moulds in which it is to be baked. Grease your hands before doing
this, so as to grease the loaf or each roll as you put it in, or else
dip a feather in lard and pass lightly over the bread just before
putting it in the oven to bake. Let it be a little warmer during the
second rise than during the first. Always shape and put in the moulds
two hours before breakfast. If hot bread is desired for dinner,
reserve part of the breakfast dough, keeping it in the kitchen in
winter, and in the refrigerator in summer till two hours before
dinner.

In baking, set the bread on the floor of the stove or range, never on
the shelf. Always turn up the damper before baking any kind of bread.
As you set the bread in the stove, lay a piece of stiff writing paper
over it to keep it from browning before heating through. Leave the
door ajar a few minutes, then remove the paper and shut the door. When
the top of the loaf is a light amber color, put back the paper that
the bread may not brown too much while thoroughly baking. Turn the
mould around so that each part may be exposed to equal heat. Have an
empty baking-pan on the shelf above the bread, to prevent it from
blistering: some persons fill the pan with water, but I think this is
a bad plan, as the vapor injures the bread. When thoroughly done, wrap
the bread a few moments in a clean, thick, bread towel and send to the
table with a napkin over it, to be kept on till each person has taken
his seat at table.

I would suggest to housekeepers to have made at a tinner's, a
sheet-iron shape for bread, eight inches long, four and one-half
inches wide, and five and one-half deep. This is somewhat like a
brickbat in shape, only deeper, and is very desirable for bread that
is to be cut in slices, and also for bread that is to be pulled off in
slices. A quart of flour will make eight large rolls, six inches high,
for this mould, and three or four turnovers. It is a nice plan after
making out the eight rolls to roll them with greased hands till each
one will reach across the pan (four and one-half inches), making eight
slices of bread which will pull off beautifully when well done, and
thus save the task of slicing with a knife. It requires an hour to
bake this bread properly.

Do not constantly make bread in the same shapes: each morning, try to
have some variation. Plain light bread dough may be made into loaves,
rolls, twist, turnovers, light biscuit, etc., and these changes of
shape make a pleasant and appetizing variety in the appearance of the
table. The addition of three eggs to plain light bread dough will
enable you to make French rolls, muffins, or Sally-Lunn of it. As
bread is far more appetizing, baked in pretty shapes, I would suggest
the snow-ball shape for muffins and egg bread. Very pretty iron shapes
(eight or twelve in a group, joined together) may be procured from
almost any tinner.

If you should have indifferent flour of which you cannot get rid, bear
in mind that it will sometimes make excellent beaten biscuit when it
will not make good light bread. In making beaten biscuit, always put
one teaspoonful of salt, a piece of lard the size of an egg, and a
teacup of milk to a quart of flour, adding enough cold water to make a
stiff dough: no other ingredients are admissible. Make the dough much
stiffer than for other breads, beat steadily a half hour, _by the
clock_. Cut with a biscuit cutter or shape by hand, being careful to
have the shape of each alike and perfect. Make them not quite half an
inch thick, as they rise in baking. Do not let them touch each other
in the pan, and let the oven be very hot. It is well not to have
beaten biscuit and light bread baked at the same time, as they require
different degrees of heat. When two kinds of bread are required, try
to have two such as require the same amount of heat. Egg bread and
corn muffins require the same degree of heat as beaten biscuit, while
Sally-Lunn and muffins need the same as light bread.

There is no reason why the poor man should not have as well prepared
and palatable food as the wealthy, for, by care and pains, the finest
bread may be made of the simplest materials, and surely the loving
hands of the poor man's wife and daughter will take as much pains to
make his bread nice and light as hirelings will do for the wealthy.
The mistake generally made by persons in restricted circumstances is
to make too great a use of soda bread, which is not only less
wholesome, but is more expensive than light bread or beaten biscuit,
as it requires more ingredients. The bread, coffee and meat, which
constitute the poor man's breakfast, properly cooked, furnish a meal
fit for a prince.

The furnishing of the kitchen is so important that I must here say a
few words on the subject. First, the housekeeper must have a good
stove or range, and it is well for her to have the dealer at hand when
it is put up, to see that it draws well. Besides the utensils
furnished with the range or stove, she must provide every kitchen
utensil needed in cooking. She must have a kitchen safe,--a bread
block in the corner, furnished with a heavy iron beater; trays,
sifters (with iron rims) steamers, colanders, a porcelain preserving
kettle, perforated skimmers and spoons, ladles, long-handled iron
forks and spoons, sharp knives and skewers, graters, egg beaters (the
Dover is the best), plenty of extra bread pans, dippers and tins of
every kind, iron moulds for egg bread and muffins, wash pans, tea
towels, bread towels, and hand towels, plates, knives, forks and
spoons for use of the servants, a pepper box, salt box and dredge box
(filled), a match safe, and last, but not least, a clock. Try as far
as possible to have the utensils of metal, rather than of wood. In
cases where you cannot have cold and hot water conveyed into the
kitchen, always keep on the stove a kettle of hot water, with a clean
rag in it, in which all greasy dishes and kitchen utensils may be
washed before being rinsed in the kitchen wash pan. Always keep your
cook well supplied with soap, washing mops and coarse linen dish rags.
I have noticed that if you hem the latter, servants are not so apt to
throw them away. Insist on having each utensil cleaned immediately
after being used. Have shelves and proper places to put each article,
hooks to hang the spoons on, etc. If you cannot have an oilcloth on
your kitchen floor, have it oiled and then it may be easily and
quickly wiped over every morning. Once a week, have the kitchen and
every article in it thoroughly cleaned. First clean the pipe of the
stove, as the dust, soot and ashes fly over the kitchen and soil
everything. Then take the stove to pieces, as far as practicable,
cleaning each part, especially the bottom, as neglect of this will
prevent the bread from baking well at the bottom. After the stove is
thoroughly swept out,--oven and all, apply stove polish. I consider
"Crumbs of Comfort" the best preparation for this purpose. It comes in
small pieces, each one of which is sufficient to clean the stove once,
and is thus less apt to be wasted or thrown away by servants than
stove polish that comes in a mass. Next remove everything from the
kitchen safe and shelves, which must be scoured before replacing the
utensils belonging to them, and these too must first be scoured,
scalded, and wiped dry. Then wash the windows, and lastly the floor,
scouring the latter unless it is oiled, in which case, have it merely
wiped over.

Never let a servant take up ashes in a wooden vessel. Keep a
sheet-iron pan or scuttle for the purpose. At night, always have the
water buckets filled with water and also the kettles, setting the
latter on the stove or range, in case of sickness or any emergency
during the night. Have kindling wood at hand also, so that a fire may
be quickly made, if needed.

Sometimes a discoloration is observable in iron kettles or other iron
vessels. This may be avoided by filling them with hay before using
them. Pour water over the hay, set the vessel on the fire and let it
remain till the water boils. After this, scour in sand and ashes--then
wash in hot soap-suds, after which process, there will be no danger of
discoloration.

YEAST.

Boil one quart of Irish potatoes in three quarts of water. When done,
take out the potatoes, one by one, on a fork, peel and mash them fine,
in a tray, with a large iron spoon, leaving the boiling water on the
stove during the process. Throw in this water a handful of hops, which
must scald, not boil, as it turns the tea very dark to let the hops
boil.

Add to the mashed potatoes a heaping teacupful of powdered white sugar
and half a teacupful of salt; then slowly stir in the strained hop
tea, so that there will be no lumps. When milk-warm add a teacupful of
yeast and pour into glass fruit jars, or large, clear glass bottles,
to ferment, being careful not to close them tightly. Set in a warm
place in winter, a cool one in summer. In six hours it will be ready
for use, and at the end of that time the jar or bottle must be
securely closed. Keep in a cold room in winter, and in the
refrigerator in summer. This yeast will keep two weeks in winter and
one week in summer. Bread made from it is always sweet.--_Mrs. S. T._


IRISH POTATO YEAST.

     1 quart of potatoes, boiled and mashed fine.
     1 teaspoonful of salt.
     1/2 teacup of sugar.

Put two cups of flour in a bowl, and pour over it three cups of strong
hop-water, scalding hot, and stir it briskly.

Then put all the ingredients in a jar together, and when cool enough,
add a cup of yeast, or leaven.

Set it by the fire to rise.

It will be ready for use in five or six hours.--_Mrs. E._


_Another Recipe for Yeast._

     12 large potatoes, boiled and mashed fine.
     1 teacup of brown sugar.
     1 teacup of salt.
     1 gallon of hop tea.

Mix the ingredients well, and when milk-warm, add a pint of yeast. Set
it in a warm place to rise. Put one teacupful of this yeast, when
risen, to two quarts of flour.--_Mrs. Dr. S._


_Yeast that Never Fails._

Boil twelve potatoes in four quarts of water till reduced to three
quarts.

Then take out and mash the potatoes, and throw into the water three
handfuls of hops.

When the hops have boiled to a good tea, strain the water over the
potatoes, a small quantity at a time, mixing them well together.

     Add one teacup of brown sugar.
     1 teacup of salt.
     1 tablespoonful of ground ginger.

When milk-warm, add yeast of the same sort to make it rise.

Put it in bottles, or a jug, leaving it uncorked for a day.

Set it in a cool place.

Put two large tablespoonfuls of it to a quart of flour, and when
making up, boil a potato and mix with it.

This yeast never sours, and is good as long as it lasts.--_Mrs. A. F._


ALUM YEAST.

On one pint of flour pour enough boiling water to make a thick batter,
stirring it until perfectly smooth, and then let it stand till
milk-warm.

     Then add a teaspoonful of powdered alum.
     1 teaspoonful of salt.
     1 tablespoonful of sugar.
     Half a teacup of yeast.

After it ferments, add enough meal to make it a stiff dough.

Let it stand till it works, and then spread it in the shade to dry.

To a quart of flour put a tablespoonful of crumbs.--_Mrs. P._


LEAVEN.

     2 tablespoonfuls of flour.
     1 tablespoonful of lard or butter.
     2 tablespoonfuls of yeast.
     2 eggs.
     1 potato.
     2 teaspoonfuls of sugar.

Make the leaven soon after breakfast in winter, and at one o'clock
P.M. in summer. Let it be of the consistency of batter. Put it in a
small bucket, in a warm place, to rise till four o'clock P.M. This
amount of leaven is sufficient for two quarts of flour. If for loaf
bread, leave out the eggs and butter.--_Mrs. M._


EXCELLENT BREAD FOR BREAKFAST.

     1 quart of flour.
     Lard the size of a walnut.
     1 small Irish potato, boiled and mashed fine.
     1 heaping teaspoonful of salt.
     Half a teacup of good yeast, into which put a tablespoonful of
       white sugar.

Make up a soft dough with cold water in summer and milk-warm water in
winter. This must be kneaded for thirty minutes, and then set to rise,
in a cool place in summer, and a warm one in winter; must never be
kept more than milk-warm.

Two hours before breakfast, make the dough into the desired shapes,
handling it lightly, _without kneading it_, first rubbing lard over
the hands, and taking especial care to grease the bread on top. Then
set it to rise again.

Thirty minutes are sufficient for baking it, unless it be in the form
of a loaf or rolls, in which case, it must be baked fifteen minutes
longer. Excellent muffins may be made by the above receipt, adding two
eggs well beaten, so that from the same batch of dough both plain
bread and muffins may be made.

Iron moulds are best for baking.

For those who prefer warm bread for dinner, it is a good plan to
reserve a portion of the breakfast dough, setting it away in a cool
place till two hours before dinner, then make into turnovers or twist,
set it to rise and bake it for dinner, as for breakfast. Very nice on
a cold day, and greatly preferable to warmed-over bread.--_Mrs. S. T._


RECIPE FOR FAMILY BREAD.

     2 quarts of flour.
     2 tablespoonfuls of lard or butter.
     2 teaspoonfuls of salt.
     Enough sponge for a two-quart loaf of bread.
     Mix with one pint of sweet milk.

Make into rolls and bake with very little fire under the oven.--_Mrs.
A. C._


LOAF BREAD.

First make a batter of the following ingredients.

     1 pint of flour.
     1 teaspoonful of salt.
     1 teaspoonful of sugar.
     A cup of water.
     A cup of good yeast.

Set this to rise and when risen work in two pints of flour, or, if the
batter is not sufficient to work up this flour, add a little water.

Work it smoothly and set it to rise.

When risen, add a small piece of lard, work it well again, let it
stand an hour and then bake it slowly.--_Mrs. P. W._


OLD VIRGINIA LOAF BREAD.

Sponge for the same.

Boil one large Irish potato, until well done, then peel and mash it
fine, adding a little cold water to soften it. Stir into it

     1 teaspoonful of brown sugar.
     1 tablespoonful of sweet lard.

Then add three tablespoonfuls of good hop yeast.

Mix the ingredients thoroughly, then put the sponge in a mug with a
close-fitting top, and let it stand several hours to rise.

Sift into the tray three pints of the best family flour, to which add
a teaspoonful of salt. Then pour in the sponge and add enough cold
water to the flour to work it up into a rather stiff dough. Knead it
till the dough is smooth, then let it stand all night to rise. Work it
over in the morning, using just enough flour to keep it from sticking
to the hands. Allow it one hour to rise before baking and one hour to
bake in a moderate oven. Then it will be thoroughly done and well
dried.

Use a little lard on the hands when making out the loaf, as it keeps
the crust from being too hard.--_Mrs. S._


_Another Recipe for Loaf Bread._

Good flour is the first requisite, and next, good yeast and sufficient
kneading.

For a loaf of ordinary size, use

     2 lbs. of flour.
     Lard the size of a hen's egg.
     A saltspoonful of salt.
     2 gills of yeast.

Mix up these ingredients into a moderately stiff dough, using for the
purpose, from three gills to a pint of water. Some flour being more
adhesive than others, you have to learn by experience the exact amount
of water required.

Knead the dough till perfectly smooth, then set it to rise, in a cool
place, in summer, but in a warm place, free from draughts, in winter.
In the latter season it is better to keep a blanket wrapped around it.

This amount of flour will rise to the top of a gallon and a half jar
or bucket. If it is ready before time, stir it down and set it in a
cooler place.

When you put it in the baking-pan (in which it will be in an inch of
the top, if the pan be of a suitable size for the amount of flour)
cover it well, or a hard crust will form from the effects of the
atmosphere. Keep it a little warmer during the second rise than during
the first. When ready for baking, set it in the oven and bake it for
three-quarters of an hour with a moderate fire, evenly kept up. It
will then come out without sticking, if the pans are well cared
for.--_Mrs. J. J. A._


LIGHT BREAD.

     2 quarts of flour.
     1 teaspoonful of sugar.
     1 teaspoonful of salt.
     Half a teacup of yeast.
     One egg, well beaten.
     1 pint of water.

Sift the flour and divide it into three parts. Mix one third in the
batter, one third in the jar to rise in, and pour the other third over
the batter. Let it stand two hours and then work it well, adding a
small piece of lard before baking.--_Mrs. Dr. S._


RECIPE FOR HOT ROLLS OR COLD LOAF BREAD.

Mix the following ingredients.

     Four pints of flour.
     1 pint of fresh milk.
     2 eggs, well beaten.
     1 large tablespoonful of melted lard.
     1 large tablespoonful of hop yeast.

Set it to rise at eleven o'clock in the morning, for early tea. Make
into rolls at five o'clock P.M., and bake as soon as risen. In cool
weather, set before the fire, both before and after making it into
rolls.--_Mrs. S._


FRENCH ROLLS.

     1 quart of flour.
     1 teaspoonful of salt.
     2 eggs.
     1 large tablespoonful of lard.
     2 tablespoonfuls of yeast.

Work and knead it well at night, and in the morning work it well
again, make it into rolls, put them in the oven to take a second rise,
and when risen, bake them.--_Mrs. Col. W._


_Another Recipe for French Rolls._

     3 pints of flour.
     1 gill of yeast.
     1 egg (beaten up).
     1 tablespoonful of butter.

Mix up with milk and warm water and set to rise.--_Mrs. Dr. E._


_Another Recipe for French Rolls or Twist._

     1 quart of lukewarm milk.
     1 teaspoonful of salt.
     1 teacup of yeast.
     Enough flour to make a stiff batter.

When very light, add one beaten egg and two teaspoonfuls of butter,
and knead in the flour till stiff enough to roll. Let it rise a second
time, and, when very light, roll out, cut in strips and braid it. Bake
thirty minutes, on buttered tins.--_Mrs. S._


VELVET ROLLS.

     Three pints of flour.
     Two eggs.
     One teacup of sweet milk.
     One teacup of yeast.
     1 tablespoonful of lard, and the same of butter.

Mix well and beat the dough till it blisters.

Let it rise, work in a small quantity of flour, beat as before and
make into rolls. After the second rising, bake quickly.--_Mrs. Dr. S._


POCKETBOOK ROLLS.

     1 quart of flour.
     1 teaspoonful of salt.
     2 teaspoonfuls of sugar.
     2 tablespoonfuls of lard.
     3 tablespoonfuls of yeast.
     2 eggs.

Mix up these ingredients with warm water, making up the dough at ten
A.M. in summer and eight A.M. in winter. Put in half the lard when it
is first worked up, and at the second working put in the rest of the
lard and a little more flour.

Roll out the dough in strips as long and wide as your hand, spread
with butter and roll up like a pocketbook. Put them in buttered tins,
and, when they are light, bake them a light brown--_Mrs. L. C. C._


TURNOVERS.

     1 quart of flour.
     1 large Irish potato, boiled and mashed.
     3 eggs.
     1 tablespoonful of butter or lard.
     2 tablespoonfuls of yeast.
     1 teacup of milk.

Rub the potato in the flour, then the lard and other ingredients,
making it into a soft dough. Then set it to rise, at night if you wish
it for breakfast next morning. Early in the morning, take off a piece
of dough, the size of a biscuit, roll it out, about five inches long,
then turn it about half over. When you have made up all the dough, in
shapes like this, place them on a dish or board, cover with a napkin
and set aside for a second rising. When ready to bake, dip a feather
in water and pass over them to prevent the crust being too hard. If
the dough should be sour, knead in a little soda, which will correct
it--_Mrs. A. C._


_Another Recipe for Turnovers._

     1 quart of flour.
     4 eggs.
     1 tablespoonful of lard or butter.
     1 tablespoonful of yeast.

Set it to rise, then make them up round and flat, greasing the upper
side with lard and turning over one side. When well risen the second
time, bake--_Mrs. I._


TWIST.

From the dough of loaf bread or French rolls, reserve enough to make
two long strips or rolls, say, fifteen inches long and one inch in
diameter. Rub lard well between the hands before handling and shaping
these strips. Pinch the two ends so as to make them stick together.
Twist them, pressing the other ends together to prevent
unrolling.--_Mrs. S. T._


POCKETS.

     1 quart of flour.
     4 eggs.
     1 cup of butter.
     1 cup of yeast.
     1 large Irish potato, boiled and mashed into the flour.

Add the yeast, butter and eggs, after mashing the potato in the flour.
Knead all together and set to rise.


SALLY-LUNN.

     1 quart of flour.
     1 teaspoonful of salt.
     1 tablespoonful of white sugar.
     Rub in a heaping tablespoonful of butter and lard in equal parts,
       then rub in an Irish potato, mashed fine.
     Half a teacup of yeast.
     3 eggs well beaten.

Make up the dough to the consistency of light bread dough, with warm
water in winter, and cold in summer. Knead half an hour. When it has
risen light, handle lightly, put into a cake-mould and bake without a
second kneading.--_Mrs. S. T._


_Another Recipe for Sally-Lunn._

     1 quart of flour.
     1 tablespoonful of yeast.
     4 eggs well beaten.
     2 oz. of butter or lard.
     1 pint of milk.

Set it to rise in the pan in which it is to be baked.--_Mrs. A. C._


_Another Recipe for Sally-Lunn._

     3 pints of flour.
     1 tablespoonful of butter and the same of lard.
     3 eggs.
     1 light teacup of yeast.
     2 large tablespoonfuls of sugar.

Use as much milk in mixing as will make a soft dough. Work this well,
as it gets only one working. Then grease it, put it in a greased pan,
and set it in a warm place to rise. Bake about an hour.--_Mrs. Dr. T._


_Recipe for the Same._

     1 quart of flour.
     3 tablespoonfuls of yeast.
     3 eggs.
     1 saltspoonful of salt.
     Butter the size of an egg.

Make up with new milk into a tolerably stiff batter. Set it to rise
and when risen pour into a mould and set to rise again, as light
bread. Bake quickly.--_Mrs. L._


QUICK SALLY-LUNN.

     1 quart of flour.
     Half cup of butter.
     2 eggs.
     2 cups of milk.
     Two teaspoonfuls of cream of tartar.
     1 teaspoonful of soda.
     2 tablespoonfuls of sugar.
     1 saltspoonful of salt.

Bake fifteen minutes.--_Mrs. Dr. S._


MUFFINS.

     1 quart of flour.
     6 eggs, beaten very light.
     2 tablespoonfuls of butter.
     2 tablespoonfuls of yeast.--_Mrs. Dr. E._


SWEET SPRING MUFFINS.

Sift three good pints of flour. Beat well six eggs, leaving out one
and a half of the whites. Then beat into them as much flour as they
will take in; then add milk and flour alternately (beating all the
while) till all the flour is used. Add five tablespoonfuls of yeast,
and when this batter is well beaten, stir into it two ounces of melted
butter, cooled but liquid. The batter must be as stiff as can be
beaten with an iron spoon. Bake in a hot oven.--_Mrs. L._


SALT SULPHUR MUFFINS.

Work together, about twelve o'clock in the day, one pint of yeast,
half a pint of water, six eggs, one pound of butter and enough flour
to make a dough just stiff enough not to stick to the fingers. After
the dough is risen, make it out in biscuit and allow half an hour or
more for them to rise before baking.--_Mrs. L._


SUPERIOR MUFFINS.

     1 quart of flour.
     1 teaspoonful of salt.
     1 tablespoonful of white sugar.

Rub in one heaping tablespoonful of butter and lard mixed, and one
tablespoonful of Irish potato, mashed free from lumps.

Pour in three well beaten eggs and a half teacup of yeast. Make into a
soft dough with warm water in winter and cold in summer. Knead well
for half an hour. Set to rise where it will be milk-warm, in winter,
and cool in summer. If wanted for an eight o'clock winter breakfast,
make up at eight o'clock the night before. At six o'clock in the
morning, make out into round balls (without kneading again), and drop
into snow-ball moulds that have been well greased. Take care also to
grease the hands and pass them over the tops of the muffins. Set them
in a warm place for two hours and then bake.

These are the best muffins I ever ate.--_Mrs. S. T._


PARKER HOUSE MUFFINS.

Boil one quart of milk. When nearly cool stir in one quart sifted

Beat two eggs very light in a bowl. Add one teacup of clabber, one of
water, one of corn meal, a teacup of flour, one-half teaspoonful of
salt. Just before baking, sift in half a teaspoonful of soda and stir
well. It is better to grease the griddle with fat bacon than with
lard.

The above proportions will make enough batter cakes for two or three
persons.--_Mrs. S. T._


_Another Recipe for the Same._

     1 quart sweet milk.
     1 heaping pint corn meal.
     4 eggs.
     1 teaspoonful of salt.
     Half teaspoonful of soda.
     1 tablespoonful of warmed butter or fresh lard.

Break the eggs, whites and yolks together, beat slightly, then add the
milk, stir in the meal and beat until it looks light. Bake on a
griddle.--_Mrs. J. P._


_Cheap Recipe for Batter Cakes._

     1 pint of sour milk.
     1 teaspoonful of soda.
     1 tablespoonful of flour.
     Enough meal to make a good batter.

Bake on a hoe.--_Miss E. P._


INDIAN GRIDDLE CAKES.

     1 quart of sour milk.
     1 large tablespoonful of butter, melted after measuring.
     2 eggs.
     1 teaspoonful of soda.
     Half a teaspoonful of salt.

Make a thin batter, with two-thirds Indian meal, and one-third flour.

A small bag made of coarse but thin linen or cotton, and filled with
common salt, is much better to rub over the griddle than lard, when
cakes are to be fried or baked.


BATTER BREAD.

Break two eggs into a bowl. Beat to a stiff froth. Pour in one teacup
of clabber or butter-milk, one of water, one of corn meal, one of
flour, half teaspoonful of salt, a heaping teaspoonful of butter
melted. Beat all well together. Have already heated on the stove or
range, iron-clad muffin moulds (eight or ten in a group). Grease them
well with a clean rag, dipped in lard. Fill each one nearly full with
the batter, first sifting in half a teaspoonful soda. Set in a hot
oven and bake a nice brown. Oblong shapes are the nicest. If
preferred, sweet milk may be used instead of sour milk and water. In
this case add another egg and dispense with the soda.--_Mrs. S. T._


BATTER BREAD.

Four cups of meal, two cups sweet milk, four eggs, two tablespoonfuls
flour, one tablespoonful lard, one teaspoonful salt, half teaspoonful
soda.--_Mrs. F._


BATTER BREAD.

One cup meal, one cup sweet milk, one cup butter-milk, two eggs, one
tablespoonful butter, one tablespoonful flour, half teaspoonful of
salt, and same of soda. Bake in cups.--_Mrs. G._


CORN MUFFINS.

     3 eggs, beaten light.
     1 pint of buttermilk (if very sour, use less).
     1 teacup of cream or milk.
     1 small teaspoonful of soda.
     Lard or butter size of an egg.

Meal enough to make the batter of the consistency of pound-cake
batter.--_Mrs. I._


CORN MEAL WAFFLES.

One pint of corn meal scalded. While hot add to it, two tablespoonfuls
of lard or butter, three well beaten eggs, a cup of boiled rice, a
pint of flour, a teaspoonful of salt. Thin to the proper consistency
with milk.--_Mrs. Dr. S._


ST. NICHOLAS' PONE.

     1 quart of meal.
     1 quart of milk.
     4 eggs.
     1 tablespoonful of melted butter.
     1 teaspoonful of salt.
     2 teaspoonfuls cream of tartar.
     1 teaspoonful of soda.--_Mrs. C. C._


GRIT OR HOMINY BREAD.

     2 eggs, beaten separately.
     1 pint of milk.
     Small piece of butter.

Add enough meal and hominy to make a batter, and bake quickly.--_Mrs.
C. L. T._


HOMINY BREAD.

Mix with two teacups of hot hominy a very large spoonful of butter.
Beat two eggs very light and stir into the hominy. Next add a pint of
milk, gradually stirring it in. Lastly, add half a pint of corn meal.
The batter should be of the consistency of rich boiled custard. If
thicker, add a little more milk. Bake with a good deal of heat at the
bottom, but not so much at the top. Bake in a deep pan, allowing space
for rising. When done, it looks like a baked batter pudding.--_Mrs. F.
D._


CORN CAKE.

     1 pint of corn meal.
     1 pint of sweet milk.
     2 eggs.
     1 tablespoonful of butter.
     2 tablespoonfuls of flour.
     1 teaspoonful of salt.

Boil the milk and pour it over the meal, flour, and butter. Beat
light. When cool, add eggs well beaten. Bake in a buttered pan.--_Mrs.
G. W. P._


MUSH BREAD.

Make a thin mush of corn meal and milk (or hot water, if milk is
scarce). Cook till perfectly done, stirring all the time to keep it
smooth. Then add a good lump of butter; and, after it cools a little,
two eggs, one at a time. Beat in a very small pinch of soda and a
little salt.

Butter a yellow dish and bake slowly till brown.--_Mrs. C. L. T._


LIGHT CORN BREAD.

Pour one quart of boiled milk over one pint of corn meal. Add a
teaspoonful of salt, a teaspoonful of cream of tartar, half
teaspoonful of soda, three well beaten eggs, four tablespoonfuls of
flour, a little butter.--_Miss E. P._


SOFT EGG BREAD.

     1 quart of milk.
     Half pint of meal.
     3 eggs.
     Large spoonful of butter.

Make in a pudding dish. Rice is an improvement to the above.--_Mrs.
P._


OLD-FASHIONED EGG BREAD.

     1 pint of meal.
     3 eggs well beaten.
     1 teaspoonful of salt.
     1 tablespoonful melted butter.

Add enough sweet milk to make a rather thin batter. Bake
quickly.--_Mrs. S. T._


_Another Recipe for Egg Bread._

     1 quart of milk.
     3 eggs.
     1 tablespoonful of butter.
     1 pint of corn meal.
     1 teaspoonful of salt.

Beat the eggs very light and add to the other ingredients. Bake in a
pan or dish. Add a little soda dissolved in milk, if you desire
it.--_Mrs. I. H._


INDIAN BREAD.

Beat two eggs very light, mix alternately with them one pint of sour
milk or buttermilk, and one pint of fine corn meal. Melt one
tablespoonful of butter, and add to the mixture. Dissolve one
teaspoonful of soda in a small portion of the milk, and add to the
other ingredients, last of all. Beat hard and bake in a pan, in a hot
oven.


RICE BREAD.

     1 pint sweet milk.
     1 teacup boiled rice.
     2 teacups sifted corn meal,
     1/2 teacup melted butter.
     3 eggs, beaten separately,
     1/2 teaspoonful salt.

Bake in a very hot oven, using buttered iron muffin moulds.--_Mrs. S.
T._


CRACKLIN BREAD.

Take one quart sifted corn meal and a teacup of cracklins. Rub the
latter in the meal as fine as you can. Add a teaspoonful of salt and
make up with warm water into a stiff dough. Make into pones, and eat
hot.--_Mrs. P. W._


VIRGINIA ASH CAKE.

Add a teaspoonful of salt to a quart of sifted corn meal. Make up with
water and knead well. Make into round, flat cakes. Sweep a clean place
on the hottest part of the hearth. Put the cake on it and cover it
with hot wood ashes.

Wash and wipe it dry, before eating it. Sometimes a cabbage leaf is
placed under it, and one over it, before baking, in which case it need
not be washed.--_Mrs. S. T._


PLAIN CORN BREAD.

     1 pint sifted meal.
     1 teaspoonful salt.
     Cold water sufficient to make a stiff dough.

Work well with the hands, pat out in long, narrow pones, six or seven
inches long and as wide as the wrist. Bake quickly in a hot
pan.--_Mrs. P. W._




COFFEE, TEA, AND CHOCOLATE.


TO TOAST COFFEE.

Wash and pick the coffee, put it in a very large stove-pan in a hot
oven. Stir often, giving constant attention. It must be toasted the
darkest brown, yet not one grain must be burned. It should never be
glazed, as this destroys the aroma.

Two pints of coffee become three pints after toasting.--_Mrs. S. T._


BOILED COFFEE.

To one quart of boiling water (poured in after scalding the pot) stir
in three gills of coffee, not ground too fine. Boil twenty minutes,
scraping from the sides and stirring occasionally. Five minutes before
breakfast, scrape from the spout, pour out half a teacupful, and
return to the pot. Do this a second time. Set it with the side of the
pot to the fire, so that it will be just at the boiling point. Do not
let it boil, however. Serve in the same coffee-pot.

Coffee should never be glazed.

Have a liberal supply of thick, sweet cream, also of boiled milk, to
serve with the coffee.

If the members of the family drop in at intervals, it is well to keep
the coffee over a round iron weight, heated just enough to keep the
coffee hot, without boiling it. This answers better than a spirit lamp
for keeping coffee hot.--_Mrs. S. T._


COFFEE.

Take equal quantities of Mocha, Java, Laguayra and Rio coffee. Have
the coffee roasted a chestnut brown. To every twelve cups of coffee to
be drawn, use eighteen heaping tablespoons of the ground coffee. Have
the water boiling hot, scald the biggin or percolator, put the ground
coffee in the upper part, then pour on some boiling water for it to
draw--about two teacups if you are to make twelve cups of coffee. Let
it stand a few moments and pour again into the upper part of the
percolator the first drawn coffee. Then add, one by one, the cups of
boiling water required. It will take ten minutes for the coffee to be
ready for the table.

Use the best white sugar, and in winter let the milk stand twenty-four
hours for the cream to rise. Use together with rich cream, a cream jug
of boiling sweet milk.--_Mrs. M. C. C._


_Coffee._

Buy Java and Laguayra mixed, two-thirds Java and one-third Laguayra,
which will give a delightful aroma to the Java.

Scald the pot. Then put in a teacup of coarsely ground coffee,
parched a light brown and mixed with cold water till it forms a paste,
to six cups of boiling water. Before you put in the boiling water, add
to the grounds one or more egg-shells or whites of eggs, to keep it
clear. Let it boil ten or fifteen minutes. Before taking it off the
fire, drop in about a teaspoonful of cold water, which will settle all
the floating grounds.--_Mrs. J. P._


DRIPPED OR FILTERED COFFEE.

If one quart of coffee is desired, grind three gills of coffee, put it
in the filterer and pour boiling water over it. If not sufficiently
strong, pour out and return to the filterer. Then set on the fire and
boil up, taking from the fire immediately.--_Mrs. S. T._


DRIPPED COFFEE.

One-half pint Java coffee ground and put in the dripper. Pour over it
two and one-half pints boiling water. If not strong enough, pass
through the dripper a second time.--_Mrs. J. R. McD._


CAFE AU LAIT.

     1 cup German chiccory.
     2 cups ground coffee.

Put in three pints boiling water with a pinch of isinglass, boil five
minutes and allow it to settle, or, if made in a percolator it will be
better. Use three-quarters of a cup boiling milk and one-quarter of
strong coffee, with sugar to suit the taste.--_Mrs. J. W. S._


GREEN TEA.

Scald the teapot, and add one-half pint boiling water to two
teaspoonfuls of the best green tea. Set it where it will keep hot, but
not boil. When it has drawn fifteen or twenty minutes, add boiling
water till it has the strength desired.--_Mrs. J. R. McD._


_Green Tea._

Scald the teapot. If you wish a pint of tea, put in one heaping
teaspoonful tea after putting in a pint boiling water. Set this where
it will keep hot, but not quite boil.--_Mrs. S. T._


_A good Cup of Green Tea._

Before putting in any water, set the teapot with the tea in it before
the fire and let it get thoroughly hot. Then fill the pot with boiling
water and let it stand five minutes.--_Mrs. M. E. L. W._


BLACK TEA.

If you wish a quart of tea, put that quantity of boiling water into
the teapot, after scalding it. Add four teaspoonfuls of tea. Boil
twenty minutes. It is a great improvement to put in a little green
tea.--_Mrs. S. T._


_Black Tea._

Add one and one-half pint boiling water to a half-teacupful of the
best black tea. Boil gently for ten or fifteen minutes. If too strong,
weaken with boiling water.--_Mrs. J. R. McD._


ICED TEA.

After scalding the teapot, put into it one quart of boiling water and
two teaspoonfuls green tea. If wanted for supper, do this at
breakfast. At dinner time, strain, without stirring, through a
tea-strainer into a pitcher. Let it stand till tea time and then pour
into decanters, leaving the sediment in the bottom of the pitcher.
Fill the goblets with ice, put two teaspoonfuls granulated sugar in
each, and pour the tea over the ice and sugar. A squeeze of lemon will
make this delicious and healthful, as it will correct the astringent
tendency.--_Mrs. S. T._


CHOCOLATE.

Scrape fine one square of Baker's chocolate (which will be an ounce).
Put it in a pint of boiling water and milk, mixed in equal parts. Boil
it ten minutes, and during this time mill it or whip it with a Dover
egg-whip (one with a wheel), which will make it foam beautifully.
Sweeten to the taste, at table.--_Mrs. S. T._


COCOA.

To one pint milk and one pint cold water add three tablespoonfuls
grated cocoa. Boil fifteen or twenty minutes, milling or whipping as
directed in foregoing recipe. Sweeten to taste, at the table. Some
persons like a piece of orange-peel boiled with it.--_Mrs. S. T._


BROMA.

Dissolve one large tablespoonful broma in one tablespoonful warm
water. Pour on it one pint boiling milk and water (equal parts). Boil
ten minutes, milling or whipping as above directed. Sweeten to the
taste.--_Mrs. S. T._

A cream-pitcher of whipped cream should always accompany chocolate or
any preparation of it, such as cocoa or broma.--_Mrs. S. T._




MILK AND BUTTER.


The most exquisite nicety and care must be observed in the management
of milk and butter. A housekeeper should have two sets of milk vessels
(tin or earthenware, never stoneware, as this is an absorbent). She
should never use twice in succession the same milk vessels without
having them scalded and aired.

In warm weather, sweet milk should be set on ice, if practicable, or
if not, in a spring-house. Never put ice in sweet milk, as this
dilutes it. One pan of milk should always be set aside to raise cream
for coffee. A bucket with a close-fitting lid should be filled with
milk and set aside for dinner, one for supper, one for breakfast, and
a fourth for cooking purposes.

For making butter, strain unskimmed milk into a scalded churn, where
the churning is done daily. This will give sweeter butter and nicer
buttermilk than when cream is skimmed and kept for churning, as this
sometimes gives a cheesy taste to the butter. Do not let the milk in
the churn exceed blood heat. If overheated, the butter will be white
and frothy, and the milk thin and sour. Churn as soon as the milk is
turned. In summer try to churn early in the morning, as fewer flies
are swarming then, and the butter can be made much firmer.

A stone churn is in some respects more convenient than a wooden churn;
but no matter which you use, the most fastidious neatness must be
observed. Have the churn scalded and set out to sun as soon as
possible after churning. Use your last made butter for buttering
bread, reserving the staler for cookery.

Butter should be printed early in the morning, while it is cool. A
plateful for each of the three meals should be placed in the
refrigerator ready for use. Do not set butter in a refrigerator with
anything else in it but milk, or in a safe with anything but milk. It
readily imbibes the flavor of everything near it. After churning,
butter should be taken up in what is called "a piggin," first scalded
and then filled with cold water. With an old-fashioned butter-stick
(scalded) wash and press the butter till no water is left. Then add a
little salt, finely beaten. Beat again in a few hours, and make up in
half-pound prints. I would advise all housekeepers (even those who do
not make their own butter) to keep a piggin, a butter-stick, and a
pretty butter-print.


_To secure nice Butter for the Table in Winter._

In October and November, engage butter to be brought weekly, fresh
from the churn in rolls. Wrap each roll in a piece of old table cloth,
and put in a sweet firkin or stone jar which has been washed with soda
water, scalded and sunned for a month before using. Pour over it a
clear strong brine, which also must have been prepared at least a week
beforehand, by pouring off the settlings and repeated strainings. Have
a nice flat rock washed and weight the butter down with it, being
careful to keep it always under the brine.--_Mrs. S. T._


_Recipe for Putting up Butter._

     2 quarts best common salt.
     1 ounce pulverized saltpetre.
     1 ounce white sugar.

Work the butter over three times, the last time adding an ounce of the
above mixture to every pound butter. Of course, the butter is salted,
when first made. Make the butter into rolls and wrap in cloths or pack
in jars, within four inches of the top of each jar. If the latter is
done, fill the jars with brine and tie up closely. If the former is
preferred, drop the rolls into brine, prepared as follows:

To every gallon brine that will bear an egg, add one pound white sugar
and one-half ounce saltpetre. Boil well and skim. Keep the brine
closely covered. I have used butter on my table in May, put up in this
way, and it tasted as well as when put up in October.--_Mrs. R. C._


CLABBER.

To have clabber in perfection, place in small glass dishes or bowls
enough milk to make clabber for each person. After it has turned, set
it in the refrigerator, if in summer, till called for. By the way,
refrigerators (as well as water-coolers) should be washed every
morning with water in which a tablespoonful of common soda has been
dissolved. They should then be aired before filling with ice for the
day.--_Mrs. S. T._


COTTAGE CHEESE.

When the tea-kettle boils, pour the water into a pan of "loppered"
milk. It will curd at once. Stir it and turn it into a colander, pour
a little cold water over it, salt it and break it up. A better way is
to put equal parts of buttermilk and thick milk in a kettle, over the
fire, heat it almost boiling hot, pour into a linen bag and let it
drain till next day. Then take it out, salt it, put in a little cream
or butter, as it may be thick or not, and make it up into balls the
size of an orange.




SOUP.


As making soup is a tedious process, it is best to make enough at once
to last several days. Beef shank is most generally used in making
nutritious soup. It is best to get this the day before using it, and
soak it all night in cold, clear water. If you cannot do this,
however, get it as early in the morning as you can. Break the bones,
wash it, soak it a few minutes in weak salt and water, and put it in a
large boiler of cold water. As soon as it begins to simmer, remove the
dark scum that rises on top. Keep the boiler closely covered, and boil
very slowly till an hour or two before dinner. Then, with a ladle,
remove all the fat from the top, as it is this element that makes soup
unwholesome. Strain and season, or, if you prefer, season just enough
for one meal, reserving the rest as foundation for another sort of
soup. It is well always to keep some of this stock on hand in cold
weather, as by the addition of a can of tomatoes, or other
ingredients, a delicious soup may be quickly made of it. Never throw
away water in which any sort of meat has been boiled, as it is much
better to simmer hash or a stew in this liquor than in water, and it
is also invaluable for basting fowls or meats that have not been
parboiled.

Directions for soup making are so fully given in the following pages
that it is needless for me to say anything further on the subject
here.


OYSTER SOUP.

     100 oysters.
     1 teaspoonful salt.
     1 tablespoonful black pepper.
     1/4 pound butter.
     Yolks of 3 eggs.
     1 pint rich milk, perfectly fresh.
     3 tablespoonfuls flour.

Separate the oysters from the liquor: put the liquor to boil, when
boiled add salt, pepper and butter, then the flour, having previously
made it into a batter. Stir all the time. When it comes to a boil, add
the eggs well beaten, then the milk, and when the mixture reaches a
boil, put in the oysters; let them also just boil, and the soup is
done. Stir all the time to prevent curdling.--_Mrs. Judge M._


ECONOMICAL OYSTER SOUP.

     1 quart oysters.
     2 quarts water.
     Boil with salt and pepper.

Cut up one tablespoonful butter with flour and put in while boiling;
beat the yolks of four eggs light, mix them with one-half pint milk.

When the oysters are well cooked, pour on the milk and eggs, stirring
all the time. Let it boil up, and take off quickly, and pour into the
tureen, over toasted bread cut into dice--if preferred rich, leave out
some of the water.--_Mrs. Lt.-Gov. M._


OYSTER SOUP.

Empty the oysters into a colander and drain off all the liquor; then
strain the liquor through a very coarse cloth to rid it of all scum,
etc. To a whole can of oysters take a quart of milk.

Put the milk, oyster liquor, one level tablespoonful flour rubbed very
smooth with one heaping tablespoonful of butter, one tablespoonful
salt, one-half teaspoonful pepper, all on the fire together in a
farina-boiler (or put a skillet one-third filled with boiling water
under the saucepan, to prevent the milk burning). When it comes to a
boil, put in the oysters and let them stew for twenty minutes or till
the gill of the oyster turns and begins to ruffle and crimp at the
edge. Serve immediately, for if they are cooked too long, they become
hard, dark and tasteless. If you put the salt in last, it will not
curdle the soup. Some add one level teaspoonful whole cloves and same
of mace, tied up in a net bag, but they are little improvement.--_Mrs.
R._


PUREE OF OYSTERS.

For fifty oysters.

Put the oysters on in their own liquor--let them come to a boil--take
them out and mince them; skim the liquor when nearly done. Beat well
together:

     1 egg.
     1 dessertspoonful butter.
     1/2 pint milk.
     1 cracker sifted.
     Salt, pepper (mace, also, if liked).

Pour this into boiling liquor and then add the minced oysters. When
done, the soup is smooth. The milk must be fresh or it will
curdle.--_Mrs. John Walker, Alabama._


OYSTER SOUP.

     Take two quarts of oysters, wash them, and add,
     2 quarts water.
     A bundle of herbs.
     1 small onion sliced.

Let it boil until all the substance is out of the oysters. Strain the
liquor from the ingredients and put it back in the pot. Add a large
spoonful butter mixed with flour. Have ready two dozen oysters to
throw in just as it is ready to be dished--at the same time stir up
two yolks of eggs with a cup of cream. Cayenne pepper is an
improvement.--_Mrs. E. W._


TURTLE SOUP.

Kill the turtle at daylight in summer, the night before in winter, and
hang it up to bleed. After breakfast, scald it well and scrape the
outer skin off the shell; open it carefully, so as not to break the
gall. Break both shells to pieces and put them into the pot. Lay the
fins, the eggs and some of the more delicate parts by--put the rest
into the pot with a quantity of water to suit the size of your family.

Add two onions, parsley, thyme, salt, pepper, cloves and allspice to
suit your taste.

About half an hour before dinner thicken the soup with brown flour and
butter rubbed together. An hour before dinner, take the parts laid by,
roll them in brown flour, fry them in butter, put them and the eggs in
the soup; just before dinner add a glass of claret or Madeira
wine.--_Mrs. N._


_Turtle Soup._

To one turtle that will weigh from four to five pounds, after being
dressed, add one-half gallon water, and boil until the turtle will
drop to pieces, then add:

     2 tablespoonfuls allspice.
     1 tablespoonful black pepper.
     2 tablespoonfuls butter, and salt to the taste.

When nearly done, put in a small handful pot marjoram, thyme and
parsley tied together, and two large onions; when ready to come off,
add two sliced lemons, one pint good wine, and a small quantity of
curry powder; thicken with flour.--_Mrs. D._


_Turtle Soup._

     To 21/2 quarts soup add:
     1 ounce mace.
     1 dessertspoonful allspice.
     1 teaspoonful cloves.
     Pepper, black and cayenne, and salt to your taste.

Tie up a bunch of parsley, thyme, and onion in a cloth, and throw into
soup when boiling. When nearly done, thicken with two tablespoonfuls
flour. To give it a good color, take one tablespoonful brown sugar and
burn it; when burnt, add a wineglass of water. Of this coloring, put
two tablespoonfuls in soup, and just before serving, add half a pint
Madeira wine.--_Miss E. W._


MOCK TURTLE SOUP.

Put on beef and boil very tender; take out, chop fine, and put back to
boil. Put potatoes, mace, cloves, cinnamon, parsley, thyme, spice,
celery seed, and ten hard-boiled eggs; pepper and salt to your taste.

Thicken with flour and add brandy and wine.--_Miss E. P._


MOCK TERRAPIN SOUP.

Cut up two pounds roast or boiled beef in small pieces. Put one large
teacup new milk, one large teacup of wine, a piece of butter size of
an egg (rolled in flour), a little nutmeg, two or three spoonfuls
mixed mustard--all in a stewpan, and cook ten or fifteen minutes. Good
way to use up cold meats.--_Mrs. S. M._


CLAM SOUP.

Boil half a peck of clams fifteen minutes; then take them from the
shells, clean and wash them. Have ready the stew-kettle; strain the
water, in which clams have been boiled; chop up clams, and put in with
three or four slices of salt pork, some mashed potatoes, salt and
pepper to taste. Thicken with grated cracker, and add two spoonfuls
butter rolled in flour. Let it boil twenty minutes and serve.--_Mrs.

_Clam Soup._

Open the clams and chop them up fine. To twenty clams, add:

     1/2 gallon water.
     3 good onions.
     2 tablespoonfuls butter.
     A small bunch of parsley and thyme.

Just before taking off, add one quart rich milk and thicken with
flour.--_Mrs. D._


CRAB SOUP.

Open, and cleanse of the deadman's fingers and sandbag, twelve small
fat crabs raw. Cut the crabs into two parts. Parboil and extract the
meat from the claws, and simply extract the fat from the back shells
of the crabs. Scald eighteen ripe tomatoes, skin them and squeeze the
pulp from the seeds through a colander. Chop them fine and pour
boiling water over the seeds and juice, and strain them. Stew a short
time in the soup-pot one large onion, one clove of garlic, in one
spoonful butter and two spoonfuls lard, and put them in the tomatoes.

After stewing a few minutes, add the meat from the claws, then the
crabs, and lastly the fat from the back shells. Season with salt,
cayenne and black pepper, parsley, sweet marjoram and thyme, one-half
teaspoonful lemon juice, and peel of one lemon. Pour in the water with
which the seeds were scalded, adding more should there not be the
quantity of soup required. Boil moderately one hour. About a quarter
of an hour before serving, sift in grated bread crumbs or pounded
crackers as a thickening. Any firm fish prepared by this recipe is
excellent.--_Mrs. J. I._


_Crab Soup._

One dozen crabs to one gallon water. Take off top shell; clear body of
crabs. Cut through the middle, put them into a kettle, mix with some
butter, and brown them. Then add one gallon water, and simmer for half
an hour. Skim slightly, and add the hock of an old ham, and strained
tomato juice one pint. Boil two hours. Season with pepper, spice if
liked, and half-pint wine.

The claws are to be cracked and divested of the jaws. A Hampton
recipe.--_Miss E. W._


BEEF SOUP.

Crack the bone of a shin of beef, and put it on to boil in one quart
water. To every pound meat add one large teaspoonful salt to each
quart water. Let it boil two hours and skim it well. Then add:

     4 turnips, pared and cut into quarters.
     4 onions, pared and sliced.
     2 carrots, scraped and sliced.
     1 root of celery, cut into small pieces.

When the vegetables are tender, add a little parsley chopped fine,
with salt and pepper to the taste. Serve hot.--_Mrs. P. McG._


_Another Recipe for Beef Soup._

One shin beef in one-half gallon water, put on before breakfast and
boiled until dinner. Thicken with brown flour two or three hours
before dinner. Put in one carrot, two turnips, one onion, thyme,
cabbage, and celery-seed.--_Mrs. H. P. C._


_To prepare a Beef's Head as Stock for Soup._

Cut up the head into small pieces, and boil in a large quantity of
water until it is all boiled to pieces. Take out all the bones as for
souse cheese, and boil again until thick. Then while hot, season very
highly with pepper, salt, catsup, allspice, and onions chopped fine.

Put into a mould to get cold. For a small family cut a thick slice,
say five inches square, whenever you want soup in a hurry, adding
about a quart of water. It need cook for a few minutes only, and is
valuable as keeping well and being ready in times of emergency. By
adding a few slices of hard-boiled egg and a gill of good cooking
wine, this soup may have very nearly the flavor of mock turtle.--_Mrs.
A. M. D._


CALF'S HEAD SOUP.

Take one-half liver and the head of a mutton, veal or beef, and boil
until the meat drops from the bone. Cut up fine and add one-half the
brains; then:

     1 onion.
     1 spoonful spice.
     1/2 spoonful cloves.
     1 spoonful black pepper and a piece of mace.
     3 tablespoonfuls flour.
     3 tablespoonfuls flour, and salt to the taste.

Put in enough water at first, as adding it makes the soup thin.

Cut up three hard boiled eggs, and add, when done, one glass of wine.

A little brandy and walnut catsup, with more eggs, will improve it,
though it is a delightful soup as it is.--_Mrs. W. A. C._


_Calf's Head Soup._

Clean the head, laying aside the brains. Put the head in a gallon of
water, with pepper and salt. Boil to pieces and take out bones; return
to the pot with--

     1 teacup of mushroom or tomato catsup.
     1 teaspoonful allspice.
     1 lemon rind, grated.
     1 grated nutmeg.
     1 tablespoonful butter.
     1 teacup of browned flour.

Fry, and add the brains when nearly ready for the table. About five
minutes before serving, add:

     1 teacup of wine.
     1 teaspoonful cloves.
     1 teaspoonful mace.

When sent to the table have two hard-boiled eggs sliced and floating
on top.--_Mrs. J. D._


_Calf's Head Soup._

Take a large calf's head and boil it with four gallons water and a
little salt; when tender, bone and chop it fine, keeping out the
brains, and put the meat back in the pot and boil down to a tureenful.
Half an hour before serving the soup, add:

     1 tablespoonful mustard.
     1 teaspoonful black pepper.
     1 teaspoonful powdered cloves.
     1 teaspoonful mace.
     1 teaspoonful nutmeg.

Brown a cup of flour to thicken and just as the soup is dished, add
one cup walnut catsup, and one cup port or claret wine.

The brains must be beaten up with an egg, fried in little cakes, and
dropped in the tureen.--_Miss N._


CALF'S HEAD SOUP.

Take the head, split it open and take out the brains; then put the
head, brains, and haslet in salt water--let them soak one hour. Put on
to boil at eight o'clock; after boiling four hours, take it up and
chop up the head and haslet, removing all the bones; return to the
soup, with a small pod of pepper. Thicken it with one pint browned
flour with one tablespoonful butter rubbed in it. Have--

     1 tablespoonful mace.
     1 tablespoonful allspice.
     1/2 doz. cloves.

Beat all together and put in the tureen with,

     1 teacup of tomato catsup.
     1 teacup of cooking wine.

Pour the soup on them. Have the brains fried, and two hard boiled eggs
sliced and dropped in the soup.--_Mrs. T. C._


_Brown Calf's Head Soup._

Scald and clean the head, and put it to boil in two gallons water,
with

     A shank of veal.
     2 carrots.
     3 onions.
     A small piece of bacon.
     A bunch of sweet herbs.

When they have boiled half an hour, take out the head and shank, and
cut all the meat off the bone in pieces two inches square. Let the
soup boil half an hour longer, then strain it and put in the meat, and
season with salt, black and cayenne pepper (and a few cloves, if you
like them). Thicken with butter and brown flour.

Let it now boil nearly an hour longer, and just before serving it,
stir in one tablespoonful sugar browned in a frying-pan, and half a
pint wine. A good substitute for turtle soup.--_Mrs. Col. A. F._


_Calf's Head Soup._

Have a head nicely cleaned, the brains taken out and the head put to
soak. Put it on with,

     1 gallon water.
     1 piece of fat ham.
     Thyme, parsley, pepper and salt.

Boil together until the flesh is tender; take out and chop--strain the
water--two tablespoonfuls brown flour, four ounces butter--returning
the "dismembered" fragments; let it boil till reduced to two quarts.
Season with one-half pint wine, one gill catsup, nutmeg, mace,
allspice.

Cut up the liver, and fry; beat the brains up with an egg, pepper and
salt; fry in cakes and lay in the soup when served up, and hard boiled
eggs sliced up and put in.--_Miss B. L._


_Ox-tail Soup._

Wash and soak three tails; pour on them one gallon cold water; let
them be brought gradually to boil, throw in one and a half ounce salt,
and clear off the scum carefully as soon as it forms on the surface.
When it ceases to rise, add:

     4 moderate sized carrots.
     2 or 3 onions.
     1 large bunch savory herbs.
     1 head celery.
     2 turnips.
     6 or 8 cloves, and 1/2 teaspoonful peppercorns.

Stew these gently from three hours to three and a half hours. If the
tails be very large, lift them out, strain the liquor and strain off
all the fat. Cut the meat from the tails and put it in two quarts or
more of the stock. Stir in, when this begins to boil, a thickening of
arrow-root or of rice flour, mixed with as much cayenne and salt as
may be required to flavor the soup, and serve very hot.--_Mrs. P._


CHICKEN SOUP.

Put on the chickens with about three quarts water and some thin slices
bacon. Let it boil well, then put in:

     A spoonful butter.
     1 pint milk.
     1 egg, well beaten.
     Pepper, salt, and celery or celery-seed or parsley.

Let all boil up. Some dumplings made like biscuits are very nice in
it.--_Mrs. W._


_Roast Veal and Chicken-bone Soup._

Boil the veal and chicken bones with vegetables, and add one handful
maccaroni, broken up fine. Boil the soup half an hour. Color with a
little soy or catsup.--_Mrs. S._


_Chicken Soup._

Put on the fire a pot with two gallons water and a ham bone, if you
have it; if not, some slices of good bacon. Boil this two hours, then
put in the chickens and boil until done: add one-half pint milk and a
little thickening; pepper and salt to the taste. After taking off the
soup, put in a piece of butter size of an egg. Squirrel soup is good
made the same way, but takes much longer for a squirrel to boil
done.--_Mrs. P. W._


GIBLET SOUP.

     1 pint dried green English peas.
     1 pound giblets.
     1 dozen cloves.
     1 small piece red pepper.
     Nearly 1 gallon water.

Boil peas slowly seven hours. Add giblets, spices, and salt to taste,
two hours before dinner. When peas are dissolved, strain through
sieve; cut giblets into dice and return to soup; boil up and serve.
Will be enough for six or eight persons.--_Mrs. R. R._


OKRA SOUP.

     11/2 gallons water.
     2 quarts young okra, cut very fine.
     2 quarts tomatoes.
     Onions, prepared as for pea soup.
     Pepper; salt.
     1 large spoonful butter.

Add the tomatoes about twelve o'clock. Put the soup on early in the
morning.--_Mrs. I._


GUMBO SOUP.

     1 fried chicken.
     1 quart okra, cut up.
     1 onion.
     1 bunch parsley.
     Few celery tops--fry all together. Put in one quart skinned tomatoes.
     11/2 gallons water, boil to 1/2 gallon.
     Teacup of wine after taking from the fire.--_Mrs. R. A._


_Gumbo Soup._

Fry two fowls, old or young, with parsley, pepper, salt, onion, lard
or bacon.

Put it in the pot with water sufficient for the soup. One quart sliced
okra, scrap of ham or fried sausage to boil with it.

Sassafras Gumbo is made in the same way, except after the fowl has
boiled until the flesh has left the bone, just before taking off the
fire, stir in one tablespoonful sassafras flour. Oysters are a great
improvement to sassafras gumbo. Gather the sassafras leaves green, and
dry in the shade, as sage; when thoroughly dry, rub through a sieve
and bottle and cork tightly. It is nice in beef soup instead of
okra.--_Mrs. T._


FINE VEGETABLE SOUP.

Put on two pounds of fresh beef, or a good-sized chicken, or ham bone
if you have it, early in the morning. Put your boiler on filled with
water. Keep boiling, and when boiled down, about one hour or more
before dinner, add:

     Grated lemon peel.
     6 ears corn.
     1 dozen good tomatoes.
     Beans.
     1 small head of cabbage.
     A few Irish potatoes.
     Sweet herbs, pepper and salt to the taste.

A few leaves of dried sassafras rubbed up will improve the taste.
Serve hot with toast, a small quantity of sugar and vinegar. Boil till
thick.--_Mrs. Dr. L._


VEGETABLE SOUP.

Before breakfast, wash a beef shank in several waters, break the bone,
and put it in a large pot of cold water. Keep it steadily boiling
until one hour before dinner, when the following vegetables,
previously prepared, must be added to the soup after it has been
carefully skimmed of all grease, and strained.

     1 quart peeled and chopped tomatoes.
     1 pint lima or butter beans.
     1 pint grated corn.
     1 pint chopped cabbage.
     1 pint sliced Irish potatoes.
     1 sliced turnip.
     1 carrot.
     A little minced onion.
     Parsley.
     1 tablespoonful pepper sauce.
     1 heaping tablespoonful flour rubbed into--
     1 teacup milk.
     1 teacup brown sugar.
     1 teaspoonful black pepper.

Boil an hour: thicken with mixed milk and flour, and serve.

A piece of middling, bacon, or any other kind of meat, may be used
instead of the beef shank. The best meat of the shank may be freed
from gristle, chopped fine and made into a nice stew by adding

     1 grated turnip.
     1 mashed potato.
     1 tablespoonful pepper sauce.
     1 tablespoonful made mustard.
     1 tablespoonful butter.
     1 teaspoonful celery seed.
     1 teaspoonful fruit jelly.
     1 teacup milk.
     Minced onion and parsley.

Boil up and serve.--_Mrs. S. T._


TOMATO SOUP.

Take one quart ripe tomatoes, peeled and chopped up, or a three-pound
can of same, put in an earthenware baking dish with

     1 pint grated corn (or, if in winter, dried corn prepared as if
       for the table), and add--
     1 teacup sugar.
     1 teacup grated cracker.
     1 teacup butter.
     1 teaspoonful black pepper.
     2 teaspoonfuls salt.

Set this in a hot oven with a tin plate over it to prevent browning.
Have ready, in a porcelain kettle or pan, two quarts new milk boiling
hot. When the tomatoes and corn are thoroughly done, stir in one large
Irish potato mashed smooth, a little minced onion and parsley, and
pour into the boiling milk and serve.--_Mrs. S. T._


_Tomato Soup._

A shin of beef, season to your taste with all kinds of vegetables:

Tomatoes, turnips, carrots, potatoes, cabbage cut fine, corn, butter
beans and celery.

When nearly done, take vegetables out and mash them well, and also cut
the beef up fine. It is best to season with salt and pepper when you
first put it on. The beef should be put on very early.--_Mrs. J. L._


_Clear Tomato Soup._

     1 large can tomatoes.
     1 beef shin.
     1 bunch soup herbs.
     1 gallon water.

Boil eight hours, stir and skim several times. Strain through wire
sieve, add one tablespoonful Worcester sauce and same of brown sugar.
Serve with dice of toasted bread; pepper and salt to taste.--_Mrs. R.
R._


ASPARAGUS SOUP.

Cut the asparagus into small pieces and put on to boil in salt water,
with slices of middling; just before dinner, taking it off, beat four
eggs and stir in one pint milk or cream, a piece of butter. A piece of
veal may be boiled with it, if you wish meat.--_Mrs. H._


_Asparagus Soup._

Parboil the asparagus with as much water as will cover them; then pour
the water and asparagus into milk, then add butter, pepper and salt,
also bread crumbs, and boil until the asparagus is done.--_Mrs. S._


PEA SOUP.

Soak one pint of split peas in water for twelve hours; drain off the
water, put the peas into a saucepan with three pints cold water,
one-half pound bacon, two sprigs of dried mint, a bay leaf, some
parsley, an onion stuck with one or two cloves, some whole pepper, and
salt to taste.

Let the whole boil three hours, then pass the puree through a hair
sieve; make it hot again and serve with dice of bread fried in
butter.--_Mrs. A._


GREEN PEA SOUP.

Boil one quart peas in two quarts water, and two thin slices bacon.
When done mash through a colander; then put back in the same water,
throwing away the slices of bacon. Season with pepper, salt, spoonful
butter rolled in flour.

Boil well again. Toast some bread and cut in slices, and put in the
tureen when the soup is served. The hulls of green peas will answer;
boil them well with a few peas, then season as above and boil. Two
hours will be enough to boil green pea soup.--_Mrs. W._


_Green Pea Soup._

Boil half a peck of peas in one and a half gallons water, till
perfectly done. Take out, mash and strain through a colander, then
pour a little of the water well boiled over them, to separate the pulp
from the hull. Return it to the water they were boiled in; chop up one
large or two small onions; fry them in smallest quantity of lard, not
to brown them. Add this with chopped thyme, parsley, pepper and salt.

Just before taking off the fire stir in one tablespoonful butter. If
the soup is too thin, cream a little butter with flour to
thicken.--_Mrs. I._


POTATO SOUP.

Mash potatoes, pour on them one teacup cream, one large spoonful
butter.

Pour boiling water on them till you have the desired quantity. Boil
until it thickens; season with salt, parsley, and pepper to your
taste.--_Mrs. R. E._


_Potato Soup._

Pour two quarts water on six or seven large peeled potatoes, adding
two or three slices of middling; boil thoroughly done. Take them out,
mash the potatoes well and return all to the same water, together
with pepper, salt, one spoonful butter, and one quart milk, as for
chicken soup.--_Mrs. W._




OYSTERS AND OTHER SHELL FISH.


STEWED OYSTERS.

Put butter, salt and pepper in a stew-pan, and put the oysters to the
butter and stew until perfectly done.--_Mrs. D._


_Stewed Oysters._

Take one-quarter pound nice butter, put it in a pan and melt, then
pepper and salt, add a small piece of cheese. When it is all melted
add one pint of oyster liquor, and boil; when hot, strain and put back
in pan, then add oysters and boil five minutes.--_Mr. K. N._


_Stewed Oysters._

     Pour into a stew-pan 1/2 gallon oysters.
     2 tablespoonfuls pepper vinegar.
     1 teaspoonful black pepper.
     1 teaspoonful salt.

Let them simmer until the oysters are plump; take them out with a fork
and drop them into a tureen, on a handful of crackers and three
heaping tablespoonfuls fresh butter.

Pour one pint milk to the liquor, let it boil up and strain it on the
oysters. Rinse out the stew-pan and pour the oysters, liquor, etc.,
back into it, and set it on the fire. When it comes to a boil, serve.

This method deprives the oysters of the bits of shell.--_Mrs S. T._


_To Stew Oysters._

Put into the kettle one pint liquor, one-half pound butter, and
pepper.

Let it boil, then put in the oysters, after draining them in a
colander. They will be done as soon as they boil up, or when they curl
right well. When ready to take up, add half teacup cracker crumbs and
a little salt in the stew.--_Mrs. P. W._


_To Stew Oysters._

Put into a shallow stew-pan the oysters. As soon as the gills begin to
open pour off all the liquor. Continue to cook them, stirring all the
time until done. The liquor that was poured off must be thickened with
a good lump of butter rubbed up with flour, and seasoned with pepper
and salt, and poured boiling-hot onto the oysters.

The advantage of this way of cooking is that the oysters become large
and plump.--_Mrs. Dr. E. R._


_To Cook Oysters._

     1/2 gallon oysters.
     1 quart fresh milk.
     1/2 pound butter.
     1 tablespoonful flour.
     1 teaspoonful salt.
     1 teaspoonful pepper.
     1 egg.

Rub the egg and flour together and thin with a little of the milk. Mix
the oysters, pepper and salt, and let them come to a boil; then add
the milk, and when this boils add the egg and flour with the butter.
Let the whole boil three minutes.--_Miss N. S. L._


SCALLOPED OYSTERS.

Do not drain the liquor from the oysters, but fork them out of it as
you use them; in that way as much liquor as you require adheres to
them. Use stale bread, and do not crumb it too fine, or it will be
clammy.

     1/2 teacupful cream.
     2 great spoonfuls butter.
     Salt and pepper.

Oysters part with a great deal of moisture in cooking, and if the
mixture is too wet it is not as good; it should be rather dry when
done. Cover the bottom of a well-buttered dish with a layer of very
dry bread crumbs, dust over a little salt and pepper, and stick little
bits of butter all over the crumbs; then, with a spoon, moisten it
with cream. Next, place a layer of oysters, alternating with bread
crumbs, until the dish is filled, finishing with butter and cream;
invert a plate over it to keep in the flavor. Bake three-quarters of
an hour, or until the juice bubbles to the top. Remove the plate, and
brown on the upper shelf of the oven for two or three minutes
only.--_Mrs. R._


_Scalloped Oysters._

Those who are fond of oysters prepared in this way will find them much
more delicate when cooked entirely by reflected heat. Have your tinner
make you an old-fashioned "tin-kitchen" with _sloping_ sides. Take
small oblong dishes, such as are in general use at hotels, fill them
with alternate layers of oysters and rolled crackers, and lay lumps of
fresh butter liberally on top of each dish. Arrange them in the
"kitchen," set the open dish in front of a bright fire or very warm
grate, and in fifteen or twenty minutes you will find the oysters
delicious.--_Mrs. D. P._


_Scalloped Oysters._

Put on the oysters with just enough liquor to keep from burning, and
parboil slightly. Season the rest of the liquor as for stewed oysters
with butter, pepper, salt, and a little flour, and boil until done.
Put the parboiled oysters in a baking-dish, with a piece of butter
and a grated cracker or stale bread and pepper, and pour as much of
the gravy as the dish will hold. Put a little of the grated cracker on
top, and set it in the oven to brown.--_Mrs. W._


_Oysters Scalloped in the Shell._

Open the shells, setting aside for use the deepest ones. Have ready
some melted butter, not hot, seasoned with minced parsley and pepper.

Roll each oyster in this, letting it drip as little as may be, and lay
in the shell, which should be arranged in a baking-pan.

Add to each a little lemon juice, sift bread crumbs over it, and bake
in a quick oven till done. Serve in the shells.--_Mrs. S._


_Scalloped Oysters._

Put in the scallop shells as many oysters as each will hold. Season
with butter, salt and pepper; a few bread crumbs.

Cook until well done; add a piece of butter just before they are
served.--_Mrs. R. L. O._


DEVILLED OYSTERS.

Put a layer of raw oysters in a pan, and then a layer of breadcrumbs,
black and red pepper, salt, butter, mustard, and a little vinegar
mixed together.

Put alternate layers of each until full, and then bake.--_Mrs. Duke._


_Devilled Oysters._

Drain one quart oysters; chop thoroughly and season with cayenne
pepper, lemon-juice, salt, and yolks of two hard-boiled eggs, and
yolks of two raw eggs beaten and stirred in; one-half as much bread
crumbs as you have oysters, and one large tablespoonful butter.

Have ready one dozen deep shells, nicely cleaned, and fill them with
the oysters; sprinkle with bread crumbs, and bake in a few
minutes.--_Mrs. H. S._


_To Cook Oysters._

Put into a baking-bowl a layer of cracker-crumbs, pepper, and butter.
If the butter is salty do not use any salt. Then a layer of oysters,
after they have been drained from their liquor; do this alternately
till the dish is full. Be sure and put the cracker crumbs at the top
of the dish, and bits of butter, also pepper: this makes it brown
nicely. Set it in a hot oven; as soon as browned it will be ready for
the table.--_Mrs. P. W._


FRIED OYSTERS.

Take each oyster separately and put salt and pepper on them; then roll
them in equal portions of meal and flour. Fry them in hot lard until a
light brown.--_Mrs. D._


OYSTER FRITTERS.

Beat two eggs very light; then stir in two tablespoonfuls cream or
milk, three tablespoonfuls sifted flour, a pinch of salt; dip the
oysters in this and fry them in hot lard.--_Mrs. B._


_Oyster Fritters._

Wipe the oysters dry. Beat 6 eggs light, and stir into them:

     6 tablespoonfuls flour.
     11/2 pint rich milk.

Beat to smooth batter. Have in a pan some butter and lard; when it
begins to froth, put a small ladleful of the batter, with an oyster in
the middle, into it to fry. If too thin, add flour; if too thick,
milk.--_Mrs. R._


TO FRY OYSTERS.

Drain the oysters through a sieve; sprinkle a little salt and pepper
over them. Dip each oyster into meal. Have the pan hot, and drop in an
equal portion of lard and butter; when boiling, put in the oysters and
fry. Do not let them stand, but serve hot.--_Mrs. E._


FRIED OYSTERS.

Drain the oysters through a sieve. Beat up two or three eggs. Have
ready some grated bread crumbs. Sprinkle some salt and a little pepper
over the oysters; then dip each oyster into the egg and bread crumbs.
Have the pan hot and clean; put equal portions of butter and lard into
the pan. Be careful to keep the fat of oysters from burning.--_Mrs.
R._


_To Fry Oysters._

Wash them and dry them on a clean napkin; dip in beaten egg and
pounded crackers sifted, and let them lie several hours before frying,
and they will not shrink.--_Mrs. P._


_To Fry Oysters._

oyster first in the egg and then in the crackers; do this twice.
Grease the pan with butter or lard. Add pepper and salt to taste, and
fry.--_Mrs. P. W._


_Clam or Oyster Fritters._

Chop up the clam very fine (when of oysters, leave them whole); put
them in a batter and fry them.--_Mrs. D._


BROILED OYSTERS.

Select the largest oysters, examining each one, to see that no
particle of shell adheres to it. Dry with a nice linen cloth; then
pepper and salt them, and sift over a little finely-powdered cracker.
Place them on an oyster gridiron over a quick fire. As soon as plump,
dip each one in a cup of melted fresh butter; lay on a hot dish
garnished with scraped horseradish and parsley, and serve.--_Mrs. S.
T._


STEAMED OYSTERS.

Wash shell oysters perfectly clean; lay them on a steamer, so the
juice will not escape from the shells when opened. It is best to lay
the upper shells down. Cover the lid of the steamer with a coarse
towel and press closely on. Set this over a pot of water boiling hard.
In from twenty minutes to half an hour, the shells will have opened.
Have ready a hot dish, on which lay the oysters; sprinkle over them a
little salt and pepper with a bit of fresh butter on each oyster.
Serve immediately.--_Mrs. S. T._


TO ROAST OYSTERS.

Wash and wipe one peck large shell oysters. Put in a hot oven, taking
care to put the upper shell downward, so the juice will not escape. As
soon as the shells open, lay on a hot dish and serve with horseradish
or pepper-sauce, after sprinkling on them a little salt, and putting a
bit of fresh butter on each oyster.--_Mrs. S. T._


PICKLED OYSTERS.

     6 blades mace.
     1 small piece cayenne pepper.

Pick oysters out from the juice with a fork; stew until gills are
opened well, then lay on flat dishes until cold; put in a jar, and
cover with equal parts of stewed juice and vinegar. Let stand two
days.--_Mrs. R. R._


_Pickled Oysters._

Take two hundred oysters of largest size, rinse them in their own
liquor and put them in a stew-pan. Strain the liquor to them, let them
come to a boil, and _no more_. Take them out of the liquor; have ready
one quart or more of pure cider vinegar, with which boil whole pepper,
a little salt, mace, cloves, and nutmeg.

When it is cool, pour over the oysters. Before serving add a few raw
cranberries and thin slices of lemon.--_Mrs. S. T._


_Pickled Oysters._

Take one gallon oysters and cook them in their own liquor till nearly
done. Then skim out the oysters and add to the liquor one teaspoonful
whole black pepper, one teaspoonful allspice, one teaspoonful mace, a
little red pepper and half a pint of strong vinegar.

Let it boil a few minutes and then pour over the oysters. When nearly
cool, slice in them a large fresh lemon.--_Mrs. Col. A. F._


OYSTER PIE.

Stew the oysters, not entirely done, with butter, pepper and one
tablespoonful pepper-sauce, and salt. Make a paste of one pound flour
and one-half pound butter. Line the dish and put in the oysters, grate
bread crumbs over top, and bake.--_Mrs. T._


_Oyster Pie._

Put a paste in a deep dish. Wash the oysters, drain and put them in
the dish, seasoning with butter, pepper, salt, and a little mace, if
liked; then put in a layer of grated cracker. When the dish is full,
cover with paste and slips of paste laid across; then bake.--_Mrs.
W----._


OYSTER PATES.

Stew some large oysters with a little nutmeg, a few cloves, some yolk
of egg boiled hard and grated, a little butter and as much liquor from
the oysters as will cover them. When stewed a few minutes, take them
out of the pan to cool. Have shells of puff paste, previously baked in
patty pans, and lay two or three oysters in each.--_Mrs. D._


OYSTER SHORT CAKE.

     1 quart flour.
     3 teaspoonfuls baking powder.
     1 tablespoonful butter.
     A pinch of salt.
     Enough sweet milk to moisten well.

Roll about one inch thick and bake on tin pie plates quickly. While it
is baking, take one quart oysters and one-half cup water and put on
the stove; then take one-half cup milk, and one-half cup butter mixed
with one tablespoonful flour, and a little salt or pepper; add all
together and boil up once.

When the cakes are done, split them open and spread the oysters
between them, and some on the top. Put the oysters that are left in a
gravy-dish and replenish when needed.--_Mrs. K._


OYSTER SAUSAGE.

RAW OYSTERS.

Take each oyster separately on a fork and drain from the liquor. Place
on the table in an oyster tureen or salad bowl; have near a pile of
small oblong dishes; scraped horseradish, pepper sauce, and
Worcestershire sauce, etc., so that after being helped, each guest may
season to taste.

When oysters are transported some distance, it is well to boil the
liquor from which they have been taken and pour over them: this makes
them plump and prevents them from being slimy.--_Mrs. S. T._


TO KEEP OYSTERS ALIVE AND FATTEN.

Mix one pint of salt with thirty pints of water. Put the oysters in a
tub that will not leak, with their mouths upwards and feed them with
the above, by dipping in a broom and frequently passing over their
mouths. It is said that they will fatten still more by mixing fine
meal with the water.--_Mrs. R----._


TO COOK CRABS.

Take live crabs and put them in cool water, let them remain for half
an hour. Then put them in a vessel, pour boiling water on them
sufficient to cover them; boil ten minutes. Take them off and wipe
them clean, first removing the dead men, and proceed to remove the
meat. Take the upper shell, clean it. Season the meat with pepper,
salt, mustard, and plenty of butter; put all in the shell again and
bake half an hour.--_Mrs. K. Norfolk._

     3 tablespoonfuls of stale bread crumbs.
     1/2 wine glass of cream.
     Yolks of 3 eggs.
     A little chopped parsley.
     1 tablespoonful butter.
     Salt and pepper to the taste.

Put them in the shell and bake in a quick oven.--_Mrs. M. E. L. W._


SOFT CRABS.

Turn up the ends of the shells and take out the dead man's fingers and
take off the flap, and cut out the sand-bag; lay them in cold water
until ready to fry. Then dust flour over them, a little salt, and fry
them in hot lard.--_Mrs. D._


DEVILLED CRABS.

After the crabs are boiled, pick them up fine and add one third the
quantity of crab, in cracker dust or bread crumbs, mustard, red and
black pepper, salt, and butter. Return them to the top shells, and
bake.--_Mrs. D._

First cut up the head and put it in the pot to boil with the shell on;
when done enough to remove the under shell, take it up and pick to
pieces. Clean the top shell well; add a few crackers, onions, parsley,
allspice, black pepper, butter, and wine.

Return it to the shell, put sliced lemon on and bake it.--_Mrs. D._

Smother the steaks in an egg-batter. Season with pepper, salt, butter,
and with a little bread crumbs; fry or broil.


TO COOK TURTLES.

Drop four turtles into boiling water, and boil one hour; then take
them out and remove the skin from the legs and feet, and replace them
in fresh boiling water, where they should continue to boil one and
one-half hour and then be taken out to cool. When cold, clean them
thoroughly, removing the round liver which contains the gall. Cut them
into small bits and place them in a stewpan, adding pepper, salt, the
eggs that are found within, one quart water, one-half pound butter,
and two tablespoonfuls flour mixed with a little cold water. Stir the
flour and water well into the other ingredients, and stew about twenty
minutes. As you remove them from the fire, pour in one-half pint
Madeira wine.--_Mrs. A. D._




FISH.


In selecting fish, notice if the flesh is firm and hard, the eyes full
and prominent, the scales bright, the fins stiff, and the gills red,
as all these indications denote their being fresh. Wash the fish, rub
it with salt and pepper, and lay it on a dish, or hang it up till
ready to cook. Never keep it lying in water, either in preparing it
for cooking, or in trying to keep it till the next day.

In boiling fish, put it in boiling water, and simmer very slowly. It
will require an hour to boil a large fish, and about twenty minutes
for a small one. Every housekeeper should have a fish-kettle for fish.

Be careful to have boiling-hot lard in the frying-pan when you go to
fry fish. First rub salt and pepper and flour or meal on the fish,
then keep it well covered while frying, as you should do to every
thing that is being fried. Doing this will enable you to fry the fish
(or other article of food) a pretty amber color, while at the same
time it will be perfectly done.

Always have a tin sheet for lifting boiled fish and for turning
broiled fish. Before broiling, rub with pepper and salt, and then
grease with fresh butter. Lay the fish on a gridiron well greased with
sweet lard and lay the tin sheet over it. When you wish to turn, take
the gridiron from the fire, holding the tin sheet on top the fish.
Hold them together, then lay them on a table with the tin sheet down
and the gridiron uppermost. Carefully raise the gridiron, leaving the
fish lying unbroken on the tin sheet. The cook may now easily slide
the fish on the gridiron, put it again on the fire and brown the other
side, putting the tin sheet back on top of it. Every thing should be
covered while being broiled. When done, lay it on a dish and pour over
it melted butter in which has been stirred pepper, salt, and minced
parsley. If devilled fish is desired, add to this dressing, one
tablespoonful pepper vinegar, one of celery vinegar, one of walnut
catsup, one of made mustard, one wine-glassful of acid fruit jelly. In
making sauces for fish, never use the water in which the fish has been
boiled.

Full directions for stewing fish are to be found in the subsequent
pages.


FISH A LA CREME.

Boil a firm fish, remove the bones, pick it to pieces. Mix one pint
cream or milk with two tablespoonfuls flour, one onion, one-half pound
butter (or less), and salt.

Set it on the fire and stir until it is as thick as custard. Fill a
baking-dish alternately with fish, cracker, and cream. Bake for thirty
minutes, use four crackers.--_Mrs. W. C. R._

When washed and dried, sprinkle over pepper and salt. Have ready in a
baking-pan a small grating; lay the fish on this, with bits of butter
over it; set in a hot oven, basting often and freely with butter. When
nicely browned, butter a sheet of white paper and lay over it, to
prevent its getting too dry; when done and tender, place on a hot
dish. Add to the gravy one teacupful milk, one tablespoonful pepper
vinegar, pepper, salt, and a mashed Irish potato smoothly mixed in;
boil, and pour over the fish. Sift over all browned cracker. Garnish
with bleached tops of celery and curled parsley alternately.--_Mrs.
T._


BOILED SALMON.

After the fish has been cleaned and washed, dry it and sew it up in a
cloth; lay it in a fish-kettle, cover with warm water, and simmer
until done and tender. Meanwhile have ready in a saucepan one pint
cream, two tablespoonfuls fresh butter, salt, pepper, minced parsley,
and thyme; let it boil up once, not too quickly. Take the fish from
the kettle, carefully unwrap it, lay it for a moment on a folded
napkin to dry. Have ready a hot dish, lay the fish on it carefully,
without breaking it, pour over the cream. Slice some hard-boiled eggs,
and lay over the fish alternately with sliced lemon. Border the edges
of the dish with curled parsley.--_Mrs. S. T._


SALMON STEAK.

When well dried, pepper and salt, sift over powdered cracker, and lay
upon a gridiron, which has been first greased with butter or lard,
over hot coals. As soon as the side next to the fire is brown, turn it
by carefully slipping under it a batter-cake turner and holding the
fish on it with the other hand, lest it should break. When both sides
are of a light brown, lay in a hot dish; pepper and salt again; pour
over melted butter; place the cover on, and serve.--_Mrs. T._


PICKLED SALMON.

Soak the salmon twenty-four hours, changing the water. Put it in
boiling water, with a little vinegar. When done and cold, boil your
vinegar with spice and pour on the fish.--_Mrs. A. P._


GERMAN FISH STEW.

Put the fish in a kettle to boil. Stew together in a saucepan one
onion chopped fine and a wine-glass of sweet oil; when well done, pour
them in with the fish. Then mix yolks of three eggs, juice of two
lemons strained, one tablespoonful sifted flour. Beat these well
together, and pour upon the fish when nearly done. Then add ginger,
pepper, and salt to taste; stew three or four minutes, after mixing
all the ingredients. Oysters may be cooked by the same receipt, only
substituting one quart oysters for the fish.--_Mrs. A. D._

Rub the venison over with pepper, salt, and butter. Repeat the
rubbing. After it has been put in the oven, put in as much cold water
as will prevent burning and draw the gravy. Stick five or six cloves
in different parts of the venison. Add enough water to make sufficient
gravy. Just before dinner, put in a glass of red wine and a lump of
butter rolled in flour, and let it stew a little longer.--_Mrs. T._


VENISON HAUNCH.

Prepare the venison as you would mutton.

Put in a baking-pan, lard with a little bacon, add a pint of water, a
gill of red wine, salt, and a little cayenne pepper. Bake quickly, and
serve with or without gravy.


STEWED VENISON.

Cut in tolerably thick slices. Put in an oven with two spoonfuls of
water and a piece of lard. Cook till nearly done, then pour off the
gravy and baste it well with a large spoonful of butter, pepper, and
salt.


_Stewed Venison._

Slice cold venison in a chafing dish and add--

     A cup of water.
     A small teacup of red wine.
     A small teacup of currant jelly.
     A tablespoonful of butter.
     A teaspoonful of made mustard.
     A little yellow pickle.
     A little chopped celery.
     A little mushroom catsup.
     Salt and cayenne pepper to the taste.

The same receipt will answer for cold mutton.--_Mrs. R. L. O._


TO BARBECUE SQUIRREL.

Put some slices of fat bacon in an oven. Lay the squirrels on them and
lay two slices of bacon on the top. Put them in the oven and let them
cook until done. Lay them on a dish and set near the fire. Take out
the bacon, sprinkle one spoonful of flour in the gravy and let it
brown. Then pour in one teacup of water, one tablespoonful of butter,
and some tomato or walnut catsup. Let it cool, and then pour it over
the squirrel.


ROAST RABBIT.

Stew the rabbit. After boiling the haslet and liver, stew them with
parsley, thyme, celery-seed, butter, salt, and pepper, for gravy. Soak
a piece of loaf bread, a short time, in water. Mix with it the yolk of
an egg and some butter, for stuffing; then soak it in milk and cream.
Sprinkle the inside of the rabbit with salt and pepper, fill it with
the above dressing, sew it up, and roast or bake quickly.--_Mrs. B._


BARBECUED RABBIT.

Lay the rabbit in salt and water half an hour, scald with boiling
water, wipe dry, grease with butter, and sprinkle with pepper and a
little salt. Lay it on the gridiron, turning often so that it may cook
through and through, without becoming hard and dry. When brown, lay on
a hot dish, butter plentifully on both sides, and add a little salt
and pepper. Set in the oven, while preparing four teaspoonfuls of
vinegar, one of made mustard, and one of currant jelly or brown sugar.
Pour this over the rabbit, rubbing it in, then pour over the gravy and
serve hot.--_Mrs. T._


STEWED RABBIT.

Cut up the rabbit and wash it. Put it in a stewpan and season it with
salt and pepper. Pour in half a pint of water, and when this has
nearly stewed away, add half a pint of Port wine, two or three blades
of mace, and a tablespoonful of flour, mixed with a quarter of a pound
of butter. Let it stew gently till quite tender, and then serve
hot.--_Mrs. C. C._


_Stewed Rabbit._

Cut a rabbit into eight pieces. After soaking in salt and water, put
it in a stewpan, with a slice of pork or bacon, and with more than
enough water to cover it. When nearly done, take out the pieces,
strain the water in which they have boiled, and return all to the
stewpan, with a teacup of milk, a little pepper, salt, chopped onion
and parsley. After this boils up, stir in a heaping tablespoonful of
butter, in which a tablespoonful of flour has been rubbed. Let it boil
up once more; then serve in a covered dish, with four hard-boiled eggs
sliced over it, and grated bread crumbs. The same receipt will answer
for squirrel.--_Mrs. T._


WILD TURKEY.

If the turkey is old, after it is dressed wash it inside thoroughly
with soda and water. Rinse it and plunge it into a pot of boiling
water for five minutes. Make a stuffing of bits of pork, beef, or any
other cold meat, plenty of chopped celery, stewed giblets, hard-boiled
eggs, pounded cracker, pepper, and salt, and a heaping spoonful of
butter. Work this well and fill the turkey. With another large
spoonful of butter grease the bird, and then sprinkle salt and pepper
over it. Lay in a pan, with a pint of stock or broth in which any kind
of meat has been boiled. Place in a hot oven. When it begins to brown,
dredge with flour and baste, turning often, so that each part may be
equally browned. Put a buttered sheet of paper over the breast, to
prevent dryness. When thoroughly done, lay on a dish, brown some
crackers, pound and sift over it, and serve with celery or oyster
sauce.--_Mrs. T._


_A Simpler Way to Prepare Wild Turkey._

Prepare the turkey as usual, rub the inside with salt and cayenne
pepper, and put in the baking-pan, with water enough to make gravy.
Cut up the gizzard and liver with a lump of butter and a spoonful of
cream. Mix with the gravy and serve hot.


_To Roast Wild Fowl in a Stove._

Put them on a rack above a pan, so that the gravy will drip through.
This makes them as delicate as if roasted on a spit. If roasted in a
pan, they will be exceedingly greasy and have the _stovey_ taste to
which so many persons object.--_Mrs. J. W. S._


WILD GOOSE.

After the goose is dressed, soak it several hours in salt and water.
Put a small onion inside and plunge it into boiling water for twenty
minutes. Stuff with chopped celery, chopped eggs, mashed potatoes,
bits of fat pork or other cold meat; a little butter; raw turnip
grated; a tablespoonful of pepper vinegar; a little chopped onion;
pepper and salt to the taste.

A teacup of stock or broth must be put in the pan with the fowl.
Butter it, dredge with flour, and baste often. Pin a buttered paper
over the breast to prevent its becoming hard. Serve with mushroom or
celery sauce, or, for a simpler taste, serve merely with its own
gravy.--_Mrs. T._


_Wild Goose._

Put a small onion inside, a slice of pork, pepper, salt, and a
spoonful of red wine.

Lay in a pan with water enough to make gravy. Dredge with flour, and
baste with butter frequently. Cook quickly and serve with gravy made
as for wild turkey.


WILD DUCK.

When the duck is ready dressed, put in it a small onion, pepper, salt,
and a spoonful of red wine. Lay in a pan with water enough to make the
gravy. Cook in fifteen or twenty minutes, if the fire is brisk. Serve
with gravy made as for wild turkey.

Canvas-back ducks are cooked in the same way, only you leave on their
heads and do not use onion with them.--_Mrs. R. L. O._


_To Cook Wild Duck for Breakfast._

Split open in the back, put in a pan with a little water, butter,
pepper and salt, and cook till tender. Baste with flour. If for
dinner, cook whole.--_Mrs. J. L. C._


TO BROIL PARTRIDGES.

Place them in salt and water, an hour or two before broiling. When
taken out, wipe them dry, and rub them all over with fresh butter,
pepper and salt. First broil the under or split side on the gridiron,
over bright, clear coals, turning until the upper side is of a fine,
light brown. It must be cooked principally from the under side. When
done, rub well again with fresh butter and if not ready to serve them
immediately, put them in a large shallow tin bucket, cover it and set
it over a pot or kettle of boiling water, which will keep them hot
without making them hard or dry and will give time for the many "last
things" to be done before serving a meal. When served, sift over them
powdered cracker, first browned.--_Mrs. T._


TO ROAST PARTRIDGES.

Clean the birds as for stuffing. Rub with butter, salt and pepper. Put
in sheets of letter paper and allow to cook in this way.--_Mrs. W. C._


TO COOK PARTRIDGES AND PHEASANTS.

Place them in a steamer, over a pot of boiling water, till tender.

Have ready a saucepan of large fresh oysters, scalded just enough to
make them plump and seasoned with pepper-sauce, butter, and a little
salt. Rub the cavity of the birds with salt and pepper, fill with
oysters and sew up. Broil till a light brown. Place on a hot dish and
sift over them browned cracker. Add a large tablespoonful of butter
and one of pounded cracker to the oyster liquor. Boil it up once and
pour into the dish, but not over the birds.--_Mrs. T._


TO BROIL PIGEONS.

Pigeons may be broiled the same as chickens, only cover the breast
with slices of bacon. When nearly done, remove the bacon, dredge with
flour and baste with butter. They will be done in half an hour.


STEWED PIGEONS.

The pigeons must be seasoned with pepper, salt, cloves, mace and sweet
herbs. Wrap the seasoning up in a piece of butter and put it in the
pigeon. Then tie up the neck and vest and half roast the pigeons. Then
put them in a stewpan with a quart of good gravy, a little white wine,
some pickled mushrooms, a few peppercorns, three or four blades of
mace, a bit of lemon peel, a bit of onion and a bunch of sweet herbs.
Stew until done, then thicken with butter and yolks of eggs. Garnish
with lemon.


PIGEON PIE.

Take six young pigeons. After they are drawn, trussed, and singed,
stuff them with the chopped livers mixed with parsley, salt, pepper,
and a small piece of butter. Cover the bottom of the dish with rather
small pieces of beef. On the beef, place a thin layer of chopped
parsley and mushrooms, seasoned with pepper and salt. Over this place
the pigeons, between each putting the yolk of a hard-boiled egg. Add
some brown sauce or gravy. Cover with puff paste and bake the pie for
an hour and a half.--_Mrs. C. C._


TO DRESS REED BIRDS.

Pick open and carefully wash one dozen or more birds. Place them
between the folds of a towel, and with a rolling-pin mash the bones
quite flat. Season with salt and a little cayenne and black pepper.
Either fry or broil on a gridiron made for broiling oysters. This must
be done over a clear fire. When done, season, put a lump of butter on
each bird and serve hot.--_Mrs. A. M. D._


TO COOK SORA, ORTOLANS, AND OTHER SMALL BIRDS.

Prepare as you would a chicken for roasting. Lay in a pan and pour
boiling water over them or, if convenient, steam them. Scald a few
large fresh oysters till just plump, season them with cayenne pepper,
salt and butter. Pour into the cavity of each bird a few drops of
pepper-sauce and then put a large oyster in each. Broil a short time,
frequently turning that they may not become dry. If not ready to serve
them as soon as they are done, lay in a tin bucket, butter them and
sprinkle them again with black pepper, cover the bucket and set it
over boiling water till wanted. When laid in the dish, sift browned
cracker over the birds, and pour gravy into the dish.--_Mrs. T._


_To Cook Sora, Ortolans, and Other Small Birds._

After they are split open in the back and dressed, lay them in weak
salt and water for a short time. Then lay them on a board and roll
with a rolling-pin to flatten the breastbone. Put butter, pepper, and
salt on them. Lay them on a gridiron and broil slowly. When just done,
add more butter and pepper, lay in a flat tin bucket, which set over a
vessel of boiling water to keep the birds hot, juicy, and tender till
wanted.--_Mrs. T._


SORA, ORTOLANS, ROBINS, AND OTHER SMALL BIRDS.

They should be carefully cleaned, buttered, sprinkled with pepper and
salt, and broiled. When they are served, butter them again. If you
like, serve each bird on a piece of toast, and pour over them a sauce
of red wine, mushroom catsup, salt, cayenne pepper, and celery.




MEATS.


All meats are better in winter for being kept several weeks, and it is
well, in summer, to keep them as long as you can without danger of
their being tainted. If it is not in your power to keep meat in an
ice-house, in summer, keep it in a cool dark cellar, wrapped around
with wet cloths, on top of which lay boughs of elderberry. The
evaporation from the cloth will keep the meat cool and the elderberry
will keep off insects.

If you should unfortunately be obliged to use stale meat or poultry,
rub it in and out with soda, before washing it. Tough meats and
poultry are rendered more tender by putting a little vinegar or a few
slices of lemon in the water in which they are boiled. The use of an
acid will save time and fuel in cooking them and will render them more
tender and digestible.

If possible, keep the meat so clean that it will not be necessary to
wash it, as water extracts the juices. When it is frozen, lay it in
cold water to thaw, and then cook quickly, to prevent its losing its
moisture and sweetness.

In roasting or boiling, use but little salt at first, as it hardens
meat to do otherwise. In roasting, baste frequently, to prevent the
meat from hardening on the outside, and try to preserve the juices. If
possible, roast the meat on a spit before a large, open fire, after
using salt, pepper, butter or lard, and dredging with flour. Where an
open fire-place cannot be obtained, however, the meat may be well
roasted in a stove or range. Mutton, pork, shote and veal should be
well done, but beef should be cooked rare.

In boiling, put on salt meat in cold water, but fresh meat in hot.
Remember also that salt meat requires more water and a longer time to
cook than fresh. Boil slowly, removing the scum that rises when it
begins to simmer. Keep a tea-kettle of boiling water at hand to
replenish the water in the pot, as it boils away. Do not let the meat
boil too hard or too long, as this will toughen it and extract the
juices. Add salt to fresh meat, just before it is done.

Lardering beef, veal, and poultry is a great improvement, keeping it
moist whilst cooking and adding richness to the flavor. Lardering
consists in introducing slips of clear fat bacon or salt pork, into
the surface of meat, by means of a pin, sharp at one end and cleft
into four divisions at the other. This pin may be obtained at any
hardware store.

As the housekeeper is sometimes hurried in preparing a dish, it will
save time and trouble for her to keep on hand a bottle of
meat-flavoring compounded of the following ingredients.

     2 chopped onions.
     3 pods of red pepper (chopped).
     2 tablespoonfuls brown sugar.
     1 tablespoonful celery seed.
     1 tablespoonful ground mustard.
     1 teaspoonful turmeric.
     1 teaspoonful black pepper.
     1 teaspoonful salt.

Put all in a quart bottle and fill it up with cider vinegar. A
tablespoonful of this mixed in a stew, steak, or gravy, will impart
not only a fine flavor, but a rich color. Keeping this mixture on hand
will obviate the necessity of the housekeeper looking through various
spice boxes and packages to get together the requisite ingredients for
flavoring, and will thus save her time and trouble.


HOW TO SELECT MEATS.

Good and wholesome meat should be neither of a pale rosy or pink
color, nor of a deep purple. The first denotes the diseased condition,
the last proves the animal has died a natural death. Good meat has
more of a marble look, in consequence of the branching of the veins
which surround the adipose cells. The fat, especially of the inner
organs, is always firm and suety and never moist, while in general the
fat from diseased cattle is flabby and watery and more often resembles
jelly or boiled parchment. Wholesome meat will always show itself firm
and elastic to the touch, and exhibit no dampness, while bad meat will
appear soft and moist, in fact, often more wet, so that the liquid
substance runs out of the blood when pressed hard. Good meat has very
little smell and diffuses a certain medicinal odor. This can be
distinctly proved by cutting the meat through with a knife and
smelling the blade or pouring water over it. Lastly, bad meat has the
peculiarity that it shrinks considerably in the boiling, wholesome
meat rather swells and does not lose an ounce in weight.


OBSERVATIONS ON PORK, CURING BACON, ETC.

Hogs weighing from 150 to 200 pounds are the most suitable size for
family use. They should not exceed twelve months in age, as they are
much more tender from being young. They should be well kept and should
be corn-fed several weeks before being killed. After being properly
dressed, they should hang long enough to get rid of the animal heat.
When they are ready to be cut up, they should be divided into nine
principal parts, two hams, two shoulders, two middlings, the head or
face, jowl and chine. The hog is laid on its back to be cut up. The
head is cut off just below the ears, then it is split down on each
side of the backbone, which is the chine. This is divided into three
pieces, the upper portion being a choice piece to be eaten cold. The
fat portion may be cut off to make lard. Each half should then first
have the leaf fat taken out, which is done by cutting the thin skin
between it and the ribs, when it is easily pulled out. Just under
this, the next thing to be removed is the mousepiece or tenderloin,
lying along the edge, from which the backbone was removed, commencing
at the point of the ham. This is considered the most delicate part and
is used to make the nicest sausage. Just under this tenderloin are
some short ribs about three inches long, running up from the point of
the ham which are known as the griskin. This is removed by a sharp
knife being run under it, taking care to cut it smooth and not too
thick. When broiled, it is as nice as a partridge.

The ribs are next taken out of the shoulder and middling, though some
persons prefer leaving them in the middling. In this case seven should
be taken from the shoulder, by a sharp knife cutting close to the
ribs, which make a delicious broil. Then cut off the ham as near the
bone as possible, in a half circle. The shoulder is then cut square
across just behind the leg. The feet are then chopped off with a sharp
axe or cleaver. From the shoulder, they should be cut off leaving a
stump of about two inches. From the ham, they should be cut off at the
joint, as smoothly as possible, and then you may proceed to salt the
meat.

In order to impart redness to the hams, rub on each a teaspoonful of
pulverized saltpetre before salting. If the weather is very cold, warm
the salt before applying it. First rub the skin side well with salt
and then the fleshy side, using for the purpose a shoe-sole or leather
glove. No more salt should be used than a sufficiency to preserve the
meat, as an excess hardens the meat. A bushel of salt is sufficient
for a thousand pounds of meat. For the chine and ribs a very light
sprinkling of salt will suffice.

The meat as salted should be packed with the skin side down, where it
should remain from four to six weeks, according to the weather. If the
weather is mild, four weeks will answer. Should the weather be very
cold and the pork in an exposed place, it will freeze, and the salt,
failing to penetrate the meat, will be apt to injure it.

After it has taken salt sufficiently, the old Virginia mode is to
break the bulk, shake off the salt, rub the joint pieces (hams and
shoulders) with good, green-wood ashes (hickory preferred). Then
rebulk it and let it remain two weeks longer, when it should be hung
up with the joints down and the other pieces may be hung up for
smoking at the same time. It is not necessary that the smoke-house
should be very tight, but it is important that the pork should not be
very close to the fire.

A smothered fire made of small billets of wood or chips (hickory
preferred), or of corn cobs, should be made up three times a day till
the middle of March or first of April, when the joint pieces should be
taken down and packed in hickory or other green-wood ashes, as in
salt, where they will remain all the summer without danger of bugs
interfering with them.

This recipe has been obtained from an old Virginia family, famous for
their skill in this department of housekeeping. This mode of curing
makes the best bacon in the world, far superior to what are generally
called Virginia cured hams.

Shoat (which I must explain to the uninitiated is a term applied in
the South to a young pig past the age when it may be cooked whole)
should be kept up and fattened on buttermilk, several weeks before
being killed, as this makes the flesh extremely delicate. It is best
killed when between two and three months old. It should then be
divided into four quarters. It is more delicate and wholesome eaten
cold.


PORK STEAK.

Remove the skin, beat without breaking into holes; scald with boiling
water, wipe dry and broil. When brown lay in a hob dish. Sprinkle over
pepper, salt, a little sage, chopped onion, and parsley; then butter
profusely.

Grate over all hard biscuit or crackers that have been browned and
serve.--_Mrs. S. T._


SPARE-RIBS.

Pork chop and pork cutlet may be cooked in the same way, omitting the
onion if not liked.--_Mrs. T._


PORK SPARE-RIB.

With stuffing of sage and onions, roasted spare-rib, done over the
potatoes, affords a good substitute for goose.


SPARE-RIBS.

Always parboil spare-ribs: then broil with pepper and salt; cut in
pieces three or four bones each.--_Mrs. W._


_Spare-Ribs._

Cut them into pieces of two or three ribs each; put them into a
covered stewpan and boil or stew until perfectly done. Just before you
take them out, add salt, pepper, and minced parsley.

Put on the cover and simmer until well seasoned.

Take them out of the pan, drain and dry them. For one moment let them
scorch on a gridiron over a bed of hot coals; lay on a hot dish;
butter each one; pepper added; sift over browned cracker and
serve.--_Mrs. S. T._


TO COOK SPARE-RIBS AND GRISKIN OR SHORT-RIBS.

Put them on in a small quantity of water and boil for fifteen or
twenty minutes. Gash them with a knife; sprinkle with pepper and put
them on a hot gridiron as near the fire as possible; broil quickly,
but not too brown. Have some butter melted and pour over the meat and
shut it up in the dish. These are good for breakfast.--_Mrs. P. W._


TO COOK BACKBONE OR CHINE.

Cut the chine in three pieces; the large end must be about a foot
long, the remainder cut in half. Put it in a pot of water and boil for
two hours; then put it in a pan, baste and set it in the stove to
brown. Peel some Irish potatoes and put them in the pot; boil till
done, mash them up and season with pepper, a little salt, and some of
the gravy dripping out of the chine while baking; spread them in the
dish, then lay the chine on top. The largest piece is generally put
aside to eat cold, and is very nice. Turnips are good, cooked in the
same way as potatoes, with the chine.

The chine and ham of a hog are nice, corned like beef.--_Mrs. P. W._


BACKBONE PIE.

Take the smallest end of the backbone, cut in pieces two or three
inches long; put in water and boil until done. Make nice rich pastry
as for chicken pie; line the sides of a baking dish with the pastry,
put in the bones, adding some water in which they were boiled; also
salt, butter, and pepper to taste, with bits of pastry.

Cover top of baking-dish with pastry; put in stove and brown
nicely.--_Mrs. G. B._


TO COOK A HAM OF PORK.

Wash off the salt and put it in a pot of water; boil from four to six
hours, according to size. Do not take off the skin, as it preserves
the juice and is much better cold. It is also nice to slice and broil
with pepper and butter over it.--_Mrs. P. W._


LEG OF PORK STUFFED.

Make deep incisions in the meat parallel to the bone, trim it so as to
leave the skin longer than the flesh; then boil some potatoes, and
when they are done, mash them with a piece of butter, cayenne pepper
and salt, an onion finely chopped, and a little rubbed sage.

With this dressing fill the incisions, draw the skin down and skewer
it over to keep the dressing from falling out. Season the outside of
the meat with salt, cayenne pepper and sage.

Roast it slowly; when done, pour the gravy in a pan, skim off the fat
and add some browned flour wet in a little cold water, and boil up
once.

Serve with apple or cranberry sauce.--_Mrs. A. M. D._


TO DRESS CHINE.

Rub the large end with salt and saltpetre, and it will keep some time,
or you may boil it fresh. Cut the bones of the other end apart,
sprinkle with flour and a little salt: add one teacup of water, and
stew.

It will make two large dishes.--_Mrs. W._


ROAST CHINE.

Chine should always be parboiled and stewed before roasting, to take
away the gross taste which the melted fat frying from it gives. After
this lay in the pan with one pint water in which it was boiled, from
which all the fat has been skimmed. Put in this several whole leaves
of sage, to be removed before serving--just to get the flavor; minced
onion, and parsley.

Baste and brown quickly that it may not dry.

This is only stewed chine browned.--_Mrs. S. T._


PORK ROYAL.

Take a piece of shoulder of fresh pork, fill with grated bread and the
crust soaked, pepper, salt, onion, sage and thyme: a bit of butter and
lard. Place in a pan with some water; when about half done, place
around it some large apples; when done, place your pork on a dish,
with the apples round it; put flour and water on your pan, flour
browned, some thyme and sage; boil, strain through a very small
colander over your pork and apples.


SEASONING FOR SAUSAGE.

     18 pounds meat.
     9 pounds back fat.
     2 ounces sage.
     4 ounces black pepper.
     12 ounces salt.--_Mrs. J. P._


EXCELLENT RECIPE FOR SAUSAGE.

     12 pounds of the lean of the chine.
     6 pounds " " fat.
     5 tablespoonfuls salt.
     6     "     sage.
     2     "     thyme.
     5     "     pepper.
     3     "     sweet marjoram.

Mix well together.--_Mrs. S. M._


SAUSAGE MEAT.

     25 pounds lean pieces cut from the shoulder and tenderloin.
     15 pounds fat from the back of the chine.
     1 pound salt; a half pound of black pepper.
     4 ounces allspice.
     1 ounce sage.

Cut the fat in small pieces and then chop it; chop the lean very fine:
mix all together, kneading in the seasoning. Press it down in small
pots and pour melted lard over the top.--_Mrs. J. D._


SWEETBREAD OF HOG.

This nice morsel is between the maw and ruffle piece inside of the
hog. Put them in soak for a day; parboil them and then gash them and
stew them in pepper, butter, one teacup of milk and a little vinegar.

Or they are very nice fried or broiled.--_Mrs. P. W._


SOUSE CHEESE.

Lay the meat in cold water as cut from the hog. Let it stand three or
four days, shifting the water each day. Scrape it and let it stand a
day or two longer, changing the water often, and if it should turn
warm, pour a little salt in the water. The oftener it is scraped, the
whiter will be the souse. Boil in plenty of water to cover it,
replenishing when needed. When tender enough, put it in milk-warm
water, and when cold in salt water. Boil the head until the bones will
almost fall out. Clean one dozen or more ears and boil also; while
hot, chop very fine, and season with pepper and salt.

Put in a mold or bowl with a weight on top. The feet may be soused
whole, or cut up with the head and ears; but it is not so nice. Clean
them by dipping in boiling water and scraping; do not hold them to the
fire to singe off the hair. One head and one dozen ears will make a
good-sized cheese.--_Mrs. W._


TO MAKE SOUSE FROM HOG'S FEET.

As soon as the hog is cleaned, cut off the feet and throw them in a
tub of cold water with a handful of salt; let them remain covered in
water until you are ready to clean them, which should be done as soon
as possible, as they will be much whiter. To get the hoof off, put the
feet in hot water (not above the hoof); as soon as they get hot
enough, slip a knife between the foot and hoof, and slip it off; then
scrape the foot nicely, and throw into a tub of clear water; do this
for several days. When you have scraped and changed the water for a
week, then wash them clean and put them on to boil. First put them in
a clean pot with a thin gruel made of corn meal; boil until half done.
Wash them off, and put on in clear hot water, and boil till done, then
take them up and throw them into a firkin of clean salt and water;
keep closely covered to prevent them from molding. They are now ready
to fry, which should be done by splitting the foot in half and fried
in egg batter.--_Mrs. P. W._


TO CURE LARD.

As soon as it is taken from the hog, cut in small pieces, wash clean,
press out the water, and put in the pot to boil, with one gallon of
water to a vessel holding four gallons. Boil briskly until nearly
done, or until the cracklins begin to brown, then cook slowly to
prevent burning. The cracklins should be of a light brown and crisp,
and will sink to the bottom when done. This is Leaf Lard.

The fat off of the backbone is also very nice, done in the same way,
and does not require soaking, unless bloody. The fat from the entrails
can also be made into nice lard by soaking for a day or two in fresh
water, changing it frequently, and throwing a handful of salt in the
tub of water to draw out the blood and impurities. When ready to
render, wash in warm water twice and boil in more water than you do
for leaf lard. The cracklins will not become crisp, but remain soft,
and will sink to the bottom; they are used for making soap.


VIRGINIA MODE OF CURING HAMS.

Put one teaspoonful saltpetre on the fleshy side of each ham. Salt
_not too heavily_ for five weeks; if the weather is freezing cold, six
weeks; then brush the hams well, and rub them with hickory ashes; let
them lie for one week, then hang and smoke them for six weeks with
green hickory chips. After brushing, pack them in hickory ashes in a
bulk.--_Mrs. P. C. M._


TO CURE BACON.

Pack the meat in salt and allow it to remain five weeks. Then take the
hams up, wash off, and wipe dry. Have some sacks made of about
seven-eighths shirting, large enough to hold the hams and tie above
the hock. Make a pot of sizing of equal portions of flour and corn
meal, boil until thick, and dip each sack until the outside is well
coated with sizing. Put the hams in bags, and tie tight with a strong
twine and hang by the same in the smoke-house.


CURING BACON.

One peck salt to five hundred pounds pork. To five gallons water:

     4 pounds salt.
     1 pound sugar.
     1 pint molasses.
     1 teaspoonful saltpetre.

Mix, and after sprinkling the fleshy side of the ham with the salt,
pack in a tight barrel. Hams first, then shoulders, middlings. Pour
over the brine; leave the meat in brine from four to seven
weeks.--_Mrs. Dr. J._


FOR CURING HAMS.

For five hundred pounds hams.

     1 peck and 11/2 gallons fine Liverpool salt.
     13/4 pounds saltpetre.
     1 quart hickory ashes well sifted.
     1 quart molasses.
     2 teacups cayenne pepper.
     1 teacup black pepper.

Mix these ingredients well together in a large tub, rub it into each
ham with a brick, or something rough to get it in well. Pack in a
tight, clean tub and weigh down. Let the hams remain six weeks; then
take them out and rub each one on the fleshy side with one
tablespoonful black pepper to avoid skippers. Hang in the meat house,
and smoke with green hickory for from ten to twelve hours a day for
six weeks, not suffering the wood to blaze. On the 1st of April, take
them down and pack in any coal ashes or pine ashes well slaked. Strong
ashes will rot into the meat.--_Mrs. R. M._


AN IMPROVEMENT TO HAMS.

Sometimes very good bacon is found to be of a bad color when cooked.
This may be remedied by keeping it in ashes (hickory is best) for a
few weeks before using. Must then be hung up, with ashes adhering,
until needed. This also prevents skippers.--_Mrs. S. T._


TO BOIL A HAM WEIGHING TEN POUNDS.

Let it soak for twenty-four hours, changing the water two or three
times. Boil it slowly eight or ten hours: when done, put it into a
dish, as nearly as possible the shape of a ham, taking care first to
take out the bone--turn the rind down. When cold, turn it out into a
large dish, garnish with jelly and ornamental paper. Serve with the
rind on. To be eaten cold.--_Mrs. W. C. R._


TO BOIL HAM.

Put in the water one pint vinegar, a bay leaf, a little thyme, and
parsley.

Boil slowly for two hours, if it weighs ten pounds; then bake. Soak
all hams twenty-four hours before cooking.--_Mrs. M._


_To Boil Ham._

The day before you wish to boil a ham, scrape, wash and wipe it dry,
and put it in the sun. At night put it into water and soak till next
morning. Then lay it with the skin down in a boiler of cold water, and
boil slowly for five hours. If the ham is large, boil six hours. When
perfectly done and tender, set the boiler aside, with the ham and
liquor undisturbed, until cold. Then take off the skin, sprinkle black
pepper over thickly, and sift over crackers first browned and pounded;
for special occasions, place at equal distances over the ham, scraped
horseradish in lozenge shape, and edged with curled parsley. This mode
keeps the ham juicy.--_Mrs. S. T._


BAKED HAM.

First of all, soak an old ham overnight, having first washed and
scraped it. Next morning put in a boiler of milk-warm water with the
skin side down. Boil slowly for four or five hours, according to size,
and if a very large ham, six hours. When done, set aside the boiler
with the ham and liquor in it, to remain until cold, when the skin
must be taken off, and it must be trimmed of a nice shape. Sprinkle
over two tablespoonfuls black pepper. Lay the ham on a grating or
twist in the baking-pan, in which pour a pint of water, and set it in
a hot oven. This mode prevents the frying so disagreeable to the
taste. After the ham is heated through, and the pepper strikes in,
sift over cracker; return to the oven and brown, then decorate with
scraped horseradish and parsley, and serve.--_Mrs. S. T._


BAKED HAM OR TONGUES.

Boil the ham and grate some powdered cracker thickly over it; first
rubbing it with beaten yolk of egg. Bake with butter. Lay slices of
currant jelly around the tongue, and garnish the ham with
parsley.--_Mrs. R._


_Baked Ham._

Most persons boil ham, but it is much better if baked properly. Soak
it for an hour in clean water and wipe dry; next spread it all over
with a thin batter, put it into a deep dish with sticks under it to
keep it out of the gravy. When it is fully done, take off the skin and
batter crusted upon the flesh side and set it away to cool.--_Mrs. B.
J. B._


STUFFED AND BAKED HAM.

After your ham is boiled, take the skin off. Take pepper, allspice,
cloves and mace, well pounded; add a little bread crumbs, and a little
brown sugar; mix with a little butter and water.

Gash your ham and take out plugs; fill in with the mixture. Rub the
ham with an egg beaten, and grate on bread crumbs and white sugar.

Put in the oven and brown.--_Mrs. D. R._


TO STUFF FRESH CURED HAM.

     Boil the ham.
     Take one-half pound grated cracker or bread.
     1/2 pound butter.
     1 teaspoonful spice.
     1 teaspoonful cloves.
     1 teaspoonful nutmeg.
     1 teaspoonful ginger.
     1 teaspoonful mace.
     3 spoonfuls sugar.
     Celery-seed or celery.
     6 eggs, beaten light.
     1 spoonful mustard.

Mix all well together and moisten with cream, if too stiff. Whilst the
ham is hot, make holes to the bone and fill with this mixture. Put in
the stove to brown.


SPICED HAM.

Salt the hams for two days; put them in a keg and for each ham add:

     1/2 cup molasses.
     1 tablespoonful spice.
     1 tablespoonful black pepper.
     A pinch of saltpetre.

Let them stand four days, turning each day, then hang them up.--_Mrs.
D. R._


BROILED HAM.

To have this dish in a perfection, ham must first be soaked, then
boiled nearly done, and set aside to take slices from, as wanted. Cut
rather thin, lay on a gridiron over hot coals; when hot through, lay
on a dish, and pepper well. Pour over fresh butter melted, and serve.
If a raw ham is used, the slices must be cut thicker, dropped in a pan
of boiling water for a few minutes, then broiled as above.--_Mrs. S.
T._


FRIED HAM.

The slices are always taken from a raw ham, but are most delicate when
first simmered a short time: five minutes in a stewpan, dried with a
clean cloth and put in a hot frying-pan, first removing the skin. The
pan must be hot enough to scorch and brown both ham and gravy quickly.
Lay the slices on a hot dish, pour into the gravy half a teacup new
milk, pepper, and minced parsley; boil up and serve.--_Mrs. S. T._


SHOULDER OF BACON.

This piece is not used until cured or smoked, it is then boiled with
cabbage or salad, as you would the middling. It is inferior to the ham
or middling.--_Mrs. P. W._


BACON AND GREENS.

The middling is generally used for this purpose: cut a piece about a
foot square, boil three hours.

Take a good head of cabbage, cut, quarter, and wash clean; press the
water out as dry as you can. Boil them one or two hours with half a
pod of red pepper; put them on a dish and the middling on top. You can
fry the cabbage next day, and make a savory dish, but it does not suit
dyspeptics. The thin part of the middling is used for frying, and is
called "breakfast bacon."--_Mrs. P. W._


FRIED BACON.

Dip the ham or slices of middling in bread crumbs. Put in a frying-pan
with chopped parsley and pepper. Just before taking off the fire, pour
to the gravy a cup of cream.--_Mrs. W._


JOWL AND TURNIP SALAD.

This is an old Virginia dish, and much used in the spring of the year.

The jowl, which must have been well smoked, must be washed clean, and
boiled for three hours. Put in the salad, and boil half an hour; if
you boil too long, it will turn yellow. It is also good broiled for
breakfast with pepper and butter over it.

The jaw-bone should be removed before sending to the table; this is
easily done by running a knife around the lip and under the tongue.
The jowl and salad should always be served with fresh poached
eggs.--_Mrs. P. W._


PICKLED PORK EQUAL TO FRESH.

Let the meat cool thoroughly; cut into pieces four to six inches wide,
weigh them and pack them as tight as possible in a barrel, salting
very slightly. Cover the meat with brine made as strong as possible.
Pour off a gallon of brine and mix with it one tablespoonful saltpetre
for every 100 pounds meat and return it to the barrel. Let it stand
one month, then take out the meat, let it drain twelve hours. Put the
brine in an iron kettle, and one quart treacle or two pounds sugar,
and boil until perfectly clear. When it is cold, return the meat to
the barrel and pour on the brine. Weight it down and keep it covered
close, and you will have the sweetest meat you ever tasted.


HOW TO COOK SALT PORK.

Many people do not relish salt pork fried, but it is quite good to
soak it in milk two or three hours, then roll in Indian meal and fry
to a light brown. This makes a good dish with mashed turnips, or raw
onions cut in vinegar; another way is to soak it over night in skimmed
milk and bake like fresh pork; it is almost as good as fresh roast
pork.


HAM TOAST.

Mince about one pint boiled lean ham.

Add the yolks of three eggs well beaten, two tablespoonfuls cream, and
a little cayenne pepper.

Stir all on the fire until it thickens, and spread on hot toast with
the crust cut off.--_Mrs. J. T. B._


HAM TOAST.

Chop very fine two spoonfuls of lean ham that has been cooked; take
two spoonfuls veal gravy; a few bread crumbs.

Put all together in a stewpan and heat it. Have ready a toast
buttered, spread the above upon it, strew a few bread crumbs over it
and brown it before the fire.--_Mrs. S._


HAM RELISH.

Cut a slice of dressed ham, season it highly with cayenne pepper and
broil it brown; then spread mustard over it, squeeze on it a little
lemon juice, and serve quickly.


POTTED TONGUE OR HAM.

Remove all skin, gristle, and outside parts from one pound of the lean
of cold boiled tongue or ham.

Pound it in a mortar to a smooth paste with either one-quarter pound
of the fat, or with two ounces fresh butter. Season with cayenne,
pounded mace and allspice.

Press it well into pots and cover with clarified butter or fat.


TO ROAST SHOAT.

The hind-quarter is considered best. Cut off the foot, leaving the
hock quite short. Wash well and put into boiling water; simmer until
done, adding salt and pepper just before lifting from the kettle; salt
put in sooner hardens and toughens. Place the meat in a baking-pan and
score across, in the direction in which it is to be carved. Skim
several ladlefuls from the top of the kettle and pour over; after this
has dried off, sprinkle over a little salt and pepper, cover with an
egg beaten stiff, sift over powdered cracker, and set to brown. Lay
around sweet potatoes first parboiled, then cut in thick slices. Serve
with minced parsley and thyme, both on the meat and in the
gravy.--_Mrs. S. T._


TO ROAST A FORE QUARTER OF SHOAT.

Put it on in hot water, boil for half an hour; take it out, put in a
pan, gash it across with a sharp knife, in diamond shapes, grease it
with lard and dredge with flour, pepper and a little salt. Peel some
good Irish potatoes, lay them around the pan and set in the stove to
brown, basting frequently. This meat should be cooked done, as it is
not good the least rare. Grate some bread crumbs over it and
serve.--_Mrs. P. W._


TO BARBECUE SHOAT.

Lay the shoat in water till ready for use; if small, it will cook in
an hour. Put in the oven with two spoonfuls of water, a piece of lard,
and dredge with flour. When ready for use, pour in half a teacup of
walnut catsup, and, if not fat, a piece of butter.


SHOAT JOWL.

The upper half of the head is what is generally used for what is
called "The Pig's-head Stew." Another nice dish may be made of the
under jaw or jowl by parboiling until the jaw-bone can be taken out;
always adding pepper and salt just before it is done. When perfectly
tender, score across; pepper and salt again, cover with beaten egg,
then with cracker. Set in a pan with some of the water in which it was
boiled. Put in a hot oven and brown.--_Mrs. S. T._


ROAST PIG.

When roasted whole, a pig should not be under four nor over six weeks
old. In town, the butcher prepares for roasting, but it is well to
know, in the country, how this may be done. As soon as the pig is
killed, throw it into a tub of cold water, to make it tender; as soon
as cold, take it by the hind leg, and plunge into scalding, not
boiling water (as the last cooks the skin so that the hair can with
difficulty be removed), shake it about until the hair can be removed
by the handful. When all that is possible has been taken off in this
way, rub from the tail up to the end of the nose with a coarse cloth.
Take off the hoofs, scrape and wash the ears and nose until perfectly
clean. The nicest way to dress it is to hang it by the hind legs, open
and take out the entrails; wash well with water, with a little soda
dissolved in it; rinse again and again, and leave hanging an hour.
Wrap in a coarse cloth wrung out of cold water and lay on ice or in a
cool cellar until next morning, when, if the weather is warm, it must
be cooked. It should never be used the same day that it is killed.

First prepare the stuffing of the liver, heart and haslets of the pig,
stewed, seasoned, and chopped. Mix with these an equal quantity of
boiled potatoes mashed; add a large spoonful of butter, with some
hard-boiled eggs, parsley and thyme, chopped fine, pepper and salt.

Scald the pig on the inside, dry it and rub with pepper and salt,
fill and sew up. Bend the fore legs under the body, the hind legs
forward, under the pig, and skewer to keep in position. Place in a
large baking-pan, pour over one quart of boiling water. Have a lump of
fresh butter tied up in a clean rag; rub it all over the pig, then
sprinkle over pepper and salt, putting some in the pan with a bunch of
herbs; invert over it a baking-pan while it simmers, and steam until
entirely done. Underdone pork, shoat, or pig, is both unpalatable and
unwholesome. Remove the pan, rub over with the butter and baste often.
When of a fine brown, cover the edges of a large dish with a deep
fringe of curled parsley; first sift over the pig powdered cracker,
then place it, kneeling, in the green bed. Place in its mouth an
orange or a red apple; and, if eaten hot, serve with the gravy in a
tureen or sauce-boat. It is much nicer cold; served with little mounds
of grated horseradish amongst the parsley.--_Mrs. S. T._


TO STEW PIG'S HEAD AND JOWL.

Clean the head and feet; take out the bone above the nose; cut off the
ears, clean them nicely. Separate the jowl from the head; take care of
the brains to add to the stew. Put the head, jowl, feet and part of
the liver in water sufficient to keep well covered; boil until quite
done. Split the feet to put on the dish; hash the head and liver; but
do not spoil the jowl, which must be put in the middle of the dish and
surrounded with the feet and hash. Put all of the hash, jowl and feet
in the pot and season with a cup of cream, a lump of butter, pepper
and salt, a tablespoonful walnut catsup, an onion chopped fine, a
stalk of celery.

A teaspoonful mustard improves it.

Stew half an hour; thicken the gravy with grated bread.--_Mrs. P. W._


SHOAT'S HEAD.

Get a shoat's head and clean it nicely. Boil and chop in pieces.
Season with:

     2 tablespoonfuls tomato catsup.
     2 tablespoonfuls walnut catsup.
     2 cups water.
     A little flour.
     1 large spoonful butter.
     Pepper and salt.

Have two or three hard-boiled eggs, cut them in half and lay on the
top of the head; set it in the oven to bake.

Veal or mutton head, can be cooked in the same way, but are not so
nice.--_Mrs. R._


SHOAT'S HEAD, TO STEW.

Clean the head and feet; and put them on to parboil with the liver.
Then split up the head, through the nose, taking out the bones. Cut
the meat from the feet and chop up with the liver, season this with
pepper and salt.

Lay the head open and fill it with this mince and the yolks of some
hard-boiled eggs: if this does not fill the head, add some grated
bread crumbs or crackers and butter.

Sew up the head and bind it with thread; put it in the pot with the
water it has been parboiled in and let it stew slowly. Take up the
head, and add to the gravy a lump of butter, rolled in flour, some
browning and some walnut catsup. Pour this over the head, which should
be brown. If the shoat is not very small, use bread and butter instead
of the liver.--_Mrs. R._


TO HASH PIG'S HEAD.

Take head, feet, and haslet of pig; boil them until done, then cut
them up fine, taking out the bones.

     Add black pepper, salt, a little sage.
     2 onions chopped fine.
     A little red pepper.
     1 teaspoonful mace.
     1 teaspoonful cloves.

Put it back in the same vessel with liquor and cook till done, then
thicken with a little flour. Add two hard-boiled eggs and one cup
walnut catsup.--_Mrs. Dr. J._




BEEF AND VEAL.


In selecting beef, see that the flesh is firm and of a clear red, and
the fat of a yellowish white. In buying a quarter of beef, it is
better to have it cut up by the butcher, if you are living in town.
The hind quarter is considered better, and sells higher than the fore
quarter. If a roasting piece is desired, the sirloin from the hind
quarter is usually preferred. It is not generally known, however, that
the second cut of the rib-roast from the fore quarter is the finest
roast from the beef.

When the bone has been removed, and the meat skewered in the shape of
a round, by the butcher, it is well to roast it on a spit before an
open fire. If the latter cannot be obtained, however, plunge the beef
for a moment in boiling water, then rub well with salt and pepper,
dredge with flour, and place on a little grate or trivet which will
readily go in a baking-pan. In this pour about a pint of the water in
which the beef was scalded. Place it in a very hot oven, with an
inverted tin plate on top of the roast. Remove this plate often to
baste the meat. When nearly done, which will be in about two hours for
a roast of six pounds, baste several times and bake a nice brown.
Season the gravy with minced onion, parsley and thyme, add a little
salt and pepper and a tablespoonful of the meat flavoring of which a
receipt was given in the general directions about meat. Serve the
gravy in a sauce-tureen, so that each person may choose whether to eat
the beef with gravy or with the juice that escapes from the meat while
it is being carved. The latter mixed with grated horseradish is
preferred to gravy by some persons.

Every portion of the beef, from head to feet, is useful and delicious
when properly prepared.

The rounds and rump pieces are generally used for beef _a la mode_.

Fresh beef from the ribs, boiled with turnips, is considered a nice
dish by some persons.

For steak, nothing is so nice as tenderloin or porter-house steak. I
take this occasion to protest against the unwholesome custom of frying
steak in lard. When inconvenient to broil, it may be deliciously
cooked by being first beaten till tender, then laid in a hot
frying-pan, closely covered, and cooked without lard or butter, in its
own juices. When scorched brown on both sides, but not hard, remove
the pan from the fire, pepper and salt the steak, and put a large
tablespoonful of fresh butter on it. Press this in with a knife and
fork, turning the steak, so that each side may absorb the butter.
Serve on a hot dish. The whole process will not consume five minutes.
Some persons think it best to add the salt after the steak is done,
though many good housekeepers salt and pepper the steak before
broiling it. Beefsteak should be cooked rare; it is a great mistake to
cook it till hard and indigestible.

The parts most suitable for soup are the head, neck, shank, and all
the unsightly parts. After the bones are broken and the meat boiled
from them, the liquor is used for soup, while the meat, picked or cut
to pieces, will make an excellent stew seasoned with potatoes,
turnips, sweet herbs, one tablespoonful of butter and the same of meat
flavoring.

It is well always to keep brine on hand for corning beef. All the
parts not desirable for roast or steak had better be corned.

The beef, after being dressed, should be hung up by the hind legs,
with a smooth, round piece of timber sufficiently strong to hold the
weight, passed through the legs at the hock, or run between the tendon
and bone, with short pegs to keep the legs stretched apart. Then with
a sharp axe, standing behind the suspended beef, split it down the
backbone, severing it in half. Then pass a knife through the ribs,
leaving two or three short ribs on the hind-quarter. Sever the
backbone with an axe. Then cut with a sharp knife straight across the
parallel line with the spinal bone, which piece must be divided into
two pieces, the sirloin and steak. Then take off two rounds, or three,
according to the size of the animal, cutting with a sharp knife, and
cutting the bone with a meat saw or axe, as near the joints as
possible, which leaves the shin-bone.

The fore quarter then is divided into four pieces, after taking off
the shoulder, which may be divided into three or more pieces.

The loin of veal is the nicest part, and is always roasted.

The fillets and knuckles may be stewed and roasted.

The latter is nicest for soup.

The breast may be stewed or roasted.

The cutlets are nicest from the legs or fillet.

The head is a dish for soup, stew or pie.

Sweetbreads from the throat make a delicious dish, much prized by
epicureans.

The feet, boiled till the bones drop out, make a delightful dish,
fried in batter, while the water in which they are boiled makes
excellent jelly.

Veal, to be eaten in its perfection, should be killed when from four
to six weeks old.


BEEF.

The sirloin, or fore and middle ribs, are best for roasting.

The steaks are best cut from the ribs, or the inner part of the
sirloin; shank, tail and head make nice soup.--_Mrs. W._


TO ROAST BEEF.

Lay the meat on some sticks in a dripping-pan or other vessel, so that
it will not touch the water which it is necessary to have in the
bottom. Season with salt and pepper, and put in the oven three or
four hours before it is wanted for the table. Baste it often with the
water in the bottom of the pan, renewing it as often as it gets low.
This makes sweet, juicy roast beef. The great secret of it is, not to
have the meat touch the water in the bottom of the pan, and to baste
it often. Tough, unpromising pieces of beef are best cooked by
steaming them an hour and a half or so and then putting them in the
oven and roasting as much longer.

Crackers, first browned and then pounded, should always be kept to
sift over roast meats: and curled parsley to garnish with. Grated
horseradish is also excellent with the roast.--_Mrs. S. T._


RIB ROAST OF BEEF.

Get, from the butcher, a rib-roast--the second cut is best--and get
him to take out the bones, and roll and skewer it: if this is not
convenient, it can be done at home with a sharp knife. Before
roasting, take out the wooden skewers put in at market, unroll, season
well with salt and pepper and anything else liked, and roll again
tightly, fastening securely with the iron skewer pins. Put it in a pan
on a little iron griddle or trivet, made for the purpose to keep it
just over the pint of water in the pan. Pepper and salt freely, dredge
with flour and baste. Some persons like half a teacup of pepper
vinegar, poured over just before it is done; and minced onion, thyme
and parsley added to the gravy, which should be brown.--_Mrs. B._


TO ROAST BEEF.

The sirloin is the nicest for the purpose.

Plunge the beef in boiling water and boil for thirty minutes: then put
it in the stove-pan; skim the top of the water in which it has been
boiled, and baste the roast, after dredging it with flour; pepper and
salt to taste. Baste frequently, and roast till done.--_Mrs. P. W._


BEEF A LA MODE.

Take, from a round of fresh beef, the bone; beat the meat all over
slightly to make tender. Grate a loaf of bread, mix with it equal
quantities of--

     Thyme and parsley, rubbed fine.
     1 onion.
     The marrow from the bone.
     1/4 pound suet.
     Pepper and salt, cloves and nutmeg to the taste.

Mix these ingredients with three eggs well beaten: fill the place from
whence came the bone, and what is left rub all over the round: fasten
well with a tape, tied round to keep in shape. Cover the pan with
slices of bacon, lay the beef upon them, baste with butter: pour in
the pan a pint of water. Cover closely and stew gently for six hours;
when thoroughly done, take out the beef, skim the fat from the gravy,
strain into a saucepan, set it on the stove and stir into it one
teacup Port wine. Let it come to a boil and send to the table in a
sauce tureen. You may, for supper, dish cold: dress with vegetable
flowers, whites of eggs boiled hard and chopped fine.--_Mrs. J. W. S._


_Beef a la Mode._

Take a round or a rump piece of beef, take out the bone, the gristle
and all the tough pieces about the edges. Fill the cavities from which
the bone was taken, with suet, and fat salt pork.

Press this so as to make it perfectly round, pass around a coarse,
strong piece of cloth, so as to hold it firmly in shape. If the round
is six inches thick, the cloth must be six inches wide, leaving the
top and bottom open. With a larding needle, fill this thickly with
strips of fat pork, running through from top to bottom and about one
inch apart each way. Set this in a baking-pan, pour over:

     1 teacup boiling water,
     1 teacup boiling vinegar; mixed.

Add to this one heaping tablespoonful brown sugar and a bunch of
herbs.

Sprinkle over the beef liberally with salt and black pepper; chop one
small onion fine, and lay over top of the beef. Simmer this for two or
three hours, basting frequently and keeping an inverted tin plate over
the beef except when basting. If the gravy stews down too much, add
stock or broth of any kind. Turn it over, and let the top be at the
bottom. When it is done and tender, skim the fat from the gravy. Pour
over:

     2 tablespoonfuls celery vinegar.
     2 tablespoonfuls pepper.
     2 tablespoonfuls made mustard.
     1 wineglassful acid fruit jelly.

Simmer and bake for two hours longer, frequently basting, that it may
be soft and seasoned through and through. Take the beef from the pan
and remove the cloth; place in a large flat dish, pour over the gravy,
and over this one teacup of mushroom sauce. Sift finely powdered
cracker over the top and garnish with grated or scraped horseradish
and parsley.--_Mrs. S. T._


_Beef a la Mode._

     To 10 pounds of beef, 4 onions chopped up.
     1 tablespoonful allspice, 1 teaspoonful mace.
     Red pepper and salt to the taste.
     1 pint strong vinegar.

Rub the beef in the mixture for three or four days, then cook, with
all these ingredients. The H piece is generally the part taken for
this purpose.--_Mrs. M. B._


BOILED BEEF AND TURNIPS.

The brisket or breast of beef is nicest for boiling. Keep sufficiently
covered in water, boiling three hours, or until tender.

Peel and slice half a dozen turnips and put with beef, boiling until
soft enough to mash with a spoon, which will require about thirty
minutes. Dress with one teacup of milk, pepper and salt to the taste.

Stew together a short time and put in bottom of dish with beef on the
top.--_Mrs. P. W._


TO COLLAR BEEF.

Take a flank of fresh beef, stew it with pepper, salt, allspice,
saltpetre, thyme, and sage.

Then roll as hard as you can, and wind a string around it; then boil
till done. It must be served up cold, cut in slices.--_Mrs. M. P._


ROLLED BEEFSTEAK.

Beat a large tender steak thoroughly and carefully.

Sprinkle over salt, pepper, sage, minced onion, minced parsley, and
bits of butter.

Have ready some mealy Irish potatoes mashed fine, and seasoned with a
little butter and salt. Spread over all, and roll up tightly: fasten
the ends and sides securely with skewer pins. Place in a pan with such
broth or gravy as may be on hand; if none, two teacups of boiling
water, and one small minced onion, pepper, salt, and one slice of
pork.

Simmer and baste as you would a roast duck. Sift over it browned
cracker, pounded fine. Very nice.--_Mrs. S. T._


BEEFSTEAK BROILED.

Cut the steak one-half inch thick; it should then be beaten with a
steak beater or pestle. The griddle should be hot and on the coals:
place the steak on the griddle, and as soon as seared, turn it; when
both sides are seared, place it in a pan, season it with pepper, salt,
and butter: repeat this for every piece of steak, and place in the
pan, which should be kept closely covered without being on the fire.
If your heat is sufficient, from three to five minutes is sufficient
to cook.--_Mrs. P. W._


BROILED STEAK.

A porter-house steak is considered, by some persons, best, others
prefer the tenderloin. Beat either tender, and place on a gridiron
over coals, frequently turning. Have ready a hot dish, place the steak
on it, pepper and salt well, then with a knife and fork profusely
butter, with one large tablespoonful fresh butter, turning and
pressing it so as to absorb the butter; pepper again and set the dish
over boiling water until wanted, when it will be found tender and
juicy, if not cooked too long on a gridiron. One tablespoonful pepper
vinegar gives this the taste of venison, and to this may be added one
tablespoonful made mustard, for those who like highly seasoned
food.--_Mrs. S. T._


HOW TO COOK BEEFSTEAK.

Take a thin, long-handled frying-pan, put it on the stove and heat it
quite hot. In this put the pieces of steak previously pounded, but do
not put a particle of butter in the frying-pan and do not salt the
steak. Allow the steak to merely glaze over and then turn it quickly
to the other side, turning it several times in this manner, until it
is done. Four minutes is sufficient for cooking. When done, lay it on
the platter, previously warmed; butter and salt, and set a moment in
the hot oven. Allow the steak to heat but a moment on each side; this
helps it to retain all its sweet juices, and putting on the salt at
the last moment, after it is on the platter, draws out its
juices.--_Mrs. S. T._


BEEFSTEAK FRIED WITH ONIONS.

Prepare the steak as for broiling, pepper and roll in flour and fry in
lard; remove the steak from the pan when done; add to the gravy one
chopped onion, pepper, salt, one-half teacup water, and a little
mustard.

Cook a few minutes, put the steak in the gravy--let it remain a short
time; send to the table hot.--_Mrs. P. W._


TO FRY STEAK.

Hunt up all the pickle and take from each one teacup vinegar, lay the
steak in a deep dish, pour over the vinegar and let it stand one hour.
Take a clean frying-pan, throw in one ounce butter, and some of the
vinegar from the dish, sufficient to stew the steak. If managed
properly, when done it will be imbedded in a thick gravy. Put the
steak in a hot dish, before the fire; into the pan, put one spoonful
black pepper, one or two of catsup, and one of raw mustard.--_Mrs. S._


_Fried Steak._

Get from the butcher a tenderloin or porter-house steak. Do not wash
it, but be careful to lay it on a clean block and beat it well, but
not into holes, nor so as to look ragged. Sprinkle over pepper and
salt, then dredge with flour on both sides.

Have ready a hot frying-pan, lay in the steak and cover closely. The
juice of the meat will be sufficient to cook it. Turn often, as the
pan must be hot enough to scorch and make the steak and gravy brown.

Before it gets hard or overdone, butter liberally; place in a hot
dish. Pepper again, and, if preferred, pour over first one
tablespoonful pepper vinegar, then one tablespoonful made mustard, and
turn in over all the hot gravy. Sift powered cracker over and
serve.--_Mrs. S. T._


FRIZZLED BEEF.

Shred some dried beef, parboil it until it is sufficiently freshened,
drain off the water and add enough boiling water to cover it. Rub
equal quantities of butter and flour together until smooth, then add
to the beef. Beat up three eggs, yolks and whites together, stir these
in with a little pepper, a couple of minutes before taking from the
fire. This is to be served hot on toast.--_Mrs. F._


FRICASSEED BEEF.

Take any piece of beef from the fore quarter, such as is generally
used for corning, and cook it tender in just water enough to have it
all evaporate in cooking. When about half done, put in salt enough to
season well, and half teaspoonful pepper. If the water should not boil
away soon enough, turn it off, and let the beef fry fifteen
minutes--it is better than the best roast beef. Take two
tablespoonfuls flour, adding the fat--when mixed, pour on the hot
juice of the meat. Serve with apple sauce.--_Mrs. D._


BEEF STEW.

This is best when made of slices cut from an underdone roast, and
simmered in any liquor in which meat has been boiled, but if none is
at hand, use water instead--just covering the beef.

To a half dozen slices of the usual size, add:

     2 tablespoonfuls pepper vinegar.
     1 tablespoonful of made mustard.
     1 tablespoonful of acid fruit jelly.
     1 tablespoonful of butter.
     1 teaspoonful salt.
     1 teaspoonful celery-seed.
     1 saltspoonful black pepper.
     1 raw turnip, grated or scraped fine.
     1 mashed Irish potato.
     Add minced onion and parsley.
     Boil up and serve.

Cold beefsteak or mutton chops, which are always unfit to appear upon
the table a second time, are delicious cut up in small pieces and
mixed or stewed separately in this way.--_Mrs. S. T._


TO STEW A RUMP OF BEEF.

Stuff the beef with shallots, thyme, parsley, chopped fine, slips of
bacon, pepper, salt and allspice. Then lay it in a pot with water
sufficient to keep it from burning before it is done. Thicken the
gravy with burnt flour and butter, and when it is served up, pour a
little wine over it and strew the top with allspice.--_Mrs. M. P._


LEBANON STEW.

Take scraps of raw beef, such as are not fit for boiling, cut very
fine, picking out all the strings, and put into a kettle, and more
than cover with cold water. Let it boil several hours, or until the
water is nearly all gone. Season with butter, pepper and salt. It is
rich and needs but little seasoning. Serve hot, as you would
hash.--_Mrs. S. T._


BEEF COLLAPS.

     11/2 pounds lean beef, chopped fine.
     1 tablespoonful lard.
     1 tablespoonful of butter.
     With enough water to cook it.

After being well cooked, thicken gravy, and season with vinegar and
pepper.--_Mrs. H. D._


TO STEW BEEF TONGUE.

Put a fresh tongue in water sufficient to cover it, and let it simmer
six or seven hours. Skim the gravy well. Half an hour before dishing
it, add one-half wineglassful wine, one-half wineglassful walnut
catsup, a little mace, and a few cloves to the gravy, and stew awhile
together.--_Mrs. S. T._


TONGUE A LA TERRAPIN.

Take a freshly salted tongue and boil tender; take out, and split it,
stick a few cloves in, cut up a small onion, put in some sticks of
mace, and a little brown flour.

Have water enough in a stewpan to cover the tongue; mix in the
ingredients, before putting in the tongue. Three hard-boiled eggs
chopped up fine and put in the stew. Add a glass of wine just before
taking up. Send to the table hot, garnished with hard boiled eggs cut
in rings.--_Mrs. L. C._


TONGUE TOAST.

Take cold tongue that has been well boiled, mince fine, mix it well
with cream or a little milk, if there is no cream. Add the beaten yolk
of one egg and give it a simmer over the fire. Toast nicely some thin
slices of stale bread and, having buttered, lay them in a flat dish,
that has been heated, then cover the toast with the tongue and serve
up directly.--_Mrs. S._


TO ROAST AN OX HEART.

Wash it well and clean all the blood carefully from the pipes; parboil
it ten or fifteen minutes in boiling water; drain and put in a
stuffing which has been made of bread crumbs, minced suet or butter,
thyme or parsley, salt, pepper, and nutmeg.

Put it down to roast while hot, baste it well with butter, and just
before serving, stir one tablespoonful currant jelly into the gravy.
To roast, allow twenty minutes to every pound.--_Mrs. A. M. D._


BEEF HEART.

Parboil the heart until nearly tender, then gash and stuff with rich
stuffing of loaf bread, seasoned with onion, salt, pepper, and sage.
Then put in a pan and bake, turning it several times. Baste with gravy
whilst baking.--_Mrs. J. H._


STEWED KIDNEYS.

Soak the kidneys for several hours, put them on to boil until tender.
Roll them in flour, add a lump of butter the size of an egg, two
spoonfuls catsup--any kind will answer, though walnut is the best;
pepper and salt to the taste. Stew them until well seasoned.--_Mrs. P.
W._


TO STEW BEEF KIDNEYS.

Cut into pieces and stew in water, with a nice addition of savory
herbs, pepper and salt, and a handful flour to thicken the gravy;
flavor and color the latter with burnt sugar.--_Mrs. H._


KIDNEYS FRIED.

After plunging in boiling water, cut them in thin slices and fry in
hot butter; add pepper, salt, and toss them for a few minutes in rich
brown gravy.--_Mrs. M._


BEEF KIDNEY, TO FRY.

Trim and cut the kidney in slices; season them with salt and pepper,
and dredge well with flour; fry on both sides, and when done, lift
them out, empty the pan and make a gravy for them with a small piece
of butter, one dessertspoonful flour, pepper, salt, and a cup of
boiling water. Shake these around and give them a minute's simmering;
add a little tomato or mushroom catsup, lemon juice, vinegar, or any
good sauce to give it a flavor. Minced herbs are to many tastes an
improvement to this dish, to which a small quantity of onion may be
added when it is liked.--_Mrs. A. M. D._


KIDNEYS GRILLED.

Prepare them as for stewing, cut each kidney in half and dip them in
egg beaten up with salt and pepper; bread-crumb them, dip them in
melted butter, bread-crumb them again, then grill before a slow fire;
serve with Worcestershire or some other sauce.--_Mrs. K._


BROILED KIDNEYS.

Plunge some kidneys in boiling water; open them down the centre, but
do not separate them; peel and pass a skewer across them to keep them
open; pepper, salt, and dip them in melted butter.

Broil them over a clear fire on both sides, doing the cut side first;
remove the skewer, have ready some maitre d'hote sauce, viz.: butter
beaten up with chopped parsley, salt and pepper, and a little lemon
juice. Put a small piece in the hollow of each kidney and serve
hot.--_Mrs. P._


BEEF'S LIVER.

Skin the liver, cut in slices and lay in salt water, as soon as it
comes from market. Fry in lard with pepper, very brown. Season to
taste.--_Mrs. C._


TO FRY LIVER.

The slices must be cut thin, as they require some time to fry; brown
both sides; when taken up, add butter and salt to taste. Fry in hot
lard.--_Mrs. P. W._


BEEF LIVER WITH ONIONS.

Slice the liver rather thin, and throw into salt and water. Meantime
slice the onions and put into a deep frying-pan, just covered with
water, and boil until done, keeping it closely covered. When the water
has all boiled away, put in a heaping spoonful of sweet lard, and fry
until the onions are a light brown. Take them up in a deep plate; set
them on the back of the stove or range to keep hot, and fry the liver
in the same pan, adding more lard if there is not enough. Season all
with salt and pepper, cutting the liver in slices suitable to help one
person. Make a little mound of fried onions on each piece, grate
pounded cracker on the top, and serve.--_Mrs. S. T._


DRIED LIVER FOR RELISH.

Salt the liver well for four days; hang to smoke and dry. Cut in very
thin slices, and broil in pepper and butter.--_Mrs. W._


FRIED LIVER.

Cut the slices thin, scald them for some minutes, put them in a pan
with hot lard, and fry slowly till browned on both sides; add a little
salt and pepper. Take up the liver, and pour into the pan half a
teacup of water; let it boil a few minutes; put the liver back, stir
it up, and cover it up for a short time to keep it from being hard.

Kidneys can be cooked the same way, excepting you must add some
butter, as they are very dry.--_Mrs. P. W._


TO STEW BRAINS.

Have them thoroughly soaked in salt water to get the blood out. Put
them in a stewpan with water enough to cover them; boil half an hour,
pour off the water, and add one teacup of cream or milk, salt, pepper,
and butter the size of an egg. Boil well together for ten minutes,
when put into the dish. Add one tablespoonful vinegar.--_Mrs. P. W._


TO DRESS BRAINS.

Lay in salt and water, then either scramble like eggs, or beat the
yolks of eggs with a little flour; dip the brains in and fry
them.--_Mrs. W._


TO FRY BEEF BRAINS.

Pour over the brains salt water, let them remain for an hour, changing
the water to draw the blood out, then pour over them some boiling
water and remove the skin. Beat up two eggs, and make a batter with a
little flour, bread crumbs and crackers. Season with pepper and salt.
Fry in hot lard.--_Mrs. P. W._


TO FRY BRAINS.

Soak the brains for several hours in weak salt water to get out the
blood; drain and put them in a saucepan and pour very little boiling
water on; simmer a few minutes. Handle them lightly, and arrange so as
to form round cakes, without breaking. Pepper them and use very little
salt; brains require very little salt. Have ready a beaten egg, and
cover the top of the cakes with it, using a spoon to put it on. Sift
over grated cracker and fry in hot lard; serve the other side the same
way. Keep closely covered while frying.--_Mrs. S. T._


BRAIN CROQUETTES.

Wash the brains of three heads very thoroughly, until they are free
from membraneous matter and perfectly white. Then scramble with three
eggs. When cold, roll into egg-shaped balls, with floured hands; dip
in beaten egg, then in cracker or stale bread crumbs, and fry in
lard.--_Mrs. R. L._


TO PREPARE TRIPE.

Empty the contents of the stomach of a fat beef; put it in boiling
water, one piece at a time, to prevent getting too hot. Scrape with a
sharp knife, then put it in a vessel of cold water with salt; wash
thoroughly, and change the salt water every day for four or five
consecutive days; when perfectly white, boil in a very clean vessel of
salt water. Then put it in vinegar until you wish to use it. Cut it in
pieces of three or four inches square, and fry in egg batter.--_Mrs.
J. H._


TRIPE.

The moment the tripe is taken out, wash it thoroughly in many cold
waters. (If you have quick-lime, sift it over the dark inner coat, and
instantly scrape off the coat.) Cut it in four parts. Have ready
boiling water, dip and scrape until it becomes quite white. Prepare
weak brine with a considerable mixture of meal; let it soak a day.
Continue to shift it every day, and every other day scrape it; this
must be done for a week, and then make nice gruel, in which it must be
well boiled, first tying it up in a cloth. When boiled, take it out of
the cloth, and lay it in a weak brine for a night, after which it may
be put with the feet.--_Mrs. R._


BEEF TRIPE.

Clean the tripe carefully. Soak several days in salt water, then in
clear water, changing several times. Cut in slices, boil perfectly
done, dip in a batter of egg (beaten light), milk and flour, or sift
meal over it. Fry or broil. Season with pepper and salt.


TO FRY TRIPE.

Cut the tripe after it has been boiled, into strips about four inches
wide and six long. Make a batter with two eggs, one teacup of flour
and a little milk. Pepper the tripe and roll it in the batter. Fry in
a pan of hot lard; as soon as one side is done, turn it over on the
other side.--_Mrs. P. W._


GRAVY FOR ROAST BEEF.

When the joint is done to a turn, dish it and place before the fire;
then carefully remove the fat from the dripping-pan, and pour the
gravy into the dish, not over the meat, as is the custom of
inexperienced cooks, who, moreover, ruthlessly drown it with a cupful
of boiling water or highly flavored made-gravy. This is an error, for
there is always a sufficient quantity of natural gravy in good meat to
render the use of foreign sauces superfluous.--_Mrs. P._


BROWN GRAVY.

Take the gravy that drips from the meat; add a little water, one
spoonful butter, a little flour, a little pepper and a little salt.
Stew all together.--_Miss E. P._


BOLOGNA SAUSAGE.

Take ten pounds of beef, and four pounds pork, two-thirds lean and
one-third fat; chop very fine and mix well together. Season with six
ounces fine salt, one ounce black pepper, one-half ounce cayenne
pepper, and sage to the taste.--_Mrs. Dr. S._


BEEF SAUSAGE.

Take tough beef and run it through a sausage machine. Form the pulp
into shapes an inch thick, and the size of a common beefsteak. Season
to the taste.--_Mrs. C._


COW HEEL.

As soon as the beef is killed, throw the feet in cold water, and let
them remain during the night. In the morning, put them into a pot of
cold water and let them boil until you find you can easily take off
the hair and the hoof with a knife; take care as the water boils away
to replenish with boiling water. Have ready strong brine, not boiled
nor strong enough to bear an egg, and the moment the feet are
stripped, throw them in. Let them stand one night and in the morning
pour the brine from them and put to them a fresh brine, with a small
quantity of vinegar. In a day or two, they are fit for use.--_Mrs. R._


COW HEEL FRIED.

Buy the feet prepared at the butchers; boil well done. Season with
salt and pepper.

Have ready an egg batter; fry brown, and serve hot. A nice breakfast
dish.--_Mrs. R. L. O._


TO FRY BEEF HEEL.

Have a batter made of eggs, flour, etc., as for tripe. Split the feet
into convenient shapes and fry in hot lard. Pour some vinegar over
them while frying.--_Mrs. P. W._


DAUBE FROIDE.

Take a beef shin, chop in several places to break the bone, keep it
cooking in just water enough to prevent burning, till it falls to
pieces.

Then after taking out the bones, season with one heaping teaspoonful
flour rubbed into one tablespoonful butter, red and black pepper, salt
and celery seed.

Stew it long enough to cook the flour. Pour into a deep dish, cover
with a plate, and put weights on it to press it. Eat cold, as
souse.--_Mrs. C. M. A._


A FRENCH DISH.

To two beef feet, put four gallons water; set on the fire at eight
o'clock in the morning. When the bones have dropped off add the half
of one large onion, two red peppers, and one sprig parsley, all
chopped fine.

Take another pot, put in two gallons water, in which cut up one-half
gallon nice pieces of beef, half an onion, one red pepper, parsley,
all chopped fine, and salt. When all has boiled to pieces, put all
together and let it boil half an hour. Press as souse cheese.--_Mrs.
T._


BRINE FOR BEEF.

     9 quarts salt.
     18 gallons water.
     2 pounds brown sugar.
     1/2 pound saltpetre.

Boil and skim well. Let the beef get thoroughly cold, and let as much
as possible of the blood be drained out before putting it in the
brine. It may sometimes be necessary, in the course of a few months,
that the brine be boiled and skimmed a second time.

This quantity will suffice for about half of an ordinary sized
beef.--_Mrs. A. C._


TO CORN BEEF.

For every hundred pounds of beef, take:

     6 pounds salt.
     2 pounds brown sugar.
     2 ounces saltpetre.
     3 or 4 ounces soda.
     1 ounce red pepper.

The whole to be dissolved in four gallons of water. The beef must be
closely packed in a barrel, and the mixture poured over so as to cover
it. Let it stand a week or ten days, or longer if the weather is cold;
then pour off the brine, boil it, and skim off the blood. Let it cool,
and pour back on the beef. Warranted to keep.--_Mrs. Dr. S._


TO CORN BEEF TONGUES AND BEEF.

One tablespoonful saltpetre to each tongue or piece of beef; rub this
in first, then a plenty of salt. Pack down in salt; after it has
remained ten or twelve days, put this, with a few pods of red pepper
cut up fine, in a brine of only salt and water, which has been boiled,
strained, and cooled, and strong enough to bear an egg. Wash a rock
clean and place on the beef or tongues, to keep them under the brine.
This will keep an indefinite length of time. Fit for use in two
weeks.--_Mrs. S. T._


TO CORN BEEF OR PORK.

     50 pounds meat.
     41/2 pounds salt.
     11/2 pounds brown sugar.
     1/2 pound saltpetre.
     1 quart molasses.

Mix well, boil and skim. When milk-warm, pour it over the meat with a
ladle. The beef must be soaked in clear water and wiped dry, before
putting in the brine. It will be ready for use in a few weeks. Should
the brine mould, skim and boil again. Keep the meat under the
brine.--_Mrs. P. W._


TO PICKLE TONGUE.

Rub it well with salt and leave it alone four or five hours; pour off
the foul brine; take two ounces saltpetre beaten fine, and rub it all
over the tongue; then mix one-quarter of a pound brown sugar and one
ounce sal-prunella (the bay salt and sal prunella beat very fine), and
rub it well over the tongue. Let it lie in the pickle three or four
days; make a brine of one gallon water with common salt strong enough
to bear an egg, a half-pound brown sugar, two ounces saltpetre, and
one-quarter of a pound bay salt. Boil one quarter of an hour, skimming
well; when cold put in the tongue; let it lie in the pickle fourteen
days, turning it every day. When ready to use take it out of the
pickle, or hang it in wood smoke to dry.--_Mrs. A. M. D._


TO CORN BEEF.

One tablespoonful saltpetre to each piece of beef, well rubbed in.
Then rub in as much salt as it will take. Let it stand ten or twelve
days, and then put it in strong brine. Will be ready for use in a
week.--_Mrs. Col. A. F._


CORNED BEEF.

Having a quarter of beef cut into proper size and shape for nice
roasting pieces, put it in a barrel of weak brine and let it remain
four days. Then make a brine that will bear an egg, to which add:

     1/2 pound saltpetre.
     3 pounds brown sugar.

Transfer the beef to this barrel, cover closely, and let it remain a
week. Put a weight on the meat to insure its being kept under the
brine. Beef thus prepared in January will keep well through the month
of March, improving with the lapse of time. It is best served cold. A
valuable receipt for country housekeepers.--_Mrs. Wm. A. S._


HUNTER'S BEEF, OR SPICED ROUND.

To a round of beef weighing twenty-four pounds, take:

     3 ounces saltpetre.
     3 ounces coarsest sugar.
     1 ounce cloves.
     1 nutmeg.
     1/2 ounce allspice.
     3 handfuls salt.

Beat all into the finest powder; allow the beef to hang three or four
days; remove the bone, then rub the spices well into it, continuing to
do so every two or three days, for two or three weeks.

When to be dressed, dip it in cold water, to take off the loose
spices, bind it up tightly and put into a pan with a teacupful water
at the bottom. Sprinkle the top of the meat with suet, cover it over
with a thick batter, and brown paper over it. Bake five hours.--_Mrs.
T. C._


HUNTER'S ROUND, OR SPICED BEEF.

To a round of beef that weighs twenty-five pounds, take the following:

     3 ounces saltpetre.
     1 ounce cloves.
     1 ounce nutmeg.
     1 ounce allspice.
     1 pint salt.

Let the round of beef hang in a cool, dry place twenty-four hours.
Take out the bone, and fill the space with suet and spices mixed. Rub
the above ingredients all over the _round_; put in a wooden box or
tub, turn it over occasionally and rub a small quantity of salt on it.
Let it remain three weeks. Then make a stiff paste of flour and water,
cover the _round_ with it and set in the oven. Bake three hours
slowly. Remove the paste when cold, and trim neatly the rough outside,
and slice horizontally. Served only when cold.--_Mrs. W. A. S._


TO SPICE A ROUND OF BEEF.

Take three tablespoonfuls saltpetre, four tablespoonfuls brown sugar,
with which rub your beef well. Two teacups of salt, one teacup of
cloves, one teacup of allspice (the spice must be ground fine). Rub
the beef with these ingredients. Put it into a tub as near the size of
the beef as possible; turn it every day in the pickle it makes. In
about four weeks it will be ready for use. For thirty pounds use two
pounds beef suet. When cooked place sticks across the bottom of the
pot to prevent its burning.--_Mrs. R. L. P._


SPICED BEEF.

Take eight or ten pounds of the thin flank, remove any gristle, skin
or bones; rub it over with half ounce saltpetre, half ounce bay salt,
then rub it well in with a mixture of spices, the the following
proportions being used:

     1 ounce black pepper.
     1 ounce allspice.
     1/2 ounce ground ginger.
     1/4 ounce cloves.
     1/8 ounce mace.

Use only as much as will suffice to rub the beef all over; then add
three ounces common salt, and quarter of a pound coarse sugar.

Let the beef remain a fortnight in this pickle, turning it and rubbing
it every day: then take it out, cover it with the spices and chopped
sweet herbs, roll it very tight, tie it with tape, put it into a pan
with half-pint water, and half-pound suet.

Bake it after the bread has been drawn, for six hours; put a heavy
weight upon it, and when cold take off the tape.


TO COOK A CORNED ROUND OF BEEF.

Wash it clean of the brine, sew it in a coarse towel and boil six to
eight hours. Do not remove the towel until next day; it is nicer to
put it in a round mould and gives it a good shape. When perfectly
cold, trim nicely and cut it across the grain.--_Mrs. P. W._


TO COOK CORNED BEEF-TONGUE, ETC.

If the beef has been in brine long or has been dried, it must be
soaked in cold water twelve hours before boiling. If freshly cured it
is unnecessary. The beef should be put on in a large pot of water
early in the morning and simmer for hours. Set the pot at the back of
the range or stove, where it will gently boil during the preparation
of dinner. When it first commences to boil, take off the scum. After
it is thoroughly done, take off the boiler or pot. Set away with the
beef under the liquor to remain until next day, when it will be found
juicy and tender. With a sharp knife carefully trim, and garnish with
scraped horseradish and curled parsley.--_Mrs. S. T._


HOW TO COOK CORNED BEEF.

The flank is a nice piece to corn; though an ugly piece of meat, it
can be made a nice and delicious dish. Wash the flank clean, roll it
up as tight as you can, and tie it with strong cord in three places;
then sew it up in a coarse towel and put it on and boil from five to
six hours, according to size; take it out of the pot, but do not undo
it, put it on a dish or pan and put a weight on it; let it stand until
next day, then remove the cloth and strings; trim it, and you have a
nice dish.--_Mrs. P. W._


SMOKED BEEF.

To a piece of beef weighing about twelve or fourteen pounds, you rub
in the following:

     1 pint salt.
     1 cup brown sugar.
     1 cup molasses.
     1/2 teaspoonful pounded saltpetre.

Rub this well on the beef and turn it several times. At the end of ten
days drain it, rub bran on it, hang it up and smoke for several
days.--_Mrs. H. T._


TO CURE BEEF FOR DRYING.

This recipe keeps the meat moist, so that it has none of that
toughness dried beef mostly has when a little old. To every
twenty-eight or thirty pounds, allow one tablespoonful saltpetre, one
quart fine salt, mixed with molasses until the color is about that of
light brown sugar; rub the pieces of meat with the mixture, and when
done, let all stick to it that will. Pack in a keg or half-barrel,
that the pickle may cover the meat, and let it remain forty-eight
hours; at the end of that time, enough pickle will be formed to cover
it. Take it out and hang in a suitable place for drying. Allow all
the mixture to adhere to the meat that will.--_Mrs. A. M. D._


TO CURE BEEF HAM.

Divide the ham into three parts; rub on half-pint molasses; let it
remain in this molasses a day and two nights, turning it over
occasionally during the time. Rub on then one handful salt and put it
back in the vessel with the molasses; turn it over, morning and night
for ten days. Hang it up to dry for one week, then smoke a little. It
is an excellent plan, after sufficiently smoked, to put each piece of
beef in a bag, to protect from insects, and keep hanging till
used.--_Miss K. W._


TO DRY BEEF AND TONGUE.

The best pieces are the brisket, the round and rib pieces that are
used for roasting. Put about the middle of February in brine. Rub
first with salt, and let them lie for a fortnight, then throw them in
brine and let them lay there three weeks, take them out and wipe dry:
rub them over with bran and hang in a cool place and dark, not letting
them touch anything. Should there come a wet season, put them in the
sun to dry a little.--_Mrs. R._


STEWED LOIN OF VEAL.

Take part of a loin of veal, the chump end will do. Put it into a
large, thick, well-tinned iron saucepan, or into a stew-pan, add about
two ounces of butter, and shake it over a moderate fire until it
begins to brown; flour the veal well over, lay it in a saucepan, and
when it is of a fine, equal light brown, pour gradually in veal broth,
gravy or boiling water, to nearly half its depth; add a little salt,
one or two sliced carrots, a small onion, or more when the flavor is
liked, and one bunch parsley.

Stew the veal very softly for an hour or rather more, then turn it and
let it stew for nearly or quite another hour or longer, should it not
appear perfectly done. A longer time must be allowed when the meat is
more than middling size. Dish the joint; skim all the fat from the
gravy and strain it over the meat, or keep the joint hot while it is
rapidly reduced to a richer consistency.--_Mrs. J._


VEAL CHOPS.

First beat until tender, then lay the chops in a pan, pour in just
enough boiling water to barely cover them. Cover closely and simmer
till tender, sprinkling over after they are nearly done, with a little
pepper and salt. Lift from the pan, dry with a clean towel, butter
them, then cover with beaten egg, and sift on cracker crumbs. Lay on a
baking dish or pan and set in the stove to brown. Garnish and
serve.--_Mrs. S. T._


ROAST VEAL.

Plunge into boiling water, dry with a clean cloth; rub well with
pepper and salt, then with butter. Dredge with flour, and put into a
pan with two teacups of boiling water, a slice of bacon or pork,
minced onion and parsley, pepper and salt. Set in a hot oven; simmer,
baste and brown. Veal is longer cooking than lamb. When a light brown,
with a pin, stick on a buttered paper to prevent dryness. Thicken the
gravy with brown flour, if brown gravy is wanted, but always with
mashed Irish potato if white gravy is desired.--_Mrs. S. T._


VEAL STEAK.

First beat until it is tender, then without washing lay on a gridiron
over coals; turn over it a tin plate to prevent hardness and dryness.
Turn the steak, and when well done, with a knife and fork press it and
turn it in a pan or plate of hot melted butter. After putting in plate
of hot butter and letting it absorb as much of the butter as possible,
lay it on a dish, pepper and salt it plentifully, and pour over the
melted butter. (Set in the oven a few minutes, but not long enough for
the butter to fry, which is ruinous to the flavor of steaks, game,
etc.) When done, sift over grated cracker. Garnish with parsley and
serve hot.--_Mrs. S. T._


VEAL CUTLET.

Cut the veal as if for steak or frying, put lard or butter in the pan,
and let it be hot. Beat up an egg on a plate and have flour on
another; dip the pieces first in the egg, then in the flour, on both
sides, and lay in the pan and fry until done, turning it carefully
once. This makes an excellent dish if well prepared. This way is
superior to batter.--_Mrs. D._


_Veal Cutlet._

Cut it in pieces the size of your hand, and lay in salt water some
little time. Take out and wipe dry. Put a small piece of lard in the
pan and sprinkle the cutlet with a very little flour, pepper, and
salt. Fry until nearly done. When it begins to brown, pour off the
lard, and pour in a little water, one large spoonful butter, and a
little celery-seed. Turn it over frequently.--_Mrs. W._


_Veal Cutlets._

Trim smoothly and beat till tender, sprinkle over pepper and salt;
then with a spoon spread over an egg beaten till thick, and cover
thickly with pounded cracker.

Have some hot lard ready in the frying-pan, put the cutlets on to fry,
with the prepared side down; when of a light yellow brown, dress the
other side the same way and fry, keeping closely covered. When they
are perfectly done (veal should never be rare), place in a hot dish;
pour one teacup of milk, one small piece of butter, pepper, salt, and
minced onion and parsley into the pan, stirring constantly. When it
boils up, pour into the dish and garnish with parsley. Always sift
browned cracker over such dishes.--_Mrs. S. T._


COLD VEAL DRESSED WITH WHITE SAUCE.

Boil one pint milk and thicken it a little with one teaspoonful flour,
wet with cold water. When well boiled, put in very thin slices of
veal, and simmer slowly for fifteen minutes.

Have the yolk of an egg well beaten up, and add to the meat, also a
piece of butter.

Let it boil up once, stirring all the time, and serve it on toasted
slices of bread. A few slices of bacon, cut thin and fried to a crisp,
make a good relish with this dish.--_Mrs. G. P._


MINCED VEAL.

Cut some slices of cold veal into small bits or dice; take the cold
gravy and add to it a half-pint of boiling water, one teaspoonful
tomato or walnut catsup, the grated peel of one lemon, pepper and
salt.

Simmer it with the meat slowly for half an hour; then add half a
teaspoonful flour made into a thin batter and pour it into the gravy,
stirring it rapidly. Boil for ten minutes; turn in one-half cupful
cream, or same quantity of milk with a small piece of butter; let it
boil up. Serve on a hot platter garnished with sippets of fried
bread.--_Mrs. P._


VEAL LOAF.

     2 pounds chopped veal.
     1/2 pound chopped pork.
     3 tablespoonfuls powdered cracker.
     1 tablespoonful sage.
     2 tablespoonfuls butter.
     1 teaspoonful black pepper.
     1 teaspoonful mace.
     Salt to taste.
     1 egg well beaten and mixed in the ingredients.

Make up into a loaf or pone, and bake slowly three and a half hours.
This is an excellent dish to use with lettuce, etc., in the spring or
early autumn, when game is out of season. It is best to be made the
day before using.--_Mrs. R. R._


VEAL LOAF.

Two and a half pounds meat taken from fillet or shoulder, or wherever
the meat is free from fat. Take out all the little white, fibrous or
sinewy particles, and chop very finely, almost to a paste. Mix in
rolled cracker crumbs with one egg to hold it together, a little
butter, red and black pepper, and salt to taste.

Form into a small loaf; dredge with the cracker crumbs, and put
several little pieces of butter over the outside. Set this loaf
uncooked, with about one quart water or some broth, in a pan; put it
in the oven and baste constantly for two hours, and when taken out to
cool, pour any remaining liquid over the loaf. It ought to cut in
slices and be quite compact--no caverns in the inside of the
loaf.--_Mrs. G. P._


VEAL CAKE.

Take one and a half pounds veal, and half a pound of bacon, stew
together with very little water, a little salt and pepper, thyme and
parsley.

When the veal is tender, cut into small square pieces, as also the
bacon.

Boil four eggs hard and slice them up, and chop some raw parsley fine.

Take a mould or small bowl, lay the slices of egg in a kind of pattern
prettily at the bottom of it. Sprinkle the parsley between the slices.
Add veal, bacon, and more egg alternately, pepper and salt to taste,
and a little grated lemon-peel, also some more parsley, and so on
until the bowl is nearly full. Fill up with the gravy the veal was
boiled in, which ought to be very rich. Let it stand until quite cold,
then turn out on a flat dish. The slices cut firmer and more solid
when the cake is made the day beforehand, which it is best to do if
the weather permits.--_Mrs. R. P._


SWEETBREADS.

Three good throat sweetbreads will make a dish. Blanch them well and
lay in cold water, then take out and dry well. Add egg, bread crumbs,
and herbs.

Put on a dish and brown in an oven. Eat with mushroom or tomato
sauce.--_Mrs. R._


_Sweetbreads._

Soak, and put in boiling water for ten minutes.

Stew in cold water to blanch them.

They may be cut in slices or in dice and put in fricassee or meats, or
ragouts, or used as a separate dish.--_Mrs. W._


_Sweetbreads._

Lay them in salt and water, after washing; parboil until done; drain,
dry, and split in half. Rub with butter, pepper and salt. Dip in one
egg beaten stiff. Sift over pounded cracker.

Butter a baking-dish, lay them in, and set in a hot oven to brown, or
fry until a light brown.--_Mrs. S. T._


CALVES' FEET DRESSED AS TERRAPINS.

Boil eight feet until the meat leaves the bones, then remove them. Put
them in a pan with one-half pint of the rich gravy in which they are
boiled, and add two large spoonfuls butter.

Rub the yolks of three hard-boiled eggs with a small teaspoonful
mustard, a very little cayenne, and salt to the taste.

When well mixed with the egg, stir all together into the feet or
gravy. Let it simmer ten minutes, and just before dishing add two
wineglasses of good cooking wine and simmer again before
serving.--_Mrs. M. E. L. W._


CALF'S LIVER BROILED.

Cut the liver in thin slices, wash it and let it stand in salt and
water half an hour to draw out the blood. Parboil in fresh salt and
water, and broil, basting frequently in butter. Lay on a hot dish with
a lump of butter.--_Mrs. A. M. D._


TO FRY CALF'S LIVER.

Cut in thin slices. Season with pepper and salt, sweet herbs, and
parsley.

Dredge with flour and fry brown with lard. Have it thoroughly done,
but it must not be hard; keep covered while frying.--_Mrs. R._


CALF'S LIVER FRIED.

A calf's liver, as white as can be procured, flour, one bunch savory
herbs, including parsley, juice of a lemon; pepper and salt to taste,
a little water.

Cut the liver into slices of a good and equal shape. Dip them in flour
and fry brown. Place on a hot dish and keep before the fire while you
prepare the gravy. Mince the herbs fine and put into the frying-pan
with a little more butter; add the other ingredients with one
teaspoonful flour. Simmer gently until the herbs are done, and pour
over the liver.--_Mrs. A. M. D._


BEWITCHED LIVER.

     3   pounds calf's liver, chopped fine.
     1/4 pound salt pork.
     1   cup grated bread crumbs.
     2   eggs well beaten.
     2   teaspoonfuls salt.
     2   teaspoonfuls black pepper.
     1/2 teaspoonful red pepper.

Mix all well together, and put into a tin mould; set it in a pot of
cold water and let it boil two hours. Then set the mould in a cool
oven to dry off a little; when thoroughly cold turn it out.--_Mrs. J.
H._


SIMPLE WAY OF COOKING LIVER.

Wash calf's liver and heart thoroughly; chop them fine as possible,
after they have been boiled till very tender; then add pepper and
salt, and one tablespoonful flour, straining into it a little of the
water.--_Mrs. J. P. H._


CALF'S BRAINS.

Beat up the brains with a little lemon-peel cut fine, a little nutmeg
grated, a little mace beaten, thyme and parsley.

Shred fine the yolk of an egg, and dredge with flour. Fry in little
flat cakes and lay on top of the baked head.

If for soup, mix in one-half the brains with the soup while the soup
is boiling, and make the other in cakes and lay together with
forcemeat balls in the soup.--_Mrs. R._


CALF'S HEAD.

Split the head, take out the brains, boil till it will fall to pieces.
Cut it up fine and season with pepper, salt and nutmeg to the taste;
add one-quarter pound of butter, wineglassful wine, and the brains,
which are not to be boiled with the head. Put in a dish and bake with
or without paste.--_Mrs. J. D._


BAKED CALF'S HEAD.

Boil until tender, then cut into pieces and put into a deep dish with
pepper, salt, a few cloves, mace, a little thyme.

A spoonful butter with flour, well mixed through the meat, a layer of
bread crumbs on top. Then add a wineglass of wine and fill up the dish
with the water the head was boiled in, and bake three-quarters of an
hour. Garnish with forcemeat balls and rings of hard-boiled eggs, just
before sending to the table.--_Miss N._


VEAL DAUBE.

After the head of a calf is skinned and the feet prepared by taking
off the hoofs, scraping, etc., throw them into cold water for
twenty-four hours. Put them in a boiler of cold water, and simmer
until the flesh leaves the bones and there is but little water left.

Throw in salt, pepper, minced onion, parsley, and thyme; take the meat
and bones out. Beat up two eggs until light, add two tablespoonfuls
cold water, then the liquor from the boiler. Stir all together, boil
up and strain on the meat from the head, which must first be cut up or
picked fine and chopped with six hard-boiled eggs, and seasoned to the
taste with the juice of one lemon and wineglass of jelly. This is set
aside in a mould or bowl and eaten cold with garnish of scraped
horseradish and parsley. The calves' feet make another good dish by
drying first, then dipping in batter made of an egg, one spoonful of
flour, one small teacupful milk, with a little salt, and
frying.--_Mrs. S. T._




MUTTON AND LAMB.


When the weather will admit of it, mutton is better for being kept a
few days before cooking. The saddle, which is considered the finest
piece, consists of the back or loin and upper part of the hind legs.
In getting this nice roast, however, you spoil the hind quarter, as
the saddle takes some of the nicest parts of this and leaves it too
dry to cook by itself. The hind quarter and loin together make a very
nice dish--the latter being fat and juicy.

The fore quarter is sometimes cut by taking off the shoulder and
taking the rib-piece, making a piece called the brisket or breast, and
many persons esteem this the choicest part of the mutton. The ribs cut
next to the back are used for mutton chops.

When you have a large supply of mutton on hand, it is well to put the
hind quarters in brine, as you can thus corn them as nicely as beef.
As mutton spoils easily, this plan is very advisable.

Whilst boiled mutton is very nice, lamb is spoiled by this mode of
cooking. If lamb is to be roasted, it should be covered with the caul,
as the fat, dripping from this, will preserve the moisture of the
meat.

In carving the fore quarter of lamb, first take off the shoulder and
then cut the ribs in strips.

Lamb is seldom cut except in quarters, and when nicely cooked there is
nothing better. It should be four months old before being eaten. The
season for lamb is from May to August, whilst that for mutton is from
August to Christmas.


TO ROAST MUTTON.

The hind quarter is the nicest part of the mutton to roast, and
requires longer to cook than lamb. Put it in a pot of boiling water
and let it simmer one hour. Lift it into a baking-pan, rub with salt
and pepper (too much salt makes the meat tough). Rub over it a little
lard and then dredge with flour: skim off the top of the water and
pour over it. Set it in a hot oven, basting frequently to prevent it
from being hard and dry; roast till thoroughly done. This is nice to
set aside for a cold dish, garnished with horseradish and eaten with
currant jelly.--_Mrs. P. W._


ROAST LEG OF MUTTON.

Choose young and tender mutton. Take off the shank--wash it well; let
it lie fifteen or twenty minutes in salt water to take the blood out.
Rub with little salt and pepper well. Lay on a grate, which will go
nicely in a baking-pan, over one pint boiling water; break the bones
of the shank in the water, adding more pepper and salt. Set it in a
very hot oven, and baste frequently to prevent it from being hard and
dry. When it is of a light brown, cover with sheets of buttered paper.
Place it on a dish; add minced parsley to the gravy, which should be
brown. Cover the roast with grated brown cracker and garnish at
intervals with chopped parsley; pour the gravy in the dish, not over
it. Mutton should always be perfectly done.--_Mrs. S. T._


ROAST SADDLE OF MUTTON.

Trim the joint carefully, roast it at a brisk, clear fire; baste
frequently, and when done dredge it plentifully with salt, and serve
with the gravy well freed from fat.


TO BOIL A LEG OF MUTTON.

Make a paste of flour quite plain, mixed stiff with water, roll out as
for a meat pudding; break and turn in the shank bone; then cover the
leg of mutton carefully with the paste; tie up tight in a well-floured
cloth. Have ready sufficient boiling water, place in the joint, allow
ten minutes for checking the boiling, and twenty minutes for each
pound of meat. Carefully remove the paste, which can be done by one
cut longitudinally and one cut across. Strain the gravy and serve as
usual.


BOILED LEG OF MUTTON.

Dip a cloth in hot water, tie up the mutton and put in boiling water.
Boil slowly for two hours, or longer, if not kept constantly
boiling.--_Mrs. R._


BROILED MUTTON.

After a leg of mutton has been washed and wiped dry, place in a cloth
that has been dipped in boiling water. Roll it up, pin and tie
securely; put in a pot of boiling water. Let it simmer several hours,
removing the scum that rises when it first begins to boil. If a small
leg of mutton, it will require a shorter time to cook than a large
one. Just before it is done, add enough salt to season it properly,
half an onion, and one heaping teaspoonful of black pepper. When this
has properly seasoned the meat, take from the fire, unwrap and drain.
Serve with drawn butter, adding capers or nasturtium seed, or if you
have neither, use chopped sour pickle instead. Mutton should always
be served with caper sauce, if possible.--_Mrs. S. T._


TO COOK A SADDLE OF MUTTON.

Meats are all better for being kept a day or two before cooking,
particularly mutton. If the mutton be tender, do not boil it, but put
it in a pan of water, set it on the stove, and cook slowly, basting
constantly with the gravy or water in the pan; with pepper and salt to
taste. Just before it is done, put some scraped horseradish over it,
and garnish the dish with the same; add a little ground mustard and
grated bread or cracker; pour the gravy over it, and grate bread over,
and set aside to cool. This is for cold mutton. All meats are better
for roasting before a fire than in a stove.--_Mrs. P. W._


SADDLE OF MUTTON.

This should be covered with paper, and carefully roasted or baked.
Season with a little pepper and salt; garnish with horseradish.


ICED SADDLE OF MUTTON.

Reserve the drippings from the meat when it is roasting. After the
saddle is nicely cooked, let it get cold. Then take the white part of
the gravy and melt it to the consistency of cream. Pour this over the
saddle until it is covered with a white coat; if it appears rough,
warm an iron spoon and pass over it until it is smooth. Place it on a
dish, and dress the dish all round with vegetable flowers and curled
parsley, using the parsley to ornament the saddle also.--_Mrs. Judge
S._


TO CORN MUTTON.

Mutton being less apt to keep than other meat, it is well, when you
have an over-supply, to corn it exactly as you would corn beef.--_Miss
R. S._


SHOULDER OF MUTTON CORNED.

Take a small shoulder of mutton, rub it with

     2 ounces salt.
     2 ounces sugar.
     1/2 ounce saltpetre.

After twenty-four hours, rub it again with the pickle; next day boil
this in paste like the leg of mutton. Serve smothered in onion sauce.


MUTTON CHOP.

Get from your butcher nicely shaped mutton chops, not too long. Put
them into a pan with pepper and salt, and barely enough water to cover
them.

Cover close and simmer till done; drain, wipe dry; pepper, salt and
butter them; with a spoon, cover with an egg beaten stiff. Sift over
pounded crackers. Put in a pan and set in an oven to brown.--_Mrs. S.
T._


MUTTON CHOPS DRESSED WITH TOMATOES.

Place in a pan tomatoes peeled and chopped; season with butter,
pepper, sugar, and salt.

Take from your gridiron some nicely broiled mutton chops; put into a
pan, cover close, and simmer for fifteen minutes. Lay the chops on a
hot dish, put on a little butter, pepper and salt.

With a spoon, cover each chop with tomatoes. Sift over pounded cracker
and serve.--_Mrs. S. T._


MUTTON CHOP.

Cut the steaks; pepper and salt them. Broil them lightly on both
sides; take them off the gridiron, lay them on a spider. Slice up one
large onion and stew until it becomes tender; put a layer between each
chop and stew until they become tender. Take out the steaks, cover
them closely or tilt the gravy to the side of the vessel, till it is
brown; stir in a lump of butter.--_Mrs. A. P._


_Mutton Chop._

Mushroom catsup is a nice flavoring. Put pepper and salt on the chops
and lay them in melted butter; when they have imbibed sufficient, take
out and cover with grated bread crumbs and broil.--_Mrs. R._


BROILED MUTTON CHOPS.

Beat the mutton chops till tender; then trim, making them of uniform
size and shape; pour on them boiling water. Let them remain in it a
minute, dry them and rub with pepper, salt, and fresh butter. Lay on a
gridiron over hot coals, always remembering to cover them while
broiling. Turn them, and as soon as nicely browned place in a hot
dish, pepper again, pour over them melted butter, and serve.--_Mrs. S.
T._


MUTTON STEW.

Cut slices of rare mutton and put on to stew in a little water; when
nearly done put in--

     1 teacup of sweet pickle vinegar.
     3 large spoonfuls jelly.
     A little salt.
     1 teaspoonful mustard.
     1/2 teacup of walnut catsup.
     Butter size of an egg.

Stew slowly a short time.--_Mrs. F. D._


_Mutton Stew._

Slice cold mutton or lamb, lay it in a baking dish; put in--

     1 teaspoonful black pepper.
     1 teaspoonful red pepper.
     1 teaspoonful celery-seed, pounded.
     Rather more than 1 teaspoonful each of pounded cloves, cinnamon
       and mace.
     1 teacup of yellow pickle vinegar.
     1 glassful wine.

Slice up a little yellow pickled cucumber, sugar to taste, one-quarter
pound butter, one roll of light bread broken in small pieces or cut in
little slices, and toasted before used.

In preparing this dish put a layer of the meat and seasonings
alternately.

The peppers, celery-seed, cloves, cinnamon, and mace must all be
pounded fine.--_Mrs. C._


GRILLED SLICES OF MUTTON.

Cut some rather thick slices of underdone cold mutton, score them well
and rub in plentifully some common mustard, salt, and cayenne pepper;
then broil them over a clear fire, and serve with onion sauce.


SHEEP'S TONGUES.

Boil them till the skin can be taken off; split them, and put them
into a stew-pan, with some gravy, parsley, mushrooms, and one minced
shallot, and some butter, some pepper, and salt.

Stew till tender, and strain the gravy over them; or they may be
glazed and served with the gravy under them. Sheep's tongues may also
be skinned, larded, braised, and glazed; and served with onion sauce.


TO ROAST LAMB.

The hind quarter is the nicest piece for roasting. Drop it in a pot of
boiling water; boil half an hour, put it in a pan, dredge it with
lard, pepper, flour, a little salt; skim the top of the water in which
it is boiled, and pour over it; as soon as the gravy accumulates in
the pan keep it basted frequently to prevent it from being hard and
dry. Lamb should be cooked done to be good.--_Mrs. P. W._


TO GRILL A SHOULDER OF LAMB.

Half boil it, score and cover it with egg, crumbs, and parsley
seasoned as for cutlets. Broil it over a very clear, slow fire, or
put it in a Dutch oven to brown it; serve with any sauce that is
liked. A breast of lamb is often grilled in the same way.


LAMB'S HEAD TO FRICASSEE.

Parboil the head and haslet (the liver excepted); cut the meat in
slices from the head; slice the heart, tongue, etc., and fricassee as
for chicken. Have the liver fried in slices with the sweetbreads and
slices of bacon and bunches of parsley. Pour the fricassee into the
dish, and garnish with the fried pieces.--_Mrs. R._


LAMB'S HEAD.

Boil the head and liver, but so as not to let the liver be too much
done. Take up the head, split it through the bone, which must remain
with the meat on. Cut the meat across and across with a knife, grate
some nutmeg on it and lay it on a dish before a good fire; then throw
over it some grated bread crumbs, some sweet herbs, some allspice, a
little lemon peel chopped fine, a very little pepper and salt. Baste
it with butter, and dredge a little flour over it.

Just as it is done, take one-half the liver, the lights, the meat, the
tongue; chop them small with six or eight spoonfuls water or gravy.
First shake some flour over the meat and stew it together; then put in
the gravy or water, a good piece of butter rolled in a little flour,
pepper and salt, and what runs from the head in the dish. Simmer all
together a few minutes, and add half a spoonful of vinegar; pour it on
the head. Lay the head on the centre of the mince-meat; have ready the
other half of liver, cut in pieces and fried quickly with slices of
bacon and lemon; lay these around the dish and serve.--_Mrs. T._


DECORATIONS AND GARNISHES FOR COLD MEATS AND SALADS.

The day before giving a dinner or evening entertainment, gather up
medium and small sized pure white and yellow turnips, carrots, red and
pink beets, the different colored radishes. From these the most
beautiful flowers can be cut; camellias, roses, dahlias, tulips,
tuberoses, etc. No explicit directions can be given except, first,
smoothly to pare each vegetable, taking care not to keep them too near
the fire, which will cause them to wilt and lose the waxy freshness
which makes them so beautiful. Each flower may be laid on a cluster of
green leaves or curled parsley, and over the cold meats, and around
the edge of the dish.

The cutting of these flowers makes a charming and interesting pastime
for the young members of the family, in the evening before.--_Mrs. C.
G._




POULTRY.


In summer, kill and dress the poultry the day beforehand, except
chicken for frying, which is not good unless killed the same day it is
eaten.

The best way to kill a fowl is to tie it by its legs, hang it up, and
then cut off its neck. In this way, it dies more quickly, suffers
less, and bleeds more freely.

It is best to pick fowls dry; though, if you are pressed for time, you
may facilitate the picking of chickens, as well as of partridges and
other small birds, by putting them first into water, hot, but not
boiling. Then take off the feathers carefully, so as not to break the
skin. Never scald a turkey, duck or goose, however, before picking.

To draw the crop, split the skin of all poultry on the back of the
neck. Pull the neck upward and the skin downward, and the crop can be
easily pulled out. Then cut off the neck close to the body, leaving
the skin to skewer at the back of the neck after the dressing has been
put in. Make an incision under the rump lengthwise, sufficient to
allow the entrails to be easily removed. Be careful not to break the
gall, and to preserve the liver whole. Cut open the gizzard, take out
the inner skin, and wash both carefully. Wash the bird inside several
times, the last time with salt and water. Some persons object to using
water inside or outside, but I consider it more cleanly to wash the
bird first and then wipe it dry with a clean towel. It should then be
hung with the neck downwards till ready to cook.

The head, neck, and feet, after being nicely washed and the bones in
them broken, should be stewed in the gravy, as they make it much
richer.

It is said that throwing chickens into cold water immediately after
they have finished bleeding, and allowing them to remain there ten or
fifteen minutes, will make them deliciously tender, which can be
accounted for scientifically. Frozen fowls or game should be thawed
gradually, by being laid in cold water. If cooked without being
thawed, it will require double time, and they will not be tender nor
high-flavored.

The tests by which you may tell the age of a turkey are these. An old
turkey has rough and red legs, and if a gobbler, long spurs, while
young turkeys have black legs, and if gobblers, small spurs. The
fatter they are and the broader their breasts, the better. When
dressed, the skin should be a yellowish white, and, if tender, you may
easily rip it with a pin. If, when you bend back the wings, the sinews
give and crack, this is another test of the turkey being young, and
the same test will apply to other fowls. The bill and feet of an old
goose are red and hairy. A young goose has pen feathers and its flesh
is whiter than that of an old one.

If young, the lower part of a hen's legs and feet are soft and smooth,
while a young cock has small spurs. When dressed, the flesh should be
white and the fat a pale yellow. Turn the wing back, and if the sinews
snap it is a sign the chicken is young.

A few words on the subject of carving may not be out of place here. A
sharp knife, with a thin and well tempered blade is essential to good
carving. In carving a turkey, cut off first the wing nearest to you,
then the leg and second joint, then slice the breast till a rounded,
ivory-shaped piece appears. Insert the knife between that and the
bone, and separate them. This part is the nicest bit of the breast.
Next comes the merry-thought. After this, turn over the bird a little,
and just below the breast you will find the oyster, which you will
separate as you did the inner breast. The side bone lies beside the
rump, and the desired morsel can be taken out without separating the
whole bone. Proceed with the other side in the same way. The fork need
not be removed during the whole process.

Chicken and partridges are carved in the same way.


ROAST TURKEY.

Wash nicely in and out. Plunge into boiling water ten minutes. Have
ready a dressing of

     Bread crumbs.
     Hard boiled eggs, chopped fine.
     1 tablespoonful butter.
     Minced parsley, thyme and celery.

After rubbing the cavity well with salt and pepper and putting in a
slice of pork or bacon, fill with the above dressing. Do the same also
to the crop, so as to make the turkey look plump. Rub the turkey well
with butter and sprinkle salt and pepper over it. Dredge with flour.
Lay in the pan with a slice of pork or bacon and a pint of boiling
water. Lay the liver and gizzard in the pan with it. Put in a hot
oven, basting and turning frequently till every part is a beautiful
brown. When the meat is amber color, pin a buttered sheet of writing
paper over it to keep it from becoming hard and dry. Cook three or
four hours. Season the gravy with minced parsley and celery and serve
with cranberry sauce.--_Mrs. S. T._


_Roast Turkey._

Wash the turkey thoroughly inside and out, having removed the
insides. Make a dressing of bread soaked in cold water, drained and
mashed fine, a small piece of melted butter or salt pork chopped,
pepper and salt, sweet herbs, a hard boiled egg, chopped fine.

Any kind of cooked meat is good, minced fine and added to the
dressing. The body and crop must be filled with the dressing and sewed
up. The giblets ought to be boiled tender, if they are to be used. Use
the water in which they are boiled, for gravy, adding a little of the
turkey drippings, seasoning with pepper, salt, and sweet herbs, and
thickening with a little flour and water, mixed smoothly. Place where
it will boil.

When the fowl is put on to roast, put a little water into the
dripping-pan. At first it should be roasted slowly and basted
frequently. Tie up the wings and legs before roasting, and rub on a
little butter and salt. Serve with drawn butter.--_Mrs. W._


_Roast Turkey._

Put the gizzard, heart and liver in cold water and boil till tender.
When done, chop fine and add stale bread, grated, salt and pepper,
sweet herbs, if liked, two eggs well beaten.

Fill the turkey with this dressing, sew the openings, drawing the skin
tightly together. Put a little butter over the turkey and lay it upon
the grate of your meat-pan. Cover the bottom of the pan well with
boiling water. In half an hour, baste the turkey by pouring over it
the gravy that has begun to form in the pan. Repeat this basting every
fifteen minutes. In an oven of average temperature, a twelve-pound
turkey will require at least three hours' cooking.--_Mrs. A. D._


ROAST TURKEY, WITH TRUFFLES.

Truffles must be peeled, chopped and pounded in a mortar; one and a
half pound will do for one turkey. Rasp the same amount of fat bacon
and mix with the truffles and stuff the turkey with it. This dressing
is usually placed in the turkey two days beforehand, to impart its
flavor to the fowl. Lay thin slices of fat bacon over the breast of
the turkey, cover it with half a sheet of white paper, and roast two
hours. Chestnuts dressed in the same way as truffles are found an
excellent substitute.--_Mrs. S. G._


BOILED TURKEY.

Wash well with cold water, then put on in milk-warm water, either tied
in a coarse cloth dredged with flour or with a half-pound of rice in
the water. Keep well under water, and boil slowly three hours, adding
salt just before it is done. When perfectly done and tender, take out
of the pot, sprinkle in the cavity a little pepper and salt, and fill
with oysters stewed just enough to plump them, and season, with
butter, pepper, salt and vinegar. Place in a dish and set in a steamer
to keep hot. Strain the liquor in which the oysters were scalded, add
drawn butter, chopped celery, parsley and thyme; pour over the turkey,
and serve. If not convenient to use oysters, use egg and butter sauce.
Garnish with sliced lemons.--_Mrs. S. T._


_Boiled Turkey._

Prepare the turkey as for roasting. Tie it in a cloth or boil rice in
the pot with it, if you wish it to look white. It is improved by
boiling a pound or two of salt pork with it. If soup is made of the
liquor, let it stand till next day and skim the fat. Season after
heating.--_Mrs. W._


TO STEAM A TURKEY.

Rub butter, pepper and salt inside the turkey after it has been well
washed, fill with oysters, sew up, lay in a dish and set in a steamer
placed over boiling water. Cover closely and steam from two hours to
two and a half. Take up, strain the gravy which will be found in the
dish. Have an oyster sauce ready, prepared like stewed oysters, and
pour into it this gravy thickened with a little butter and flour. Let
it come to a boil and whiten with a little boiled cream. Pour this
over the steamed turkey and send to the table hot. Garnish with
sliced lemons.--_Mrs. S. T._


TURKEY HASH.

Cut up the meat very fine. Stew the bones in a little water, then stir
into this water the meat, adding a large tablespoonful butter, a cup
of cream, salt and pepper, a little chopped parsley, thyme or celery
(or else a very few celery-seeds). Stew all together.--_Mrs. R._


DEVILLED TURKEY.

Place the legs and wings (jointed) on a gridiron. Broil slowly. Have
ready a sauce made of--

     1 tablespoonful pepper vinegar.
     1 tablespoonful made mustard.
     1 tablespoonful celery sauce.
     1 tablespoonful acid fruit jelly.
     A little salt and pepper.

Lay the broiled turkey on a hot dish. Pour the dressing and sift
pounded cracker over it.--_Mrs. S. T._


POTATO STUFFING FOR TURKEYS AND OTHER FOWLS.

Mash smoothly six good-sized boiled Irish potatoes. Chop a small onion
very fine and fry a light brown, in a frying-pan, with a
dessertspoonful lard. Then add the potatoes with salt and pepper, and
a lump of butter as large as a walnut. To this add one well beaten
egg, stirring till perfectly dry. If for geese or ducks, add a little
sifted sage and a small quantity of red pepper.--_Mrs. McG._


BONED TURKEY.

The turkey must be full grown, moderately fat, and picked dry. Do not
remove the entrails. Cut off the neck about one inch from the body.
Take off the wings above the second joint and cut off the legs as
usual. With a sharp pointed knife, split the skin from the end of the
neck to the rump. Run the knife between the bones and flesh on one
side, till you come to where the wing and leg join the body. Twist
the wing and raise it, cracking the joint. Separate it from the body.
Then proceed with the leg in the same way, on the same side. Run the
knife between the bones and flesh till you reach the breast bone.
Repeat this on the other side. Take out the craw. Carefully run a
sharp knife under the rump, detaching it from the bone without cutting
the skin, as it must come off with the flesh. Hold the turkey by the
neck and pull the skin carefully down, until the upper part of the
breast bone is uncovered. Cut the flesh from the bone on both sides,
till the end of the bone is nearly reached. The turkey must now be
laid on the back and held by the neck, the front of the turkey being
toward you. Take hold of the skin of the neck with the left hand,
pulling downwards with a knife in the right hand, separate the skin
from the end of the bone. The whole of the turkey is now detached from
the carcass. Lay it on a table with the skin down. Pull the bones from
the wings and legs, first running the knife around so as to leave the
flesh. Pull out all the tendons of the legs. Push them and the wings
inside. Cut off the ring under the rump. All this must be done slowly
and carefully. Have ready a half-dozen slices of salt pork, and a
salad made of shoat, veal or lamb, chopped and seasoned, as turkey
salad, with celery, etc. Mix with this salad three or four large Irish
potatoes, boiled and mashed, with a spoonful of butter. Now lay the
turkey on the table, inside up and the neck from you; pepper and salt
it; lay three or four slices of pork on it, then a layer of the salad;
pork again and salad alternately until filled; draw the two sides
together and sew it up, giving it as near as possible its proper
shape. Sew it up carefully in a cloth, place in a kettle of the proper
shape, cover with boiling water, adding the broken bones, three pounds
fresh lean beef, parsley, thyme, onions and two dozen whole black
peppercorns, with salt to the taste. Simmer three hours, then take it
from the water and remove the towel. Carefully remove all
discolorations and settlings of the water from the turkey. Scald a
clean cloth, wrap it up again; place it on its back, put a dish over
it with a weight on it and set it in a cool place till next day.
Unwrap and remove the twine with which it was sewed. Glaze it with a
little meat jelly; just before the jelly congeals sift over a little
cracker browned and pounded; decorate with meat jelly and serve.
Directions for preparing meat jelly follow.--_Mrs. S. T._


MEAT JELLY FOR BONED TURKEY.

As soon as the water in which the turkey was boiled is cold, take off
all the fat and strain it, put it in a porcelain-lined kettle; two
ounces gelatine, three eggs, with shells, a wine-glass of sherry, port
or madeira wine; stir well. Add one quart of the strained liquor; beat
rapidly with an egg-beater, put it on the fire and stir until it
boils. Simmer ten or fifteen minutes. Sprinkle in a pinch of turmeric
and strain just as any other jelly. When congealed break it up and
place around the turkey. Cut some in thick slices and in fanciful
shapes with paste cutters. Place some of these lozenges over the
turkey and border the edges of the dish with them.--_Mrs. S. T._


CHICKENS.

These, whether for boiling or roasting, should have a dressing
prepared as for turkeys. Six spoonfuls of rice boiled with the
chickens will cause them to look white. If the water is cold when they
are put in, they will be less liable to break. They are improved by
boiling a little salt pork with them. If not thus boiled, they will
need salt.

For broiling, chickens should be split, the innards taken out, and the
chickens then washed. Broil very slowly till done, placing the bony
side down; then turn it and brown the other side. Forty minutes is the
medium time for broiling a chicken.

For roast chicken, boil the gizzard and liver by themselves, and use
the water for gravy.--_Mrs. Col. W._


ROAST CHICKEN.

Chicken should never be cooked the same day it is killed. Wash well
with cold water, then pour boiling water over it and into the cavity.
Rub the latter with salt and pepper, and fill with a dressing made of
bread soaked in water and squeezed out, a tablespoonful butter, a
little salt, pepper and parsley.

Rub the chicken well with butter. Sprinkle pepper and salt over it and
dredge with flour. Lay it into a pan with a slice of pork or bacon and
a pint of water. Let it simmer slowly two hours, basting and dredging
frequently. Turn the chicken so each part may be equally browned. Add
chopped thyme and parsley to the gravy.

Some persons think ground ginger a more delicate flavoring for the
dressing than pepper.--_Mrs. S. T._


TO BOIL CHICKEN.

Never boil the same day the chicken is killed. Soak them overnight in
weak salt and water. Place in a kettle of water, with a handful of
rice and a little milk to make the chicken white. Simmer slowly two or
three hours, removing the scum that rises when the chicken first
begins to boil. Keep under the water, with an inverted deep plate.
Just before taking off the fire, add salt to the taste. Lay on a hot
dish near the fire. Skim off the fat from the top of the liquor,
strain it and add chopped celery, parsley and thyme, drawn butter, a
little pepper and salt, or, if preferred, six hard-boiled eggs chopped
fine.--_Mrs. S. T._


TO STEAM CHICKEN.

Soak two hours, in salt and water, a fat young pullet. Drain and dry.
Rub in the cavity a little salt and pepper and a large lump of butter.
Fill with large, plump oysters, seasoned with pepper and salt, and sew
up. Lay the chicken on a dish or pan, and set it inside a steamer,
which close and keep over boiling water four hours. When thoroughly
done, lay on a dish and pour over it drawn butter or celery sauce.
Garnish with curled parsley, and serve.--_Mrs. S. T._


SMOTHERED CHICKEN.

Kill the day before it is smothered. Split open the back, as if to
broil. When ready to cook, wipe dry with a clean towel, rub well with
butter and sprinkle with pepper and salt. Put in a pan with a slice of
bacon or pork and a pint of water. Simmer an hour or more, basting
frequently. When thoroughly done, place on a hot dish.

Stir into the gravy remaining on the fire a beaten egg, mixing it
carefully. Pour this into the dish, but not on the chicken. Sift over
it cracker, first browned and then pounded. Garnish with parsley, and
serve.--_Mrs. S. T._


STEWED CHICKEN.

Cut up the chicken as if to fry, adding the prepared head and feet.
Soak in weak salt and water. If for dinner, do this immediately after
breakfast.

An hour and a half before dinner, put in a saucepan, covering well
with water. Let it simmer slowly for one hour. Take it out with a fork
and lay in a bowl. Add a teacup milk and half a teaspoonful black
pepper to the liquor. Let it boil up and strain on the chicken. Rinse
the saucepan and return all to the fire. Beat one egg with a
tablespoonful of flour and one of milk until quite smooth. Mince some
parsley, thyme, and a very little onion, and stir all into the
saucepan. Then put in a tablespoonful of butter. Stir around and pour
into a dish in which small pieces of toast have been neatly arranged.
Garnish with curled parsley.--_Mrs. S. T._


_Stewed Chicken._

Cut up and lay in salt and water. Put them in water enough to cover
them, with some slices of middling. Let them boil till nearly done.
Then put in the dumplings, made like biscuit but rolled thin, and let
them boil till done. Roll a piece of butter in flour, with pepper,
salt, chopped parsley and celery, or a little celery-seed. When the
gravy is thick enough, pour in a teacup of cream or milk, and let it
boil up once. Take off the fire and serve hot.--_Mrs. Col. W._


FRIED CHICKEN.

This dish is best when the chicken is killed the same day it is fried.
Cut off the wings and legs, cut the breast in two, and also the back.
Wash well and throw in weak salt and water, to extract the blood. Let
it remain for half an hour or more. Take from the water, drain and dry
with a clean towel, half an hour before dinner. Lay on a dish,
sprinkle a little salt over it, and sift flour thickly first on one
side and then on the other, letting it remain long enough for the
flour to stick well. Have ready on the frying-pan some hot lard, in
which lay each piece carefully, not forgetting the liver and gizzard.
Cover closely and fry till a fine amber color. Then turn over each
piece and cover well again, taking care to have the chicken well done,
yet not scorched. Take the chicken up and lay in a hot dish near the
fire. Pour into the gravy a teacup of milk, a teaspoonful of butter, a
saltspoon of salt, and one of pepper. Let it boil up and pour into the
dish, but not over the chicken. Put curled parsley round the edge of
the dish and serve.--_Mrs. S. T._


_Fried Chicken._

Kill the chicken the night before, if you can, and lay on ice, or else
kill early in the morning. When ready, wipe dry, flour it, add pepper
and salt, and fry in a little lard. When nearly done, pour off the
lard, add one-half teacup water, large spoonful butter, and some
chopped parsley. Brown nicely and serve. Meal mush fried is nice with
the chicken.--_Mrs. Col. W._


TO DRESS CHICKENS WITH TOMATOES.

Fry till a light brown. Then add some tomatoes, cut in small pieces,
with the juice. Strain the tomatoes from the seed, season them with
salt, pepper, a little sugar, and let them stew.--_Mrs. J. B. D._


TO FRICASSEE CHICKEN.

Wash and joint the chicken; place the pieces in a stew-pan with the
skin side down. Sprinkle salt and pepper on each piece. Add three or
four slices of pork, stew till tender, take them out and thicken the
liquor with flour, and add a piece of butter the size of a hen's egg.
Replace the chicken in the pan and let it stew five minutes longer.
When it is taken up, soak in the gravy some pieces of toast, put them
on plates and lay the chicken on the toast, pouring the gravy over it.
To brown the chicken, stew till tender, without the pork; brown the
pork, take that up, then put in the chicken and fry a light
brown.--_Mrs. Col. W._


TO BROIL CHICKEN.

Kill the chicken the day before using, split open in the back, nicely
clean, and, if the weather is warm, slightly sprinkle with salt. If
for breakfast, half an hour before press between the folds of a clean
towel till dry, grease well with fresh butter, sprinkle with pepper
and salt and lay on a gridiron, over hot coals, with the inside of the
chicken down. Let it cook principally from this side, but turn often
till the outside of the chicken is of a bright, yellow brown. When
thoroughly done, pour over it melted butter, sprinkle pepper, and sift
pounded or grated cracker.--_Mrs. S. T._


CHICKEN PIE.

Cut up the chicken and place in a deep oven with one large spoonful of
lard. Let it brown a little and add one onion, parsley, thyme, sage
and black pepper, to suit the taste. Pour on it a cupful boiling
water, stir well and let it simmer till well cooked. Just before
taking from the fire, rub together:

     1 cup cream.
     1 spoonful butter.
     Yolks of 2 hard-boiled eggs.
     1 grated nutmeg and other spices to the taste.

Stir well and pour in a pan lined with a paste.--_Mrs. A. C._


_Chicken Pie._

Make into a paste one quart of flour with the weight of four eggs in
butter and a large spoonful of lard. Put the paste in a deep dish,
lining the bottom and side with chicken interspersed with layers of
very thin bacon. Add some large crumbs, some pepper, and a
quarter-pound butter. Fill the dish with cold water, and yolks of four
or six hard-boiled eggs, then dredge with flour and put on the top
crust. Let it bake gradually. It will take two hours to bake.--_Mrs.
Col. W._


CHICKEN PUDDING.

Cut up the chicken and stew it a little, after which lay the pieces in
a buttered dish with a few bits of butter, a little pepper and salt,
and a little of the water in which the chicken was stewed.

Make a batter of one quart milk, five eggs, a little salt. Pour this
batter over the chicken, and bake half an hour.--_Mrs. A. B._


_Chicken Pudding._

     10 eggs beaten very light.
     1 quart rich milk.
     1/4 pound melted butter.
     Pepper and salt to the taste.

Stir in enough flour to make a thin, good batter. Put four young
chickens, nicely prepared and jointed, in a saucepan, with some salt
and water and a bundle of thyme or parsley. Boil till nicely done,
then take up the chickens and put in the batter. Put all in a deep
dish and bake. Serve with gravy in a boat.--_Mrs. Dr. C._


CHICKEN PUDDING WITH POTATOES.

Cut up a young chicken as if to fry, and parboil it. Boil and mash
Irish potatoes. Beat up three or four eggs, add to the potatoes, and
thin with milk. Season with butter, pepper and salt, stir in the
chicken, and bake it.

Boiled rice is a good substitute for potatoes.--_Mrs. E. W._

N. B.--Most of the recipes given for turkey apply to pea-fowl, and
most of those given for chicken may be used for guinea fowl.--_Mrs. S.
T._


TO ROAST GOOSE.

A goose must never be eaten the same day it is killed. If the weather
is cold, it should be kept a week before using. Before cooking let it
lie several hours in weak salt and water, to remove the strong taste.
Then plunge it in boiling water, for five minutes, if old. Fill the
goose with a dressing made of:

     Mealy Irish potatoes, boiled and mashed fine.
     A small lump of butter.
     A little salt or fresh pork chopped fine.
     A little minced onion.
     Parsley, thyme, and a pinch of chopped or powdered sage.

Grease with sweet lard or butter. Lay in a pan with the giblets, neck,
etc. Pour in two teacups of boiling water, set in a hot oven, and
baste frequently. Turn so that every part may be equally browned.
Serve with gravy or onion sauce.

The above recipe will answer equally as well for duck.--_Mrs. S. T._


DEVILLED GOOSE.

Plunge the goose into a pot of boiling water and let it remain half an
hour. Fill with a stuffing made of:

Mashed Irish potatoes, a heaping tablespoonful butter, minced onions,
sage, parsley and thyme, half a teaspoonful black pepper.

Place it in a pan with a slice of fat pork and a pint of broth or
liquor in which any kind of meat has been boiled.

Mix two tablespoonfuls pepper vinegar, celery vinegar, made mustard,
and one of acid fruit jelly. Butter the breast of the goose and pour
this mixture over it, adding salt and pepper to the taste.

Place in a hot oven, dredge with flour and baste frequently till done;
when serve with its own gravy. This receipt will answer equally as
well for wild goose.--_Mrs. S. T._


TO PREPARE YOUNG DUCKS.

Kill and hang to drain. Plunge, one at a time, in boiling water, then
immediately in cold water, which makes them easier to pick. Kill some
days before using, or if obliged to use them the same day as killed,
they are better roasted.--_Mrs. R._


TO STEW DUCKS.

Truss the ducks and stuff them with bread, butter, and onion. Flour
them and brown them in lard. Have prepared slips of bacon, giblets,
onion, water, pepper, salt, and a little clove or mace, if you like.
Put in the ducks and let them stew gently but constantly for two
hours. Then add the juice of green grapes or of a lemon, or else a
little lemon pickle. Flour the ducks each time you turn them, and
thicken with butter rolled in flour.--_Mrs. Col. W._




SALADS.


In making salads, be careful to add the vinegar last. Where oil cannot
be obtained, fresh butter, drawn or melted, is an excellent substitute
and is indeed preferred to oil by some persons, epicureans to the
contrary notwithstanding. Always use good cider vinegar in making
salads, as chemical vinegar is sometimes very unwholesome. Much
depends on the rotation in which you mix the ingredients for a salad,
so I would call particular attention to the directions given on this
point on the subsequent pages.


OYSTER SALAD.

     1/2 gallon fresh oysters.
     The yolks of four hard-boiled eggs.
     1 raw egg, well whipped.
     2 large spoonfuls salad oil or melted butter.
     2 teaspoonfuls salt.
     2 teaspoonfuls black pepper.
     2 teaspoonfuls made mustard.
     1 teacup good vinegar.
     2 good sized pickled cucumbers, cut up fine.
     Nearly as much celery as oysters, cut up into small dice.

Drain the liquor from the oysters and throw them into some hot vinegar
on the fire; let them remain until they are _plump_, not cooked. Then
put them at once into clear cold water; this gives them a nice plump
look and they will not then shrink and look small. Drain the water
from them and set them away in a cool place, and prepare your
dressing. Mash the yolks as fine as you can and rub into it the salt,
pepper, and mustard, then rub the oil in, a few drops at a time. When
it is all smooth, add the beaten egg, and then the vinegar, a spoonful
at a time. Set aside. Mix oysters, celery, and pickle, tossing up well
with a silver fork. Sprinkle in salt to your taste. Then pour dressing
over all.--_Mrs. E. P. G._


SALMON AND LOBSTER SALAD.

If the salmon salad is made of the fish preserved in cans, drain it
from the oil and mince the meat fine. Cut up one third as much lettuce
or celery.

For one box of salmon, boil four eggs hard; lay them in cold water a
few minutes, shell and separate the whites from the yolks; lay the
whites aside. Mash the yolks smooth with two tablespoonfuls sweet
olive oil or one teacup sweet rich milk or cream. The oil makes the
smoothest and best paste. Dissolve in one teacup vinegar,

     1 tablespoonful sugar.
     1 teaspoonful salt.
     2 or more teaspoonfuls fine mustard.
     Pepper to the taste.

Mix this with the paste and toss lightly over the meat with a silver
fork. Ornament the dish in which it is served with the green leaves of
the celery, or with curled parsley and the whites of eggs cut in
rings.

Lobster salad is prepared in the same way. Take the nicest parts of
the lobster.--_Mrs. C. C._


LOBSTER SALAD.

Chop up one can of lobsters; cut in small pieces as much celery. Then
cream with one teacup butter, one tablespoonful mustard, one
tablespoonful sugar, one teaspoonful salt, and yolks of four
hard-boiled eggs, rubbed smooth; stir in five tablespoonfuls pepper
vinegar (simply pepper steeped in vinegar and sweetened with a little
sugar), and pour the mixture over the lobster and celery.--_Mrs. S.
T._


FISH SALAD.

Boil four flounders, or any medium sized fish; when done, take off the
skin and pick out the bones, then shred very fine. Add pepper and
salt, one tablespoonful mixed mustard, a half cup vinegar, and half a
pound butter, and mix all well with the fish. Put into shallow pans,
set in the oven and bake ten minutes. When cold put over it a little
Worcestershire sauce, and sherry wine.--_Miss F. N._


TERRAPIN SALAD.

Boil them until the shells will come off easily and the nails pull
out; then cut into small pieces and carefully remove the sand-bag and
gall.

To three good sized terrapins, take six hard-boiled eggs; remove the
yolks and rub into a powder with half a pound sweet butter. When
creamy and light, add one teaspoonful flour. Put this with the meat
into a saucepan; season with cayenne pepper and salt, and let it boil
for one or two minutes. Just before taking from the fire, add wine to
taste, and if desired, a little mace.

Be careful to remove the skin from the legs.--_Mrs. A. M. D._


TURKEY SALAD.

Mince the turkey very fine. Have ready the following mixture, for a
large company.

Twelve or fourteen eggs boiled hard; mash the yolks smooth with one
spoonful water; add to it pepper, salt, and mustard to the taste. Two
teaspoonfuls celery-seed, one teacup of fresh melted butter or fine
olive oil, and pour in strong vinegar to the taste.

Mix the turkey and celery, and pour over the mixture just before
eating.--_Mrs. F. C. W._


_Turkey Salad._

Remove the skin and fat from a turkey; mince the meat fine.

     Mince 2 or 3 slices lean ham.
     2 or 3 bunches celery.
     3 or 4 apples.
     3 or 4 cucumber pickles; mix well together.

Prepare a dressing of the yolks of four eggs, rubbed in a little thick
cream.

     4 tablespoonfuls butter.
     2 teaspoonfuls black pepper.
     2 teaspoonfuls salt.
     2 teaspoonfuls of mustard.
     Vinegar to the taste.

     --_Mrs. Dr. S._


_Turkey Salad._

Boil two turkeys till well done, pick out all the bones, skin and fat,
and cut up the balance in small pieces.

Boil one dozen eggs hard, let them cool, then separate the yolks and
whites, mash the yolks fine, chop the whites very fine and set them to
one side.

Have a large flat dish, in which put four large spoonfuls mixed
mustard; pour in a little oil, and with a fork rub it in till smooth,
then a little vinegar, in which has been melted two full
tablespoonfuls of salt, then oil, and alternately put in oil and
vinegar, each time rubbing it in till well mixed. When you have mixed
a whole bottle of oil and one pint vinegar till it is as smooth as
butter, add one heaping teaspoonful cayenne pepper, three teaspoonfuls
celery-seed rubbed fine in a mortar, and one large mango cut fine, put
in stuffing and all.

Have ready as much celery as you have fowl, cut fine, mix meat and
celery carefully together, and pour the dressing over all.--_Mrs. E.
I._


CHICKEN SALAD.

One large chicken boiled; when cold remove the skin and chop into a
dish, over which throw a towel slightly dipped in cold water to keep
the meat moist. When the celery is cut, put between clean cloths to
dry.

Take one tablespoonful best mustard, the yolk of one raw egg, which
drop into a dish large enough to hold all the dressing; beat well for
ten minutes and slowly add to the mustard one tablespoonful vinegar.

When well mixed add three-eighths bottle of oil, a drop at a time,
always stirring the same way.

Rub the yolks of six hard-boiled eggs very smooth and stir in half a
teacup of vinegar. Pour this mixture to the mustard, oil, etc.,
stirring together as lightly as possible.

Add to the chicken one pint chopped celery, a little yellow pickle,
and half a loaf of stale bread crumbs, and the oil taken from the
water in which the chicken has boiled. Salt and pepper to taste.

Pour on the dressing just before serving. If the salad is kept too
cool the dressing will curdle.--_Mrs. E._


_Chicken Salad._

     The meat of 2 boiled fowls chopped very fine.
     2 or 3 heads of cabbage cut fine.
     1 cup olive oil.

oil. Lastly, add two-thirds teacup of vinegar.--_Mrs. C. C. McP._

a stewpan with boiling water. Then stir together until smooth, one
quarter of a pound butter, one teaspoonful flour and yolk of one raw
egg; all of which add to the chicken one half at a time, stirring all
well together.

Season with salt and pepper.

Let it simmer ten minutes; then add half a gill of Madeira wine, and
send to the table while hot.--_Mrs. P._


CELERY SALAD.

     1 raw egg.
     2 tablespoonfuls melted butter, or 1 of oil.
     1 tablespoonful sugar.

vinegar last. Cut the celery into pieces half an inch long. Set all in
a cool place.

Just before serving sprinkle over a little salt and black pepper, then
pour over the dressing.

If you have any cold fowl, chicken, or turkey left from dinner, chop
it up and mix it with some of the above--equal proportions of
both--and it will make a delicious salad; or a few oysters left in the
tureen will be a great addition to the celery salad.--_Mrs. S. T._

To be stirred over a slow fire till it thickens, it must only be warm
or it will curdle and spoil.--_Mrs. S._


SAUCE FOR COD'S HEAD.

Take a lobster, stick a skewer through the tail, to keep the water
out; throw a handful of salt in the water. When it boils put in the
lobster and boil half an hour; pick off the spawns, if any, and pound

serve. Tarragon vinegar may be used instead of plain, and by many is
considered far preferable.--_Mrs. C._


MAITRE D'HOTE SAUCE.

oil, and celery instead of horseradish.--_Mrs. P. W._


MUSHROOM SAUCE, FOR FRIED OR BROILED FISH.

Get fine-grown fresh gathered mushrooms; break them up and sprinkle
salt over them. Let them lie for the juice to run out, stirring them
often. When the juice has been extracted, strain it, boil well with a
little ginger and pepper.

Do not season much, as it is the mushroom flavor to be desired. You
can add seasoning as required; all necessary to keep it is enough salt
and pepper.

This makes a nice flavoring for any sauce or gravy mixed with soy or
lemon pickle.--_Mrs. C. C._

two teaspoonfuls flour; when thoroughly mixed, put it into a saucepan
and add to it four tablespoonfuls cold water.

Cover the pan and set it in a kettle of boiling water, shake it round
continually, always moving it the same way. When the butter is
entirely melted and begins to simmer, then let it rest until it boils
up. In melting butter for pudding, some substitute milk for
water.--_Mrs. Dr. S._


_Drawn Butter._

Cream together one-quarter pound fresh butter, with two heaping
teaspoonfuls sifted flour; add to this six teaspoonfuls water.

Put it in a small tin saucepan and set it in a vessel of boiling
water, until it begins to simmer, shaking it often.--_Mrs. S. T._


_Drawn Butter._

Rub a piece of butter in a little flour, add two or three
tablespoonfuls boiling water.

Shake continually over the fire without letting it boil, till it
thickens.--_Mrs. P. W._


CRANBERRY SAUCE.

Stew two quarts cranberries; putting only water enough to keep from
sticking to the bottom of kettle. Keep covered until nearly done, then
stir in one quart white sugar, and boil until thick. The color is
finer when the sugar is added just before the sauce is done.--_Mrs. S.
T._


MUSHROOM SAUCE.

Wash and pick one pint young mushrooms, rub them with salt to take off
the tender skin. Put them in a saucepan with a little salt, nutmeg,
one blade of mace, one pint cream, lump of butter rubbed in flour.

Boil them up and stir till done, then pour it round the chickens.
Garnish with lemon.--_Mrs. C. C._




SALAD DRESSINGS.

Take the yolk of one raw egg; add to that one-half tablespoonful of
either dry or thickly mixed mustard, salt and pepper to your taste.

When well mixed together, add sweet oil in _very_ small quantities, at
a time, stirring briskly until it is very thick. Then add a little
vinegar, but not sufficient to make the dressing thin. These are the
proportions for the yolk of one raw egg, sufficient for four people.
The quantity of eggs, mustard, etc., must be increased in proportion
to the quantity of dressing needed.--_Mrs. McK._


SALAD DRESSING.

     Beat two eggs. Add butter size of half an egg.
     1/2 teaspoonful mustard rubbed smooth in a little water.
     4 tablespoonfuls vinegar.
     1/2 teacupful boiling water.

Set it in a bowl on top of the tea-kettle and stir until as thick as
cream.--_Mrs. W. H. M._


DRESSING.

To one tumblerful vinegar, warmed in a stewpan, add four beaten eggs;
stir for a few minutes till cooked like boiled custard. Then throw in:

     A teaspoonful of salt.
     1 teaspoonful of sugar.
     1 teaspoonful of mustard.
     1 teaspoonful of pepper.
     A lump of butter size of half an egg, instead of oil.

Stir well and pour out. Will keep for weeks. Good for chicken
salad.--_Mrs. W._


DRESSING FOR SALAD.

Turkey is more economical and better for salad than chicken. To one
turkey, weighing about nine pounds, allow nine eggs:

     7 hard-boiled eggs.
     2 raw eggs, yolks and whites beaten separately.
     To each egg allow 2 tablespoonfuls salad oil, perfectly pure and
       sweet.
     1 saltspoonful salt.
     1 saltspoonful made mustard.
     2 saltspoonfuls cayenne pepper to the whole amount.
     Celery to the taste.
     Lettuce leaves, if in season, using only the heart.
     The juice of 2 lemons.

This will last a week.--_Mrs. A. M. D._


DRESSING FOR CHICKEN SALAD.

To four chickens, the yolks of twelve eggs mashed very smooth with:

     1 raw egg beaten light.
     1/2 teacup of mustard.
     1/2 teaspoonful red pepper.
     1 teacup salad oil.
     1 cup of vinegar.
     1 quart of cut celery.
     Salt to the taste.--_Mrs. J. W._


LETTUCE DRESSING.

     1 raw egg.
     1 tablespoonful sugar.
     1 teaspoonful salt.
     1/2 teaspoonful mustard.
     A little cayenne pepper (never use black pepper on lettuce).
     2 tablespoonfuls best olive oil.
     1 tablespoonful vinegar.--_Miss R. S._

DRESSING FOR CABBAGE.

     The yolk of an egg.
     1 teaspoonful salt.
     1 teaspoonful mustard.
     2 teaspoonfuls sugar, mashed smooth.
     1 cup of cream.
     Vinegar to your taste.--_Mrs. E. C. G._


SANA MAYONNAISE.

The yolks (raw) of two eggs.

Stir in oil, a drop at a time, until it begins to thicken, and then
pour it in slowly still, but in greater quantities, stirring
continually. Add cayenne pepper, salt, and vinegar to the taste.

If mustard is liked in the sauce, it must be mixed with the yolks of
the eggs before dropping the oil.

This sauce should be nearly as thick as soft butter. It makes a
delicious dressing for lettuce, celery, cold poultry or game; and also
for cold boiled fish or pickled salmon. If used with the latter, the
salmon should be placed in the centre of the dish and covered thickly
with sauce.

Boiled chestnuts, peeled, small pickled onions, sliced cucumbers,
lettuce, etc., are a great addition, and should be used to dress or
garnish the dish, but not be mixed with the salmon.--_Mrs. E. P.,
Cin._


SALAD FOR SLAW.

     3 eggs well beaten.
     Nearly a cup of sugar.
     1 tablespoonful butter.
     1 tablespoonful mustard.
     Pepper and salt to your taste.
     Tumbler of milk.
     Tumbler of vinegar.

Stir well over the fire until as thick as custard. Let it cool and
pour over cabbage.--_Mrs. R. A._


DRESSING FOR COLD SLAW.

     1 cup of vinegar.
     2 eggs well beaten.
     1 teaspoonful salt.
     1 teaspoonful mustard.
     1 tablespoonful sugar.
     1 tablespoonful butter.
     A little black pepper.

Mix together the butter, salt, pepper, sugar, mustard; add the eggs
last.

Have the vinegar boiling and pour it on, stirring all the time. Then
pour it back in the saucepan and boil a few minutes. Pour on the slaw
when cold.--_Miss N._


LETTUCE DRESSING.

     Yolks of 4 eggs.
     1 teacup milk.
     1 teacup vinegar.
     4 tablespoonfuls oil or melted butter.

After mixing all well together, except the vinegar, let it come to a
boil. When cold, beat well, add the vinegar, salt, pepper, and made
mustard to suit the taste. Keep corked in a bottle.--_Mrs. A. M. D._


SALAD DRESSING.

Put one tumbler vinegar, and one lump butter, size of an egg, on to
boil.

Beat up the yolks of three or four eggs, and pour the boiling vinegar
over them, stirring all the time; return it to the fire and continue
to stir, until it thickens like custard. When it is perfectly cold add
one tumblerful cream, into which has been mixed one tablespoonful
salt, one tablespoonful mustard, two spoonfuls sugar, and one spoonful
bruised celery-seed.

Bottle the dressing and it will keep for a month.--_Mrs. P._


CELERY DRESSING.

     2 tablespoonfuls butter.
     2 beaten eggs.
     1 teaspoonful salt.
     1 teaspoonful mixed mustard.
     1 cup vinegar.
     1 cup fresh milk or cream.

Boil and use cold.--_Mrs. I. D._


TO DRESS CELERY.

Beat light the yolk of one egg; add:

     2 tablespoonfuls cream.
     1 tablespoonful white sugar.
     3 tablespoonfuls vinegar.
     1 teaspoonful olive oil.
     1 teaspoonful mustard.
     1 teaspoonful salt.--_Mrs. Dr. S._




BRUNSWICK STEWS, GUMBO, AND SIDE DISHES.


BRUNSWICK STEW.

     A twenty-five cent shank of beef.
     A five-cent loaf of bread--square loaf, as it has more crumb, and
       the crust is not used.
     1 quart potatoes cooked and mashed.
     1 quart cooked butter-beans.
     1 quart raw corn.
     11/2 quart raw tomatoes peeled and chopped.

If served at two o'clock, put on the shank as for soup, at the
earliest possible hour; then about twelve o'clock take the shank out
of the soup and shred and cut all of the meat as fine as you can,
carefully taking out bone and gristle, and then return it to the
soup-pot and add all of the vegetables; the bread and two slices of
middling are an improvement to it.

Season with salt and pepper to the taste; and when ready to serve,
drop into the tureen two or three tablespoonfuls butter.

This makes a tureen and about a vegetable-dish full.--_Mrs. R. P._


_Brunswick Stew._

About four hours before dinner, put on two or three slices of bacon,
two squirrels or chickens, one onion sliced, in one gallon water. Stew
some time, then add one quart peeled tomatoes, two ears of grated

part pod of red pepper.

Stew altogether about one hour, till you can take out the bones. When
done, put in one spoonful bread crumbs and one large spoonful
butter.--_Mrs. M. M. D._


_Brunswick Stew._

Take one chicken or two squirrels, cut them up and put one-half gallon
water to them. Let it stew until the bones can be removed. Add
one-half dozen large tomatoes, one-half pint butter-beans, and corn
cut from half a dozen ears, salt, pepper, and butter as
seasoning.--_Mrs. I. H._

Put one tablespoonful lard into a pan. Slice two onions and fry them
in it a few minutes. Have ready a chicken cut up, and fry it in the
lard till it slightly browns, also one or two slices of bacon or pork,
and three or four bunches parsley cut up.

Have a heaping plateful of ochra cut up; put that in the pan and let
it wilt a few minutes (you must stir it), then add three or four
tomatoes cut up. Then put the whole into a stewpan, pour hot water to
it, not quite as much as for soup. Let it boil until quite thick.
Season with pepper and salt, also red or green pod pepper.

It must be dished like soup and eaten with rice; the rice to be boiled
dry and served in a vegetable dish; put one or two spoonfuls in a
plate and pour the gumbo over it.--_Mrs. G._


_Gumbo._

Cut up two chickens, fry slightly with a little onion, and a few
slices pickled pork.

Put in three or four quarts boiling water, together with pepper and
salt, eighteen okras, one-half peck cut up tomatoes.

_Gumbo._

Take one chicken, frying size, cut up in hot lard; add one quart ochra
chopped fine, and one good sized onion chopped fine, when the chicken
begins to brown, stirring all the time until it ceases to rope and is
a nice brown.

Then put it into a deep vessel and pour on enough boiling water to
make soup for ten or twelve persons, adding two or three tomatoes,
skinned and sliced, two ears of tender corn, salt, and black and red
pepper to the taste.

Let the whole boil one hour.

Boil rice very dry and serve with it.--_Mrs. P. McG._


GUMBO FILIT A LA CREOLE.

Put into a deep pot one tablespoonful lard, when hot put in one
tablespoonful flour, stir in until brown, then slice one large onion
and fry it till brown; skim out the onion and do not put it back until
a chicken cut up in small pieces has been fried. Stir it all the time.
Have a kettle of boiling water near by; pour one or two cups of water
on the chicken, stir well and let it simmer slowly. Add:

     10 allspice.
     8 cloves.
     Red and black pepper.
     Parsley and thyme if you like it.

Put in two quarts of water, boiling, and let it boil gently two hours.
Have ready the liquor from one quart oysters, put that in with the
water; put the oysters in later, allowing them time to cook. When
ready to serve stir in one tablespoonful filit, boil up once. To be
eaten with rice cooked dry.

N. B. _Filit_ is only pulverized sassafras leaves, dried and sifted;
you can make it yourself.--_Mrs. S., La._


VEAL PATES.

     31/2 pounds leg of veal.
     1/4 pound salt pork.
     6 soda crackers rolled and sifted.
     1 tablespoonful salt.
     1 tablespoonful black pepper.
     1 nutmeg.
     2 eggs well beaten.
     Butter the size of an egg.

Hash veal and pork together, cutting very fine. Then mix seasoning
very thoroughly and form into oval shapes. Put a small piece of butter
and bread crumbs over the top, while in the baking dish; half a teacup
water, and baste frequently while baking. In moulding it and when
mixing it keep wetting the hands in cold water, also wet the dish
when you begin moulding it in shape.--_Mrs. J. P. H._


HASHED MUTTON.

Cut cold mutton into very thin slices, and make a gravy by boiling the
bones for two hours with a little onion, pepper and salt.

Strain this gravy and thicken it with a little flour, adding a small
amount of tomato or mushroom gravy to flavor it, and a small piece of
butter. When the gravy is of a proper consistency, put in the slices
of mutton, and let it simmer slowly for ten minutes. Serve on a
platter with parsley and sippets of bread.


_Hashed Mutton._

Fry in a saucepan three small onions, and three small slices of bacon
or ham, until they are brown; then add a little more than half a pint
water, and thicken it with flour. Next strain it and add it to the
meat with a little sauce; pepper and salt to the taste.

It will take about an hour to hash.


MUTTON HASH.

Cut the meat up fine, putting the bones on to stew in water; then take
out the bones and put in the hash, with pepper, salt and gravy left
from the day before.

Let these stew at least half an hour. Put in one large tablespoonful
browned flour. Add--

     6 tablespoonfuls red wine.
     1 tablespoonful walnut catsup.
     1 tablespoonful tomato catsup.
     A lump of butter rolled in a little flour.

If a small dish, proportion the seasoning.

Beef, goose, and duck hash can be made the same way.--_Mrs. R._


HOTCH POTCH.

During the summer season get lamb chops, which half fry. Cut up
cabbage, lettuce, turnips, onions and any other vegetables, which
boil, with seasoning of pepper, salt, etc.; one hour before dinner,
put in the lamb chops, with some green peas; boil the potatoes
separately.


SCOTCH BROTH.

     3 pounds of the scrag end of a neck of mutton.
     1 onion.
     1 small turnip.
     A little parsley.
     A little thyme.

Put the mutton in the pan and cover with two quarts cold water, add
the vegetables and not quite one teacup rice; one small carrot and a
little celery added will give a nice flavor.

When it boils, skim carefully, cover the pan, and let it simmer for
two hours. Of course, the vegetables must be cut small.


MEAT LOAF.

Chop fine whatever cold meat you may have, fat and lean together; add
pepper and salt, one finely chopped onion, two slices of bread which
have been soaked in milk, and one egg.

Mix well together and bake in a form. This makes an admirable tea or
breakfast dish.--_Mrs. J._


BLACK STEW.

Take any kind of fresh meat that has been boiled or roasted, cut up
enough to make a dish; put one tablespoonful currant jelly, one
tablespoonful of wine, one large spoonful butter, one-half onion
chopped, pepper and salt.

Stir all together fifteen minutes. Pickle cut up is an improvement,
and brown sugar can be used instead of currant jelly.--_Mrs. J. T._


A NICE SIDE-DISH.

Make a mince meat of turkey; after it is stewed put boiled rice
around the dish and set it in an oven to brown. Then garnish with hard
boiled eggs.--_Mrs. E. I._


MEAT CROQUETTES.

Any nice cold meat when nicely minced will make good croquettes,
especially veal. Take about one-quarter loaf bread, well soaked in
water and squeezed dry; mix with the minced meat about one
dessertspoonful chopped parsley, one dessertspoonful ground ginger,
three eggs, a pinch of ground mace, pepper and salt, roll them into
egg-shaped balls; have ready two or three eggs well beaten, in one
plate, and flour in another; first roll in the flour, then in the egg,
fry in boiling drippings; serve hot.--_Mrs. T._


CROQUETTES.

Take cold fowl or fresh meat of any kind, with slices of fat ham; chop
together very fine, add one-half as much stale bread grated, salt and
pepper, grated nutmeg, one tablespoonful catsup, one teaspoonful made
mustard, and lump of butter size of an egg. Mix well together till it
resembles sausage meat; mould them into cakes, dip into well beaten
yolk of an egg, cover thickly with grated bread. Fry a light
brown.--_Mrs. F. D._


_Croquettes._

Boil or roast a turkey, chop the meat as fine as possible. Mix eight
beaten eggs with the meat, add one quart of milk, one-quarter pound
butter, salt and pepper, a little mace.

Stew all together for a few minutes, then take it off to cool and make
into little cone shapes. Roll each one into pounded crackers and drop
in boiling lard till a light brown.--_Mrs. M. E. L. W., Md._


CHICKEN CROQUETTES.

Cold chicken, chopped parsley, a little cream, grated crackers, lemon
flavoring, salt and pepper. Cut chicken very fine and season with salt
and pepper; add chopped parsley, moisten with cream sufficient to
make paste; mould in a wineglass with grated cracker or bread crumbs
on outside. Fry quickly in hot lard. Brown lightly. Lemon flavoring
can be added at will.--_Mrs. G. P._


POTATO CROQUETTES.

Peel, boil, and mash one quart potatoes, mix with yolks of four eggs
and some milk.

Set on the fire, stir two minutes; set on a dish to cool or leave
overnight. In the morning add a little milk, mix thoroughly, roll in
bread crumbs; divide in cakes and fry in lard. Take off when done;
drain, dish, and serve immediately.--_Mrs. E._


CROQUETTE BALLS.

Chop up one quart of any cold meat very fine, to which add one pint
stale bread. Mix up one egg, mustard, pepper, salt and butter, and
pour over the bread and meat; roll into balls, which must be rolled
into the white of an egg, then into bread crumbs, and bake a nice
brown. This is a nice side-dish for breakfast or tea.--_Mrs. S. G._


CROQUETTES.

Have some nice pieces of veal or fowl, chopped fine, season with
nutmeg, pepper and salt to your taste.

Boil one-half pint milk with one small garlic. Thicken with two
tablespoonfuls flour, and one tablespoonful butter.

Let it remain till thoroughly done: stir in the meat and then form the
croquettes. Roll in bread crumbs, then the yolk of an egg, then in
bread crumbs, and fry a nice brown.--_Miss E. P._


_Croquettes._

Take cold meat or fresh meat, with grated ham, fat and lean, chopped
very fine--add one-half as much stale bread grated, salt, pepper, and
nutmeg, one tablespoonful catsup, a lump of butter.

Knead all well together--if not soft enough add cream or gravy. Make
in cakes the shape of a pear; dip them in the yolk of an egg beaten,
roll in dried bread crumbs, and fry a light brown.--_Miss M. C. L._


SAUSAGE CROQUETTES.

     2 pounds of meat.
     4 eggs.
     1 cup butter.
     1 cup milk.

Add powdered cracker or stale bread crumbs sufficient to thicken,
while on the fire. Roll in oblong shapes and fry in lard. Roll the
balls in cracker dust before frying.--_Mrs. R. K. M._


SAUSAGE CROQUETTES.

One pound sausage meat, two eggs, well beaten, and bread crumbs well
minced.

Make the meat into cakes, then roll in the beaten egg, and afterwards
in bread crumbs. Fry in pan and serve hot. Cold ham served in the same
way is delicious; mince it very fine.--_Mrs. G._


FORCEMEAT BALLS.

One pound of fresh suet, one ounce ready dressed veal, or chicken
chopped fine, bread crumbs, a little shallot or onion, salt and pepper
(white), nutmeg; parsley and thyme, finely shred.

Beat as many eggs, yolks and whites separately, as will make the above
ingredients into a moist paste; roll into small balls, and fry in
boiling lard. When of a light brown, take out with a perforated
skimmer. Forcemeat balls made in this way are remarkably light, but
being somewhat greasy, some persons prefer them with less suet and
eggs.--_Mrs. A. M. D._


MINCE WITH BREAD CRUMBS.

Chop up any kind of cold meat very fine, place in a baking dish a
layer of bread crumbs, seasoned with lump of butter, black pepper, and
salt.

Then a layer of minced meat, and so on with alternate layers, till the
dish is filled. Pour over all a cup of rich cream, and be sure to have
enough lumps of butter to make it rich. Bake until it is a good brown
on top.--_Mrs. C. M. A._


MINCE WITH POTATOES.

Chop fine any cold meat; parboil enough Irish potatoes to be
two-thirds as many as there is chopped meat. Mix all together with one
raw egg, one onion, black pepper, and salt.

Fry with butter, either in large or small cakes in a pan, the cakes
rather larger than sausages. If you have cold ham, it is an advantage
to add some of it to the mince; and the whole is very nice made of
cold pickled beef.--_Mrs. C. M. A._


POT POURRI.

Take any kind of fresh meat chopped fine, and put into a stewpan with
a little warm water, pepper and salt, and chopped onion. Cook twenty
minutes; then put into a baking-dish with an equal quantity of bread
crumbs, and pour over a cup of sweet cream. Bake to a light
brown.--_Mrs. F. D._


HASH.

One and one-half teacup of boiling water must be poured into a
saucepan, mix one heaping spoonful flour with one tablespoonful cold
water, stir it in and boil three minutes. Then add two teaspoonfuls
salt, half a small teaspoonful pepper, and butter size of an egg.

After removing all tough, gristly pieces from the cold cooked meat,
chop it fine with some boiled potatoes. Put them in the dressing, heat
through, then serve. It injures meat to cook it _again_, making it
hard and unpalatable. Should you have any cold gravy left, use it; in
that case you will require less butter, salt and pepper. You can serve
it with buttered toast underneath, or you may set it into the oven to
brown on top, or drop eggs into a skillet of boiling salt water, and
when cooked, place on top of hash.--_Mrs. J._


CASSA ROLLS.

Boil some Irish potatoes until quite done, mash them smooth and add an
equal quantity of salt meat chopped fine. Mix with this several well
beaten eggs, one spoonful butter, some pepper and salt.

Bake in little cakes like potato cakes.--_Mrs. F. D._


RAGOUT SOUSE.

Split four feet once, fry with one or two dozen large oysters, a light
brown. Lay them in a stewpan over the liquor from the oysters, or some
beef or veal gravy; add one large spoonful butter rolled in flour, one
dozen allspice, beaten, one glass red wine, one glass walnut catsup,
and pepper.

Stew gently until dinner, skimming off any grease. Garnish with
hard-boiled eggs. Mace or cloves may be used instead of
allspice.--_Mrs. B._


BREAKFAST DISH.

Take the remnant of any cold meats, either boiled or roasted. Prepare
it, as if for chicken salad, in fine shreds. Mix with potatoes mashed
fine, and add two well-beaten eggs.

Season with butter, pepper, and other spices if you like.

Make it into a loaf and bake it brown, or fry it in cakes if
preferred.--_Mrs. J. F. G._


MOCK TERRAPIN.

Mince cold veal very fine, sprinkle with salt and cayenne. Mash the
yolks of three hard-boiled eggs, three tablespoonfuls cooking wine,
three tablespoonfuls cream or milk, a little nutmeg and a little mixed
mustard, a large lump of butter with a little flour rubbed in.

Let all steam five minutes, and serve hot on toast.

A nice relish for breakfast or lunch.--_Miss E. S., La._


BREAKFAST DISH.

One pound pork sausage, one tablespoonful pounded crackers, two well
beaten eggs. Work thoroughly together, and make into cakes. These will
be rather soft, but dropping each one into a plate of pounded or
grated cracker will enable you to handle them. Put into a hot
frying-pan. No lard is to be used, but keep the pan covered while
frying.--_Miss E._


BAKED HASH.

Take cold beef or veal, chop the meat very fine, put it in a pan with
some water; add salt, pepper, butter and bread crumbs to taste. Season
with a little chopped onion, parsley and thyme, all minced fine, half
a cup milk or cream with one egg beaten. Grate some crumbs over the
top, and bake till brown.--_Mrs. J. H. F._


SANDWICHES.

Grate one quarter pound cold ham in a bowl, with one tablespoonful
chopped pickle, one teaspoonful mustard, a little black pepper, six
dessertspoonfuls butter; put in a bowl and stir quickly until a cream.

Add the ham and seasoning, mix all together well. Have slices of light
bread and spread the mixture on each side of each slice.

Cold grated tongue, instead of ham, is very nice spread on the inside
of biscuit.


_Sandwiches._

Mince ham and tongue together, and spread between buttered bread. Add
a little French mustard to the mince if liked.--_Mrs. R._


PILLAU.

Take cold fresh meat, either chicken or veal, and cut it up quite
small after taking off the outer skin either fat or gristle. Mix it
well with some cold rice, then stir this in a batter made of two eggs
well beaten, and about one quart milk. Season with salt, pepper, and
butter.

Bake in a deep dish.--_Mrs. A. B._


CALF'S HEAD PUDDING.

Skin the head, take out the brains. Thoroughly wash, then soak the
head one night to extract the blood. Put on in cold water and boil
five or six hours, or until the bones are ready to drop out. Pick it
very fine, taking all the bones out; then add the liquor in which it
was boiled, one tablespoonful butter, four eggs well beaten; one small
piece of lemon or pickle; one onion, if liked; pepper and salt.

Lay the brains all over the top and bake. Bread crumbs are an
improvement. The liquor seasoned makes excellent soup.--_Miss F. E._


LIVER PUDDING.

Take two hog's heads, clean nicely; two livers, two lights, and cut
all the good part off half a dozen milts; half a dozen sweetbreads;
half a dozen kidneys, split open.

Put all together in a tub of salt and water; let them soak all night;
take them out next morning, put them in a kettle with two slices of
fat pork. Let all boil until done, then take it up and let it cool a
little and grind it in a sausage mill, and while grinding, skim some
of the grease off of the kettle and pour it into the mill. After it is
ground, season with black pepper, salt, and onions chopped fine, to
suit the taste.

If it is not rich enough, boil more middling or pork and mix with the
meat; if stuffed, boil again a few minutes.


PIG'S HEAD PUDDING.

Boil head and liver until perfectly done, cut up as for hash. Put it
on again in warm water and season highly with butter, pepper, salt,
and a little chopped onion.

After well seasoned, put in a baking-dish with one egg beaten light.
Bake two hours, and lay over hard-boiled eggs sliced, and strips of
pastry across the top.

Calf's Head Pudding can be made in the same way.--_Mrs. Col. S._


POTATO PIE.

The remains of cold mutton, either roasted or boiled, cut into nice
slices, three hard-boiled eggs, also sliced, and two or three
potatoes, seasoning of pepper, salt, and pounded mace to your taste.

All laid alternately in a baking-dish and filled nearly up with any
gravy or stock at hand; cover with a potato crust, full two inches
thick, and bake until the potatoes are a nice brown color. If the
potatoes are scratched over with a fork, it gives them a pretty, rough
appearance. To make the crust, boil and mash the potatoes with a
little butter and milk and a small quantity of salt.--_Mrs. R. P._


A NICE PIE.

One pound steak, three soft crackers rolled, one small piece of
butter, two tablespoonfuls of water, salt and pepper. Bake in a deep
pan.--_Mrs. R._


POTATO PIE.

A savory potato pie is made thus: A layer of mashed potatoes placed in
a pie dish and then slices of any cold meat (if chicken or veal,
slices of tongue or ham may be added), and herbs, pepper and salt,
sprinkled over to taste. Continue these layers alternately till the
dish is full; the potatoes must well cover the top, which should have
some butter added, and be brushed over with the yolk of an egg, and
put into the oven till done through. A little butter on each layer is
needed if the meat is not fat, and it should not be too fat.--_Mrs.
S._


CRUMB PIE.

Mince any cold meat very finely, season it to taste, and put it into a
pie dish; have some finely grated bread crumbs, with a little salt,
pepper, and nutmeg; and pour into the dish any gravy that is at hand.
Cover over with a thick layer of bread crumbs and put small pieces of
butter over top. Place in the oven till a fine brown. Send to the
table hot.--_Mrs. W._


HAGGIS.

Cut cold beef in pieces and mix with mashed potatoes; fill a
baking-dish and season with butter, pepper, and salt. Bake and serve
hot.


COLD CHICKEN WITH VINEGAR.

Cut up the chicken in fine pieces and crack the bones. Season with
salt and pepper; put it in a deep baking plate with a lump of butter,
and one tablespoonful vinegar. Cover it with hot water. Put a plate
over it and stew on a stove or over hot embers. Add one heaping teacup
chopped celery to the mixture before cooking.--_Mrs. A. P._


DEVILLED COLD CHICKEN.

Take the legs and wings of any cold fowl.

Dress with pepper, salt, mustard, and butter; then broil.


GIBLET PIE.

Made as chicken pie, adding livers of chicken or pigeon, which have
been boiled in the water left from cooking; celery and sweet herbs.
Season with mushroom or walnut catsup.--_Mrs. T._


SQUAB PIE.

After the squabs are picked and drawn as a large fowl is for roasting,
wash them and put them in a saucepan with a close cover. They should
be covered with boiling water and boiled slowly till tender, when a
little salt and an onion clove should be added. Then take them out,
drain and dry, and put in each squab a teaspoonful of butter, a little
pepper, salt, minced parsley and thyme. Then put into the cavity of
each squab, a hard-boiled egg. Lay them in a large, round, earthen
baking dish, three or four inches deep. Strain over them the liquor in
which they were simmered. Add a tablespoonful of butter and a teacup
of milk or cream. Sift in two tablespoonfuls of cracker crumbs not
browned, a tablespoonful of minced parsley and thyme, and a little
salt. Put in a few slips of pastry. Cover with a rich crust and bake.

The same recipe will answer for robins, except that the eggs must be
chopped, instead of being placed whole in the cavity of the
bird.--_Mrs. S. T._


BEEF CAKES.

Chop pieces of roast beef very fine. Mix up grated bread crumbs,
chopped onions, and parsley; season with pepper and salt, moisten with
a little dripping or catsup.

Cold ham or tongue may be added to improve it.

Make in broad, flat cakes, and spread a coat of mashed potatoes on the
top and bottom of each. Lay a piece of butter on every cake and put it
in an oven to brown.

Other cold meats may be prepared in the same way for a breakfast
dish.--_Mrs. D._


FISH AND POTATOES.

Boil salmon or other fish; mash up boiled Irish potatoes; chop yolks
of hard boiled eggs.

Mix all together with butter; make very hot, and keep it so at
table.--_Mrs. R._


BEEFSTEAK AND POTATOES.

Cut up in a stewpan, with cold water, and stew till well cooked, the
steak you will use; mash some potatoes with creamed butter, pepper and
salt.

Line a baking dish with it and put in the steak, seasoning with
butter, pepper, and salt. Bake a little while.


BACON FRAISE.

Take a nice piece of middling about six inches square, pare off the
skin and cut in small square pieces, then fry it. Make a batter of
three pints flour, five eggs, one handful parsley, chopped fine. Beat
all light and fry with bacon. Serve hot. This will make two
dishes.--_Mrs. M. D._


ITALIAN MANNER OF COOKING MACARONI.

One and a half pound macaroni, parboiled with a little salt, and one
clove garlic. One pound of beef chopped fine, lean and fat stewed with
one pint tomatoes.

Alternate layers of macaroni and the stewed beef with grated cheese.
Add cayenne pepper, salt, butter, and a little wine.

A thick layer of grated cracker crumbs and cheese on top. Serve with a
stand of grated Stilton cheese.--_Mrs. R. R._


MACARONI.

Break into pieces one inch long and put in the dish you wish to fill,
filling it only one-third full. Wash well and boil in a covered
stewpan until soft and tender, drain off all the water; cover with
this the bottom of a baking dish. Sprinkle over pepper and salt,
grated cracker, bits of butter and grated cheese; then another layer
of macaroni, etc., in the same order. When the dish is filled, pour
over fresh milk until all is barely covered. Sift over pounded cracker
and set in the oven. If it becomes too brown, sift over more cracker
before serving.--_Mrs. S. T._


_Macaroni._

Boil one-half pound macaroni in water, with salt, one small onion and
two blades mace.

Put in one sweetbread, chopped fine, or the same amount of fresh veal,
the nice part being taken.

Boil till tender before taking it up, drain off the water and add one
large spoonful butter, one-half pint milk, a quantity of grated
cheese; one teaspoonful mustard; two teaspoonfuls black pepper, one
pint skinned tomatoes, salt to the taste; one egg, beaten up, is a
great improvement.

Butter a deep dish and bake the macaroni a light brown. Have it served
with a small bowl of grated cheese, of the best quality, so that each
one may add what they like.--_Mrs. M. C._


_Macaroni._

Parboil enough macaroni to make a dish; lay alternate layers of
macaroni, and grated cheese. Season with salt, pepper, and butter; add
three eggs, well beaten, and enough milk to fill a dish. Sprinkle
bread crumbs over top and bake.--_Mrs. R. A._


_Macaroni._

To one and one-half pound macaroni, add one pound beef, chopped fine.
Make a stew of the beef with one quart water, one clove of garlic,
catsup, tomato, or walnut, to suit the taste, one dessertspoonful
currant jelly, salt and pepper.

Boil the macaroni; put in a pan a layer of macaroni and a layer of
cheese, with plenty of butter, using quarter of a pound of butter for
the dish.

Then pour the stew over the top, and bake fifteen minutes.--_Miss M.
B. B._


TO BOIL HOMINY.

Take two quarts of hominy, wash through several waters until the water
is clear; put it on to boil in a pot half full of water, with a plate
turned down in the bottom of the pot to prevent its burning. Boil for
six hours--do not stir it; when done, take off the vessel and set it
aside in a cool place. When it is ready to fry, put a little lard in
the pan, let it get hot, and mash in the hominy; then add a little
salt. Put it in the pan and press down; let it fry till brown, turning
it upside down on the dish.--_Mrs. P. W._


HOMINY CROQUETTES.

To one cup cold boiled hominy, add two teaspoonfuls melted butter,
and stir it well, adding by degrees one cup milk, till all is made in
a soft light paste; adding one well-beaten egg.

Roll into oval balls with floured hands; dip in beaten egg, then roll
in cracker crumbs and fry in hot lard.--_Mrs. M._


FRIED HOMINY.

Warm the boiled hominy; add a piece of butter, a little salt, half a
pint cream, two eggs, and flour enough to stiffen the mixture. Fry
like mashed potatoes.--_Mrs. E._


TO BOIL HOMINY.

Soak in hot water the overnight. Next morning wash out in two waters
and boil thoroughly. A little milk added to the water whitens and
seasons it.--_Mrs. W._


TO STEW, FRY, OR BROIL MUSHROOMS.

After you have peeled them, sprinkle with salt and pepper and put them
in a stewpan with a little water and lump of butter. Let them boil
fast for ten minutes and stir in a thickening of flour and cream. They
may be broiled on a gridiron, and seasoned with butter. Fry them also
in butter. The large mushrooms are used for the two latter modes of
cooking them.--_Mrs. C. C._


SWEETBREAD AND MUSHROOM PATES.

Ten sweetbreads, parboiled, skinned and all the fat removed; cut into
small pieces. Add one even teaspoonful salt, one can of French
mushrooms. Slice thin, add to juice one teaspoonful salt, one
teaspoonful pepper, one saltspoonful powdered mace, lump of butter
size of guinea egg.

Simmer slowly twenty minutes. Add sweetbreads dredged with one heaping
spoonful corn starch, well mixed in the sweetbread. Let it boil up
once, stirring to prevent sticking. Serve in puff paste shapes, hot. A
little chopped parsley may be added.--_Mrs. R. R._


TO STEW MUSHROOMS.

One pint mushroom buttons, three ounces fresh butter, pepper and salt
to taste, lemon juice, one teaspoonful flour, cream or milk, a little
nutmeg.

Pare the mushrooms, put them into a basin of water with a little lemon
juice. Take them from the water, put into a stewpan, with the above
ingredients. Cover the pan closely and let them stew gently twenty
minutes. If the mushrooms are not perfectly tender, stew them five
minutes longer; remove every particle of butter which may be floating
on top, and serve.--_Mrs. C. C._


BROILED MUSHROOMS.

Cleanse the large mushrooms by wiping with flannel and a little salt.
Cut off stalks and peel the tops; broil them over a clear fire,
turning them once. Arrange on a hot dish. Put a small piece of butter
on each mushroom, season with pepper and salt; squeeze over them a
little lemon juice. Place before the fire, and when the butter is
melted, serve quickly.--_Mrs. C. C._


FONDEE.

     2 ounces butter.
     4 ounces bread crumbs.
     8 ounces cheese.
     1 cup sweet milk.
     3 eggs.

Cut the butter and cheese into small pieces and place them in a large
bowl with the bread; on this pour scalding milk, after which add the
yolks well beaten, also a little salt. Mix well together, cover and
place on the back of the range, stirring occasionally, till all is
dissolved; when add the whites beaten to a stiff froth. Place in a
buttered pie-plate and bake in a quick oven for twenty minutes. Serve
as soon as taken from the stove. Mustard is considered by some an
improvement.--_Mrs. H. H. S._


WELSH RAREBIT.

Cut up cheese fine and place in a saucepan with a little butter, add
one or two spoonfuls beer, and boil till the cheese is well dissolved.
Cut a slice of bread, pour on the cheese; season with pepper, salt,
and catsup.--_Mrs. S._


RICE AND EGG PATES.

Mix cold rice with well-beaten eggs, season with pepper, and salt.

Then cook like scrambled egg; don't let the rice burn.


TONGUE AND PRUNES.

Get a fresh beef tongue, parboil and skin it. Add one pound prunes,
one pound raisins, one-quarter pound sugar, spices to the taste.

Let it stew until perfectly well cooked.

When nearly done, add one lemon.--_Miss M. B. B._


TO STEW DRIED APPLES, PEACHES, QUINCES, OR PEARS.

Take three pounds of dried fruit; wash it in lukewarm water, through
three or four waters, rubbing it hard. Pour on this five quarts
boiling water; boil at least three hours. Just before taking from the
fire, add two teacups nice brown sugar. Do not stir, except
occasionally, to prevent sticking to the bottom. Try to cook the
pieces of fruit separate, except the apples, which run through a
colander and season with nutmeg. The other fruits need no
seasoning.--_Mrs. S. T._


FRIED APPLES.

Slice apples without peeling; cut and fry some thin slices of
breakfast bacon until thoroughly done; remove the slices from the
vessel, adding water to the gravy left. Put in apples and fry until
done, sweetening to taste.--_Mrs. G. B._


SPICED APPLES.

     8 pounds apples pared.
     4 pounds sugar.
     1 quart vinegar.
     1 ounce stick cinnamon,
     1/2 ounce cloves.

Boil the sugar, vinegar, and spices together; put in the apples when
boiling, and let them remain until tender; then take them out and put
them in a jar; boil the syrup down, and pour over them.


STEWED PRUNES.

Immediately after breakfast, wash two pounds prunes in several waters,
rubbing them in the hands.

Put in a preserving kettle with one gallon boiling water. Simmer three
or four hours. Add two teacups light brown sugar and boil till the
syrup is thick. Keep closely covered and do not stir, so each prune
may be stewed whole. Put in a shallow bowl and set to cool. This
amount will make two dishes.

Excellent side dish for winter or spring.--_Mrs. S. T._




EGGS.


Properly cooked, eggs are very wholesome and nutritious diet. Always
be certain, however, that they are fresh, before attempting to make a
dish of them. Some persons use Krepp's family egg-tester, to ascertain
if an egg is sound. Full directions, as to the mode of using it,
accompany the egg tester; so it is unnecessary to give them here. A
simple mode of testing the soundness of an egg, is to put it in water;
and if fresh it will sink to the bottom.


BOILED EGGS.

Let the water be boiling when you put the eggs in it, and let the eggs
boil three minutes after putting them in.--_Mrs. S. T._


SOFT-BOILED EGGS.

Put the eggs in a large tin cup or any tin vessel convenient. Pour
boiling water over them, and let them remain near the fire, five
minutes. Do not let them boil. Eggs cooked thus are slightly jellied
throughout. They can be kept hot without becoming hard.--_Mrs. S. T._


SCRAMBLED EGGS.

Beat four eggs very light. Add a teacup milk, thickened with a
teaspoonful flour. Have the pan very hot, put in a tablespoonful
butter, pour in the eggs, and scramble quickly.--_Mrs. E._


_Scrambled Eggs._

Wash the pan with hot water and soap. Wipe dry. Grease with a little
lard. Break into this the eggs, adding a lump of butter and a little
salt. Stir till done.--_Mrs. B._


EGGS FOR BREAKFAST.

Heat in the oven a common white dish, large enough to hold the number
of eggs to be cooked, allowing plenty of room for each. Melt in it a
small piece of butter, break the eggs, one at a time, carefully in a
saucer, and slip them in the hot dish. Sprinkle over them pepper and
salt, and let them cook four or five minutes. It is a great
improvement to allow to every two eggs a tablespoonful of cream,
adding it when the eggs are first put in.--_Mrs. A. M. D._


EGG CUPS--A BREAKFAST DISH.

Boil some eggs perfectly hard. Halve them, take out the yolks, which
mix smoothly with some finely chopped or ground ham or fowl, salt and
pepper, and a few spoonfuls melted butter or salad oil. Cut a piece
off the bottom of each white half, to make them stand, and fill each
with a chopped mixture. Make a sauce of sweet cream, boiled within an
inner saucepan, and pour over the eggs. Decorate the edges of the dish
with sprigs of curled parsley.--_Mrs. A. M. D._


OMELETTE.

Break six eggs in a pan, beat them well together, add half a gill of
milk, pepper and salt to suit the taste, and a few sprigs of parsley
chopped fine. Beat all well together. Have the cooking-pan hot enough
to brown the butter. Put in half a tablespoonful of butter. Pour the
mixture in the pan or skillet to cook. When sufficiently done, roll
with a spoon and turn into the dish.--_Miss E. P._


_Omelette._

Boil one pint milk in a shallow vessel.

Beat up four eggs very light; add salt, pepper, and a little flour,
making it of the consistency of paste. Put this into the boiling milk.
Have a pan well buttered, into which turn the mixture, and set inside
an oven to bake a light brown. Serve immediately.--_Mrs. J. D._


_Omelette._

     6 eggs beaten very light.
     2 ounces butter.
     Salt and pepper to the taste.
     Chopped parsley or celery.

Fry a light brown in a well buttered pan. Some minced ham or oysters
improve the flavor.--_Mrs. R._


_Omelette._

     4 eggs beaten separately.
     3 tablespoonfuls cream.
     Salt and pepper to the taste.--_Mrs. G. W. P._


OMELETTE SOUFFLE.

Six eggs, whites and yolks beaten separately and very light. Put on
the stove a teacup milk with a piece of butter in it the size of a
walnut. When the butter is melted, mix in one tablespoonful corn
starch. Mix this with the yolks, add salt to the taste, then stir in
slowly the whites. Bake in a buttered pudding dish, fifteen minutes,
in a quick oven.--_Mrs. M. E. L. W._


MOCK OMELETTE.

Two cups bread crumbs soaked all night in one and one-half cup milk.
Add, next morning, three eggs, whites lightly stirred in; pepper, one
teaspoonful salt.--_Mrs. E. W._


HAM OMELETTE.

     1 ounce minced ham.
     A little pepper.
     Eggs beaten very light and fried in lard.--_Miss E. W._


CHEESE OMELETTE.

     3 eggs beaten to a thick froth.
     1/2 teacup grated cracker.
     3 tablespoonfuls grated cheese.

Cook in a frying-pan with butter. Some persons add chopped thyme and
parsley.--_Mrs. P._


GERMAN OMELETTE.

3 eggs (yolks and whites beaten separately).

Mix thoroughly one-half teacup milk and one teaspoonful of flour. Then
add it to the yolks (well beaten) together with a little salt. Pour
this mixture into a moderately hot pan, greased with butter. When this
is nearly done (which will be in about five minutes), add the whites,
stiffly frothed and slightly salted, spreading them over the whole
surface. Run a knife carefully around the edges, and turn into a
heated dish when done. It is an improvement to mix one-third of the
frothed whites with the yolks before pouring into the pan.--_Mrs. M.
C. C._


POACHED EGGS.

Let the eggs be perfectly fresh, and the pan at least two inches deep
in boiling water. Break the eggs carefully, just over the water or in
a spoon, so that they may be slipped into the water with their shape
preserved. Take them up in a large perforated spoon, cover with fresh
melted butter and sprinkle with salt--never pepper, as some persons do
not use it, and it mars the appearance of the dish.--_Mrs. S. T._


EGGS WITH TOAST. (_A Spring Dish._)

Cut bread in squares, and toast a light brown. Poach eggs nicely,
place each one on a piece of toast. Pour melted butter over them, and
serve.--_Mrs. S. T._


RUMBLE EGGS.

Beat up three eggs with two ounces fresh butter or well washed salt
butter. Add a teaspoonful cream or new milk. Put all in a saucepan and
stir over the fire five minutes. When, it rises up, dish it
immediately on toast.--_Mrs. S._


HAM AND EGGS.

Slice the ham rather thick. Fry in a hot pan. Before it becomes hard,
take from the pan and lay in a dish over a vessel of hot water.

Let the pan remain on the fire, so as to keep the ham gravy hot, that
it may cook the eggs nicely when dropped into it. Break the eggs
carefully, drop them in whole, and do not let them touch each other.
Cook a light brown, not allowing the yolks to get hard. Lay an egg on
each slice of meat.--_Mrs. S. T._


HAM AND EGG PUDDING. (_A Spring Dish._)

     6 eggs beaten very light.
     A light pint of flour.
     A pint of milk.
     A small piece of butter.
     Salt and pepper to the taste.

Sprinkle some slices of boiled ham (both fat and lean) with pepper,
and lay them across a deep dish that has been greased. Then pour the
pudding batter over the bacon and bake quickly. _Mrs. V. P. M._


EGGS A LA CREME.

Six eggs boiled hard and chopped fine, and stale bread. Put in a dish
alternate layers of chopped egg and grated bread. When the dish is
full, pour on one pint boiling milk seasoned with salt, pepper, and
one tablespoonful butter. Bake a light brown.--_Miss N._


BAKED EGGS FOR DINNER.

Have ready eight or ten hard-boiled eggs, a cup of light grated bread
crumbs, butter, pepper and salt. Place in a buttered pudding dish a
layer of sliced eggs, dotted with bits of butter, and sprinkled with
salt and pepper; next a layer of bread crumbs, and so on to the top,
being careful to let the top layer be of bread crumbs.--_Mrs. A. M.
D._


EGG PIE.

Take six hard-boiled eggs, slice, season with salt, pepper, and
butter, bake in a paste, top and bottom.


STUFFED EGGS.

Boil six eggs very hard. Peel them, and after having sliced a bit off
of each end to make them stand well, cut in halves and extract the
yolks. Rub up the yolks with a pinch of pepper and salt, melted
butter, bread crumbs, and finely chopped celery. Fill in the whites
nicely, stand on end in the pan, lay bits of butter on each egg and
bake.--_Mrs. D. P._




VEGETABLES.


If possible, use vegetables gathered early in the morning, with the
dew on them. It is even better to gather them late the evening before,
with the evening dew on them (setting them in the ice-house or some
cool place), than to gather them after the morning sun has grown hot.
If you are living in the city, get your vegetables from market as
early in the morning as possible.

As soon as gathered or brought from market, all vegetables should be
carefully picked over, washed, placed in fresh water, and set in a
cool place till the cook is ready to put them on for dinner.

Put them on in water neither cold nor boiling hot. The slow heating
that takes place when you put them on in cold water deprives them of
their flavor, to some extent, whilst too rapid heating toughens the
vegetable fibre.

Just before they are thoroughly done and tender, add sufficient salt
to season them. Do not stir them and mutilate them with a spoon, but
turn them into a colander and drain. Place them in a hot dish and put
a large tablespoonful of fresh butter over them.

In cooking dried peas and beans, as well as corn, put up in brine,
always soak them the overnight. These vegetables should first be
parboiled, whether they are to be used for soup or for side dishes.


TO BOIL GREEN PEAS.

Early in the morning, either buy the peas from market or have them
gathered in your garden, while the dew is on them. Shell and lay in
cold water till half an hour before dinner. Then put in boiling water
and boil steadily a half hour. Add a little salt, just before taking
from the fire. Drain, add a heaping tablespoonful fresh butter and put
in a covered dish.--_Mrs. S. T._


TO COOK ASPARAGUS.

As soon as you get the asparagus from market or your garden, throw
into salt and water, after scraping the outer skin and tying up in
bunches. Put on to boil one hour before dinner. After boiling thirty
minutes, drain, cut in pieces half an inch long, and put in the
saucepan with enough milk to cover them. Just before serving, add one
tablespoonful fresh butter, in which one teaspoonful flour has been
rubbed. Season with salt and pepper.--_Mrs. S. T._


_To Cook Asparagus._

Wash well, scrape, cut off the tough end, tie up in bunches and put in
boiling water with a spoonful of salt. Boil thirty minutes or till
tender. Lay it on slices of toast in a dish, pour melted butter over
it, and serve hot.--_Mrs. P. W._


TO BOIL BEETS.

Wash them. Do not break or cut the roots. Leave an inch of the tops,
so that the color and juice cannot escape. Boil hard for two hours.
When tender, slice them, sprinkling over them sugar, then butter and
salt to the taste. Sugar is the greatest improvement.--_Mrs. S. T._


TO BAKE ONIONS.

Boil six onions in water, or milk and water with a seasoning of pepper
and salt. When done enough to mash, take them off, mash them with
butter, grate bread crumbs over them and set them to bake. Or place
them whole in the baking dish with butter and bread crumbs.


TO COOK ONIONS.

Boil till tender, in milk and water. Pour melted butter over them, and
serve; or chop up and stew with a little milk, butter, and salt.


TO FRY ONIONS.

Wash and slice them. Chop fine, put in a frying-pan and cover with
water. Simmer till the water is dried up, then fry brown, with a
large slice of fat pork. Add pepper and salt.--_Mrs. S. T._


TO DRESS RAW ONIONS.

Slice and chop fine, and put in weak salt and water till just before
dinner. Then drain off and dress with half a teacup vinegar, two
tablespoonfuls pepper vinegar, two tablespoonfuls made mustard, two
tablespoonfuls white sugar, one tablespoonful salt.

Lay a large lump of ice on top, and garnish with curled parsley;
which, eaten after onions, is said to remove the scent from the

CORN PUT UP IN BRINE.

use. Strip off the outer shuck, leaving the inner, silky ones next to
the grain. Have ready a nice clean wooden firkin or tub, properly
scalded and sunned. Sprinkle salt over the bottom. Pack closely with
corn. Wash a large flat rock and lay on the top, when nearly full.
Pour strong brine over the corn, covering it well. The day before
using, strip off the shuck and silk, place in a bucket of cold water
(renewing the water once, or twice), and let it stand till ready to
use it. Two ears soaked thus, and shaved into a pot of soup with other
vegetables, will impart a delicious flavor.--_Mrs. S. T._




PICKLES AND CATSUPS.

For pickles and catsups, use the best cider vinegar, it being not only
more wholesome than other kinds of vinegar, but the only sort that
will keep pickles or catsup for any length of time.

In making catsup, or in scalding pickles in vinegar, if a brass kettle
is used, it must be scoured with sand and ashes, washed and wiped dry,
and then scoured with vinegar and salt. By attending to these
directions, the brass kettle may be safely used--though the pickles or
catsup must be poured from it the instant it is taken from the fire,
or they will canker.

In making pickles, it is a good rule to allow two pounds of sugar to
each gallon of vinegar for sour pickle, though a larger proportion
must be allowed for sweet pickle.

Vinegar for pickling should be spiced and set to sun from spring to
autumn. Never put pickle in a jar that has been used for butter or
lard. Examine often to see if the pickle is well covered with vinegar,
and if any of it has turned soft, remove it. Keep it in a dry, airy
closet, and be careful not to let it freeze. Pickle is generally
considered best when from six months to a year old. Some housekeepers
use the same vinegar (with a slight addition) from year to year, by
draining the pickle as they take it out of the jar.

Cucumbers (sliced), snaps, gherkins, muskmelons, cabbage, onions, or
anything to be put into the spiced vinegar, must be previously boiled
tender in strong vinegar and salt--well pressed out--and then put into
the pickle vinegar, will soon be ready for use.--_Mrs. J. J. C._

PREPARING PICKLES.

Vegetables for pickle should be kept in cold and strong brine till
they turn yellow: then put vine-leaves in the bottom of the kettle,
then a layer of vegetables and a layer of leaves till full. Pour on
them, boiling salt and water and let them boil until a bright green.
Take them, while hot, and place in weak vinegar for a whole week. Then
add them to the spiced vinegar. Afterwards rub on them a little
turmeric. Prepare the spiced vinegar in May, and expose to the sun
every day for some time.--_Mrs. R._


YELLOW PICKLE.

     2 gallons vinegar.
     2 pounds sugar.
     1 ounce turmeric.
     3 ounces allspice.
     1 ounce cloves.
     1 ounce mace.
     1 pint mustard-seed.
     2 tablespoonfuls celery-seed.

Pound all together and stir into the hot cider vinegar for several
minutes. Prepare your vegetables by quartering the cabbage and
scalding them in brine; cover them and leave until cold; squeeze dry
and hang in the sun; when bleached, throw in plain vinegar, then into
the spiced vinegar.--_Mrs. P._


_Yellow Pickle._

     21/2 gallons vinegar.
     7 pounds sugar.
     1 pound white mustard-seed.
     1 bottle mustard.
     1 pound white ginger.
     1/2 pound white pepper.
     1/2 pound turmeric.
     2 ounces nutmeg.
     2 ounces allspice.
     2 ounces cloves.
     2 ounces celery-seed.

Pound them all before putting in the vinegar, add one pound scraped
horseradish, half-dozen lemons sliced.

Scald two dozen onions, sprinkle them with salt, and let them stand a
day; drain off the water and wash well with the vinegar. Add them to
your spiced vinegar. Cut your cabbage and scald them in strong salt
water till you can run a straw through them; drain them for a day and
put into plain vinegar for two weeks; let them drain again a day or
two before putting into the prepared vinegar. Put two tablespoonfuls
turmeric in the plain vinegar to turn the cabbage yellow.--_Mrs. J. T.
A._


_Yellow Pickle._

One peck cabbage cut up. Lay in a jar, sprinkling with salt; leave it
twenty-four hours; squeeze out and put in a kettle with half a dozen
onions chopped, cover with vinegar, add one ounce turmeric, and boil
one hour. Then add:

     2 pounds brown sugar.
     1/2 ounce mace.
     1/2 ounce allspice.
     1/2 ounce cloves.
     4 tablespoonfuls mixed mustard.
     1 teacup black peppercorn.

_Yellow Pickle._

     2 gallons cider vinegar.
     4 ounces beaten white pepper.
     4 ounces whole allspice.
     4 ounces white mustard-seed.
     4 ounces black mustard-seed.
     2 ounces mace.
     2 ounces turmeric.
     2 ounces white ginger.
     2 ounces ground mustard.
     3 ounces garlic.
     3 ounces horseradish.
     2 gills celery-seed.
     4 sliced lemons.
     5 pounds brown sugar.

Should be prepared months before using. Cabbage to be pickled should
be boiled or scalded in salt and water until the leaves can be turned
back so as to sprinkle salt between them; then must be dried in the
sun. Shake all the salt out when dry, and soak in plain vinegar, with
a little turmeric sprinkled on each layer of cabbage. After ten days,
drain them and put in the spiced vinegar.--_Mrs. S. T._


YELLOW PICKLED CABBAGE.

     1 ounce turmeric.
     1 gill black pepper.
     1 gill celery-seed.
     A few cloves.
     A few pieces of ginger.
     4 tablespoonfuls made mustard.
     1/2 ounce mace.
     2 pounds sugar.
     1 tablespoonful allspice.

Take one peck of quartered cabbage; slice them and put a layer of
cabbage and one of salt; let it remain over night. In the morning
squeeze them and put on the fire with four chopped onions, and cover
with vinegar; boil for an hour, then add the spices mentioned above,
and let it boil an hour longer; when cold it is ready for use.--_Mrs.
W. H. M._


A QUICK WAY TO MAKE YELLOW PICKLE.

Two gallons chopped cabbage, sprinkle one handful salt through it, and
let stand over night. Squeeze it out dry and put into a kettle. Add
one ounce of celery-seed, one ounce of turmeric, one quarter-pound of
mustard-seed, (black and white mixed), five pounds brown sugar, with
vinegar enough to cover the whole well.

Boil until the cabbage is tender. Put it in stone jars and keep it
closely covered. It is fit for use the day after it is made.--_Mrs. J.
C. W._


YELLOW PICKLE.

     2 ounces black mustard-seed.
     2 ounces white mustard-seed.
     2 ounces celery-seed.
     1 ounce coriander.
     1 ounce white pepper.
     1 ounce green ginger.
     2 ounces turmeric.
     1 pound brown sugar.

Put these in one and one-half gallons best cider vinegar, and set in
the sun. This can be prepared during the winter, if you choose.
Quarter your cabbages (small heads about the size of a large apple are
best), and put in a tub. Make a strong brine, boil and pour over
while hot. Let them stand twenty-four hours and then repeat. On the
third day spread them on a board or table, salt them slightly, and let
them stand in the hot sun four days, taking care that no dew shall
fall on them. Put in a jar, and pour on your prepared vinegar boiling
hot. This pickle will not be ready for the table till it has softened
and absorbed the vinegar. You can judge of this by your taste. To make
quick pickle by this recipe, you simply salt your cabbage for one
night, pouring off in the morning the water drawn out by the salt.
Then put in the kettle with the spices and vinegar, and boil until a
straw will go through.--_Mrs. J. B. D._


CABBAGE PICKLE FOR PRESENT USE.

Boil the cabbage in salt and water till tender; lay them on dishes,
drain or press them in a towel.

Boil together two gallons strong vinegar.

     1 pint white mustard-seed.
     4 ounces ginger.
     3 ounces black pepper.
     3 ounces allspice.
     1 ounce mace.
     1 ounce cloves.
     1 ounce turmeric.
     1 large handful horseradish.
     1 large handful garlic.
     1 ounce celery-seed.
     2 pounds brown sugar.

Pour it over the cabbage boiling hot. If you have no garlic, use one
pint onions chopped fine.--_Mrs. H._


CUT CABBAGE PICKLE.

Fill the jar with cut cabbage. To every gallon of cabbage put one
handful horseradish.

     3 tablespoonfuls black pepper.
     1/2 tablespoonful red pepper.
     3 tablespoonfuls coriander-seed.
     3 tablespoonfuls celery-seed.
     2 tablespoonfuls mace.
     2 tablespoonfuls allspice.
     1 dozen cloves.
     1/2 teacup made mustard.
     4 tablespoonfuls white mustard-seed.
     1 pound sugar.
     4 or 5 sliced onions.

Salt your cabbage first as for slaw, and let it stand two or three
hours. Put in a porcelain kettle and cover with weak vinegar; put
turmeric enough to color, boil it till tender, then drain off the weak
vinegar, and cover it with strong cider vinegar, and mix the spices
well through it; add three or more tablespoonfuls turmeric, and boil
the whole fifteen minutes very hard. When cold, it is ready for
use.--_Mrs. S. M._


CHOPPED CABBAGE PICKLE.

Cut the cabbage as for slaw, pour over it enough boiling brine to
cover it. Chop and scald a few onions in the same way, cover both, and
leave twenty-four hours; then squeeze in a cloth until free from
brine. If it should taste very salt, soak in clear water for a few
hours and squeeze again. Loosen and mix the cabbage and onions
thoroughly. To one-half gallon cabbage put:

     1 small cut onion.
     1 pound brown sugar.
     1 small box mustard.
     1/2 pound white mustard-seed.
     1 small cup grated horseradish.
     1/2 ounce mace.
     1 tablespoonful ground black pepper.
     2 ounces celery-seed.
     1 ounce turmeric.

Chopped celery and nasturtiums, if they can be had. Mix all, and
cover with cold vinegar. If necessary, add more vinegar after it has
stood awhile.--_Mrs. C. N._


GREEN PICKLE.

Put the pickles in a strong brine, strong enough to bear an egg. Three
weeks is long enough for them to remain in brine, if you wish to make
your pickle early in the fall; but they will keep several months,
indeed all the winter, by having them always well covered with the
brine.

When ready to make your pickle, drain off _every drop_ of brine, and
pour boiling water over the pickles. Repeat this for three mornings in
succession. Then pour off this last water, and soak the pickles two
days in cold water, changing the water each morning. Next, pouring off
this water, scald the pickles _three_ mornings in weak vinegar,
weakening the vinegar by putting two quarts of water to one of
vinegar. This is the time for greening the pickles, by putting in the
jar or keg a layer of pickle, then sprinkling in a little powdered
alum, and so on, till the vessel is filled; then pouring on the
weakened vinegar. Only use the alum the first morning; but the other
mornings pour off the vinegar and pour on a fresh quantity. All this
is necessary, if you wish to have pickle perfectly free from the
brine, and in a condition to keep. Fill your jars with the pickle thus
prepared, and pour over them the best of vinegar, after seasoning it
and letting it boil a few minutes. Seasoning to one gallon vinegar:

     3 pounds brown sugar.
     1 tablespoonful allspice.
     1 tablespoonful of cinnamon.
     1 tablespoonful of ginger.
     1 tablespoonful of black pepper, all pounded.
     20 drops oil of cloves, or 3 ounces of cloves.
     1 ounce celery-seed.
     1 pod red pepper.
     2 tablespoonfuls grated horseradish.--_Mrs. C._


_Green Pickles._

Put the pickle in strong brine for two days; then boil the brine and
pour it over them hot. Repeat this twice. Then pour over them boiling
vinegar and water mixed, three successive times, at intervals of two
days. For a three-gallon jar take:

     1 teacup black pepper.
     1 teacup allspice.
     1/2 teacup of ginger.
     1/2 teacup of mace.
     1/2 teacup of cloves, all beaten, but not fine.
     2 heads of cabbage chopped fine.
     2 teacups horseradish.
     8 onions chopped fine.
     1 quart mustard seed.

Take half of the beaten spices and mix with the latter ingredients,
also three cups of brown sugar; stuff the mangoes with this. Add the
rest to the vinegar with five pounds of sugar, and pour on the pickle
hot.

This makes very superior pickle.--_Miss S. S. V._


_Green Pickle_ [_3 gallons_].

     2 ounces mace.
     1/2 pound ginger, scalded and sliced.
     2 ounces cloves.
     2 ounces cinnamon.
     2 ounces long pepper.
     2 ounces black pepper.
     2 ounces allspice.
     1 ounce nutmeg.
     1/4 pound horseradish scraped, sliced, but not _dried_.
     1 ounce turmeric.
     4 ounces black mustard-seed.
     1 ounce coriander-seed.
     2 ounces garlic, or onion.
     2 pounds brown sugar.

Prepare the cucumbers as follows: gather cucumbers, snaps, etc., and
put them in a large stone jar, pouring over them a strong brine which
has been boiled and skimmed--hot, but not boiling; cover with an old
table-cloth to keep the steam in. Let them stand about a week, then
take and soak twenty-four hours in cold water. Next put them in a
large kettle lined with grape leaves, and fill, covering with weak
vinegar. Sprinkle in a dessertspoonful of powdered alum, and cover
with grape leaves, setting on the stove until a beautiful bright
green. Put in a jar and pour this vinegar over them and let them stand
until next day; then dry the pickles with a cloth, and have ready the
jar, putting in a layer of the pickles with a layer of the seasoning
before mentioned; fill with strong cider vinegar. Tie up closely, and
keep in a warm, dry place.

The spices must be bruised or beaten tolerately fine before putting
with pickles; and a little salad oil added is an improvement.--_Mrs.
P. McG._

black pepper, about two ounces to seventy-five cucumbers. Add
celery-seed, and onion chopped fine.

Take a large stone jar, put a layer of cucumber and a layer of the
mixture, with plenty of brown sugar (about eight pounds to a large
jar). In this way fill the jar, then cover it with strong vinegar: tie
the mouth up securely, put the jar in a pot of cold water, and boil
until the cucumber is tender, and they will be ready for use in a few
days.--_Mrs. C. C. McP._


PICKLED CUCUMBERS.

Put them in a wooden or stone vessel, pour over strong salt and water

cold water; next day put them over the fire, but do not let them boil,
allowing one tablespoonful alum to one gallon vinegar; mace, cinnamon,
peppercorns, white and black mustard-seed and grated horseradish, one
tablespoonful each to every gallon vinegar, and one teaspoonful
turmeric, and two and one-half pounds sugar. Fold a double piece of

allspice; set the jar in the kettle of water, and boil four hours,
then pour the liquor through a fine sieve, and boil until it is
reduced one-half.

for use. It will flavor very pleasantly with celery.--_Mrs. Dr. J._


_Celery Vinegar._

Take two gills celery-seed, pound and put it in a celery bottle, and
fill it with sharp vinegar. Shake it every day for two weeks; then
strain it, and keep it for use. It will impart an agreeable flavor to
everything in which celery is used. Mint and thyme may be prepared in
the same way, using vinegar or brandy. The herbs should not remain in
the liquid more than twenty-four hours. They should be placed in a
jar--a handful is enough, and the vinegar or brandy poured over them;
take out the herbs next day, and put in fresh. Do this for three days;
then strain, cork, and seal.--_Mrs. R._

boiled with it. Bottle and cork tightly.--_Mrs. G. N._


CAPER SAUCE.

Stir in melted butter two large tablespoonfuls capers, a little

substitutes for the capers. For boiled mutton.--_Mrs. R._


_Caper Sauce._

To one cup drawn butter add three tablespoonfuls green pickled capers.
If prepared for boiled mutton, use half teacupful of the water in

Take two small cucumber pickles, two full teaspoonfuls capers, three
small sprigs parsley, and one small shallot or leek. Chop all fine,

mass. Add a little vinegar. Chop very fine two small cucumber pickles,
two teaspoonfuls capers, two sprigs parsley, one leek or small onion,
and a little celery; stir all into the dressing. This is delicious
with boiled fish, either hot or cold--also cold meats, chicken or
turkey.--_Mrs. S._

CAKE.


Before commencing to make cake, be sure that you have all the
ingredients in the house, and all the implements at hand, such as
trays, bowls, large dishes, large strong iron spoons, egg-beaters,
etc.

Use none but the best family flour in making cake. It is a good plan
to sift it before weighing or measuring it, and to let it air and sun
several hours before using it; as this makes it much lighter.

It is a great mistake to set aside rancid or indifferent butter for
cake-making. The butter used for the purpose should be good and fresh.

Always use granulated sugar or else powdered loaf or cut sugar; as
pulverized sugar is apt to have plaster of Paris or other foreign
elements in it. Never use brown or even clarified sugar in
cake-making, unless it be for gingerbread.

Do not attempt to make cake without fresh eggs. Cream of tartar, soda
and yeast powders are poor substitutes for these.

A fresh egg placed in water will sink to the bottom.

In breaking eggs, do not break them over the vessels in which they are
to be beaten. Break them, one by one, over a saucer, so that if you
come across a defective one, you will not spoil the rest by mixing it
with them; whereas, if it is a good one, it will be easy to pour the
white from the saucer into the bowl with the rest of the whites, and
to add the yolk which you retain in the egg-shell to the other yolks.

The Dover egg-beater saves much time and trouble in beating eggs and
will beat the yolks into as stiff a froth as the whites. It is well to
have two egg-beaters, one for the yolks and the other for the whites.
Eggs well beaten ought to be as stiff as batter. Cool the dishes that
you are to use in beating eggs. In summer, keep the eggs on ice before
using them, and always try to make the cake before breakfast, or as
early in the morning as possible.

Some of the best housewives think it advisable to cream the butter and
flour together, and add the sugar to the yolks when these are whipped
to a stiff froth, as it produces yellow specks when you add the sugar
sooner. The whites must always be added last.

In making fruit cake, prepare the fruit the day before. In winter
time, this may be easily and pleasantly done after tea. It requires a
longer time to bake fruit cake, than plain. Every housekeeper should
have a close cake-box in which to put cake after cooling it and
wrapping it in a thick napkin.

Take three pounds cut or best quality of loaf sugar, dissolve it in a
small quantity of water, boil to candy height or until it ropes. Have
ready the whites of thirteen eggs well beaten. When the sugar is
boiled sufficiently, pour it into a deep bowl, occasionally stirring
it gently, until you can just bear your finger in it; then add the
beaten egg all at once, beating it very hard for half an hour, when it
is ready for use. Strain into the icing the juice of one lemon into
which the peel has been grated, for half an hour.--_Mrs. F C. W._


ICING.

Break into a dish the whites of four eggs. Whip in by degrees one and
one-quarter pound of the finest loaf sugar, powdered and sifted. Beat
till stiff and smooth, then add the strained juice of a large lemon
with a few drops of oil of lemon, and beat again; in all beat half an
hour. If too stiff add a little more white of egg. Some persons put it
on with a knife, but it is far smoother and more evenly spread over
the cake if put on with a large spoon. Dip up a spoonful of the icing
and pour it from the spoon over the cake. Pour it over the top of the
cake and it will diffuse itself down the sides. To color icing yellow,
steep the rind of an orange or lemon in the lemon juice before
straining it into the icing. To make it pink, put in strawberry or
cranberry juice with the lemon juice.--_Mrs. S. T._

all well together. Dissolve one teaspoonful soda and three-quarters
teaspoonful tartaric acid in a little cream. First mix the soda with
the dough, then the acid. Season with mace or wine. They will rise
very much.--_Mrs. D._

Shrewsbury cakes. Beat the whites of three eggs to a strong froth;
weigh one pound of the best "A" sugar, put it in a tin can with three
wine-glasses of water. Let it boil slowly, till it begins to rope, or
rather, when a little of it will cool on a plate, like it would begin
to candy. Then pour the boiling sugar gradually to the white of egg;
beat it well till it begins to thicken and to cool somewhat, then beat
into the icing two tablespoonfuls of powdered cinnamon, and ice over
the little cakes, using a stiff feather for the purpose. You can add
the other unbeaten whites of eggs, with an addition of sugar, to make

PUDDINGS.


The directions given for cake apply likewise to puddings. Always beat
the whites and yolks of the eggs separately and very light, and add
the whites just before baking or boiling. All puddings (except those
risen with yeast), should be baked immediately after the ingredients
are mixed. Thick yellow earthenware dishes are better than tin for
baking puddings, on several accounts. One is that the pudding, to be
good, must be baked principally from the bottom, and tin burns more
easily than earthenware. Another reason is, that the acids employed in
some puddings corrode and discolor tin. Garnish the pudding with
sifted white sugar, and with candied or preserved orange or lemon
peel.

In boiling a pudding, cold water should never be added. Keep a kettle
of hot water to replenish the water in the pot as it boils away. As
soon as the pudding is done, remove it from the boiling water. A
decrease in heat whilst cooking, makes boiled pudding sodden, and
makes baked pudding fall. The best sauce for a boiled pudding is cold
sauce made of the frothed whites of eggs, butter, sugar, nutmeg, and a
little French brandy, while for a baked pudding, a rich, boiled wine
sauce is best.


PLUM PUDDING.

     3 dozen eggs.
     3 pounds baker's bread, stale, and grated fine.
     3 pounds suet.
     3 pounds brown sugar.
     1 pound sliced citron.
     3 pounds currants.
     4 pounds seeded raisins.
     1/2 ounce nutmeg, and the same of mace, cloves, and cinnamon.
     Half pint wine.
     Half pint French cooking brandy.

Mix and divide into six parts. Tie each part in a twilled cotton
cloth, put them in boiling water, and let them boil four hours. Then
hang them in the air to dry a day or two. Keep them in a cool, dry
place.

When you wish to use one, it must be boiled an hour before dinner.
Serve with rich sauce. It will keep six months or a year.--_Mrs. T. M.
C._


_Plum Pudding._

     10 eggs.
     1 pound chopped suet.
     1 pound seeded raisins.
     1 pound currants.
     1 pound stale bread crumbs.
     1/2 pound citron.
     1 nutmeg.
     1 wine-glassful wine.
     1 wine-glassful brandy.
     1/2 pound brown sugar.

Beat the eggs light, add the sugar and spices, stir in the suet and
bread crumbs, add the fruit by degrees, then the wine and brandy. Pour
into a well-floured bag, leaving a third as much room as the mixture
occupies, for swelling. Put into a pot of boiling water and boil four
hours. Dip the bag into cold water when ready to turn out the pudding,
to prevent it from sticking.--_Mrs. E. B._


_Plum Pudding._

At sunrise, sift a quart of the best flour; rub into it an Irish
potato mashed, free from lumps. Put in it a teaspoonful of salt, and a
half teacup of yeast. Add six eggs, beaten separately, and enough
water to make a soft dough. Knead half an hour without intermission.
In winter, set it in a warm place, in summer set it in a cool place to
rise. If dinner is wanted at two o'clock, knead into this at one
o'clock, half pound of butter, two pounds of stoned raisins, cut up,
and a grated nutmeg. Work very little, just enough to mix. Wet a thick
cloth, flour it and tie it loosely that the pudding may have room to
rise. Put it in a kettle of milk-warm water, heating slowly until it
boils. Boil one hour. Serve with wine sauce.--_Mrs. S. T._


RICH PLUM PUDDING.

Nine eggs beaten to a froth.

Add flour sufficient to make a thick batter, free from lumps. Then add
one pint of new milk and beat well. Afterwards add the following
ingredients, in small quantities at a time, keeping it well stirred.

Two pounds stoned raisins, two pounds currants, well washed, picked,
and dried. One-quarter pound bitter almonds, blanched and divided;
three-quarters pound brown sugar; three-quarters pound beef suet,
chopped fine; one nutmeg, grated fine; one teaspoonful of ground
allspice, the same of mace and cinnamon.

This pudding should be mixed several days before cooking, then well
beaten, and more milk should be added, if required. Make this into two
puddings, put in cotton bags and boil four hours. By changing the
bags, and hanging in a cool, dry place, they will keep six months and
be the better for it. Steam and serve with sauce made as follows:

One cup of sugar, one of butter. Beat well together. Break an egg in
and mix well. Add a tablespoonful of wine or brandy, and serve
immediately.--_Mrs. F._

When ready to boil, wet the above with ten eggs, well beaten, two
wine-glasses of wine and the same of brandy. Grate the rinds of two
lemons, pare and chop them and beat all well together. Then dip a
strong cloth in boiling water and wring it dry. Lay it on a waiter,
greasing well with butter. Put it in a large bowl and pour the pudding
in, putting two sticks in the cloth across each other, and tying below
the sticks. Have the water boiling and throw in the pudding as soon as
tied. Put a plate at the bottom of the pot and boil four hours.--_Mrs.
Dr. S._

ORIGINAL PUDDING.

Reserve a portion of light dough intended for breakfast. Set it in a
cool place, and four hours before dinner, roll thin, without kneading.
Sprinkle thickly over it, first, a layer of sliced citron, then a
layer of seeded raisins. Roll up and lay on a buttered bread-pan till
very light. Then either boil in a cloth, prepared by wetting first and
then flouring (the pudding being allowed room for rising in this
cloth), or set the pan in the stove and bake. In the latter case,
after it becomes a light brown, it must be covered with a buttered
paper.

PASTRY.


Pastry has fallen somewhat into disfavor, on account of its
unwholesome properties, but as many persons still use it, we will give
some directions for making it as wholesome and palatable as possible.

It is a great mistake to use what is called "cooking butter" and old
lard for pastry. Only fresh butter and sweet lard should be employed
for the purpose, and in summer these should be placed on ice before
being used for pastry. Pastry, like cake, should be made in the cool
of the morning, and it should be eaten fresh, as, unlike cake, it will
not admit of being kept.

If a marble slab cannot be obtained, it is well to keep a thick wooden
board exclusively for rolling out pastry. Handle as little as
possible, and if anything should prevent you from putting it on to
bake as soon as it is rolled out, put it on ice in the interim, as
this will make it nicer and more flaky. Sometimes there is a delay
about getting the oven or fire ready, in which case the cook generally
leaves the pastry lying on the kitchen table; but its quality would be
much improved if it were put on the ice instead, whilst waiting to be
baked.


EXCELLENT RECIPE FOR PASTRY.

Four teacups flour, one teacup firm butter, one teacup nice lard, one
teacup ice water, one teaspoonful salt. Mix the lard and butter in the
flour with a large, flat knife, then add the ice water. Do not touch
it with the hands. Take it up in a rough-looking mass, roll it out
quickly--not too thin. Cut it with a very sharp knife around the edges
of the patty-pans. When intending to bake lemon puddings or
cheese-cakes, let the pastry bake four or five minutes before adding
butter, as this prevents the pastry from being heavy at the bottom. In
summer it is best to put five teacups of flour, instead of
four.--_Mrs. M. C. C._


PASTRY.

One pound fresh butter, one quart flour. Make up the dough with ice
water. Divide the butter into parts. Roll out, and cover thickly with
one part of the butter. Continue till all is rolled, sifting flour
each time. Don't handle much, or it will be heavy.--_Mrs. W._


_Pastry._

Mix with water one quart flour and two teaspoonfuls salt. Work well
and roll out thin. Spread over with lard, sift flour over the dough,
and cut it in strips of two inches. Lay them in a pile one above
another, cut them in squares, and again pile them up. Press down with
the hands, and roll out thin as before. Repeat this several times, and
the pastry will be improved each time. Do not use your hands after the
roller is applied.


PUFF PASTE.

One pound flour, to be made up with cold water and beaten fifteen
minutes. One pound butter (or half lard, if you have not enough
butter), which must be spread on the dough four times and rolled in.

It must be made thin, put in tins, and baked in a moderate oven.


LEMON PIE.

Grate the rind and squeeze the juice of two lemons. Stir two
tablespoonfuls corn-starch into two teacups hot water, and boil,
stirring well. Add three-quarters of a pound of granulated sugar. When
cool, add the yolks of four eggs well beaten, then the lemon-juice and
grated rind, stirring the whole well together. Line the plates with
rich pastry, and pour the mixture in. Bake until the crust is done.
Beat the whites of the eggs very light, add six ounces powdered sugar,
pour over the pies, set them again in the oven, and slightly brown.
This will make two pies.--_Mrs. T. M. C._


_Lemon Pie._

One cupful sugar, one cupful sweet milk, one tablespoonful flour, one
tablespoonful butter, three eggs, one lemon. Mix the grated rind and

cold, spread on the whites of the eggs, frothed and sweetened.--_Mrs.
McG._

whites of the three eggs, stiffly frothed and sweetened. Then set it
again on the fire, to brown slightly.--_Mrs. McG._

shallow tin pie-plates. Grate nutmeg on each one and pile up three or
four deep.--_Mrs. S. T._


_Apple Pie._

butter over all. Dredge again. Cover with paste and bake. A glass of
brandy or wine will improve it.--_Mrs. S. T._

cake-cutter, place over the fruit and bake.--_Mrs. S. T._


SLICED POTATO PIE.

Steam or boil the potatoes. Slice and lay in a syrup of sugar seasoned
with whole cloves or allspice. Scald and set aside till nearly cool.
Then place the slices evenly on the bottom of a deep pie-plate lined
with crust. Put in each pie a tablespoonful of butter in bits, a
wine-glass of brandy or Madeira wine.--_Mrs. S. T._


SWEET POTATO PIE.

One pint potatoes, boiled and mashed with a teacup sweet milk, and run
through a colander. Beat separately four eggs; cream one teacup butter
with one of sugar. Beat in the yolks, then the potatoes, grate in half
a nutmeg, pour in a large wine-glass of brandy or good whiskey, and

FRENCH FRITTERS.

One quart of milk (half to be boiled, and the other half mixed with a
quart of flour, and used to thicken the boiling milk with).

Let it get done. While cooking, beat ten eggs very light; add a
spoonful at a time to the batter, beating all the time, till well
mixed. Add salt to your taste. Have a small oven full of nice lard,
boiling hot. Put not quite a spoonful of batter to each fritter. Take
them out before they turn dark and put them in a colander to drain the
lard off of them.--_Mrs. Dr. E._


FRITTERS (_made with yeast_).

One quart flour, three tablespoonfuls yeast, five eggs, one pint milk.
Beat into a tolerably stiff batter. Stir a cupful of boiled rice into
the batter, a short time before baking. A good deal of lard (boiling
hot) is required for frying the fritters. Drop the batter in with a
spoon, which must be dipped, each time, in boiling water. In cool
weather, make the fritters about nine in the morning, in the summer,
about eleven.--_Mrs. A. C._


BELL FRITTERS.

Put a pint of boiling water in a preserving kettle, and as it boils,
put in a tablespoonful of fresh butter. Have ready a pint of the best
flour, sifted and wet with cold water, as for starch. Dip up some of
the boiling water and pour to this, being careful to have it smooth.
Return this to the kettle, stirring rapidly to prevent lumps. Turn
into a wooden tray, and while hot, beat in six well beaten eggs, a
spoonful at a time. Beat till very light, and beat quickly that the
eggs may not cook in lumps. Have ready a pint of boiling lard in a
pan. Make the fritters the shape of an egg, drop in and fry a light
brown.

To be eaten with a pint of molasses, a heaping tablespoonful of
butter, a little ginger and cinnamon, boiled to a thick syrup and
served hot.

Eight eggs, four tablespoonfuls flour, one pint of milk, one
teaspoonful salt.




JELLY, BLANC-MANGE, CHARLOTTE RUSSE, BAKED CUSTARD, CREAMS, ETC.


Jelly made of the feet of calves, hogs, etc., is more troublesome, but
is also considered more nutritious than jelly made of gelatine. It is
very desirable, for country housekeepers in particular, to make this
sort of jelly, as the materials are generally in their reach. It is
well, however, in all cases, to keep on hand Cox's or Nelson's
gelatine, on account of the expedition with which jelly may be made
from these preparations.

As jelly is considered more wholesome when not colored by any foreign
substance, no directions will be given in the subsequent pages for
coloring it. The palest amber jelly, clear and sparkling, flavored
only by the grated rind and juice of a lemon and pale Madeira or
sherry wine, is not only the most beautiful, but the most palatable
jelly that can be made.

Though the recipes accompanying boxes of gelatine do not always
recommend boiling, it is a great improvement to jelly, adding
brilliancy, transparency, and a better flavor. Only the grated yellow
rind and strained juice of the lemon should be used, and these, with
the requisite quantity of pale Madeira or sherry, should be added
after the other ingredients have been well boiled together. The white
rind or one single lemon seed will render the jelly bitter. A
delicious preserve (for which a receipt is given under the proper
heading), may be made of lemons, after the yellow rind has been grated
off and the juice pressed out for jelly.

The best and most simple arrangement for straining jelly is to invert
a small table, fold an old table-cloth four double, tie each corner to
a leg of the table; set a bowl under the bag thus formed, with another
bowl at hand to slip in its place when the jelly first run through is
returned to the bag, as will be necessary, the first never being
transparently clear. Catch a little in a glass. If clear as crystal,
it will be unnecessary to return it again to the bag. You may then put
a thick cloth over the bag to keep in the heat, and if in winter,
place before a fire. Shut up the room, and let it drip. The jelly will
run through the bag more rapidly if the bag is first scalded.

Jelly should never be made in hot weather. Ices are much better and
more seasonable.

Always serve jelly with a pitcher of whipped cream, but do not mix it
beforehand with the cream, as it is best to leave it to the taste of
each person.

For blanc-mange and gelatine, it is best to use gelatine and as few
spices as possible, as spices turn gelatine dark. As such explicit
directions are given in the subsequent pages for the making of these
dishes, it is unnecessary to say anything further on the subject at
present.

A nice custard is made in the following manner: Mix the beaten yolks
of six eggs with a teacup of sugar. Have a quart of milk boiling in a
kettle. Dip up a teacup of milk at a time and pour on the eggs, till
the kettle is emptied, stirring rapidly all the time. Wash out the
kettle, pour the mixture back, and stir constantly till it thickens.
Then pour it into a bowl and stir till cool, to make it smooth and
prevent it from curdling. Put in the bottom of glass mugs slips of
preserved orange, lemon, or citron. Fill nearly full with custard; put
whipped cream and grated nutmeg on top.

Or, the yolks may be mixed with boiled milk and sugar in the same
proportions, but instead of being returned to the kettle, may be
poured into china or earthenware custard-cups, set in a pan of boiling
water, placed in a stove or range, and baked. The boiled milk must be
seasoned by boiling a vanilla bean in it, or a few peach leaves, or it
may be flavored with caromel. Serve the custard with whipped cream on
top.


STOCK JELLY.

To one and a half gallons of stock, put the whipped whites of eight
eggs. Put in six blades of mace and the rind of three lemons, 41/2
pounds sugar. Let it boil ten minutes, then add three pints of Madeira
wine, juice of eight lemons, a little vinegar or sharp cider. Let it
boil only a few minutes. Strain through a dripper. If the stock is not
very nice, it may require the whites of one dozen eggs to clear
it.--_Mrs. T._


CALVES' FOOT JELLY.

One quart nice jelly stock, one pint wine, half a pound white sugar,
whites of four eggs beaten up, three spoonfuls lemon juice. Boil all
well and pass through a jelly-bag, kept hot before the fire. Try some
at first, till it drips clear, and then pour out the whole. Peel the
lemons as thin as possible and strain the jelly on the peelings.
Should you wish to turn out the jelly in moulds, put one ounce
isinglass to three pints of jelly.--_Mrs. I. H._


ISINGLASS JELLY.

Dissolve two ounces isinglass in two quarts of boiling water. When
cold, add juice of three lemons and skin of one, whites of three eggs,
well beaten, one and a half pounds of sugar, one pint cider, four
pieces cinnamon (size of the little finger), eight blades of mace. Let
it boil up well. Be careful not to stir after the ingredients are
thoroughly mixed. Let it stand ten minutes after removing from the
fire, and just before straining pour in a pint of wine.--_Mrs. W. R.
R._


CRYSTAL JELLY.

Pare off the rind of one large lemon. Boil in one pint water with one
ounce isinglass; add one pound sugar and one cup pale wine. As soon as
the isinglass is dissolved, strain through a muslin and let it stand
till cold. Grate the rind of another lemon and let it stand in the
juice of the two lemons for a short time. Strain all in a bowl, and
whisk it till it begins to stiffen. Pour in moulds.--_Mrs. E. P. G._


GELATINE JELLY.

Soak one box of Cox's gelatine, three hours, in a pint of cold water.
Then add one pint of cooking wine, the rind and juice of one lemon,
two pounds white sugar, a little mace. Stir these ingredients till the
sugar dissolves, then add two quarts of boiling water, gently stirring
till mixed. Strain at once, through a flannel bag twice. This recipe
makes the best jelly I ever saw.--_Mrs. M. M. D._


_Gelatine Jelly._

To one package of gelatine add one pint cold water, the rind of one
lemon and juice of three. Let it stand an hour. Then add three pints

it stand to jelly.--_Mrs. Col. S._


_Gelatine Jelly_ (_without straining_).

Add a pint cold water to one box Cox's gelatine. Let it stand fifteen
minutes, then add three pints boiling water, one pint wine, the
strained juice and peelings (cut thin) of three lemons, half a teacup
of best vinegar, one and a half pounds loaf sugar, one wine-glass
French brandy, mace or any other spice you like, and a little essence
of lemon. Let it stand an hour, then take out the lemon peel and mace.
Let it stand in a cool place to congeal.--_Mrs. Dr. J._


JELLY WITHOUT EGGS OR BOILING.

Dissolve one package gelatine, an hour, in a pint of cold water. Then

and the rind of two, one quart of wine, two pounds of sugar. Stir all
well together until dissolved.--_Mrs. E. B._


_Jelly without Boiling._

To one of the shilling packages of Cox's gelatine, add one pint cold
water. After letting it stand an hour, add one and a half pounds of
loaf sugar, the juice of four lemons, one pint light wine, three pints
boiling water, and cinnamon to the taste. In cold weather this is
ready for use in four or five hours. Set the vessel with the jelly on
ice, in summer.--_Miss D. D._

Pour two tablespoonfuls cold water on one ounce gelatine to soften it.
Boil three pints rich cream. Stir the gelatine into it whilst on the
fire, and sweeten to the taste. When it cools, season with three
tablespoonfuls peach water. Four ounces almonds, blanched and pounded
very fine and boiled with the blanc-mange, are a great improvement.
When it begins to thicken, pour into moulds. Serve with plain
cream.--_Mrs. J. H. T._


_Blanc-mange._

Sweeten a pint of cream and flavor it with lemon juice. Then whip it
over ice, till a stiff froth. Add one-quarter of an ounce gelatine,

L._


BAKED CUSTARD.

Boil a quart or three pints of cream, or rich milk, with cinnamon, and
three dozen beaten peach kernels, tied in a piece of muslin, or you
may substitute some other flavoring, if you choose. After boiling, let
it cool.

Then beat the yolks of fourteen eggs and whites of four, sweeten and
strain in a pitcher. After it has settled, pour it in cups and set
them in the oven, putting around them as much boiling water as will
reach nearly to the top of the cups. Let it boil till you see a scum

It should be cooked in a tin pail, set in a kettle of boiling water,
to prevent the milk from scorching. Eat cold.--_Mrs. G. W. P._


TAPIOCA.

Boil the pearl tapioca (not the lump kind) as you do rice. When cool,
sweeten to the taste and season with nutmeg. Pour rich cream over it
and stir it to make it smooth. Put one pint cream to two
tablespoonfuls before boiling.--_Mrs. J. H. T._

Eat with powdered sugar, nutmeg and cream.--_Mrs. S. T._


FLOAT.

To a common-sized glass bowl of cream, sweetened with loaf sugar and
flavored with wine, take the whites of six eggs, three large
tablespoonfuls sugar, and three of fruit jelly. Do not beat the eggs
to a froth, but put in the jelly and sugar and beat all
together.--_Mrs. T._


APPLE FLOAT.

Mash a quart cooked or coddled apples smooth through a sieve; sweeten
with six tablespoonfuls sugar, and flavor with nutmeg. Then add the

away to cool. Eat with cream or custard. They will keep two
days.--_Mrs. Dr. J._


ICED APPLES.

Pare and core one dozen fine, firm apples, leaving them whole. Place
in a stewpan, with enough water to cover them, and stew till you can
pierce them with a straw. Then remove from the fire, and set in a dish
to cool. Then fill the centre with currant or some other jelly, and
ice over as you would cake. Serve in a glass dish, and eat with rich
cream or custard.--_Mrs. A. D._




ICE CREAM AND FROZEN CUSTARD.


After having tried many new and patent freezers, some of the best
housekeepers have come to the conclusion that the old-fashioned
freezer is the best. It is well, however, to keep a patent freezer on
hand, in case of your wanting ice cream on short notice; but for
common use an old-fashioned one is the best, especially as servants
are so apt to get a patent freezer out of order.

The great secret of freezing cream quickly in a common freezer is to
have the cream and salt in readiness before breaking the ice into
small pieces the size of a walnut. There must be a space of two inches
between the freezer and the tub in which it is set. Put a little ice
and salt under the bottom of the freezer, then pack alternate layers
of ice and salt several inches higher than the cream is in the
freezer. If there is no top to the tub, with an aperture to admit the
freezer, pin a woollen cloth over it and turn the freezer rapidly.
When the cream begins to harden on the sides of the freezer, cut it
down with a knife, scrape from the sides, and beat with a large iron
spoon. Then cover again, and turn rapidly till it is as hard as mush.
When the ice begins to melt, drain off the salt and water, adding more
salt and ice, which must be kept above the level of the cream in the
freezer. When done, tie large newspapers over the tub and freezer. Put
a woollen cloth or blanket over these, and set the cream in a dark,
cool closet till wanted. In this way it may be kept for hours in
summer, and for days in winter, and will grow harder instead of
melting. As cream can be kept thus, it is well to make it early in the
day and set it aside, leaving more leisure for other preparations that
are better made immediately before dinner.

Ice cream making, like other branches of housekeeping, is much
facilitated by having all the ingredients at hand before beginning on
it. As such explicit directions for the process are given in the
subsequent pages, it is unnecessary for me to add anything further on
the subject. Unless you have pure cream to freeze, it is better to
make plain boiled custard rather than to attempt an imitation of ice
cream.

It is a good plan to make jelly and custard at the same time, so that
the yolks of eggs not used in the jelly may be utilized in custard
either boiled or baked. The same proportions are generally used for
boiled and baked custard. Instead of flavoring with extract of
vanilla, it is much better to boil a vanilla bean in the milk, or to
boil some peach leaves tied up in a piece of muslin (six or eight
leaves to a quart of milk), or to flavor it with burnt sugar. Never
flavor custard with extract of lemon, when you can obtain fresh lemons
for the purpose.

When you have no yolks left from making jelly, boil a quart of milk
(flavored by the above directions). Have ready three eggs, whites and
yolks beaten together to a stiff froth, and into these stir a teacup
of powdered white sugar. Dip up the boiling milk, pour slowly on the
eggs, stirring rapidly. When all the milk has been stirred in the
eggs, wash out the kettle, put the milk and eggs back into it, and let
the mixture boil till it begins to thicken, when it must be taken
immediately from the fire, poured into a bowl, and stirred till cold
and smooth.

Many persons, before freezing, stir in the frothed whites of three
eggs. The same directions given for freezing cream apply to the
freezing of custard.

Boiled custard should never be used as a substitute for cream in
making fruit ice creams, nor should it ever be eaten with jelly.


ICE CREAM.

Dissolve five teaspoonfuls Oswego starch or arrow-root in a teacup
milk. Add to it the whites of three eggs well frothed, and the yolk of
one, well beaten.

Sweeten with loaf sugar and boil half a gallon new milk. As soon as it
begins to boil, pour it in small quantities over the mixture of eggs
and starch, till about half the milk is taken out of the kettle. Then
pour all back in the kettle and stir a few moments. After it cools,
add one quart rich cream; season to the taste and freeze.--_Mrs. Dr.
E._


_Ice Cream._

One quart milk, two eggs, one teaspoonful corn starch, one teaspoonful
arrow-root. A small lump of butter.--_Mrs. E. B._


_Ice Cream._

Cream one tablespoonful butter from which the salt has been washed.
Add three tablespoonfuls com starch. Dissolve this in half a gallon
new milk, heated, sweetened and seasoned. Beat the whites of four
eggs, and stir in just before freezing.--_Mrs. McG._


LEMON ICE CREAM.

One gallon rich cream, six lemons, first rubbed till soft, and then
grated. Tie the yellow peel, which has been grated off, in a piece of
coarse muslin. Cut each lemon in half and squeeze the juice from it.
Strain the juice, and soak the muslin bag of lemon peel in it,
squeezing it frequently till it becomes highly flavored and colored by
it. Then add two teacups of sugar.

In sweetening the cream, allow a teacup of sugar to each quart. Pour
the juice into it slowly, carefully stirring. Froth and freeze,
reserving a portion of cream to pour in as it sinks in freezing.
--_Mrs. S. T._


ORANGE ICE CREAM.

Four oranges, one gallon cream. Rub four or five lumps of sugar on the
orange peel, squeeze the juice out, put the lumps of sugar in it and
pour into the cream. Sweeten heavily with pulverized sugar before
freezing.--_Mrs. M._


STRAWBERRY CREAM.

Four quarts thick sweet cream, four quarts strawberries. The berries
must be mashed or bruised, caps and all, with a teacup of granulated
sugar to each quart. After standing several hours, strain through a
thin coarse cloth.

Put four teacups of white sugar to the cream, and then add the juice
of the berries. Whip or froth the cream with a patent egg-whip or
common egg-beater. Pour two-thirds of the cream into the freezer,
reserving the rest to pour in after it begins to freeze. Raspberry
cream may be made by the same recipe.--_Mrs. S. T._


PEACH CREAM.

Take nice, soft peaches, perfectly ripe. Pare and chop fine, make them
very sweet, and mash to a fine jam. To each quart of peaches, add one
pint of cream and one pint of rich milk. Mix well and freeze. If you
cannot get cream, melt an ounce of Cox's gelatine in a cup of water.
Boil the milk, pour it on the gelatine, and when cold, mix with the
peaches.--_L. D. L._


_Peach Cream._

To two quarts of rich, sweet cream, add two teacups of sugar. Whip to
a stiff froth with a patent egg-whip, one with a wheel, if
convenient; if not, use the common egg-whip. Then peel soft, ripe
peaches till you have about two quarts. As you peel, sprinkle over
them two teacups powdered white sugar. Mash quickly with a silver
tablespoon, or run through a colander, if the fruit is not soft and
ripe. Then stir into the whipped cream, and pour into the freezer,
reserving about one-fourth to add when the cream begins to sink in
freezing. When you add the remainder, first cut down the frozen cream
from the sides of the freezer. Beat hard with a strong iron spoon,
whenever the freezer is opened to cut down the cream, till it becomes
too hard. This beating and cutting down is required only for the
common freezer, the patent freezer needing nothing of the kind.

Tie over the freezer large newspapers, to exclude the air, and set
aside till wanted.

Apricot cream may be made exactly by this receipt.--_Mrs. S. T._


PINEAPPLE ICE CREAM.

Whip two quarts rich, sweet cream to a froth, with two teacups
powdered white sugar. Use a patent egg-whip with a wheel, if
convenient; if not, use the common egg-whip.

Grate two ripe pineapples, and add to them two teacups white sugar.
When well mixed, stir into the cream.

Pour into the freezer, reserving one-fourth. When it begins to freeze,
it will sink; then beat in the remainder with a strong iron spoon.
Beat every time the freezer is opened to cut down the cream from the
sides. Never cook fruit of any sort to make cream.--_Mrs. S. T._


VANILLA ICE CREAM.

Boil half a vanilla bean, cut in small pieces, in half a pint of rich
new milk. When cool, strain and add to two quarts thick sweet cream.
Sweeten with two heaping teacups powdered sugar, and whip to a stiff
froth. Pour into a freezer, reserving one-fourth of the cream. As soon
as it begins to freeze, stir from the sides with a large iron spoon,
and beat hard. Add the remaining cream when it begins to sink. Beat
every time the freezer is opened. When frozen, tie newspapers over the
freezer and bucket, throw a blanket over them, and set in a close,
dark place till the ice cream is wanted.--_Mrs. S. T._


NORVELL HOUSE CARAMEL ICE CREAM.

One gallon rich, sweet cream, four teacups powdered sugar, five
tablespoonfuls caramel. Mix well and freeze hard.


CARAMEL.

Put in a stewpan one teacup nice brown sugar and half a teacup water.
Stew over a hot fire till it burns a little. If too thick, make it of
the consistency of thin molasses, by adding a little boiling water.
Bottle and cork, ready for use.--_Mrs. J. W. H._


_Caramel Ice Cream._

Three quarts cream, two pints brown sugar, put in a skillet and stir
constantly over a brisk fire until it is dissolved. Be careful not to
let it burn, however. While it is melting, heat one pint milk, and
stir a little at a time with the dissolved sugar. Then strain it, and
when cool, pour it into the cream, well beaten. Then freeze.--_Mrs. W.
C. R._


CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM.

Half a pound sweet chocolate, twelve eggs, one gallon milk, two
tablespoonfuls arrow-root, sugar and vanilla to the taste. Dissolve
the chocolate in one pint and a half boiled milk. Whip the eggs. Mix
the arrow-root in a little cold milk, and add to the eggs. Then pour
on one gallon boiled milk, and put on the fire to thicken. When cool,
season and freeze.--_Mrs. D. R._


_Chocolate Ice Cream._

Three quarts milk, eight eggs, six ounces chocolate dissolved in a
pint of boiling water, three heaping tablespoonfuls arrow-root well
mixed in cold milk, one pound and a half of brown sugar, vanilla to
the taste. Made like custard, and boiled very thick.--_Miss D. D._


_Chocolate Ice Cream._

One quart morning's milk, one-quarter of a pound chocolate, one
teaspoonful vanilla, sugar to the taste. Boil as for table use. When
ready to freeze, whip in one quart rich cream.


COCOANUT ICE CREAM.

One pound grated cocoanut, one pound sugar, one pint cream. Stir the
grated nut gradually into the cream. Boil gently, or merely heat it,
so as to thoroughly get the flavor of the nut. Then pour the cream
into a bowl and stir in the sugar. When cold, stir in three pints
fresh cream, then freeze.


_Cocoanut Ice Cream._

One cocoanut, pared and grated. Mix with a quart of cream, sweeten,
and freeze.--_Mrs. E. I._

two tablespoonfuls arrow-root mixed in a little cold milk. Sweeten to
the taste, and freeze.--_Mrs. D. R._


GELATINE ICE CREAM.

Soak one-half package of Cox's gelatine in a pint of morning's milk.
Boil three pints of milk, and while hot, pour on the gelatine,
stirring till dissolved. When cold, add two quarts of cream, and
sweeten and season to your taste. Then freeze. It is improved by
whipping the cream before freezing.--_Miss E. T._


WHITE ICE CREAM.

Three quarts milk, whites of four eggs beaten light, three
tablespoonfuls arrow-root mixed in a little cold water and added to
the eggs. Boil the milk and pour over the eggs, etc. Then put on the

One half-gallon of freshly turned clabber, one-half gallon rich sweet
cream, one good vanilla bean boiled in one-half pint sweet milk, sugar
to the taste. Churn this five minutes before freezing. One can of
condensed milk may be used with less clabber. MRS. H. L. S.


BUTTERMILK CREAM.

One gallon buttermilk, yolks of eight eggs, and whites of four, well
beaten; three pints sweet milk. Boil the sweet milk and pour on the
eggs; then thicken, stirring all the time. When cool stir in the
buttermilk slowly, season and sweeten to the taste, then
freeze.--_Mrs. D. R._


CARAMEL CUSTARD (_Frozen_).

Make a rich custard, allowing a cup of nice brown sugar to every
quart. Stew the sugar till it burns a little. Then mix it with the
custard while both are hot. Boil two sticks cinnamon in the
custard.--_Mrs. J. J. B._


FROZEN CUSTARD.

One quart fresh milk, eight eggs, yolks and whites beaten separately.
Put the milk on the fire, sweetened to the taste, and let it come to
boiling heat; then take it off and add the yolks. Then wash the kettle
and put the custard on the fire again, and let it boil till quite
thick. Take it off, and when cool enough, add the whites. Flavor with
lemon or vanilla, and freeze.--_Mrs. C. N._


_Frozen Custard._

Twelve eggs, one gallon milk, four lemons, sugar to taste,
freeze.--_Mrs. Dr. S._


BISQUE.

Make one-half gallon rich boiled custard, allowing six eggs to each
quart. Add, before taking it from the fire, two pounds of macaroon
almonds. When cold, freeze.--_Mrs. A. P._


PLUMBIERE.

Make a rich custard, and flavor it when cool with wine and extract of
lemon. When half frozen, add blanched almonds, chopped citron, brandy
peaches cut up, and any other brandied or crystallized fruit. Make the
freezer half full of custard and fill with fruit.


FROZEN PUDDING.

Forty blanched almonds pounded rather fine, one ounce citron cut in
small squares, two ounces currants, two ounces raisins stoned and
divided. Soak all in two wine-glasses wine, all night. Make custard of
a pint of cream or milk. If cream, use yolks of four eggs; if milk,
yolks of eight eggs. Make a syrup of one pound white sugar and a pint
of water. When nearly boiling, put in the fruit and wine and boil one
minute. When cool, mix with the custard. Whip whites of the eggs to a
stiff froth, and add to the custard and syrup after they are mixed.
Add last a wine-glass of brandy.--_Miss E. W._


PLUM PUDDING GLACE.

To one pint cream or new milk, stir in thoroughly two tablespoonfuls
arrow-root. Boil three pints milk, and while boiling add the cold

the sugar with the water and lemons. Mix all together just before
freezing.--_Mrs. A. P._


LEMON SHERBET.

Take one dozen lemons, squeeze out the juice, then slice the rind and
pour over it six quarts boiling water. Mix three pounds sugar with the
lemon juice, and one quart milk, brought to a boil and thickened with
three tablespoonfuls arrow-root or corn-starch. Be careful to remove
all the seed and most of the rind, leaving only a few slices to make
the dish pretty. After the lemonade begins to freeze, stir in the
thickened milk, and the whites of six eggs beaten very light.


_Lemon Sherbet._

One dozen good lemons, whites of twelve eggs beaten stiff, three
pounds white sugar, one gallon water. Stir all well together and add
one quart nice fresh cream. Stir often while freezing.--_Miss E. T._


_Lemon Sherbet._

Two quarts water, four large lemons, one pound and a half sugar,
whites of six eggs. Rub some lumps of sugar on the rind of the lemons.
Powder some of the sugar, beat it with the whites of the eggs, and mix
with the lemonade when it begins to freeze.--_Mrs. M._


_A new Recipe for Lemon Sherbet._

Make one and a half gallon rather acid lemonade, grating the peel of
three or four of the lemons before straining the juice into the water.
Let it stand fifteen minutes. Then make and add to it the following
mixture: pour a pint cold water over one box gelatine and let it stand
half an hour; then pour over it one pint boiling water, and let it
stand till thoroughly dissolved. Beat the whites of eight eggs with
two pounds pulverized sugar till as thick as icing; then churn a quart
rich cream till it is reduced to a pint; then beat the froth of the
cream into the egg and sugar. Pour in gradually the lemonade, beating
all the time so as to mix thoroughly, and then freeze. Delicious.
--_Mrs. F. C. W._

Dissolve one box gelatine in one gallon water. Beat two pounds
pineapple through a colander with a wooden pestle. Add the juice of
two lemons and the juice of two oranges; sweeten to your taste, but
add more sugar than is required for ice cream.

Beat six eggs separately and stir in the mixture. When half frozen,
beat rapidly half a dozen times, at intervals.

This makes two gallons when frozen.--_Mrs. E. T._


CITRON ICE.

Slice citron, pour on it a rich, hot lemonade, and freeze.--_Mrs. E.
I._


RASPBERRY ICE.

Three quarts juice, one quart water. Sweeten heavily, and after
putting in the freezer add the whites of six eggs beaten very light.
The same recipe will answer for currant or cherry ice.--_Mrs. M. C.
C._


WATERMELON ICE (_beautiful and delicious_).

Select a ripe and very red melon. Scrape some of the pulp and use all
the water. A few of the seeds interspersed will add greatly to the
appearance. Sweeten to the taste and freeze as you would any other
ice. If you wish it very light, add the whites of three eggs,
thoroughly whipped, to one gallon of the icing just as it begins to
congeal. Beat frequently and very hard with a large iron spoon.--_Mrs.
J. J._


GELATINE ICE.

Let one ounce sparkling gelatine stand an hour in a pint of cold
water. Then add three pints boiling water, one and one-half pounds
loaf sugar, one and one-half pint wine, juice of three lemons, rind
of two lemons. Stir all these ingredients and freeze before allowing
it to congeal. Delicious.


AMBROSIA.

Pare and slice as many oranges as you choose, in a glass bowl.
Sprinkle sugar and grated cocoanut over each layer.--_Mrs. W C. R._


_Ambrosia._

Cut pineapple and orange in slices, sprinkle with sugar, and put in a
deep dish alternately to form a pyramid. Put grated cocoanut between
each layer. If you like, pour good Madeira or sherry wine over the
dish.--_Mrs. T._


PINEAPPLE.

Peel and slice thin, just before eating. Sprinkle pulverized sugar
over it, but nothing else, as the flavor of this delicious fruit is
impaired by adding other ingredients. Keep on ice till wanted.--_Mrs.
S. T._


WATERMELONS.

Keep on ice till wanted. If lacking in sweetness, sprinkle powdered
sugar over them.--_Mrs. S. T._


CANTALEUPES.

Cut out carefully the end with the stem, making a hole large enough to
admit an apple. With a spoon, remove the seed. Fill with ice, replace
the round piece taken out, and place on end. Eat with powdered sugar,
salt, and pepper.--_Mrs. S. T._


PEACHES AND CREAM.

While the first course is being served, peaches should be pared and
split, and the stones removed. Lay in a glass bowl and sprinkle
liberally with powdered sugar. No fruit should be sweetened till just
before eating. Ornament the edges of the bowl with any handsome,
glossy leaves convenient, and serve with cream.--_Mrs. S. T._


STRAWBERRIES

Should never be washed unless sand or earth adheres to them. Cap
carefully while the first course is being served, or, if more
convenient, you may cap in the morning, but never sweeten till just
before eating, as sweetening long beforehand extracts the juice and
makes the fruit tough. Set it on ice, or in a refrigerator. No ice
must be put on fruit. Serve with cream that has been set on ice.
Decorate the edges of the bowl with strawberry leaves.

The same directions will apply to raspberries, blackberries, and
dewberries. Whortleberries may be washed, picked, and drained, though
not sweetened till dinner.--_Mrs. S. T._




PRESERVES AND FRUIT JELLIES.


Always make preserves in a porcelain or brass kettle. If the latter,
have it scoured first with sand, then with salt and vinegar. Then
scald it and put in the sugar and water for the syrup.

In peeling fruit, throw it into cold water to keep it from turning
dark, and let it remain there till you are ready to throw it in the
boiling syrup. Bear in mind that exposure to the air turns peeled
fruit dark.

Boil rather quickly. In preserving fruit whole, boil it a short time
in the syrup, take it out, let it get cold, and then put it again in
the kettle.

Cut sugar is best for preserves which you wish to be clear and
light-colored, but nice brown sugar is best for dark-colored jams and
marmalades, such as those made of blackberries, raspberries,
whortleberries, etc.

The best peaches for preserving, brandying, or pickling, are white
freestone peaches, not quite ripe enough to eat with cream. Pears and
quinces also should be preserved before they are quite ripe enough for
eating. They should be parboiled before eating. No fruit should be
over-ripe when preserved. Damsons and blue plums should be slit
lengthwise with a pen knife, and set in the sun before preserving,
which will render it easy to extract the stones. Cherries also should
be stoned before preserving. A piece of paper dipped in brandy and
laid on top the preserves will help to keep them. I would suggest to
housekeepers that they always put their preserves in glass jars with
screw tops. By this means they can readily inspect it and see if it is
keeping well, without the trouble of untying the jar and looking
inside, as would be necessary in the case of stone jars.

Set the jar of preserves, if they become dry or candied, in a pot of
cold water, which allow to come gradually to a boil. If the preserves
ferment, boil them over with more sugar.

The great secret of making nice fruit jelly is to boil the syrup well
before adding the sugar (which should always be loaf or cut), and you
should allow a pound of sugar to a pint of the juice in acid fruit
jellies, though less will answer for sweet fruit. By boiling the syrup
well before adding the sugar, the flavor and color of the fruit are
retained. Keep the jelly in small, common glasses.


SWEETMEAT PRESERVES.

Cut the rind in any shapes fancied (such as flowers, fruits, leaves,
grapes, fish, etc.), put it in brine strong enough to float an egg,
cover closely with grape leaves, and set away the jar. When ready to
make the preserves, soak the rind in fresh water, changing it till all
taste of salt is removed from the rind. Dissolve four tablespoonfuls
pulverized alum in one gallon water. Lay the rind in this, covered
closely with grape or cabbage leaves. Simmer till it becomes a pretty
green, then soak out the alum by throwing the rind in soft water.

Pour boiling water on half a pound white ginger, and let it stand
long enough to soften sufficiently to slice easily in thin pieces
(retaining the shapes of the races as much as possible). Then boil it
an hour in half a gallon water, and add one ounce mace and two pounds
best cut sugar. This makes a thin syrup, in which boil the rind gently
for half an hour, adding water to keep the rind covered with syrup.

Set the kettle away for four days and then boil again as before,
adding two pounds sugar and more water, if necessary. Repeat the
boiling six or seven times, till the syrup is rich and thick and
sufficient to cover the rind.

The quantity of seasoning given above is for three gallons rind. Allow
two pounds sugar to each pound fruit. This sweetmeat keeps
indefinitely and never ferments.--_Mrs. F. M. C._


WATERMELON OR MUSKMELON MARMALADE.

Weigh twelve pounds rind, previously soaked in brine, and the salt
extracted by fresh water, parboil, put on with twelve pounds sugar
made into a thin syrup, and boil to pieces. Add the peelings of twelve
oranges and twelve lemons, previously soaked in water, cut in strips
and boiled extremely soft, the water being changed three times while
boiling. Stir constantly from the bottom with a batter-cake turner.
Cook very thick. Put in wide-mouthed glass jars.--_Mrs. S. T._


RIPE MUSKMELON OR WATERMELON PRESERVES.

During the summer, peel and slice indifferent cantaleupes (such as you
do not care to eat), especially such as are not quite ripe. Throw them
into brine, together with your thickest watermelon rinds, peeling off
the outside skin. When you have enough, weigh them, throw them in
fresh water, which change daily till the salt is extracted. Boil in a
preserving kettle till soft enough to pierce with a straw. Make a
syrup, allowing one pound sugar for each pound fruit. When it boils,
put the rind in it and simmer steadily till the rind is transparent
and the syrup thick. When cool, add the juice and grated rind of
twelve lemons. Let it stand in a bowl several days. Then strain the
syrup (which will have become thin), boil it again, pour over the
rind, and put the preserves in glass jars with screw tops.--_Mrs. S.
T._


RIPE MUSKMELON PRESERVES.

Peel and slice the melons, soak them twenty-four hours in salt water,
twenty-four hours in alum water, and twenty-four hours in fresh water,
changing the latter several times. Then make a strong ginger tea, in
which boil them slowly till they taste of ginger.

Make a syrup, allowing a pound and a half sugar to each pound fruit,
and adding mace and sliced ginger (the latter must be soaked in
boiling water twelve hours before it is wanted). Cook the melon in the
syrup till clear and tender. You may use sliced lemons as a seasoning
instead of ginger.--_Mrs. R. L._


PINEAPPLE PRESERVES.

Parboil the pineapples, then peel and cut in thick slices, carefully
taking out the cores, which, if allowed to remain, will cause the
preserves to ferment. Put a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit, and
let it remain all night to make the syrup. Boil then till done,
without adding a drop of water to the syrup. --_Mrs. F. C._


ORANGE PRESERVES.

Peel a thin rind off the oranges and make a hole in each end, getting
out all the seed. Pour boiling water over them and let them stand till
next morning. If the water tastes bitter, search for seed. Pour
boiling water over them every day, as long as the bitterness remains.
Boil till soft enough to run a straw through them. Add a pound and a
half sugar to each pound fruit. Make a thin syrup of half the sugar,
and boil the oranges in it a short time. Let them stand in the syrup
three days, then pour the syrup from the fruit, put the rest of the
sugar to it, and boil it down thick. Then pour it over the fruit. A
few lemons added is a great improvement.--_Mrs. J. H._


ORANGE MARMALADE.

Peel the oranges, taking all the seed and tough skin out of them. Cut
the peel in small pieces, put in cold water and boil till tender. Make
a syrup, one pound sugar to one pint water. Put a pound of the oranges
(mixed with the peel) to a pint of the syrup, and boil all for two
hours.--_Mrs. C. C. McP._


ORANGE MARMALADE.

The day before making, peel one dozen oranges (no matter how sour and
indifferent). Throw the peel in a bucket of water, take out the seed,
cut up the pulp fine with a pair of old scissors. Then take the peel,
cut it in thin strips and throw it into fresh water. Pare and slice
pippins (or any other nice apple). Weigh six pounds of them, stew with
a little water till perfectly done, and set away. Next day, run this
pulp through a colander into a preserving kettle. Add six pounds sugar
and boil slowly, constantly scraping from the bottom.

Take the orange peel (which should have been left in soak all night),
boil till perfectly soft and free from bitterness, changing the water
three times while boiling. In another preserving kettle, simmer this
with the orange pulp and two pounds sugar. When both are nearly done,
turn the oranges into the apples and cook them very thick. Cool in a
bowl, and then put in a glass jar with a screw top.--_Mrs. S. T._


SLICED LEMON PRESERVES.

Take large, firm lemons, not quite ripe, cut in slices one-quarter
inch thick, and take out the seed. Soak in brine a week. Then soak
several days in clear water, changing the water twice a day. When all
the salt and the bitter taste are extracted, weigh the lemons and boil
till tender enough to pierce with a straw. Make a thin syrup, allowing
one pound of sugar to each pound of fruit. Put the lemons in and let
them simmer slowly a good many hours. Pour into a large bowl and let
it remain there several days. At the end of that time strain the syrup
(which will have become thin), put the lemons in it again, and boil
till they jelly. When cool put in a glass jar with a screw top. The
same recipe may be used for oranges.--_Mrs. S. T._


LEMON MARMALADE.

Every housekeeper should keep a large jar, or other nice vessel,
filled with brine, in which she may throw lemon peels after being
deprived of the grated rind and juice, used for creams, jellies, etc.
These may remain any length of time, to suit one's convenience. Before
preserving, soak in pure water till all the taste of salt is
extracted. Boil till soft enough to pierce with a straw. Then put in a
preserving kettle nine pounds cut sugar and one quart water. As soon
as it boils, add six pounds lemon peel and three pounds nice sliced
apples (pippins are best). Boil till very thick.--_Mrs. S. T._


LEMON PRESERVES

May be made of lemon peel, prepared exactly by the above recipe. Put
the peel in a preserving kettle and keep covered, while boiling in
clear water, till you can run a straw through it. Then throw it into a
rich syrup (one pound sugar to one of lemon peel), and boil a long
time. Put in a bowl till the next day; then take the syrup (which will
be somewhat thin) and boil again till very thick. Pour it over the
lemon, and when cold it will be jellied.--_Mrs. S. T._


PEACH PRESERVES.

Pare white freestone peaches, not quite ripe. Split in half, take out
the stones, and throw the peaches in a bucket of water to prevent them
from turning dark. Make a syrup of white sugar, using as many pounds
of sugar as you have pounds of peaches. When it has boiled thick, put
in as many peaches as will cover the bottom of the kettle. Let them
boil till nearly done; then take them out, one by one, in a perforated
spoon. Lay them in dishes and set in the sun. When all the peaches
have been carried through this process, put back the first dish of
peaches in the kettle, taking them out when a pretty amber color, and
so on till all have been boiled twice. Meantime the peach-kernels
should have been scalded and skinned. Put them in the boiling syrup,
which must be kept on the fire till very thick. Put the peaches when
cool in glass jars, and pour the syrup over them. In a few days
examine, and if the syrup has become thin, boil again.--_Mrs. S. T._


_Peach Preserves._

Pare, and add to a pound of peaches one and one-quarter pounds best
sugar. Cook very fast for a few moments, in a porcelain kettle. Turn
out in a bowl, cover with muslin or cambric, set in the sun, stirring
every day till they seem quite transparent. They retain their flavor
much better this way than when cooked on the fire. Put in jars, cover
with paper saturated with brandy, and tie up tightly to exclude the
air.--_Mrs. P. W._


PEACH MARMALADE.

Boil twelve pounds soft peaches in a little water. When reduced to a
pulp, run through a colander and boil again till very thick,
constantly scraping from the bottom. Add half a pound sugar to one
pound fruit. Cool in a bowl, and then put in glass jars with screw
tops. Pear marmalade may be made by the same recipe, and also apple
marmalade, except that you flavor the last with lemon juice and
rind.--_Mrs. S. T._


BRANDY PEACHES.

For twelve pounds large freestone Heath peaches, not quite ripe and
delicately pared, make a syrup of four pounds sugar. Scald a few
peaches at a time in the syrup, till all have gone through this
process. Place on dishes to cool. Then put in glass jars and add
enough good whiskey or brandy to the syrup to cover the peaches. Any
spirit will do, if strong enough. Add a few blanched peach-kernels. In
a few days see if more liquor or sugar is required. If so, drain off
the syrup, add what is needed, and pour again over the fruit. It is a
mistake to put too much sugar. Always use freestone peaches.--_Mrs. S.
T._


_Brandy Peaches._

Put the peaches (a few at a time) in boiling lye. Let them remain five
minutes, to loosen the fur. Then take them out and wipe perfectly
clean and white. Then drop them in cold water. Boil them gently in a
rich syrup till a straw will pierce them. Then put in a jar, and mix
equal parts of French brandy with the syrup. Carefully exclude the
air.--_Mrs. G. N._


PEAR PRESERVES.

Scald the fruit, but do not let it remain till it comes to pieces.
Boil till clear, in a syrup made of as many pounds of sugar as you
have of fruit.--_Mrs. J. J. A._


PRESERVED APPLES FOR WINTER USE.

Pare and slice pippins. Put to each pound apples half a pound sugar,
and to every eight pounds thus sweetened one quart water, a few
cloves, the thin rind and juice of a lemon. Stew till clear, and eat
with cream.--_Mrs. B. J. B._


APPLE MANGE.

Stew and mash well three pounds pippins, then add three pounds sugar.
Just before they are done, add a few drops lemon juice. Put in moulds
and it will keep two years. Turned out and sliced, it is a nice dish
for tea. Quinces are as nice as apples, prepared this way.--_Mrs. B.
J. B._


CRAB APPLE PRESERVES.

Put the crab apples in a kettle, with some alum, keeping them
scalding hot for an hour. Take them out, skin and extract the seed
with a small knife, leaving on the stems. Put them in cold water
awhile, then take them out, wipe them and put them in a syrup made of
as many pounds sugar as you have of fruit. Let them stew gently till
they look clear, then take them out and let the syrup boil longer.
Siberian crabs may be preserved in the same way, except that they are
not peeled and cored.


QUINCE JAM.

Pour boiling water over them and let them remain till the skin rubs
off easily. Then peel them and cut off the fair slices. To each pound
put twelve ounces sugar, and let them stew together till the syrup is
sufficiently thick.

Quince preserves may be made by the same recipe as that used for
pears.


DAMSON PRESERVES.

With a sharp penknife, cut a long slit lengthwise in each damson.
Spread in dishes and set in the sun till the seed comes out readily.
Then boil till thoroughly done in a thick syrup made of as many pounds
sugar as there are pounds of damsons.

Preserve green gage plums and other plums by the same recipe.--_Miss
P._


FOX GRAPE PRESERVES.

Seed the grapes, then pour scalding water on them and let them stand
till cold; then draw off the water, put one pound sugar to one pound
of grapes, and boil gently about twenty minutes.--_Mrs. A. D._


CHERRY PRESERVES.

Wash, pick and stone the cherries, saving the juice. Allow one pound
sugar to each pound fruit. Boil the juice and sugar to a thick syrup,
then put in half the cherries and stew till nearly done. Take them out
with a perforated spoon and lay on dishes. Pat in the other half, let
them stew as long as the first; then take out and lay in dishes.
Meantime boil the syrup gently. When the cherries are cool, put them
again in the syrup and boil a short time. Pour in a large bowl and
cool, then put in glass jars and cover tightly.

Scarlet short stems and large wax cherries are best for
preserving.--_Mrs. S. T._


STRAWBERRY PRESERVES.

Cap the berries. Put one and a half pounds sugar to each pound fruit.
Let them stand two or three hours, and then boil thirty minutes.


STRAWBERRY JAM.

Cap and wash the berries, and put them on to stew with a very small
quantity of water. Stir constantly. When thoroughly done and mashed to
a soft pulp, add one pound sugar to each pound fruit. The advantage of
adding sugar last is that it preserves the color and flavor of the
fruit. Stew till sufficiently thick, scraping constantly from the
bottom with a batter-cake turner.--_Mrs. S. T._


RASPBERRY JAM.

Wash and pick the berries, boil with a little water, mashing and
scraping from the bottom as they simmer. When reduced to a thick pulp,
add one-half pound sugar to each pound berries. Stew till very thick,
scraping constantly from the bottom. Cool in a large bowl, then put in
a glass jar with screw top. Blackberry, Dewberry, and Whortleberry Jam
may be made by the same recipe.


FIG PRESERVES.

Pick the figs fully ripe the evening before. Cut off about half the
stem, and let them soak all night in very weak salt and water. Drain
off the salt water in the morning and cover them with fresh. Make a
thick syrup, allowing three-quarters pound loaf sugar to each pound
fruit. When it boils, drop the figs carefully in and let them cook
till they look clear. When done take from the fire and season with
extract of lemon or ginger.

The figs must not be peeled, as the salt water removes the roughness
from the skin and keeps the fruit firm and hard.--_Miss A. S._


TOMATO PRESERVES (_either ripe or green_).

The day before preserving, peel and weigh eight pounds pale yellow,
pear-shaped or round tomatoes, not quite ripe; spread on dishes
alternate layers of tomato and sugar, mixing with the latter the
grated rind and juice of four lemons. In the morning, drain off the
juice and sugar and boil to a thick syrup. Drop in half the tomatoes
and boil till transparent. Take up with a perforated spoon and put on
dishes to cool. Then carry the other half through exactly the same
process. Then strain the juice, wash the kettle, and put in the juice
again. When it boils hard, put in again the first boiled tomatoes.
Take them out when they become amber color, and put in the rest. When
they are all boiled to an amber color, and cooled on dishes, put them
in half-gallon glass jars, and add the syrup after it has been boiled
to a thick jelly.--_Mrs. S. T._


GREEN TOMATO SWEETMEATS.

Slice the tomatoes and soak them a day and night in salt and water,
then in fresh water for an hour or two, then scald in alum water with
grape leaves. When taken out of alum water, put in cold water to cook.
Scald in ginger-tea and again put in cold water, while you make the
syrup. To each pound tomatoes put one and a quarter pounds sugar and a
few races of white ginger. Cook the tomatoes till clear, the syrup
till thick. When cool, season the syrup with essence of lemon and pour
over the tomatoes.--_Mrs. C. M._


RECIPE FOR PUTTING UP FRUIT.

For fruit not very acid, weigh one-quarter of a pound white sugar to
one pound fruit perfectly ripe. After sprinkling the fruit with sugar,
put it in a preserving kettle and let it just come to a boil. Then put
it quickly in glass self-sealing cans, being careful to screw down
the tops tightly.--_Mrs. Dr. E. T. R._


CANDIED FRUIT.

Preserve the fruit, then dip it in sugar boiled to a candied
thickness, and dry it. Grapes and some other fruits may be dipped in
uncooked.


LEMON CONSERVES.

Wash and dry ten lemons. Pare the yellow rind off clear of the white,
and beat it in a mortar with double its weight of sugar. Pack closely
in a jar and cover with part of the sugar.--_Mrs. T._


ORANGE CONSERVES.

Cut the peel in long, thin strips, and stew in water till all
bitterness is extracted. Drain off this water and stew again in a
thick syrup, allowing one pound sugar to each pound peel. Put away in
a cool place for flavoring puddings, pies, etc.


PEACH CONSERVES.

Pare the peaches and cut from the stone in thick slices. Make a syrup,
allowing three-quarters pound sugar to each pound fruit. Boil the
peaches and put them on dishes to dry. As they dry, roll them in
granulated sugar, and pack in jars or boxes.--_Mrs. W. P._


GOLDEN SYRUP.

Five pounds white sugar; one quart water. Let it boil two or three
minutes, then add two pounds strained honey. It will keep for
months.--_Mrs. D. C._


BLACKBERRY JELLY.

Crush one quart blackberries with one pound best loaf sugar. Cook it
over a gentle fire till thick, then add one gill best brandy. Stir it
while over the fire, then put it in pots.--_Mrs. E._


CURRANT JELLY WITHOUT COOKING.

Press the juice from the currants and strain it. To one pint juice
put one pound white sugar. Mix together till the sugar is dissolved.
Then put them in jars, seal them and expose them to a hot sun two or
three days.--_Mrs. E._


CURRANT JELLY.

Pick ripe currants from the stem, and put them in a stone jar. Then
set the jar in an iron pot and let the fruit boil till the juice is
extracted. Pour in a flannel bag and let it drip through--without
squeezing, however, as this makes it cloudy.

To each pint of juice add one pound good white sugar. Boil about
twenty minutes and keep it well skimmed. Put in the glasses while hot,
and sun daily.--_Mrs. P. W._


CRANBERRY JELLY.

Wash and pick the cranberries, put them in the preserving kettle with
a very small quantity of water, cover closely and stew till done. Pour
through a jelly bag or coarse towel, without squeezing, as this will
prevent it from being clear. Measure and pour the liquid into the
preserving kettle. Let it boil up and remove the scum, then add the
sugar, cut or loaf, one pound to a pint. Boil about twenty minutes, or
until it jellies. It preserves the color of fruit jellies to add the
sugar as late as possible.--_Mrs. S. T._


APPLE JELLY.

Take half a peck of pippin apples, wash them clean, slice them from
the core, put them in a preserving kettle with a quart of water. Boil
till entirely soft, then strain through a flannel bag. To each pint of
juice add one pound white sugar and the juice of three lemons. Boil
till jellied. Do not stir while boiling.--_Mrs. P. W._


_Apple Jelly._

Pare and stew sour, juicy apples (Greenings are best), in enough water
to cover them. Strain as for currant jelly. Allow a pound of sugar
for each pound of juice. Put them together and strain. Boil four or
five minutes, skimming thoroughly.--_Mrs. M. B. B._


_Apple Jelly._

Take any number of juicy apples, put them in a porcelain kettle, and
boil to rags. Then strain them through a cloth or sieve. Put a pound
of loaf sugar to each pint of the juice, and boil till it jellies.
Flavor with the seed beaten in a mortar, and put in while the apples
are cooking.--_Mrs. G. W._


CRAB APPLE JELLY.

Slice the apples, take out the cores and seed, as they make the jelly
bitter. Put them in a kettle cover with water, and boil till quite
soft, keeping it well skimmed. Pour the pulp in a jelly bag, and let
it drip through. To each pint of juice, add one pound and a half of
sugar. Pour in the glasses while hot. Delicious with meats.--_Mrs. P.
W._


QUINCE JELLY.

Make the same as apple jelly, only do not pare or core the fruit, as
much of the jelly is contained in those parts. Or, you may take the
sound parings and cores, stew them and strain the liquor twice, and
you will have a jelly as nice as that made from the fruit. To each
pound of juice allow one pound of sugar. Boil fifteen minutes.--_Mrs.
M. B. B._


ORANGE JELLY.

Grate the rinds of two Seville and two China oranges, and two lemons.
Squeeze the juice of six oranges and three lemons. Add one and a
quarter pounds of loaf sugar and one-quarter of a pint of water, and
boil till it jellies. Have ready a quart of isinglass jelly, made
quite stiff. Put it to the syrup and let it boil up once. Then strain
it and put it in a mould.--_Mrs. V. P. M._


JELLY ORANGES.

Dissolve one package gelatine in one cup cold water, afterwards adding
two cups boiling water to thoroughly dissolve it. Add then three cups
white sugar, one-quarter teaspoonful cinnamon, grated rind of three
oranges, juice of twelve fine oranges. Strain through a flannel bag
into a pitcher, without shaking or squeezing. Extract the pulp from
the orange, by making a hole in one end of it large enough to admit a
mustard spoon. Soak the rind a few hours, and then pour the jelly into
each orange through the hole at the end. Then set aside to congeal.
Garnish with orange leaves. Cut each orange in two. A very ornamental
dish.--_Mrs. McG._


GREEN GRAPE JELLY.

Gather Catawba grapes before ripening. Pick them from the stem, wash
them, and put them in a stone jar. Set the jar in a kettle of cold
water over a hot fire. When the juice comes out of the grapes, take
the kettle off and strain the grapes. To each pint of juice put one
pound of the best loaf sugar. Boil twenty minutes in the kettle. Ripe
grape jelly may be made in the same way.--_Mrs. E._


GRAPE JELLY.

The chief art in making jelly is to boil it continuously, slowly and
gently. It will not harden well if the boiling stops, even for a few
moments. To preserve the true color and flavor of fruit in jellies or
jams, boil well before adding the sugar; in this way the water
contained in all fruit juices is evaporated. Heat the sugar before
adding it. In making grape jelly, pick the grapes from their stems,
wash them, put them over the fire in a vessel containing a little
water, to keep them from burning. Stew a few moments; mash gently with
a silver spoon, strain, and to every pint of juice, allow one pound of
white sugar. After the juice comes to the boiling point, boil twenty
minutes, pour it over the heated sugar, and stir constantly till all
is dissolved. Then fill the jelly glasses.--_J. I. M._


REMEDY FOR MOULDINESS IN FRUIT JELLIES.

Fruit jellies may be preserved from mouldiness by covering the surface
one-quarter of an inch deep with finely pulverized loaf sugar. Thus
protected, they will keep for years.--_Mrs. R. C. M. W._


TOMATO JELLY.

Take ripe tomatoes, peel them carefully, cutting out all the seams and
rough places. To every pound put half a pound of sugar. Season with
white ginger and mace. Boil to a stiff jelly, then add enough good
cider vinegar to keep it.--_Mrs. Dr. P. C._


SUGAR CANDY.

Two cupfuls sugar, one cupful water, one wineglassful vinegar, one
tablespoonful butter. Cook ten or fifteen minutes.--_Mrs. Dr. J._


_Sugar Candy._

Three cupfuls sugar, half a cupful vinegar, half a cupful water, juice
of one lemon. Boil without stirring, till brittle. Pour on a buttered
dish and pull till white and light.--_Mrs. McG._


SUGAR KISSES.

Whisk the whites of four eggs to a stiff froth and stir in half a
pound sifted white sugar. Flavor as you like. Lay it when stiff in
heaps the size of a small egg, on white paper. Lay on a board half an
inch thick and put in a hot oven. When a little yellowish, slip off
two of the kisses with a knife and join the bottom parts together.
Continue till all are thus prepared.--_Mrs. R._


NUT CANDY.

Make sugar candy by one of the foregoing receipts, but instead of
pouring it into a dish, drop it at intervals over a buttered dish. On
each bit of candy thus dropped, lay half the kernel of an English
walnut, and when a little cool, pour half a spoonful of sugar candy on
top. Candy of almonds, pecans, or palm nuts may be made by the same
recipe.--_Mrs. S. T._


CREAM CANDY.

Two pounds of sugar, half a cup water, two tablespoonfuls vinegar, one
tablespoonful butter. Boil twenty minutes. Season with lemon or
vanilla, just as you take it off. Put in a dish and stir till
cold.--_Mrs. McN._


MOLASSES CANDY.

Boil one quart molasses in a rather deep vessel. Boil steadily,
stirring from sides and bottom. When a little, poured in a glass of
cold water, becomes brittle, it is done. Pour in a buttered dish and
pull as soon as cool enough to handle, or you may stir in, when it is
nearly done, some picked kernels of the common black walnut. Boil a
little longer, pour on a buttered dish, and cut in squares just before
it gets cold.--_Mrs. S. T._


CARAMELS.

One cake (half a pound) of Baker's chocolate broken up, four pounds
brown sugar, half a pound fresh butter, one pint of milk. Pour the
milk in a preserving kettle and pour the other ingredients into this.
Let it boil at least half an hour, stirring frequently. When done, a
crust of sugar will form on the spoon and on the side of the kettle.
Pour in a large tablespoonful extract of vanilla, take from the fire
and stir rapidly till it begins to thicken like mush. Then pour
quickly into buttered dishes or pans, and when nearly cold cut into
small squares.--_Mrs. S. T._


_Caramels._

Three pounds white sugar, half a pound of chocolate, one pint milk,
six ounces of butter. Boil three-quarters of an hour and stir
constantly.--_Mrs. R. C._


CHOCOLATE CARAMELS.

Two and one-half pounds of sugar, three-quarters pound of chocolate,
one quarter pound of butter, half a pint of milk or cream.--_Mrs. W.
C. R._


CREAM CHOCOLATE.

One cupful of cream, with enough white sugar to thicken it. Boil till
thick, and when cold, roll up in little balls and put them on a dish
on which has been poured some melted chocolate. Then pour over them
with a spoon some melted chocolate. When quite cool, cut apart and
trim off the edges, if uneven. This cream should be seasoned with a
few drops of vanilla and the dish should be buttered.--_Miss N._


COCOANUT CARAMELS.

One-quarter pound Baker's chocolate (half cake), one-quarter pound
butter, two pounds nice brown sugar, one teacup rich milk. Stew half
an hour or till thick. Add a grated cocoanut. Stir till it begins to
boil again. Take from the fire, stir in a tablespoonful vanilla, and
pour into buttered dishes. When cool enough to handle, make into
balls, the size of a walnut and place on buttered dishes.--_Mrs. S.
T._


_Cocoanut Caramels._

Pour a teacup of boiling milk over one-quarter cake of pounded
chocolate. Let it steep an hour, then add one and one-quarter pounds
of white sugar, and the milk of a cocoanut. Boil till perfectly done.
Then remove from the fire, adding the grated cocoanut. Season with
vanilla, pour in buttered dishes, and cut in blocks.--_Mrs. W. C._


COCOANUT BALLS.

Wet two pounds of sugar with the milk of a cocoanut. Boil and stir
till it begins to granulate. Then stir in the cocoanut grated fine.
Boil a short time longer, then pour into buttered dishes, and as soon

COCOANUT DROPS.

The white part of a grated cocoanut, whites of four eggs well beaten,
one-half pound sifted white sugar. Flavor with rose water or lemon.
Mix all as thick as can be stirred; lay in heaps half an inch apart,
on paper or on a baking-pan, in a hot oven. Take them out when they
begin to look yellowish.--_Mrs. R._


ALMOND MACAROONS.

One-half pound almonds, blanched and pounded, with a teaspoonful
essence of lemon, till a smooth paste. Add an equal quantity of sifted
white sugar and the whites of two eggs. Work well together with a
spoon. Dip your hand into water and work them into balls the size of a
nutmeg. Lay them on white paper an inch apart, then dip your hand in
water and smooth them. Put them in a slow oven for three-quarters of
an hour. Cocoanut may be used instead of almonds.--_Mrs. M. G. H._




WINE.


Be sure to get perfectly ripe fruit for making wine, but do not gather
it immediately after rain, as it is watery then and less sweet than
usual.

Be very careful to stop the wine securely as soon as fermentation
ceases, as otherwise it will lose its strength and flavor. Watch
carefully to see when fermentation ceases.

Strawberry wine makes a delicious flavoring for syllabub, cake, jelly,
etc., and so does gooseberry wine. Dewberries make a prettier and
better wine than blackberries, and have all the medicinal virtues of
the latter.

The clearest wine is made without straining, by the following process:
Take a tub or barrel (a flour-barrel for instance), and make a little
pen of sticks of wood at the bottom. On top of this pen lay an armful
of clean straw. Bore a hole in the side of the tub or barrel as near
the bottom as possible, and set it on a stool or box so as to admit of
setting a vessel underneath it. After mashing the berries intended for
wine, put them on top the straw, and let the juice drain through it
and run through the hole at the side of the tub or barrel into the
vessel set beneath to catch it. Be careful to have this vessel large
enough to avoid its being overrun. Any open stone vessel not used
before for pickle will answer, or a bucket or other wooden vessel may
be used. Let the berries remain on the straw and drain from evening
till the next morning. Some persons make a slight variation on the
process above described, by pouring hot water over the berries after
putting them on the straw. After the draining is over, an inferior
sort of wine may be made by squeezing the berries.

The following process will make wine perfectly clear: To a half-gallon
of wine put two wine-glasses of sweet milk. Stir it into the wine and
pour it all in a transparent half-gallon bottle. Stop it and set it by
for twenty-four hours, at the end of which time the wine will be
beautifully clear, the sediment settling with the milk at the bottom.
Pour off the wine carefully into another bottle, not allowing any of
the sediment or milk to get into the fresh bottle. The same directions
apply to vinegar.


BLACKBERRY WINE.

Fill large stone jars with ripe black or dewberries. Cover them with
water, mash them, and let them stand several hours, or, if freshly
gathered, let them stand all night. Then strain through a thick cloth
and add three pounds white sugar to each gallon of juice. Let the wine
stand a few days in the jars, stirring and skimming each day. Put it
in a demijohn, but do not cork it up for some time.--_Mrs. M. D._


_Blackberry Wine._

Measure the berries and bruise them; to every gallon adding one quart
of boiling water. Let it stand twenty-four hours, stirring
occasionally; then strain off the liquor into a cask, adding two
pounds sugar to every gallon. Cork tight and let it stand till the
following October, when it will be ready for use without further
boiling or straining.


_Blackberry Wine._

One bushel very ripe berries makes ten gallons wine. Mash the berries
as fine as possible and pour over them a water-bucket of clear spring
water. Cover it and let it stand twenty-four hours to ferment. Next
day strain through a cloth, and to every three quarts juice add two
quarts clear cold water and five pounds common brown sugar. Pour in a
demijohn or runlet, reserving some to fill the vessel as fermentation
goes on. After six or eight days, put to every ten gallons one-half
box gelatine. After two weeks, cover the bung-hole with a piece of
muslin. Two or three weeks later, cork tightly and then leave
undisturbed for six months. After that time, bottle and seal. Superior
currant wine may be made by this recipe.--_Mrs. F._


_Blackberry Wine._

Fill a large stone jar with the ripe fruit and cover it with water.
Tie a cloth over the jar and let them stand three or four days to
ferment; then mash and press them through a cloth. To every gallon of
juice add three pounds of brown sugar. Return the mixture to the jar
and cover closely. Skim it every morning for more than a week, until
it clears from the second fermentation. When clear, pour it carefully
from the sediment into a demijohn. Cork tightly, set in a cool place,
When two months old it will be fit for use.--_Mrs. Gen. R. E. Lee._

[Copied from a recipe in Mrs. Lee's own handwriting.]


GRAPE WINE.

Take any convenient quantity of perfectly ripe grapes. Mash them so as
to break all the skins, and put them in a tub or other clean vessel,
and let them remain twenty-four hours; with a cider-press or other
convenient apparatus, express all the juice, and to each gallon of
juice thus obtained add from two to two and a half pounds of white
sugar (if the grapes are sweet, two pounds will be enough), put the
juice and sugar in a keg or barrel, and cover the bung-hole with a
piece of muslin, so the gas can escape and dust and insects cannot get
in; let it remain perfectly quiet until cold weather, then bung up
tightly. This wine will need no clarifying; if allowed to rest
perfectly still it can be drawn off perfectly clear.--_Mr. W. A. S._


_Grape Wine._

Pick the grapes from the bunch, mash thoroughly, and let them stand
twenty-four hours. Then strain and add three pounds of sugar to every
gallon of juice. Leave in a cask six months, and then bottle, putting
three raisins in each bottle.--_Mrs. R. L._


_Grape Wine._

Press the grapes, and when the juice settles, add two pounds of white
sugar to four quarts of juice. Let it stand twenty-four hours, drain,
put in a cask; do not stop tightly till the fermentation is
over.--_Mrs. R. A._


CATAWBA GRAPE WINE.

Mash ripe grapes to a pulp, and let them stand twenty-four hours. Then
squeeze through a cloth, and add two pounds of sugar to each gallon of
pure juice. Put in a cask, leave the bung out, and put coarse muslin
over the hole to admit the air. Let it stand six weeks, or till
fermentation ceases. Then close the mouth of the cask and let the wine
stand several months, after which it may be drawn off.--_Mrs. R. D._


_Catawba Grape Wine._

To every gallon of grape juice add one quart of cold, clear water, and
three pounds of "A" sugar. Pour into a runlet and let it remain
uncorked fourteen days, and then cork loosely. Add half a box gelatine
to every ten gallons, fourteen days after making it. At the end of a
month tighten the cork, then let it remain undisturbed for six months,
after which it may be carefully racked, bottled, and sealed.--_Mrs.
Dr. E._


FOX GRAPE WINE.

To every bushel of fox grapes add twenty-two quarts of water. Mash the
fruit and let it stand twenty-four hours. Strain through a linen or
fine sieve that will prevent the seed from getting through. To every
gallon of juice add two pounds of brown sugar. Fill the cask not quite
full. Let it stand open fourteen days, and then close the bung.--_Mrs.
Gen. R. E. Lee._

[The above was copied from an autograph recipe of Mrs. Lee's, kindly
furnished by her daughter.]


WILD BLACK GRAPE WINE.

Pick the grapes from the stem and cover with water. Mash and strain
immediately. Add three pounds white sugar to one gallon juice. Garden
grape wine is made in the same way. If you prefer a red wine, let the
water stand on the grapes all night. The light wine is the best,
however.

This wine has to be kept much longer than blackberry wine before it is
fit for use.--_Mrs. M. D._


NATIVE GRAPE WINE.

Pick all the perfect grapes from the bunches, wash them and pack them
down in a wooden or stone vessel. Pour over them boiling water--about
one quart to every bushel of grapes. Tie a cloth over them and let
them stand a week or ten days. Then strain it and add three pounds
sugar to every gallon juice, mixing it well. Put in demijohns and tie
a cloth over the top. Let it stand six months, and then cork it
tightly. The wine will be fit for use in nine months.--_Mrs. Dr. S._


GOOSEBERRY WINE.

To every gallon of gooseberries add three pints of boiling water. Let
it stand two days, then mash and squeeze out the juice, to every
gallon of which add three pounds of sugar. Put it in a cask and draw
off about the usual time of drawing off other wines.--_Mrs. R. T. H.
A._


CURRANT WINE.

Put three pounds of brown sugar to every squeezed gallon of currants.
Add a gallon of water, or two, if juice is scarce. It is better to put

boiling water. Let it stand twenty-four hours, stirring occasionally.
Then strain off the liquor, put in a jar, adding two pounds sugar to
every gallon. Stop tightly, and let it stand till the next October,
when it will be fit for use without straining or boiling.


STRAWBERRY WINE.

Mash the berries and add to each gallon of fruit a half-gallon boiling
water. Let it stand twenty-four hours, then strain and add three
pounds brown sugar to each gallon juice. Let it stand thirty-six
hours, skimming the impurities that rise to the top. Put in a cask,
reserving some to add as it escapes from the cask. Fill each morning.
Cork and seal tightly after the fermentation is over.--_Mrs. E._


ORANGE WINE.

One gallon juice of sour oranges, four gallons water, twenty pounds
sugar. Boil it and clarify with the whites of two eggs; skim the
liquid till the scum has disappeared. Pour into a vessel of suitable
size, taking the precaution to first strain it through flannel. Add
three-quarters of a bottle of raw juice and let it ferment. Bottle in
six months. Put less sugar if you prefer a wine less sweet.--_Mrs. N._


CIDER WINE.

One gallon sweet cider, three pounds sugar. Put in a cask and let it
ferment. Keep the vessel full so that it will run over. Let it stand
fifteen days. Put the corks in a little tighter every day. Let it
stand three months, then bottle and seal up.--_Mrs. E. B._


TOMATO WINE.

Pick small, ripe tomatoes off the stems, put them in a clean bucket or
tub, mash well, and strain through a linen rag (a bushel will make
five gallons of juice). Add from two and a half to three pounds brown
sugar to each gallon. Put in a cask and let it ferment like raspberry
wine. If two gallons water be added to a bushel of tomatoes, the wine
will be as good.--_Mrs. A. D._

the whites, with grated nutmeg, reserving enough for top-dressing.
--_Mrs. P. W._


_Eggnog._

Take any number of eggs you wish, beat the whites and yolks separately
and as light as possible. Stir into the yolks, while beating, a
tablespoonful of sugar to each egg. Then pour on the yolks and sugar a
small wine-glassful of wine, flavored with a little vanilla, to each
egg. On that pour a wine-glassful of rich milk or cream to each egg.
Beat the whites as if for cake, then beat in enough sugar to make them
smooth and stiff. Stir this into the eggnog for twenty minutes, and
grate nutmeg on the top.--_Mrs. R. C._

best.--_Mrs. A. D._




THE SICK-ROOM--DIET AND REMEDIES FOR THE SICK.


First of all, let me say that after a reliable physician has been
called in, his directions should be strictly followed, and his
instructions should be the law in the sick-room. Have everything in
readiness for his admission immediately after his arrival, as his time
is valuable and it occasions him both annoyance and loss of time to be
kept waiting outside of the sick-room, after reaching the house of the
patient.

Pure air is of vital importance in the sick-room. Many persons exclude
fresh air for fear of dampness, but even damp air is better than
impure. Even in cold weather, there should be a free circulation of
air. If there are no ventilators, let the air circulate from the tops
of the windows, rather than admit it by opening the door, which is apt
to produce a draft. Meantime keep up a good fire; if practicable, let
it be a wood fire, but if this be not attainable, have an open grate,
with a coal fire. The sight of a bright blaze is calculated to cheer
the patient, while the sight of a dark, close stove is depressing. By
no means allow a sick person to be in a room warmed by a flue or
register.

The old idea of darkening the sick-room is exploded. It should be
darkened only when the patient wishes to sleep. If the eyes are weak,
admit the sunshine from a quarter where it will not fall upon them.
The modern science of physics has come to recognize sunshine as one of
the most powerful of remedial agencies, and cases are not rare in
which invalids have been restored to health by using sun-baths, and
otherwise freely enjoying the sunshine.

It is best to have no odors in the sick-room unless it be bay rum,
German cologne, or something else especially fancied by the sick
person. Where there is any unpleasant exhalation, it is far better to
let it escape by properly ventilating the room, than to try to
overcome it by the aid of perfumery. In fevers, where there are
offensive exhalations from the body, sponging with tepid water will
help to remove the odor, and will also prove soothing to the patient.
In winter, expose but a small portion of the body at a time, in
sponging. Then rub gently with the hand or a coarse towel, and there
will be no danger of the patient's taking cold, even in winter.

Be careful to keep warm, soft flannels on the sick person in winter.
In summer, do not keep a pile of bedclothes on the patient, even
though chilly. It is better to keep up the circulation by other means,
such as rubbing or stimulants. Scrupulous neatness should be observed
about the bed-linen (as well as the other appointments of the
sick-room). Never use bed-quilts or comforts; they are not only heavy,
but retain the exhalations from the body. Use soft, fleecy blankets
instead.

The nurse should watch her opportunity of having the bedclothes taken
into the fresh air and shaken, and the bed made up, when the patient
has been lifted up and set in an easy-chair near the fire. The
arrangements about the bed should be quickly made, so that the patient
may be able to lie down again as soon as fatigued. Let such sweeping
and dusting as are necessary be also done with dispatch, using a
dust-pan to receive the dust from the carpet. Avoid clouds of dust
from the carpet, and of ashes from the fireplace.

The nurse has a very important part to play, as physicians say that
nursing is of equal importance as medical attendance. The nurse should
be careful not to wear a dress that rustles, nor shoes that creak, and
if the patient has any fancy, or any aversion connected with colors,
she should regard it in her dress. Indeed, the patient should be
indulged in every fancy that is not hurtful.

The nurse should be prompt in every arrangement. Where blisters or
poultices are to be used, she should not wait till the last moment to
prepare them, but should do so before uncovering the patient to apply
them, or even broaching the subject. If anything painful or
distasteful has to be undergone by the patient, it should not be
discussed beforehand with or before the patient; but when all is in
readiness, with cheerful and soothing words, let it be done.

The patient should never be kept waiting for food, medicine, bath, or
any other requisite. Every arrangement should be made beforehand to
supply his or her needs in good time. Crushed ice and other needful
things should be kept always at hand, so the patient may have them at
any moment without delay. Especially on the approach of night, try to
provide everything needed during the night, such as ice, mustard, hot
water, kindling wood, a large piece of soapstone for the feet, as this
is more cleanly and retains heat better than other things used for the
purpose. Other things, such as the nature of the sickness may call
for, should be thought of and provided before nightfall.

As the sick are very fastidious, all food for them must be prepared in
the most delicate manner. Do not bring the same article of food
several times consecutively, but vary it from time to time. Do not let
a sick person have any article of food forbidden by a physician, as
there are many reasons known to them only, why dishes fancied by the
sick should be injurious.

Avoid whispering, as this excites nervousness and apprehension on the
part of the sick. Do not ask in a mournful tone of voice how the
patient is. Indeed, it is best to ask the sick as few questions as
possible. It is far better to watch their symptoms for yourself than
to question them. Examine for yourself if their feet are warm, and
endeavor to discover their condition and their wants, as far as
possible, without questions.

In a case of illness, many well-meaning persons crowd to see the
patient; do not admit them into the sick-room, as it is both exciting
and fatiguing to an ill person to see company, and, when in a critical
condition, the balance might be disastrously turned by the injudicious
admission of visitors. Both mind and body must be kept quiet to give
the patient a chance for recovery. When well enough to listen to
conversation, the patient should hear none but what is cheerful and
entertaining, never any of an argumentative or otherwise unpleasant
nature.

Do not allow the patient to read, as it is too great a tax on the
sight and brain before convalescence. Suitable books, in large print,
are a great resource to the patient when arrived at this stage, but
should be read only in moderation.

Driving out is a delightful recreation for convalescents, and they
should be indulged in it as soon as the physician pronounces it safe.
In winter, they should be carried driving about noon, so as to enjoy
the sunshine at its warmest. In summer, the cool of the morning or
evening is the best time to drive them out; but if the latter time be
chosen, be careful to return immediately after sundown. Make
arrangements for the patient on returning to find the room thoroughly
cleaned, aired, and adorned with fresh flowers (always so cheering in
a sick-room), and let the bed be nicely made up and turned down. It is
well to have some little refreshment awaiting after the drive--a
little cream or milk toddy, a cup of tea or coffee, or, if the weather
be hot, some cooling draught perhaps would be more acceptable. It is
well to keep the convalescent cheered, by projecting each day some new
and pleasant little plan for the morrow.


ARROWROOT.

Break an egg. Separate the yolk and white. Whip each to a stiff froth.
Add a tablespoonful of arrowroot and a little water to the yolk. Rub
till smooth and free from lumps. Pour slowly into half a pint of
boiling water, stirring all the time. Let it simmer till jelly-like.
Sweeten to the taste and add a tablespoonful of French brandy. Stir in
the frothed white and take hot in winter. In summer, set first on ice,
then stir in the beaten white. Milk may be used instead of
water.--_Mrs. S. T._


_Arrowroot._

Mix one tablespoonful arrowroot with enough cold water to make a
paste, free from lumps. Pour this slowly into half a pint boiling milk
and let it simmer till it becomes thick and jelly-like. Sweeten to the
taste and add a little nutmeg or cinnamon.--_Mrs. R. C. M. W._


SEAMOSS FARINA.

One tablespoonful in one quart hot water makes jelly; one
tablespoonful in one quart milk makes blanc-mange. Stir fifteen
minutes, and, while simmering, flavor with vanilla or lemon. Suitable
for sick persons.--_M. L. G._


RACAHAUT.

One pound rice flour, one pound chocolate, grated fine, two
tablespoonfuls arrowroot. From a half-pound to a pound of sugar. Mix
well together and put in a close jar. To one quart milk, rub in four
dessertspoonfuls of the above mixture. Give it a boil up and season
with vanilla.--_Mrs. J. H. T._


CRACKED WHEAT.

Soak the wheat in cold water all night. Pour off this water in the
morning. Pour boiling water then over the wheat and boil it about half
an hour, adding salt and butter. Eat with cream.--_Mrs. A. M._


BREAKFAST FOR AN INVALID.

Bread twelve hours old, an egg and black tea.--_Mrs. A._


FOOD FOR A SICK INFANT.

Gelatine two inches square, milk half a pint, water half a pint, cream
one-half to one gill, arrowroot a teaspoonful. Sweeten to the
taste.--_Mrs. J. D._


WINE WHEY.

Put half pint milk over the fire, and, as soon as it begins to boil,
pour slowly into it a wine-glass of sherry wine, mixed with a
teaspoonful white sugar. Grate into it a little nutmeg, and as soon as
it comes to a boil again, take it off the fire. When cool, strain for
use.--_Mrs. R. C. M. W._


MILK PUNCH.

Pour two tablespoonfuls good brandy into six tablespoonfuls milk. Add
two teaspoonfuls ground loaf sugar and a little grated nutmeg. An
adult may take a tablespoonful of this every two or three hours, but
children must take less.--_Mrs. R. C. M. W._


BEEF ESSENCE.

Cut one pound beef in small bits, sprinkle with a very little salt,
tie up in a close stone jar, and set in boiling water. Boil it hard an
hour or more, then strain it. Chicken may be prepared the same way.
Nice for the sick.--_Mrs. Col. W._


BEEF-TEA.

Take half a pound fresh beef for every pint of beef-tea required.
Carefully remove all fat, sinew, veins, and bone from the beef. Cut it
in pieces under an inch square and let it soak twelve hours in
one-third of the water required to be made into tea. Then take it out
and let it simmer three hours in the remaining two-thirds of the
water, the quantity lost by evaporation being replaced from time to
time. The boiling liquor is then to be poured on the cold liquor in
which the meat was soaked. The solid meat is to be dried, pounded in a
mortar, and minced so as to cut up all strings in it, and mixed with
the liquid. When the beef-tea is made daily, it is convenient to use
one day's boiled meat for the next day's tea, as thus it has time to
dry and is more easily pounded. Avoid having it sticky and too much
jellied, when cold.


ESSENCE OF CHICKEN.

In a case of extreme sickness, when it is important that what little
nourishment the patient can take should be highly condensed, the
following is an excellent mode for concentrating, in a small compass,
all the nutritive properties of a chicken.

After picking the chicken, sprinkle a little salt over it and cut it
in pieces, as if for frying. Put the pieces in a small glass jar (or
wide-mouthed bottle), stop it tightly, and put it in a pot of cold
water, gradually heating the latter till it boils. Let the jar of
chicken remain in the water till the juices are well extracted, then
pour them off for the patient.--_Mrs. M. C. C._


CHICKEN JELLY.

Take a large chicken, cut the flesh from its bones, break the bones,
soak an hour in weak salt and water to extract the blood. Put on in a
stewpan with three pints of cold water. Simmer till reduced to less
than half its original quantity. Sprinkle a little salt on it, and
strain in a bowl. Keep on ice.--_Mrs. S. T._


A NOURISHING WAY TO PREPARE CHICKEN, SQUIRREL, OR BEEF FOR THE SICK.

Put in a clean, glazed jar or inner saucepan. Set this in another
vessel of boiling water. Cover closely, and keep boiling for hours.
Season the juice thus extracted with a little salt, stir in a
teaspoonful of fresh milk, and give to the patient.--_Mrs. T._


PANADA.

Lay six nice crackers in a bowl. Sprinkle over them powdered sugar and
a pinch of salt, adding a very small piece of fresh butter. Pour
boiling water over the crackers, and let them remain near the fire
half an hour. Then add a teaspoonful of good French brandy, or a
tablespoonful of Madeira wine, and a little grated nutmeg.--_Mrs. T._


DRY TOAST.

Slice thin, some nice, white bread, perfectly sweet. Toast a light
brown, and butter with fresh butter.--_Mrs. S. T._


SCALDED TOAST.

Prepare and toast the bread as above directed. Then lay in a covered
dish and pour boiling water over it. Turn to one side, and drain out
the water. Then put fresh butter on each slice, with a small pinch of
salt. Serve in a covered dish.--_Mrs. S. T._


MILK TOAST.

Slice the bread thin, toast a light brown, butter each side, and
sprinkle with a little salt. Put in a covered dish, and pour over it
boiling milk.--_Mrs. S. T._


CAROLINA SMALL HOMINY.

Wash and pick. Drain, and soak an hour in cold water. Drain again, and
put in a saucepan, with one pint boiling water to one pint hominy.
Boil till dry like rice. Eat with cream, butter and salt, or with
sugar, butter and nutmeg.--_Mrs. S. T._


DISHES SUITABLE FOR THE SICK

May be found in various parts of this work, such as rice pudding,
baked custard, and various preparations of tapioca, sago, and
arrowroot. Grapes are valuable in fever, and also good for chronic
sore-throat.--_Mrs. S. T._


THIEVES' VINEGAR.

A handful of sage and the same of mint, tansy, rue, rosemary,
lavender, and thyme; one ounce of camphor. Put in a gallon demijohn,
and fill with good vinegar. Set in the sun two weeks with a piece of
leather over the mouth, then stop tightly.--_Mrs. D. R._


AROMATIC VINEGAR.

Acetic acid (concentrated), eight ounces; oil of lavender (Eng.), two
drachms; oil of rosemary, one drachm; oil of cloves, one drachm; gum
camphor, one ounce. Dissolve the camphor (bruised) in the acid, then
add perfumes. After standing a few days, with occasional shaking,
strain, and it is ready for use.--_Dr. E. A. C._


SODA MINT.

Bicarb. soda (Eng.), one drachm; pure water, three ounces; spearmint
water, four ounces; glycerine, one ounce; ar. spts. ammonia,
thirty-two drops. Mix and filter. Dose, from twenty drops to a
tablespoonful, according to age.--_Dr. E. A. C._


LIME-WATER.

This is easily prepared, and a bottle should always be kept ready for
use. It is an antidote to many poisons and a valuable remedy in a
sick-room. Put some pieces of unslacked lime in a bottle, fill up with
cold water, keep it corked and in a cool, dark place. It does not
matter about the quantity of lime, as the water will not dissolve more
than a certain quantity. It is ready for use in a few minutes, and the
clear lime-water can be poured off as needed. When all the water is
used, fill up again, which may be done several times before it is
necessary to use fresh lime.--_Mrs. T._


TARRANT'S EFFERVESCENT SELTZER APERIENT.

Is an invaluable remedy for sick headache, nausea, constipation, and
many of the attendant evils of dyspepsia. Directions accompany each
bottle. Colic and other violent pains of the stomach are sometimes
instantly relieved by adding to the dose of Seltzer Aperient a
teaspoonful of Brown's Jamaica Ginger.


BROWN'S JAMAICA GINGER.

Is not only an invaluable remedy, but a refreshing and delightful
drink may be made from it in summer, when iced lemonade would be
unsafe and iced juleps, etc., would be too heating for one suffering
from over-fatigue. Fill a goblet with crushed ice, add two
teaspoonfuls of powdered sugar and one of Jamaica ginger. Fill up with
water, stir and drink.--_Mrs. S. T._


MUSTARD.

It is not safe to pass a day without mustard in the house, so
valuable are its medicinal properties. When a large plaster is wanted,
put into a plate or bowl two tablespoonfuls ground mustard. Wet it
with cold water and stir with a spoon or knife till a smooth paste.
Lay on an inverted tea-board a piece of newspaper twice the size of
the plaster wanted. On one-half spread evenly and thinly the mustard.
Fold over the other half and fold over the edges as if to hem a piece
of cloth, to prevent the mustard from getting on the skin or clothing.
In winter, warm slightly before applying. Keep it on an adult fifteen
minutes; on a child, half that time. In this way, painful blisters
will always be avoided. If the pain is in the chest or stomach, place
the same plaster on the back just opposite, and let it remain on
twenty minutes the second time. Colman's mustard is considered the
best by many persons.


MUSTARD LEAVES OR PLASTERS.

It is well in travelling to carry a package of these plasters, in case
of sudden sickness. It is important also to keep them at home, as
sometimes they are needed suddenly in the night, and even one moment
gained is important in great emergencies. Those manufactured by
Seabury & Johnson, N. Y., are considered excellent and superior to the
foreign article.


COMPOUND SYRUP OF HOREHOUND AND TAR.

Is excellent for coughs, colds, bronchitis, and diseases of the chest.
Manufactured by Faulkner & Craighill, Lynchburg, Va.

strong solution chlorate of potash.--_Mrs. S. T._


_For Sore-Throat._

Carbolic acid, fifteen grains; chlorate potash, thirty grains;
rose-water, one and a half ounces; glycerine, one-half ounce. Use as a
gargle, three or four times daily.--_Mr. E. C._


A CURE FOR EPILEPSY (_one I have known to succeed in many cases_).

Procure the fresh root of a white peony. Scrape and cut in pieces an
inch square. Eat one three times a day, never taking any food after
four P.M. Use a month, stop two weeks and begin again. The best way to
keep the root is to string it on a cord. The red peony will do, if you
cannot get the white.--_Mrs. R. C._


CURE FOR CRAMP.

Wet a cloth in spirits turpentine and lay it over the place where the
pain is felt. If the pain moves, move the cloth. Take five drops
spirits turpentine at a time on white sugar till relieved.--_Mrs. R._


FOR CRAMP-COLIC, OR PAIN RESULTING FROM DISORDERED BOWELS.

One teaspoonful paregoric, one teaspoonful Jamaica ginger, one
teaspoonful spirits camphor, one-half teaspoonful carbonate soda, two
tablespoonfuls water, two tablespoonfuls whiskey. This is for one
dose. If it does not relieve in an hour, repeat.--_Dr. J. T. W._


FOR CHILBLAINS.

Take common furniture glue from the pot, spread it on a linen rag or
piece of brown paper, and apply hot to the chilblain, letting it
remain till the glue wears off.


FOR FRESH CUTS.

Varnish them with common furniture varnish. This remedy has been known
to prove very efficacious.--_Mr. W._


THE OCEAN SALT.

Is now much used by those who cannot go to the seaside. Seventy-five
cents for half a bushel. Dissolve a large handful in a pitcher of
water. Use a sponge to rub the flesh.--_Mrs. A._


BREAST SALVE.

Linseed oil (raw), four ounces; mutton tallow, four ounces; yellow
wax, two ounces; Burgundy pitch, one ounce; Venice turpentine, one
ounce; oil lavender, one-half ounce; rosin, one-half ounce.

Melt together and strain through flannel. Spread lightly on a soft
linen rag, apply to the breast, and the relief is almost
instantaneous.--_Dr. E. A. C._


AN EXCELLENT WASH FOR INFLAMED EYES.

Sulph. zinc, two grains; wine of opium, ten drops; distilled water,
one ounce. Mix. Drop two or three drops in the outer corner of the eye
several times a day.--_Dr. E. A. C._


EYE-WATER FOR WEAK EYES.

One teaspoonful laudanum, two teaspoonfuls Madeira wine, twelve
teaspoonfuls rose-water.--_Mrs. E. I._


FOR EARACHE.

of wool in the mixture, and insert in the ear.--_Dr. E. A. C._


TOOTHACHE DROPS. (_Sure cure._)

Morphia, six grains; half on ounce each of tincture aconite root,
chloroform, laudanum, creosote, oil cloves, cajuput. Add as much gum
camphor as the chloroform will dissolve. Saturate with the above
mixture a piece of wool and put it in the hollow tooth, being certain
that the cavity is cleaned out.--_Dr. E. A. C._


PREVENTIVE OF SCARLET FEVER.

Extract belladonna (pure), three grains; cinnamon-water, one drachm;
distilled water, seven drachms. Mix, label poison, and give the child
for a dose as many drops as the years of his age.--_Dr. E. A. C._


FOR PREVENTING SCARLET FEVER.

Extract belladonna, six grains; cinnamon-water, one drachm; white
sugar, two drachms; alcohol, two drachms; pure water, thirteen
drachms. Mix thoroughly and label belladonna, _poison_. Dose, one drop
for each year of the child's age, repeated twice a day.--_Dr. E. A.
C._


TO RELIEVE "PRICKLY HEAT."

drops, dissolved in a wine-glass of water. Said to be a certain
remedy.--_Mrs. T._


REMEDY FOR CHICKEN CHOLERA.

Dip a small feather or brush into tincture of iodine, hold the
chicken's mouth open, and mop the inside of the throat thoroughly with
the iodine. This treatment has proved successful whenever
tried.--_Mrs. N. G._


MASHED FINGER.

Bind up with old linen and keep constantly wet with cold water. If
there is much pain, add laudanum or tincture of arnica. If
discoloration and swelling remain, after the pain subsides, use
stimulating liniment to encourage a flow of pure blood and the washing
away of the injured blood.


BURNS AND SCALDS.

If the burn or scald is serious, send immediately for a physician. In
the meantime, cover with wet linen cloths, pouring on more water
without removing them, till the pain is alleviated, when pure hog's
lard may be applied, which is one of the best and most easily procured
dressings. If the scald or burn is trifling, this is all that is
needed. Lather of soap from the shaving-cup applied by the brush
often produces relief. White of egg applied in the same way is a
simple and useful dressing. Never tamper with a bad burn. This
requires the skilful treatment of a physician. If the shock is great,
and there is no reaction, administer frequently aromatic spirits of
ammonia or a little brandy and water till the patient rallies.


LINIMENT FOR RECENT BURNS AND SCALDS.

Take equal parts of lime-water, linseed-oil, and laudanum. Mix and
apply on a soft linen rag. Some add about one-quarter quantity
commercial sol. carbolic acid.--_Dr. E. A. C._

Best Turkish rhubarb, one ounce; gentian root, bruised, one-half
ounce; columbo, one-half ounce; orange peel, one-half ounce; fennel
seed, one-half ounce; best French brandy, one quart. This will bear
filling up several times.


FOR WHOOPING-COUGH.

Drop a fresh, unbroken egg in lemon juice. When dissolved, sweeten and
give a spoonful occasionally when the cough comes on.--_Mrs. E. I._


AN EXCELLENT REMEDY FOR COUGHS.

Boil three fresh lemons till quite soft. Then slice them on a pound of
brown sugar. Stew them together fifteen or twenty minutes, or till
they form a rich syrup. When cool, add one tablespoonful oil of sweet
almonds.

Take one spoonful or more when the cough is troublesome.--_N. A. L._


REMEDY FOR COUGHS.

Boil one ounce licorice root in one-half pint of water, till it is
reduced one-half. Then add one ounce gum arabic and one ounce loaf
sugar. Take a teaspoonful every few hours.--_N. A. L._


_Remedy for Coughs._

Boil three lemons for fifteen minutes. Slice them thin while hot over
one pound of loaf sugar. Put on the fire in a porcelain-lined
saucepan and stew till the syrup is quite thick. After taking it from
the fire, add one tablespoonful of oil of sweet almonds. Stir till
thoroughly mixed and cool. If more than a small quantity is desired,
double the above proportions.--_Mrs. J. D. L._


REMEDY FOR ASTHMA, SORE-THROAT, OR A COUGH.

Cut up two or three bulbs of Indian turnip, put the pieces in a quart
bottle, which fill up with good whiskey. Dose, a tablespoonful, three
or four times a day. It is especially desirable to take it just after
rising and just before going to bed. Wonderful cures of asthma have
been effected by this remedy, and many persons living near the writer
have tested its efficacy. The bottle will bear refilling with whiskey
several times. Great care must be taken in procuring the genuine
Indian turnip for this preparation, as there is a poisonous plant much
resembling it.--_Mrs. M. L._


REMEDY FOR POISON OAK.

Make a strong decoction of the leaves or bark of the common willow.
Bathe the parts affected frequently with this decoction, and it will
be found a very efficacious remedy.--_Gen. M._


_Remedy for Poison Oak._

Forty grains caustic potash to five ounces of water. Apply to the
eruption with a small mop, made by tying a soft linen rag to a stick.
Often a speedy cure.--_Mrs. S. T._


CURE FOR JAUNDICE.

Fill a quart bottle a third full of chipped inner cherry bark. Add a
large teaspoonful soda, and fill the bottle with whiskey or brandy.
Take as large a dose three times a day as the system will tolerate. If
it affects the head unpleasantly, lessen the quantity of bark. It will
be fit for use in a few hours.--_Dr. B._


CURE FOR BONE FELON.

One ounce assafoetida in one pint vinegar, as hot as the hand can
bear. Keep it hot by placing the vessel over the top of a teakettle.
Use it frequently through the day, an hour at a time. A painful but
effective remedy.--_Mrs. J. D. P._


FOR TREATING CORNS.

Apply night and morning with a brush one or two drops of protoxide of
iron for two weeks.--_Mrs. W._


CURE FOR CORNS BETWEEN THE TOES.

Wet them several times a day with hartshorn, and in a short time they
will disappear.--_Mrs. W. B._


CARROT SALVE FOR BLISTERS.

Scrape two carrots and stew in two tablespoonfuls hog's lard. Add two
plantain leaves. When the carrots are well done, strain.--_Mrs. E. I._


LINIMENT FOR RHEUMATISM.

Half an ounce gum camphor, half an ounce saltpetre, half an ounce
spirits ammonia, half a pint alcohol. Old-fashioned liniment, good for
man or beast.--_Mrs. T._


A GOOD LINIMENT.

One egg beaten light, half a pint spirits turpentine, half a pint good
apple vinegar. Shake well before using. Good for sprains, cuts, or
bruises.--_Mrs. H._


A GOOD TREATMENT FOR CROUP.

When the child is taken with a hoarse, tight cough, give it
immediately from ten drops to half a teaspoon of hive or croup syrup,
or if you have not these, use ipecac syrup, though this is less rapid
in its effects. Put a mustard plaster on the wind-pipe, and let it
redden the skin, but not blister. Put the feet in mustard-water as hot
as they can bear it. Then wipe them dry and keep them covered warm. A
child from three to six years old will require from ten drops to half
a teaspoon of the syrup every half-hour till relieved. From six to
twelve, give from a half teaspoon to a full teaspoon, according to the
age of the patient. Croup requires very prompt treatment. If home
treatment does not relieve, send immediately for a physician.--_Mrs.
P. W._


TO TAKE QUININE WITHOUT TASTING IT.

Put a little of the mucilage from slippery elm in a teaspoon. Drop the
quinine on it, and put some mucilage on top. This will make the
quinine slip down the throat without leaving any taste.--_Mrs. J. A.
S._


DRESSING FOR BLISTERS.

The first dressing should be of collard leaves, prepared thus. With a
sharp knife carefully pare smooth all the stalk and veining. Then
scald and squeeze each one to a pleasant moisture, keeping them
blood-warm until applied. Second dressing--pure lard or mutton suet
spread evenly and thinly on a soft linen rag.--_Mrs. S. T._


AN EXCELLENT AND SIMPLE SALVE FOR BOILS.

Melt together, in equal parts, the white rosin that exudes from the
common pine tree and mutton suet. This makes a good plaster for the
boil, both before and after it breaks.--_Mrs. S. T._


FOR BOILS.

Slippery elm flour wet with cold water, and put in a soft muslin bag,
and applied to the boil till the inflammation subsides, is an
admirable remedy. Then apply carbolic salve spread on a linen rag,
which is a good dressing for the boil, both before and after it
breaks.--_Mrs. S. T._


TO EXTINGUISH THE FLAMES WHEN THE CLOTHING HAS TAKEN FIRE.

First, throw the person on the ground to prevent the upward flames
from being inhaled. Then quickly roll the person in a carpet
hearth-rug or blanket; if neither is at hand, use any woollen garment,
such as a coat, overcoat, or cloak. Keep the blaze as much as possible
from the face, wrapping the woollen garment first around the neck and
shoulders. Jumping into bed and covering up with the bedclothes is
also a good plan.


FOR WEAK BACK.

Two tablespoonfuls finely powdered rosin, four tablespoonfuls white
sugar, whites of two eggs, one quart best whiskey. Dose, a
tablespoonful three times a day, either before or after meals.
Excellent also for colds or weak lungs; will stop an irritating cough.
Taken half a teaspoonful at a time.--_Mrs. G._


POISONS AND ANTIDOTES.

_Acids_--_Sulphuric_, _Nitric_, _Muriatic_, _Phosphoric_, _Oxalic_,
_Citric_, _Tartaric_, _Acetic_.--Give freely of magnesia or soap-water
(half an ounce white soap to two quarts tepid water). Also very weak
solutions of carbonate of soda or potassa may be used. Give demulcent
drinks and milk-baths, cataplasms, antiphlogistics. Avoid lime-water.

_Alkalies_--_Caustic_, _Potassa_, _Soda_, _Lime_, _Strontia_,
_Baryta_, _and their Carbonates_.--Give diluted vinegar in abundance,
four ounces vinegar to one quart water. Citric or tartaric lemonade,
whites of eggs with tepid water, milk, sweet-oil. Baths, lotions,
fomentations.

_Arsenic._--Prompt emetic. Give freely of hydrated peroxide of iron;
dose, half an ounce, frequently repeated. If this is not at hand, give
magnesia in large quantities of tepid water. Demulcent drinks, baths,
and counter-irritants over the stomach to relieve spasms.

_Carbolic Acid._--Saccharated lime in water; also demulcent drinks.

_Chloral._--Keep the patient warm in bed, with hot blankets and hot
water bottles, the bottles also to be applied over the heart. A warm
bath may be of advantage. If respiration threatens to fail, maintain
it artificially, and apply galvanic battery (induced current), one
pole over pit of stomach and the other over lower cervical vertebrae.

_Chloroform._--Draw out the tongue, if retracted. Give plenty of air.
Raise the body and lower the head, till the body is almost inverted.
Maintain artificial respiration. Use the galvanic battery as above
directed.

_Copper_, Salts of.--Cause vomiting, and then give freely of whites of
eggs and water, demulcent drinks, soothing clysters, lotions,
fomentations. Avoid vinegar.

_Corrosive Sublimate._--First, cause vomiting, then give whites of
eggs in water, four whites to one quart water. Milk, demulcent drinks,
and gargles.

_Gases._--The antidote for chlorine is to inhale ammonia. Asphyxia by
other gases, treated by cold applications to the head, plenty of air,
artificial respiration.

_Glass_, in powder.--Farina or light food in abundance. Then an
emetic, then milk and demulcent drinks.

_Iodine._--Starch-water containing albumen in large quantities, or
starch-water alone.

_Lead_, Salts of.--White of eggs, epsom salts, or sulphuric acid
lemonade. (One drachm diluted acid to a quart sweetened water.)

_Nitrate of Silver_ (lunar caustic).--Give salt water freely.

_Opium and Salts of Morphine._--Cause free vomiting by sulphate of
zinc, sulphate of copper, and tartar emetic, and use the stomach-pump.
Then administer one-sixteenth grain atropine, hypodermically, and
repeat with caution till the pupils dilate. Also give strong coffee or
tea. Keep the patient awake. If depression and drowsiness are extreme,
bleeding may do the patient good.

_Phosphorus._--Emetic, then water with whites of eggs, magnesia in
suspension, milk. Avoid oils.

_Prussic Acid._--Affusions of water over the cervical vertebrae.
Cause the gas from chlorine water to be inhaled. Give from twenty to
forty drops of Labbaraque's solution largely diluted, also coffee.

_Strychnine._--Cause vomiting. Give ether or chloroform by inhalation,
and chloral internally. Insufflate the lungs.

_Tartar Emetic._--If there is vomiting, favor it by giving whites of
eggs with water in large quantities, then give infusion of gall or oak
bark. If vomiting is not free, use the stomach-pump.

_Venomous Bites_, Serpents.--Apply a moderately tight ligature above
the bite. Wash the wound freely with warm water to encourage bleeding,
then cauterize thoroughly. Afterwards apply lint dipped in equal parts
of olive-oil and spirits hartshorn. Internally give freely of
alcoholic stimulants, with liquid ammonia, largely diluted.

_Rabid Dogs._--Apply ligature as above described, wash the wound
thoroughly with warm water, and cauterize immediately with nitric acid
or lunar caustic, leaving no part of the wound untouched.




HOUSE-CLEANING.


Do not clean but one room at a time, as it is a bad plan to have the
whole house in confusion at once. It is best to commence with the
attic.

Before beginning on your spring cleaning, remove the curtains, all the
movable furniture, and the carpets. With a broom and dust-pan remove
all dust from the floor. Then with a wall-brush thoroughly sweep and
dust the ceiling and side-walls, window and door frames, pictures and
chandeliers. Then go over the floor again, removing the dust that has
fallen from the ceiling and walls. Then proceed to wash all the paint
in the room. If it be white paint, use whiting or such other
preparations as are recommended for the purpose in the subsequent
pages. If it be varnished, or in imitation of oak or walnut, wipe with
a cloth dipped in milk-warm water. If the wood work in the room be of
unvarnished walnut or oak, wipe it off first, and then oil it, rubbing
in the oil well.

Then with a soft flannel rag and a cake of sapolio clean every piece
of marble in the room. Next wipe the mirrors carefully with a flannel
rag, wrung out of warm water and dipped in a little whiting, or you
may rub a little silver soap on the rag. The gilding must be merely
dusted, as the least dampness or a drop of water will injure it.

The windows (sash and all) must then be washed in soap and water, with
a common brush such as is used for washing paint. A little soda
dissolved in the water will improve the appearance of the windows. It
is unnecessary to use such a quantity of soap and water as to splash
everything around. After being washed, the windows should be polished
with newspapers. Except in a general house-cleaning, windows may be
cleaned by the directions given above for mirrors.

The metal about the door-knobs, tongs, etc., may be cleaned by
electro-silicon, and the grates may be varnished with the black
varnish kept for the purpose by dealers in grates, stoves, etc. Every
chair and article of furniture should be carefully cleaned before
being brought back into the room, and linen covers should be put on
the chairs. If you are going to put down matting, do so before
bringing back the first article of furniture. Some housekeepers,
however, allow their matting to remain during the winter under their
carpets. Spots on matting may be removed by being scoured with a
cloth, dipped first in hot water and then in salt. This, however, will
cause wet spots to appear on it in damp weather. After the spots are
removed, scrub the matting with dry corn-meal and a coarse cloth.
Sweep it over several times, till all the meal is removed.

For persons who do not use matting in summer, a recipe is given later
for beautifully coloring the floor with boiled linseed oil and burnt
sienna. Where different woods are used alternately in the floor, this
oil answers better than revarnishing the floor every spring.

As soon as the carpets are taken up, have them nicely shaken, swept,
and brushed on both sides. Every spot should be carefully washed and
wiped dry. The carpets should then be rolled up smoothly, with tobacco
sprinkled between the folds, sewed up in coarse linen cloths, and put
away till autumn. A cedar closet is an excellent place to keep carpets
as well as other woollens. If you have no cedar closet, however, a
cedar chest will serve to protect your woollen clothes against moths,
and it is better to preserve them in this way than to sprinkle them
with tobacco, which imparts an unpleasant scent to them.


WHITEWASH FOR OUTDOOR USE.

Take good quick-lime in lumps. Slack it with hot water, and while
slacking add to what will make a pailful one pound tallow or other
grease, free from dirt. It may be rancid, smoked, or otherwise unfit
for kitchen use.

When the violent slacking is over, stir thoroughly. All the water
should be added before the slacking ceases, and the mixing together
should be thorough. Do not dilute with cold water. If well made, it
will be very smooth and but little affected by rain.--_Mrs. E._


INDOOR WHITEWASHING.

We have recently seen recommended in a journal a fine and brilliant
whitewash preparation of chalk, called "Paris White," and said to be
admirable for whitewashing walls. It sells in paint stores at three
cents per pound, retail. For every sixteen pounds Paris White, get
half a pound white transparent glue. Cover the glue with cold water at
night, and in the morning heat it, without scorching, till dissolved.
Stir in the Paris White with hot water to give it a milky consistency.
Then add and mix well the glue. Apply with a common lime whitewash
brush. A single coating will do, except on very dingy walls. Almost as
brilliant as "Zinc White."--_Mrs. S. T._


TO OIL FLOORS.

To one gallon boiled linseed oil add half a pound burnt sienna. The
druggist who sells these articles will mix them. If economy is
necessary, instead of employing a painter to put it on, dip a large
woollen rag into the mixture, and with this wipe over the
floor.--_Mrs. S. T._


TO DYE FLOORS A PRETTY COLOR.

Make a strong decoction of the inside bark of red oak. Set it a dark
color with copperas.

Have the floors well swept and cleaned of spots. Then with a cloth rub
the dye in well, taking care to wipe up and down the floor, so as to
prevent streaking.

Let it dry, then wipe over with weak lye, and as soon as this dries
off, rub with a waxed brush.--_Mrs. Dr. P. C._


TO CLEAN PAINT.

Wring out a clean flannel, take up as much powdered whiting as will
adhere to it, then rub the paint. Wash off with clean water and rub
dry with a soft cloth, and it will look new. Not for paint in
imitation of oak.--_Mrs. R._


TO WASH OIL-CLOTH.

Wash oil-cloths with salt water; say, one pint salt dissolved in a
pailful water. When dry wipe over with a little milk and water.--_Mrs.
H. D._


_To Wash Oil-Cloth._

Sweep it well. Wash with cold water, using a brush. Then wash with
milk and wipe dry. Never use hot water.--_Mrs. R._


TO WASH CARPETS.

Shake, beat, and sweep well. Tack firmly on the floor. Mix three
quarts soft, cold water with one quart beef's gall. Wash with a
flannel, rub off with a clean flannel, immediately after putting it on
each strip of carpet.--_Mrs. R._

Carpets should be washed in spots, with a brush or flannel, one
tablespoonful ox-gall in one or two quarts water.--_Mrs. A._


TO REMOVE INK FROM CARPETS.

Take up the ink with a spoon. Pour cold water on the stained spot,
take up the water with a spoon, and repeat this process frequently.
Then rub on a little oxalic acid and wash off immediately with cold
water. Then wet with hartshorn.--_Mrs. R._


TO CLEAN MARBLE SLABS, ETC.

Sal soda, four ounces; powdered pumice-stone, two ounces; prepared
chalk, two ounces. Mix well, add sufficient water, rub well on the
marble, and then wash with soap and water.--_Dr. E. A. C._

Sapolio, rubbed on a flannel rag which has just been dipped in hot
water and squeezed, is also good for cleaning marble.--_Mrs. S. T._


TO REMOVE GREASE FROM WALL PAPER.

Dip a flannel in spirits of wine and go carefully over the soiled
places once or twice.--_Mrs. R._


TO CLEAN FURNITURE.

One-half pint linseed oil, one half pint vinegar, one-half pint
turpentine. Apply with a flannel rag, and then rub with a dry
flannel.--_Mrs. H. S._


TO CLEAN VARNISHED FURNITURE, MAHOGANY ESPECIALLY.

Wash the piece of furniture with warm water and soap, and then rub
dry; afterwards take a flannel rag, and rub with the following
mixture: equal proportions of vinegar, sweet-oil, and spirits of
turpentine, in a bottle which must be shaken before using.--_Mrs.
McG._


AN EXCELLENT FURNITURE POLISH.

Alcohol, three ounces; linseed oil, boiled, two ounces; oxalic acid,
one drachm; gum shellac, two drachms; gum benzoin, two drachms; rosin,
two drachms. Dissolve the gums in the alcohol, and then add oil and
oxalic acid. Apply with a woollen cloth.--_Dr. E. A. C._


_Furniture Polish._

One pint of alcohol, one pint of spirits of turpentine, one and
one-half pint of raw linseed oil, one ounce balsam fir, one ounce
ether. Cut the balsam with the alcohol, which will take about twelve
hours. [That is to say, dilute the balsam with the alcohol.] Mix the
oil with the turpentine in a separate vessel and add the alcohol, and
last the ether.--_G. C. W._


TO CLEAN SILVER.

There is nothing better for this purpose than Colgate's Silver Soap,
and Robinson's Indexical Silver Soap, made in Boston. After the silver
has been cleaned, according to the directions accompanying each
package of the aforementioned kinds of soap, wash it in a pan of hot
water in which a tablespoonful of ammonia has been poured.--_Mrs. S.
T._


_To Clean Silver._

Make a paste of whiting and spirits of wine. Put it on with a soft
cloth, then rub it off also with a soft cloth, and polish with chamois
skin.--_Mrs. R._


TO REMOVE EGG STAINS FROM SILVER SPOONS.

Rub with salt, and it will entirely remove the discoloration produced
by eating a boiled egg with a silver spoon. Rubbing with salt will
also remove the grayish streaks that collect on white tea-china by
careless usage.--_Mrs. M. C. C._


TO CLEAN BRASSES, ETC.

Electro-silicon, manufactured by J. Seth Hopkins & Co., Baltimore, is
the best article that can be procured for this purpose. The price is
twenty-five cents per box, with full directions for use. It may be
procured of any druggist. If not convenient to get it, use powdered
brick-dust.--_Mrs. S. T._


FOR THE KITCHEN.

Sapolio, manufactured by Enoch Morgan & Sons, should be in every
kitchen. It is invaluable for cleaning tins, iron-ware, knobs, and is
so neat a preparation that it does not blacken the hands.


THE DOVER EGG-BEATER.

Is indispensable to housekeepers. It froths eggs in less than a fourth
of the time a spoon or an ordinary egg-beater requires to froth
them.--_Mrs. S. T._


TO REMOVE RUST FROM KNIVES OR ANY STEEL.

Rub very hard with a piece of wash leather, dipped in powdered
charcoal, moistened with spirits of wine. Rub off quickly, wash in hot
water, and renew as may be necessary.--_Mrs. K._


TO CLEAN KNIVES, TINS, ETC.

Crystal Kitchen Soap, manufactured by Eastman & Brooke, Philadelphia,
is excellent for this purpose, being so neat a compound that the
knives and coffee-pot, as well as the tins used in the preparation of
breakfast, may be quickly cleaned at the table while the tea-china is
being washed.

When not convenient to obtain the Crystal Kitchen Soap, knives may be
cleaned with ashes either of coal or wood.--_Mrs. S. T._


TO WHITEN THE IVORY ON THE HANDLES OF KNIVES.

The ivory handles of knives sometimes become yellow from being allowed
to remain in dish-water. Rub them with sandpaper till white. If the
blades have become rusty from careless usage, rub them also with
sandpaper and they will look as nice as new.--_Mrs. S. T._


MIXTURE FOR SHADING GLASS.

Spanish whiting, one pound; white glue, one-quarter pound; litharge,
one ounce; alum, one ounce. Boil the glue and alum in a sufficient
quantity of water. Let it cool, then add the whiting and litharge.
Stir well and use at once. It may be washed or scraped off, if
desired.--_Dr. E. A. C._


CEMENT FOR RUBBER AND GLASS.

Pulverized gum shellac in ten times its weight of strong spirits
hartshorn.--_Dr. E. A. C._


TO DESTROY BEDBUGS.

Dissolve one ounce corrosive sublimate in one pint strong spirits. Put
it on the bedsteads with a feather, and it will destroy the bugs and
their eggs also.--_Mrs. Dr. P. C._


BEDBUG POISON.

Alcohol, two and a half pints; camphor, one ounce; spirits turpentine,
one ounce; corrosive sublimate, half an ounce. Mix and dissolve. If
the scent is not objectionable, two ounces commercial carbolic acid
will greatly improve the above.--_Dr. E. A. C._


TO DESTROY BUGS, ANTS, ETC.

Dissolve two pounds alum in three quarts boiling water. Apply boiling
hot with a brush. Add alum to whitewash for store-rooms, pantries, and
closets. It is well to pound alum fine and sprinkle it about beds
infested with bugs.--_Mrs. S. T._


REMEDY FOR RED ANTS.

Kerosene oil is a sure remedy for red ants. Place small blocks under a
sugar barrel, so as not to let the oil touch the barrel.--_Mrs. J. W._

Cayenne pepper will keep the store-room and pantry free from ants and
cockroaches.--_Mrs. S. D._


REMEDY FOR MOSQUITOES OR OTHER BLOOD-SUCKING INSECTS.

Uncork a bottle of oil of pennyroyal, and it will drive them away, nor
will they return so long as the scent of it is in the room.--_Mrs. S.
D._

For the stings of insects, wasps, hornets, bees, etc. Apply to the
place soda, hartshorn, or arnica.


RATS.

Mix a little powdered potash with meal and throw it into the rat-holes
and it will not fail to drive the rats away. If a mouse enters into
any part of your dwelling, saturate a rag with cayenne in solution and
stuff it into his hole.--_Mrs. S. D._


CONCENTRATED LYE SOAP.

All fat and grease from the kitchen should be carefully saved, and
should be made into soap before accumulating and becoming offensive.

Boil for six hours ten gallons of lye made of green wood ashes. Then
add eight or ten pounds of grease, and continue to boil it. If thick
or ropy, add more lye till the grease is absorbed. This is ascertained
by dropping a spoonful in a glass of water, and if grease remains it
will show on the water.

If hard soap is desired, put one quart of salt in half-gallon of hot
water. Stir till dissolved and pour into the boiling soap. Boil twenty
minutes, stirring continually. Remove from the fire, and when cold cut
in cakes and dry. A box of concentrated lye may be used instead of
salt, as it will obviate the necessity of using more dripped lye to
consume the grease.--_Mrs. P. W._


A WASHING MIXTURE.

Mix and boil twenty minutes one gallon soft soap; half a gallon of
weak boiled lye; four ounces sal soda; half a gill of spirits
turpentine. Soak the clothes overnight in milk-warm water. In the
morning, rinse and wring them. To every gallon cold water add one
pint of the above mixture. Stir it well in the water. Open the clothes
and boil fifteen or twenty minutes; rinse out of those suds. If the
articles are not thoroughly cleansed, rub a little of the mixture on
the soiled places, and the result will be satisfactory.--_Mrs. Dr. E._




RECIPES FOR RESTORING OLD CLOTHES, SETTING COLORS, REMOVING STAINS,
ETC.


FOR CLEANING CLOTHES.

Castile soap, one ounce; aqua ammonia (34), a quarter-pound; sulphur
ether, one ounce; glycerine, one ounce; spirits wine, one ounce. Shave
the soap into thin pieces, dissolve it in two quarts rain (or any
other soft water). Then add the other ingredients. Rub the soiled
spots with a sponge or piece of flannel and expose to the air.--_Mrs.
B._


SOAP TO REMOVE GREASE FROM CLOTH.

Detersive soap, three pounds; alcohol, two pints; oxalic acid, half an
ounce; essential oil to flavor. First bring the alcohol to a boil,
then gradually add the soap (pared in thin shavings) and stir
constantly. Then add the acid and oil, pour into moulds while hot, and
let it cool. You may, of course, make it in smaller quantities,
observing the same relative proportions.--_Dr. E. A. C._


_To Remove Spots from Cloth._

Aqua ammonia, two ounces; alcohol, two ounces; spirits camphor, one
ounce; transparent soap, one ounce; rain-water, one quart.--_Mr. E.
C., Jr._


TO WASH BLACK CASHMERE.

Wash in hot suds, with a little borax in the water. Rinse in bluing
water, and iron very damp.


TO RESTORE THE PILE OF VELVET.

Heat a large flat-iron, place it in a pan, and lay on it a wet cloth.
The steam will rise rapidly. Hold the right side of the velvet over
it. If this does not restore the pile, wet it on the wrong side. Have
a smooth flat-iron very hot. Set it on the edge of the table, upright.
If it is a narrow piece of velvet, it may be easily ironed by passing
the wet side against the iron. If a large piece, have some one to hold
the bottom of the iron upwards while the wet side of the velvet is
passed over it.--_Mrs. S. T._


TO RESTORE OLD BLACK SILK.

Pour one pint boiling water on two tablespoonfuls gum arabic. When a
little cooled, add one teaspoonful spirits turpentine and the same of
spirits ammonia. With a large sponge wipe the silk on both sides with
this mixture. Then lay the silk on an ironing-table, place over it a
thin piece of colored rice cambric, and iron it very hard with a hot
iron. This makes old silk look like new.--_Mrs. S. T._


TO FRESHEN OLD BLACK SILK.

Boil one ounce crushed soap bark in one quart water till reduced to
one pint. Strain it; sponge the material with the liquid, and while
wet iron on the wrong side. Good for black woollens also.--_Mrs. M. E.
L. W._


TO RENEW BLACK CRAPE VEILS.

Wring two large towels out of water. Then put the veil (folded across
the middle, lengthways) on the lower towel; spread the other on top
and roll the veil, when between, in a small tight roll. Let it stand
an hour, or till it is damp through. Take it out and air it a little
before it dries. Fold it then in smooth squares, put it in a large
book, such as an atlas, put heavy weights on it, and let it stand an
hour or two.--_Mrs. M. C. C._


TO SET COLORS.

Wash in strong salt or alum water and rinse in water in which Irish
potatoes have been sliced and boiled, to stiffen.

A strong tea of hay or fodder preserves the color of brown linen. One
spoonful gall to a gallon of water will set the colors of almost any
goods. A teaspoonful sugar of lead in a gallon cold water (some say a
tablespoonful in a quart soft water) will set colors. Let the material
soak in it an hour.

A teacup of lye in a pail of water will improve black calicoes.


TO RESTORE COLORS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN OUT.

Rub the spots with hartshorn and place in the sun till dry.


TO KEEP BLUE CALICOES BRIGHT AND FRESH.

The first time they are washed, put them in water with a cupful
spirits of turpentine to each pail of water. This will set the color,
and they will always look well.


MILDEW.

Moisten the mildewed spot with clear water, then rub over it a thick
coating of castile soap. Scrape chalk with the soap, mixing and
rubbing with the end of the finger. Then wash it off. Sometimes one
coating suffices, but generally several are required.


LABARAQUE SOLUTION.

Will remove mildew, ink, or almost any fruit stain from cloth. The
solution should be washed off soon after applying, as it may injure
the cloth.--_Dr. E. A. C._


TO PREVENT FRUIT STAINS FROM BEING PERMANENT.

Wet the stained spot with whiskey before sending it to wash, and there
will be no sign of it when the article comes in.


FOR REMOVING FRUIT OR INK STAINS.

Two drachms chloride of lime, two drachms acetic acid, one and a half
ounce water. Mix well.--_Dr. E. A. C._


IRON RUST.

Salts of lemon applied to the place and exposed to the sun will remove
all iron rust in linen, etc.




MISCELLANEOUS RECIPES.


AMMONIA.

No housekeeper should be without a bottle of spirits of ammonia, for,
besides its medical value, it is highly useful for household purposes.
It is nearly as useful as soap, and its cheapness brings it in the
reach of all. Put a teaspoonful ammonia in a quart of warm soapsuds,
dip in a flannel cloth, wipe off the dust and fly-specks, and see how
much scrubbing it will save you.

For washing windows and mirrors, it is very desirable. A few drops on
a piece of paper will take off every spot or fingermark on the glass.

It cleanses and brightens silver wonderfully. Dip your forks, spoons,
etc., in a pint of suds, mixed with a teaspoonful spirits ammonia.
Then rub with a brush and polish with chamois skin.

It will take grease spots from every fabric. Put on the ammonia nearly
clear. Lay blotting-paper on the place, and press a hot flat-iron on
it a few moments. A few drops of it will clean and whiten laces, also
muslins.

It is highly useful and refreshing at the toilet-table. A few drops in
the bath will remove all offensive perspiration and glossiness (if the
skin is oily). Nothing is better for cleansing the hair from dust and
dandruff. A teaspoonful in a pint of water will cleanse the dirtiest
brushes. Shake the brushes through the water, and when they look
white, rinse them in water and put them in the sunshine or a warm
place to dry.

For medicinal purposes ammonia is almost unrivalled. Inhaling it will
often cure headache and catarrhal cold. Ten drops aromatic spirits of
ammonia in a wine-glass of water is excellent for heartburn or
dyspepsia. The ordinary spirits of ammonia may be used also for the
purpose, but it is not so palatable.

Ammonia is also good for vegetation. If you desire roses, fuschias,
geraniums, etc., to become more flourishing, add five or six drops
ammonia to every pint of lukewarm water you give them. Do not repeat
this more than once in five or six days, lest you should stimulate
them too highly.

Be sure to keep a large bottle of ammonia in the house, and use a
glass stopper for it, as it is very evanescent and is injurious to
corks.

[The above remarks on the usefulness of ammonia were furnished and
endorsed by Mrs. A. D., of Virginia.]


BORAX.

It is very desirable to keep borax in the house. Its effect is to
soften the hardest water, and it is excellent for cleansing the hair.
Some washerwomen use borax for a washing powder, instead of soda, in
the proportion of a handful of borax powder to ten gallons boiling
water, and they save in soap nearly half, whilst the borax, being a
neutral salt, does not injure the texture of the linen.--_Mrs. S. T._


RED INK.

Bicarb. potash, half an ounce; cochineal, half an ounce; bitart.
potash, half an ounce; powdered alum, half an ounce; pure rain-water,
four ounces. Mix, and add ten drops creosote.--_Dr. E. A. C._


BLACK INK.

Extract logwood (pulv.), two ounces; hot rain-water, one gallon.
Simmer over water-bath one hour, till logwood is dissolved. Put into a
bottle the following: bichromate potass., one hundred grains; prus.
of potass., forty grains; warm rain-water, four ounces. Shake till
dissolved, put into the logwood solution, stir well together, strain
through flannel, and, when cold, add corrosive sublimate, ten grains;
warm rain-water, one ounce. Dissolve thoroughly, put with the above,
and add pure carbolic acid crys., one drachm. This makes the best
black ink in the world, at a cost of about ten cents a gallon.--_Dr.
E. A. C._


COMMON BOTTLE WAX.

Rosin, eighteen ounces; shellac, one ounce; beeswax, two ounces. Melt
together and color to suit the fancy.--_Dr. E. A. C._


GRAFTING WAX.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
