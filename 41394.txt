INTRODUCTION

The idea of a bulletin on Michigan trees was first suggested by Prof.
Volney M. Spalding. It was thought that a bulletin devoted entirely to
the study of certain phases of tree life in Michigan would stimulate
interest in the study of our trees, and influence many more people to
associate themselves with the growing number of tree lovers and with the
supporters of the movement for better forest conditions in the state.

The bulletin has been under consideration for a number of years and much
of the material given herein has been used in the classes in forest
botany at the University of Michigan. It remained, however, for the
present Curator of the Botanical Garden and Arboretum to get the
material into shape for publication, and the present bulletin is the
result of his industry and perseverance. The preparation of the drawings
and manuscript has been made by him in connection with his work in the
Garden.

The distinctive feature of the bulletin lies in its keys. The keys
commonly published are based upon characters which are present but a
short time during the year, or which can be used only by an advanced
student of botany. This bulletin presents two keys. One is based upon
characters which are present all summer; the other uses the winter
characters as a basis for identification. By the use of the keys any
person should be able to name and learn the characteristics of the trees
of Michigan at any time of the year. These keys should prove of special
value to our students in the public schools, to members of nature study
clubs, and to the students in the forestry schools of the state.

The order of arrangement and the nomenclature are essentially those of
"Gray's New Manual of Botany." Following a tendency which is steadily
gaining favor, all species names are printed with a small letter,
regardless of their origin. For the convenience of the general reader,
other scientific names which are found in botanical manuals _in common
use_ are printed in parenthesis. In the case of exotics which are not
included in the Manual, other authorities have been followed. Sudworth's
"Check List of the Forest Trees of the United States" (U. S. Dept. Agr.,
Div. Forestry, Bul. 17) is in most cases authority for the common names.
They are names appearing in common use today in some part of the state.
The first name given is that recommended by Sudworth for general use.

The drawings have been made from living or herbarium material and are
original. They are accurately drawn to a scale, which is given in each
case. In their preparation the author has endeavored to call attention
to the salient characters. In the drawings of buds and twigs certain
points, bundle-scars, etc., have been emphasized more than is natural.
In the descriptions the attempt has been made to bring out those points
of similarity and contrast which are most useful for identification.

As the bulletin is not written especially for technical students of
botany, the author thought best to use as few technical terms as
possible in the descriptions. In some cases it was impossible to avoid
such terms, but with the help of the glossary the meaning can be easily
understood. Any person desiring to get a more complete knowledge of
trees should consult one of the larger manuals. The arrangement used for
the illustration and discussion of each single tree makes it possible
for the student to compare the drawings with the description without
turning a page.

It is believed that with the aid of the drawings and descriptions given
in this bulletin any person will be able to name the trees which grow in
his yard, park, or woodlot. If, however, any difficulty is found in
naming the trees, the Curator will be glad to name any specimens which
may be mailed to him. He would be glad to get in touch with persons
interested in Michigan trees and to receive any additional information
relating to the subject. Data concerning the distribution of the trees
in the state, and the addition of other Michigan trees to the present
list would be of especial value.

HOW TO STUDY THE TREES

People are everywhere associated with trees. Trees give cooling shade in
our parks and dooryards and along our highways; they lend their beauty
to the landscape and relieve it of monotony; they yield many kinds of
fruits, some of which furnish man and the animals of the forest with
food; and they furnish vast quantities of lumber for a multitude of
uses. How important it is, then, that every person, whether school-child
or grown-up, should become acquainted with our trees. Most people know a
few of our commonest trees, but are ignorant of the great wealth of tree
forms about them. Some who may have wished to go further have been
hindered for lack of a teacher or dismayed by the very multitude of
manuals to which they have had access.

In beginning a study of the trees the student should start on a solid
foundation, eliminating the uncertainties and the errors which no doubt
have appeared and retaining only the established facts. Once started he
should go slowly, assimilating each new discovery before seeking
another. He should begin with the trees nearest home, and, as he
gradually grows to know these in all their aspects, should extend his
trips afield. Not only should he be able to name the trees when they are
fully clothed in their summer dress, but he should as readily know these
same trees when the leaves have fallen and only the bare branches stand
silhouetted against the sky. Then, and only then, will he derive the
utmost satisfaction from his efforts.

The characters which are used in studying the trees are habit, leaves,
flowers, fruit, buds, bark, distribution and habitat. These will be
discussed briefly in the next few pages, the same order that is used in
the detailed descriptions of species being maintained in the present
discussion. A few drawings will also be added to make clear certain
points and to show comparative forms.

NAME.--Every tree has one or several common names and a scientific or
Latin name. Some of these common names are merely local, others have a
more extended use. Some few names apply to totally different species.
Thus, Cottonwood in Michigan is _Populus deltoides_, in Idaho and
Colorado _Populus angustifolia_, in California _Populus fremontii_ and
in Kentucky _Tilia heterophylla_. While it should not be forgotten that
in common speech it is proper as well as convenient to call trees by
their common names, yet, in view of the many uncertainties pertaining to
their use, a scientific name is at times absolutely essential to the
clear understanding of what is meant. Latin is the language in universal
use by all scientists. No longer used by any civilized nation, it has
become a dead language and consequently never changes. Its vocabulary
and its constructions will a thousand years hence be the same as they
are today. Being in universal use among scientists of all nationalities
no confusion arises from the use of a Latin word. The Oak in Germany is
known as _Eiche_, in France as _chene_ and in Spain as _roble_, but the
Latin word _Quercus_ is the same for all these countries.

A scientific name as applied to trees consists of at least two parts, as
_Quercus alba_; the first named is the genus and is always written with
a capital letter, the second is the species and is written with a small
letter, the two names constituting the briefest possible description of
the particular tree. It is customary to add to these the name or an
abbreviation of the name of the person who first gave the name to the
tree, as _Quercus alba L._, the abbreviation standing for Linnaeus.
Sometimes a third name is used, as _Acer saccharum nigrum_, referring in
this case to a variety of the ordinary Sugar Maple.

Genera which bear a relationship to each other are placed in the same
family, the family name always having the characteristic ending--_aceae_.
Related families are again grouped into orders, with the characteristic
ending--_ales_. Orders are in like manner arranged into larger groups,
called classes, and the latter into still larger groups, divisions,
etc., each with its characteristic ending. Thus, _Acer saccharum nigrum_
(_Michx. f._) _Britt_. is classified as follows:

   Division--Spermatophyta
     Subdivision--Angiospermae
       Class--Dicotyledoneae
         Order--Sapindales
           Family--Aceraceae
             Genus--Acer
               Species--saccharum
                 Variety--nigrum.

HABIT.--Habit, or the general appearance of a plant, is an important
character of identification, especially as we become more and more
familiar with the trees. Two main types are recognized, based on the
manner of branching of the trunk, the upright and the spreading. In the
one the trunk extends straight upwards without dividing, as is typical
in most of the conifers, and in the other the trunk divides to form
several large branches and the broad, spreading crown of most of our
broad-leaf trees. The crown in either case may be regular in outline or
very irregular, straggling or straight-limbed. Moreover, the tree
growing in the open, where there is no crowding and there is plenty of
light, may differ very greatly from the tree in the forest, where the
struggle for existence becomes very keen. A short, thick trunk and low,
spreading, many-branched crown characterizes the tree in the open,
whereas the forest tree has a long, slender, clean trunk and a narrow
crown of few branches. In the descriptions of trees in this bulletin,
unless otherwise stated, the habit in the open is the one given. Again,
the tree may have been injured by storm or insect at some period of its
growth and its natural symmetry destroyed. Moreover, the age of a tree
has a great influence on its outline, young trees being generally narrow
and more or less conical, broadening out as they become older. We may
say, then, that each tree has an individuality of its own, little
eccentricities similar to those that make people different from one
another. And just as we have little difficulty in recognizing our
friends at a distance by some peculiarity of walk or action, so are we
able to recognize a great many trees at a distance by some peculiarity
of form or habit.

LEAVES.--With the advent of spring the buds of our broad-leaf trees swell
and burst and the leaves come forth and clothe the trees with mantles of
green, hiding the branches which have been bare through the cold winter
months. The evergreens, too, take on new color and begin a new period
of growth. It is the leaves which the beginner finds most interesting
and in which he finds a ready means of identification. It must be
remembered, however, that leaves vary greatly in size and shape and
general appearance. How large are the leaves on a flourishing sprout and
how small on a stunted tree of the same species growing near by, but
under adverse circumstances. How different are the leaves of the big
white oak standing in the yard; they are hardly lobed on the lowermost
branches, while higher up they are deeply cut. Yet, in spite of the many
modifications that leaves undergo, the leaves of any one species have
certain rather constant characters which are found in all forms, and the
student will have little difficulty in selecting and recognizing typical
leaves.

[Illustration: III. LEAF MARGINS

Leaves are either persistent, as in most of our conifers, which stay
green all winter, or they turn various colors with the frost and fall
early in autumn; often they hang dead and lifeless far into the winter.
The points about leaves which we are accustomed to consider are the
position or arrangement of the leaves on the branch, whether simple or
compound, size, shape, texture, color, amount and character of
pubescence, character of the margin, venation, etc. The following
diagrams will serve to illustrate some of the ordinary forms and shapes
of leaves, their margins, etc.

FLOWERS.--Every tree when old enough bears flowers in its proper season.
Some of these, as the Catalpas, Locusts and Horse-chestnuts are very
showy, others, like the Oaks and Hickories, are comparatively
inconspicuous; some are brilliantly colored, others are of the same
color as the leaves. Nevertheless, the flowers are very accurate means
of classification, and their only drawback is that they last for such a
short period of time each year.

[Illustration: V. TYPES OF INFLORESCENCES

Spike. Raceme. Panicle. Corymb. Umbel. Cyme.]

Just as we have male and female in the animal world, so we have male and
female in the plant world. A few of our trees, as the Locust, Basswood
and Cherries have perfect flowers, bearing both stamens and pistil. The
great majority, however, have unisexual flowers, bearing stamens or
pistils, but not both. When both male and female flowers are found on
the same tree, the flowers are said to be monoecious, and when male
flowers occur on one tree and the female on a different tree, the
flowers are said to be dioecious. The Cottonwood is dioecious, and the
little seeds are surrounded by a tuft of long, white hairs which enables
the wind to carry them to considerable distances from the parent tree,
to the disgust of people living within range. Many cities forbid the
planting of Cottonwood on account of the "cotton." Since in some cases
it is desirable to plant this rapid-growing tree, as in cities burning
large amounts of soft coal, it is a distinct advantage to know that male
trees are lacking in the objectionable "cotton" and may be planted
safely.

Before trees can produce fruit their flowers must be fertilized, i.e.,
pollen from the anther of a stamen must come in contact with the stigma
of a pistil. Some flowers are self-fertilized, others are
cross-fertilized. For a long time it was not known how fertilization was
accomplished, but now we know that many insects, like the nectar-loving
bees and butterflies, and in other cases the wind transport the pollen
from one flower to another, often miles being traversed before the right
kind of flower or a flower in the right stage of development is found.
And many are the modifications of flowers to insure this transference of
pollen.

FRUIT.--So numerous and so varied are the forms of tree fruits that it
would only be confusing to enumerate their various characters. Some
fruits, as the achenes of the Poplars and Willows, are so small and
light that they are carried long distances by the wind; others, like the
hickory nuts and walnuts, are too heavy to be wind-blown. Many fruits
are of considerable economic and commercial importance and are gathered
and marketed on a large scale; such are the hickory nuts, walnuts,
chestnuts, etc. Some, not esteemed by man, form an important article of
diet for the birds and small animals of the forest. Unfortunately, there
are a number of limitations to the usefulness of fruit for
identification purposes. Some trees require years to mature their fruit.
Many trees, while producing an abundance of fruit at certain intervals,
bear none at all or only very small and uncertain quantities between the
years of abundance. Again, in the case of dioecious trees, only the
female or pistillate bear fruit. Notwithstanding these limitations tree
fruits are a very valuable aid to the student, and he should always
search closely for evidences of their presence and character.

[Illustration: VI. WINTER TWIG OF RED MULBERRY

a. Tip-scar. b. Lateral bud. c. Leaf-scar. d. Stipule-scars.]

WINTER-BUDS.--Buds, with their accompanying leaf-and stipule-scars form
the basis of tree identification in winter. The size, color, position
with reference to the twig, number and arrangement and character of
bud-scales, etc., are all characters of the greatest value in winter
determinations. Buds are either terminal or lateral, depending on their
position on the twig. A lateral bud is one situated on the side of a
twig in the axil of a leaf-scar. A terminal bud is one situated at the
end of a twig, where it is ready to continue the growth of the twig the
following spring. In the keys an important consideration is the presence
or absence of the terminal bud. Inasmuch as the determination of this
point gives the beginner some trouble at first, it is hoped that the
accompanying diagrams and explanatory remarks will make the distinction
clear.

[Illustration: VII. WINTER TWIG OF BLACK WALNUT

   a. Terminal bud.
   b. Lateral bud.
   c. Leaf-scar.
   d. Bundle-scars.
   e. Pith.]

In the Elms, Willows, Basswood and many other species the terminal bud
and a small portion of the tip of the twig dies and drops off in late
autumn, leaving a small scar at the end of the twig (a, fig. VI). The
presence of this tip-scar indicates that the terminal bud is absent.
Often a lateral bud will be found very close to the tip-scar (b, fig.
VI), which, bending into line with the twig, makes it appear terminal.
However, the presence of a leaf-scar immediately below it shows it to be
a lateral bud (c, fig. VI). In some large twigs the eye unaided will
serve to find the tip-scar, but with the smaller twigs a hand-lens is
necessary.

The arrangement, size and shape of the leaf-scars (c, fig. VII) are
important factors in identification by winter characters. Within the
leaf-scars are one or more dots (d, fig. VII), sometimes quite
inconspicuous, often very prominent. These are the scars left by the
fibro-vascular bundles which run through the petiole into the blade of
the leaf, and are designated as bundle-scars. There may be only one as
in Sassafras and Hackberry, two as in Ginkgo, three as in the Poplars
and Cherries, or many; and they may be arranged in a U- or V-shaped line,
or they may be without definite order. Often stipule-scars (d, fig. VI)
occur on either side of the leaf-scar; these are scars left by the fall
of a pair of small leaflets called stipules and located at the base of
the leaves, and their form varies according to the form of the stipules
which made them.

BARK.--The woodsman uses the bark of a tree more than any other character
in distinguishing the trees about him, and he is often able to use this
character alone with much accuracy at great distances. However, the
appearance of bark differs so greatly with the age of the tree and with
its environment that it is difficult to describe it accurately. Some
characters are distinctive, however, and serve as a ready means of
identification; such characters are the peeling of the Sycamore and
Paper Birch, the "shagging" of the Shagbark Hickory, the spicy taste of
Sassafras bark and the mucilaginous inner bark of the Slippery Elm.

WOOD.--It is not expected that the information given under this heading
will be of any particular value in identifying living trees. Often,
however, the student finds himself in the midst of felling operations,
when the information concerning the wood is of considerable value.

DISTRIBUTION AND HABITAT.--To a lesser extent do distribution and habitat
of a species aid in the identification of a tree. It is a distinct aid
to know that the Chestnut is native in south-eastern Michigan only and
that the Mountain Ash does not extend south of Ludington. So too,
knowing the water-loving habit of the Swamp White Oak, we would not
expect to find this same tree flourishing on the top of a hard, dry
hill.

The characters, then, which are used to identify the trees about us are
many. Not all will be available at any one time, not all have been
mentioned in the foregoing pages nor in the manual. It is our opinion,
however, that the student will not be greatly handicapped by this lack
of detail, but rather that he will take great interest and genuine
pleasure in discovering these things for himself.


ARTIFICIAL KEYS, HOW MADE AND USED

An artificial key is a scheme for easily and quickly identifying any
unknown object under consideration. This bulletin being devoted to the
trees of Michigan, the keys to be found herein are intended to make it
possible for any person, even if his botanical training be meager, to
determine what trees grow about any home or farm, city park or woodlot
in the state. With certain modifications and limitations they may prove
useful in other localities as well. Since many people are unfamiliar
with the construction and use of keys for identification, it will be the
purpose of the following paragraphs to briefly outline the principles of
construction and the manner of using the keys to be found here.

The keys are based on the most striking similarities and differences
which the various parts of trees--twigs, buds, leaves, etc.--show, i. e.,
those characters which stand out in bold relief, which catch the eye at
first sight. Two alternatives are presented, either a character _is_ or
_is not_ present; these are the only choices possible. Indeed, further
divisions are unnecessary and only lead to confusion and possible
oversight. The two diametrically opposed characters are said to be
coordinate in rank. In the keys they are preceded by the same letter or
letters (_a_ and _aa_ or _b_ and _bb,_ etc.) and are set at the same
distance from the left margin of the page. Often _a_ and _aa,_ or _b_
and _bb_ are further divisible into other groups; in every case the
characters are opposed (a positive and a negative) and are given
coordinate rank. It is desirable for mechanical reasons to divide the
main divisions of the key more or less evenly, but this is not always
feasible, nor should it be religiously adhered to.

Suppose as a concrete example that it is desired to construct a key to
distinguish five houses in a city block. Three of these are of wood
construction, two are of brick, and of the two wooden houses one is
painted white and one brown. We may classify them as follows:

   a. Houses wood.

   b. Body paint brown. _Smith's house_
   bb. Body paint white.

   c. Trimmings green color. _Jones' house_
   cc. Trimmings slate color. _Brown's house_

   aa. Houses brick.

   b. Roof gray slate. _Johnson's house_
   bb. Roof red tile. _Public Library_

It is desirable in many cases to add other characters to lessen the
liability of confusion, where the characters chosen are not distinct,
and to show the user that he is on the right track. Thus, in the example
just given, green color and slate color under certain defects of the
eye, a coating of dust or deficiencies of the light might be confused,
under which circumstances we would be justified in adding to the above
statements without the criticism of description being made. Thus:

   bb.
   c. Trimmings green color; gable roof. _Jones' house_
   cc. Trimmings slate color; mansard roof. _Brown's house_

The keys in this bulletin are constructed on the above principles. They
are not in all cases as simple as the illustration just used, but if the
reader has mastered the house illustration he will have little or no
trouble with the larger keys. Suppose that (during a summer stroll) you
come across a large tree with rough, hard bark and thin, lobed leaves
which you do not know. Turning to the _Summer Key to the Genera_ you
find first _a. Leaves simple_, and contrasted with this _aa. Leaves
compound._ Obviously the leaf is simple and the genus sought lies in
that portion of the key preceding _aa_, i.e., under _a._ _b_ and _bb_
under _a_ give you a choice between _Leaves needle-shaped_,
_awl-shaped_, _strap-shaped_ or _scale-like_ and _Leaves broad and
flat_. The leaf being broad and flat you pass to _c_ and _cc_ under
_bb_. Here you have a choice between _Leaves alternate or clustered_ and
_Leaves opposite or whorled_. Inspection shows the arrangement to be
opposite, and you know that the genus sought lies in that portion of the
key between _cc_ and _aa_. Passing to _d_ and _dd_ under _cc_ gives the
choice between _Margin of leaves entire or only slightly undulate_ and
_Margin of leaves serrate to lobed_. The leaf is deeply lobed. It is
then either a _Viburnum_ or an _Acer_, and the fact that the leaf-margin
is lobed and not finely serrate brings the chase down to _Acer_. Before
going further go back over the key and make careful note of the
particular characters which were used to separate this genus from the
other genera and try to fix these in mind. This done, turn to the page
indicated, where you will find a _Summer Key to the Species of Acer_.
You run through this key in the same manner that you did the genus key.
If you have been careful in your search you will finally stop at _Acer
saccharum_. Once more pause and go back over this key and try to fix in
mind the characters which were used to separate the various species,
especially the difference between your tree and _Acer platanoides_,
which it so closely resembles. This done, turn to the page indicated and
compare the characters of your tree with the drawings and descriptions.
If you are satisfied with your diagnosis, well and good. If you find
that you are wrong, go over the keys again and find wherein you were led
astray.

Before you leave the tree take a sample of leaf properly labeled which
you can press between the pages of an old magazine and save for future
reference. Do this with other trees which you may find and when you get
home lay them out side by side so that the labels will not show and
compare them. A few trials of this kind will serve to form a mental
picture of each leaf which you will remember.

A very helpful practice for the beginner is that of making keys based
upon various characters. Practice keys of this kind will bring out the
differences and likenesses of trees as will no other means, and
characters which have hitherto escaped the eye will be prominently
brought forward. Nor should the student take his characters from books,
but rather should he go to the woods and get his knowledge first hand.

It is hardly necessary to state that the key is a valuable crutch while
learning to walk, but once the leg is strong enough to bear the weight
it should be discarded, lest it become a burden. A key has for its main
object the guidance of the student through the preliminary steps leading
to a more intimate knowledge of the trees. When once he knows a tree,
instinctively, because of long acquaintance with it, just as he knows
people, then the need for a key will have ceased.

+GINKGOACEAE+

+Ginkgo.[C] Maidenhair Tree+

_Ginkgo biloba L._ [_Salisburia adiantifolia Smith_]


HABIT.--A slender tree in youth, with slender, upright branches, becoming
broader with age and forming a symmetrical, pyramidal crown; probably
60-80 feet high, with a trunk diameter of 2-4 feet.

LEAVES.--Clustered at the ends of short, spur-like shoots, or scattered
alternately on the long terminal branches; simple; 2-5 inches broad;
more or less fan-shaped; usually bilobed and irregularly crenate at the
upper extremity; thin and leathery; glabrous, pale yellow-green on both
sides; petioles long, slender; turning a clear, golden yellow before
falling in autumn.

FLOWERS.--May, with the leaves; dioecious; the staminate in
short-stalked, pendulous catkins, 1 to 1-1/2 inches long, yellow; the
pistillate more or less erect on the shoot, long-stalked, consisting of
2 naked ovules, one of which usually aborts.

FRUIT.--Autumn; a more or less globose drupe, orange-yellow to green,
about 1 inch in diameter, consisting of an acrid, foul-smelling pulp
inclosing a smooth, whitish, somewhat flattened, almond-flavored nut.

WINTER-BUDS.--Terminal bud about 1/8 inch long, conical, smooth, light
chestnut-brown; lateral buds divergent, usually only on rapid-growing
shoots.

BARK.--Twigs gray-brown and smooth; thick, ash-gray and somewhat
roughened on the trunk, becoming more or less fissured in old age.

WOOD.--Light, soft, weak, close-grained, yellow-white to light red-brown,
with thin, lighter colored sapwood.

NOTES.--Origin in dispute, but probably a native of northern China.
Extensively cultivated in China and Japan, where its fruit is esteemed.
Easily propagated from seed. Thrives in deep, well-drained, rich soil.
Practically free from insect and fungous attacks, and little harmed by
the smoke of cities. Probably hardy throughout the southern half of the
Lower Peninsula.

+WINTER KEY TO THE SPECIES OF SALIX+

The classification of the Willows is a task for the specialist, even
when leaves and both staminate and pistillate flowers are obtainable. It
is impractible for the novice to attempt the determination of species of
Salix with winter characters alone. Consequently the usual winter key is
omitted.

_Salix (Tourn.) L._


The genus _Salix_ is represented in Michigan by thirty or more distinct
species, and there are many more hybrids. The majority of these are
shrubs, only a few becoming truly arborescent. Because of the similarity
of their botanical characters, the frequency with which they hybridize,
and the facility with which they respond to their environment only an
expert is competent to identify the species so abundant along our water
courses and on the banks of our lakes and swamps. The scope of this work
being necessarily limited, it has been deemed best to describe but two
of our native willows and two of our foreign neighbors which are
frequently planted.

+The Haws, Thorns, Hawthorns or Thorn-apples+

_Crataegus L._


Owing to the complexity of the various forms in this group, the present
state of uncertainty as to the value of certain characters, and the
questionable validity of many of the assigned names, it is thought to be
beyond the scope of this bulletin to give more than a general
description of the group as a whole, recommending the more ambitious
student to the various manuals and botanical journals and papers for
more detailed information.

The _Crataegi_ are generally low, wide-spreading trees or shrubs, with
strong, tortuous branches and more or less zigzag branchlets usually
armed with stiff, sharp thorns. The bark varies from dark red to gray
and is shallowly fissured or scaly. The leaves are alternate, simple,
generally serrate, often lobed, with short or long petioles. The flowers
appear in May or June, with or after the leaves, in simple or compound
corymbs, whitish or pinkish, perfect. The fruit is a red to yellow,
sometimes blue or black pome, subglobose to pear-shaped, with usually
dry and mealy flesh and 1-5 seeds. The winter-buds are small, nearly
globose, lustrous brown. _Crataegus_ produces wood which is heavy, hard,
tough, close-grained, red-brown, with thick, pale sapwood. The Haws are
trees of the pasture-lands, the roadside, the open woods and the
stream-banks, and are more common in the southern than in the northern
portions of the state. Some of the species are desirable as ornaments in
parks and gardens on account of their beautiful and abundant flowers and
showy fruits.

_Fraxinus pennsylvanica lanceolata (Borkh.) Sarg._ [_Fraxinus lanceolata
Borkh._] [_Fraxinus viridis Michx. f._]


Considered by some authors to be a distinct species, and by others a
variety of _F. pennsylvanica Marsh._, which it resembles. The main
points of difference are:

   The usual absence of pubescence from the branchlets,
   the underside of the leaflets, and the petioles.

   The rather narrower, shorter, and more sharply
   serrate leaflets.

   The color of the leaves, which is bright green on both
   sides.

A very hardy tree, of rapid growth and desirable habit, making it useful
for ornamental and street planting. Easily transplanted.

Of rare occurrence in Michigan, but has been reported from several
localities.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
