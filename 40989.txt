Transcriber's note:

      The Gairdner edition of the Paston Letters was printed in six
      volumes. Each volume is a separate e-text; Volume VI is further
      divided into two e-texts, Letters and Index. Volume I, the
      General Introduction, will be released after all other volumes,
      matching the original publication order.

      Except for footnotes and sidenotes, all brackets are in the
      original, as are parenthetical question marks and (_sic_)
      notations. Series of dots representing damaged text are as in
      the printed original.

      The year was shown in a sidenote at the top of each page; this
      has been merged with the sidenote at the beginning of each
      Letter or Abstract.

      A carat character is used to denote superscription. The
      character(s) following the carat is superscripted (example:
      xxviii^me). Braces { } are used only when the superscripted
      text is immediately followed by non-superscripted letters
      or period (full stop). Errata and other transcriber's notes
      are shown in [[double brackets]]. The notation "corrected by
      editor" refers to the Errata printed in Volume VI. "(o)" is
      used to represent the male ordinal.

      Footnotes have their original numbering, with added page
      number to make them usable with the full Index. They are
      grouped at the end of each Letter or Abstract.

      Typographical errors are listed at the end of each Letter,
      after the footnotes. In the primary text, errors were only
      corrected if they are clearly editorial, such as missing
      italics, or mechanical, such as u-for-n misprints. Italic "d"
      misprinted as "a" was a recurring problem. The word "invisible"
      means that there is an appropriately sized blank space, but the
      letter or punctuation mark itself is missing. The spelling
      "Jhon" is not an error. Gresham and Tresham are different
      people.

      Note that the printed book used z to represent original small
      letter yogh. This has not been changed for the e-text.

THE PASTON LETTERS

_Early Documents_


Before entering upon the correspondence of the Paston family, in the
reign of Henry VI., we have thought it well to give the reader a brief
note of such deeds and charters of an earlier date as appear either to
have been preserved in the family, or to have any bearing on its
history. The following is a list of those we have been able to meet with
either in the originals or in other quarters, such as Blomefield's
_History of Norfolk_, where notices are given of several documents,
which appear now to have got into unknown hands. The documents seen by
Blomefield, and those from the Paston and Dawson-Turner collections, now
in the British Museum, were probably all at one time part of the Paston
family muniments. The three Harleian charters seem to have been derived
from a different source.

  A Deed is cited by Blomefield (_Hist. Norf._ vi. 480), by which
  Anselm, Abbot of St. Benet's, Hulme, and the Convent there, gave to
  Osbern, the priest (said by Blomefield to have been a son of Griffin
  de Thwait, the founder of the Paston family), the land of St.
  Benet's of Paston (_terram Sancti Benedicti de Paston_), in fee, for
  half the farm of one _caruca_, as his ancestors used to pay for the
  same.

  Also a Deed of William the Abbot (who lived in King Stephen's
  reign), granting to Richer de Pastun, son of Osbern, son of Griffin
  de Thwete, all the land that the Convent held in Pastun, with their
  men, and other pertinencies.

  Also a Deed of Covenant between Richer de Paston and Reginald the
  Abbot, and Convent of St. Benet's, Holme, that when peace should be
  settled in England, and pleas held in the Court of our Lord the
  King, the said Richer would, at the request and at the expense of
  the Abbot, give him every security in Court to release the lands in
  Pastun.

  'Ralph de Paston was son, as I take it' (says Blomefield) 'of this
  Richer, and appears to have had two sons, Richard and Nicholas.

  'Richard, son of Ralph de Paston, by his deed, _sans_ date, granted
  to Geoffrey, son of Roger de Tweyt, lands in this town (Oxnead),
  paying 9d. per ann. for his homage and service, 40s. for a fine
  (_in gersumam_), and paying to him and his heirs on the feasts of
  St. Andrew, Candlemas, Pentecost, and St. Michael, on each feast,
  2s. _ob._ He sealed with one _lis_. Laurence de Reppes, William and
  John, his brother, William de Bradfield, &c., were witnesses.'
  --Blomefield, vi. 480-1.

  'There was also another branch of this family, of which was Wystan,
  or Wolstan, de Paston, which I take to be the lineal ancestor of Sir
  William Paston, the Judge, and the Earls of Yarmouth. This Wolstan
  lived in the reign of Henry II. and Richard I., and married, as is
  probable, a daughter of the Glanvilles, as appeared from an
  impalement of Paston and Glanville in the windows of Paston Hall in
  Paston. His son and heir styled himself Robert de Wyston and Robert
  de Paston; who, dying in or about 1242, was buried at Bromholm, and
  left Edmund de Paston. To this Edmund, son of Robert, son of Wolstan
  de Paston, Sir Richard de Paston gave the land in Paston which
  Robert, his father, held of him and Nicholas, his brother, by deed
  _sans_ date.' --Blomefield, vi. 481.

  Undated Deed of Nicholaus filius Radulfi Diaconi de Paston, granting
  to Robert, son of Wistan de Paston, two parcels of land--one of them
  abutting on the lands of Eudo de Paston. Witnesses--Richard de
  Trunch; Will. Esprygy; Ralph de Reppes; Roger de Reppes; Richard,
  s. of Ralph de Baketon; John de Reppes; Roger, s. of Warin de Paston;
  Hugh, s. of Will. de Paston, &c.--Add. Charter 17,217, B.M. (Paston
  MSS.).

  Edmund, son of Robert Wistan de Pastune, lands in Pastune,
  &c.--(_Seal attached, in fine condition._)--Add. Charter 17,218,
  B.M. (Paston MSS.).

  Blomefield also mentions (vi. 481) that Nicholas, son of Ralph de
  Paston, gave lands to Robert, son of Wystan de Paston, by deed _sans
  date_. Witness, Roger de Repps.

  Undated Deed Poll, by which Richard, the son of Ralph, Deacon of
  Paston, grants to Edmund, the son of Robert Wiston of Paston,
  certain lands at Paston.--Add. Charter 14,810, B.M. (D. Turner's
  Collection of Deeds relating to Norfolk).

  Richard, son of Ralph de Paston, according to Blomefield (xi. 24),

  gift is also mentioned by Richard Taylor in his Index Monasticus of
  the Diocese of Norwich, p. 15, where the purpose of the endowment is
  said to be 'to keep their books in repair.'

  Deed, cited by Blomefield (vi. 481), by Richard, son of John, son of
  Richard de Paston, granting to Richer Alunday and his heirs his
  native Alan de Tilney, with all his family, &c. (_cum tota
  sequela_), and 7 acres of land in Paston and Knapton, with
  messuages, &c., for 4 marks of silver _in gersumam_, and a rent of
  22_d._ a year.

INFORMATION AGAINST WALTER ASLAK[12.1]

[Sidenote: 1424]

Be it remembred that where, on the nyght next biforne the feste of the
Circumcision of owre Lord Jesu, the [second][12.2] yeer of the regne of
Kyng Henry the Sexte, certeyns maffaisours, felons, and brekeres of the
kynges peas vnknowyn, to the noumbre of iiij^xx [_four score_] and more
by estimacion, of malice and imaginacion forne thowght felonowsly, the
dwellyng place of John Grys of Wyghton, in Wyghton, in the shyre of
Norffolk, brokyn, and with carpenteres axes the yates and the dores of
the seyd place hewen, and the seyd John Grys, and hys sone, and a
servaunt man of hese by here bodyes tokyn, and fro the seyd dwellyng
place by the space of a myle to a payre gawles ledden, there hem for to
have hangyd; and by cause hem fayled ropes convenient to here felonowse
purpos, the seyd John Grys, hese sone, and hys man there felonowsely
slowen and mordered in the most orrible wyse that ever was herd spoken
of in that cuntre. Wher up on Walter Aslak, purposyng and imaginyng to
putte William Paston in drede and intollerable fere to be slayn and
mordered in the seyd forme with force and ageyn the kinges peas, on the
shyre day of Norffolk, halden at Norwiche, the xxviij day of August, in
the seyd secunde yeer, beyng there thanne a grete congregacion of poeple
by cause of the seyd shyre, in hese owne persone, and by Richard
Kyllynworth, that tyme hese servaunt, to the seyd William Paston swiche
and so many manaces of deth and dismembryng maden and puttyn by certeyns
Englische billes rymed in partye, and up on the yates of the Priorie of
the Trinite chirche of Norwiche, and on the yates of the chyrche of the
Freres Menures of Norwiche, and the yates of the same Cite called
Nedeham yates and Westewyk yates, and in othre places wyth inne the seyd
Cite by the seyd Walter and Richard sette, makyng mension and berying
this undyrstondyng that the seyd William, and hese clerkes, and
servauntes schuld be slayn and mordered in lyke forme as the seyd John
Grys in the seyd forme was slayne and mordered: conteyning also these
too words in Latyn, _et cetera_, by which wordes communely it was
undyrstandyn that the forgeers and makers of the seyd billes imagyned to
the seyd William, hese clerkes and servauntes, more malice and harm than
in the seyd billes was expressed. Wherfore the seyd William, hese seyd
clerkes and servauntz, by longe tyme aftyr were in gret and intolerable
drede and fere by the sayd maffaisours and felons to be slayn and
mordered. Wherfore the seyd William, hese clerkes and servauntes, ne
durst not at here fredom nothyr goon ne ryde.

Wher up on the seyd William, for hese owyn persone, affermyd a pleynt of
trespas ageyn the seyd Walter and Richard, processe contynued ther up on
til the seyd Walter and Richard were founden gilty of the seyd trespas
by an iniquisicion ther of takyn in dwe and lawefull forme, by whiche
inquisicion the damages of the seyd William for the seyd trespas were
taxed to cxx^li [L120]. Aftyr which pleynte affermyd, and to fore ony
plee up on the seyd pleynt pleded, the seyd Walter and William, by
Thomas Erpyngham, Knyght, a myghty and a gret supportour of the seyd
Walter in alle these matiers and circumstaunces ther of ageyn the seyd
William, were induced to trete in the same matier in the forme that
folwith: That is to seyne, that the seyd William schuld sue forth the
seyd pleynt and the execucion ther of at hese owne will, and the seyd
Walter schuld defende hym self in the seyd pleynt at hese owne will,
except that he schuld no benefice take by noon proteccion, ne wrytte of
_corpus cum causa_, ne of no lordes lettres up on the seyd sute. And
what so ever fortunyd in the seyd pleynt, the proces, execucion, or the
sute ther of, the seyd Walter and William schuld stonde and obeye to the
ordinaunce of certeyns persones by the seyd William and Walter
arbitratores that tyme named, if thei myghten accordyn, and ellys of
anoonpier also that same tyme named, of alle the seyd trespas, pleynt,
and sute, and alle the circumstaunces ther of, so that the seyd
arbitrement and ordinaunce of the seyd arbitratores, or ellys of the
seyd nounpier, were made withinne xl. dayes next folwyng aftyr the
jugement geven in the seyd pleynt.

And aftyrward, the Thursday next biforn Pentecost, the thrydde yeer of
the regne of the seyd kyng, at London, in the presence of the right
excellent, high and myghty prynce, the Duc de Gloucestre,[14.1] and by
hese commaundement, atte sute and instaunce of the seyd Thomas
Erpyngham, it was accordyd bytwen the seyd William and Walter that thei
schuld stande and obeye to the ordinaunce and award of alle the seyed
matiers of twenye of these iiij. persones, William Phelip, Knyght, Henry
Inglose, Knyght, Oliver Groos, and Thomas Derham, chosen on the partye
of the seyd William Paston, and tweyne of those iiij. persones, Symond
Felbrygge, Knyght, Bryan Stapilton, Knyght, Roberd Clyfton, Knyght, and
John of Berneye of Redeham, chosen on the partie of the seyd Water, and
elles the decree and jugement of a nounpier to be chosen by the same
arbitrores. The whiche William Phelip, Bryan Stapilton, Roberd Clyfton,
Oliver Groos, John of Berneye, and Thomas Derham, takyng up on hem the
charge of the makyng of the seyd award and ordinaunce by the assent of
the seyd Thomas Erpyngham, the Fryday next aftyr the feste of the
Assumpcion of Owre Lady, in the seyd thrydde yeer, at Norwiche, tokyn
ensurans of the seyd William and Walter by here fayth and here trowthez
to stande and obeye to here ordinaunce of alle the seyd matiers, and the
same day biforne noon, maden here full ordinaunce and arbitrement of
alle the same matiers in the chyrche of the Greye Freyrys at Norwich;
and aftyrward, up on the same award and ordinaunce mad, hadden a
communicacion ther of with the seyd Thomas Erpyngham; and aftyr the same
communicacion, the same day aftyr noon, the same ordinaunce and award
wretyn was red byforn the seyd arbitrores and the seyd Walter and
William, and examyned, agreed, and assented, and by the seales of the
same vj. arbitrores and the seyd Walter and William, was affermed and
ensealed and left in the handes of the seyd Sir Bryan, saveliche to be
kept in playne remembraunce of the seyd award and ordinaunce; the whiche
award and ordinaunce the seyd William was at all tymes redy to obeye and
performe, on to the seyd feste of Michelmesse, that the seyd Walter to
holde or performe the seyd award pleynly refused.

And where the seyd Walter, by jugement of the Chaunceller of Inglond,
the xvj. day of Jull' the seyd thrydde yeer, was remytted to the kynges
prison at Norwich by cause of the seyd sute, the seyd Walter yede at
large owt of warde fro the seyd xvj. day of Jull' to the seyd day of the
makyng of the seyd arbitrement and award, and fro that day in to
Michelmesse thanne next aftyr; the seyd William that meene tyme evermore
supposyng that the seyd Walter wolde have holde and performyd the sayd
ordinaunce, arbitrement, and award. And at the comyng of the right high
and myghty prynce the Duc of Norfolk fro his Castell of Framyngham to
the Cetie of Norwyche, aftyr the seyd day of the makyng of this
arbitrement and ordinaunce, and to fore the feste of Michelmesse than
next folwyng, the seyd Walter by hese sotill and ungoodly enformacion
caused the seyd Duke to be hevy lord to the seyd William. Where the seyd
William the tyme of the seyd enformacion was with Sir John Jermy,
Knyght, and othre of the counseill of the seyd Duk of Norffolk in hys
lordshipes in Norffolk and Suffolk, thanne to hym falle [_fallen_] by
the deth of the right worthy and noble lady hys modyr, occupied abowte
the dwe service of wryttes of _diem clausit extremum_[16.1] aftyr the
deth of the seyd lady. And where as the seyd William Paston, by
assignement and commaundement of the seyd Duk of Norffolk, at hese fyrst
passage over the see in to Normandye, in the kynges tyme Henry the
Fyfte, was the Styward of the seyd Duc of Norffolk, of alle hese
lordshipes in Norffolk and Suffolk fro hys seyd passage un to the seyd
feste of Michelmesse; [And[16.2] over that as sergeaunt of lawe, thow he
be unworthy, withholdyn with the seyd Duc of Norffolk alle the tyme that
he was sergeaunt bifore the same feste of Michelmesse. And all be it
that the fees and the wages of the seyd William for hys seyd service
unpayed draweth a gret some to hys pouere degree, if the seyd Duk of
Norffolk lyked, of hys noble and plentifous grace, to graunte to the
seyd William, in right, ony part of the favour of hese good lordship,
the seyd William wolde evere be hys pouere and trewe bedeman, and evere
in hys herte thenke alle hys seyd service, and alle the service that
ever he dede to the seyd [Duke] of Norfolk, plentefeousely weell
rewarded.[16.3]]

And where the seyd Walter, the tyme of the seyd trespas and of the seyd
bylles makyng ne long to fore, ne never aftyr biforn the seyd comyng of
the seyd Duc of Norffolk to Norwich, ne no tyme hangyng the seyd sute,
ne the tyme of makyng of the said arbitrement and ordinaunce, never was
servaunt to the seyd Duc of Norffolk at fees, ne at wages, ne wythhaldyn
in hese service, ne to hym sued to be supported by hese high Lordship in
this seyd matier, to the knowleche of the seyd William, ne to no commune
knowleche, in the shyres of Norffolk, Suffolk, ne Norwiche; the sute
that the seyd Walter made for supportacion in this seyd matier was be
the meene of the seyd Thomas Erpyngham to the seyd Duk of Gloucestre, by
whose reule and commaundemente the seyd arbitrement and award was mad in
the forme aforn seyd. And not with stondying the seyd trespas and
grevaunce by the seyd Walter doon the seyd William, ne that the seyd
William ne is not satisfied of the seyd cxx^li., ne no peny therof,
and hath absteyned hym of al maner of execucion, sewyng of godes or
catelles, that by force of the seyd processe, or ony othyr, he myght
have had ageyn the seyd Walter or hese borwes [_sureties_], ne that the
seyd William hath suffred the seyd Walter to gon at large by long tyme
whan he myght have had hys body in warde in lawfull forme: The seyd
Walter, be billes in the too last parlementz holden at Westminster and
at Leycestre, and at divers tymes in divers other maneres hath noysed
and skaundered the seyd William ungoodly and othyr wyse than othyr
[_either_] gentilnesse or trowthe wolde; and, overmore, caused the seyd
William orribly to be manassed of hys deth, betyng and dismembryng of
hys persone by certeyns servauntz of the Lordes Fitz Wauter and othre
persones, and by ferefull and overe felle lettres and sondes. Wherfore
the seyd William, nothyr hese frendes, ne hese servauntz in hys
companye, at here fredam sithen the seyd parlement at Leycestre durst
not, ne yet ne dar not rydyn ne goo abowte swyche occupacion as he arn
used and disposed, to here grete and unportable drede and vexacion in
here spirites, and gret harme and damage and losse of here pouere
goodes.

[Overmore,[17.1] the seyd Walter hath sued, and yet rigorously suethe a
wrytte of _decies tantum_[17.2] ageyns x. persones of the seyd
Inquisicion and ij. of the servauntz of the seyd William and iiij. othre
persones; supposyng by hese seyd sute hem to have taken of the seyd
William in hys seyd syte lxij^li [L62] and more of moneye. The whiche
sute of _decies tantum_ the seyd Walter, betwyx God and hym, knewith
verraly is untrewe. And also the seyd Walter hath sued, and yet persuyth
Adam Aubre, on of the seyd Inquisicion in the court of the said Duc of
Norffolk of hys manoir of Fornsete, by cause and occasion of the seyd
matiers, in whiche sute in the seyd court it is proceded ageyn the seyd
Adam in other maner thanne othyr lawe, conscience, or good fayth
wolde.[18.1]]

Overmore the seyd William, atte commaundement of the seyd Duc of
Norffolk, hath submytted hym to stonde to the ordinaunce of divers
persones of alle the seyd matiers: ones at Leyceetre, the Wednesday next
biforn Palm Soneday, the iiij. yeer of the regne of the syd kyng;
anothyr tyme at Reed clyf in Aprill the same iiij. yeer, aftyr the forme
of certeyns billes endented ther of made. The whiche submission, with
alle the circumstaunces ther of, the seyd William hath be at alle tymes
redy to obeye. The cause why the seyd Walter, by the seyd Englishe
bylles, and in othyr forme, putte and sette the seyd William, and hys
seyd clerkes and servauntz, in drede and fere intollerable to be slayn
and mordered, and to hem trespaced in the forme aforn seyd, was onely
for as moche as the seyd William was with the prior of Norwiche of
counseille in hese trewe defence ageyn the entent of the seyd Walter in
a sute that he made ageyn the seyd priour of a voweson of the chyrche of
Sprouston in the counte of Norffolk, wher to the seyd Walter hath nothyr
title suffisaunt ne right in no maner wyse by ony matier by hym declared
byforn thys tyme.

This scrowe is mad only for the informacion of the worthy and
worshipfull lordes the arbitrores; savyng evere to the maker the
benefice reasonably to adde and amenuse, his ignoraunce in swiche
occupation and defaute of leyser also tendrely considered.

to be my cousyn. [I have many pouere men of my kyn, but so fals, and so
pouere,--but he was nevere of my kyn.][22.1] God defende that any of my

Ixworthe told me that he hadde lettres fro a frende of yowres in the
courtt of Rome, that is of the seyd prioures counseill in this mater as
ye be, whos name I knowe nought, specifyeng that the seyd John Wortes
adversarius prioris desperat in causa et concordiam quaerit. It is told
me sithen that the seyd John Wortes is in the cite of Rome, sacred a
bysshop of Irland, videlicet episcopus Corcagensis, wherby it is seyd
here that his pretense of his title to the priourie of Bromholme is
adnulled, and voide in your lawe. The seyd John Wortes, and a contreman
of myne in the seyd court, Maister John Urry, have sent me lettres,
wherof I sende yow copies and a trewe instruccion of the seyd matier
closed with this bille, the whiche lettres and the matier ther of me
semyth mervaillous and straunge. A prest of Norffolk, that spak with yow
in Julie or August last passed, told me that he yede with yow to the
cardinales hous, Trikaricensis,[22.2] to espie if any swyche processe
were sued ageyn me as the seyd lettres specifien, and that ye told the
same prest at alle tymes ther was than no swiche processe sued, ne had;
the whiche relacion I trust and beleve bettre than the seyd lettres.
I have, by advys of counseill, in makyng a procuracie _ad agendum,
defendendum, provocandum, et appellandum_ to yow and the seyd Maister
John Urry and the Wynsalaw (?) de Swysto; and also a general appelle,

the whiche procuracie and appelle I shal sende to yowr persone,
tantummodo [cum pecuniis],[22.3] with moneye onward, on trust. My will
is, ye have the chief governaunce of this matier, and that this article
be counseille [_i.e._, secret]; wher upon I prey yow hertily to be
saddely avysed in these matiers, and, as nede is, so to governe hem by

somouned, ne never hadde tydynges of this matier but by seyd lettres and

[Sidenote: Ista litera missa non fuit.]

Right worthy and worshepefull Sir, I recomaunde to yow, preyeng yow to
wite that I have resceyved yowr goodly lettres makyng mencion that Sir
John Paston,[23.3] ut asserit, hath optyned me condempnyd to hym in
CCC[vij.][23.4] marcz and C._s._; and that the same John, atte
reverence of your right worthy persone, hathe cesed of his sute of
certeins processes ageyns me up on the seyd condempnacion, takyng
continuance[23.5] of the same matier unto Cristemasse next comyng; by
which lettres ye conseille me to make ende with the seyd John, ne
deterius inde contingat. I [s]end yow, closed with this bille,
[the][23.6] copie of un frendly lettre that the seyd John hathe sent to
me late, touchant the same matier. The seyd priour hath sent also to
yow, and to Mayster William Swan, whiche longe hathe be his procurator,
a procuracie for my person, and v. marcz of moneye onward. Wher up, in
the seyd prioures name, and in myn own also, I prey yow hertily to sette
al these matieres in continuaunce un to yowr comyng in to Ingeland; and
because ye arn here beneficed, owr cuntreman, and of worshepe and
cunnyng worthyly endowed, the seyd priour and his brether, and I also,
willen gladdely in these matieres be treted by yow; and if this mesure
be accepted, and we may have knowyng here ther of, it shall cause the
attemptacion of diverses matieres a geyn summe frendes of the seyd John
to cese. And if this continuance be refused, I prey yow, with al my
power, that of your wysdom and good discrecion ye wille, in the seyd
prioures name, and myn, defenden the seyd sutes, and alle other that the
seyd Johne sueth ageyn the seyd priour and me, in your best maner, and
to be of owr counseill in these matieres; and as ye lyke resonablely to
write to us, so we wil be governed in yowre rewarde, and al other
circumstaunces of the same matieres.[24.1] I conceyve by your seyd
lettres that the grece of the matier conteigned in the same ye have of
the informacion and assercion of the seyd John, and as he hath enformed
yow, I wot weel ye trewely writen; but I hope and trust verrayly the
matier of his informacion is untrewe [for he hathe no cause to swe to
me, ne I was nevre somouned ne cited].[24.2] The priour of Bromholm sued
ageyn the seyd John and other in Ingeland a wryt of _praemunire facias_,
and I was therin of the same prioures counseill as the lawe of Ingelond
and myn office willen, and more I have nought hadde to do with the seyd
Johne, and I can nought beleve that in this cas the same Johne myght by
your lawe any swich sute have ageyn me as your lettre specifieth. Also
William, the prest specified in yowr [letter],[24.3] told me that he,
after that ye told hym of this matier, lyke as yewrce (?), he comuned
with Maister William Swan, and he told the seyd prest ther no processe

  The above two documents are from a corrected draft, written on one
  side of a broad sheet of paper. On the other side is a long Latin
  pleading, also much corrected, relative to the Abbey of Bermondsey;
  prefixed to which are the following words, in the same hand as the
  preceding letters:--

  'Sir, do writen ij. copies of this note in papier, wyde writen, and
  gete a copie of the writte in the Eschekyr ageyn.'

  The pleading referred to is in a different hand, and begins as
  follows:--

  'Et praedictus abbas dicit quod ipse de praemissis domino Regi
  compotum reddere non debet; quia dicit quod diu ante erectionem,
  fundationem sive erectionem prioratus de Bermundeseye qui nunc
  erectus est in praedictam Abbatiam, Willielmus Rufus filius Willelmi
  Conquestoris nuper Rex Angliae fuit seisitus de manerio de
  Bermundeseye,' etc.

    [Footnote 21.2: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] This letter, being
    dated in November, was probably written before Nos. 11 and 12
    which follow, though evidently very near them in point of date.
    The chief evidence of the time when they all must have been
    written will be seen in No. 12.]

    [Footnote 21.3: Who this Prior was we cannot say, the list of
    the Priors of Bromholm being very defective. Blomefield says,
    that a Prior John has been met with in the 11th of Edward III.,
    and Robert, in the 14th of Henry VI.--that is to say, in 1435 or
    1436, just ninety-nine years later. Nothing is known of the
    Priors between these dates, even by the latest editors of
    Dugdale.]

    [Footnote 21.4: 'Commoigne,' i.e. brother monk. The writer also
    calls him _apostata_, _i.e._ a monk who has run away and
    renounced his order.]

    [Footnote 22.1: These words occur in the draft, but are crossed
    out.]

    [Footnote 22.2: Thomas Brancaccio, Cardinal Bishop of Tricarico.
    He was made a cardinal by his uncle, Pope John XXIII., and is
    said to have been a man of very bad morals.]

    [Footnote 22.3: Interlined, and afterwards erased.]

    [Footnote 23.1: Above these words, and in the place where the
    signature might have been expected, occur these names, one above
    another--
      'Thomas Abbas de Leyston, in Com' Suff.
      'Ricardus Fremelyngham, concanonichus ibidem.'
    They do not, however, appear to be connected with the letter.
    The following words are also scrawled between this letter and
    the next:-- 'N. persona ecclesiae de Testerton in Com' Norff.
    Gees Cuttyng. Joh' persona ecclesiae de Yermuth (?), Alicia
    Gosloth (?).']

    prefixed to a priest's name.]

    here spoken of as a Serjeant, attained that degree in 1421, and
    was made Judge of the Common Pleas in 1429. But a closer
    approximation to the date of this letter may be made by
    comparing it with that which follows, which is certainly much
    about the same time.]

    [Footnote 26.1: William Paston, as appears by Nos. 12 and 14
    following, disputed this writer's right to call himself Paston,
    and asserted that his real name was Wortes. It is curious that

    Priors of Bromholm, is the name either of Paston or Wortes to be
    met with.]

[Sidenote: 1426 / MARCH 1]

Right worthy and worshepefull sires and maistres, I recomand me to yow,
and thank yow with al my herte, of the gret tendrenesse ye lyke to have
of the salvacion of my symple honeste, preying yow evermore of your good
continuance. I have, after the advys of your lettre, doon dewely
examyned the instrument by the wysest I coude fynde here, and in
especial by on Maister Robert Sutton,[27.1] a courtezane of the Court of
Rome, the which is the chief and most chier man with my Lord of
Gloucestre, and his matier in the said court for my lady, his
wyff;[27.2] and here aunswere is that al this processe, though it were
in dede preceded as the instrument specifieth, is not suffisant in the
lawe of Holy Cherche, and that hem semyth, by the sight of the
instrument and by the defautes [that] ye espied in the same and other,
and in maner by the knowelech of the notarie, that the processe, in gret
part ther of, is fal[se and un]trewe. I have taken advys of Maister
Robert Bruus, chauncellor with my Lord of Cantirbury,[27.3] and Maister
Nicholl Billesdon,[27.4] cha[uncellor] of my Lord of Wynchestre,[27.5]
and Maister John Blodwelle,[27.6] a weel lerned man holden, and a
suffisant courtezan of the seyd court, and all these acorden to the seyd
Maister Robert Sutton. Nought with stondyng that I herde nevere of this
matier no maner lykly ne credible evidence unto that I sey your lettre
and the instrument, yet I made an appell and a procuracie, and also a
provocacion, at London, longe biforn Cristemasse, by the a[dvys] of
Maister David Aprys, Maister Symond Kempston, and Maister James Cole,
and sent al this, with an instruccion of al the matier, w[ith] my
procuratours to Rome by your frere, my Maister Suppriour, and geff hym
gold that he was content: and, evermore, nowe here by advys I make this
day a newe appelle and a newe procuracion, and upon this alle the seyd
worthy men here seyn and informe me pleynly I have no maner cause in
lawe ne in conscience to drede aught in this matier. Myn
adversarie[27.7] is become Bysshop of Cork in Irland, and ther arn ij.
other persones provided to the same bysshopriche yet lyvyng, beforn my
seyd adversarie; and by this acceptacion of this bysshopriche, he hath
pryved hym self of the title that he claymed in Bromholm, and so
adnulled the ground of his processe ageyn me, and also the tyme of his
grevaunce pretendid, and the tyme of his sute he was _apostata_, and I
trowe is yet, and so unable to sue any swich processe. I purpose me to
come homward be London, to lerne more in this matier, if I may. I prey
the Holy Trinite, lord of your cherche and of alle the werld, delyvere
me of my iij. adversaries, of this cursed bysshop for Bromholm, Aslak
for Sprouston,[28.1] and Julian Herberd for Thornham. I have nought
trespassed ageyn noon of these iij., God knowing, and yet I am foule and
noysyngly vexed with hem, to my gret unease, and al for my lordes and
frendes matieres, and nought for myn owyn. I wot not whether it were
best in any sermon or other audience, in your cherche or elles where, to
declare aught of this matier in stoppyng of the noyse that renneth in
this case. I submitte me and alle this matier to your good discrecion;
and evere gremercy God, and ye, who ever have yow and me in His gracious
governance. I suppose to see yow on Palm Sunday. Writen at Leycestre,

'Dear and well-beloved Cousin.' --Is in good health, but ill at ease,
being informed that she is in debt to Steyard for my lord's debt, whose
soul God assoil, L7 and a pipe of wine. Knew nothing of it in my lord's
life, except of 2 pipes for herself, and one for her mother-in-law, of
which she has paid 20s. Since my Lord's death, Steyard has never asked
her for it. 'For which time, as I was at Jernemouth abiding in the Frere
Carmes the time of the pestilence, his wife came unto me,' asking the
writer to be good lady to him; and he asked no more then than the above
3 pipes. He asked no more last harvest when he was sick and like to die,
when John of Berneye was present. Thinks, therefore, his asking is
untrue. My Lord would have made me or some of his council privy to such
a debt. Hopes Paston, whom my Lord made one of his feoffees, will see
'that ye and I be discharged anemps the King as for the debt of
Steyard.' --Dated Castre, the day after the Conversion of St. Paul.
Addressed, 'A mon tres cher et bien ame cousin, Will'm Paston soit

  [This letter is endorsed in another hand, 'W. Paston, j. feoffatorum

  therefore, to have been written by the Lady Elizabeth, widow of Sir
  John Rothenhale, whose name occurs in No. 13 in connection with
  William Steyard of Great Yarmouth. She was the daughter of Sir
  Philip Branch, Kt., and had been previously married to John Clere of
  Ormesby. She died at Caister, the place from which this letter is
  dated, in 1440; and by her will, which was dated at Caister, 16th
  October 1438, she bequeathed all her goods at Ormesby to her son
  Robert Clere, and all her goods at Horning Hall, in Caister, to her
  son Edmund. --_See_ Blomefield's _Norfolk_, iv. 35, vi. 392, xi.

[Sidenote: 1426-7]

Depositions on the ---- day of ----, 5 Hen. VI., by Richard Wyoth,
executor of Margery, daughter and heir of Edmund Bakon, touching the
manor of Gressam which Bakon purchased, _temp._ Edw III. After the death
of two brothers, Margery became sole possessor, and gave it to Wyoth and
other executors to perform her will, with proviso that Philip Vache and
Eliz., his wife, should have it during their lives, but that the
reversion of it should be sold, giving William, son of Robert Moleyns,
the first option of purchase. It was accordingly offered to him, but he
refused to buy. On the death of said Eliz., however, he bought the manor
for 420 marks, and held it two years, when Wyoth re-entered because part
of the purchase-money was unpaid. W. Moleyns's wife, however, induced
him to accept security from Thos. Fawkoner, merchant of London, whose
daughter the said William agreed that his son should marry, when he came
of age; and it was arranged that meanwhile Fawkoner and Wyoth should be
jointly enfeoffed of the manor, which was to be given in jointure, if
the marriage took effect. The marriage did not take effect, and Fawkoner
re-entered upon the manor according to the enfeoffment, but paid Wyoth
nothing, till Thos. Chawsers,[31.1] Esq., a kinsman of the said Margery,
made him understand that Wyoth might enter on his own portion, and had
even a prior right to himself. At length Fawkoner sold his right to
Chaucers and Wyoth, and released the manor on security for the payment.
Wyoth then said he should have little advantage by the bargain, except
in having easy days of payment; 'et quod dictus Thomas Chaucers, pro
bona voluntate quod (_sic_) erga dictum Willelmum Paston gessit,
episcopum Londoni de emptione ejusdem manerii per longum tempus
dilatavit, intentione ut idem Willelmus illud emeret si voluerit.'

defaulte mighte be caused by ungodely or unvertuous men, if eny suche
were aboute his persone; he desireth therfore, for the goode of the
King, and for his owne seuretee, to have power and auctoritee to name,
ordeigne, and assigne, and for cause that shal be thought to him
resonable to remoeve thoo that [shal] be aboute the Kinges persone, of
what estate or condicion that thei be, not entending to comprehende in

mowe have speche with my Lordes of Bedford or of Gloucestre, and with
the other Lordes of the Kinges Counsaile, to that ende that, the
defaulte of eny suche persone knowen unto him, shal mowe ordeigne

the favour and goode grace of the King, my Lordes of Bedford and
Gloucestre, and other Lordes of the Kinges Counsail.

_Responsio._ It is agreed as it is desired.

   *   *   *

Item, that considering howe, blessed be God, the King is growen in
yeers, in stature of his persone, and also in conceite and knouleche of
his hiegh and royalle auctoritee and estat, the whiche naturelly causen
him, and from day to day as he groweth shul causen him, more and more to
grucche with chastising, and to lothe it, so that it may resonably be
doubted leste he wol conceive ayeins the said Erle, or eny other that
wol take upon him to chastise him for his defaultes, displesir, or
indignacion therfore, the whiche, without due assistence, is not easy to
be born: It like, therfore, to my Lord of Gloucestre, and to alle the
Lordes of the Kinges Counsail, to promitte to the said Erle, and assure
him, that thei shul fermely and trewely assisten him in the excercise of
the charge and occupacion that he hathe aboute the Kinges persone,
namely in chastising of him for his defaultes, and supporte the said
Erle therinne; and if the King at eny tyme wol conceyve for that cause
indignacion ayeins the said Erle, my said Lord of Gloucestre, and
Lordes, shul do alle her [_i.e._ their] trewe diligence and power to

_Responsio._ It is agreed as it is desired.

   *   *   *

hath be had unto the King at part and in prive, not hering the said Erle
nor eny of the knightes set aboute his persone, nor assigned by the said
Erle, he hath be stured by summe from his lernyng, and spoken to of
diverse materes not behovefull, the seid Erle doubting the harme that

DALLING'S PETITION[38.1]

[Sidenote: 1433(?)]

  Prefixed to this document in Fenn is the following title:--
  'A Petition to the Commons of England against Sir William Paston,
  Knight, a Judge of the Common Pleas, by William Dalling.' This
  heading, however, has been taken from a more modern endorsement. No
  contemporaneous document, so far as I am aware, gives Judge Paston
  the designation of knight, or speaks of him as Sir William. In this
  petition itself he is called simply William Paston, one of the
  Justices; and although his name occurs frequently on the Patent
  Rolls, in commissions of the peace, of gaol delivery, and the like,
  down to the year of his death, the word 'miles' is never appended to
  it.

The original commencement of this document has been crossed out. It was
in these words:--

  Plesit to the righte sage and wyse Communes of this present
  Parlement, that wher every Justice of the Kyng is sworne that he
  shulde not take no fees ne reward for to be of councell with noo
  man, but oonly wyth our Soverayne Lorde the Kyng, and therto thei be
  swore. And ther is oon Will' Paston, one of the Justice of our
  Soverayne Lorde in the Comene Place, taketh fees and rewarde.

  On the back of the original document is written, in a hand of the
  time, 'Falsa billa Will'i Dalling, ad Parliamentum tempore quo Henr.
  Grey fuit vicecomes ante annum terciodecimum Regis Henr. vj^{ti}.'
  Henry Grey was sheriff of Norfolk in 1430, and again in 1433-4. The
  Parliament referred to must either have been that of 8 Hen. VI.
  (1429-30) or that of 12 Hen. VI. (1433), which sat till 21st
  December. Probably the latter.

[Sidenote: 1434(?)]

Plese it to Commines of the present Parlement, that William Paston, on

    [Footnote 44.1: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] The writer of this
    letter was the father of Robert, first Lord Willoughby de Broke,
    who afterwards laid claim to the barony of Latimer, as being
    descended from Elizabeth, sister and sole heir of John Nevill,
    fifth Lord Latimer, who died in 1430. He was, however,
    unsuccessful, as the title had been revived in 1432 by a writ of
    summons to George Nevill, a son of Ralph, first Earl of
    Westmoreland. This George died in 1469, and was succeeded by his
    grandson, Richard Neville, then an infant of two years old, who
    had summons to Parliament as Lord Latimer in 1492. The Lord
    Latimer here spoken of seems to be George Nevill, and it is
    probable that the letter was written between 1432 and 1440, as
    John, Lord Beaumont, was created Viscount in the latter year,
    while he is not so addressed here.]

ABSTRACT[46.1]

[Sidenote: About 1440]

Draft Lease by Sir Simon Felbrygge; Oliver Groos, Esq.; John Berney of
Redham, Esq.; William Paston of Paston; Thomas Stodhagh; Roger Taillour
of Stafford Bernyngham; and Thomas Newport of Runham, executors of
Robert Mawteby and John his son, to Margery, widow of the said John, of
'two parts of manors, &c.' and the reversion, &c., which they lately
held along with Sir Miles Stapleton, Sir William Argenten, Sir John
Hevenyngham, Sir John Carbonell, Sir William Calthorpe, John Boys, Esq.,
and William Caston, Esq., now deceased, by deed of Robert Mawteby. The
remainder, after Margery's death, is to go to Margaret, daughter of the
said John and Margery, and the heirs of her body; then to Peter Mauteby,
son of Robert and uncle of Margaret; then to Alianora, widow of Robert;
then to Alianora, widow of William Calthorp and sister of Robert
Mawteby, with reversion to the trustees to fulfil the will.

  [This paper is addressed to John Berney of Reedham, and appears, by
  an endorsement, to have been transmitted along with a letter of
  William Paston. The date is fixed by the contents within pretty
  narrow limits, for it is after the death of John Boys, Esq., which
  was in August 1439 (Inquis. _post mortem_, 18 Hen. VI., No. 2), and
  before that of Sir Simon Felbrigg in 1442 (Inquis. _p. m._, 21 Hen.
  VI., No. 33). It is easy to see, in fact, that the document had
  something to do with the marriage settlement of John Paston and
  Margaret Mauteby, which was about 1440.]

ABSTRACT[48.1]

---- ---- TO FRIAR BRACKLEY (?).

[Sidenote: About 1440 (?)]

Touching a suit of Reynold Rowse against William Burgeys. This suit was
instituted originally for 5_s._ 4_d._ of rent; but when Rouse found he
could not prevail by right, he maliciously sued the other for trespass
in having fished his water, and driven him away by force. He afterwards
got him arrested for treachery upon an obligation (_i.e._, a bond).
Burgeys complained to Justice Paston, who counselled him not to plead;
'For zyf thu do, he seyd, thu xalte hafe the werse, be thi case never so
trewe, for he is feid with my Lord of [N]orthfolke, and mech he is of he
[_sic_] counsel; and also, thu canst no man of lawe in Northfolke ne in
Sowthfolke to be with the azens hym; and, for [s]othe no more myth I
qwan I had a ple azens hym; and therfor myn counsel is, that thu make an
end qwat so ever the pay, for he xal elles on do the and brynge the to
nowte.'

  [This letter is mutilated, and in part defaced. It is addressed on
  the back-- 'Be this take to Mayster Brele (?) of the Greye Freres.'
  Although the name seems to be written Brele, it was probably
  intended for Friar Brackley of Norwich, of whom we have several
  letters of a later period. The date must be between the year 1429,
  when William Paston was made a judge, and 1444, when he died; and as
  the name of Reginald Rows occurs in Blomefield (_Hist. of Norfolk_,
  ix. 441) 'about 1440,' this letter will probably not be far out of
  its true place if inserted in that year.]

    [Footnote 49.1: [From Fenn, iii. 18.] The date of this letter is
    uncertain. From the fact of John Paston's residence at Peter
    House in Cambridge, it would appear, as Fenn remarks, to have
    been written early in his married life, and we know that he was
    married as early as 1440.]

    [Footnote 49.2: Probably Thomas Wetherby, who was Mayor of
    Norwich in 1432-3, is referred to. He took offence at the
    Aldermen and Commons of the city for not naming the person he
    wished as his successor, and for some years afterwards showed
    his hostility by instigating prosecutions against the city,
    causing their attorneys to abandon their pleas, and so forth.]

DEPOSITION AGAINST JOHN HAWTEYN[52.3]

[Sidenote: 1443 / SEPT. 8]

Primo suggessit Sanctissimo Papae mentiendo quod coactus et constrictus
[fuisset] metu parentum ordinem[52.4] intrare; secundo quod in
insufficienti et prohibita aetate et in eodem ordine invite esset
professus; Et tertio, quod ita fuerat invallatus et inclusus in ordinis
arctitudine ut sibi tempus opportunum exeundi acquirere nequiret. Contra
quae sic depono, non per ficta et fantastice ymaginata, sed per visa et
audita a fide dignis denunciata. Et primo, contra primum articulum,
viz., quod metu parentum etc. quia, ut asserunt fide media quam plures
fide digni quorum nomina perlongum esset enarrare, quod alter parentum,
suple pater, neci submersionis suffocatus fuerat in Themisia diu
antequam ordinem ingressus est praenotatus Johannes; ergo, dissonum
videtur quod metu parentum ingressus est, sed tantum alterius parentis.
Secundo, contra secundum articulum, scilicet quod ex insufficienti etc.,
quia per vere visa et audita a fide dignis personis contra illud
testimonium perhibere volentibus verum est asserere quod xiiij^cim
annorum fuerat aetatis antequam indutus esset; quod sic evidet, quia
natus erat in Swapham Markett, in loco qui Delgate dicitur, ubi parentes
ejus commorabantur, quando primo intraverant villam antedictam pro
annuali stipendio dato Thomae Delgate, cujus erat ipsa mansio, et istud
ad testimonium Adae Ram, Roberti Sergaunte, Agnetis Ymay commatris[53.1]
saepedicti Johannis Hawteyn et Katerinae Gannok, uxoris compatris[53.1]
Johannis Hawteyn praedicti, viz. Johannis Gannok qui obiit anno Domini
mccccxxxiiij(o). Istis transactis, parentes dicti Johannis, viz. Haymundus
Hawteyn, pater ejus, et Claricia Hawteyn mater ejus, conjunctim emerunt
mansionem in eadem villa, viz. Swapham Markett, a Martino Waron anno
regni Regis Ricardi Secundi post conquestum xxij(o), quod datum, suple
Regis Ricardi, praecessit nativitas Johannis Hawteyn in Delgate per
testimonia praeallegata. De facili ergo, probatur quod sit aetatis annorum
xliiij(o)r ad minus, enumerando a xxij(o) anno regni Regis Ricardi Secundi
post conquestum usque ad annum xxj^m Henrici Sexti.

   *   *   *

Omnia in hac cedula quo ad Hawteyn dicta fuerunt Jacobo Gresham viij(o)
die Septembris anno Regis Henrici vj^ti xxij(o), prout scribuntur. Frater
Johannes Alburugh dicit quod hoc medio intravit Johannes Hawteyn in
ordinem. Circa xij. annum aetatis suae missus fuit London' essend' cum
quodam Thoma Brown modo apprenticii; quod actum fuit, quodque sibi non
bene complacuit, et cucurrit ad Fratres et dixit quod fuit nepos
Alburugh, et ea de causa Reverendus Magister Walden[54.1] interrogavit
eum si vellet esse frater, et dixit quod vellet et humiliter rogavit ex
caritate. Et veraciter scit quod fuit aetatis xiiij. annorum et amplius
tempore professionis suae et moram traxit ibidem per iij. vel iiij.
annos. Et postea fuit apud Maldon per duos annos, et ab illo loco exiit.
Deinde captus et Norwico incarceratus per dimidium annum. Et postea in
domo de Blakney per iiij(o)r annos mansit, et ibidem fuit terminarius et
hospes; et cucurrit ab inde cum vestibus officii de domo hospicii
furtive et cepit librum (?) Alburugh avunculi sui et canciavit illum
apud Aylesham pro iiij. marcis et dimidia, quas dictus Alburugh solvit
pro libro rehabendo.

Et addidit idem Johannes Hawteyn vel Alburugh frater et avunculus dicti
Johannis Hawteyn quod Johannes Hawteyn apostata fuit natus apud Swafham
Market circa iiij. annum post transitum patris sui a Scheryngton usque
Swafham. Et dicit quod Robertus frater ejus fuit pluris aetatis quam
Johannes fuit per iiij(o)r annos, et dictus Robertus fuit natus apud
Scherynton.

Et serviens Daubeney dicit quod Hamond Hawteyn transivit a Scheryngton
usque Swafham tempore quo Thomas Erpyngham custodivit Regem R. in Turre
London.[54.2]

Stephanus Plattyng de Aylesham pro vero dicit quod ad Festum
Purificationis Beatae Mariae anno regni Regis Henrici vj^ti xxj(o) elapsi
fuerunt xxviij(o) anni postquam ipse primo habitavit in dicta villa de
Aylesham; quo tempore Claricia quae fuit uxor Hamonis Hawteyn fuit vidua
et commorans in messuagium nunc Johannis Draper de Aylesham, et postea
nupta fuit Petro Fysch, caeco, qui insimul vixerunt vj. vel vij. annos,
et post obitum dicti Petri dicta Claricia cepit in virum Willelmum
Punyant de Aylesham. Et ad dictum festum Purificationis Beatae Mariae
dicto anno xxj(o) dicti Ponyant et Claricia insimul in matrimonio
cohabitaverunt per xxij. annos. Hoc de Pounyant cum Claricia affirmant.
Et dicit idem Ponyant quod frater Johannes Hawteyn professus fuit post
matrimonium inter ipsum et praefatam Clariciam et quod ipse ad ultimum
exitum suum de ordine praedicto dimisit capam suam in domo dicti Ponyant
apud Aylesham.

Willelmus Barbour dicit quod quo ad nativitatem Johannis Hawteyn penitus
ignorat, sed dicit quod habet quendam (_sic_) filiam aetatis xliiij(o)r
annorum, et ultra vel circa, et dicit quod Johannes Hawteyn est talis
aetatis. Et dicit quod Tiphania soror Hawteyn est manens in villa ultra
London vocata Hawehunte, sed in quo comitatu ignorat.

OXNEAD AND FRIAR HAWTEYN[60.1]

[Sidenote: 1443-9]

This day at x. of the clok Edmund Paston and the parson of Oxened went
owth of the Manor doun to Wantown Gapp, for thei herd tydynges that the
freyr[60.2] was comyng; and with the seyd frier came John Cates and on
Whalter Herman of Wheytte, and Wylliam Yemmys of Burgh, the frieres man.
And Edmund Paston seyd to John Cates Welcome, and he askyd hem what
here[60.3] cause was in commyng. The Frier seyd he cam for to speke with
the gode lady, and Edmund seyd that he shuld speke with her. At this
tyme sche was so ocupied he myth not speke with her. And he seyd that he
shuld assay; and he cam redyng fro Wantown Gappe to the grete Cate; and
there he lyted and knokkyd on the gate; and we folwyd as yarn as we
myth; and ther was with in John Jaallere and John Edmundes, and asked
the friere what he wold; and he seyd that he wuld comyn inne for to
speke with the gode ladi of the hows. And thei seyd nay, he shuld not
come in. And than cam on Edmund Paston and the parson, and asked hym
what was cause of his comyng at this tyme. And he seyd for to entre in
the maner of Oxened, the which his fader was possessid of and his
auncestres from kyng Edward the thred on to Colbys tyme, and that he had
fownd a tayll ther of in the kynges bokes. And than Edmund Paston

that I am kept owth with stronge hand, and may not take poscession.' And
evyn forth with he presyd to the gate ward to a leyd hand on the gate.
And than the seyd Edmund put hym fro the gate and seyd, 'Ne wer for
reverence of thy lord and myn, and thow leyst any hand on the gate I
xall sey thye hert blod or thow myn.' And than the seyd frier seyd
scornfully that he myth thanke his mayster. And than the seyd Edmund

poscession skylled nowgt. And than the friere seyd that sen he myth not
have it nowe, he shuld come a geyn a nothir tyme. Edmund is rede forth
to Heydon. It was told us this afternon that ther wer iij. men come fro
Skeyton and mette with the frier in the feld and spoke with hym a gode
while, and than redyn the same wey that they come.

    [Footnote 61.1: [From Fenn, iii. 26.] 'From a memorandum,' says
    Fenn, 'on the back of this letter, dated in April 1444, it is
    probable that it was written on the 30th of January 1443.' Did
    Fenn mean the 30th of January 1443-4? In the side-note
    immediately below the letter, he dates it in his usual exact
    manner, 'Wednesday, 30th of January 1443, 22 H. vi.' But
    unfortunately there is an error here. January in the 22d year of
    Henry VI., means January 1444 according to the modern
    computation, or 1443 in the style formerly in use, by which the
    year was reckoned from the 25th of March. But the 30th of
    January was a Wednesday in 1443, only according to the modern
    computation of the year,--that is to say, it was a Wednesday in
    the year 1442-3, not in 1443-4. I imagine, however, that the
    '30th of January' should have been '29th of January,' and that
    Fenn really meant 1443-4, corresponding with the 22nd year of
    Henry VI.; for the memorandum to which he refers is a draft
    agreement, dated on Passion Sunday, 22 Hen. VI., A.D. 1444.]

    [Footnote 68.4: [From Fenn, i. 10.] Fenn thinks this letter must
    have been written before 1444, when Yelverton was made a judge.
    This is, doubtless, most probable. There is, however, an Edmund
    Swathing, Esq., mentioned by Blomefield (_Hist. of Norfolk_,
    viii. 42) as alive in 1446, and if it be his executors who are
    referred to, the date would appear to be later.]

    curious monogram, in which every letter both of the Christian
    and the surname can be traced.]

    [Footnote 71.1: [From Fenn, iii. 16.] The writer of this letter
    was the widow of John Mowbray, second Duke of Norfolk, who died
    in 1432. After the Duke's death, she married again no less than
    three times; and Fenn thinks this letter, which is dated from
    Epworth in Lincolnshire, a seat of the Duke of Norfolk's, was
    probably written during her first widowhood. It must be
    remarked, however, that in 1432 John Paston was only twelve
    years old at the utmost, so that this letter could hardly have
    been written till at least ten years after. It is, besides,
    hardly probable that John Paston would have been addressed as
    the owner of a 'place' in London, before his father's death in
    1444. The exact year, however, is quite uncertain.]

21 Oct., at London.--Letter from Fastolf to Thomas Howys and John Grene,
desiring them to procure information about one Robert Eccles, cousin and
heir to John Eccles, whom the counsel for the prior of Hickling propose
to call to give evidence about the rent of 25 marks.

1447, [26 Oct.] 'Thursday byfore S. Symond and Jude,' 26 Hen. VI. at
Castre. Long letter from Thomas Howys in reply to the preceding, with
the results of searches made in the Bishop's registry for wills of the

ABSTRACTS[81.1]

THE PRIOR OF HICKLING.

_Hickling 71._

[14 . . ] At Westminster.

_Letter_ [on paper, in English] from two counsel, _William Wangeford_
and _William Jenney_, to Sir John Fastolf, giving their opinion on his
claim against the prior of Hickling. Sir John cannot recover the L20
forfeit, because the condition of the obligation only extended to the
heirs of Sir Hugh Clifford, and not to his assigns, and Sir John is only
an assign; but the rent of 25 marks is sure to him, and he can recover
it, if denied by the prior, by process of law; they will consult with
justices and serjeants whether he can recover it by distraint.

_Hickling 74._

[14 . . ] Friday in the 2nd week after Easter at Lenne.

_Letter_, [in English, on paper] from _Henry Notyngham_ to Sir Henry
Barton, Alderman of London. Has counselled with Paston, and finds him
more friendly and ready to help in Barton's matter than ever before;
supposes that the cause is, that the prior that was obstinate is dead,
and another appointed, who Paston trusts will be more easy to stir.
Desires that Paston may be thanked. Sends a letter which he desires
'a child of zours' may carry to Mistress Jenkin Leventhorpe the younger;
and ask at my lord's inn of Doreham or of Ratclyff or some other which
he may think best, if he (_i.e._ my Lord of Durham) shall be at this
Parliament. Send to Thomelin Grys, spicer at Norwich, some 'loder,' as
soon as he can goodly buy it, which comes each week to Rossamez Inn in
St. Laurence's Lane.

_Hickling 75._

[14 . . ] 14 Apr., at Norwich.

_Letter_, [in English, on paper] from _H[enry] Notyngham_ to Sir Henry
Barton, alderman of London. Delivered Paston the copy of the deeds;
shewed his letter to the prior and convent, but gained nothing; they
said they would please Barton full fain, but all their counsel are full
against their binding themselves by any such confirmation; they were
bound to the former owner and his heirs, but not to his assigns. Advises
him to get good counsel, and thinks nothing can be done unless he gets
Paston's assent and grant to help the matter.

_Hickling 89._

[1450 _or_ 1451?] 18 Aug. Norwich.

_Letter_ [in English, on paper] _from_ '_W. [Hart], Bisshope of
Norwich_,' to Sir John Fastolf. Has put himself greatly in his devoir to
put an end to the controversy between Fastolf and the house of Hykelyng,
and has been so importunate that Lord Scales has advised him not to
meddle in the matter, because he is taken as a suspect person; if he
could do him more profit, he would not spare labour or cost, on account
of Fastolf's towardness and gentleness to condescend unto right and
reasonable mean, the which he conceives not in the other party. Had
hoped his good and devout purpose towards the place of St. Bennett's
would have grown to some good conclusion; was there the Sunday before
St. Laurence's Day, and greatly rejoiced at such work and cost as he has
done there. Heartily desires him to come here to the air of his natural
birth, where he will find my Lord of Norfolk and such attendance as the
Bishop and other gentles of the country may do, ready unto him at all
times; his coming would be to his health and heart's ease, and the cause
of much peace in the country.

_Letter_, [in English, on paper] from _Lord Scales_ to Sir John Fastolf,
asking him to withdraw an outlawry which has been issued against John
Dowebegyng, servant of the former, for a debt of L100 due to Fastolf by
Thomas Danyell, Esq., for which Dowebegyng had become bound.

Signed by Lord Scales, who adds a postscript in his own hand that
Fastolf has been as faithful and kind to him since he came into England
as he was in France, and that there is no one of his estate for whom he
would do so much.

MARGARET PASTON TO JOHN PASTON[84.1]

_To my ryth wyrchypful hwsbond, Jon Paston, be this lettyr delyveryd in
hast._

[Sidenote: 1448 / APRIL]

Ryth wyrchypful hwsbond, I recomawnd me to zw, desyryng hertyly to heryn
of zour wel fare, praying zw to wete that I was with my Lady
Morley[84.2] on the Satyrday next after that ze departyd from hens, and
told here qhat answer that ze had of Jon Butt, and sche toke it ryth
straw[n]gely, and seyd that sche had told zw, and schewyd zw i now
[_enough_], qher by ze myth have knowleche that the releve owt [_ought_]
to ben payd to her. And sche seyd sche wyst wel that ze delay it forthe,
that sche xuld nowth have that longyth to her ryth. And sche told me hw
it was payd in Thomas Chawmbers tym, qhan her dowther Hastyngs[84.3] was
weddyd; and sche seyd sythyn that ze wyl make none end with her, sche
wyl sew therfore as law wyl.

I conseyvyd be here that sche had cwnsel to labore azens zw therin
withyn ryth schort tym. And than I prayd her that sche wuld vwche save
nowth to labowr azens zw in this mater tyl ze kom hom; and sche seyd
nay, be her feyth, sche wuld no more days zeve [_give_] zw therin. Sche
seyd sche had sett zw so many days to a kord with her, and ze had broke
them, that sche was ryth wery therof; and sche seyd sche was but a
woman, sche must don be her cownseyl, and her cwnseyle had avysyd her,
so sche seyd sche wyld do. Than I prayd her azyn that sche wuld teryn
[_tarry_] tyl ze kom hom, and I seyd I trostyd veryly that ze wuld don
qhan ze kom hom, as itt longeth to zw to don; and if ze myth have very
knowleche that sche awyth of ryth for to have itt, I seyd I wyst wel
that ze wuld pay it with ryth gode wyl, and told her that ze had sergyd
to a fownd wrytyng therof, and ze kwd non fynd in non wyse. And sche
sayd sche wyst wele there was wrytyng therof inow, and sche hath wrytyng
therof hw Syr Robert of Mawthby, and Sir Jon, and my grawnsyre, and
dyverse other of myn awncesterys payd it, and seyd nevyre nay therto.
And in no wyse I kwd not geyn no grawnth of her to sesyn tyl ze kom hom;
and sche bad me that I xuld don an erand to my moder, and qhan I kam
hom, I dede myn erand to her. And sche axyd me if I had spokyn to my
lady of this forseyd mater, and I told her hw I had do, and qhat answer
I had; and sche seyd sche xuld gon to my Lady Morles on the nexst day,
and sche xuld speken to her therof, and a say to getyn grawnt of her to
sesyn of the forsayd mater tyl that ze kom hom. And truly my moder dede
her dever ryth feythfully therin, as my cosyn Clare[85.1] xal tellyn zw
qhan that he speketh with zow; and sche gete grawnt of my seyd lady that
there xuld nowth ben don azens zw therin, and ze wold acordyn with her,
and don as ze owyn to do be twyx this tym and Trinyte Sunday.

Laueraw[n]ce Rede of Mawthhy recommawndeth hym to zu, and prayt zw that
ze wyl vwchesave to leten hym byn [_buy_] of zw the ferm barly that ze
xuld have of hym, and if ze wyl laten hym have it to a resonabyl pris,
he wyl have it with ryth a gode wyl; and he prayit zw if ze wyl that he
have it, that ze wyl owche save [_vouchsafe_] to send hym word at qhat
pris he xuld have the kowmb as hastyly as ze may, and ellys he must be
purvayd in other plase.

As twchyng other tydyngs, I sopose Jon of Dam xal send zw word in a
letter. As it is told me veryly, Heydon xal not kom at London this term.

It is seyd in this contre that Danyell[86.1] is owth of the Kyngs gode
grase, and he xal dwn and all hys mene, and all that ben hys wele
wyllers; there xal no man ben so hardy to don nether seyn azens my Lord
of Sowthfolk,[86.2] nere non that longeth to hym; and all that have don
and seyd azens hym, they xul sore repent hem. Kateryn Walsam xal be
weddyd on the Munday nexst after Trinyte Sonday, as it is told me, to
the galaunte with the grete chene; and there is purvayd for her meche
gode aray of gwnys, gyrdelys, and atyrys, and meche other gode aray, and
he hathe purcheysyd a gret purcheys of v. mark be zer to zevyn her to
her joynture.

I am aferd that Jon of Sparham is so schyttyl wyttyd, that he wyl sett
hys gode to morgage to Heydon, or to sum other of ywre gode frendys, but
if [_i.e._ unless] I can hold hym inne the better, ere ze kom hom. He
hath ben arestyd sythyn that ye went, and hath had moche sorw at the
sewte of mayster Joh Stoks of London for x. mark that Sparham owt to
hym; and in gode feyth he hath had so moche sorow and hevynesse that he
wyst nowth qhat he myth don. I fell hym so disposyd that he wold asold
and asett to morgage all that he hath, he had nowth rowth to qhom, so
that he myth an had mony to an holpyn hym self wyth; and I entretyd hym
so, thatt I sopose he wyll nother sellyn ner sett to morgage, nother
catel ner other gode of hese, tyl he speke with zw. He soposeth that al
that is don to hym is att the request of the Parson of Sparham and
Knatylsale. I sopose it is almas to comfort hym, for in gode feyth he is
ryth hevy, and hys wyf al so. He is nowth nw under arest, he hath payd
hys feys, and goth at large; he was arestyd att Sparham, of on of
Knatysales men.

Hodge Feke told me thatt Sym Schepherd is styl with Wylly,[86.3] and if
ze wyl I xal purvey that he xal be browth hom er ze kom hom. It is told
me that he that kept zour schep was owth lawyd on Munday at the swth of
Sir Thomas Todynham, and if it be so, ze arn nowth lyk to kepe hym
longe. And as twchyng that that ze badeyn me spekyn for to Bakton, he
seyth he is wel avysyd that sche seyd sche wuld never have to don with
all, ner he kan not pek that sche seyd sche hath non ryth to have it,
and he wyl say lyche as he hath herd her seyd; and if sche speke to hym
therof, he wyll rather hold with zw than with her. I pray ye that ze wyl

ABSTRACT[88.1]

MARGARET PASTON TO HER HUSBAND (_not addressed_).

[Sidenote: 1448 / MAY 19]

On Friday last, the Parson of Oxened 'being at messe in one Parossh
Chirche, evyn at levacion of the sakeryng, Jamys Gloys had been in the
town, and come homeward by Wymondam's gate,' when he was attacked by
Wymondham who had two of his men with him, and driven into 'my mother's
place' for refuge. With the noise of this, my mother and I came out of
the church from the sakeryng, and Wymondham 'called my mother and me
strong whores, and said, ye Pastons and all her kin were . . . . . . .
yngham said he lied, knave and churl as he was.' After noon my mother
and I reported this to the Prior of Norwich, who sent for Wymondham;
and Pagrave came with us. While Wymondham was with the Prior, and we at
home, Gloys was assaulted again in the street, 'as he stood in the Lady
Hastyngs' chamber,' by Thomas Hawys, one of Wymondham's men. This last
assault the Parson of Oxened saw. Sends Gloys to her husband for fear of
further trouble. The Lady Morle 'would have the benefice of her
obligacion,' as her counsel tells her it is forfeit, and she would not
have the relief till she have your homage. The Lord Moleyns' man is
collecting the rent at Gresham 'a great pace,' as James Gresham will
report to you.

  Trinity Sunday, at even.

  Further statement about the assault added in a different hand
  (qu. Agnes Paston's?).

  [From the fact of Lord Molyns being in possession of Gresham, and
  collecting rents there, it is clear that the date of this letter is
  1448. This date also agrees with what is said in Letter 75 about a
  relief claimed by Lady Morley.]

  On the back are some names of families in a contemporary hand, and
  five shields of arms tricked in a modern hand, the latter being
  apparently the armorial bearings of ancestors of the Earl of
  Yarmouth, to whom there is a letter addressed by 'Wm. Smyth' upon
  this subject at f. 146 of the MS.

    [Footnote 91.1: [Add. MS. 34,889, f. 143.] This letter is
    neither signed nor addressed, but there is no doubt the person
    for whom it was intended was John Paston the eldest, who
    possessed property at Mautby in right of his wife. The reference
    to Laurence Reede seems further to show that it is of the year
    1448. See p. 85.]

JAMES GLOYS TO JOHN PASTON[92.1]

_To my Ryght Wurchepfull master John Paston be this deliuered in hast._

[Sidenote: 1448 / DEC. 3]

Right reverent and wurchepfull sir, I recommande me to yow, desyryng to
here of yowr welfare, the which gracyows God contynually preserve and
kepe to yowr gostly hele and bodily welfare; praying yow to wete that as
for the broke sylver that my mastres wend for to a sent yow whan she
dede wryte her letter, ther is none in your forcer; she supposyd that ye
left it at Norwiche in yowr cofere, wher of ye have the key. Also my
mastres yowr moder grete yow wele, and pray yow to send her word how she
shall do with Edward of Whode of Paston; for she dede seys his corn on
the lond the last hervest, and he led it a wey after that it whas seysyd
with awth licens and leve of here or any of here offyceris. Item, my
mastres yowr syster recommand her hertly to yow, and pray yow that and
ye wold wochesaff to speke to my master Edmund, and pray hym if that he
hath bowth here ger that she sent to hym fore, that he wold send it her
home; in cas that[93.1] he have not bowth it, that he wold be it and
sent it here in all the hast that he may goodly. Forthermore if it plese
yow to her of my master Berney, he was at Gresham with my mastres on the
Tuysday next after Halwemasday, the same day that we dystreynyd Jamys
Rokkysson, and I had mette a litill a fore with Pertrych, and he thrett
me, and sayd that we shuld not long kepe the dystresse, and there for my
mastres dede us don on owr jakkys and owr salettis. My master Berney cam
in and the parson of Oxened with hym and sey us in owre jakkis, and he
wexe as pale as any herd and wold right fayn a ben thens. So my mastres
dede hym dyne, and whill thei wher at dynar Herry Collys told my mastres
openly among us all that the same tyme that Pertrych entryd a geyn up on
yow, his master was at Causton to yow ward, and there it was told hym
that Pertrych had putt yow owth and all your men, and that ye and my
mastres wher redyn a geyn to Norwhich, and all your howshold, and that
causyd hym that he cam no forther that tyme; and my Master Berney
confermyd all this and seyd that it was so. Whan thei had etyn he had
mych hast to a be thens, so my mastres desyryd and prayd hym that he
wold come a geyn or aght long; and so with mych praying he be hest her
if he mythe. And Herry Collys stode ther bysyde and seyd to my felachep,
'What shuld my master do here,' quod he, 'lete yowr master send after
his kynnysmen at Mautby, for thei have nowth that thei mawn lese.' And
so thei redyn her wey. And with in a sevenygt after my master Berney
sent Davy to my mastres, and prayd my mastres that she wold hold his
master excusyd, for he had hurt his owyn hors that he rode up on; and he
dede Davy sadillyn an oder hors; and he stode by and made water whill he
sadyllyd hym, and as Davy shuld a kyrt the hors, he slenkyd behynd and
toke his master on the hepe suyche a stroke that never man may trust hym
after, and brake his hepe. And he had sent Herry Collys to Norwhich for
medycynys, so he must ryde hom the same nygt; for his master had no man
at home. So my mastres was rygth sory, and wend that it had be trowth,
but I know wele that it was not so. It happyd that I rod the next day to
Norwhich, and I rood in to my mastres your moder, and she dede aske me
after my master Berney, and I told here how he was hurt. And she askyd
the parson of Oxened if he wer hurt, and he seyd nay; for Davy lay with
hym the same nygt a fore and told hym that he was heyll and mery, and
prayd hym that he wold be with hym the Sonday next after; and so Davy
lay the same nygt after that he had told my mastres the tale with the
parson of Oxened. I beseche yow of yowre gode masterchep that ye wold
not do wreythe this letter, for and my mastres knew that I sent yow
suyche a letter I were never abyll to loke up on her, nor to abyde in
her heysyte. My mastres yowr moder hath sent yow ij. letteris; she hath
in dosyd hem to my master Edmunde, and she wuld wete if ye had hem or
nawth. The Holy Trynyte have yow in kepyng. Wrytyne at Norwhich on Sent
Clementis evyn. In hast.

Right worchipfull hosbond, I recommand me to yow, praying yow to wete

I sent yow a letter wreten on Tesday last past, whiche, as I suppose,

    [Footnote 94.1: [From Fenn, iii. 408.] Fenn thinks this was
    written about 1460, but I do not see on what evidence. From the
    reference to Gresham, I should rather suppose it belongs to
    1449. By the subscription, it would appear that the writer was
    very near the time of lying in; but we cannot tell the exact
    date of the birth of any of her children. Lord Molyns
    dispossessed John Paston of the lordship of Gresham on the 17th
    of February 1448. After repeated remonstrances on the subject to
    no purpose, Paston went and took up his quarters there again on
    the 6th October 1449, and succeeded in keeping possession till
    the 28th January 1450, when the place was attacked, in his
    absence, by Lord Molyns' men, who undermined the walls, and
    drove out Paston's wife. The 'errands about Gresham' probably
    refer to the time of Lord Molyns' first occupation.]

    [Footnote 95.1: No notice is taken elsewhere of John Paston
    having a brother named Harry.]

MARGARET PASTON TO JOHN PASTON[95.2]

[Sidenote: 1449 / FEB. 28]

Begs him not to be displeased though she be out of the place he left her
in; for she heard such tidings that she durst not abide there. Divers of
my Lord Moleyns' men said if they might get her they would steal her and
keep her in the castle; 'and than they said they would that ye should
fetch me out. They said it should be but a little heartburning to you.'
After that I could have no rest till I was here. I did not venture out
of the place till I was ready to ride, and no one knew an hour before
but the good wife, whom I told that I was coming here to get gear made
for me and the children. I beg you will keep secret the cause of my
coming away till I see you. I spoke with your mother on my way hither,
who offered to let me abide in her place if you wished me to stay in
Norwich, and to give me such gear as she could spare till you can be
purveyed of a place of your own. Let me know what to do. I should be
sorry to dwell so near Grassam as I did, till the matter between you and
the Lord Moleyns is settled. Barow said there was no better evidence in
England than Lord M. had of Gressam. I said I supposed they were such as
William Hasard spoke of, the seals of which were not yet cold, and that
you had evidence with seals 200 years older. Do not on any account trust
Lord Moleyns and his men, or eat or drink with them, though they speak
ever so fair. Roger Foke of Sparham dare not leave his house for the
suit Heydon and Wyndham have against him. Watkin Shipdam wishes you to
speak to Sir J. Fastolf about the harness you had of him, etc.

    [Footnote 96.1: [From Fenn, iii. 80.] There is no distinct clue
    to the date of this letter; but Fenn throws out a conjecture
    which, in default of any better guide, may be accepted as not
    improbable, that 'the Bishop of the other side of the sea' was
    Walter Lyhert, Bishop of Norwich, who in the beginning of 1449
    must have been in Savoy, having been sent thither by the King to
    persuade the anti-pope Felix V. to renounce his claim to
    Nicholas V. for the peace of the Church. This Felix actually did
    in the beginning of this year, and Wharton considers Bishop
    Lyhert to have been the cause of his doing so (Angl. Sac. i.
    418). Fenn, however, dates this letter 1450, on the supposition
    that the Bishop would have been still abroad in the beginning of
    that year, which is a mistake, as his name appears in the Rolls
    of Parliament as a trier of petitions as early as February.]

the Lord Moleynys, and schewyd her the same letter, praying hym that he
wold seyn to his frends and wele willerres in this contre that he
thanketh hem of her godewill, and for that thei have done for hym; and
also praying Heydon that he wold sey to Rychard Ernold of Crowmer that
he was sory and evyl payd that his men maden the afray up on hym, for he
seyd it was not be his will that his men xuld make afray on noman in
this contre with owth rytz grett cause. And as for that was don to zu if
it mytz ben prevyd that he had don otherwise to zu than rytz wold as for
the mevabyl godis, ze xuld ben content, so that ze xuld have cawse to
kon hym thank; and he prayd Heydon in the letter that it xuld ben
reportid in this kontre that he wold don so, if he had don otherwyse
than he owth to don.

The frere[100.1] that cleymyth Oxned was in this town zastyrday and this

wote not. He seyd pleynly in this town that he xal have Oxnede, and that
he hath my lord of Suffolkes[100.2] good lordschip, and he wol ben his
good lord in that mater. There was a persone warnyd my moder with in
this to days that sche xuld ben ware, for thei seyd pleynly sche was lyk
to ben servyd as ze were servyd at Gressam with in rytz schort tyme.
Also the Lord Moleyns wrott in his forseyd letter that he wold mytyly,

frends and his wel willers in the mater towching Gressam, and preyd
Heydon that he wold sey to them that thei xuld not ben aferd in non

    [Footnote 99.2: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] The date of this letter
    is evidently both after Paston's expulsion from Gresham by Lord
    Molyns in February 1448, and after the death of Edmund Paston in
    1449. It cannot, however, be so late as 1450, else Hauteyn would
    not have expected to obtain possession of Oxnead through the
    Duke of Suffolk's influence.]

    from Margaret Paston to her husband; and the paper is likewise
    so completely filled with writing, that she has not even either
    subscribed or dated it, but by the mentioning of Sir John
    Fastolf it must have been written before 1459.' It appears to us
    most probably to belong to the year 1449, when Paston was making
    preparations to re-enter Gresham, which he actually did in
    October of that year.]

Schrowpe[108.4] after that he had byen with me at Norwyche, and tolde

He had swyche wordys to my cosyn Cler that lesse than ze made hym good

I sent zow a letter by Brawnton for sylke, and for this matyr befor my

ELIZABETH CLERE TO JOHN PASTON[109.2]

_To my Cosyn, John Paston, be thys letter delivered._

[Sidenote: Not after 1449]

Trusty and weel be loved cosyn, I comaunde me to zow, desyryng to here
of zowre weelfare and good spede in zowre matere, the qwech I prey God
send zow to his plesaunce and to zoure hertys ease.

Cosyn, I lete zow wete that Scrope[109.3] hath be in this cuntre to se
my cosyn zoure sustyr, and he hath spoken with my cosyn zoure moder, and
sche desyreth of hym that he schuld schewe zow the endentures mad be
twen the knyght that hath his dowter and hym, whethir that Skrop, if he
were maried and fortuned to have children, if tho children schuld
enheryte his lond, or his dowter, the wheche is maried.

Cosyn, for this cause take gode hede to his endentures, for he is glad
to schewe zow hem, or whom ze wol a sygne with zow; and he seith to me
he is the last in the tayle of his lyflode, the qweche is CCCL. marke
and better, as Watkyn Shipdam seith, for he hath take a compt of his
liflode dyvers tymes; and Scrop seith to me if he be maried, and have a
sone an eyre, his dowter that is maried schal have of his liflode L.
marke and no more; and therfore, cosyn, me semeth he were good for my
cosyn zowre sustyr, with[out] that ye myght gete her a bettyr. And if ze
can gete a better, I wold avyse zow to labour it in as schort tyme as ze
may goodly, for sche was never in so gret sorow as sche is now a dayes,
for sche may not speke with no man, ho so ever come, ne not may se ne
speke with my man, ne with servauntes of hir moderys but that sche
bereth hire an hand[110.1] otherwyse than she menyth. And sche hath sen
Esterne the most part be betyn onys in the weke or twyes, and som tyme
twyes on o day, and hir hed broken in to or thre places. Wherfor, cosyn,
sche hath sent to me by Frere Newton in gret counsell, and preyeth me
that I wold send to zow a letter of hir hevynes, and prey yow to be hir
good brothyr, as hir trost is in zow; and sche seith, if ze may se be
his evydences that his childern and hire may enheryten, and sche to have
resonable joynture, sche hath herd so mech of his birth and his
condicions, that and ze will sche will have hym, whethyr that hir moder
wil or wil not, not withstandyng it is tolde hir his persone is symple,
for sche seyth men shull have the more deyute of hire if sche rewle hire
to hym as sche awte to do.

Cosyn, it is told me ther is a goodly man in yowre Inne, of the qweche
the fadyr deyed litte, and if ze thynk that he were better for hir than
Scroop, it wold be laboured, and yif Scroop a goodly answere that he be
not put of tyl ze be sure of a bettyr; for he seid whan he was with me,
but if [_i.e._ unless] he have som counfortable answer of zow, he wil no
more laboure in this mater, be cause he myght not se my cosyn zoure
sustyr, and he seyth he myght a see hire and sche had be bettyr than she
is; and that causeth hym to demyr that hir moder was not weel willyng,
and so have I sent my cosyn zowre moder word. Wherfore, cosyn, thynk on
this mateer, for sorow oftyn tyme causeth women to be set hem otherwyse
than thei schuld do, and if sche where in that case, I wot weel ze wold
be sory. Cosyn, I prey zow brenne this letter, that zoure men ne non
other man se it; for and my cosyn zowre moder knew that I had sent yow
this letter, sche shuld never love me. No more I wrighte to zow at this
tyme, but Holy Gost have zow in kepyng. Wretyn in hast, on Seynt Peterys

_To my ryght worshepfull master John Paston at London in the Inner
Temple._

[Sidenote: 1449 / NOV. 30]

Plese it your good maistershep to knowe that my maisteresse your wyff
recomaundeth here to yow and fareth well, blyssed be God, and all your
menye faren well also and recomaunde hem to yaw, &c. I was with my lord
of Oxenford and dede myn erand, and I found his good lordshep well
disposed towardys yow, for he seid if he were sent to for to come to,
&c., if it kepe faire weder he wold not tarye, and if it reygned he wold
not spare. More over I spak with Pertrych as touchyng the letter sent to
my lord Moleyns; he seyth that he was privy to the wrytyng and wele a
vowe it by record of xx. persons, but he wold name to me no persone; and
so he and I accorded not fully. And I bad hym remembre hym that he myght
not abyde there if ye wold have hym owt. And he seid he knewe well that.
But he seid, if ye put heem out, ye shuld be put owt sone after a geyn.
And I seyd if it happe it so thei shuld not longer reste there. And
Mariot stod by and seyd that were no merveyll whill thei were but ij.
men, but it shuld not be best so. And I seyd that I lete them wete it
shuld be so if ye wold, thow they made all the strenght which they coude
make. And ther to Mariot seyd stately, that myght not be performed; and
more langage ther was, to long to wryte at this leyser. Pertrych and his
felaw bere gret visage and kepe gret junkeryes and dyneres, and seyn
that my lord Moleynes hath wrytyn pleynly to hem that he is lord there
and well be, and shall be, and ye not to have it; but I trust to Goddes
ryghtwysenes of better purvyaunce. Lyke it yow to remembre what Heydon
doth and mayde by colour of justice of the pees, beyng of my lordes
councell and not your good frend nor weell wyller, and to comon with
your sad councell what ye must suffre by the lawe, and where inne ye may
resiste. On Sunday last passed Gunore and Mariot and John Davy and other
dyned with Pertrych, &c.; and after eveson [_evensong_] Gonore spake to
my maisteresse that she shuld make here men to leue here wyfeles and
here jackes; and she answered that thei purposed to hurte no man of here
owyn sykyng; but for it was seid that she shuld be plukkyd owt of here
howse, she were loth to suffre that; and therfore she sayde thei shuld
goo soo til ye come hom. And he seid stately, but if thei left here aray
it shuld be plukked from them. I trust he must have a better warant,
from his stately langage, or ells he shall not have it from hem esily.
All this I remitte to your good remembraunce with Goddes help, to Whom I
pray to gyde your ryght to his worshep and your hertes desire.

'The King is now into the Marches of Wales, as it is said, to the intent
he may be near the country if my Lord of Buckingham, which is
commissioner now in Wales for divers offences done there to the Crown,
would sue to have his commission to be enlarged, if he were repyned.' It
is not known when the King will be in London again, but he is expected
here at the beginning of the Parliament. I have your writs of error, but
can see nothing wrong. Thos. Denys asked me why you did not follow his
suggestion about the removing of the strength at Gresham, and thinks it
should be done yet. Francis Costard is not yet well at ease, for his
_venire facias_ between Will. Prentys and him and Hen. Halman comes in
very inopportunely. You had better come hither as soon as possible and
get the favor of the sheriff that shall be next year.

consenteth that the sayde Scrope marie hym to the Fauconeris doughter,
with that that the sayde Fauconer gyf to the sayde Fastolf the saide
somme of v^c. marke, the whiche he payde for the saide Scrope.

Item, yf that the sayde Stephen Scrope pay or do pay the somme afore
sayde of v^c. marke sterling, than the sayde Sir John Fastolf and Dame
Mylicent,[114.3] his wyf, schall make astate of the said maner of

Item, if that the sayde Fauconer wilnot gyf no somme of golde for the

Item, ze sende me be Raufm[an an] answare o[f] the letters that y sende

And or (_sic_) have zow in his kepyng. Wretyn at Roan (?)[116.2] the

Lordship that ye have shewed me at all tymes, beseching you alway of
gode contynuance.

Plesid your gode Lordship to be remembred how afore this tyme Hugh
Wythom hath said he wold be in rest and peese with me, and not to
maligne agayn me otherwise than lawe and right wold; that
notwithstandyng, upon Munday last past, he and iij. men with him come
unto a servaunt hous of myn in Boston, cald William Shirref, and there,
as he sete at his werke, stroke him upon the hede and in the body with a
dagger, and wondet him sore, and pulled him out of his hous, and set him
in prison without any cause resonabull, or without writ, or any other
processe shewid unto him; and that me semes longs not for him to do, bot
as he says he is endited, and as your gode Lordship knawes wele, I and
all my servaunts are in like wise; bot and any man shuld have done hit,
it longs either to the shirref or to your baliff as I conceyve, and
other cause he had non to him as fer as I kan knawe, bot awnly for the
malissiousness that he hath unto me, ne I kan think non other bot it is
so. And now yistre nyght my Lord Welles[119.1] come to Boston with
iiij^xx [_four score_] horses, and in the mornyng foloyng toke hym out
of prison, saying afore all peepll, 'Fals thefe, you shall be hanged,
and as mony of thy maistre men as may be goten' --as your servaunt John
Abbot kan report unto your gode Lordship,--and hath taken him away with
him to Tatessall, what to do with him I kan not say, bot as I suppose to
have him to Lincoln Castell: wherfor I besech your gode Lordship in this
matier to be my gode Lord, and it please your gode Lordship to write a
letter to the kepere of the Castell of Lincoln, that it liked him to
deliver him out of prison undre a sufficient seurety had for him, for
and thai may kepe him still be this meyne, thai may take all the
servaunts that I have, and so I may do agayn in like wise.

And also, as I am enformed, without he be had out of prison in hast,
it will be right gravewis to him to heile of his hurt, he is so sore
streken; and if there be any service that your gode Lordship will
comaund me to do in any cuntre, plesid you to send me word, and it shal
be done to my power with the grace of God, which have you, my right
honorabull and wurshipfull Lord, alway in his blessid kepyng. Writen at
Kyme,[119.2] upon Wednesday next after our Ladi day the
Assumpcion.[119.3]

Also plesid your gode lordship to wit, after this letter was made, there
come a man fro Tatessall into my fenne, which owght me gode will, and be
cause he wold not be holden suspect, he speke with wemen which were
mylkand kyne, and bad theme goo to a preest of myn to Dokdike, and bid
him fast goo gif me warnyng how that my Lord Wilughby,[120.1] my Lord
Cromwell,[120.2] and my Lord Welles[120.3] proposid theme to set a
sessions, and hang the said William Shirref, and thai myght bryng ther
entent abowte; and so, as I and your servaunt John Abbot stode to geder,
the prest come and gaf me warnyng herof, which I trust for my worship
your gode Lordship wold not shuld happen, for it wer to me the grettest
shame that myght falle; bot and it plese your gode Lordship to write to
all your servaunts in this cuntre, that thai will be redy upon a day
warnyng to come when I send theme word, I trust to God thai shal not
hang him agayn the lawe, bot I, with help of your gode Lordship, shall
be abull to let hit.

    [Footnote 118.2: [From Fenn, iii. 282.] This letter is dated by
    Fenn between 1455 and 1460, but cannot be later than the former
    of these years, as Lord Cromwell died in the beginning of 1456.
    It seems, further, beyond a doubt that the Lord Willoughby,
    mentioned along with him, was Robert, Lord Willoughby of Eresby,
    who was connected by marriage both with Lord Cromwell and with
    Lord Welles; and if so the date cannot be later than 1451, as
    this Lord Willoughby died in July 1452. Indeed, I have very
    little doubt it is before 1450, as both Tailboys and Beaumont
    were of the Duke of Suffolk's party, and it is not likely that
    the former would have ventured to complain of his powerful
    neighbours, Lords Willoughby, Cromwell, and Welles after the
    Duke's fall, especially as we know that in the beginning of 1450
    he was in prison for an attempt to murder Lord Cromwell.]

MARGARET PASTON TO JOHN PASTON[130.1]

_To my rytz wurchipful mayster, Jon Paston, be this delyvered in hast._

[Sidenote: 1450 / FEB. 21]

Ryt wurchipful hosband, I recommawnd me to zu, desyryng hertyly to heryn
of zour wele fare, preying zu to weten that I commawndyd Herry Goneld to
gon to Gunnore to have copys of the pleyntes in the hundrede, and
Gunnore was not at home; but the seyd Herry spake with his clerk, and he
told hym pleynly he wost wele his mayster wuld not late hym have no
copys, thow he wor at home, tyl the nexst hundred; qher for I send zou
that byl that was wownd abowt the relefys. Custans, Mak, and Kentyng
wold adysavowyd here swtes rytz fayn the last hundred, as I herd sayn of
rytz thryfty men; but the Lord Moleynys men thrett hem that bothe they
xuld ben betyn and lesen here hows and lond and alle here goods, but if
[_unless_] they wold avow it; and after that Osborn was gon,
Hasard[130.2] intretyd Kentyng and Mak to avow the swtys after that they
hadde disavowyd itt, and zave hem mony to zef to the clerkes to entren
azen the pleyntes. But if[130.3] ze seke a remedy in hast for to remeve
itt, I soppose they wyl distreyn for the mersymentes er the nexst
hundred.

As for Mak, he gate respyt that he xuld not sew tyl the nexst hundred.
As for Herry Goneld, he was dystreynyd zysterday for rent and ferm, and
he must pay it to morue, xxij_s._, or elles lesyn his dystresse. They
gadder mony fast of all the tenawntes. All the tenawntes ben chargyd to
pay al her rent and ferm be Fastyngong Sonday.[131.1] It ys told me that
the Lord Moleynys xuld kepe his Fastyngong att Jon Wynters plase.

The seid Lordes men haddyn a letter on Thursday last past; qhat tydyngs
they hadde I wote nott; but on the nexst moruenyng be tymys Thomas
Bampton, a man of the Lord Moleynys, rod with a letter to his lord, and
they that ben at Gressam waytyn after an answer of the letter in hast.
Barow, and Hegon, and all the Lord Moleynys men that wer at Gressam qhan
ze departyd hens bene there styll, save Bampton, and in his stede is kom
another; and I here sey thei xul abyd here styll tyl her lord kom
. . . .[131.2] to Barow as ze komawndyd me to weten quhatt the cawse was
that thei thrett men . . . .[131.2] Goneld and other of zour servawnts
and wele willers to zow, the qheche wer namyd to hym that were
thrett. . . . .[131.2] [s]wore pleynly that they were never thrett; but
I know veryly the contrary, for of his owyn felaschep lay[d] in awayt
sondery dayis and nytis abowt Gunnelds, Purrys, and Bekks plasis, and
som of them zedyn in to Bekks and Purrys [ho]usys, bothen in the hallys
and the bernys, and askyd qher thei were, and thei were answeryd that
they were owth; and thei seydyn azen that they xuld meten with hem
another tyme. And be dyvers other thyngs I know, if thei mytz aben kawt,
other [_either_] they xuld aben slayn or sor hurt.

I sent Kateryn on this forseyd masage, for I kowd geten no man to do it,
and sent with her Jamys Halman and Herry Holt; and sche desyryd of Barow
to have an answer of her masage, and if these forseyd men mytz levyn in
pese for hem, and seyd ther xuld elles ben purveyd other remedy for hem.
And he made her grett chere, and hem that wer ther with her, and seyd
that he desyryd for to spekyn with me, if it xuld ben non displesans to
me; and Kateryn seyd to hym that sche supposyd that I desyryd not to
speken with hym. And he seyd he xuld com forby this plase on huntyng
after non, and ther xuld no mor com with hym but Hegon and on of his
owyn men; and than he wold bryng seche an answere as xuld plese me. And
after none they come hydder, and sent in to me to weten if thei mytz
speken with me, and praying that thei mytz speken with me, and they
abedyn styl with owtz the zatys; and I kam owth to hem, and spak with
hem with owt, and prayid hem that thei wold hold me exkusyd that I
browth hem not in to the plase. I seyd in as meche as thei wer nott wele
wyllyng to the gode man of the plase, I wold not take it up on me to
bryng hem in to the jantylwoman. They seyd I dede the best, and than we
welk forthe, and desyryd an answer of hem for that I hadde sent to hem
for. Thei sayd to me thei had browtz me seche an answer as thei hopyd
xuld plese me, and told me how thei had comownd with all her felaschep
of soche materis as I had sent to hem fore, and that thei durst under
take that ther xud no man ben hurt of hem thatt wer rehersyd, ner no man
that longeth to zu, nother for hem ner non of her felaschep, and that
they answeryd me be her trowthis. Never lese I trest not to her promese,
in as meche as I fend hem ontrew in other thyngs.

I conseyvyd wele be hem that they wer wery of that thei haden don. Barow
swor to me be his trowth that he had lever than xl_s._, and xl. that his
lord had not comawndyd hym to com to Gressam; and he seyd he was rytz
sory hidderward, in as meche as he had knowleche of zw before, he was
rytz sory of that that was don. I seyd to hym that he xuld have
compascion on zu and other that wer disseysyd of her lyvelode, in as
meche as he had ben dissesyd hym self; and he seyd he was so, and told
me that he had sewyd to my Lord of Suffolk dyvers tymys, and wold don
tyl he may gete his gode azen. I seyd to hym that ze had sewyd to my
Lord Moleynys dyvers tymys for the maner of Gressam syth ze wer
dissesyd, and ze cowd never gete no resonabyl answer of hym; and ther
fore ze entred azen, as ye hopid that was for the best. And he seyd he
xuld never blame my Lord of Suffolk for the entre in his lyvelode, for
he seyd my seyd lord was sett ther up on be the informacion of a fals
schrew; and I seyd to hym in lyke wyse is the matier be twyx the Lord
Moleynys and zu. I told hym I wost wele he sett never ther upon be no
tytyl of rytz that he hadde to the maner of Gressam, but only be the
informacion of a fals schrew.[133.1] I rehersyd no name, but me thowt be
hem that thei wost ho I ment. Meche other langage we hadde, qhyche xuld
taken long leysyr in wrytyng. I rehersyd to hem that it xuld abe seyd
thatt I xuld not longe dwell so ner hem as I dewe and they for swer it,
as thei do other thyngs more that it was never seyd, and meche thyngs
that I know veryly was seyd.

I here seyn that ze and Jon of Damme ben sore thrett alway, and seyn
thow ze ben at London, ze xul ben met with ther as wele as thow ze were
her; and ther for I pray zu hertyly be ware how ze walk ther, and have a
gode felaschep with zu qhan ze xul walk owt. The Lord Moleynys hathe a
cumpany of brothell with hym that rekk not qhat they don, and seche ar
most for to drede. Thei that ben at Gressam seyn that they have not don
so moche hurte to zu as thei were commawndyd to don. Rabert Lauerawns is
wele amendyd, and I hope xall recure. He seyth pleynly he wyl compleyn
of his hurt, and I soppose Bek wyl compleyn also, as he hath cause. Bek
and Purry dare not abyd att hom tyl thei here other tydyngs. I wold not
Jon of Damme xuld com hom tyl the cuntre be storyd otherwyse than it is.
I pray Godde grawnt that it mot sone ben otherwyse than it is. I pray zu
hertyly that ze wil send me word how ze don, and how ze spede in zour
materis, for be my trowth I kan not ben wel att ese in my hert, ner not
xal ben tyl I here tydynges how ze don. The most part of zour stuff that
was at Gressam is sold, and zovyn away. Barow and his felaw spak to me
in the most plesawnt wyse, and me semyth be hem thei wold fayn plese me.
Thei seyd thei wold do me servyse and plesans, if it lay in her powres
to don owth for me, save only in that that longeth to her lordes rytz.
I seyd to hem, as for seche servys as they had do to zw and to me,
I desyr no mor that thei xuld do nother to zw ner to me. Thei seyd I myt
an had of them att Gressham qhat I hadde desyryd of hem, and had as
moche as I desyryd. I seyd, nay; if I mytz an had my desyr, I xuld
nother a departid owth of the place, ner from the stuff that was ther
in. Thei seyd, as for the stuff it was but esy. I seyd ze wold not a
zoven the stuff that was in the place qhan thei com in, not for C_li._
Thei seyd the stuff that thei sey [saw] ther was skars worth xx_li._ As
for zour moder and myn, sche faryth wel, blissid be God, and she had no
tydynges but gode zett, blissid be God. The blissyd Trynyte have zou in
his kepyng, and send zou hele, and gode spede in al your maters. Wretyn

ABSTRACT[134.2]

SIR JOHN FASTOLF TO SIR THOMAS HOWYS, CLERK, WILLIAM COLE, AND WATKYN
SHIPDAM.

[Sidenote: 1450 / MARCH 7]

The beginning of this letter, which is more than half lost by
mutilation, speaks of 'a bill in the Parliament of the extortions done
[to me]' from the 17th year [of Henry VI.] hitherto. The rest seems to
be partly memoranda of things to be entered in this 'bill,' viz. of
sheep distrained at Drayton, of a matter of trespass between Lady
Bardolf and Fastolf, of 'Chevers mater in Blyclyng,' of an unpaid
annuity at Hiklyng, of decays at Tichewell, etc. They are to learn from
Nich. Bokkyng, to whom the L100 for Busshop was paid. Thinks two men
should occupy Castre and Wynterton which Broun holds alone. It is too
much for one to occupy well; 'and in the same wise at Heylesden and
Drayton.' Let me know what Lampet has done in my matter, and if you find
him friendly. Both my ships have arrived in safety, thank God.

London, 7 March 28 Henry VI.

ABSTRACT[140.2]

ELIZABETH CLERE TO JOHN PASTON.

[Sidenote: Year uncertain]

Stywardesson came to her on Easter even to church, and made a very
humble submission. He at first denied having slandered her, or said that
he was beaten, only that he was sore afraid; but at last acknowledged he
had untruly charged her men with coming into his place with force and
arms, and that he was beaten, for which his master took an action
against her. Called her tenants to bear witness to his recantation. Said
she would give him no answer now but by advice of her friends, and his
master must leave his maintenance. Promised him an answer on Saturday in
Easter week. He told another man that Heidon promised his master it
should be put in award by Palm Sunday; 'for he is double both to him and
to me, and so is William Geney and mo of my counsel.' He is willing to
make a release. His barn which his men entered to distrain, he says, is
frank, and he may give the rent when he pleases. Wishes Paston's advice
what answer to make.--Easter Monday.

Begs him to solicit the expedition of the matters of which he wrote
since Easter.--Debts of Thos. Symmys for rents and sale of wools not yet
paid to F. in Dedham.--As for the matter of Rydlyngfold and Hykele,
'seth it ys soo the world is changed gretely over it was, y pray you,
and charge you, parson, labour ye to my frendz Lampet and others' to get
a copy of their evidences; for 'howbeit the said prioress say that her
evidence be in the Duke of Suffolk's keeping or his counsel,' she had a
book in which all the evidence is copied. The thing would have been sped
long ere this, if 'my Lord Norwich['s] Chancellor' or Master Pope, had
labored as they promised. For God's sake send me a good answer. 'If an
inordinate book be made, remembering the deliverance' of cloths, &c.
into F.'s wardrobe, let the indentures be engrossed. Wonders Howys
cannot furnish him with a full account of the damages sustained by F.
and his tenants these ten or twelve years past. He has only sent a
declaration of costs in defending some of them. Get a letter of Nich.
Bokkyng of the L100 to whom it was paid.

    [Footnote 150.1: [From Fenn, i. 162.] This letter, which Fenn
    vaguely assigned to the latter part of the reign of Henry VI.,
    may be pretty safely attributed to the year 1450. The mention of
    Lord Rivers and the Duke of Suffolk could not have been earlier
    than 1449, as the one was only created lord, and the other duke
    in 1448, and at a later date than the 13th of May. The reference
    to the Duke of Suffolk again is not likely to have been long
    after his decease. Further, there is a strong presumption, from
    Monday being spoken of as a past date, and Friday as a future,
    that the letter was written on a Wednesday. Had it been on a
    Tuesday or Thursday, Monday would have been spoken of as
    'yesterday' or Friday as 'to-morrow.' Now, the 13th of May was a
    Wednesday in 1450. The changes in officers of state mentioned in
    this letter are, therefore, those consequent on the fall of the
    Duke of Suffolk. There is, besides, as will be seen by a
    foot-note, an allusion to the Parliament at Leicester.]

[Sidenote: Year uncertain]

Right trusty and right intierly welbeloved, we grete you hertly wele.
And it is so, as ye know wele your self, we haf and long tyme haf had
the service of Thomas Denyes, by continuance wherof we wend to haf had
his attendaunce at our lust; and nevertheless we haf so strictly
examynid his demenyng that we fele and pleynly conceyve that the love
and effeccion which he hath to a gentilwoman not ferre from yow, and
which ye be privy to, as we suppose, causith hym alwey to desire toward
your cuntre, rather than toward suych ocupacion as is behovefull to us.
We write therfore to yow, prayng yow hertly as ye love us, that it like
you to do that labour at our instaunce be suych men [_mean_] as your
wisdom can seme, to meve that gentilwoman in our behalf for the wele of
this mater, undirtakyng for us that we wole shew our bounte to thaym
bothe, if it plese hir that this mater take effect, so that be reason
she shall haf cause to take it in gree. And if the comyng thider of our
persone self shuld be to plesir of hir, we wole not leve our labour in
that: wherfore we pray you that ye wole do your part heryn, as ye wole
we do for yow in tyme comyng, and that ye se us in hast. The Holy
Trinite kepe yow. Wretyn at Wevenho, the xvij. day of May.

    [Footnote 151.1: [From Fenn, iii. 360.] This letter cannot well
    be of the same year as the last, but is probably not many years
    earlier, and certainly not many years later. The reasons against
    its being of the same year are--first, that it seems to be
    implied in the letter preceding that the Earl of Oxford was at
    Winch, near Lynn, in Norfolk, on the 13th May 1450, which makes
    it improbable that he would be at Wivenhoe in Essex four days
    after; and, secondly, that he is not likely to have offered to
    go into Norfolk (especially after having just come out of
    Norfolk) on a matter touching the private affairs of one of his
    own adherents, when he declined to go to the Parliament at
    Leicester.]

J. PAYN TO JOHN PASTON[153.1]

_To my ryght honurabyll maister, John Paston._

[Sidenote: 1450 (written in 1465)]

Ryght honurabyll and my ryght enterly bylovyd maister, I recomaunde me
un to yow, with al maner of due reverence, in the moste louly wyse as we
ought to do, evermor desyryng to here of your worshipfull state,
prosperite, and welfar; the which I beseke God of his aboundant grace
encrece and mayntene to his moste plesaunce, and to your hartis dssyre.

Pleasyth it your gode and gracios maistershipp tendyrly to consedir the
grete losses and hurts that your por peticioner haeth, and haeth jhad
evyr seth the comons of Kent come to the Blakheth,[153.2] and that is at
xv. yer passed, whereas my maister Syr John Fastolf, Knyght, that is
youre testator,[153.3] commandyt your besecher to take a man, and ij. of
the beste orsse that wer in his stabyll, with hym to ryde to the comens
of Kent, to gete the articles that they come for. And so I dyd; and al
so sone as I come to the Blakheth, the capteyn[153.4] made the comens to
take me. And for the savacion of my maisters horse, I made my fellowe to
ryde a wey with the ij. horses; and I was brought forth with befor the
capteyn of Kent. And the capteyn demaundit me what was my cause of
comyng thedyr, and why that I made my fellowe to stele a wey with the
horse. And I seyd that I come thedyr to chere with my wyves brethren,
and other that were my alys and gossippes of myn that were present
there. And than was there oone there, and seid to the capteyn that I was
one of Syr John Fastolfes men, and the ij. horse were Syr John
Fastolfes; and then the capteyn lete cry treson upon me thorought all
the felde, and brought me at iiij. partes of the feld with a harrawd of
the Duke of Exetter[154.1] before me in the dukes cote of armes, makyng
iiij. _Oyes_ at iiij. partes of the feld; proclaymyng opynly by the seid
harrawd that I was sent thedyr for to espy theyre pusaunce, and theyre
abyllyments of werr, fro the grettyst traytor that was in Yngelond or in
Fraunce, as the seyd capteyn made proclaymacion at that tyme, fro oone
Syr John Fastolf, Knyght, the whech mynnysshed all the garrisons of
Normaundy, and Manns, and Mayn, the whech was the cause of the lesyng of
all the Kyngs tytyll and ryght of an herytaunce that he had by yonde
see. And morovyr he seid that the seid Sir John Fastolf had furnysshyd
his plase[154.2] with the olde sawdyors of Normaundy and abyllyments of
werr, to destroy the comens of Kent whan that they come to Southewerk;
and therfor he seyd playnly that I shulde lese my hede.

And so furthewith I was taken, and led to the capteyns tent, and j. ax
and j. blok was brought forth to have smetyn of myn hede; and than my
maister Ponyngs, your brodyr,[154.3] with other of my frendes, come and
lettyd the capteyn, and seyd pleynly that there shulde dye a C. or ij.
[_a hundred or two_], that in case be that I dyed; and so by that meane
my lyf was savyd at that tyme. And than I was sworen to the capteyn, and
to the comens, that I shulde go to Southewerk, and aray me in the best
wyse that I coude, and come ageyn to hem to helpe hem; and so I gote
th'articles, and brought hem to my maister, and that cost me more emongs
the comens that day than xxvij_s._

Wherupon I come to my maister Fastolf, and brought hym th'articles, and
enformed hym of all the mater, and counseyled hym to put a wey all his
abyllyments of werr and the olde sawdiors; and so he dyd, and went
hymself to the Tour, and all his meyny with hym but Betts and j. [_i.e._
one] Mathew Brayn; and had not I ben, the comens wolde have brennyd his
plase and all his tennuryes, wher thorough it cost me of my noune propr
godes at that tyme more than vj. merks in mate and drynke; and nought
withstondyng the capteyn that same tyme lete take me atte Whyte Harte in
Suthewerk, and there comandyt Lovelase to dispoyle me oute of myn aray,
and so he dyd. And there he toke a fyn gowne of muster dewyllers[155.1]
furryd with fyn bevers, and j. peyr of Bregandyrns[155.2] kevert with
blew fellewet [_velvet_] and gylt naile, with legharneyse, the vallew of
the gown and the bregardyns viij_li._

Item, the capteyn sent certeyn of his meyny to my chamber in your rents,
and there breke up my chest, and toke awey j. obligacion of myn that was
due unto me of xxxvj_li._ by a prest of Poules, and j. nother obligacion
of j. knyght of x_li._, and my purse with v. ryngs of golde, and
xvij_s._ vj_d._ of golde and sylver; and j. herneyse [_harness_]
complete of the touche of Milleyn;[155.3] and j. gowne of fyn
perse[155.4] blewe furryd with martens; and ij. gounes, one furryd with
bogey,[155.5] and j. nother lyned with fryse;[155.6] and ther wolde have
smetyn of myn hede, whan that they had dyspoyled me atte White Hart. And
there my Maister Ponyngs and my frends savyd me, and so I was put up
tyll at nyght that the batayle was at London Brygge;[155.7] and than
atte nyght the capteyn put me oute into the batayle atte Brygge, and
there I was woundyt, and hurt nere hand to deth; and there I was vj.
oures in the batayle, and myght nevyr come oute therof; and iiij. tymes
before that tyme I was caryd abought thorought Kent and Sousex, and ther
they wolde have smetyn of my hede.

And in Kent there as my wyfe dwellyd, they toke awey all oure godes
mevabyll that we had, and there wolde have hongyd my wyfe and v. of my
chyldren, and lefte her no more gode but her kyrtyll and her smook. And
a none aftyr that hurlyng, the Bysshop Roffe[156.1] apechyd me to the
Quene, and so I was arestyd by the Quenes commaundment in to the
Marchalsy, and there was in rygt grete durasse, and fere of myn lyf, and
was thretenyd to have ben hongyd, drawen, and quarteryd; and so wold
have made me to have pechyd my Maister Fastolf of treson. And by cause
that I wolde not, they had me up to Westminster, and there wolde have
sent me to the gole house at Wyndsor; but my wyves and j. coseyn of myn
noune that were yomen of the Croune, they went to the Kyng, and got
grase and j. chartyr of pardon.

ABSTRACT[159.3]

JAMES GRESHAM TO [JOHN PASTON?].

[Sidenote: About 1450]

Inquiry made as to the injury of Sporle wood for lack of hedging. The
three years' growth of the wood availeth no man. The farmers now cannot
sell it the better, so it must be either to your hurt or Halman's. Hopes
the wastes at Cressingham will be amended. Your tenants are treated
unfairly about the Sheriff's turn by those of the Prior of Norwich and
John Coo. Can get no money, for Fulchier hopes he is not so far in
arrear as you think. Halman can get no money; his corns are so cheap he
will not sell, but he hopes to make purveyance at Michaelmas.

Calybut says he never asked the Vicar of Sporle to be bound for him.
They will meet with me at Gressenhale on St. Bartholomew's day and seal
the other part, so that they have notice from you at Swaffham Market,
Saturday next before.

Ryght worthy worshipfull sir, and myn especiall maister, I recomaund

that ye hadde sued to hym for an especiall assise[161.2] and an _oier_
and _determiner_,[161.3] [and][161.1] . . . . .[161.1] that he shuld
comaunde his men beyng at Gresham to departe thens, and that the
profitez thereof shuld be receyved by an endifferent [person][161.1]
. .[161.1] saufly to be kepte til the right were determyned be twen yow

of my Lord Chaunceller to the Lord Moleyns. And he sent his answer in

laboured in his cuntre to peas and stille the poeple[161.4] there to
restreyngne them from rysyng, and so he was dayly laboured there abowt
in the Kynggs servyce, and that considered, he trustid veryly that there
shuld non assise be graunted to your entent. And he seid forther in his
answer, if he myght attende to be in Norffolk, and leve the necessary
servyce that he dede to the Kyng now in Wyltshire, he wolde be but weel
pleased that ye hadde your assise; for he knewe his title and his
evydence so good for his part, that he durst weel putte it in my Lord
Chaunceller, and in what juge he wolde calle to hym. And wher my Lord
Chaunceller desired hym to avoyde his men from Gresham, he trustid that
my Lord wolde not desire that, by cause he hadde his possession, and
that it was his wyffs ryght, and so hym thought it a geynst reason that
he shuld a voide utterly his possession.

This same Moneday goth my Lord Chaunceller and my Lord of Buk[161.5]
into Kent to sytte up on an _oier_ and _determyner_[161.6] at
Rorchestre; and Whyte told me that there is wretyn an generall _oier_
and _determyner_ to be in Norffolk, and what ther[fore][162.1] and for
the Lord Moleyns writyng, hym semyth it is not to your avayll to sewe
for an especiall assise, ne for an _oier_ and _determyner_.

Whan I come hiddirward, I mette with my Lord of Norffolk betwen Berkewey
and Baburgham homward, and whethir he shall come agayn hiddir or noght I
wot not, but I trowe rather yes thanne nay; for it is seid that alle the
Lords be sent for to be here on Moneday or Tuysday next comyng for a
counseyll.

The Chief Justice[162.2] is not here, ne noon other Justice, except
Danvers[162.3] is now made Juge of the Comune Place, and is forth into
Kent with the Lords, &c.

Al this tofore was wretyn on the Moneday next after our Lady day. And
this same Wednesseday was it told that Shirburgh[162.4] is goon, and we
have not now a foote of londe in Normandie, and men arn ferd that Calese
wole be beseged hastily, &c.

Pynchamour shall telle yow by mowthe more thanne I have leyser to write
now to yow. I wrot to myn em'[162.5] that there were ix. or x. m^l.
[_nine or ten thousand_] men up in Wiltshire, and I hadde it of the

    [Footnote 163.1: [Douce MS. 393, f. 88.] From the similarity of
    the contents of this and the two following letters, it is
    evident that they belong to the same year; and the mention of
    Thomas Denyes, from whom the Earl of Oxford was afterwards
    estranged, proves that it must have been before 1454. In the
    summer of 1450, there was disaffection in Norfolk, which led to
    the issuing of a special commission of _oyer and terminer_ in
    September. These three letters may, therefore, have belonged to
    that year.]

    [Footnote 163.2: 'This shire' should be Suffolk, as the Earl
    dates from Bury St. Edmunds, but I should think Norfolk was

    [Footnote 164.1: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] The two letters
    following are from contemporaneous copies written on the same
    paper. Being dated the same day as the preceding letter of the
    Earl of Oxford, and addressed to the two persons named in the
    postscript, we should have every reason to suppose they are the
    copies there mentioned, were it not for the circumstance that
    the Earl of Oxford's seat at Wynche, near Lynn, in Norfolk, must
    have been a good day's journey from Bury St. Edmunds. The
    internal evidence, however, is in other respects so strong that
    we have no doubt at all upon the subject. The difficulty as to
    the date may be accounted for by supposing that these two
    letters were really written at Wynche the day before, but that
    the date 21st August was filled in by the Earl at Bury St.
    Edmunds at the time he despatched his letter of the same date to
    John Paston.]

JOHN PASTON TO JAMES GRESHAM[168.1]

_The copie of the letter of J. P._

[Sidenote: 1450 / SEPT. 4]

James Gresham, I prey yow laboure forth to have answer of my bille for
myn especial assise, and the oyer and termyner,[168.2] accordyng to my
seid bille that I delyvered to my Lord Chaunceler,[168.3] letyng hym
wete that his Lordship conceyved the graunt of suyche a special matier
myght cause a rumour in the cuntre. Owt of dowte the cuntre is not so
disposed, for it is desired ageyn suche persones as the c[untre] wolde
were ponysshid; and if they be not ponysshid to refourme that they have
do amysse, by liklynesse the cuntre wole rise up on th[em]. Men talke
that a general oier and termyner is graunted to the Duke of Norfolk, my
Lord of Ely, the Erll of Oxenford, the Lord Scales, Sir John Fastolf,
Sir Thomas Fulthorp, and William Yelverton, and men be right glad
therof. Yet that notwithstondyng, laboure ye forth for me. F[or] in a
general oyer and termyner a _supersedeas_ may dassh al, and so shall not
in a special. And also if the justicez come at my request, they shall
sytte als long as I wole, and so shall thei not by the generall. And as
for commyssioners in myn, &c., Sir John Fastolf must be pleyntyf als
weel as I my self, and so he may not be commyssioner; and as for alle
the remenant, I can thynke them indifferent inow in the matier, except
my Lord Scales, whos wyff is aunte to the Lady Moleyns.

And as for that the Lord Moleyns hath wretyn that he dar put the matier
in awarde of my Lord Chaunceler, and in what juge he wole take to hym,
&c. (which offre as I suppose shall be tolde to yow for to make yow to
cesse your labour), thanne lete that be answerid, and my Lord
Chaunceller enfourmed thus: The matier was in trete by th'assent of the
Lord Moleyns a twene his counseil and myn, whiche assembled at London
xvj. dyvers dayes, and for the more part there was a sergeant and vj.
or vij. thrifty apprentisez; at whiche tyme the Lord Moleyns title was
shewed, and clerly answerid, in so meche that his own counseil seide
they cowde no forther in the matier, desiryng me to ride to Salesbury to
the Lord Moleyns, promyttyng of their part that thei wolde moeve the
Lord Moleyns, so that thei trusted I shuld have myn entent or I come
thens; of whiche title and answer I send yow a copie that hath be put in
to the Parlement, the Lord Moleyns being there present, whereto he cowde
not sey nay. Also by fore this tyme I have agreed to put it in ij.
juges, so thei wolde determyne by our evydences the right, moevyng
nother partie to yeve other by ony mene, but only the right determyned,
he to be fully recompensed that hath right. Whereto he wold not agree,
but alle tymes wolde that thoe juges shulde entrete the parties as they
myght be drawe to by offre and profre to my conceyte as men bye hors.
Whiche matiers considerid, my counseil hath alwey conceyved that the
tretees he offred hath be to non othir entent but to delaye the matier,
or ellis to entrete me to relese my damages, for title hath he non. And
he knowith weel the title shall never better be undirstond thanne it
hath be by his counseil and myn atte seid comunycacions. And also my
Lord Chaunceler undirstond that the Lord Moleyns men toke and bar away
more than cc_li._ [L200] worth of my goodes and catalles. Wherof I
delyvered hym a bylle of every parcell, wherto al the world knoweth he
canne make no title. And if he were disposed to do right, my counseil
thynketh he shuld restore that, for therfor nedith nowthir comunycacion
nor trete. And with owt he wole restore that, I trowe no man can thynk
that his trete is to no good purpose.

I preye yow hertily laboure ye so to my Lord Chaunceller that owther he
wole graunte me my desire, or ellis that he wole denye it. And lete me
have answer from yow in wrytyng how ye spede. If my Lord Chaunceler hath
lost my bille that I delyvered hym, wherof I sende yowe a copie, that
thanne ye put up to hym an othir of the same, takyng a copie to your
self.

Recomand me to my cosyn William Whyte,[170.1] and prey hym to gyf yow
his help in this, and lete hym be prevye to this letter. And lete hym
w[ete] that my cosyn his suster hath childe, a doughter. Wretyn at
Norwich, the iiij. day of Septembre.

Dyverse men of my freendis avyse me to entre in to the maner of Gresham
by force of my writte of restitution, whiche I wole not do by cause the
maner is so decayed by the Lord Moleyns occupacion, that where it was
worth to me l. marks clerly by yeer, I cowde not now make it worth
xx_li._; for whiche hurt, and for othir hurtis, by this special assise I
trust to have remedye.

done to him by divers men in Norfolk, of part of which he sent a roll to
them at Castre a month ago. Sends John Bokkyng for an answer. Was often
damaged by the Duke of Suffolk's officers in Lodylond, both by undue
amerciaments and distraining cattle at Cotton, and by the officers of
Cossey, of which there should be remembrances at Castre. Wrote also that

Has received his letter by Thomas Fastolf touching his diligence about
the recovery of the letter with the Bishop of Norwich, and of the
evidences of Rydlyngfeld, with a copy of a certain indenture which F.
has already sealed. Has no answer of the correction of the articles F.
sent home to him two months ago. As my Lord of Norfolk is at Norwich to
sit upon the oyer and terminer, you must labor to shew forth my
grievances. Nothing can be done till after Michaelmas about the _venire
facias_ for the jury of Sybton. Has written this week by the Parson of
Estharlyng to Berney, who, he hears, has been shewing favor to his
adversaries. Refers him further to John Bokkyng, who is now in Norfolk.

ABSTRACT[172.1]

THE VICAR OF SPORLE TO JOHN PASTON.

[Sidenote: 1450(?) / SEPT. 29]

Reports the disposition of 'my master,' the Provost. Francis Costard
brought his evidence to my master's presence, where it was examined. He
wondered what title you would claim to the land. I said, men said it was
once free till it was soiled by a bondman. He gave more weight to the
evidence of John Aleyn and Nicholas Waterman. Aleyn says he was steward
of the manor, in Garleke's days, forty years, and never knew it claimed
for bond ground; and the said Nicholas says it was he who moved your
father to buy the manor. Many others have set their seals to corroborate
this. Asked him to be good unto Henry Halman, who was amerced in his
court for chastising a servant of his, a bondman of yours. My master

_To my maister Paston in hast._

[Sidenote: 1450 / OCT. 4]

Right worshipfull and my right good maister, I recomaund me to you. And
like you wete that it is now . . . . I haf for Danyels sake put my self
withynne the maner of Rydon; and her is with me a kynnesman [of] my
mastres your wifes, John Bendyssh. And as yestirday cam John Wodehous
with a xij. hors to Geyt[on]; on the othre side cometh Fitz William with
xx. hors; and on the third parte, oon Hoberd of Midelton hath redy a xx.
felaws; and on the fourth parte, stant the toune of Lynne redy with
Herry Wodehous; and thei all be gon thedir this nyght. This day folwyng
cometh to thaym Herry Tudenham, William Narburgh, Thomas Trusbut, Thomas
Kervile, and Shuldham servauntez, Salesbury and William Owayn. It is so
that of my lorde[173.2] gete I no socour, and lever I had to dy than gif
up the place sith I am ther yn. And I wene if thei gete the place upon
me ther helpith my lif no pardon. Wherfore I lowly beseche yow, maister
Paston, advertise in your wisdom that this was the first porpose of
Tudenham and Heydon whils thei regned, to gete this place; and to that
intent thei brought hider the lord Roos, which now is full simpely
thought on with my maister that I serve. And ye wete wele that I have
most encountred the entent of Tudenham and Heydon of ony pouer man on
lyve; And if I be lost or put to an ungoodly rebuke heryn my service is
the lesse of valu to you that be gentils of the shire. Wherfore I
requyre your maistership to come hider in your persone with suych as ye
seme not to that intent to take party in the mater, but to that intent
to help to set peas in the shire, and to stire my lord for his honour.
For yisterday my lord sent to Lynne and made a cry to be made that he
wold be named in the writ of the statute of Northampton, and that cry
hath caused the common pople of the toun of Lynne to stere the more.
Neverthelesse all the substaunce of the toun is in peas and peasid by
the wisdam of the Meir theer, but not for than sum of thaym come with
Harry Wodehous, so that I deme he hath a vj^xx. persones in all on all
sides. I beseche you to send me hider sum socour beside forth, with John
Osbern and John Lister with thaym, and come ye aftir a parte by your
good wisdome soukyng (_sic_) their demenynges, and send me your advyse.
Wretyn the nyght of the Sunday a forn seynt Feithesday.

  Your servaunt,

  THOMAS DENYES.

This day I deme thei come beforn us. If ye help not now, Tudenham and
Heydon shal achieve in their desese the conquest that thei coude never
achieve in their prosperite.

of York shuld wryte un to hese tenance that they wold suffyr Peny Cocks
officers go and gader up hys rents fermes with inne the seyd Dukes

Sir Borle Jonge and Josse labour sore for Heydon and Tudenham to Sir

JAMES GRESHAM TO JOHN PASTON[180.2]

_To my worshipfull Maister Paston, at Norwich, in haste, be this
delyvered._

[Sidenote: 1450 / [OCT.]]

Please it yow to wete that I come to London the Wednesseday at even late
next after my departyng from yow, and it was told me that my Maister
Calthorp hadde writyng fro my Lord of York to awayte on hym at his
comyng in to Norffolk to be oon of his men, and that no gentilman of
Norffolk had writyng to awayte on hym but he; and sum folke wene that it
is to th'entent that he shuld bo outhir shiref or knyght of the shire,
to the fortheryng of othir folks, &c.

The Kyng is remevid from Westminster, summe men sey to Fysshwick,[181.1]
and summe sey to Bristowe. And it is seid that he hath do wretyn to alle
his men that be in the chekroll[181.2] to awayte on hym atte Parlement
in their best aray; why, no man can telle. Heydon[181.3] was with my
Maister Yelverton,[181.4] and desired hym to see the recordes of his
endytementz, and axed of hym if he were indited of felonye; and my
Maister Yelverton told hym it was. And thereto H. seide 'Sir, ye wole
recorde that I was never thef;' and he seid he trowed right weel that he
cowde telle why he took Plumpsteds goods, and othir words whiche were
long to write. And my Maister Y. seid to hym he cowde not knowe the
laborer of th'endytement, and H. seid ageyn he knewe weel the laborer
thereof; and my Maister Y. conceyte is H. ment yow. Wherfor he advyseth
yow that in onywyse ye make Plumpsted to take apell accordyng; for if he
so do, thanne is H. barred of his conspirace, and also of his damages,
though that he be nonnsewed therin, or though it be afterward
discontynued, &c., and ellis are ye in jopardy of a conspirace, for H.
hopeth to have the world better to his entent thanne it is nowe. For it
is told me that rather thanne he shuld fayle of a shiref this yeer
comyng for his entent, he wole spende m^{l.}_li._ [L1000].

This communicacion be twene them was on Moneday last passed, and on
Tewisday last passed H. mette with Maister Markham,[181.5] and he tolde
H. his part how that he levid ungoodly in puttyng awey of his wyff, and
kept an other, &c.; and therwith he turned pale colour, and seid he
lyved not but as God was pleased with, ne dede no wrong to no person.
And therupon Maister Markham reherced how he demened hym a genst men of
Court, and named yow and Genneye; and H. seid, as touchyng the peple
that rifled yow, and the doyng thereof, he was not privy therto, for he
was that tyme here at London; and as touchyng the Lord Moleyns title, H.
enforced gretly, and seid his title was better thanne yours.

Yisterday was my Maister Yelverton at dyner with my Maister
Fastolf,[182.1] and there among other thei were avysed that my Maister
F. shall write to my Lord of Norffolk that he certifie the Kyng and his
Counseill how the cuntre of N. and S. [_Norfolk and Suffolk_] stonde
right wildely, withowt a mene may be that justice be hadde, whiche wole
not be but if a man of gret byrthe and lyflod there be shiref thes yer
comyng, to lede the peple in most peas; and therto thei named Maister
Stapilton,[182.2] if it wole happe, &c. Also that my Lord Norffolk shall
certifie the Kyng and his Counseill that but if the day of the oyer and
termyner stonde, it wole be full harde, by cause the peple is so wylde.

Also that alle knyghtes and escuyers of the same cuntre shuld certifie
the same, for summe of H. part have boosted that all . . . . at Norwich
shuld not be worth an haughe. _Ideo_, &c.

Item, Prentise is now in the Mydle Inne, and Dynne . . . . .

Almyghty God have yow in his kepyng. Wretyn the Thursday next after my
departyng. . . . .

  Your,

[Sidenote: 1450]

After that myn letter was wretyn, I spak with Maister Yelverton, and
tolde hym the substance of my letter to yow. And he bad me write to yow
that as touchyng the matier of my Lord of Oxeford, he shall lette the
awardyng and th'entre therof als long as he may; and he demyth veryly
that H. Wodehous coude never have take up on his knowelage to have
called up on the matier with owt counseil and enformacion of Heydon, and
it were weel do that my Lord of Oxeford knewe it.

Item, Maister Yelverton told me that the Lord Moleyns was enfourmed that
he and alle his men wern endited of felonye in Norffolk, whiche caused
hym and his to be right wroth toward my maister and yow. And Maister
Yelverton hath tolde a man of the Kyngges Benche called Styrop, whiche
is a man of the Lord Moleyns, the trouth that nothir he ner noon of his
is endited, and Stirop is now in to Wiltshire, and shall telle it to the
Lord M.; for that shall squage weel his hete of wrethe. And as touchyng
Germyn,[183.2] if he be Shiref, William Genney wole undirtake for hym
that he shall and wole be ruled weel inow, &c.

    which follows clearly refer to the same matter. The time of year
    and the part taken by the Duke of York in the election are
    circumstances which in themselves create a pretty strong
    presumption in favour of the year 1450. And this presumption
    almost becomes a certainty, when we observe that the date of
    this letter--16th October--was a Friday in that year; for the
    meeting of York and Norfolk is stated in the next letter to have
    been on a Thursday and Friday, and this letter would doubtless
    have been written as soon as a decision had been come to between
    the two Lords.]

ABSTRACT[188.1]

SIR JOHN FASTOLF TO SIR THOMAS HOWYS, PARSON OF CASTLECOMBE.

[Sidenote: 1450 / NOV. 11]

'Right trusty and welbeloved friends,' I thank you for the quittance of
Richard Sellyng you have sent me by Worcestre, with a quittance of
Fauconere for the purchase of Davyngton, and another of Roys for the
purchase of Tychewell. Ask my cousin Herry Sturmer's wife to search for
an indenture and other writings between me and Sellyng or Lady
Wiltshire. As you inform me that Sir Thomas Todenham has sent to John
Clerc to be at London, you must ask him and his wife to go before the
bailiffs of Yarmouth, and certify how it was Bysshop's wife did not
receive the L100 I was ruled to pay her. John Clerc must not come up
till I send for him.--(_In margin_, 'eyer and determiner.') Special
labour has been made that Justice Yelverton should not come down this
Martinmas, but the King and Lords have determined that he shall keep his
day; 'and the labour that ye, with my cousin Paston, made late to my
Lord Norfolk was right well avised, in case that the Justice should be
countermanded.' Urge my friends to do their very best for me now in the
matters 'labored last at the oyer and terminer,' that they may take a
worshipful end. Thank Nicholas Bokkyng for what he did about the
certificate of the jury in the office[188.2] of Tychewell, and beg him
to get it sealed in time, which will be a great evidence for the
recovery of my manor. Sends home some horses 'to be occupied in the
cart.' Commendations to his cousin John Berney.

  _Signed._

Send for William Cole about the accounts, and thank the Parson of
Haylesdon[189.1] for the three writings of Wiltshire's will and Gorney
he sent me by Worcester; but say I prayed him to search for more.

London, St. Martin's day.

  [This letter is dated on Martinmas day, at which date in the year
  1450 it will be seen by the preceding number that Justice Yelverton
  was going down into Norfolk, and an _oyer and terminer_ was going to
  be held at Norwich. The reference to the 'office,' or inquisition,
  of Tychewell also proves the year to be 1450. --_See_ Nos. 162 and

SIR JOHN FASTOLF TO SIR THOMAS, Pastor of Castlecombe, JOHN BOKKYNG, and
WATKIN SHYPDAM.

[Sidenote: 1450 / NOV. 23]

Thanks the Parson for a letter by Robert Botiller, and one by John
Clerc, advising that Bokking and William Jenney be 'in that parties'
betimes for the _oyer and terminer_. Has received instruction of the
first purchase of Haylysdon. Is glad John Clerc is come. Much strange
labour has been made to him by Tasborough and Swolle. Complains of the
untruth of Appulzerd of Norwich in the Lady Bardolf's matter. A bailly
of Hikelyng maintains the Prior in his wrong against Fastolf. William
Barker had a box of evidences of the farm of Lady Bardolf's lands, and a
deed of Norman's feoffment with evidences of Saxthorp, which cannot be
found here, and must have been left at Norwich or Castre. Don't forget
Norman's matter, and the maintainers of the false inquest of Beyton
Bradwell. Wyndham wants to be friends with me about the Lady Bardolf's
matter. The master of St. Giles has been with me for the purchase of
Mundham Maner with appurtenances in Cyselond, and I have agreed with him
for 200 marks. Don't forget the bailly of Hykelyng, who said I should
forge [_i.e._ had forged] evidence, &c.

SIR JOHN FASTOLF TO SIR THOMAS, Parson of Castlecombe, WILLIAM JENNEY,

[Sidenote: 1450 / DEC. 2]

Thanks them for their diligence. Has respited the matter against Wyndham
touching the Lady Bardolf till next term, as he offers to come to an
agreement.[192.3] Is ready to agree with all persons who will find
sufficient surety, except Sir Thomas Tudenham, Heydon, and _Pykering_
(_underlined_). Master John Botewright has sent him a letter of great
loss and damage done by Tudenham and Heydon to the 'comyn' of Swaffham,
'benymmyng (?) 600 acres lond of her comyn.' Has written to 'my brother
Yelverton,' and would write also to my Lord of Oxford, but that he is so
vexed in spirit 'in thys trouble seson,' that at times he cannot abide
the signing and sealing of a letter. Prays them to see well to the
accountants and auditors' charges.

London, 2 Dec. 29 Hen. VI.

'And because I might [not] abide till the writing of the matters that I
commanded Worcester to write, I signed the letter so near the beginning;
but I will ye tender, nevertheless, my letter and articles for my most
profit and avail.'

Memoranda signed by Sir John Fastolf (_mutilated at the head_) viz.
about the Prior of Hikelyng; that John Ulveston and John Andrew be
indicted for forging the office of Boyton, as well as for Bradwell in
Suffolk; Brayn to deliver copies; if they sit in Suffolk, to take heed
of Sypton's matter. Nicholas Apleyard will doubtless appear to the bill
of maintenance; so the Prior and Sacristan and Sir H. Inglose must be
'laboured' to give information. Process against Dynne, Prentis, &c.
Obligation of 200 marks that Brian Stapleton has in keeping. The Parson
of Castlecombe to speak with John Emond of Taverham secretly about one
who pretended title to Dedham, &c. 'That ready word come alway atwix
Norwich and this of the tidings that are there.' Matter of Margaret
Brygge, &c. 'That Paston conceive the crossed letter, and say therein to
my Lady Felbrigg.' To speak to Paston and Jenney about various matters.
To speak to Reppys 'that he feel my Lord Scales and the Prior of
Hikelyng jointly if they will yet treat, as my Lord Scales and my master
were agreed at London,' &c.

  [From the reference to Sypton's matter, it would appear that this

before the Kyngs Commyssioners attained; and I vele ryght well by the
avauncement of my processe your faithfull diligence, for whych y can you
ryght gode thank, and trustyng uppon your gode continuance. And seth the
Commissioners shall sytt at Lynne after the Epiphanye, such of my maters
as have take none ende, but hang yn processe for deffaut of aunsuer or
apparaunce of my partie, I pray you that the said maters may be called
uppon of the new, and dew processe had as ferre as justice and gode
concience wolle.

Item, it ys so, as I undrestand, that the Lord Scalys woll be at Lynne
thys Cristmasse, and at the oyer and terminer halden there, and Sir
Thomas Tuddenham and Heydon wolle appere, of which I am well content;
and it ys lyke that grete labour and speciall pursute shall be made to
the Lord Scalys that he wolle meynteyn the said Tuddenham and Heydon in
all he can or may, and thus I have herd sey. Wherfor such persones as
have founde hem soore greved by extorcion as I have ben, and have
processe or wolle hafe processe before the Commissioners, they most
effectuelly labour to my Lord Oxford, and to my brothyr Zelverton,
Justice, that they wolle as ferre as justice, reson, and concience do
that justice may [be] egallie mynistred, and not to wythdrawe theyr
couragez well sett from the pore peple; for and they hald not the hand
well and stedfast yn thys mater from hens forth whyle it shall dure, as
they have herebefore, the pore peple and all the grete part of both
shyres of Norffolk and Suffolk be destroyed. For it shewyth well by what
manyfold undewe menys of extorcion they have lyved yn myserie and grete
pouverte by manye yeers contynewed that the moste part of the comyners
have litill or nought to meynteyn their menage and housold, ne to pay
the Kyngs taskys, nothyr theyr rents and servises to the Lordz they be
tenants un too, as it shewyth daylie to all the world, whych ys overe a
grete pitie to thynk. And when the said pore peple have be by such
injuries overladd and so undoon, nedz most the gentlemen that have they
pore lyvelode amongs hem be gretely minisshed and hyndered of their
increse and levyng.

Item, where as I undrestand by a lettre sent to me from my welbelovyd
frende Maister John Botewryght, that grete extorcion have be don by the
officers of the duchee in takyng awey cxl. acres pasture at Swaffam,
whych ys of the Kyngs demeynz and of hys enheritaunce as of the duchee
of Lancaster, for whych pastures, yff it com not ynne ayen, it woll be
grete disheritaunce to the Kyng, and fynall destruccion of the tenauntes
there, for whych the said Maistre John desyryth and prayeth of remedie
yn the name of all the toune of Swaffam. As to thys such as wold here
the encrese and wellfare of hym, of hys parysshons, and off all thoose
mysdon untoo, most by the avice of som lerned man to put theyr
oppressions and grevaunces in wrytyng, well grounded, and as the trouth
of the mater ys, and that the said wrytyng or bille may be enseled wyth
the seles of such gentlemen that have lyvebode there, and wyth the men
that be cowthest knowen,[197.1] and that wrytyng so enseled to be
directed to the Kyng, and to the Lordz of hys Councell. And then it ys
and woll be of more credence to the Kyng and the Lordys then a simple
lettre. And thys doon wyth the labours that they may make there in
shewyng theyr grevaunces to the Commissioners; and the seid grevaunces
shewed also here amongs the Kyng and the Lordz, it ys verrayly to thynk
that they shall be purveyd of a remedie. And foryete not to sende or
wryte to Maister Botewryght in goodly haste of thys article wyth your
correccion to be had where the avertisementes of you and my frendz that
have more particuler knowlege yn such maters.

Item, I have grete mervaylle that yong Jenney, whych ys of my Lord
Cromewell councell, and Robert Ledam, also off hys councell, and hys man
be not spoke with there, that they doo not attaine an accion ayenst Sir
Thomas Tudden[ham], Heydon, and John Gent, whyche have and wold dayly
labour to disseisse my Lord Cromewell of a knyghten service in Saxthorp,
which ye have ryght suffisaunt evidenses by an endentures of Kyng Edward
iij^d dayes enseled, as of Kyng Herry dayes the iiij^the, that the seid
maner ys hald by the iiij^the part of a knyzt fee[198.1] of my Lord
Cromewell as of the maner of Tateshale. And the seid Tuddenham and
Heydon wold after theyr voulente have it hald yn meen of the maner of
Hetersete, whych sufficient evidenses that ye have specifyeth no thyng
soo. And I have lost xx^li. yeerly yn approwement[198.2] of my chatell,
for cause my Lord Cromewell, throw neglicence of hys officers in
Norffolk, have not meynteyned hys ryght. And there as John Bokkyng seith
that John Jenney hath no commaundment of my Lord to pursue hys ryght, it
shewyth off reson that seth he ys of hys councell in especiall for that
shyre, he ought doo hys ryzt to be savyd and kept of hys dewtee. And
thertoo he knouyth well that my said Lord hath commaunded hym dyvers
tymys to take kepe hys ryzt be savyd in thys mater. Wherfor I pray you
requyre hym on my Lord ys behalf[198.3] to compleyn to Justice at thys
_oyer_ [_and terminer_ for a] remedie, and that the [bi]lle be made yn
my Lordys name. And then to . . . . . . have commaundment ryzt sone of
my Lord eftsonys, and [_i.e._ if] he wolle sende unto hym by suche as
goth dayly into that contre to Tateshale. And I had send hym hys
speciall [com]maundment, had he sent me suche word betyme whyle he was
heere. I pray you remembre ye so John Jenney and Robert Ledham as I have
no cause to [wri]te more, ne to compleyn to my Lord of theyr necligence.

Item, Sir Parson, where it ys soo that my cosyn Boys ys passed to God,
whoos soule God assoyle, ye shall fynde amonges my bokes of accomptes at
Castre, or amonges othyr wrytynges, he owed me money for a ferm he heeld

shuld have an obligacion at Castre off, praying you to inquire off thys
dewteez, and see recuvere may be made off it.

Item, I seende a lettre at thys tyme to my cosyn Wychyngham, to hys

wrong takyng and wyth haldyng my shepe I ought take a accioun ayenst
hym; for declaracioun in whate wyse he dyd it, John Bele my sheperefe
can enforme you best, for he laboured about the recuvere of it. My Lady
Norfolk sent me a lettre viij. yere goon, whych I shuld hafe, desyryng
that the processe I was purposed take ayenst hym shuld be respited, and
all that reson wold he shuld obbey. I am avysed therfor let som man

ABSTRACT[201.2]

SIR JOHN FASTOLF TO JOHN BERNEY AND SIR THOMAS HOWYS.

[Sidenote: 1450 / DEC. 27]

Begs them to have heed to his matters to be sped on Tuesday after the
Twelfth, especially 'to labor the jury that was supposed to 'a past in
the office found for Tychewell,[201.3] that they may appear at Lynne,
and there make a certificate before my Lord of Oxford, and the Justice
William Yelverton, that they were never privy nor consenting to such an
office-finding.' On this an action may be founded against Dallyng, 'the
false harlot.' Would like Berney rewarded for his labor, if it were
secretly done, and Dynne also. 'Ye wete what I mean. I pray you see well
forth, for _Mitte sapientem_, &c.'

London, in haste, St. John's day in Christmas;[201.4] 'for he cam to
Castre, and there seye myn evydence, and than made the office therby,
and for Suffolk also, the fals offices found there in likewise, &c.' You
must sue him to the utmost.

  [The date of this letter is determined by the reference made in it
  to the Sessions held at Lynn, in the January following, before the
  Earl of Oxford and Justice Yelverton. --_See_ No. 167. At the foot of
  the original MS. is this inscription:-- 'Donum Rev. Fra. Blomefield,
  10 Dec. 1735.']

    [Footnote 202.1: [Add. MS. 34,889, f. 150.] The date of this

    though I have not met with the date of Daniel's appointment as
    Admiral, which would prove the year, it will be seen by the last
    paragraph of No. 142 that Wyndham was indicted at that time
    along with Toddenham and Heydon, as one of the makers of
    disorder in Norfolk.]

not take hese issues of thos rych extorssioners and oppressours of hese

that yf the kynge pardon hym or graunted any _supersedeas_, London shuld
with inne short tyme have as moche for to do as they hadde for to kepe
London Brygge whanne the Capteyn[207.2] cam thedir; for he told hym that
ther was up in Norffolk redy to ryse V M^l. comons yf they have not

herd this he was ryte glade therof, and dede Blake telle all this and

whanne they herden yt. And yf he hadde not a seyd this they shuld an

suggestion that it hadde be don of grette malyce. And so the lord Scales
meyntenyth Sir Thomas Tudenham in all that he may goodly, but he wyll

And it is here avyse that the meyre shuld purveye for hem in sum other

the Chaunceler for to lette the _supersedeas_ and the pardon; and ther
was grette langage atwex Blake and Tudenham; it wor to moche to wryte yt

ABSTRACT[209.1]

SIR JOHN FASTOLF TO JOHN A BERNEY AND SIR THOMAS HOWES.

[Sidenote: 1451 / JAN. 7]

Sends John Bokkyng on matters to be sped at the oyer and terminer. They
must remember a _certiorari_ is out of the King's Bench, and a
_procedendo_ was granted at one time 'for certain which had not appeared
in the place and pleaded.' Has received all the stuff contained in a
bill dated 28th November, made by John Davye of Yarmouth, and delivered
to one Roger Metsharp, master of the little boat called _The Blythe_.
Wonders they did not send the great ship with malt. Desires provisions
for Lent by next ship. Remind my cousin Inglos that the man that
'appeched' Heydon be sent hither, if he dare stand by his words. All the
indictments against Heydon are not worth a halfpenny. Howes must take
John a Berney's advice about this matter.

London, Thursday after Twelfth, 29 Hen. VI.

Let all who were on the inquest for Bardolf's matter be indicted,
whatever it cost.

[Sidenote: 1451 / JAN. 12]

Begs them to labour his matters, and forget not 'that old shrew,
Dallyng, for he is sore at my stomach.' Sends by the Parson a
_procedendo_ against Tudenham, which he has got out with great labour,
with a letter to my brother Yelverton. 'And as to an assize for
Hikkelyng, I shall be there on in the beginning of this term; and for
Tichewell in like wise.' Bokkyng must remind my cousin Inglos about the
indictments for treason of Heydon, 'that the man might be sent up to
preve the said matter.' Fears it has slept too long. Wishes his ship
_The Blythe_ sent to him.

London, 12 Jan. 29 Hen. VI.

Get my Lord [Oxford] and Yelverton to write a letter to Blake of the
King's house, thanking him for his friendliness to the country; 'and

his confession before hem, &c. And let the great men that have most
matters against [him] help somewhat to this good end.'

SIR J. FASTOLF TO SIR THOS. HOWYS AND JOHN BERNEY at Castre, in hast; or
at his place in Pokethorp, at Norwich.

[Sidenote: 1451 / JAN. 28]

Master Hue Acton has been with him for the new evidences ensealed for
the manor of Mundham, which F. has sold to the use of the Church of St.
Giles that he is master of, &c. Thanks them for what they have done for
him in his causes before the Commissioners of _oyer and terminer_ at
Lynne, &c. Hears Appulzerd's son expects the inquest of Mancroft in
Norwich to be reversed. Speak to my cousin Inglose about this. Fastolf's
audit books. My cousin John Berney puts me in great comfort by seeing to
the safeguard of my place in my absence. Would be sorry he should be
injured by having respited his entry into Rokelond Toffts at my request.

Make friends in Norwich against Easter when the _oyer and terminer_ is
to be held again, for I must proceed in the matter against Appulzerd.

London, 28 Jan. 29 Hen. VI.

  _Signed._

Begs them to send his grain and malt in a good vessel, well accompanied,
with a good wind, as he has had great losses before. Speak to the Mayor
of Norwich about Appulzerd's matter; 'for there was no city in England
that I loved and trusted most upon, till they did so unkindly to me and
against truth in the Lady Bardolf's matter.'

autoritate pacis media pro eorum posse per totum Norfolch. comitatum
diligenter conservare et pacis ejusdem perturbatores carceri vel castro
proprio mancipari facere, quaeritur quare dictus episcopus, pacis,
ut creditur, justiciarius, non vult in hac parte hujusmodi pacis
perturbatoribus resistere; sed magis eisdem in talibus insolenciis
favorem et auxilium in omnibus praebere.

4(o) Cum, secundum Apostolum,[218.4] furta, homicidia et talia vicia eis
similia sunt abhominabilia Deo et hominibus, ac utriusque legis divinae
et humanae contraria sacratis sanccionibus, in tantum quod non solum qui
talia agunt digni sunt morte, sed etiam qui conscenciunt agentibus; ex
quibus certe verisimiliter concluditur quod non solum Kervere, latro, et
Daniel famulus, furator equi ac murre satis notorius, puniretur una cum
fautoribus ejus.

5(o) Vestra discretio dicta Christi in Ewangelio diligenter consideret,
'Si in viridi ligno haec faciant, in arido quid fiet?'[218.5]

JAMES GLOYS TO JOHN PASTON[219.1]

_To my right reverente and wurchepfull Mayster, John Paston, Esquyer,
be this delivered in hast._

[Sidenote: 1451 / MARCH 1]

Right reverent and wurchepfull Sir, I recomand me to you, besechyng you
to wete that Wharles told me that Partrych seid that his lord[219.2]
knewe wele that ye were entred pesibilly in the maner of Gresham; where
fore, he seid, thow the tenauntes and fermors pay you the rents and
fermes the tyme that ye be in possession, his seid lord, thow he entre
ageyn, wuld never aske it them. Item, the seid Partrych seid to Wharles
that his lord wull come down hym self and entre in the seid maner within
short tyme. Wharles wull not discharge your baly of xvvj_s._ and
viij_d._, which he toke the seid baly enseled in a purs. The seid
Wharles told my mayster, John of Berney, at the court, that he repented
hym that he payd you any peny till he had be distreyned; and he seid
than pleynly that he wull nomore pay till he were distreyned. I have be
there divers tymes for to distreyn hym, and I cowde never do it but if
[_unless_] I wuld a distreyned hym in his moders hous, and there I durst
not for her cursyng. The baly of the hundred told me that Wharles spake
to hym in cas he had be distreyned that he wold have gete hym a replevy;
and the baly bad hym kete a replevy of his mayster and he wold serve it.

Item, the maner londs at Gresham, with othre tenaunts londs that be
fallyn in your hands ben letyn to ferme. I can gete no tenaunte to dwell
in the maner hous. And if the rede shuld be caryed thens, the tenaunts
shuld thynk that ye fered sum new entre, and it shuld sore discomfort
hem, for thei whisshed whan it was caried to the maner that it had be
leyd ther thus pesibly ij. yer afore. Asfor the obligacyon that ye shuld
have of the parson of Cressyngham, he seth he cam never at Cressyngham
syth he spake with you, and that he be heste it you not till
Fastyngong.[220.1] His hors ben stolyn, and therfore he may not ryde.

Item, Gonnore kept a court at Routon the Thursday[220.2] next after
Seynt Mathy[220.3] the Appostell, and it was told me that Bettes was
ther with hym; wherefore I rode theder. And be cause that it was a
fraunchised town and within the Duchye,[220.4] and also that Gonnor had
gret rewle in the seid town, I toke with me the baly of the hundred and
set hym with me in my Lord of Norffolks warant, and than yede in to the
court ther as Gonnor and Bettes wern. The seid baly told Gonnor of this
warant, and Gonnor rebuked hym so that he durst not a rest the seid
Bettes. Than I toke it up on me and arested hym myself as he sate be
Gonnor. Gonnor desired than to se my warant, and I shewed it hym, and he
seid he wold obey it as the lawe wold. And he proferyd me suerte, men of
the seid town of Routon. Than I told hym, and [_i.e._ if] he wold be
bownd hym self with othre I would agre ther to, but I wuld have no
shipmen that had nought, ner such men that rought [_cared_] never, and
thei were onys on the see, wheder thei come ageyn or noght. Than Bettes
toke Gonnor a _supersedias_ that he had of Wychyngham twelmoneth ago for
anothre man that asked suerte of the seid Bettes. I wold have had it,
and he wold not lete me have it, ner shewe it me but in his hands. Than
I told hym that it was noght, and he seid it was gode i nowe. I bad hym
take it me for my discharge, and he seid pleynly I shuld not have it.
Than I told hym I wold have my prisoner. The seid Gonnor seid I shuld
not have hym, and dede set alle the tenaunts up on me and made a gret
noyse, and seydyn alle pleynly I shuld not have hym yf he wold abyde
with hem. Than I told Gonnor that I shuld certifie a rescuse, and prayd
the baly of the hundred that he wold record the same. Item, the seid
Gonnor seid I myght have favoryd the seid Bettes the more be cause the
seid Bettes was my mayster Stapylton man, and that his men shuld not be
bownd and I shuld go lose. He seid I shuld be tyed or aght longe and
alle my feleshep bothyn; but, God yeld hym, he hath yovyn me iiij. days
respyte. Than I told hym it shuld never ly in his power to bynde me, ner
non of my feleshep so fast but that it shuld be in your power to make
hym to losyn us, and if that he abode in Norffolk he shuld be made to
seke the skyrts of his sadill or Esterne. And if he had kept his wey
that nyght I shuld have kept hym trewe covenaunte, for I lay on wayte up
on hym on the heth as he shuld have comen humward, and if I myght have
met with hym I shuld have had Bettes from hym; but he had leyd such
wetche that he had aspied us or he cam fully at us; and he remembered
Wyndhams manhood, that iiij. swyft fete were better than ij. hands, and
he toke his hors with the spores and rode to Felbrygge Hall as fast as
he myght rydyn, and I suppose he lay ther all that nyght.

Item, the seid Gonnor manased and thret John of Beston for he wuld not
warn hym her of; and he dede sease alle his lond in Routon, and warned
hym that he shuld not occupy his lyme kyll ner no lond that he had in
Routon; and he mad his avaunte whan I was gon, if that I had not brought
the baly of the hundred with me I shuld never have go thens; and yet,
not withstandyng that I brought the baly with me, and thei had wust
where myn hors had stond I shuld have be wele betyn. All this language
had thei whan that I was gon.

Item, the seid Gonnor seid after that I was gon to the tenaunts of the
seid town, that his _supersedias_ was noght, and as for the rescuse, he
shuld purvey a mene to excuse it. Where fore and it pleasyd you to send
my mastres word how that I shuld be demened with the seid Bettes, and
wheder that ye wuld I shuld a rest hym ageyn or nought, and to purvey
such a mene for Gonnor that he myght ley his bost, it shuld be gret
comfort to all yowr frendes and tenauntes ther abowtyn.

Item, I have be at my mayster Stapilton with your writtes, and he made
it right straunge for to ensele hem. He seid that he knew of nown such
inquiscion takyn at Swafham beforn hym; he seid if it were presented
ther, it was presented in his absens, whill that he was in his inne;
wherfore he seid he wold not ensele hem till he sey the bokes. Whan I
had answeryd hym ther to, than he seid he wold comown with my mayster
Yelverton her of whan he come home, and til he had spok with hym he wold
not ensele hem. I told hym my mayster Yelverton had enseled hem. Thann
he seid he knew not my mayster Yelverton seale. He shewed it to Gonnor,
and asked hym wheder it was his seall or noght. Gonnor seid it was his
sealle. Than my mayster Stapilton brake ought of this mater and spake to
me of the a restyng of Bettes and makyng of affray up on Gonnor. He seid
Gonnor cam to hym to compleyn up on me. I told hym that Gonnor had
enformed hym as it plesyd hym, for I had yove hym no cause to compleyn
of me, and if it pleased hym to her myn excuse he shuld fynd me in no
defaute. Whan he had herd myn excuse, he cowde not blame me. Meche othre
langage we had, for I was with hym ner an ower. Than he asked me wheder
the inquisicion was taken be fore the justice of the peas or the justice
of the _oyer determyner_. I told hym be for the justic of the peas, for
I seid it was the cessyons of the peas at Swafham. Than he bad me put up
my warants, for he seid he wold not ensele hem till he had comowned with
my maister Yelverton. I told hym it shuld not nede to comown with my
mayster Yelverton, ner labor hym therfore, for I seid it myght not hurt
thow he enseled hem not; for I seid the writts were executed, and that
the shereff had mad ought warants of them, and his warants were
executed, and so the seid writts shuld stand you in litill avayll, save
only, I told hym, ye desiryd his sealle, because it was fownd before
othre lords with hym, and that he stode in the _teste_ of the said
writts, and that was cause of my comyng theder. Than he wend I had comyn
for to assayn hym, for forthwith he enseled hem, but me thynk be his
langage he hath be labored of the toder part.

Item, and it pleased your gode maystershep to gete of my mayster
Yelverton a _supersedias_ for John Osborn and an othre for me. We
suppose that Gonnor and Bettes wull do us arest, and we wuld the
_supersedias_ that we haue ought of the Chauncery were kept till more
nede were. My mastres[222.1] recomand her to you, and prayth you to hold
her excused that she write yow no letter, for myche of the mater that
she shuld have wrete to you I had wrete in my letter or she knew ther
of; and also she knew not of so redy a massanger as I had. And it plesyd
your gode maystershep to send us a pardon for to assoylyn Gonnor this
holy tyme of Lentyn, the rather be cause of this gret bulle,[223.1] we
shuld leve in the more reste and peas, and kepe the more our pacyence
than we do. The Holy Trynyte have you in His kepyng. Wretyn on the
Monday next after Seynt Mathie[223.2] the Appostell, in hast.

  Your pore servaunte,

  JAMES GLOYS.

JAMES GLOYS TO JOHN PASTON[223.3]

_To my right reverent and wurchepfull mayster, John Paston, Esquyer,
be this delivered in hast._

[Sidenote: 1451 / MARCH 2]

Right reverent and wurchepfull Sir, I recomaund me to you, prayng you to
wete that I have labored divers men that ben enpaneld atwix my mastres,
your moder, and Wyndham.[223.4] Ther be many of them woll do her parte,
and ther ben summe that wull not passe ther upon, for thei ben aferd
that the werd [_world_] shuld turne. It is noysed in Norwhich that my
Lord of Oxenford, my mayster Yelverton, and ye, and John Damme shuld be
endited in Kent for mayntenaunce of the _oyer determyner_ in Norffolk;
and this, with othre feryth sore men of Norwhich. I trow my mastres
writyth to you here of more clerly. Item, Wyndham hath be divers tymes
at my mastres Cler, and mad hym erands to her, and told her that he was
sued in my mastres, your moders name but he supposyd that she knew not
there of. He thought that ye and James Gresham had do it un malyce, my
mastres your moders unknowyng. But whan he knew that I labored the
enqueste, than he sent my mastres Clere word how that he knew wele that
it was my mastres your moders labore. Item, he told my Lady of
Morle[224.1] of this sute, and he seid that he wend that my seid lady
had mad an hend a twix them for the seid sute. Item, Heydons men brought
his awyn hors and his sadyll thourgh Aylsham on Monday, and thei comyn
in at the Busshoppes gates at Norwhich and comyn over Tomelond and in to
the Abbey. Thei a bedyn there all that nyght, and ij. days after, wenyng
to men of the town that Heydon had go over the fery, and so in to the
Abbey; and sythyn thei seid thei shuld go to London for Heydon. Item,
sum seyn that Heydon shuld be mad a knyght, and myche othre langage ther
is which causyth men to ben aferd, wenyng that he shuld have a rewle
ageyn. Item, there were ij. men at John Betes of Holt; thei had langage
of the Lord Moleyns. If it please yow to enquere of Symond, brynger of
this letter, he shall enforme you of her langage. Item, Gonnor was
wetched at Felbrygge Halle with xl. persones of the Lady
Felbryggs[224.2] tenaunts and mor that night that I lay on wayte up on
hym, and he durst not go home on the next day till they brought hym
home. Thei mad a compleynt to my Lady Felbrygge, and my mastres had
excused it. Item, the manase Burflet, and wull sease his lond. Symond
shall telle yow how thei wer answered. Item, as for the subsidy that Sir
Herry I[nglos] and the Lady Felbrygge shuld payn, the meyr knowe not yet
veryly what thei schuld pay, for thei have not cast the valew of her
londs. The bill closyd in this letter maketh mensyon of the valew of
divers gentelmens londs that [ben] examyned in Norwhich. We can not know
what Calthorp payth, for we can not speke with the shereffe, ner the
undre [shereffe], ner no man that gadered that hundred ther as Calthorp
dwellytht. The Holy Trynyte have you in his kepyng. Wr[etyn] the Tuesday
next after Seynt Mathie,[225.1] in hast.

[Sidenote: 1451 / MARCH 3]

Rith worchipfull hosbond, I recommawnd me to yow, praying you to wete
that ther is a gret noyse in this town, that my Lord of Oxforth and
Yelverton and ye ben endytid in Kent for mayntenyng of the oyer
determyner; and Jon Dame is endytyd ther also of treson, be cawse that
he dede Heydon endytyn[225.3] of treson for takyng down of the quarter

ben sore aferd be cawse of this noyse, and of other langage that is had
bothe in this town and in the contre, that these seyd Todenham and
Heydon shuld ben as well at ese, and have as grett rewill as ever they

Jamys Gloys tellith me that he hath sent yow word of Heydonys hors and

DENYES TO JOHN PASTON[226.1]

_To my maister Paston._

[Sidenote: 1451 / MARCH 4]

Right wurshipfull sir, and my right good maister, I recomaunde me to
yow. It is so that up on an hasty sodeyn warnyng I departid from London
and spake not with yow at my departyng, Wherof I was full sory. I pray
yow, neverthelesse, that ye wole eftsones speke to William White with my
Lord Cardinall, for I desire his maistership and good will and wole do
to my power. And as touchyng to that that he semith I haf don agayn hym,
in good feith I wole abide your rule or, by Seynt Kateryne, his owen
rule. He is a gentilman and I wole don it with good will. I am right
sory ye had not set me thorgh with hym erst I went, for I haf prayed yow
ther of, as ye know your self dyvers tymes. The Holy Trynite preserve
yow. Wretyn at Wevenho the iiii. day of Merche.

  Your servaunt,

  DENYES.

   *   *   *

Sir, my Lord[226.2] hath kept sessions at Colchestre, and my maister
Yelverton with hym, and he desired me to write to yow to be wel ware if
ony fals suggestion or lesynges wer made by Tuddenham and Heydon and
that to your power thei be answerd in his absence. As for my Lord
Scales, her be seven of housold meny indited of felony, which are strong
thefes. Item, I pray yow, write in hast to the Meir of Norwich to gif
credens to me whan I come to hym, and if ye so do I shal shape their
articles in billes in to a nother facion I trust, and make thaym redy
and delyver thaym resonably wele. My Lord purposeth to be at London the
ende of the first weke of Lent, and not erst. I pray your maistership,
se sum meane that White do me not that harme in the Chauncery wherof ye
sent me word by Brayn, for, as God sauf my soule at the day of Jugement,
I fonde surete for the pees, but the Maister of the Rolles[227.1] ful
untruly recordeth that surete takyn as a baile, wher of treuth it was
otherwise, and ful synnefully ruleth that mater, and never wold suffir
me to execute the acte but lettid me, notwithstandyng it is a law
private in the self as I shal clerly declare whan I come. The Holy
Trinite preserve yow. I write to yow thus that ye may kyt awey this
lower part of this lettre.

    [Footnote 226.1: [Add. MS. 34,889, f. 169.] This letter must
    have been written in a year when Easter fell after the 20th
    April, as Lent does not appear to have begun on the 4th March;
    and as it was during the life of Cardinal Kempe, we may pretty
    safely fix it to the year 1451. The year 1454, indeed, might be
    possible as regards Easter, but there is no indication here of
    those troubles of which the writer complains so bitterly in that
    year on the 20th March. _See_ No. 239.]

Rith wurchipfull hosbond, I recommawnd me to yow, desiring hertily to

shall make hem not wurth apeny; and they ben aferd that he woll hold hem
conuawnt if he have powyr ther to. It is seyd her that the kyng shuld

cheryeshid with hym. And also it is seyd they shall have as grett rewill

therfore than mery. Sir Thomas Todenhamys man and Heydonys sowyn this
sedde all abowte the contre, that here maysteris shull cum hom in hast
in here prosperite and be als well att esse as ever they wer. As for

not how to don ther with, for if ever wer aspyid that hath of yowr
stuff, and we had it from hym, other that have more ther of wold ben
ware be hym, and avoyd seche stuff as they have of yowris. I suppose
John Osbern shall tell yow whan ye com hom agode meen to wete wher meche
ther of is becom. Jamys Gloys is ayen to Gressam and I suppose John
Damme shall tell yow what he hath donn ther. Yowr tenawntis wold fayn
that summe mene of yowris shuld abyde amongis hem, for they ben in gred
diswyr what they may do; the langage is so grett on the tother party

I send to yow a letter be Colynys of Frawnceys Costard what dedis he

Right wurchipfull hosbond, I recomawnd me to yow, beseching yow that ye
be not displeasid with me, thow my symplenesse cawsed yow for to be
displeasid with me. Be my trowth, it is not my will nother to do ne sey
that shuld cawse yow for to be displeasid; and if I have do, I am sory
therof, and will amend itt. Wherefor I beseche yow to forgeve me, and
that ye bere none hevynesse in your hert ayens me, for your displeasans
shuld be to hevy to me to indure with.

I send yow the roll that ye sent for, in selyd, be the brynger her of;
it was fownd in your trussing cofor. As for hering, I have bowt an
horslode for iiij^s. vj^d. I can gett none ell [_eels_] yett; as for
bever [_i.e. drinkables_], ther is promysid me somme, but I myt not gete
it yett. I sent to Jone Petche to have an answer for the wyndowis, for
she myt not come to me. And she sent me word that she had spoke therof
to Thomas Ingham, and he seyd that he shuld speke with yow hymself, and
he shuld accord with yow wel jnow, and seyd to her it was not her part
to desyr of hym to stop the lyts; and also he seyd itt was not his parte
to do itt, be cawse the place is his but for yeris.

And as for all other eronds that ye have commandid for to be do, thei
shal be do als sone as thei may be do. The blissid Trynyte have yow in

  Yowris,

  M. P.

    [Footnote 228.1: [From Fenn, iii. 238.] The date of this letter
    is quite uncertain. Fenn assigns it to the year 1454, when Lent
    began very late, as it is evident the herrings and eels referred
    to were intended as provision for that season. This conjecture
    may be correct; but it must be noted that John Paston was at
    home at Norwich, if not in the beginning of Lent, at least on
    the fourth Sunday of Lent in 1454. Moreover, if the date of this
    letter, 'Monday next after St. Edward,' means after the 18th
    March, which was the day of St. Edward the King and Martyr, the
    year 1451 would suit rather better than 1454; for, in the former
    year, the Monday after St. Edward's day would be the 22nd of
    March, and Ash Wednesday the 10th, while in the latter the
    Monday after St. Edward would be the 25th, and Ash Wednesday the
    6th, so that the provision of herrings would be very late.]

that myn unkyll Phylyp Berney[230.2] was at Lynne this last weke, and he
was at inne at the baylyffes hows of Lynne, and Partrych[230.3] came in
to the same place whill myn unkyll was ther. And the seid Partrych was
wele aqueyntyd with the balyffe, and the balyffe told hym that he sent a
letter to the Lord Molyns, and that the Lord Molyns had sent hym a
nother letter, letyng hym wete that he purposyd hym to be at Lynne thes
weke. Than Partrych seid that he had word that the seid lord purposyd
hym to be ther at that tyme; but he seid summe men supposyd that he wuld
not come here; and the balyffe seid that he was right glad that he shuld
come in to this countre. On of myn unkyll men herd all this langage, and

London. Item, it is noysed abowte Gresham and all that contre that the
Lord Molyns shuld be there in hast. Item, Gonnore had right gret
langage, and he trostyd that the word [_world_] shall turne sumwhat
after ther entent. Othre tydynges have we non, but that Tudenham and
Heydon shuld have ageyn the rewle in this contre, assmych as ever thei

and Lords forsaid, to comitte the said Sir Thomas Tudenham to preson,
ther to abide til in to the tyme that he to the said inditements hath
answerid, and to the billes and compleynts of the said inhabitauntz in

And more over, where that the said Sir Thomas Tudenham hath, among many
othre greet wrongs, ful synnefully causid a writte of assise of novell
dissessyn[232.2] to be brought ageyn John Aleyn and xxiij othre of the

for the reverens of God by that concideracion, that the jurry of the
said assise durst not, for drede of the horrible menaces of the said Sir
Thomas, othrewise do but be for sworn in gevyng their verdite in the
same assise, in which case the said inhabitauntz, for pyte and remorce
of their concyencez, wer lothe to sew a writ of atteynte,[233.1] to pray
the Kynge and Lords forsaid to ordeyn, by auctorite of this present
Parlement, that the said writ of assisse, verdit, recoverer, and the
jugement ther of, with every othre circumstaunce therof, be voide,
revokd, and adnulled, for the love of God.

ABSTRACT[233.5]

SIR JOHN FASTOLF TO SIR THOS. HOWYS, Parson of Castlecombe, at Castre.

[Sidenote: 1451 / APRIL 13]

Received a letter from them, 3rd April, with the last account of Sir Jo.
Kyrtelyng and Intewod. Understands Rob. Norwych will not occupy as
undersheriff, because Jenneys had given him language not to his
pleasure, and so Aleyn is to occupy, who is not F.'s wellwiller; but
Howys has provided a remedy with the sheriff. When the _venire facias_
is made out, I will try and get it sent you, and I shall have Paston's
advice. Knows well the obstinate will of false Dallyng, but Bokkyng must
speak with him, and entreat him in his best manner.--Margaret Bryg's
matter.

As to the oyer and terminer, it is certain Heydon and Tuddenham will be
at Norwich with all the maintenance and fellowship they can. It is said
Justice Prysot will be there. You must do your best to keep your friends
steadfast; and I in the meantime will labour here, and send you word how
the world is set. Men of the city of Norwich have good audience and
favour among the Lords, and are waiting an answer of their matters. Has
delivered up the shipmen, and left the ship here for causes which he
will write; 'for the rayse hath been full costuys, except they came in
saufftee.'

shuld fynde an armyd man, in tyme of werre in the castell of Norwhic,
xl. days to his owyn cost, and that ye shuld pay xxx^s. to the Kyng
yerly owth of the seyd maner; and it is fond also that your fader shuld
a died seysyd, and that ye shuld a entyryd ther in as heyr after your
fader dysseys, and that ye shuld be now up on the age of xxx. wynter.

ABSTRACT[234.4]

SIR JOHN FASTOLF TO SIR THOS. HOWYS, at Castre in Flegg.

[Sidenote: 1451 / APRIL 21]

Sends two _venire facias_ for Beyton in Norfolk and Bradwell in Suffolk,
returnable _in quindena Paschae_, which is a short day. You must deliver
them in haste to the Sheriff by Paston's advice, by whom I send them.
Labour to the Sheriff for the return of such panels as will speak for
me, and not be shamed, for great labour will be made by Wentworth's
party. 'Entreat the Sheriff as well ye can by reasonable rewards, rather
than fail,' for they have taken as false an issue as can be with me 'by
H. [_i.e._ Heydon's] advice for cold love.' I had traversed the plea in
the inquisition that I had disseised Sir Hue Fastolf; but they put it
now that I had only a joint interest in the manor. The names you sent
for Bradwell are like to do well, except Hopton, who has married with
the Lady Wentworth. I am also in doubt of one Reppes of Heringflete, who
is Heydon's man. Had purposed to have been at the oyer and terminer this
time, but cannot, &c.

Maister Paston, we comaund us to you, lattyng you witt that the Sheriff
is noght so hole as he was, for now he wille shewe but a part of his
frendeshippe. And also there is grete prese off pepill, and fewe
frendes, as ferr as we can feel yitt. And therfore be ye sadly avised
wheder ye seme best to come your self, or send or, &c., for we will
assay in as much as in us is to prevaile to your entente. And yett, if
it neded, we wolde have a man to giffe us informacion, or shewe evidence
after the case requireth. Also the Shereffe enformed us that he hath
writyng from the Kyng that he shall make such a panell to aquyte the
Lord Moleynes. And also he tolde us, and as ferr as we can conceyve and
feel, the Shereff wille panell gentylmen to aquyte the Lorde, and
jowroures to a quyte his men; and we suppose that it is be the mocion
and meanes of the othir party. And yif any meanes of tretie be proferd,
we know not what meane shulde be to your pleasir. And therfore we wolde
fayne have mor knowlege, yiff ye think it were to doo.

No more at this tyme, bot the holy Trinite have you in his kepyng.
Wretin at Walsyngham, in hast, the secund day of May.--Be your trewe and
feithfull frendes,

  DEBENHAM, TYMPERLEY, AND WHITE.

And also, Sir, as we conceyve, the Lord Moleynes shall not be quyte
before Thurseday; in as muche as he was indyted before the Justice, we
undirstand he shall not be quyte but before the Justice. Wherfore we
avise you, iff ye think it be to doo, to send your frendes in the meane
tyme, and come your self to your place at Sperham, and there abyde unto
tyme that we have knowlege how the saide mater will drawe, and till that
we may have worde from you, and ye from us, &c.

    [Footnote 235.1: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] As this letter speaks
    of the indictment and expected acquittal of Lord Molyns, the
    date must be 1451. This letter is written on parchment.]

W. LOMNOR TO JOHN PASTON[236.1]

[Sidenote: 1451 / MAY (?)]

Ryght worchipfulle Sir, yours goode cosynes and frendes avyse yow to
come to Walsyngham, and that ye be there to morw betymes at vj. on the
clok; for the Lord Moleyns offreth a trete for the goodes, and amendes
to be made, or he goth ought of this contre, and if it be not taken,
his men shulle justifie; wherupon your title might be hurte. The Lord
Skales, the Justis, and other knygtes and squyeres merveyle grettly ye
come not, and thow they that have not so true and evident mater as ye
have concelle yow to be absent; yet I wolde ye dede as ye be desyrd be
that felaship, for many wolde yow right welle. Whanne ye come, I shalle
telle yow more.

The Lorde Moleyns shulde not have be aquyte of his comaundement, hadde
he not sworen on a boke, sweche evidens was ayens hym; and ther is no
jentelman wolde aquite his men for no goode, &c.

    [Footnote 236.1: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] This letter has no
    address, but there can be no doubt from the contents it was

    Walsingham, and Paston's suit against Lord Molyns was still

Ryght worchipffull and welbeloved cosyn, I commaunde me to you as
herteli as I can, thankyng you off your goode chere the last tyme I was

  JOHN HEVENYNGHAM, Knyght.

    [Footnote 237.1: [From Fenn, iii. 144.] The date of this letter
    is doubtful, but it was evidently written at a time when John
    Paston had been for some considerable time absent from Norwich,

    1451. The writer of this letter died in July 1453.]

SIR THOMAS HOWYS TO SIR JOHN FASTOLF[238.1]

_To my reverent and worchepfull mayster, Sir John Fastolf, Knyght,
be this lettre delyvered._

[Sidenote: 1451 / MAY 9]

Right reverent and worchipfull maister, I recomaunde me louly un to yow.
Please you to wete the Sonday next after the Fest of the Invencion of
the Cros,[238.2] the ix. day of May, at Castre, I receyved a lettre from
you by your clerk, W. Barker, the tenure wherof I shall do spede in all
hast goodly. But for the more special cause of my wrytyng at this tyme
is to gef you relacion of the un true demenyng of this oure determyner,
by the parcialte of the Jugez of it; for whan the Counsell of the cite
of Norwich, of the toun of Swafham, youres, my Maister Inglose,[238.3]
Pastons, and many other playntyfs had put in and declared, bothe by
writyng and by woord by fore the Jugez, the lawfull excepcions in many
wise, the Juges by ther wilfulnesse myght nat fynde in ther hert to gef,
not als moche as a bek nor a twynclyng of ther eye toward, but toke it
to deriscion, God reforme such parcialte; and by cause Prisot[238.4]
thought that yf the Sessions of the oyer determyner had be holden at
Norwich as they bygonne, he supposed it shuld nat so fast passe to
th'entent of Tudenham and Heydon and ther felawes, as it shuld do
ell[es] in other place, but enjorned to Walsyngham, wher they have
grettist rule, ther to be holden on Tuesday, iiij^te day of May.

This knowing, my Maister Yelverton,[238.5] Genney, and other myght weel
conceyve how the governaunce of the oyer determyner shuld procede, for
it was the most parcial place of alle the shire, and thedre wer cleped
alle the frendez, knyghteys, and esquiers, and gentilmen that wolde in
nowise do other wise than they wolde. And the seid Tudenham, Heydon, and
other oppressours of ther set come doun theder, as I understand, with
iiij^c. [400] hors and more; and consideryng how ther wellwillers wer
ther assembled at ther instaunce, it had be right jowpertous and
ferefull for any of the pleyntyfs to have be present, for ther was nat
one of the pleyntyfs ner compleynuantez ther, but your right feithfull
and trusty weel willer John Paston. And my Maister Yelverton seid full
discretly, and countrolled the seid Prisot when he seid, sittyng, in the
Guyhalle of Norwich, these wordys to the Meyre and Commonalte, 'A, Sir
Meyre and your brethren, as to the processe of youre compleyntez, we
wole put them in contynuance, but in all other we wole procede;' which
wordys Yelverton thought right parciall. And by side this the seid
Prisot wolde suffre no man that was lerned to speke for the pleyntyfs,
but took it as a venom, and took them by the nose at every thred woord
whiche myght weel by knowe for open parcialte.

And as for the Lord Scalys, ye knowe well what he is toward you, and
namely for Hikelyng matter. Also to knowe som of your feynt frendes,
at that tyme that my Lord Norffolk sat at Norwich up on the oyer
determyner, Sir John Hevyngham myht nat fynde it in his hert to go iiij.
furlong from his duellyng place to the shirehouse, but now he cowd ryde
from Norwich to Walsyngham to syt as one of the Commyssioners. As to the
rule of other, that ye wolde have supposed your wellewillers, how they
have byhavyd them at Walsyngham, I shall sende yow woord in all hast
whan Bernay[239.1] come hom to Castr, for he is nat yet come from
Walsyngham. But this I knowe well, that they founde none obstacle ner
impedyment in ther consciens in all your matter; but how they have do
with Norwich, Swafham, and Paston, I am nat yet clerly informed;
I suppose they arn put in respite. I here sey Heydon seweth for an ende
to be had with the cite of Norwich, and as to the namys of them that
passed on ther acquitaile ayenst yow, Broyn can weell informe yow.
I understand that Sir Robert Conyers, Calthorp, Mundford wer capteyns,
and Maister Ric. Doget also.

Item, as for the ij. _venire facias_ ye sent to be retorned for your
manorz of Bradwell and Beyton, I have do them to be retorned of suche
namys as I have sent woord before, savyng sume be take, and except out.
Moreover, as for the mater of Sir John Sibton, Geney and Raulyns gef ful
counsell that it shuld abyde tyl the mater of Bradwell myght procede, so
that bothe maters myght take up on a day, for they sey it wold drawe xx.
marc to labour the Jure to London, and yet it wer hard to bryng about.
And they gef you counsell in all wise that ye labour to have Yelverton
Juge at that tyme, and in all wise bothe in that materz and in all
other, that ye be war that Prisot have not to have do in any wise, for
than all wole be nought. Of alle other materz I shall send you woord in
all hast goodly, for at thys tyme I had no leyser by cause of the hasty
comyng up of Hug Fen, whom I beseche yow to fele of the demenyng of the
oyer determyner, for he can telle yow moche and [_i.e._ if] he wole;
whether he wole or nay, I can nat sey, for I know wele he was at
Walsyngham. And I beseche All myghty Jesu have yow in his mercyfull
governaunce. Wrete at Castre, the Sonday, ix. day of May anno xxix(o)
Regis Henrici vj^ti.

deserved, and if he had he wold a take it. And whan I departyd from hym,
I desyerid hym a yen to send therffore, and than he seyde it shuld abyde
tyl ye come hom, wherby I conceyve he wold have it, and be gladde to
take it. Moreover, I remembred hym of hese promyses made before to yow
at London, when he took hese oth and charche, and that ye were wyth hym
when he toke hese oth, and oder dyvers tymes; and for tho promyses made
be hym to yow at that tyme, and other tymes at the oyer determyner at
Lynne, ye proposed yow be the trust that ye have in hym for to atempte
and rere accions that shuld be to the avayle of hym and of hese office.
He wold a know what the accions shuld be. I sayde I coude not telle hym,
and than he seyde he wold do for yow that he may, excepte for the
aquitell of the Lord Molyns men, in so meche as the Kyng hath wrete to
hym for to shewe favour to the Lord Moleyns and hese men, and as he
seyth the indytement longyth to the Kyng, and not to yow, and the Lord
Molyns a gret lord. Also, as he seyth, now late the Lord Molyns hath
sent hym a letter, and my Lord of Norffolk anoder, for to shew favour in
these indytements, he darnot abide the joporte of that, that he shuld
offende the Kinges commaundment. He know not how the Kyng may be
informed of hym, and what shal be seyde to hym.

And than I sayde as for any joporte that he shuld abyde in any thing
that he doth for yow, or be your desyre, you have offered hym, and wol
performet, sufficient sewerte for to sawe hym harmeles, and therfore I
supposid ther wold non resonable man thynk but that he myght do for yow
wyth owte any joporte. And then he seyde he myth non sewerte take that
passid C_li._; and the Lord Molyns is a gret lord, he myght soon cause
hym to lese that, and meche mo. Than I sayde, be that meane, in defawte
of a Shereff, every man may be put from hese lyvelod; and thann he seyde
iff it were for the lyvelode, men wold take hem the nerer for to abyde a
joporte; but be hese feyth, as he swore, if the Kyng wryte ayan to hym
he wol no lenger abyde the joporte of the Kyngges wrytyng, but he
trustyth to Godde to inpanell seche men as shuln to hise knowleche be
indeferent, and non comon jurors. As me semyth it wold do goode and
[_if_] ye wolde gett a comaundment of the Kyng to the Shereff for to
shew yow favour, and to inpanell jantelmen, and not for to favour non
seche riotts, &c.; for he seyde that he sent yow the letter that the
Kyng sent hym, and ye seyde a man shuld gete seche on for a noble.

Item, I remembred hym of the promyses that he hath made to Temperley,
and that if he wold make yow very trew promys, ye wold rewarde hym as
meche as he wold desire, or any other resonable man for him, and asmoche
and mor then any adverserry ye have wold gef hym; than he seyde he toke
never no mony of non of hem alle. There was proferid hym at Walsyngham
for the Lord Molyns xx. nobles, he had not a peny; moreover, I proferid
hym, if he wold make yow promys that ye myght veryly trust upon hym, ye
wold geff hym in hande as he wold desire, or to leve a summe if he wold
a named it in a mene mannys hand, and seche as he hath trust to. And
then he seyde, if he myght do for yow, or if he do any thyng for yow,
then he wol take yowre mony wyth a good wyl; and other promys I coude
not have of hym, but that he wol do for yow all that he may, excepte for
the inditements. I conceyve veryly he hath made promys to do hese part
that they shul be a quytte, but I suppose he hath made non other promys
ayens yow for the lyvelode; but he lokyth aftyr a gret brybe, but it is
not for to trust hym veryly wyth owte that he may not chese. I suppose
he had no wrytyng fro my Lord of Norffolk as he seyde.

I was at Framyngham for to a spoke wyth Tymperley, Debnam, or Berry,
and they were all ought. My Lord, as he came from London, he was at
Yepysweche on Moneday, and when he wythowth the town toward Framyngham,
he had all hese men ryde forth afore a gret pase, for he wolde felwe
softely; and when hese men were owte of syght, he rode wyth v. men to a
squieris place of hese therby, and on Tewsday, rodde my Lady to hym; and
so I dede nought at Framyngham. No more at thys tyme, but All myghty
Jesu spede yow, and have yow in hese kepyng. Wrete at Norwiche, the
Thursday next aftyr Sent Austyn, &c.

  Be your servunt,

  JOHN OSBERN.

    [Footnote 241.1: [From Fenn, iii. 308.] At the date of this
    letter Lord Molyns had probably been acquitted, but the action
    against his men was still pending. The year must therefore be
    1451. The date 'Thursday next after St. Austin' is understood by
    Fenn to be after the Feast of St. Austin, or Augustine, Bishop
    of Hippo, which was celebrated on the 28th of August; but the
    dates of the preceding letters make it more probable that the
    writer means St. Augustine, the apostle of England, whose day
    was the 26th of May.]

    is not very satisfactory. From the definition of 'owler' we
    might perhaps conjecture with more probability that 'to owl' was
    to work in the night time. Did Agnes Paston, to avoid
    interruption, set men to build the wall by night?]

but he shall owte, for he is hald rygth apore man. I suppose if ye lyke

is the Lady Boysys,[248.2] and kepyth itt with strength with seche
another felashep as hath be att Brayston, and wastyth and dispoylyth all

    1450, and, from the terms of the allusion, that event must have
    been pretty recent. The date of this letter, however, cannot be
    earlier than 1451, as Lady Boys must have been a widow at the
    time, and she only became so in December 1450. --_See_ Letter

ABSTRACT[252.1]

SIR J. FASTOLF to SIR THOMAS HOWYS, Parson of Castlecombe.

[Sidenote: 1451(?) / JULY 20]

Has received his letter by Herry Hansson. Does not think he authorised
Howys to have Andrews and his other adversaries noted and corrected at
_oyer and determyner_; but if there was any letter to that effect, F.
will bear him out. Thinks even if there was any letter to that effect

have been sued for conspiracy. If Andrews and the others had been sued

SIR JOHN FASTOLF TO JOHN BERNEY, SIR THOS. HOWYS, AND WALTER SHIPDAM.

[Sidenote: 1451 / SEPT.]

Begs them to hasten Rob. Boothe to London. Hears that the _oyer and
termyner_ is to be at Norwich on Thursday[252.3] after Holyrood day,
and that Will. Yelverton, justice, is to be there. Ascertain, therefore,
how the substantial men of Norwich are inclined in my matter against
Appulzerd, and take Paston's advice in proceeding. Is advised to send
John Bokkyng or Will. Barker to them before the time. Bids them send an
indenture of Cornelys Floryson about wheat and malt. Has arrested the
ship. As to the matter against Applierd, if Todenham, Heydon, Wymondham,
&c., or any of them, will labour for their acquittal against me in the
Lady Bardolf's matter, you must oppose it. Trusts the present mayor and
his predecessor know what he has done for the town, and Will. Jenney and
his brother can testify to Applierd's demeanour. You must get a copy of
the indictment, lest he deny the presentment. Sends a lease of Lady
Sterburgh's part and Bardolf's, made by Wichingham and Blake, and a
confirmation of Sir Reynold Cobham,[253.1] and the said Lady Sterburgh
his wife, &c. Commend me to my Lord of Ely[253.2] and my Lord of Oxford
if they be there, and my coz. Yelverton, and ask my Lord of Norwich for
tidings of Hikelyng. 'Item, blessed be God of his visitation! I have
been sore sick and am well amended, and trust to our Lord to see you
hastily and other of my friends.'

[Sidenote: 1451 / SEPT. 14]

As the _oyer and termyner_ is to be at Norwich on Thursday next,[253.4]
sends John Bokkyng to wait upon his counsel there to see to his matter
against Appulzerd. They are to spare no cost to bring it to a good end,
especially the bill of maintenance against Appulzerd, who was the
greatest cause that the inquest passed against F. so untruly.

    entered the manor of Brayston or Braydeston during the sitting
    of the Parliament at Leicester in the spring of 1450. He was
    dispossessed by Mundford and Heydon on the 7th September

    year of Henry VI., _i.e._ some time between the 1st September
    1451 and the 31st August 1452. In this letter it is anticipated
    that he will be enabled to enter the place by his influence with
    Lord Scales and the Duke of Somerset. This cannot refer to his
    first entry, as Somerset was in France for a long time before.]

[Sidenote: 1452 / [APRIL 30]]

I John Clopton, Shereffe of Norffolk, certifie that wher oon John
Falyate and othre were take within the hundred of Blofeld in the seid
shire, and led to the castell of Framlyngham in the counte of Suffolk,

the last day of Aprill receyved at the seid castell a bille of divers
knowlech and confessyons which were enformyd me shuld have be mad in the
presens of my seid Lords Councell be Roger Chirch and othre, which the
seid John Falyate, as it was enformed me, shuld have confessid to have
be trewe. After which bille receyved and be me red and understand,
callyng befor me the seid John Falyate and alle othre that where
examyned, except the seyd Roger Chirch, in the presens of divers of my
Lords Councell there, I red to the seid John Falyate the tale comprised
in the seid bille seid be the seid Roger Chirch, demawndyng hym of the
trought her of; wherto he answered, and seid that he wust wele ther was
no wey with hym but deth, and therfore, as he wuld answer afore God, he
wuld sey the trought, and seid that the substaunce of the tale told be
the seid Roger Chirch was untrewe, and feyned and imagyned be the same
Chirch, and that he never had knowleched that the tale to be trewe.
Neverthelesse he seid that he was with a felesshep gadered undre
Possewykwode be the prokeryng of the seid Chirch, which feleshep, whan
thei were all togeder, passid not the nombre of xv. persones. And that
the seid Chirch wast the furst that ever mevid hym for to come theder,
seying that he shuld have feleshep i nowe and do goode, for he was
balyffe of the hundred, and be colour of his office he shuld send in men
i now, and that he knew a gode name for her capteyn, that shuld be John
Amend Alle. More over I the seid Shereffe asked the seid Falyate if thei
whan thei wer to geder spoke of Paston and othre gentilmen named in the
seid bille to have assisted hem; and he seid pleynly nay, but that thei
and othre thryfty men were noysid be the seid Chirch and be his
councellores sith the tyme of the gaderyng of the seid feleshep, and
never was spokyn of ther. In like wyse seid othre that were examyned in

Strecok of Sparham have gete a respyte of Nicholas Byschop for the

wythstandyng this respite myght never be gete tyll that Byschop had a
reward of mony; it is told me he toke viij_d._ for hese reward. The
dryvers ought of the catell fro Sparham ground to Lyng grownd were Hugo
Sadde of Baldeswell, Byschoppis man, Nicholas Gatesend, Roberd Joye,

trostid to my lord of Norffolkis lordchep and ritewesnesse that he wold
see that Charles shuld be sharply correctyd for hese trespasse and
mysrewle, or ellis the jentelmen of the shire must to giddyer purvey
anodyer meane; and he seid it wold never odyerwyse be, but if he had
spoke wyth yow or ye redyn to London he hopid be your avys he shuld a
perveyd a meane to a set that in correccion, and also the trobyl for the
maner of Brayston, for that was cause of all. For he seide he had spoke
wyth my lord Skales and he is wel disposid to yow and vn the best wyse
and wel do . . . yow that he can, so that he wold forsake Danyell. This
was seyde in a diswere, savyng he told me he must . . . . pleayne he
told me many more thyngges and tales I pray you of your maistechep
(_sic_) hold me excusid that I wryte hem [not], but they were not alle
of gret substans, &c. I had gret cher, he comaunded me to be had into

Ryth reverent and trusty Cosyn, I recomande me to zow, thankyng zow of
zour good wil and counseill. Like zow to wete, I cam hom be myn Lord of
Oxeford and told hym of the greet labour of Sir Thomas Tudenham and
Heydon for schirevez of owr schire, and namyd the personez quom thei
laboryd fore, and myn Lord agreeyth not to tweyne of hem; to the knyth
he seyd not moch to, but I felt my lord he wold labore for William
Dorward, myn neview.[275.2] And thanne I answerd, Sir, he may not
profite me in myn matere for he hath weddyd myn nece. Also I felt myn
Lord that myn Lord Crumwell laboryth for Stonham of Huntyngton schire,
Sir John Tirell howe [_who_] weddyd hese modir, hese sone executour to
my Lady Clyfton, with Heydon and othir memento, &c. And to fore I cam to
Framyngham myn lord of Norffolk hadde wrytyn for Sir Robert Conyers,
takyng promys of hym to be rewlyd in alle matterez as myn Lord of
Norffolk wil avyse hym, and as an undirschireve ze schall be acounseill
therof. And as touchyng Lee, as I am enformyd, ther ys no man that he
wil do lesse for thanne for Sir Thomas Tudenham. And as touchyng myn
seyd Lord of Norffolk, he hath wrytyn, or I cam, be Debenham, as he may
not wel returne, and the personez ben Sir Robert Conyers, Henry Gray,
Thomas Brews. And I suppose as for Thomas Brews he schall be translate
in to myn brothir John Blake, but myn seyd Lord of Norffolk hath previly
(?) wrytyn to the Kyng for Sir Robert Conyers promisyd[276.1] be the
seyd Sir Robert that he schall non undirshireve, ne non othir officer

Herman seyth to him it is his place. As for Cokets mater, my doughter
your wyf told me yester even the man that suyth him will not stonde to

Bertilmow White is condemnyd in Forrenecet Court in xl. marc, as it is

Item, as for Talfas, the Sherevis hav be hest to do all the favour thei

and how Caly hadde ben at hem,[278.2] and desired to carye up Talfas on
his owen cost, and yeve hem goode wages.

Item, John Osbern seide to me this day that he supposed thei will not
have him up be forn Estern, and Margerete Talfas seide to me the same
day that men tolde hire that he shulde never have ende till he wer at
London, and asked me counsell wheder she myte yeve the Sherevys sylver
or non; and I tolde hire if she dede, I supposed she shulde fynde hem
the more frendly.

Item, as for Horwelbur, I sende you a bill of all the rescyts syn the
deth of your fader, and a copy wrete on the bak how your fader lete it

It is seid in this contre that my Lord of Norfolk seith Ser John Fastolf

    [Footnote 278.1: [From Fenn, iii. 162.] This letter is certainly

    some time after Lady Boys became a widow, which was in December
    1450 (_see_ p. 198), and before Sir John Fastolf's removal from
    London into Norfolk, which, as will be seen hereafter, was in
    the autumn of 1454. Probably the true date is 1452, for in the

    [Footnote 284.1: [From Fenn, i. 68.] According to Blomefield
    (_Hist. of Norf._ iii. 158), Margaret of Anjou, Queen of
    Henry VI., visited Norwich in the spring of 1452; but by the
    same authority, it would appear that she had returned to
    Westminster before the 17th of March in that year, which would
    not suit the date of this letter. Besides, John Paston was at
    Norwich in April 1452, and dates a letter at Norwich on St.
    George's day, complaining of the assault made upon him at the
    door of Norwich Cathedral on Monday before Easter. It is
    impossible, therefore, that Margaret Paston could have written
    to him from Norwich two days before St. George's day in that
    year. From an undated entry in the Norwich city records, which
    bears internal evidence of having been made in the year 1453, it
    would appear that the King's half-brothers, Edmund, Earl of
    Richmond, and Jasper, Earl of Pembroke, visited Norwich in that
    year.--(_See_ fol. 19 of a volume, entitled _An Old Free Book_,
    in the Norwich city archives.) As to the Queen's visit I find no
    direct evidence, but I think it possible she may have come with
    _one_ of the King's brothers, and that the other may have come a
    little later.]

    a daughter of that name, while the widow occurs frequently in
    this correspondence.]

Rytht worchipfull hosbond, I recommawnd me to yow, praying yow to wete
that I have spoke with Newman for his place, and I am thorow with hym
therfor, but he wold not lete it in no wyse lesse than v. marc. I told
hym that sekyrly ye shuld not know but that I hyrid it of hym for
iij_li._ I seyd as for the noble,[287.1] I shuld payt of myn owyn purse,
that ye shuld no knowlech have therof. And this day I have had inne ij.
cartfull of hey, and your stabyl shall be made I hope this next weke.
I kowd not gette no grawnt of hym to have the warehows; he seyth if he
may in any wyse forber itt her after, ye shall have itt, but he wull not
grawnt itt in no convawt [_covenant_]. He hath grawntyd me the hows be
twix the vowte and the warehows, and that he seyd he grawntyd not yow.

And as for the chamer that ye assygnyd to myn unkyl,[287.2] God hath
purveyd for hym as hys will is; he passyd to God on Monday last past, at
xj. of the clok befor none, and Sir John Hevenyngham passyd to God on
Tewysday last past; hois sowlys both God assoyle. His sekenesse toke hym
on Tewysday, at ix. of the clok befor none, and be too after none he was

I have begonne your inventare that shuld have be made or this tym, if I
had ben well at ease. I hope to make an ende therof, and of other thyngs
both this next weke, and ben in that other place, if God send me helth.
I must do purvey for meche stuff or I come ther, for ther is nother
bords ne other stuff that must neds be had or we come there. And Richard
hath gadderid butt lytill mony syth he come from yow. I have sent John
Norwod this day to Gresham, Besigham, and Matelask to gete als meche

    8d.; but Margaret said she would pay the odd noble, or 6s. 8d.,
    out of her own purse, and not let Paston know but that he had
    the place for L3. A little artifice for accepting terms which
    she had doubtless told Newman her husband could never agree to.]

    that of her other letters. The date seems to be after the death
    of Sir John Heveningham in 1453, and is not likely to have been
    a later year, as the Duchess of Suffolk's influence must have
    been diminished when the Duke of York came into power, though it

THE DUKE OF NORFOLK'S PETITION[290.1]

[Sidenote: 1453]

My Lordes, ye know well ynough the grete peynes, labours, and diligences
that before thys tyme y have doon, to th'entent that the over greete
dishonneurs and losses that ben come to thys full noble royaume of
England by the fals menes of som persones that have take on theym over
grete autoritee in thys royaume shulde be knowen, and that the persones
lyvyng that have doon theym shulde be corrected aftyr the merites of her
desertes. And to that entent y have denounced and delyverd to you in
wrytyng certeyn articles ayenst the Duc of Somerset, whych ys one of
theym that ys gylty thereoff, whertoo the Duc of Somerset have aunsuerd;
and to that that he hath aunsuerd y have replyed yn such wyse that y
trowe to be sure ynough that there shall no vayllable thyng be seyd to
the contrarie of my seyd replicacion, and asmoch as he woold sey shall
be but falsnesse and lesyngs, as be the probacions that shall be made
thereuppon shall mow appiere; how be it that to alle people of gode
entendement, knowyng how justice owyth to be ministred, it ys full
apparaunt that the denunciacions ayenst hym made ben sufficiently preved
by the dedes that have folowed thereoff; whereuppon y have requyred to
have ouverture of justice by yow, whych ye have not yhyt doon to me,
whereoff y am so hevy that y may no lenger beere it, speciallie seth the
mater by me pursued ys so worshipfull for all the royaume, and for you,
and so greable to God, and to alle the subgettys of thys royaume, that
it may be no gretter. And it ys such that for anye favour of lignage, ne
for anye othyr cause there shulde be no dissimulacion, for doubt lest
that othyr yn tyme comyng take example thereoff, and lest that the full
noble vertue of justice, that of God ys so greetly recommaunded, be
extinct or quenched by the fals oppinions of som, that for the grete
bribes that the seyd Duc of Somerset hath promysed and yoven them, have
turned theyr hertys from the wey of trouth and of justice; some seyeng
that the cases by hym committed ben but cases of trespasse, and othyr
takyng a colour to make an universell peas. Whereoff every man that ys
trewe to the seyd Coroune auyth gretely to marveylle, that anye man wold
sey that the losse of ij. so noble duchees as Normandie and Guyen, that
ben well worth a greet royaume, comyng by successions of fadres and
modres to the seyd Coroune, ys but trespasse; where as it hath be seen
in manye royaumes and lordshyps that, for the losse of tounes and
castells wythoute sege, the capitaynes that hav lost theym han be deede
and beheded, and her godes lost; as in Fraunce one that lost
Chyrborough; and also a knyght that fledd for dred of bataille shulde be
byheded, soo that alle these thyngs may be founden in the lawes wryten,
and also yn the boke cleped _L'arbre de Bataille_. Wherfor, for to
abbregge my langage, y requyre you that forasmech as the more partie of
the dedes committed by the seyd Duc of Somerset ben committed yn the
royaume of Fraunce, that by the lawes of Fraunce processe be made
thereuppon; and that all thyng that y have delyvered and shall delyvere
be seen and understand by people havyng knoulige theroff, and that the
dedes committed by hym in thys royaume bee yn lyke wyse seen and
understand by people lerned yn the lawes of thys land; and for preffe
thereoff to graunt commissions to inquere thereoff, as by reason and of
custom it owyth to be doon, callyng God and you all my Lordes to
wytnesse of the devoirs by me doon in thys seyd matere; and requyeyng
you that thys my bille and alle othyr my devoirs may be enacted before
you. And that y may have it exemplified undre the Kyngs grete seele for
my discharge and acquytaille of my trouth, makyng protestacion that in
case ye make not to me ouverture of justice upon the seyd caas, y shall
for my discharge do my peyn that my seyd devoirs and the seyd lak of
justice shall be knowen through all the royaume.

    [Footnote 290.1: [From Fenn, iii. 108.] This paper is headed
    'Copia' in the MS. It is entitled by Fenn, 'The Speech of John
    Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk, against Edmund Beaufort, Duke of
    Somerset, in the House of Lords.' This title, however, is
    clearly no part of the original document, which has much more
    the character of a petition to the Privy Council than of a
    speech in Parliament. The paper itself professes to be a 'bill'
    signed by its author, who demands that the conduct of the Duke
    of Somerset in France and in England should be made the subject
    of investigation by separate tribunals according to the laws of
    either country. Now the House of Lords, being only a branch of
    the English Legislature, would have had no right to authorise a
    judicial investigation in France. The date of this petition must
    have been in the end of the year 1453, after the loss of
    Guienne. The Duke of Somerset appears to have been committed to
    the Tower a little before Christmas in that year; for, after his
    liberation on the 4th March 1455, he declared before the Council
    that he had been confined there 'one whole year, ten weeks, and
    more.' --_See_ Rymer, xi. 362.]

NEWSLETTER OF JOHN STODELEY[295.2]

[Sidenote: 1454 / JAN. 19]

As touchyng tythynges, please it you to wite that at the Princes[295.3]
comyng to Wyndesore, the Duc of Buk' toke hym in his armes and presented
hym to the Kyng in godely wise, besechyng the Kyng to blisse hym; and
the Kyng yave no maner answere. Natheless the Duk abode stille with the
Prince by the Kyng; and whan he coude no maner answere have, the Queene
come in, and toke the Prince in hir armes and presented hym in like
forme as the Duke had done, desiryng that he shuld blisse it; but alle
their labour was in veyne, for they departed thens without any answere
or countenaunce savyng only that ones he loked on the Prince and caste
doune his eyene ayen, without any more.

Item, the Cardinalle[296.1] hathe charged and commaunded alle his
servauntz to be redy with bowe and arwes, swerd and bokeler,
crossebowes, and alle other habillementes of werre, suche as thei kun
medle with to awaite upon the saufgarde of his persone.

Item, th'erle of Wiltshire[296.2] and the Lord Bonvile have done to be
cryed at Taunton in Somerset shire, that every man that is likly and
wole go with theym and serve theym, shalle have vj_d._ every day as long
as he abidethe with theym.

Item, the Duk of Excestre[296.3] in his owne persone hathe ben at
Tuxforthe beside Dancastre, in the north contree, and there the Lord
Egremond[296.4] mette hym, and thei ij. ben sworne togider, and the Duke
is come home agein.

Item, th'erle of Wiltshire, the Lord Beaumont, Ponynges, Clyfford,
Egremond, and Bonvyle, maken all the puissance they kan and may to come
hider with theym.

Item, Thorpe[296.5] of th'escheker articuleth fast ayenst the Duke of
York, but what his articles ben it is yit unknowen.

Item, Tresham,[296.6] Josep,[296.7] Danyelle,[296.8] and
Trevilian[296.9] have made a bille to the Lordes, desiryng to have a
garisone kept at Wyndesore for the saufgarde of the Kyng and of the
Prince, and that they may have money for wages of theym and other that
shulle kepe the garyson.

Item, the Duc of Buk' hathe do to be made M^{l}. M^{l}. [2000] bendes
with knottes, to what entent men may construe as their wittes wole yeve
theym.

Item, the Duke of Somersetes herbergeour hath taken up all the loggyng
that may be goten nere the Toure, in Thamystrete, Martlane, Seint
Katerines, Tourehille, and there aboute.

Item, the Queene hathe made a bille of five articles, desiryng those
articles to be graunted; wherof the first is that she desireth to have
the hole reule of this land; the second is that she may make the
Chaunceller, the Tresorere, the Prive Seelle, and alle other officers of
this land, with shireves and alle other officers that the Kyng shuld
make; the third is, that she may yeve alle the bisshopriches of this
land, and alle other benefices longyng to the Kynges yift; the iiij^th
is that she may have suffisant lyvelode assigned hir for the Kyng and
the Prince and hir self. But as for the v^th article, I kan nat yit
knowe what it is.

Item, the Duke of York wole be at Londone justly on Fryday next
comyng[297.1] at night, as his owne men tellen for certain, and he wole
come with his houshold meynee, clenly beseen and likly men. And th'erle
of Marche[297.2] cometh with hym, but he will have a nother feliship of
gode men that shall be at Londone before hym . . . that he is come;
and suche jakkes, salettes, and other herneys as his meyne shulle have,
shalle come to Londone with hem, or before hem in cartes. The Erle of
Salesbury[297.3] wille be at Lon[don] on Monday[297.4] or Tywesday next
comyng with seven score knyghtes and squyers, beside other meynee. The
Erles of Warwyk,[297.5] Richemond,[297.6] and Pembroke[298.1] comen with
the Duke of Yorke, as it is seide, everych of theym with a godely
feliship. And natheles th'erle of Warwyk wole have M^{l}. men awaityng
on hym beside the feliship that cometh with hym, as ferre as I can
knowe. And as Geffrey Poole seithe, the Kynges bretherne ben like to be
arrested at their comyng to Londone, yf thei come. Wherfore it is
thought by my Lordes[298.2] servauntz and welwillers here that my Lord,
at his comyng hider, shalle come with a gode and clenly feliship, suche
as is likly and accordyng to his estate to have aboute hym; and their
harneys to come in cartes, as my Lord of Yorkes mennes harneys did the
last terme, and shalle at this tyme also. And over that, that my Lord
have a nother gode feliship to awaite on hym and to be here afore hym,
or els sone after hym, in like wise as other Lordes of his blode wole
have.

And for the more redynesse of suche feliship to be hade redy, that my
Lord send sadde and wise messagers to his servauntz and tenauntz in
Sussex and elswhere, that they be redy at London ayenst his comyng, to
awaite on my Lord; but lete my Lord beware of writyng of lettres for
theym, lest the lettres be delivered to the Cardynalle and Lordes, as
one of my Lordes lettres was nowe late, for perill that myght falle,
for that lettre hathe done moche harme and no gode.

And as for suche tydynges as ben contened in the lettre sent home by
John Sumpterman, I can nat hiderto here the contrarie of any of theym,
but that every man that is of th'opynion of the Duke of Somerset[298.3]
makethe hym redy to be as stronge as he kan make hym. Wherfore it is
necessarie that my Lord loke wele to hym self and kepe hym amonge his
meyne, and departe nat from theym, for it is to drede lest busshementes
shuld be leide for hym. And yf that happed, and my Lord came hiderward,
as he hathe ben used for to come, he myght lightly be deceyved and
betrapped, that God defende. And therfore lete my Lord make gode wacche
and be sure.

The Duke of Somerset hathe espies goyng in every Lordes hous of this
land; some gone as freres, som as shipmen taken on the sea, and som in
other wise; whiche reporte unto hym all that thei kun see or here
touchyng the seid Duke. And therfore make gode wacche, and beware of
suche espies.

And as touchyng the privee scale and my Lordes seurtee, it is necessarie
that my Lord be advertised that yf the Chaunceller,[299.1] or any other,
make any question to my Lord of his comyng contrarie to the teneur of
the seid privee seall, that my Lord by his grete wisdom make answere
that he was credibly enformed that aswele the Duke of Somerset beyng
prisoner, as other beyng at large, holdyng his opynyon ayenst the wele
of the Kyng and of the land, made grete assemblees and gaderyngs of
people, to mayntene th'opinion of the seid Duke of Somerset and to
distrusse my Lord; and that the comyng of my Lord in suche forme as he
shalle come is onely for the saufgarde of his owne persone, and to none
other entent, as my Lord hym self can sey moche better than any that is
here kan advertise hym.

Thise thinges aforseid ben espied and gadred by my Lord Chaun   ,[299.2]
John Leventhorpe, Laurence Leventhorpe, Maister Adam, William Medwe,
Robert Alman, John Colvyle, Richard of Warderobe, and me, John Stodeley.
And as sone as we kun knowe any more in substance we shull send home
word. Writen at London, the xix. day of Janyvere.

   *   *   *

The meire and merchauntz of London, and the mair and merchauntz of the
staple of Caleys, were with the Chaunceller on Monday last passed[299.3]
at Lamhithe, and compleyned on the Lord Bonvile for takyng of the
shippes and godes of the Flemmynges and other of the Duke of Burgoynes
Lordships, and the Chaunceller yeve theym none answere to their plesyng;
wherfore the substaunce of theym with one voys cryed alowde, 'Justice,
justice, justice!' wherof the Chaunceller was so dismayed that he coude
ne myght no more sey to theym for fere.

    [Footnote 295.2: [Egerton MS. 914, B.M.] There is no evidence

Right worshipfull hosbond, I recommawnd me to yow, praying yow to wete

gode crafte in dawbyng; and hath seche langage to her that she thynkyt
right strange, and so that she is right wery therof, wherefor she
desyrith the rather to have a full conclusyon therinne. She seyth her
full trost is in yow, and as ye do therinne, she woll agre her therto.

    [Footnote 300.1: [From Fenn, iii. 170.] The request made at the
    end of this letter that John Paston would procure his wife an
    ornament for her neck, is noted by Fenn as one that she had made
    in April 1452, and of which this was probably a repetition nine
    months afterwards. There seems no better evidence of date to go
    by, so we follow the same mode of inference; but as we have
    placed the letter containing the first petition for the necklace
    in 1453 instead of 1452, we must attribute this letter to the
    year 1454.]

Ful mekely bisecheth your humble liege man, Walter Ingham of youre

besechere wolde in noo wyse disobeye the seide wrytyng, but that he
wolde putte hym in his devoyre to fulfill my seide Lords desyre, layde
dyvers folks arraied in maner of werre with jakkes, saletts,
langedebiefs,[302.4] and boore speres in ij. busshements for youre seide
besecher in ij. places, knowyng wele that youre seide besecher must come
oone of thes ij. weyes for, tho [_there_] were no moo, to that intent
that they [might] murdre your seide besecher be cause he had laboured
for his fadir in a wryte _sub pena_ agaynst the seide Thomas Denys and
Anneys his wyf for a notable somme of money that the seide Anneys shulde

nota[b]ly rewardet for ther laboure, and the seide Thomas shulde kepe
and save theyme harmeles. Bicause of whech comaundement oone of the
seide busshements mette with the forsaide besechere the xij. day of the
seide month, as he came toward my seide Lorde of Oxenforde acordyng to
his lettre at Dunstone afore seide, and hym than and there grevosly
bette and woundet, aswell upon his hede as uppon his leggs, and other
ful grevous strokes and many gaf hym upon his bakke, so that youre seide

so that the same besecher schulde never be content nor agreed, for the
exhorbitant offence done to hym; and also un to the tyme the seide

THOMAS DENYES TO JOHN PASTON[304.1]

_To my right wurshipfull maister, John Paston._

[Sidenote: 1454 / MARCH 20]

Right wurshipfull and myn especiall good maister, I recomaund me to you
with all service and prayer to my power. And like it you to wete that
how be a full straunge acte is passid agayn me in the Higher House
before the Lords, wherof I send you a copie. Neverthelesse I hope to God
that it shal not passe in the Comon House; but me is be falle the most
sorwfull infortune that ever por man had, standyng in suych case as I
do, for my Lordis the Cardenale and of Oxenford haf imprisoned my wif in
the countour, and how thei shal guyde hir forth, God knoweth. Which
standith to nygh myn hert, if Godds will were; but wel I know that by
thes vengeable malics don to hir and me thei wole [not?] be content,
for Ingham lithe beside that to take awey my wyves doughter out of
Westminster to make an end of my wif if he can, and also to arest my
servauntz, that I drede that she nor I shal haf no creature to attend us
ne help us; and suych malice haf I never herd of herbeforne. And it is
told me that beside that thei wole dispoil, if any good thei can fynde
of myn in Norwich or Norffolk, and imprisone my servauntz there.
Wherfore I lowly beseche your maistership, for our Lords mercy, that ye
vouchsauff to socour theym in this necessite; and if ony entree be made
or shuld be made upon myn wifes place in Norwich, that ye vouchsauff to
socour my servauntz, and do ther inne after your wisdam for Crists love
and seynt charite.

Beside this, a frend and kynnesman of myn, oon Robert Clement of Betele,
hath writen to me that he is arestid, and like to be imprisoned bi a
writte of dette, take agayn hym upon an obligacion of C_li._ [L100] in
which he and I and other wer bounde to my Lorde of Oxenford xiiij. yeer
agone, wherof I haf many acquitaunces. Wherfore I pray your good
maistership to send to the Shirreve that my said kynnesman may ben
easid, and no retourne made ageyn hym, but that he may answer the next
tyme bi attourney; for truly that writte was take oute in the end of the
terme aftir I was arestid, and aftir it was aperid to.

I pray your maistership, for Godds sake, to be not displesid, ne wery to
do for me in these materes of your charite, for I had lever gif the said
Robert suych good, litell if it be, as I haf, than he wer undone for me,
or ony man ellis that ever ded for me. And I hope, if God vouchsaf that
the mater may come to reson, to sauf hym harmles, and all other with
Godds mercy, ever prayng you of your maistership and socour for Godds
love, who ever kepe for his mercy.

Wretyn in Flete, the Wednesday the second weke of Lent.

Mor over, in augmentyng of my sorwe, I wend my wif shuld a dyed sith,
for aftir she was arestid she laboured of hir child, that she is with
all, waityng either to dye or be delyvered, and she hath not gon viij.
weks quykke. What shal be falle Almighti God knoweth, and shull dispose
mercifully.

and her servauntes in like wyse, to the uttermest distruccion of her

sche was maried be you and be my meanes, be your comaundement and

and was worth v.^c. [500] marc and better, and shuld have had a
gentilman of this contre of an C. marc of lond and wele born, ne had be

withstondyng for Godds love, my Lord, remembre how the gentilwoman is
accombred only for yowr sake, and help her; and if aught lyth in my
power to do that that myght please yowr Lordshep, or cowde fynde any way
for Water Ingham avayll and wurchep, I wull do it to my power; and the

and that longe plee is litill avayll, and every thyng must have an ende.

THOMAS DENYES TO JOHN PASTON[318.1]

_To my Maister Paston._

[Sidenote: 1454 / MAY 3]

Right reverent and wurshipfull Sir, and myn especiall good maister,
I recomaund me to you. And for as moche as oon Lord above giffeth and
takith as hym plesith, I thank His grace of every thyng; and for the
bounte that ye shew to me in this troble, I haf no spirite to thank you
as I shuld. Sir, as for certeyn evidence of myn touchyng your place in
Seint Andrues Parissh, my wif tellith me that she lefft thaym in a chest
at Ovyes shette; the key ther of she hath sent now to Ovy also. And as
for more evidence, sum is in the kepyng of Frere John Mendham, wherto I
beseche your maistership that ye wole se for the sauf and secreet kepyng
therof. God wote my wif delyvered all, myn unwetyng; ever therfore I
doute, trustyng with such hope as is be lefft me to the best, with Godds
grace.

Othre evidence of myn is at Folsham, I wote not with whome. I thank God
of my conyng; but as sone as I may know, I shal write to you. Wherfore,
sith it is thus, I beseche your maistershep disdeigne not, but for our
Lords love ye vouchsauf to take it to you, or to se that it be sauf, if
it plese you. And that ye wole send for John Maile, for I conceyve hym
right feithfull to me, and I am enfourmed that he is gretly manasid for
me. And that ye vouchsauf to do put hym in comfort that I lese not his
good wille, and that ye shew hym your good maistership and favor that he
be holpen and not hurt for me. Ferthermore, I wrote to you for such smal
thynges as I had leid to plegge to you for such good as that I borwid of
you. Wheryn I beseche your maistership that if my frends pay you
accordyng to my writyng, that ye than vouchsaf to do the said plegges be
sent hider to me by such conduyte as your wisdam like to avise, and that
they myght be here by the iiij^to die of the xv^cim[319.1] of Ester, for
than is my grettest jouparte touchyng myn imprisonement; for sith myn
enmyes coude not avail to send me to the castel of Bristow (which was
their purpose, whan thei undirstood the disposicion of the Comons Hous
agayn their billes), ever sith they make a privy labor to haf me
remevid, and I wote not whedir, ne wethir that tyme I shal be sent to
the Kynges Bench, and abide ther, or remittyd hider agayn.

Neverthelesse, if I haf releve of such pouer godes as shuld be myn by
reson, than I hope to do better, and sumwhat to aquyte, wherby I hope to
put my frends in gretter corage to do for me. And if I haf no releve,
than can I nomore, but all refere to God as I do daily. Wherefore, if ye
be not paied, I pray you to councell my said frendes to send me suche
mony as thei may gete of myn agayn that day, ever your maistership and
wisdam seyng to the conduyte therof. More over, I doute lest that
Richard Davy of his untrouth enfourme myn enmys wher such pouer thyng as
I haf is, to that intent that thei may riffel and dispoil all. Wherof,
if such case hapne, I can no ferthre, but I besech your help in every
thyng. It is yours all, ther is a dede of gifft therof to you among myn
evidence, as ye vouchsauff to do or do to be don in every thyng I holde
me content. And Al myghti God preserve you.

Wretyn in non hertis ease at Flete, the iij. day of Maii.

    [Footnote 322.2: [From Fenn, iii. 210.] This letter gives an
    account of certain proceedings for taking possession of the
    person of a minor in opposition to the claims of Paston and Sir
    John Fastolf as guardians. Fenn supposes the ward in question to
    have been Thomas Fastolf of Ipswich; but it appears, by a
    petition afterwards presented to Parliament (see _Rolls of
    Parl._ v. 371), that he was another Thomas Fastolf, viz. the son
    of John Fastolf, Esq. of Cowhawe, Suffolk, whose wardship was
    granted on the 6th June 1454 to John Paston, Esq., and Thomas
    Howes, clerk. The St. John's day mentioned in this letter is

    [Footnote 323.3: [From Fenn, i. 140.] The year in which this
    letter was written must be that of the mayoralty of Robert
    Sturmy at Bristol, as shown in p. 324, Note 2. It certainly
    could not be 1457, Fenn's date, as Lord Cromwell died in January
    1456.]

    [Footnote 324.1: James Butler, Earl of Wiltshire and Ormond. He
    was appointed Lord Treasurer of England on the 15th March 1455
    (Patent, 33 Henry VI., p. 2, m. 20), but on the 29th May
    following the office was taken from him, and given to Henry,
    Viscount Bourchier (_Ib._ m. 12). But this letter, which is
    dated in July, cannot be in 1455; indeed, we have positive
    evidence that it is in 1454. How, then, are we to explain the
    manner in which Wiltshire is referred to above? It is just
    possible--though not likely, as Wiltshire was a
    Lancastrian--that his appointment may have been enrolled in the
    wrong year, and that he was really made Lord Treasurer on the
    15th March 1454. A difference in punctuation will perhaps solve
    the difficulty best:-- 'The Lords that be appointed to keep the
    see maken hem ready yn all haste, and the Treasourer also: the
    Lord Wyltshyre for the west coast.' John Tiptoft, Earl of
    Worcester, is mentioned as Lord Treasurer on the 11th February
    1454.--See _Rolls of Parl._ v. 238.]

    [Footnote 324.2: The name was printed by Fenn 'St'myn',' and in
    the modern version on the opposite page, 'St. Myn.' Robert
    Sturmy was Mayor of Bristol in the year 1453-4. It was probably
    this very ship that was captured by the Genoese in 1457, of
    which disaster there is the following notice in the MS.
    Calendars of Bristol:-- 'Mr. Robert Sturney [_alias_ Sturmey],
    who was Mayor in 1453, had this year a ship spoiled in the
    Mediterranean Sea by the Genoese, which ship had gotten much
    wealth as having been long forth. She had spices fit to be
    planted here in England, as was reported, but the men of Genoa
    in envy spoiled her. Which wrong, when King Henry understood, he
    arrested the Genoa merchants in London, seized their goods, and
    imprisoned their persons, until they gave security to make good
    the loss; so that they were charged with L6000 indebted to Mr.
    Sturney.' --Seyer's _Memoirs of Bristol_, ii. 189.]

    [Footnote 324.3: 'The said town,' it would appear, did 'do her
    part' on the occasion; for besides this ship fitted out by the
    Mayor, Bristol subscribed L150 to a loan raised by the Duke of
    York from the seaports for the protection of trade. This sum may
    appear insignificant for a flourishing seaport; but London
    itself only subscribed L300, and Southampton, which was the next
    largest contributor, only L100, while Norwich and Yarmouth
    contributed the latter amount between them.--Seyer's _Bristol_,
    ii. 188; see also _Rolls of Parl._ v. 245. We must remember,
    however, that these sums probably represent about fifteen times
    their value in modern currency. At all events, by comparison
    with other places, Botoner had no cause to be ashamed of his
    native town.]

    [Footnote 325.1: 'Many a good man's heart he hath.' --We should
    have thought this explanation unnecessary, but that Fenn, in his
    modern version, gives the following most extraordinary
    rendering:-- 'Many a good man is hurt (_that_) he hath.']

    [Footnote 330.1: [Add. MS. 33,597, f. 5.] This letter is in the
    handwriting of William Paston, son of the judge; but the
    'Margery' Paston to whom it is addressed seems to be his brother
    John's wife, Margaret. His nephews, John Paston's sons, were at
    school in London. His sister Elizabeth, who was married to
    Robert Poynings in 1458, is here said to be upon the point of
    marriage, but no doubt this refers to the negotiations of the
    year 1454, as the eldest of John Paston's sons must have been
    sixteen in 1458. St. Laurence's day, on which the letter was
    written, is the 10th August.]

[Sidenote: 1454 / AUG. 19]

Right trusty and welbeloved, we grete yow hertily wel. And of your
benivolence, aide, and tendre love by yow, at th'instance and at the
reverence of us, to our right trusty and welbeloved in God, the prior
and convent of the hows of Our Lady of Walsingham, of our patronage, in
suche matres as they had adoo for certain lyvelood by tham claymed to
belonge unto the seid hows, favorably and tendrely shewed,--as hertily
as we can we thank yow, and desire and pray yow of your good
continuance; and as far as right, lawe, and good conscience wol, to have
in favorable recommendacion suche personnes as been or shal bee
committed to take possession and saison, in the name and to the use of
our ful worshipful nepveu, th'erl of Warrewic, in and of the manoirs and
Lordeships of Boules and Walcots,[332.1] with th'appertenauntes in Litel

God have yow in His keping.

    [Footnote 331.1: [From Fenn, i. 92.] This and the following
    letter could hardly have been written in any year except 1454 or
    1455, when the Duke of York was in power. In the former year he
    is very likely to have been at his own castle of Sandal on the
    19th August, seeing that on the 24th July he was commissioned to
    convey the Duke of Exeter to Pomfret Castle.]

    [Footnote 332.1: According to Blomefield (vii. 186), Catherine,
    widow of John Cokerell of Albergh Wykes in Suffolk, died seised
    of the manors of Walcotes and Boles in 6 Henry VI., which she
    left, with others, to Catherine, daughter of John Cokerell,
    junior, her son, who died before his father. This younger
    Catherine died a minor in 10 Henry VI., and the jury knew not
    who was her heir. In 29 Henry VI. George Heath of Mildenhall
    released to Humphrey, Duke of Buckingham, all his rights in
    Walcotes and Boles; but in the 18th of Henry VII. Christopher
    Conyers and Alice his wife conveyed it to the Heydons. Of its
    having been purchased by the Earl of Warwick or having belonged
    to the Prior of Walsingham, as stated in the next letter,
    Blomefield tells us nothing except that Richard, Earl of
    Warwick, presented to the rectory of Snoring Parva in 1460 and
    1466.]

WILLIAM WORCESTER TO JOHN PASTON[333.1]

_To my Maister Paston._

_H. R._

[Sidenote: 1454(?) / SEPT. 2]

Aftyr dewe recomendacion wyth my simple service precedyng, please your
maistershyp to wete, that as to such remembraunce that ye desyre me to
contynew forth to the uttermost, I shall wyth gode wille, so as my
maister wille licence me, as oft as I can, th'officer to hafe leysure to
be wyth me, for ye know well I can not do it alone, &c.

And where as ye of your pleasure wryte me or calle me Maister Worcestr,
I pray and requyre yow foryete that name of maistershyp, for I am not
amended by my maister of a ferthyng yn certeynte, but of wages of
housold in comune _entaunt come nows plaira_. By Worcestr or Botoner I
hafe v_s._ yerly, all costs born, to help pay for bonetts that I lose.
I told so my maister thys weke, and he seyd me yerstenday he wyshed me
to hafe be a preest, so I had be disposed, to hafe gofe me a lyvyng by
reson of a benefice, that anothyr most gefe it, as the Byshop, but he
wold; and so I endure _inter egenos ut servus ad aratrum_.

Forgefe me, I wryte to make yow laugh; and our Lord bryng my maister yn

I pray yow displeser not your servaunt be so long, for my maister lettet

    [Footnote 333.1: [From Fenn, iii. 318.] This and the next letter
    were certainly written on the same day, but the precise year may
    be questioned. From a comparison of the two together, with
    William Barker's letter of the 3rd Nov. following (No. 265),
    I am inclined to think all three belong to the year 1454, when
    Sir John Fastolf had just come to settle for the rest of his
    days in Norfolk. Sir John Fenn, I think rightly, considers this
    first letter to have been written between jest and earnest; and
    this tone may be very well explained by the supposition, that on
    Fastolf's settlement at Caister, Worcester expected to have had
    some position of importance assigned to him in his master's
    household. That such would be his fortune was probably the
    expectation of others as well as himself, and apparently John
    Paston had written to him in the belief that Worcester's
    influence with Sir John might occasionally be of value to him.]

God thank yow for your speciall remembraunce of my mater that ye hafe it

attendaunce therto yn that he can. And where ye calle hym maister, he ys
displesed wyth that name, for he may spend v_s._ yerly more by the name
of Worcestr or Botoner, and by hys maister not a ferthyng yn certeynte.
He prayth yow foryete it.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
