PREFACE


Good sir, or madam, whosoever thou mayest be, to whom this volume shall
come, cast it not aside, but read it. Its quaint, curious, and helpful
selections have been gathered through many years of careful research on
both sides of the Atlantic. They will make thee wiser and better, and
will conduce to the growth of thy mind, and the health of thy body. Let
this book be to thee a magazine of literary food, of which thou shalt
partake, and which thou shalt assimilate and digest to the constant
increase of thy well being.

The gathering of this bouquet of literary gems has been a work of

that one can say of himself is still too much."

LIFE AND LITERATURE




A


1

_Abilities_--No man's abilities are so remarkably shining, as not to
stand in need of a proper opportunity, a patron, and even the praises of
a friend, to recommend them to the notice of the world.

                                                  --_Pliny._


2

     Absence, with all its pains,
     Is by this charming moment wip'd away.


3

Abuse is the weapon of the vulgar.

                                               --_Goodrich._


4

It is told of Admiral Collingwood that on his travels he carried a bag
of acorns, and dropped one wherever there seemed a likely spot for an
oak to grow, that England might never lack ships.

                                      --_English Newspaper._


5

_Acquaintances_--It is easy to make acquaintances, but sometimes
difficult to shake them off, however irksome and unprofitable they are
found, after we have once committed ourselves to them.


6

Acquaintance softens prejudices.


7

Many persons I once thought great, dwindle into very small dimensions,
on a short acquaintance.

                                                  --_Bacon._


8

     Speak out in acts, the time for words
     Has passed, and deeds alone suffice.

                                            --_Shakespeare._


9

All may do what has by Man been done.

                                                  --_Young._


10

An act, by which we make one friend, and one enemy, is a losing game;
because revenge is a much stronger principle than gratitude.


11

All the world practices the art of acting.

                                      --_Petronius Arbiter._


12

Do what you can, when you cannot do what you would.


13

A good action performed in this world receives its recompense in the
other, just as water poured at the root of a tree appears again above in
fruit and flower.


14

If the world were to see our real motives, we should be ashamed of some
of our best actions.


15

Our actions are our own; their consequences belong to Heaven.

                                                --_Francis._


16

What thou intendest to do, speak not of, before thou doest it.


17

There is as much eloquence in the tone of voice, in the eyes, and in the
air of a speaker, as in his choice of words.

                                          --_Rochefoucauld._


18

_Actions_--What I must do, is all that concerns me, and not what people
think.

                                                --_Emerson._


19

An actor, when asked by the Archbishop of Canterbury why actors were
more successful in impressing their auditors than preachers, replied,
"Actors speak of things imaginary as if they were real, while you
preachers too often speak of things real as if they were imaginary."


20

ON LEAVING, AFTER A SHORT VISIT.

     She gazed as I slowly withdrew;
         My path I could hardly discern;
     So sweetly she bade me "adieu,"
         I thought that she bade me return.

                                           --_W. Shenstone._


21

Adversity is sometimes hard upon a man; but for one man who can stand
prosperity, there are a hundred that will stand adversity.

                                                --_Carlyle._


22

Adversity does not take from us our true friends; it only disperses
those who pretended to be so.


23

Adversity has the effect of eliciting talents, which, in prosperous
circumstances, would have lain dormant.

                                                 --_Horace._


24

He who never was acquainted with adversity, has seen the world but on
one side, and is ignorant of half the scenes of nature.


25

In prosperity the proud man knows nobody; in adversity nobody knows him.

                                 --_From Scottish-American._


26

The finest friendships have been formed in mutual adversity.

                                                  --_Latin._


27

It is a disingenuous thing to ask for _advice_, when you mean
_assistance_; and it will be a just punishment if you get that which you
pretended to want.

                                           --_Sir A. Helps._


28

Before giving advice we must have secured its acceptance, or rather,
have made it desired.

                                                  --_Amiel._


29

There is nothing more difficult than the art of making advice agreeable.


30

Every man, however wise, sometimes requires the advice of a friend in
the affairs of life.

                                                --_Plautus._


31

He who gives advice to a self-conceited man, stands himself in need of
counsel.


32

Pouring water on a duck's back. (Fruitless counsel or advice).

                                                --_Chinese._


33

Most people, when they come to you for advice, come to have their own
opinions strengthened, not corrected.


34

CLERICAL AFFECTATION.

     In man or woman, but far most in man,
     And most of all in man that ministers
     And serves the altar, in my soul I loathe
     All affectation. 'Tis my perfect scorn;
     Object of my implacable disgust.
     What! Will a man play tricks, will he indulge
     A silly fond conceit of his fair form
     And just proportion, fashionable mien,
     And pretty face, in presence of his God?
     Or will he seek to dazzle me with tropes,
     As with the diamond on his lily hand,
     And play his brilliant parts before my eyes
     When I am hungry for the bread of life?
     He mocks his Maker, prostitutes and shames
     His noble office, and, instead of truth,
     Displaying his own beauty, starves his flock.

                                                 --_Cowper._


35

_The Cure of Affectation_--Is to follow nature. If every one would do
this, affectation would be almost unknown.

                                            --_J. Beaumont._


36

Affectation of any kind, is lighting up a candle to our defects.

                                                  --_Locke._


37

Affectation is the vain and ridiculous attempt of poverty to appear
rich.

                                                --_Lavater._


38

     How sad to notice in one--changed affections,
     A cold averted eye.

                                               --_Observer._


39

AFFLICTION.

     Be still, sad heart, and cease repining,
     Behind the clouds the sun is shining;
     Thy fate is the common fate of all;
     Into each life some rain must fall--,
         Some days must be dark and dreary.

                                             --_Longfellow._


40

_Affliction_--For every sort of suffering there is sleep provided by a
gracious Providence, save that of sin.

                                              --_J. Wilson._


41

     Affliction's sons are brothers in distress;
     A brother to relieve, how exquisite the bliss!

                                                  --_Burns._


42

_Affronts_--Young men soon give, and soon forget affronts; old age is
slow in both.

                                                --_Addison._


43

Old age is a joy, when youth has been well spent.


44

THE APPROACH OF AGE.

     Six years had passed, and forty ere the six,
     When time began to play his usual tricks;
     The locks once comely in a virgin's sight,
     Locks of pure brown, displayed the encroaching white;
     The blood, once fervid, now to cool began,
     And Time's strong pressure to subdue the man.
     I rode or walked as I was wont before,
     But now the bounding spirit was no more;
     A moderate pace would now my body heat,
     A walk of moderate length distress my feet.
     I showed my stranger guest those hills sublime,
     But said, "The view is poor, we need not climb."
     At a friend's mansion I began to dread
     The cold neat parlor and gay glazed bed;
     At home I felt a more decided taste,
     And must have all things in my order placed.
     I ceased to hunt; my horses pleased me less--
     My dinner more; I learned to play at chess.
     I took my dog and gun, but saw the brute
     Was disappointed that I did not shoot.
     My morning walks I now could bear to lose,
     And blessed the shower that gave me not to choose.
     In fact, I felt a languor stealing on;
     The active arm, the agile hand, were gone;
     Small daily actions into habits grew,
     And new dislike to forms and fashions new.
     I loved my trees in order to dispose;
     I numbered peaches, looked how stocks arose;
     Told the same story oft--in short, began to prose.

                                          --_George Crabbe._


45

Age is a matter of feeling, not of years.

                                             _G. W. Curtis._


46

Men are as old as they feel, and women as they look.

                                                  _Italian._


47

     May you all be as old as I,
         And see your sons to manhood grow;
     And many a time before you die,
         Be just as pleased as I am now.

                                             --_Bloomfield._


48

Old age and faded flowers, no remedies can revive.

                                                --_Chinese._


49

     'Twas impious then (so much was age rever'd)
     For youth to keep their seats when an old man appear'd.


50

Goethe said: "It is only necessary to grow old to become more indulgent.
I see no fault committed that I have not committed myself."


51

     The young are fond of novelty,
     The old of custom.


52

     Speak gently to the aged one,
         Grieve not the care-worn heart;
     The sands of life are nearly run--
         Let such in peace depart!


53

Elderly people look back upon the friends, relatives and acquaintances
of thirty, forty or fifty years ago, and say, "There are no friends
now-a-days like the old friends of long ago." It is natural for them to
think this way, particularly when most of the old friends are dead; but
the fact is, that there are friends as true now as ever.


54

     These are the effects of doting age,
     Vain doubts, and idle cares, and over-caution.

                                                 --_Dryden._


55

Do you seek Alcides' equal? There is none but himself.

                                                 --_Seneca._


56

EVIDENTLY UNSATISFACTORY.

"When I look at my congregation," said a London preacher, "I say, 'Where
are the poor?' When I count the offertory in the vestry I say, 'Where
are the rich?'"


57

ALMSGIVING.

At table, discussing with some friends the subject of raffles, Bishop
Wescott said that he objected to them as part of the gambling question,
and also on wider grounds. He objected to all the "side means" which
were sometimes combined with sales of work for "getting money out of
people." Such money, he thought, as distinct from that which is given,
was not wanted nor acceptable.

                                --_The Contemporary Review._


58

     What stamps the wrinkles deepest on the brow,
     It is to be alone, as I am now!


59

The following Hawaiian alphabet, consisting of twelve letters, was in
use, and had been for something like a hundred years, when the compiler
visited the Islands in 1886. It was given to the Hawaiians by the
missionaries, viz.:

     a, e, i, o, u, h, k, l, m, n, p, w.

THE AMBITIOUS MAN.

A slave has but _one master_; the _ambitious man_ has as _many masters_
as there are persons whose aid may contribute to the advancement of his
_fortune_.

                                             --_La Bruyere._

THE QUEST OF ANCESTORS.

     "Of all the notable things on earth,
      The queerest one is pride of birth."

A few years ago a well-known Bostonian, the descendant of an honored
family, began the ancestral quest with expert assistance. All went merry
as a marriage bell for a time, when suddenly he unearthed an unsavory
scandal that concerned one of his progenitors. Feeling a responsibility
for the misdeeds of his great-grandfather, he ordered all investigation
stopped, and the disagreeable data destroyed; but he had delved too far.
His genealogist had told a friend, and the secret was out beyond recall.

MERIT FROM ANCESTORS.

     Were honor to be scann'd by long descent
     From ancestors illustrious, I could vaunt
     A lineage of the greatest; and recount,
     Among my fathers, names of ancient story,
     Heroes and god-like patriots, who subdu'd
     The world by arms and virtue.
     But that be their own praise;
     Nor will I borrow merit from the dead,
     Myself an undeserver.

HIS CREATURES.

The daughter of an army officer, whose life had been spent in the far
west, told the following anecdote: "Indians, when they accept
Christianity, very often hold its truths with peculiar simplicity.

"There was near our fort an old chief called Tassorah. One day, when I
was an impulsive girl, I was in a rage at my pony, and dismounting, beat
him severely. The old man stood by, silent for a moment.

"'What words have I heard from Jesus?' he said, sternly. 'If you love
not your brother whom you have seen, how can you love God whom you have
not seen?'

"'This horse is not my brother!' I said scornfully.

"The old man laid his hand on the brute's head and turned it toward me.
The eyes were full of terror.

"'Is not God his creator? Must He not care for him?' he said. 'Not a
sparrow falls to the ground without His notice.'

"I never forgot the lesson. It flashed on me then for the first time
that the dog that ran beside me, the birds, the very worms were His, and
I, too, was one of His great family."


82

Kindness to animals is no unworthy exercise of benevolence. We hold that
the life of brutes perishes with their breath, and that they are never
to be clothed again with consciousness. The inevitable shortness then of
their existence should plead for them touchingly. The insects on the
surface of the water, poor ephemeral things, who would needlessly
abridge their dancing pleasure of to-day? Such feelings we should have
towards the whole animate creation.

                                       --_Sir Arthur Helps._

THE GRACIOUS ANSWER.

(The first half of each stanza should be subdued; the last half
confident and full of assurance.)

     The way is dark, my Father! Cloud on cloud
     Is gathering thickly o'er my head, and loud
     The thunders roar above me. See, I stand
     Like one bewildered! Father, take my hand,
                   And through the gloom
                   Lead safely home
                         Thy child!
     The way is dark, my child! But leads to light.
     I would not always have thee walk by sight.
     My dealings now thou canst not understand.
     I meant it so; but I will take thy hand,
                   And through the gloom
                   Lead safely home
                         My child!
     The day goes fast, my Father! And the night
     Is growing darkly down. My faithless sight
     Sees ghostly visions. Fears, a spectral band,
     Encompass me. O Father! Take my hand,
                   And from the night
                   Lead up to light
                         Thy child!
     The day goes fast, my child! But is the night
     Darker to me than Day? In me is light!
     Keep close to me, and every spectral band
     Of fears shall vanish. I will take thy hand,
                   And through the night
                   Lead up to light
                         My child!
     The way is long, my Father! And my soul
     Longs for the rest and quiet of the goal;
     While yet I journey through this weary land,
     Keep me from wandering. Father, take my hand;
                   Quickly and straight
                   Lead to Heaven's gate
                         Thy child!
     The way is long, my child! But it shall be
     Not one step longer than is best for thee;
     And thou shalt know, at last, when thou shalt stand
     Safe at the goal, how I did take thy hand,
                   And quick and straight
                   Lead to Heaven's gate
                         My child!
     The path is rough, my Father! Many a thorn
     Has pierced me; and my weary feet, all torn
     And bleeding, mark the way. Yet Thy command
     Bids me press forward. Father, take my hand;
                   Then, safe and blest,
                   Lead up to rest
                         Thy child!
     The path is rough, my child! But oh! how sweet
     Will be the rest, for weary pilgrims meet,
     When thou shalt reach the borders of that land
     To which I lead thee, as I take thy hand;
                   And safe and blest
                   With me shall rest
                         My child!
     The throng is great, my Father! Many a doubt,
     And fear and danger, compass me about;
     And foes oppress me sore. I can not stand
     Or go alone. O Father! take my hand,
                   And through the throng
                   Lead safe along
                         Thy child!
     The throng is great, my child! But at thy side
     Thy Father walks; then be not terrified,
     For I am with thee; will thy foes command
     To let thee freely pass;--will take thy hand,
                   And through the throng
                   Lead safe along
                         My child!
     The cross is heavy, Father! I have borne
     It long, and still do bear it. Let my worn
     And fainting spirit rise to that blest land
     Where crowns are given. Father, take my hand;
                   And reaching down
                   Lead to the crown
                         Thy child!
     The cross is heavy, child! Yet there was One
     Who bore a heavier cross for thee; my Son,
     My well-beloved. For Him bear thine; and stand
     With Him at last; and from thy Father's hand,
                   Thy cross laid down,
                   Receive a crown,
                         My child!

APPEARANCES OFTEN MISUNDERSTOOD.

     Sometimes our estimate of men and women
     On short acquaintance is very much at fault.

A gentleman and his wife--Pierrepont by name--passengers on one of the
great Atlantic steamers, not knowing any of the other passengers, kept
very much to themselves; he usually reading aloud to his wife, and she
occupied in some needle work; for this, they were commented upon, and
not very favorably, and generally were called the "stupid couple."
Little did these same passengers know the true character of that
gentleman and lady. An incident that occurred on board soon proved the
bravery and heroism of the one, and the gentleness and self-sacrifice of
the other. The captain had with him his only son, a boy of some eight
summers, a great favorite of all on board from fore to aft. The little
fellow, climbing on the side of the ship, somehow fell overboard. The
lady happening to be on the other side of the deck, saw the child climb
up, and immediately missed him. She quickly laid her hand on her
husband's shoulder, looking in his eyes, and cried out, "Oh, save the
boy, he has fallen overboard." In one moment he was on his feet, kicked
off his canvas shoes, threw his hat on the deck, and turning his face
toward the bridge, where he knew some of the ship's officers were always
stationed, he called out in a voice which rang like a trumpet call over
the ship, "Man overboard." Then, with a quick run and leap, he cleared
the rail, and the broken twisting water of the ship's track had closed
over him. He was on the surface again in a moment, and taking a glance
back at the ship to know his position, stretched out into a long steady
stroke in the direction where he knew the child was.

Instantly the captain's hand was on the engine-room telegraph, and down
into the depths of the ship went the signals. First to "stop," and the
tremor all over the ship ceased. The bell rang again, and the index
moved to "astern-slow;" then in a minute or two, to, "half;" then he
called out to the second officer--"Man overboard! Stand by to lower away
the gig," which was quickly obeyed, and four hands, a coxswain, and a
man for the boat's bow were instantly off and rowed fiercely.

In a little while Mrs. Pierrepont--who was on the bridge with Captain
Hood--said, "Do you see them; are they together?"

"Yes," replied the captain, "I believe they are." But his voice was now
broken, and he took hold of Mrs. Pierrepont's hand. "I have watched my
child from here with the glass, till at last he floated so low that I
could scarcely see him, and just as he seemed sinking your husband
dashed across the spot where he was, and I saw by a wave of his hand
towards the ship that he caught him. He is now waiting for the boat."

It was getting dark when they returned. The child, who was shivering,
was immediately carried away to have a warm bath, and a little later was
in the saloon with dry clothes on, as merry as if nothing had happened.

When Pierrepont stepped on the deck, a rush was made at him, and both
hands were shaken till he thought his arms would be pulled off.

The captain said all he had to say in a very few words, and with a
hand-grasp which said more than words.

BEAUTIFUL.

     The beautiful are never desolate,
     For some one always loves them.


101

     Beauty of face is but a fleeting dower,
     A momentary gleam, a short-lived flower,
     A charm that goes no deeper than the skin;
     Beauty of mind is firm enthroned within.


102

There is the beauty of infancy, the beauty of youth, the beauty of
maturity, and, believe me, ladies and gentlemen, the beauty of age.

105

FRAGILE IS BEAUTY.

     Fragile is beauty: with advancing years
     'Tis less and less, and, last, it disappears.
     Your hair too, fair one, will turn grey and thin;
     And wrinkles furrow that now rounded skin;
     Then brace the mind and thus beauty fortify,
     The mind alone is yours, until you die.


106

Beauty without kindness dies unenjoyed and undelighting.

The kindest benefactors have no recollection of the good they do, and

He who receives a benefit should never forget it; he who bestows one
should never remember it.

To act always from pure benevolence is not possible for finite beings.
Human benevolence is mingled with vanity, interest, or some other
motive.

The following lines of Sir Walter Scott are said to have been copied in
his Bible:

     Within this awful volume lies
     The mystery of mysteries.
     Oh! happiest they of human race,
     To whom our God has given grace
     To hear, to read, to fear, to pray,
     To lift the latch, and force the way;
     But better had they ne'er been born
     Who read to doubt, or read to scorn.

Remember, that in prayer, you are speaking to God; that in reading the
Bible, God is speaking to you.

FACTS ABOUT THE BIBLE.

The learned prince of Grenada, heir to the Spanish throne, imprisoned by
order of the Crown for fear he would aspire to the throne, was kept in
solitary confinement in the old prison at the Palace of Skulls, Madrid.
After thirty-three years in this living tomb, death came to his release,
and the following remarkable researches, taken from the Bible, and
marked with an old nail on the rough walls of his cell, told how the
brain sought employment through the weary years.

     The 35th verse, 11th chapter of John, is the shortest.

     The 9th verse of the 8th chapter of Esther is the longest.

     The 8th verse of the 97th Psalm is the middle verse of the
     Bible.

     Each verse in Psalm 136 ends alike.

     The 37th chapter of Isaiah and 19th chapter of 2d Kings are
     alike.

     The word "girl" occurs but once in the Bible, and that in
     Joel, 3d chapter and 3d verse.

     The word "Lord" is found 1853 times, the word "Jehovah" 6855
     times, the word "reverend" but once, and that in Psalms 111th
     chapter and 9th verse.

     The four most inspiring promises are in John, 14th chapter,
     2d verse, 6th chapter and 37th verse; Matthew, 11th chapter
     and 28th verse, and in Psalms, 37th chapter and 4th verse.

     The finest chapter is in Acts, 26th.

THE BIBLE.

Who, coming to this sacred book, with a sincere desire to know God's
will for the direction of his life, will say that he can not find it?
Who, desiring to be instructed in the way of salvation "through faith
which is in Christ Jesus," will consult its pages, and say it is not
made plain to him? Who, coming to it for equipment of his spiritual
life, will say that there are still needs of that life which are left
unprovided for? Who, seeking direction in the way of the life
everlasting, can doubt that, if he faithfully obeys its teaching, he
will reach that goal? The Scripture fulfils the ends for which it was
given; no higher proof of its inspiration can be demanded. * * * * *
What the closing verse of the 20th chapter of John's Gospel says of that
book: "But these are written, that ye may believe that Jesus is the
Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye may have life through His
name," may with equal truth be applied to the Bible as a whole.

GOOD BOOK-KEEPERS.

Sir Walter Scott, in lending a book one day to a friend, cautioned him
to be punctual in returning it. "This is really necessary," said the
poet in apology; "for though many of my friends are bad
_arithmeticians_, I observe almost all of them to be good
_book-keepers_."

AN EXPERIENCE AND A MORAL.

     I lent my love a book one day;
         She brought it back; I laid it by:
     'Twas little either had to say,--
         She was so strange, and I so shy.

     But yet we loved indifferent things,--
         The sprouting buds, the birds in tune,--
     And Time stood still and wreathed his wings
         With rosy links from June to June.

     For her, what task to dare or do?
         What peril tempt? What hardship bear?
     But with her--ah! she never knew
         My heart, and what was hidden there!

     And she with me, so cold and coy,
         Seemed like a maid bereft of sense;
     But in the crowd, all life and joy,
         And full of blushful impudence.

     She married,--well, a woman needs
         Someone, her life and love to share,--
     And little cares sprang up like weeds
         And played around her elbow-chair.

     Years rolled by--and I, content,
         Trimmed my own lamp, and kept it bright,
     Till age's touch, my hair besprent
         With rays and gleams of silver light.

     And then it chanced I took the book
         Which she perused in days gone by;
     And as I read, such passion shook,
         That, I needs must surely cry.

     For, here and there, her love was writ,
         In old, half-faded pencil-signs,
     As if she yielded--bit by bit--
         Her heart in dots and underlines.

     Ah, silvered fool, too late you look!
         I know it; but let me here record
     This maxim: Lend no girl a book
         Unless you read it afterward!

We should make the same use of a book that the bee does of a flower; she

Be as careful of the books you read, as of the company you keep; for
your habits and character will be as much influenced by the former as
the latter.

BOOKS.

     If thou art borrowed by a friend,
         Right welcome shall he be,
     To read, to study, not to lend,
         But to return to me.

     Not that imparted knowledge doth
         Diminish learning's store;
     But books, I find, if often lent,
         Return to me no more.

BOOKS.

The feeling that books are real friends is constantly present to all who
love reading. "I have friends," said Petrarch, "whose society is
extremely agreeable to me, they are of all ages, and of every country.
They have distinguished themselves both in the cabinet and in the field,
and obtained high honors for their knowledge of the sciences. It is easy
to gain access to them, for they are always at my service, and I admit
them to my company, and dismiss them from it, whenever I please. They
are never troublesome, but immediately answer every question I ask them.
Some relate to me the events of past ages, while others reveal to me the
secrets of Nature. Some teach me how to live, and others how to die.
Some, by their vivacity, drive away my cares and exhilarate my spirits;
while others give fortitude to my mind, and teach me the important
lesson how to deport myself, and to depend wholly on myself. They open
to me, in short, the various avenues of all the arts and sciences and
upon their information I may safely rely in all emergencies. In return
for all their services, they only ask me to accommodate them with a
convenient chamber in some corner of my humble habitation where they may
repose in peace; for these friends are more delighted by the tranquility
of retirement than with the tumults of society."

                                               --_Petrarch._


134

BOOKS.

Books introduce us into the best society; they bring us into the
presence of the greatest minds that have ever lived. We hear what they
said and did; we see them as if they were really alive; we are
participators in their thoughts; we sympathize with them, enjoy with
them, grieve with them; their experience becomes ours, and we feel as if
we were in a measure actors with them in the scenes which they describe.


135

BOOK-LENDING.

Those who have collected books, and whose good nature has prompted them
to accommodate their friends with them, will feel the sting of the
answer made by a man of wit to one who lamented the difficulty which he
found in persuading his friends to return the volumes that he had lent
them:

"Sir," said he, "your acquaintances find, I suppose, that it is much
more easy to retain the books themselves, than what is contained in
them."


136

The following gives a pathetic description of a studious boy lingering
at a bookstall:

      I saw a boy with eager eye
      Open a book upon a stall,
      And read, as he'd devour it all;
      Which, when the stall-man did espy,
      Soon to the boy I heard him call,
     "You, sir, you never buy a book,
      Therefore in one you shall not look."
      The boy passed slowly on, and with a sigh
      He wished he never had been taught to read,
      Then of the old churl's books he should have had no need.

                                              --_Mary Lamb._


137

Books that you may carry to the fire, and hold readily in your hand, are
the most useful after all. A man will often look at them, and be tempted
to go on, when he would have been frightened at books of a larger size
and of a more erudite appearance.

                                            --_Dr. Johnson._


138

COSTLY, YET USEFUL BOOKS.

How foolish is the man who sets up a number of costly volumes, like
superfluous furniture, for mere ornament, and is far more careful to
keep them from contracting a single spot of ink, than to use them, as
the means of instructing his ignorance, and correcting his faults!
Better a man without books, than books without a man.

"My boy," said a father to his son, "treat everybody with politeness,
even those who are rude to you, for remember that you show courtesy to
others, not because they are gentlemen, but because you are one."

GRACEFUL AND GALLANT.

It is reasonably safe to assume from a story in the New York Tribune
that the late Henry Harland, the novelist, was seldom kept after school
in his boyhood.

Among Harland's early teachers was a charming young lady, who called him
up in class one morning and said to him:

"Henry, name some of the chief beauties of education."

"Schoolmistresses," the boy answered, smiling into his teacher's pretty
eyes.

144

John Ruskin, in one of his lectures, said: "There is just this
difference between the making of a girl's character and a boy's: You may
chisel a boy into shape as you would a rock, or hammer him into it, if
he be of a better kind, as you would a piece of bronze; but you can not
hammer a girl into anything. She grows as a flower does--she will wither
without sun; she will decay in her sheath as a narcissus will if you do
not give her air enough; she must take her own fair form and way if she
take any, and in mind as in body, must have always--

     "'Her household motions light and free,
       And steps of virgin liberty.'"

You bring up your girls as if they were meant for sideboard ornaments,
and then complain of their frivolity. Give them the same advantages
that you give their brothers; teach them, that courage and truth are the
pillars of their being.

Again: "The man's work for his own home, is to secure its maintenance,
progress, and defence; the woman's to secure its order, comfort, and
loveliness.

"What the man is at his own gate, defending it if need be, against
insult and spoil, that also, not in a less, but in a more devoted
measure, he is to be at the gate of his country, leaving his home, if
need be, even to the spoiler, to do his more incumbent work there.

"And in like manner what the woman is to be within her gates, as the
centre of order, the balm of distress, and the mirror of beauty, that
she is also to be without her gates, where order is more difficult,
distress more imminent, loveliness more rare."

You can lead a boy to college, but you can't make him think.

PARENTAL AUTHORITY.

     "O say! What is that thing call'd light,
          Which I must ne'er enjoy?
      What are the blessings of the sight?
          O, tell your poor blind boy!

      You talk of wond'rous things you see,
          You say the sun shines bright;
      I feel him warm, but how can he
          Make it day or night?

      With heavy sighs I often hear
          You mourn my hapless woe;
      But sure with patience I can bear
          A loss I ne'er can know.

      Then let not what I can not have
          My cheer of mind destroy;
      Whilst thus I sing, I am a king,
          Although a poor blind boy."

THE ORPHAN BOY'S TALE.

      Stay, lady, stay, for mercy's sake,
          And hear a helpless orphan's tale,
      Ah! sure my looks must pity wake,
          'Tis want that makes my cheek so pale.
      Yet I was once a mother's pride,
          And my brave father's hope and joy;
      But in the Nile's proud fight he died,
          And I am now an orphan boy.

      Poor foolish child! how pleased was I
          When news of Nelson's victory came,
      Along the crowded streets to fly,
          And see the lighted windows flame!
      To force me home my mother sought,
          She could not bear to see my joy;
      For with my father's life 'twas bought,
          And made me a poor orphan boy.

      The people's shouts were long and loud,
          My mother, shuddering, closed her ears;
     "Rejoice! rejoice!" still cried the crowd;
          My mother answered with her tears.
     "Why are you crying thus," said I,
         "While others laugh and shout with joy?"
      She kissed me--and with such a sigh!
          She called me "her poor orphan boy."

_Climate_--The climate of Great Britain, as that of no other country in
a like latitude, derives its peculiarity from its situation and from the
prevailing winds, which are from the southwest, except in the months of
April and May. The thermometer for six months in the year averages near
60 degrees, and seldom, if ever, drops below 36 degrees during the
remaining six months, thus affording, according to all authorities, one
of the healthiest climates in the world.

_A Saying of Napoleon_--Once at St. Helena, when walking with a lady,
some servants came along carrying a load. The lady, in an angry tone,
ordered them out of the way, on which Napoleon interposed, saying,
"Respect the burden, madam." Even the drudgery of the humblest laborer
contributes towards the general well-being of society; and it was a wise
saying of a Chinese Emperor that, "If there was a man who did not work,
or a woman that was idle, somebody must suffer cold or hunger in the
Empire."

WHAT WE OWE TO ROBERT BURNS.

Burns has been one of the world awakeners. His voice rang out of the
stillness, like the clear sweet notes of a bugle horn, and his songs
were sung with a nerve and strength of nature that stirred to its depths
the popular heart.

Describing Robert Burns' conversational gifts, Mr. Carlyle wrote: "They
were the theme of all that ever heard him. All kinds of gifts, from the
gracefullest allusions of courtesy to the highest fire of passionate
speech, loud floods of mirth, soft wailings of affection, laconic
emphasis, clear piercing insight, all were in him."

He awoke the poor and the despised to the dignity of man as man,
irrespective of the accidents of poverty or wealth.

     "The rank is but the guinea's stamp,
      The man's the man for a' that."

Thus helping to deliver men from the debasing worship of sordid gold,
and of such rank as kings can confer on even the most worthless.

     "The man of independent mind
      He looks and laughs at a' that."

He opened the eyes of the Scottish people, at home and abroad, to the
glory of their nation's history, and glowing with the hope of a day--

     "When man to man the world o'er
      Shall brithers be for a' that."

He also opened men's eyes to the hatefulness of all shams and
hypocrisies; of meanness, selfishness and pride; of all narrowness and
greed and cruelty thus--

     "Man's inhumanity to man
      Makes countless thousands mourn."

And again: He opened men's eyes to the cruelty and injustice of harsh
judgment, seen oftenest perhaps in people judging, or misjudging others,
who have yielded to temptations, or sunk under debasing influences, to
which they themselves have never been exposed. Where has Christian
charity and kindly consideration for others been more nobly taught than
in these lines:

     "Who made the heart, 'tis He alone
          Decidedly can try us;
      He knows each chord, its various tone,
          Each spring, its various bias.
      Then, at the balance, let's be mute,
          We never can adjust it;
      What's done we partly may compute,
          But know not what's resisted."

He opened many eyes when he wrote the following:

     "O, wad some Pow'r the giftie gie us
      To see oursels as ithers see us!
      It wad frae monie a blunder free us,
            And foolish notion;
      What airs in dress an' gait wad lea'e us,
            And even Devotion!"

LONDON MISSIONARY SOCIETY.

Dr. Chalmers of Scotland, arrived in London, on the 13th of May, 1817,
and on the following day preached in Surrey Chapel, the anniversary
sermon for the London Missionary Society. Although the service did not
commence till eleven o'clock, at seven in the morning the chapel was
crowded to excess, and many thousands went off for want of room. He rose
and gave out his text from 1 Cor. xiv, 22-25. He had not proceeded many
minutes till his voice gradually expanded in strength and compass,
reaching every part of the house and commanding universal attention.
His sermon occupied about an hour and a half in the delivery. A
gentleman wrote to a friend: "I have just heard and witnessed the most
astonishing display of human talent that perhaps ever commanded hearing;
all my expectations were overwhelmed in the triumph of it."

At an afternoon service he preached in the Scotch Church, in Swallow
Street. On approaching the church, Dr. Chalmers and a friend found so
dense a mass within, and before the building, as to give no hope of
effecting an entrance by the mere force of ordinary pressure. Lifting
his cane and gently tapping the heads of those who were in advance, Dr.
Chalmers' friend exclaimed, "Make way there, make way please, for Dr.
Chalmers." The sturdy Londoners refused to move, believing it was a
ruse. Forced to retire, Dr. Chalmers retreated from the outskirts of the
crowd, crossed the street, stood for a few moments gazing on the growing
tumult, and had almost resolved altogether to withdraw, as access by any
of the ordinary entrances was impossible. At last a plank was projected
from one of the windows very near the pulpit, till it rested on an iron
palisade, and the Doctor and others gained entrance. The impression
produced by the service which followed, when all had at last settled
down into stillness, was deeper than that made by any of those which
preceded it.

BROTHER AND SISTER.

In a village churchyard in England, there is the following epitaph. It
is there applied to a husband; but, by altering a single word, it can be
made to apply to brother, sister, or comrade; and the one who fulfils
all that is implied in the praise, is surely a most admirable character:

     "He was--
      But words are wanting to say what;
      Think what a husband should be.
                            He was that."

The sun has some spots on his surface, and the best and brightest
characters are not without their faults and frailties.

The crown jewel of character is sincerity.

An appearance of delicacy is inseparable from sweetness and gentleness
of character.

THE UPRIGHT CHARACTER.

     He is not just who doth no wrong, but he
     Who will not when he may; not he who, lured
     By some poor petty prize, abstains, but he
     Who with some mighty treasure in his grasp
     May sin securely, yet abhors the sin.
     Not he who closely skirts the pale of law,
     But he whose generous nature, void of guile--
           Would be,
                 Not seem to be,
                       The upright man.

As daylight can be seen through very small holes, so little things will

CHARACTER SHOULD NOT BE BELOW HOME STANDARD.

Alexander Simpson, the elder brother of Sir James Simpson, watched over
the boyhood of the latter with parental care. When the social usages of
the town and the prevalent free mode of living presented strong
temptations to the boy, Alexander would put his arm round his neck and
tenderly warn him: "Others may do this, but it would break a' our hearts
and blast a' your prospects were ye to do it." After one such warning,
"Jamie was greatly troubled, and cried nearly a' the nicht (night) like
to break his heart." He obeyed the warning, and became a celebrated
physician in Edinburgh.


201

LITTLE THINGS.

Small kindnesses, small courtesies, small considerations, habitually
practiced in our social intercourse, give a greater charm to the
character than the display of great talents and accomplishments.

Oaths are not the cause why a man is believed, but the character of a

great strength of character.

CHARITY--IN WORD ONLY.

When thy brother has lost all that he ever had, and lies languishing,
and even gasping under the utmost extremities of poverty and distress,
dost thou think to lick him whole again only with thy tongue?

213

CHARITY.

     That charity begins at home is true,
     Yet this is rightly understood by few.
     But, lest you should not easily discern,
     I counsel you, my friends, this lesson learn;
     The home of charity is a mind possess'd
     Of wishes to relieve whoe'er's distress'd;
     In town, or country, or on foreign shore,
     She's ne'er from home when pity's at the door.


214

CHARITY.

Be not frightened at the hard words "imposition," "imposture;" give and
ask no questions. "Cast thy bread upon the waters." Some have, unawares,
entertained angels.

                                                   --_Lamb._

As charity covers a multitude of sins before God, so does politeness
before men.

217

Where there is plenty, charity is a duty, not a courtesy.

                                                --_Feltham._

We step up, when we stoop down, to help the needy.

CHARITY--INGRATITUDE FOR.

Did you ever see the horses taken to water? They rush into some
beautiful stream, and drink of it to their heart's content; after which
they turn their backs upon it, or stamp in it with their feet, until the
water is polluted. This is the price they pay for their refreshing
draught. But what, then does the noble river? It immediately floats away
the mud, and continues after, as it was before, full and free of access
for the same or other thirsty creatures. And so must you also do. If
there be a fountain of genuine charity in your heart, it will
constantly, and spontaneously overflow, whether those who drink of it
are thankful or not. This life is the season for sowing and scattering;
we shall reap hereafter.


220

Give freely to him that deserveth well, and asketh nothing.


221

INASMUCH.

     I asked for alms!
     He flung a coin at me
     Contemptuously.
     Not without sense of shame
     I stooped and picked it up.
     Does this fulfil
     The Master's will
     To give a cup
     Of water in His Name?

     I asked for bread!
     He handed out to me
     Indifferently
     A ticket for some food.
     It answered to my need.
     Was this the way
     On that great day
     Christ stopped to feed
     The hungry multitude?

     When we shall wait,
     After this mortal strife,
     Eternal life,
     And to His presence go
     As suppliants indeed,
     Will it be thus
     He will on us
     In our great need
     His priceless gift bestow?

                                            --_The Outlook._


222

It is charity not to excite a hope, when it must end in disappointment.


223

When you see a man in distress, acknowledge him at once your fellow man.
Recollect that he is formed of the same materials, with the same
feelings as yourself, and then relieve him as you yourself would wish to
be relieved.


224

_Leviticus, xxv, 35._--"And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in
decay with thee, then thou shalt relieve him; yea, though he be a
stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with thee."

Mr. H----, an ingenious artist, being driven out of all employment, and
reduced to great distress, had no resource to which to apply except that
of an elder brother, who was in good circumstances. To him, therefore,
he applied, and begged some little hovel to live in, and some small
provision for his support. The brother melted into tears, and said,
"You, my dear brother! You live in a hovel! You are a man; you are an
honor to the family. I am nothing. You shall take this house and the
estate, and I will be your guest, if you please." The brothers lived
together without its being distinguishable who was proprietor of the
estate, till the death of the elder put the artist in possession of it.


225

UNAWARES.

      They said, "The Master is coming
          To honor the town to-day,
      And none can tell what house or home
          He may choose wherein to stay."
      Then straight I turned to toiling,
          To make my home more neat;
      I swept and polished and garnished,
          And decked it with blossoms sweet.

      But right in the midst of my duties
          A woman came to my door;
      She had come to tell me her sorrow,
          And my comfort and aid to implore.
      And I said, "I can not listen,
          Nor help you any to-day;
      I have greater things to attend to."
          So the pleader turned away.

      But soon there came another--
          A cripple, thin, pale and gray--
      And said, "O let me stop and rest
          Awhile in your home I pray."
      I said, "I am grieved and sorry,
          But I can not keep you to-day;
      I look for a great and noble guest."
          And the cripple went away.

      And the day wore onward swiftly,
          And my task was nearly done,
      And a prayer was ever in my heart
          That the Master to me might come.

      I thought I would spring to meet Him,
          And treat Him with utmost care,
      When a little child stood by me
          With a face so sweet and fair--
      Sweet, but with marks of tear drops--
          And his clothes were tattered old;
      A finger was bruised and bleeding,
          And his little bare feet were cold.

      And I said, "I am sorry for you:
          You are sorely in need of care,
      But I can not stop to give it;
          You must hasten other where."
      And at the words a shadow
          Swept over his blue-veined brow.
     "Some one will feed and clothe you, dear,
          But I am too busy now."

      At last, my toil was over and done,
      My house was swept and garnished,
          And I watched in the dusk alone;
      I waited till night had deepened,
          And the Master had not come;
     "He has entered some other door," I cried,
         "And gladdened some other home!"

      Then the Master stood before me,
          And His face was grave and fair;
     "Three times to-day I came to your door,
          And craved your pity and care.
      Three times you sent Me onward,
          Unhelped and uncomforted;
      And the blessing you might have had was lost,
          And your chance to serve has fled."

     "O Lord, dear Lord, forgive me;
          How could I know it was Thee?"
      My very soul was shamed and bowed
          In the depths of humility.
      And He said, "The sin is pardoned,
          But the blessing is lost to thee,
      For failing to comfort the least of Mine,
          You have failed to comfort Me."


226

John Paul, of Siena, was always very liberal to the poor. On his
deathbed he exclaimed, "What I have kept, that have I lost, and what I
have given away, that I have yet, what I have refused I now regret."

Another is reported to have said: "I have lost everything except what I
have given away."


227

A SERMON OF MOHAMMED.

When God made the earth, it shook to and fro till He put mountains on it
to keep it firm. Then the angels asked, "O God, is there anything in Thy
creation stronger than these mountains?" And God replied, "Iron is
stronger than the mountains, for it breaks them." "And is there anything
in Thy creation stronger than iron?" "Yes, fire is stronger than iron,
for it melts it." "Is there anything stronger than fire?" "Yes, water,
for it quenches fire." "Is there anything stronger than water?" "Yes,
wind, for it puts water in motion." "O, our Sustainer, is there anything
in Thy creation stronger than wind?" "Yes, a good man giving alms; if he
gives it with his right hand, and conceals it from his left, he
overcomes all things." Every good act is charity; your smiling in your
brother's face, your putting a wanderer in the right road, your giving
water to the thirsty is charity; exhortation to another to do right is
charity. A man's true wealth hereafter is the good he has done in this
world to his fellowmen. When he dies, people will ask: "What property
has he left behind him?" But the angels will ask: "What good deeds has
he sent before him?"

_Charity_--It is another's fault if he be ungrateful; but it is mine if
I do not give. To find one thankful man, I will oblige many that are not

A CHILD'S SERMON.

A writer once told how a little child preached a sermon to him.

"Is your father at home?" I asked a small child at our village doctor's
doorstep.

"No," she said, "he's away."

"Where do you think I could find him?"

"Well," she said, with a considering air, "you've got to look for some
place where people are sick or hurt, or something like that. I don't
know where he is, but he's helping somewhere."


238

A SLEEPING CHILD.

How happy are thy days! How sweet thy repose! How calm thy rest! Thou
slumberest upon the earth more soundly than many a miser and worldling
upon his bed of down. And the reason is--that thou hast a gracious God
and an easy conscience. A stranger to all care, thou awakest only to
resume thy play, or ask for food to satisfy thy hunger.


239

A full-blown rose besprinkled with the purest dew, is not so beautiful
as a child blushing beneath her parents' displeasure, and shedding tears
of sorrow for her fault.


240

A torn jacket is soon mended; but hard words bruise the heart of a
child.

own. In prayer, how earnest! In joy, how sparkling! In sympathy, how

INSCRIPTION ON MY LITTLE SON'S SILVER PLATE.

     When thou dost eat from off this plate,
     I charge thee be thou temperate;
     Unto thine elders at the board
     Do thou sweet reverence accord;
     And, though to dignity inclined,
     Unto the serving-folk be kind;
     Be ever mindful of the poor,
     Nor turn them hungry from the door;
     And unto God, for health and food
     And all that in thy life is good,
     Give thou thy heart in gratitude.


246

Words of praise are almost as necessary to warm a child into a genial
life as acts of kindness and affection. Judicious praise is to children
what the sun is to flowers.

LINES ON MY NEW CHILD-SWEETHEART.

     I hold it a religious duty
     To love and worship children's beauty;
     They've least the taint of earthly clod,
     They're freshest from the hand of God;
     With heavenly looks they make us sure
     The heaven that made them must be pure;
     We love them not in earthly fashion,
     But with a beatific passion.
     I chanced to, yesterday, behold
     A maiden child of beauty's mould;
     'Twas near, more sacred was the scene,
     The palace of our patriot Queen.
     The little charmer to my view
     Was sculpture brought to life anew.
     Her eyes had a poetic glow,
     Her pouting mouth was Cupid's bow:
     And through her frock I could descry
     Her neck and shoulders' symmetry.
     'Twas obvious from her walk and gait
     Her limbs were beautifully straight;
     I stopp'd th' enchantress and was told,
     Though tall, she was but four years' old.
     Her guide so grave an aspect wore
     I could not ask a question more;
     But follow'd her. The little one
     Threw backward ever and anon
     Her lovely neck, as if to say,
     "I know you love me, Mister Grey;"
     For by its instincts childhood's eye
     Is shrewd in physiognomy;
     They well distinguish fawning art
     From sterling fondness of the heart.
     And so she flirted, like a true
     Good woman, till we bade adieu.
     'Twas then I with regret grew wild,
     Oh, beauteous, interesting child!
     Why ask'd I not thy home and name?
     My courage fail'd me--more's the shame.
     But where abides this jewel rare?
     Oh, ye that own her, tell me where!
     For sad it makes my heart and sore
     To think I ne'er may meet her more.

INASMUCH.

One day a little girl looking out of the window saw a number of poor men
from a nearby jail, working in the hot sun of a July day. They looked
tired and hot, and she knew they must be thirsty. She remembered
Christ's words, "I was thirsty and ye gave Me drink, was in prison, and
ye came unto Me," and the thought came to her, "I can do both." With her
mother's permission she took a little bucket of cold water, with a
dipper, and gave to each man in turn, refilling the bucket several
times. As she went from one to another in her white frock, her sweet
smile gave even better cheer than the water. The thanks of the prisoners
were very hearty. One asked her, "Little lady, what made you do this?"

After a moment's pause, she replied, "That is what Christ said to do,
and--I was sorry myself." He lowered his head and said, "God bless you,
little Christ-child."

A man soon learns how little he knows, when a child begins to ask

The child's restless observation, instead of being ignored or checked,
should be diligently ministered to, and made as accurate as possible.

The Rev. John Brown was born in 1722, in the county of Perth in
Scotland. In a narrative of his experience, he remarks, "I reflect on it
as a great mercy, that I was born in a family which took care of my
Christian instruction, and in which I had the privilege of God's
worship, morning and evening. About the eighth year of my age, I
happened, in a crowd, to push into the church at Abernethy, on a
Sacrament Sabbath. Before I was excluded, I heard a minister speak much
in commendation of Christ; this, in a sweet and delightful manner,
captivated my young affections, and has since made me think that
children should never be kept out of church on such occasions."

To impose on a child to get by heart a long scroll of phrases without
any ideas, is a practice fitter for a jackdaw than for anything that
wears the shape of man.

THE CHILD AND THE "RISING DAY"

The following is a true narrative of an experience in life:

It was nearing three o'clock of last Easter afternoon, when a woman,
clad in deepest mourning, entered the gates of the beautiful "sleeping
place" on Walnut Hill. Her attitude, as she sank upon a carefully tended
mound, denoted deep dejection. She had not yet learned that the "tree of
death is fruited with the love of God," neither the joy of the
"afterward," but knew only the grope of a stricken soul.

In the distance, sat a child upon a grave, alone. Coming nearer, she
recognized him as one who had never known a mother, and whose father had
lately been taken, leaving him without kindred. The love between that
father and child had been passing sweet.

The bereaved lady knew this, and that he had been thrown homeless upon
the world. Yet, absorbed in her own grief, had given him little thought.
Drawing near, she observed closely the rare beauty of the boy, scarcely
five years of age, genius and nobility stamped on his brow, and
exquisite tenderness on the mobile lips.

He looked up eagerly, asking fearlessly, "Is your name Mary? Are you the
woman who talked with the angel when the stone was rolled away."

"Oh, no, dear," she replied. "Whom are you looking for?"

"For Jesus!" said the boy reverently.

"But he is not here. He is risen."

"Yes, I know, that's it, but I've been waiting here all day for Him to
come and raise my papa up. He's late, and I thought maybe He sent you to
tell me to wait a little, just as He sent Mary to tell His disciples,
you know," said the boy, wistfully.

"Yes, dear, but"--hesitating to shatter the boy's beautiful faith.

"I am tired" (pathetically), "but it is never too late for Jesus," he
added bravely, while a tear rolled down the velvet cheek. "He is sure to
come, 'cause it is the Rising Day" (exultingly). "Don't you 'member?"

The woman stooped to kiss the child, and began to sob violently,
dropping on the grave beside him.

"What makes you cry, lady? Is your papa here to be raised up?"

"No, no, darling, but my sweet daughter is."

"Don't cry, then," stroking the lady's hand. "Jesus never goes by Rising
Day. He'll surely come and give you your little girl and me my papa!
He'll come to-night. I saw the two men who came from [256:A]Emmaus go by
early this morning, and they will be walking back soon in the evening,
and Jesus will meet them and turn and walk with them, and they will all
be talking gently about the dying and the rising, and the men will not
know Him, but I shall, and He will stop here when I call, and raise my
papa up."

"How will you know Him, dear boy?"

"By His smile and the Transfiguration picture that papa showed me in his
study. But I'll know Him bestest in here," putting his hand on his
breast, "by the love!" raising his lustrous eyes to hers.

"Will you know your papa? Are you sure?"

"My papa!" with wondering ecstatic voice. "My own papa! I shall know him
by the love, and you your little girl. They will not look the same,
'cause Jesus didn't, but they knew Him by their love!"

"Yes?"

"And we'll know them by our love!" lingering fondly on the repetition
with lustrous, far-seeing gaze.

The woman clasped the child to her breast with a passionate embrace,
while rising to meet a supreme hour. (The child must not--shall not be
disappointed and his beautiful faith shattered).

"Phillip!" she said, "listen. The angel sent me to tell you that Jesus
had gone into heaven, and to take you to your papa. Come!"

Without a moment's hesitation he took his messenger's (?) hand and
passed out of the gates, looking not backward by a glance. Expectation
held him silent, while the woman's face was illumined by a great light.
Entering the door of a pleasant house, she passed on through the hall
into the dining-room, saying to the maid: "Bring some food for this dear
child; he has fasted all day."

A pitcher of milk and a plate of bread and honey were set beside a plate
of cold, broiled fish.

"Now I know this is the house," the boy exclaimed exultingly, "for they
had the fish, the bread and the honey! It's all here, just the same, and
he'll come to-night!"

Turning swiftly to the hall, the woman almost flew along the corridor to
meet her husband's steps. Drawing him to one side, she told with rapture
of her encounter and the sweet expectancy below.

"Now, Harold, Heaven has sent us a child, who shall be the angel to roll
away the stone from our grave. His wonderful vision must not be
darkened, neither his faith destroyed. Rise, my husband, to the most
glorious hour of your life. 'I shall know him by the love,' he said. Let
us see that he does."

Returning for the child and extending her hand with a smile, he eagerly
asked, "Will you wash and comb me to meet my papa? It isn't too late
yet, is it?"

The voice was half a sob, but full of hope. The ineffable trust pierced
her heart while reassuring him with swift, tender tones.

"Come, Phillip, we will go to him," she cried tremblingly.

As she opened the door upon a winning, noble-faced man with tears on his
cheek, smiling with outstretched arms upon the boy, he hesitated a
moment, took one step forward and then leaped into the open arms, threw
his noble head back, and gazed with lustrous, questioning eyes.

"You don't look like my papa, quite."

"No?" (anxiously).

"'Cause you are changed. But I know you by the love, and you know me,
don't you?"

"By the love, dear boy," with shining eyes, but marble lips.

The child nestled down upon the breast, his chest heaving, while the man
stroked the soft curls, soothing him with every word known to love's
alphabet, till finally, crooning a cradle song, the exhausted child fell
asleep. He had found a father by the love. His faith was saved, and by
it, she who had groped blindly among the tombs had found her Easter.

The way to spoil a child is to give it all it wants and require nothing
in return. The way to make a child grow up sensible and unselfish is to
give it little, and require of it much. For it is not what others do for
us that benefits us, but what we do for ourselves and others.

Some one truly said, the best way for a man to train up a child in the
way it should go, is to travel that way sometimes himself.

CHILDREN.

I never hear parents exclaim impatiently, "Children, you must not make
so much noise," that I do not think how soon the time may come when,
beside the vacant chair, those parents would give all the world, could
they hear once more the ringing laughter which once so disturbed them.

A BAD EXAMPLE.

Whatever parent gives his children good instruction, and sets them at
the same time a bad example, may be considered as bringing them food in
one hand, and poison in the other.

Children have neither past nor future; and what scarcely ever happens to
us, they enjoy the present.

An honorable life is the best legacy a father can leave to his children.


273

Children should not be flattered, but they should be encouraged. They
should not be so praised as to make them vain and proud, but they should
be commended when they do well.

Children are excellent physiognomists, and soon discover their real
friends.

Choose rather to leave your children well instructed than rich. For the
hopes of the learned are better than the riches of the ignorant.

WOULD YOU HAVE ANSWERED SO?

You would not be in a Japanese house long without noticing their extreme
politeness, and that this politeness was especially shown by children
toward their parents. The one thing that Japanese children must learn is
perfect obedience; a child would as soon think of refusing to do a thing
altogether, when told, as to ask why he must do it.

A little * * * girl, the child of a missionary, was playing in the
street with some Japanese children.

"Mary," called her father from the house, "come in."

As she paid no attention, the others thought she had not heard, and
began to say to her: "Your august father is calling you," "Your
honorable parent is beckoning to you," and so on.

"I don't care," said Mary.

The children stopped playing and looked at her in astonishment. Her
father called her again. This time she answered crossly, "I don't want
to come in. What for?"

At this the children picked up their playthings and hurried home,
talking excitedly all the way. "Rude little foreigner!" "Bad little
girl!" they said, and it was a long time before Mary saw anything of her
friends again.

present time, which few of us do.

_Spurgeon said_: "With children we must mix gentleness with firmness;
they must not always have their own way, but they must not always be

have plenty of heartaches when they grow up. If you yield up your
authority once, you will hardly ever get it again."

294

_Their Little Needs_--It is often asserted that both men and women would
be selfish beings but for children. They call out, and refine, and
soften the best feelings of the parental heart. Their little needs are
so many, and their simple ignorance so affecting, and their very
caprices so winning, that love and attention flow out to them almost
instinctively.

That must be a hardened nature which can be unmoved by the soft touch,
the playful childishness, and the hundred little pranks of a baby.

You can not expect better manners from your children than you teach
them. They imitate instinctively.


296

Children should be taught early to sympathize with the deformed, the
crippled, and otherwise unfortunate beings: A little dwarfed girl in one
of our great cities committed suicide a few years ago because she was
so weary of being laughed at and ridiculed by her associates in the
streets and at school.

An old street pedlar was set upon by school children and so annoyed and
misused that he became insane.

MY CHILDREN STILL.

A young preacher recently called upon an eminent Divine, and in the
course of conversation asked him how many children he had. "Four, sir,"
was the reply. At the supper-table, the visitor perceived two beautiful
children seated by the side of the mother. Turning to his host, he said,
"I thought you had four children, sir: Where are the other two?" Lifting
his eyes, the holy man of God pointed upwards, while a sweet smile broke
over his countenance. "They are in Heaven," he repeated slowly and
calmly; "yet my children still: not dead, but gone before."


298

Dr. Samuel Johnson once said, "Above all, accustom your children
constantly to tell the truth; without varying in any circumstance." A
lady who heard him said, "Nay, this is too much, for a little variation
in narrative must happen a thousand times a day, if one is not
perpetually watching." "Well, madam," said the Doctor, "you ought to be
perpetually watching."

He knows not what love is, that has no children.

Children are travelers newly arrived in a strange country; we should
therefore make conscience not to mislead them.


301

IT'S ONLY ME.

A lady had two children--both girls. The elder was a fair child; the
younger a beauty, and the mother's pet. Her whole love centered in it.
The elder was neglected, while "Sweet" (the pet name of the younger)
received every attention that affection could bestow. One day, after a
severe illness, the mother was sitting in the parlor, when she heard a
childish footstep on the stairs, and her thoughts were instantly with
the favorite.

"Is that you, Sweet?" she enquired.

"No, mamma," was the sad, touching reply, "it isn't Sweet: it's only
me."

The mother's heart smote her; and from that hour "only me" was restored
to an equal place in her affections.


302

Children are usually what their mothers were, or are.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PERSON OF JESUS CHRIST.

The following description is alleged to be derived from an ancient
manuscript sent by Publius Lentellus, President of Judea, to the Senate
of Rome:

     "There lives at this time in Judea, a man of singular
     character, whose name is Jesus Christ. The barbarians esteem
     Him as their prophet; but His followers adore Him as the
     immediate offspring of the immortal God. He is endowed with
     such unparalleled virtue as to call back the dead from their
     graves and to heal every kind of disease with a word or a
     touch. His person is tall and elegantly shaped; His aspect,
     amiable and reverend; His hair flows in those beauteous shades
     which no united colors can match, falling in graceful curls
     below His ears, agreeably couching on His shoulders, and
     parting on the crown of His head; His dress, that of the sect
     of Nazarites; His forehead is smooth and large; His cheeks
     without blemish, and of roseate hue; His nose and mouth are
     formed with exquisite symmetry; His beard is thick and
     suitable to the hair of His head, reaching a little below His
     chin, and parting in the middle below; His eyes are clear,
     bright, and serene.

     "He rebukes with mildness, and invokes with the most tender
     and persuasive language--His whole address, whether in word or
     deed, being elegantly grave, and strictly characteristic of so
     exalted a being. No man has seen Him laugh, but the whole
     world beholds Him weep frequently, and so persuasive are His
     tears that the whole multitude can not withhold their tears
     from joining in sympathy with Him. He is moderate, temperate,
     and wise; in short, whatever the phenomenon may turn out in
     the end, He seems at present to be a man of excellent beauty
     and Divine perfection, every way surpassing man."


307

LAST SUPPER.

To turn one's back on the Memorial Supper is to disregard the most
tender, and loving, and melting of all our Saviour's commandments. It is
not needful to know just how obedience will help us. It is enough to
know that it was His dying command that we keep it till He come.

IS NOT THIS THE CARPENTER?

_Mark, vi, 3._

     Yes, yes, a Carpenter, same trade as mine.
     It warms my heart as I read that line.
     I can stand the hard work, I can stand the poor pay,
     For I'll see that Carpenter at no distant day.

He that thinks he hath no need of Christ hath too high thoughts of
himself. He that thinks Christ can not help him hath too low thoughts of

     There is no fire without heat,

     No water without moisture,
     And there is no Christian
     Who is not Christlike.

As Henry Drummond, on board a government packet, was steaming away from
that group of islands known as the New Hebrides, after having visited
the missions there, he was asked by a fellow-passenger who had been
visiting the islands for a very different purpose, what good the
missionary had been to those people. "My dear young man," said Drummond,
"only for the missionary, you and I, instead of being in this cabin,
would probably by this time have been inside some of those savages, as
you call them, who waved us such an affectionate farewell from their
shores." Yes, Christianity is now recognized the world over, as foremost
among the moral forces that are civilizing the dark corners of the
earth. Even Matthew Arnold was forced to admit that there is no
civilization without it. "Show me," he said, "ten square miles outside
of Christianity where the life of man or woman is safe, and I'll throw
over Christianity at once."

PLENTY OF ROOM.

A visiting bishop, in Washington, was arguing with a senator on the
desirability of attending church. At last he put the question squarely:
"What is your personal reason for not attending?"

The senator smiled in a no-offense-intended way, as he replied: "The
fact is, one finds so many hypocrites there."

Returning the smile, the bishop said:

"Don't let that keep you away, senator; there's always room for one
more."

HOW THE CHURCH MUST GROW.

It has seemed sometimes in recent years as if the deaths were more than
the births. This has brought home to the Church the absolute need of the
revival of religion if Christianity is not to perish from the world
which it has re-made. The Church is not an establishment in the world,
but an encampment. She has no natural increase. She lives only by
capture, by winning over from the world the citizens that make her
number. One must arm another with the Christian panoply, if the Church
is to continue.

HOW TO WARM UP THE CHURCH.

I was once preaching in Scotland, and when I got to the church it was so
cold that I could see my breath three feet away, said Rev. D. L. Moody.
I said to the "beadle," as they call him:

"Aren't you going to have any heat in this building?"

He said they had no stoves or any other provision for heat.

"Well, how do you expect people to get warm?"

"Oh!" he said, "we expect the pulpit to warm us up."

NOTE: _In Dr. Guthrie's Autobiography_, vol. I, page 125--Describing the
first church he became pastor of, in Arbirlot, in 1830, he says: "As to
stoves, they were never thought of--the pulpit had to keep the people
warm."


322

LATE CHURCH-GOERS.

A minister, observing that some of his people made a practice of coming
in very late, and after a considerable part of the sermon was over,
determined that they should feel the force of public reproof. One day,
therefore, as they entered the place of worship at their usual late
hour, the minister, addressing his congregation, said: "But, my hearers,
it is time for us now to conclude, for here are our friends just come to
fetch us home."

We may easily conjecture what the parties felt at this curious but
pointed address.

323

BOTH KEPT AWAKE IN CHURCH.

A country minister in Scotland, who was much annoyed by two members of
his congregation, Macpherson and Macintosh, sleeping during the sermon,
hit upon a way to put an end to this state of matters. Calling on
Macintosh, he said: "By the way, Mr. Macintosh, have you ever noticed
Mr. Macpherson sleeping during the sermon?" "Many a time," replied
Macintosh, virtuously. "Well, next Sunday you might sit beside
Macpherson and try and keep him awake." "I'll do that sir," said
Macintosh. Then the minister went to Macpherson and went through the
same programme concerning Macintosh.

Next Sunday it was highly amusing to those in the secret to see
Macintosh and Macpherson sitting next to each other, both perfectly wide
awake.

When once thy foot enters the church, beware, God is more there than
thou; for thou art there only by His permission. Then beware and make
thyself all reverence and fear.

There are two classes of people in the church; the one is made up of
those who do the hard work of the church, and the other of those who sit
at home and--criticise.

A great merchant was asked by what means he contrived to realize so
large a fortune as he possessed. His reply was: "Friend, by one article
alone, in which thou may'st deal too if thou pleasest--civility."

AN IDEAL.

     Before me on the mantel-block,
     There ticks a busy little clock--
         The measurer of time.
     It never stops or tries to shirk;
     Unceasingly it plies its work
         With zeal almost sublime.

     Oh could I work as steadily,
     Oh could I just as faithful be,
         As this minute machine--
     My life would be filled with success,
                             with industry,
                             with usefulness,

In his last annual report, President Eliot states that the average age
of students entering Harvard is eighteen years of age and ten months. He
then intimates that if students could be induced to enter college

COMPENSATION.

      Mothers of many, with envious eyes,
          Gaze as I drive through the evening cool,
      Swift as I pass them, we mingle our sighs,
          For my arms are empty--and theirs over-full.

     "See her," they say, "with her laces and pearls!
          All for the rich! 'Tis the world's common rule.
      We have but rags for our boys and our girls;
          Empty our pockets--her coffers are full."

      Mothers! To yours, tender voices reply,
          Little ones' hands at your skirts softly pull;
      Widowed and lonely and childless am I,
          Empty my heart--though my coffers are full.

RURAL LIFE.

The fact that the following verses are heard to-day proves their
"convenience," to say the least, for they were written by William
Livingston in 1747:----

     Mine be the pleasure of a rural life,
     From noise remote, and ignorant of strife,
     Far from the painted belle and white-gloved beau,
     The lawless masquerade, and midnight show,
     From lapdogs, courtiers, garters, stars,
     Fops, fiddlers, tyrants, emperors, and czars!

415

THE COUNTRY.

     A breath of unadulterated air,
     The glimpse of a green pasture, how they cheer
     The citizen, and brace his languid frame.
     Even in the stifling bosom of the town;
     A garden, in which nothing thrives, has charms
     That soothe the rich possessor.
     And are these not all proofs that man immured
     In cities, still retains his inborn inextinguishable
     Thirst of rural scenes, compensating his loss
     By supplemental shifts the best he may?


416

LOVE OF COUNTRY.

     Breathes there the man, with soul so dead,
     Who never to himself hath said,
     "This is my own--my Native Land!"
     Whose heart hath ne'er within him burned
     As home his footsteps he hath turned
     From wandering on a foreign strand?
     If such there breathe, go--mark him well;
     For him no minstrel raptures swell;
     High though his titles, proud his name,
     Boundless his wealth as wish can claim--
     Despite those titles, power and pelf,
     The wretch, concentred all in self,
     Living, shall forfeit fair renown,
     And, doubly dying, shall go down
     To the vile dust from whence he sprung,
     Unwept, unhonored, and unsung.

_Covetousness._--A young man once picked up a sovereign lying in the
road. Ever afterward, in walking along, he kept his eye fixed steadily
upon the ground in hopes to find another. And in the course of a long
life he did pick up, at different times, a goodly number of coins, gold
and silver. But all these years, while he was looking for them, he saw
not that the heavens were bright above him, and nature beautiful around.
He never once allowed his eye to look up from the mud and filth in which
he sought his treasure; and when he died--a rich old man--he only knew
this fair earth as a dirty road to pick up money as you walk along. Thus
you see the desire of having is the sin of covetousness.

Credit, like a looking-glass, broken once, is gone, alas!

He who doesn't take care of his credit will soon have none to take care
of.

There are two directly opposite reasons why some men cannot get
credit--one is because he is not known--the other because he is.

THE CRITIC.

     The critic stood with scornful eye
       Before a picture on the wall:
     "You call this art? Now see that fly,
       It is not natural at all.

     It has too many legs, its head
       Is far too large--who ever saw
     A fly like that, so limp and dead,
       And wings that look as if they--pshaw!"

     And with a gesture of disgust
       He waved his hand, when lo! the fly
     Flew from the picture. "Ah! some dust,"
       The critic said, "was in my eye."

any other business, and it is a very fascinating business, too, for
people of--small calibre.

     Save censure; critics all are ready-made.

BEREFT OF AN ONLY DAUGHTER.

     This day my loved one leaves me, and my heart
     Is heavy with its grief: the streams of sorrow,
     Choked at the source, repress my faltering voice.
     I have no words to speak; mine eyes are dimmed
     By the dark shadows of the thoughts that rise
     Within my soul. If such the force of grief
     In an old hermit parted from his nursling,
     What anguish must the stricken parent feel
     Bereft forever of an only daughter!

     Weep not my daughter, check the gathering tear
     That lurks beneath thine eyelid, ere it flow
     And weaken thy resolve; be firm and true--
     True to thyself and me, the path of life
     Will lead o'er hill and plain, o'er rough and smooth,
     And all must feel the steepness of the way,
     Tho' rugged be thy course, press boldly on.

     Honor thy betters; even be respectful
     To those above thee. Should thy wedded lord
     Treat thee with harshness, thou must never be
     Harsh in return, but patient and submissive.
     Be to thy menials courteous, and to all
     Placed under thee considerate and kind:
     Be never self-indulgent, but avoid
     Excess in pleasure; and, when fortune smiles
     Be not puffed up. Thus to thy husband's house
     Wilt thou a blessing prove, and not a curse.


439

     See here it is dawning
         Another bright day:
     Think wilt thou let it
       Slip uselessly away?

THE REPROOF OF A FOOL.

There was a certain nobleman who kept a fool, to whom he one day gave a
staff, with a charge to keep it till he should meet with one who was a
greater fool than himself. Not many years after, the nobleman fell sick,
even unto death. The fool came to see him: his lord said to him--"I must
shortly leave you." "And whither are you going?" said the fool. "Into
another world," replied his lordship. "And when will you come again?
Within a month?" "No." "Within a year?" "No." "When then?" "Never."
"Never!" said the fool, "and what provision hast thou made for thy
entertainment there, whither thou goest?" "None at all." "No!" said the
fool, "none at all! Here then, take my staff; for with all my folly, I
am not guilty of any such folly as this."

DECISION.

     Lose this day loitering,--'t will be the same story
     To-morrow, and the next more dilatory;
     The indecision brings its own delays,
     And days are lost lamenting over days.
     Are you in earnest? Seize this very minute,
     What you can do, or dream you can, begin it.
     Boldness has genius, power and magic in it.
     Only engage, and then the mind grows heated,--
     Begin,
         And then the work
                        Will be completed.

NOBLE DEEDS.

     He built a house, time laid it in the dust;
         He wrote a book, its title now forgot;
         He ruled a city, but his name is not
     On any tablet graven, or where rust
     Can gather from disuse, or marble bust.
         He took a child from out a wretched cot,
         Who on the state dishonor might have brought,
     And reared him to the Christian's hope and trust.
     The boy to manhood grown, became a light
     To many souls, preached for human need
     The wondrous love of the Omnipotent.
         The work has multiplied like stars at night
         When darkness deepens; every noble deed
         Lasts longer, than a granite monument.

RISE ABOVE YOUR DIFFICULTIES.

Not till after the death of a member of Parliament, a prominent county
magistrate, the owner of large estates, and an active, public-spirited
man in all local and national matters, was it known by those who had not
seen him, that it was but the misshapen block of a man that had lived
this active, manly life.

He was born with neither legs nor arms. After his death his story was
told: how he resolved, when but a boy, to act and live as did other
boys, without regard to his horrible misfortune; how he persisted in
studying every book, in learning every game, in joining in every
amusement possible to him, with his companions. How, to the last year of
his life, he held himself to be as responsible as other men, and bravely
paid every tithe of duty to God and to his fellows.

Even in lesser matters in life he pressed to the front. He was the most
genial, witty guest at social dinner tables. Strapped to his horse, he
hunted foxes in Yorkshire, or tigers in India, and with his brothers
made long journeys in other parts of the world. Everywhere his
cheerfulness and gaiety gave new life to duller souls.

Is there no lesson for us all in the life of this gallant gentleman?

THE FAITHFUL DOG.

     When wise Ulysses, from his native coast
     Long kept by wars, and long by tempests tost,
     Arrived at last, poor, old, disguised, alone,
     To all his friends, and ev'n his queen, unknown:
     Chang'd as he was with age, and toils, and cares,
     Furrow'd his rev'rend face, and white his hairs,
     In his own palace forc'd to ask his bread,
     Scorn'd by those slaves his former bounty fed,
     Forgot of all his own domestic crew;
     The faithful _dog_ alone his master knew!
     Unfed, unhous'd, neglected, on the clay
     Like an old servant, now cashier'd he lay;
     And, tho' e'en then expiring on the plain
     Touch'd with resentment of ungrateful man,
     And longing to behold his ancient lord again.
     Him, when he saw--he rose, and crawl'd to meet,
     'Twas all he could, and fawn'd, and kiss'd his feet,
     Seized with dumb joy: then, falling by his side,
     Own'd his returning lord, look'd up, and died.

THE ORPHAN BOY'S DREAM.

     The room is old--the night is cold,--
       But night is dearer far than day;
     For then, in dreams, to him it seems
       That she's returned who's gone away!
     His tears are pass'd--he clasps her fast,--
       Again she holds him on her knee;
     And, in his sleep, he murmurs deep,
       "Oh! mother, go no more from me!"

     We sacrifice to dress, till household joys

Those who think that in order to dress well, it is necessary to dress

_Numbers vi, 3._--"He shall separate himself from wine and strong
drink."

A heathen king, who had been for years confirmed in the sin of
drunkenness by the evil practices of white men on the Sandwich Islands,
had been led to forsake the dreadful habit. He said lately to a
missionary, "suppose you put four thousand dollars in one hand, and a
glass of rum in the other; you say, you drink this rum, I give you four
thousand dollars, I no drink it; you say you kill me, I no drink it."

THE RIGHT ANSWER.

In an address to a temperance society, Admiral Capps told a story which
is printed in the New York _Tribune_.--A man who had ruined his health
with alcohol sat looking sadly at his wife, to whom he had made many
promises of reform.

"Jenny," he said, "you are a clever woman, a courageous, good woman. You
should have married a better man than I am."

She looked at him, thin-limbed and stoop-shouldered, prematurely old,
and answered, quietly, "I did, James."

_Genesis ix, 21_--"Noah drank of the wine, and was drunken."

A person in Maryland, who was addicted to drunkenness, hearing a
considerable uproar in his kitchen one night, felt the curiosity to step
without noise to the door, to know what was the matter; when he found
his servants indulging in the most unbounded roars of laughter at a
couple of negro boys, who were mimicking himself in his drunken
fits!--as how he reeled and staggered--how he looked and nodded--and
hiccupped and tumbled. The pictures which these children of nature drew
of him, and which had filled the rest with such inexhaustible merriment,
struck him with so salutary a disgust, that from that night he became a
perfectly sober man, to the great joy of his wife and children.

Pray tell me whence you derive the origin of the word dun? The true
origin of this expression owes its birth to one Joe Dunn, a famous
bailiff of the town of Lincoln, England, so extremely active, and so
dexterous at the management of his rough business, that it became a
proverb, when a man refused to pay his debts, "Why don't you Dun him?"
that is, why don't you send Dun to arrest him? Hence it grew a custom,
and is now as old as since the days of Henry VII.

EXTERNAL SIGNS OF EMOTIONS AND PASSIONS.

One would not imagine who has not given particular attention, that the
body should be susceptible to such variety of attitudes and emotions, as
readily to accompany every different emotion with a corresponding
expression. Humility for example, is expressed naturally by hanging the
head; arrogance, by its elevation; and languor or despondence, by
reclining it to one side. The expressions of the hands are manifold by
different attitudes and motions; they express desire, hope, fear; they
assist us in promising, in inviting, in keeping one at a distance; they
are made instruments of threatening, of supplication, of praise, and of
horror; they are employed in approving, in refusing, in questioning; in
showing our joy, our sorrow, our doubts, our regret, and our admiration.

_Boswell said of Dr. Johnson_--"Though a stern true-born Englishman, and

Englishmen towards strangers. 'Sir,' said he, (Johnson) 'two men of any
other nation who are shown into a room together, at a house where they
are both visitors, will immediately find some conversation. But two
Englishmen will probably go each to a different window, and remain in
obstinate silence. Sir, we as yet do not enough understand the common

THE MOUNTAIN FLOWER.

In Ross-shire, Scotland, there is an immense mountain gorge. The rocks
have been rent in twain, and set apart twenty feet, forming two
perpendicular walls two hundred feet in height. On either side of these
natural walls, in crevices where earth has collected, grow wild flowers
of rare quality and beauty. A company of tourists visiting that part of
the country were desirous to possess themselves of specimens of these
beautiful mountain flowers; but how to obtain them they knew not. At
length they thought they might be gathered by suspending a person over
the cliff by a rope. They offered a Highland boy, who was near by, a
handsome sum of money to undertake the difficult and dangerous task. The
boy looked down into the awful abyss that yawned below, and shrunk from
the undertaking; but the money was tempting. Could he confide in the
strangers? Could he venture his life in their hands? He felt that he
could not; but he thought of his father, and, looking once more at the
cliff, and then at the proffered reward, his eyes brightened, and he
exclaimed: "I'll go if my father holds the rope." Beautiful illustration
of the nature of faith.

All that a man gets by being untruthful is, that he is not believed when
he speaks the truth.

you will suffer from the thorns and briers in the wild woods.

FAMILY REUNION.

                       We are all here--
     Father, mother, sister, brother,
     All who hold each other dear.
     Each chair is filled, we're all at home;
     To-night let no stranger come.
     It is not often thus around
     Our old, familiar hearth we're found
     Blessed, then, the meeting and the spot:
     For once be every care forgot;
     Let gentle peace assert her power,
     And kind affection rule the hour:
                       We're all, all here.

FAREWELL.

     If thou dost bid thy friend farewell,
     But for one night though that farewell may be,
     Press thou his hand in thine.
     How canst thou tell how far from thee
     Fate or caprice may lead his steps ere that to-morrow comes?
     Men have been known lightly to turn the corner of a street,
     And days have grown to months,
     And months to lagging years, ere they
     Have looked in loving eyes again . . . . . .
     Yea, find thou always time to say some earnest word
     Between the idle talk, lest with thee henceforth,
     Night and day, regret should walk.

MAN AND THE FARM.

It is a common complaint that the farm and farm life are not appreciated
by our people. We long for the more elegant pursuits, or the ways and
fashions, of the town. But the farmer has the most sane and natural
occupation, and ought to find it sweeter, if less highly seasoned, than
any other. He alone, strictly speaking, has a home. How many ties, how
many resources, he has!--his friendship with his cattle, his team, his
dog, his trees; the satisfaction in his growing crops, in his improved
fields; his intimacy with nature, with bird and beast, and with the
quickening elemental forces; his co-operations with the cloud, the sun,
the seasons, heat, wind, rain, frost. It humbles him, teaches him
patience and reverence. Cling to the farm, make much of it, put yourself
into it, bestow your heart and brain upon it.

                                         --_John Burroughs._

A HINT TO A FARMER.

     Shun thou seats in the shade, nor sleep till the dawn! in the
           season
     When it is harvest-time, and your skin is parched in the sunshine.

MY FATHER.

How beautiful is the following picture by Caroline Anne Bowles, only
child of Captain Charles Bowles, of Blackland, England. Born 1787:

     My father loved the patient angler's art,
     And many a summer's day, from early morn
     To latest evening, by some streamlet's side,
     We two have tarried; strange companionship!
     A sad and silent man; a joyous child!
     Yet those were days as I recall them now
     Supremely happy. Silent though he was,
     My father's eyes were often on his child
     Tenderly eloquent--and his few words
     Were kind and gentle. Never angry tone
     Repulsed me if I broke upon his thoughts
     With childish question. But I learned at last,
     Learned intuitively to hold my peace.
     When the dark hour was on him, and deep sighs
     Spoke the perturbed spirit--only then
     I crept a little closer to his side,
     And stole my hand in his, or on his arm
     Laid my cheek softly: till the simple wile
     Won on his sad abstraction, and he turned
     With a faint smile, and sighed and shook his head,
     Stooping toward me; so I reached at last
     Mine arm about his neck and clasped it close,
     Printing his pale brow with a silent kiss.

                              --_From Littell's Living Age._

_Love for a Father._--In the year 1773, a gentleman in England, whose
health was rapidly declining, was advised by his physicians to go to Spa
for the recovery of his health. His daughters feared that those who had
only motives entirely mercenary would not pay him that attention which
he might expect from those who, from duty and affection united, would
feel the greatest pleasure in ministering to his ease and comfort; they,
therefore, resolved to accompany him. They proved that it was not a
spirit of dissipation and gaiety that led them to the springs, for they
were not to be seen in any of the gay and fashionable circles; they were
never out of their father's company, and never stirred from home, except
to attend him, either to take the air or drink the waters; in a word,
they lived a most recluse life in the midst of a town then the resort of
the most illustrious and fashionable personages of Europe. This
exemplary attention to their father procured these three amiable sisters
the admiration of all the visitors at Spa, and was the cause of their
elevation to that rank in life to which their merits gave them so just a
title. They were all married to noblemen: one to the Earl of Beverly,
another to the Duke of Hamilton, and a third to the Duke of
Northumberland. And it is justice to them to say that they reflected
honor on their rank, rather than derived any from it.

MY FATHER.

                              I have a Father!
     It needeth not that I should see His face,
     When each new day brings token of His grace.
     Who can deny the Power that brings to pass
     The yearly miracle of springing grass?
     Who can withhold allegiance, that sees
     The harvest glory of the fruited trees?


575

     Confessing a fault makes half amends.
     Denying one doubles it.


576

Not to repent of a fault, is to justify it.

     Whoever thinks a faultless one to see
     Thinks what ne'er was, nor is, nor e'er will be.

_Faults._--Every man has a bag hanging before him, in which he puts his
neighbors' faults, and another behind him in which he stows his own.

579

     Better find one of our own faults,
           Than ten
                 Of our neighbor's.

A GREAT MAN'S FAULTS.

Lord Bolingbroke was one evening at a large party. Political subjects
were talked of, and the conversation finally turned on the famous Duke
of Marlborough. Every one had something to say against him, many blaming
his avarice. Bolingbroke was silent. One of the company inquired, "How
is it that you say nothing? You knew him better than all of us, and
could tell us a good deal about him." Bolingbroke replied, "He was a
great man, and I have forgotten all his faults."


581

     Each should be sure of an untarnished name,
     Before he ventures others' faults to blame.

The greatest of faults, is to be conscious of none.

586

FAVORITISM.

     A little figure glided through the hall.
       "Is that you, Pet?" the words came tenderly.
     A sob--suppressed to let the answer fall,--
       "It isn't Pet, mama, it's only me."

     The quivering baby-lips! They had not meant
       To utter any word that could plant a sting,
     But to that mother-heart a strange pang went;
       She heard, and stood like a convicted thing.

     One instant, and a happy little face
       Thrilled 'neath unwonted kisses rained above;
     And from that moment "Only Me" had place
       And part with Pet in tender mother-love.


587

We like better to see those on whom we confer benefits, than those,
alas! from whom we receive them.

It is not the quantity of the meat but the cheerfulness of the guests,

FEASTING AND FASTING.

     Accustom early in your youth
     To lay embargo on your mouth;
     And let no rarities invite
     To pall and glut your appetite;
     But check it always, and give o'er
     With a desire of eating more;
     For where one dies by inanition,
     A thousand perish by repletion:
     To miss a meal sometimes is good,--
     It ventilates and cools the blood.

Every young man has a fine season in his life when he will accept no
office, and every young woman has the same in hers, when she will accept
no husband; by and by they both change, and often take one another into
the bargain.

       At ball or concert, rout or play;
     Whilst, far from fashion's idle noise,
       Her gilded domes, and trappings gay,

       'Twixt book and lute the hours divide
     And marvel how I e'er could stray

admire the qualities of others. I do not mean flattery, but a sincere
admiration." _Johnson_: "Nay, Sir, flattery pleases very generally. In

the second place, whether he thinks so or not, he certainly thinks those
whom he flatters of consequence enough to be flattered."

A FOREST IDYL.

     Stranger, if thou hast learned a truth which needs
     No school of long experience, that the world
     Is full of guilt and misery, and hast seen
     Enough of all its sorrows, crimes and cares
     To tire thee of it, enter this wild wood
     And view the haunts of Nature. The calm shade
     Shall bring a kindred calm, and the sweet breeze
     That makes the green leaves dance, shall waft a balm

     One of you all that ever from my presence

     I here, in meek repentance, of him crave
     A brother's hand, in token of forgiveness.

THE ALTERNATIVES.

A gentleman went to a friend, in great anger at a real injury he had
received, which he intended to resent. After relating the particulars,
he enquired if it would not be _manly_ to resent it? His friend replied,
"Yes; it would doubtless be _manly_ to resent it, but it would be
_godlike_ to forgive it."


619

FORGIVENESS.

                               How beautifully falls
     Forgiveness--'tis the attribute of God--
     From human lips that bless'd word, Forgive;
     Thrice happy he whose heart has been so schooled
     That he can give it utterance; it imparts
     Celestial grandeur to the human soul,
     And maketh man an angel.

We forgive just as long as we love.


621

FORGIVE.

     Hast thou a grudge within thy breast,
       Which time will not repair?
     Is hatred still a lurking guest
       To intercept thy prayer?
     "Forgive, and thou shalt be forgiven"
       Is the decree of heaven.

     "Till seven times! shall I forgive?"
       Was asked our gracious Lord,

SUPPOSE YOU TRY FORGIVENESS.

The story is told of a British soldier who had broken every rule of the
army and on whom every form of punishment had been inflicted without
avail. He sinned again. His commanding officer was in despair as to what
should be done. A fellow officer said, "Suppose you try forgiveness."
The guilty soldier was summoned. On being asked what he had to say in
palliation of his offense, he hung his head and replied: "Nothing,
except I'm very sorry." "Well," said the officer, "We have decided to
forgive you." The culprit looked dazed, burst into tears, saluted, and
went out to become one of the best soldiers in the army.

GOD IN THE HEART.

Collins, the freethinker, met a plain countryman going to church. He
asked him where he was going. "To church sir." "What to do there?" "To
worship God." "Pray, whether is your God a great or little God?" "He is
both, sir." "How can He be both?" "He is so great that the heaven of
heavens cannot contain Him, and so little that He can dwell in my
heart." Collins declared that this simple answer had an effect upon his
mind such as all the volumes which learned men had written against him
had not.

FREEDOM WEEPS.

     A time like this demands
     Strong minds, stout hearts, true faith and ready hands;
     Men whom the lust of office cannot kill,
     Men whom the spoils of office cannot buy,
     Men who possess opinion and a will,
     Men who have honor, men who will not lie,
     Men who can stand before a demagogue
     And scorn his treacherous flatteries without winking,
     Tall men, sun crowned, who live above the fog
     In public duty, and in private thinking;
     For while the rabble with their thumb worn creeds,
     Their large professions, and their little deeds
     Mingle in selfish strife, lo! Freedom weeps,
     Wrong rules the land and waiting Justice sleeps!

He who attacks an absent friend, or who does not defend him when spoken
ill of by another--that man is a dark character; beware of him.

Be my friend, and teach me to be thine!

TIMON'S SOLILOQUY.

     My shadow, wheresoe'er I wend,
     Is with me, like a flattering friend.
     But chiefly when the sun in June
     Is climbing to its highest noon,
     My fond attendant closes near,
     As I were growing still more dear;
     And then, to show its love complete,
     Falls even servile at my feet,
     Where, proud of place, it scarcely nods
     Before the temple of the Gods.
     But when the evening sun descends,
     It seems to seek for other friends,
     Making a dial of the town,
     To tell that Timon's day goes down;
     And when the stormy night comes on,
     I look, and lo! my shade is--gone.

     Ah, how good it feels;
     The hand of an old friend!


648

If you want enemies, excel others; if you want friends, let others excel
you.


649

A man may have a thousand intimate acquaintances and not a friend among
them all. If you have one friend, think yourself happy.


650

Go slowly to the entertainment of your friends, but quickly to their
misfortunes.


651

LEAVE A FRIEND.

Leave a friend! So base I am not. I followed him in his prosperity, when
the skies were clear and shining, and will not leave him when storms
begin to rise; as gold is tried by the furnace, and the baser metal is
shown, so the hollow-hearted friend is known by adversity.

Do not lose sight of old attachments for the sake of making new
friendships.


653

A man who is fond of disputing, will, in time, have few friends to
dispute with.


654

AN OLD RHYME.

     I once had money and a friend,
       By both I set great store;
     I lent my money to my friend,
       He was my friend no more.

     If I had my money and my friend,
       As I had once before,
     I'd keep my money to myself,
       And lose my friend no more.

655

     If you have a friend worth loving,
       Love him. Yes, and let him know
     That you love him, ere life's evening
       Tinge his brow with sunset glow;
     Why should good words ne'er be said
       Of a friend till he is dead?


656

It is more dishonorable to distrust a friend than to be deceived by him.

No life is so strong and complete, But it sometimes yearns for the smile
of a friend.

                                          --_Wallace Bruce._


658

He was never a friend who ceased to be so--for a slight cause.

A friend cannot be known in prosperity; and an enemy cannot be hidden in
adversity.


660

When a friend asks, there should be no tomorrow.


661

The best mirror is an old friend.


662

I am not of that feather to shake off my friend when he must need me. I
do know him, a gentleman that well deserves a help, which he shall have:
I'll pay the debt and free him.

A cut or slight from a foe or stranger, may be scarred over, but a stab
from a friend you love hardly ever heals.

664

He that telleth thee that thou art always wrong, may be deceived; but he
that saith that thou art always right, is surely not telling the truth.


665

No man can be happy without a friend, nor be sure of his friend till he
is unfortunate.


666

He that ceases to be a friend never was a good one.


667

A FRIEND THAT STICKETH CLOSER THAN A BROTHER.

     One there is above all others,
       Well deserves the name of Friend!
     His is love beyond a brother's,
       Costly, free, and knows no end:
     They who once His kindness prove,
       Find it everlasting love!

It is to chance we owe our relatives, to choice our friends.

Equals make the best friends.

False friends are like our shadows, keeping close to us while we walk in
the sunshine, but leaving us the instant we cross into the shade.

676

By my skill I have got many acquaintances, my manners very many friends.


677

Friends are lost by calling often, and calling seldom.


678

CHOOSING FRIENDS.

We ought always to make choice of persons of such worth and honor for
our friends, that, if they should even cease to be so, they will not
abuse our confidence, nor give us cause to fear them as enemies.

                                                --_Addison._

Let us make the best of our friends while we have them, for how long we
shall keep them is uncertain.


680

     Friends are like melons. Shall I tell you why?
     To find one good, you must a hundred try.

Friends are sometimes like titled husbands, easy to get, if you have
enough money.

     Make new friends, but keep the old;

My treasures are my friends.

Without friends, no one would choose to live, even if he had all other
good things.

Old friends and old ways ought not to be disdained.

The poor man's assets are his friends.

Purchase not friends by gifts; when thou ceasest to give such will cease
to love.

RECOGNITION IN HEAVEN.

Baxter said:--"I must confess, as the experience of my own soul, that
the expectation of loving my friends in heaven principally kindles my
love to them while on earth. If I thought I should never know, and
consequently never love them after this life, I should number them with
temporal things, and love them as such; but I now delightfully converse
with my pious friends, in a firm persuasion that I shall converse with
them forever; and I take comfort in those that are dead or absent,
believing that I shall shortly meet them in heaven, and love them with a
heavenly love."


690

A gift kept back where it was hoped, often separateth chief friends.


691

Strange to say,--I am the only one of my friends I can rely upon.

                                                --_Terence._


692

There is no living without friends.

693

True friends anticipate each other's wants.


694

Friends are sometimes like mushrooms, they spring up in out-of-the-way
places.


695

At the gate of abundance there are many brothers and friends; at the
gate of misfortune there is neither brother nor friend.


696

It is one of the severest tests of friendship to tell a man of his
faults. So to love a man that you cannot bear to see the stain of sin
upon him, and to go to him alone and speak painful truths in touching,
tender words,--that is friendship, and a friendship as rare as it is
precious.


697

Henceforth there shall be no other contention betwixt you and me, than
which shall outdo the other in point of friendship.


698

Cultivate your neighbor's friendship; he needs you and you need him.


699

     Friendship often ends in love;
     But love, in friendship
     --Never.

Renewed friendships require more care than those that have never been
broken.

_Need for making Acquaintance._--If a man does not make new
acquaintances as he advances through life, he will soon find himself
left alone. A man should keep his friendship _in constant repair_.

703

     Who friendship with a knave hath made,
     Is judg'd a partner in the trade.


704

     What need of years, long years, to prove
     The sense of friendship, or of love!


705

There is truly nothing purer and warmer than our first friendship, our
first love.

                                      --_Jean Paul Richter._


706

The permanency of most friendships depends upon the continuity of good
fortune.


707

Quickly made friendships, are often eagerly and quickly ended.

FRIENDSHIP--RARITY OF.

Rare is true love: true friendship is still rarer.

Real friendship is like a sheltering tree.

He is my friend that helps me, and not he that pities me.

     Friendship has a power
     To soothe affliction in her darkest hour.

     O summer friendship,
     Whose flattering leaves, that shadow'd us in
     Our prosperity, with the least gust drop off
     In th' autumn of adversity!

THE HIGHER FRIENDSHIP.

Love Him, and keep Him for thy Friend, who, when all go away, will not
forsake thee, nor suffer thee to perish at the last.

                                        --_Thomas A'Kempis._


714

True friendship is one of the greatest blessings upon earth; it makes
the cares and anxieties of life sit easy; provides us with a partner in
every affliction to alleviate the burthen, and is a sure resort against
every accident and difficulty that can happen.


715

True friendship is like sound health; the value of it is seldom known
until it is lost.

                                                 --_Colton._


716

Those who speak always and those who never speak, are equally unfit for
friendship.


717

He who never gives advice, and he who never takes it are alike unworthy
of friendship.


718

He who is worthy of friendship at all will remember in his prosperity
those who were his friends in his adversity.


719

Value the friendship of him who stands by you in a storm; swarms of
insects will surround you in the sunshine.

No matter how poor and mean a man is, his friendship is worth more than
his hate.

If you would have your name chime melodiously in the ears of future

A GENTLEMAN.

Show me the man who can quit the brilliant society of the young and
listen to the kindly voice of age, who can hold cheerful converse with
one whom years have deprived of charms. Show me the man of generous
impulses, who is always ready to help the poor and needy; who treats
unprotected maidenhood as he would the heiress surrounded by the
protection of rank, riches and family; who never forgets for an instant
the delicacy, the respect, that is due a woman in any condition or
class. Show me such a man and you show me a gentleman--nay, more, you
show me a true Christian.


738

It's not the gay coat makes the gentleman.


739

The man who is kind and obliging and is ready to do you a favor without
hope of reward, who speaks the truth--is a gentleman,

     In any garb,
           And wherever he may be found.


740

Propriety of manners and consideration for others are the two main
characteristics of a gentleman.


741

REAL AND ARTIFICIAL GENTLEMEN.

A friend of mine, not long ago, coming over from Ireland, heard a man
asking, in reference to another, who he was. "I don't know," was the
reply; "but he's quite a gentleman. He always wears a tall hat." Indeed,
there are those who seem to be incapable of valuing their fellow-men by
anything except their clothes. A story is told of a Persian prince,
which well illustrates such worldliness. Dressed as a poor man, this
prince went to a feast. He was pushed here and there, could not get to
the table, and had soon to withdraw. On going home, he dressed himself
in his best, placing jewelled slippers on his feet, and putting on a
cloth-of-gold cloak. Then he returned to the feast, where matters were
immediately altered. The guests made room, and the host, rushing up,
cried, "Welcome, my lord! What will your lordship please to eat?" The
prince's answer was very expressive. Stretching out his foot, so that
his slipper sparkled and glittered, he took his golden robe in his hand,
and said with bitter irony, "Welcome, my lord coat! welcome, most
excellent robe! What will your lordship please to eat? For," said he,
turning to his surprised host, "I ought to ask my coat what it will eat,
since the welcome was solely to it."


742

We never teach men to be gentlemen, but we teach them everything else;
and they never pique themselves so much on all the rest, as on knowing
how to be gentlemen. They pique themselves only on knowing the one thing
they have not learnt.


743

The true gentleman is he who does not plume himself on anything.

                                          --_Rochefoucauld._


744

Let him speak who received; let the giver hold his peace.


745

Give freely to him that deserveth well and asketh nothing; and that is a
way of giving to thyself.

                                                 --_Fuller._


746

Better a penny given with a smile than a pound given with a frown.


747

To give so as to bestow a favor and not create an obligation, is a
delicate art.


748

He gives twice who gives quickly, according to the proverb; but a gift
not only given quickly but unexpectedly, is the most welcome of all.


749

He who sedulously attends, pointedly asks, calmly speaks, coolly
answers, and ceases when he has no more to say, is in possession of some
of the best mental gifts of mankind.


750

THE BEST GIFTS.

     The best of gifts to mortal man is health;
       The next, the bloom of beauty's matchless flower;
     The third is blameless and unfraudful wealth;
       The fourth with friends to use youth's joyous hour.

THE DYING GIRL TO HER LOVER.

     Fare thee well, love, fare thee well,
       From the world I pass away,
     Where the brightest things that dwell
       All deceive and all decay;
     Cheerfully I fall asleep
       As by some mysterious spell,
     Yet I weep to see thee weep--
       Fare thee well, love, fare thee well!

     Tell of me, love, tell of me,
       Not amid the heartless throng,
     Not when passion bends the knee,
       Not where pleasure trills the song.
     But when some most cherish'd one
       By your side at 'eve shall be,
     Ere your twilight tales are done,
       Tell of me, love, tell of me!

     Leave me now, love, leave me now,
       Not with sorrow, not with sighs,
     Not with clouds, love, on thy brow,
       Not with tears, love, in thine eyes.
     We shall meet, we know not where,
       And be blest, we dream not how,
     With a kiss and with a prayer
       Leave me now, love, leave me now!

ADVICE TO A GIRL.

     Never love unless you can
     Bear with all the faults of man!
     Men sometimes will jealous be
     Though but little cause they see,
     And hang the head as discontent,
     And speak what straight they will repent.

     Men, when their affairs require,
     Must awhile themselves retire;
     Sometimes hunt, and sometimes hawk,
     And not ever sit and talk:----
     If these and such-like you can bear,
     Then like, and love, and never fear!

                                         --_Thomas Campion._

THE EDUCATION OF GIRLS.

The Princess of Wales has decided views on the education of children.
Her Royal Highness, it appears, strongly objects to "cramming" children
with useless learning, which she declares is a mere waste of time.

The Princess considers it harmful to force a child in studies which are
distasteful to it, and that the child should be allowed to abandon that
study, and take up one it likes better.

Similarly, she disapproves of advanced arithmetic for girls. She
considers that all that most girls need ever know about arithmetic, is
addition and subtraction, "enough to know how to do their housekeeping
and pay their debts," she says.

THE HOUR GLASS

Is an emblem of human life. Behold! how swiftly the sands run, and how
rapidly our lives are drawing to a close! We cannot, without
astonishment, behold the little particles which are contained in this
machine; how they pass away almost imperceptibly! And yet, to our
surprise, in the short space of an hour, they are all exhausted. Thus
wastes man! To-day he puts forth the tender leaves of hope; to-morrow,
blossoms, and bears his blushing honors thick upon him; the next day
comes a frost, which nips the shoot; and when he thinks his greatness is
still aspiring, he falls, like autumn leaves, to enrich our mother
earth.

_The Greatness of God._--Said Dr. Guthrie, "If philosophy is to be
believed, our world is but an outlying corner of creation; bearing,
perhaps, as small a proportion to the great universe, as a single grain
bears to all the sands of the seashore, or one small quivering leaf to
the foliage of a boundless forest." Yet even within this earth's narrow
limits, how vast the work of Providence! How soon is the mind lost in
contemplating it! How great that Being whose hand paints every flower,
and shapes every leaf; who forms every bud on every tree; who feeds each
crawling worm with a parent's care, and watches like a mother over the
insect that sleeps away the night in the bosom of a flower; who throws
open the golden gates of day, and draws around a sleeping world the
dusky curtains of the night; who measures out the drops of every shower,
the whirling snowflakes, and the sands of man's eventful life; who
determines alike the fall of a sparrow and the fate of a kingdom; and so
overrules the tide of human fortunes, that whatever befall him, come joy
or sorrow, the believer says--"It is the Lord; let Him do what seemeth
Him good."

But as it is written, "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have

THE FATHER'S LOVE.

     Rest and be still:
     Nought happens thee but of His blessed will.
     There's not a wind that blows,
     There's not a lily grows
     Without His bidding--and His child shall He
     Forget and leave uncomforted? Nay, see
     How not a small brown sparrow (sorry thing!)
     Without His hand can droop or raise a wing!
     And thou art better far unto thy God!
     Lo! if He calls thee to a way untrod
     Where stones and rugged places tear thy feet,
     And bitter herbs alone are for thy meat,
     Or if He set thee high, and with a song
     Fill thy rejoicing mouth, and make thee strong;
     Yet know thou this: He loves thee just as dear
     When dimpling laughter lights thy face, or tear
     With bitter tear goes chasing down thy cheek,
     And thy poor heart may break but cannot speak!

     Rest and be still.
     God hath not good and ill.
     All that He sends is good, altho' our eye
     For weeping scarce His rainbow can descry.
     He is our Father, and His name is Love.
     E'en when thy grief is greatest--look above!
     Look up! look up! and thou shalt surely see
     A Father's loving face down-bent to thee!

THE LOVE OF GOD.

The following beautiful lines were composed in 1779, by a distinguished
scholar--at the time partially insane.

     Could we with ink the ocean fill,
       Were the whole earth of parchment made,
     Were every single stick a quill,
       Were every man a scribe by trade;
     To write the love of God alone,
       Would drain the ocean dry;
     Nor would the scroll contain the whole
       Though stretched from earth to sky.

Whoever devotes himself to the veneration of God, whatever road he may
choose, will come to God, and that the means to this, is, to avoid

THE GOLDEN RULE.

                                 If I should see
     A brother languishing in sore distress,
     And I should turn and leave him comfortless
                             When I might be
     A messenger of hope and happiness--
     How could I ask to have what I denied
     In my own hour of bitterness supplied?

                             If I might share
     A brother's load along the dusty way,
     And I should turn and walk alone that day--
                           How could I dare,
     When, in the evening watch, I knelt to pray
     To ask for help to bear my pain and loss,
     If I had heeded not my brother's cross?

                                 And so I know
     That day is lost wherein I fail to lend
     A helping hand to some wayfaring friend;
                                 But if it show
     A burden lightened by the cheer I sent,
     Then do I hold the golden hours well spent,
     And lay me down to sleep in sweet content.

GOLF AND MATRIMONY.

"As an illustration of the enthusiasm with which golf is pursued by its
votaries," says _Harper's Weekly_, "the following anecdote is told of a
well known Scotch author, and a young friend of his. The two had spent
the whole day on the links, and had had some close and exciting matches;
as they left for home the elder man remarked:

"'Do you think ye could play again to-morrow, laddie?'

"'Well,' answered the youth, 'I was going to be married to-morrow, but I
can put it off.'"

TOO LATE.

     And as each day, that ne'er returns,
       But joins the past,
     Comes and goes by, the rich man toils
       Hard at his task,--
     No time for thought or anything
       But just his wealth.
     Can he be dreaming life's for aye?
       Now fails his health,
     And death comes in and beckons him away.

     Good that was in his hands to do,
       He left undone,
     Forgetting, in his race for wealth,
       Life's setting sun!
     His thoughts all lay in how to make
       One dollar seven:
     And then, too late, he found, for gold
       There's no demand in heaven.

GOOD-BY.

     "Farewell! farewell!" is often heard
       From the lips of those who part:
     'Tis a whispered tone,--'tis a gentle word,
       But it springs not from the heart.
     It may serve for the lover's closing lay,
       To be sung 'neath a summer sky;
     But give to me the lips that say
       The honest words, "Good-by!"

     "Adieu! adieu!" may greet the ear,
       In the guise of courtly speech:
     But when we leave the kind and dear,
       'Tis not what the soul would teach.
     Whene'er we grasp the hands of those
       We would have forever nigh,
     The flame of friendship bursts and glows
       In the warm, frank words, "Good-by."

     The mother, sending forth her child

     Breathes through her tears, her doubts, and fears
       For the loved one's future life.
     No cold "adieu," no "farewell," lives
       Within her choking sigh,
     But the deepest sob of anguish gives,
       "God bless, thee, boy! 'Good-by!'"

At a small town in ----shire lives a decent honest woman, who has for
more than forty years gained her livelihood by washing in gentlemen's
families. She gives the highest satisfaction to all her employers, and
has, in several instances, been the whole of that time in the employ of
the same families. Indeed, those whom she has once served never wish to
part with her. She has one distinguishing excellency, it is this:
through all this course of years,--forty--she has never been known, by
either mistress or servant, to repeat in one house what was said or done
in another.

The king of one of the Friendly Islands became a Christian, and once
went on board of a British vessel, where he was invited to dine with the
officers. Observing he did not taste his food, the Captain inquired the
cause; when the simple native replied, that he was waiting for the
blessing to be asked. All felt rebuked, and the king was desired to say
grace, which he did with becoming solemnity.

AGAINST EXCESSIVE GRIEF.

(From a letter addressed to the Countess of Essex on the loss of her
only daughter.)

"I know no duty in religion more generally agreed on, nor more justly
required by God Almighty, than a perfect submission to His will in all
things; nor do I think any disposition of mind can either please Him
more, or become us better, than that of being satisfied with all He
gives, and contented with all He takes away. None, I am sure, can be of
more honor to God, nor of more ease to ourselves. For, if we consider
Him as our Maker, we cannot contend with Him; if as our Father, we ought
not to distrust Him: so that we may be confident whatever He does is
intended for good; and whatever happens that we interpret otherwise, yet
we can get nothing by repining, nor save anything by resisting.

Submission is the only way of reasoning between a creature and its
Maker; and contentment in His will is the greatest duty we can pretend
to, and the best remedy we can apply to all our misfortunes."

GOD'S SURE HELP IN SORROW.

           Leave all to God,
     Forsaken one, and stay thy tears;
         For the Highest knows thy pain,
     Sees thy sufferings and thy fears;
         Thou shalt not wait His help in vain;
           Leave all to God!

           Be still and trust!
     For His strokes are strokes of love,
         Thou must for thy profit bear;
     He thy filial fear would move,
         Trust thy Father's loving care,
           Be still and trust!

           Know God is near!
     Though thou think Him far away,
         Though His mercy long have slept,
     He will come and not delay,
         When His child enough hath wept,
           For God is near!

           Oh, teach Him not
     When and how to hear thy prayers;
       Never doth our God forget;
     He the cross who longest bears
         Finds his sorrows' bounds are set;
           Then teach Him not!

           If thou love Him,
     Walking truly in His ways,
         Then no trouble, cross or death
     E'er shall silence faith and praise;
         All things serve thee here beneath,
           If thou love God.

"Maybe the remark of a child I once overheard helped me to learn to
complain and grumble as little as possible," said Dr. Burt. "While I was
studying at Wilbraham Academy I spent a few days with this child's
father, a good man but a chronic growler. We were all sitting in the
parlor one night, when the question of food arose. The child, a little
girl, told cleverly what each member of the household liked best.
Finally it came to the father's turn to be described as to his favorite
dish.

'And what do I like, Lucy, my pet?' he said, laughingly.

'You,' said the little girl, slowly--'well, papa, dear, you like most
anything we haven't got.'"

Dr. Guthrie tells an anecdote in which he humorously introduces a
Brechin citizen, alive in his youthful days:--"An honest countryman came
one day to Mr. Linton (head master of the grammar school) with a
halflin[807:A], a long, empty chap, who had taken it into his head that
he would have some little learning. Said the father, 'Mr. Linton, ye
see, my laddie's fond o' lear'[807:B], and I'm thinking o' makin' a
scholar o' him.' 'But,' said Mr. Linton, looking at the youth, and not
seeing any sign that there was much in him, 'What are you to make of
him?' 'You see, Mr. Linton,' rejoined the father--and it showed how
sound the old Scotchman was--'if he gets grace, we'll make a minister o'
him!' 'Oh, but,' says Mr. Linton, 'if he does not get grace, what will
you make of him then?' 'Weel, in that case,' said the parent, 'if he
disna get grace, we'll just mak' a dominie o' him! '"

HOW TO CORRECT A BAD HABIT.

Penn was once advising a man to leave off his habit of drinking
intoxicating liquors.

"Can you tell me how to do it?" said the slave of his appetite.

"Yes," answered Penn. "It is just as easy as to open thy hand, friend."

"Convince me of that and I will promise, upon my honor, to do as you
tell me."

"Well, my friend," said the great Quaker, "when thou findest any vessel
of intoxicating liquor in thy hand, open the hand that grasps it before
it reaches thy mouth, and thou wilt never be drunk again."

The man was so pleased with the plain advice that he followed it.

You need not wrestle and strive with the old habit, only just be
persistent in forming the good one, and the bad one will take care of
itself.

INNOCENCE AND GUILT.

A painter, desiring to paint a picture of Innocence, found a beautiful
boy playing at the side of a stream, who became his model. He painted
him kneeling, with his hands clasped in prayer. The picture was prized
as a very beautiful one. Years passed away, and the artist became an old
man. He had often thought of painting a counterpart, the picture of
guilt, as a companion to the other; and at last he executed it. He went
to a neighboring prison, and there selected the most degraded and
repulsive man he could find. His body and eye were wasted; vice was
visible in his very face. But what was the artist's surprise when, on
questioning the man as to his history, he found that it was he who, as a
lovely boy, had kneeled for him as the model of Innocence! Evil habits
had gradually changed him, not only in heart and mind, but in face and
form.


817

     All habits gather by unseen degrees.
     As brooks make rivers, rivers run to seas.

Old habits are hard to break; new habits are hard to make.


819

Taste may change; our inclinations never change.

Habits are soon assumed--acquired--but when we strive to strip them
off,--if of long standing--'tis being flayed alive!

ELOQUENCE OF THE HANDS.

The hands are, by the very instincts of humanity, raised in prayer;
clasped in affection; wrung in despair; pressed on the forehead when the
soul is "perplexed in the extreme;" drawn inward, to invite; thrust
forth objectively, to repel; the fingers point to indicate, and are
snapped in disdain; the palm is laid upon the heart, in invocation of
subdued feeling, and on the brow of the compassioned in benediction. The
expressive capacity of the hands was never more strikingly displayed
than in the orisons (prayer) of the deaf and dumb. Their teacher stood
with closed eyes, and addressing the Deity by those signs made with the
fingers which constitute a language for the speechless. Around him were
grouped more than a hundred mutes, following with reverent glances every
motion. It was a visible, but not an audible, worship.


823

THE MOST BEAUTIFUL HAND.

A dispute arose among three ladies as to which had the most beautiful
hands. One sat by a stream, and dipped her hand into the water and held
it up; another plucked strawberries until the ends of her fingers were
pink; and a third gathered violets until her hands were fragrant. An
old, haggard woman, passing by, asked, "Who will give me a gift, for I
am poor?" all three denied her; but another who sat near, unwashed in
the stream, unstained with fruit, unadorned with flowers or perfume,
gave her a little gift, and satisfied the poor woman. Then the woman
asked them what was the subject of their dispute; and they told her, and
lifted up before her their beautiful hands. "Beautiful indeed!" she
exclaimed, as she saw them. But when they asked her which was the most
beautiful, she said: "It is not the hand that is washed clean in the
brook; it is not the hand that is coloured with crimson tints; it is not
the hand that is perfumed with fragrant flowers; but the hand that gives
to the poor, that is the most beautiful."

TRUE HAPPINESS.

     True happiness
     Consists not in the multitude of friends,
     But in the worth and choice: nor would I have
     Them popular:
     Let them be good that love me, though but few.

                                             --_Ben Jonson._


825

Happiness consists in being perfectly satisfied with what we have got,
and with what we haven't got.


826

Happiness consists not in possessing much, but in being content with
what we possess. He who wants little, always has enough.


827

A cottage will hold as much happiness as would stock a palace.

                                               --_Hamilton._


828

With "gentleness" his own character, "comfort" in his house, and "good
temper" in his wife, the earthly felicity of man may be said to be
complete.

                                        --_From the German._


829

     What dangers threaten a great reputation!
     Far happier the man of lowly station.


830

We are happy in this world just in proportion as we make others happy.


831

A HAPPY COUPLE.

I think you the happiest couple in the world; for you are not only happy
in one another, but happy in yourselves, and by yourselves.

832

Surely happiness is reflective, like the light of heaven; and every
countenance bright with smiles, and glowing with innocent enjoyment, is
a mirror transmitting to others the rays of a supreme and ever-shining
benevolence.

                                      --_Washington Irving._


833

To rejoice in the happiness of others is to make it our own; to produce
it, is to make it more than our own. There is happiness in the very wish
to make others happy.

                                           --_Dr. Chalmers._


834

Unmixed happiness is not to be found in this world.


835

Hatred always hurts the hater most of all.


836

It is the nature of the human disposition to hate him whom you have
injured.

                                                --_Tacitus._


837

I am almost frozen by the distance you are from me.


838

If a man makes me keep my distance, the comfort is, he keeps his at the
same time.

Health is rightly appreciated only when we are sick.

840

A man too busy to take care of his health is like a mechanic too busy to
take care of his tools.


841

     He that is well does not know how rich he is.
     Better a healthy beggar, than a sick king.

                                         --_German Proverb._


842

It is better to have less wealth and more health.


843

Health is so necessary to all duties, as well as pleasures of life, that
the crime of squandering it is equal to the folly.


844

HEALTH.

                           Thou chiefest good,

845

The only way for a rich man to be healthy is, by exercise and
abstinence, to live as if he were poor.

A BROKEN HEART.

Dr. Mitchell of Philadelphia, in lecturing to his pupils upon the
diseases of the heart, narrated an anecdote to prove that the expression
"broken heart" was not merely figurative. On one occasion, in the early
period of his life, he accompanied, as surgeon, a packet that sailed
from Liverpool to one of the American ports. The captain frequently
conversed with him respecting a lady who had promised to become his
bride on his return from that voyage. Upon this subject he evinced great
warmth of feeling, and showed Dr. Mitchell some costly jewels,
ornaments, etc., which he intended to present as bridal presents. On
reaching his destination, he was abruptly informed that the lady had
married some one else. Instantly the captain was observed to clap his
hand to his breast, and fall heavily to the ground. He was taken up, and
conveyed to his cabin on board the vessel. Dr. Mitchell was immediately
summoned; but, before he reached the poor captain, he was dead. A
postmortem examination revealed the cause of his unfortunate disease.
His heart was found literally torn in twain! The tremendous propulsion
of blood, consequent upon such a violent nervous shock, forced the
powerful muscle tissues asunder, and life was at an end. The heart was
broken.


848

Every heart has its secret sorrow, which the world knows not; and
oftentimes we call a man cold when he is only sad.


849

PARTING.

     To know, to esteem, to love,--and then to part,
     Makes up life's tale to many a feeling heart.

                                              --_Coleridge._


850

Some men's hearts are as great as the world, and still have no room in
them to hold the memory of a wrong.


851

How small is the human heart, and yet even there, God enters in.


852

A ROYAL HEART.

     Ragged, uncomely, and old and gray,
       A woman walked in a Scottish town;
     And through the crowd, as she wound her way,
       One saw her loiter and then stoop down,
       Putting something away in her old, torn gown.
     "You are hiding a jewel!" the watcher said--
     (Ah, that was her heart, had the truth been read.)
     "What have you stolen?" he asked again;
     Then the dim eyes filled with a sudden pain,
     And under the flickering light of the gas
     She showed him her gleaning. "It's broken glass,"
     She said. "I hae lifted it up frae the street
     To be oot o' the rood o' the bairnies' feet!"
     Under the fluttering rags astir
       That was a royal heart that beat!
     Would that the world had more like her
       Smoothing the road for its bairnies' feet!

                                          --_W. H. Ogilvie._


853

IS IT INSTINCT?

     Ye who know the reason, tell me
       How is it that instinct
     Prompts the heart to like or not like
       At its own capricious will?
     Tell me by what hidden magic
       Our impressions first are led
     Into liking or disliking,
       Oft before a word is said?

     Why should smiles sometimes repel us?
       Bright eyes turn our feelings cold?
     What is it that comes to tell us
       All that glitters is not gold?
     Oh! no feature, plain or striking,
       But a power we cannot shun
     Prompts our liking and disliking,
       Ere acquaintance hath begun.

     Is it instinct? or some spirit
       Which protects us, and controls
     Every impulse we inherit,
       By some sympathy of souls?
     Is it instinct? is it nature?
       Or some freak or fault of chance,
     Which our liking or disliking
       Limits to a single glance?

     Like presentiment of danger,
       Though the sky no shadow flings;
     Or that inner sense, still stranger,
       Of unseen, unuttered things?
     Is it? oh! can no one tell me,
       No one show sufficient cause
     Why our likings and dislikings
       Have their own instinctive laws?

_The Bitterness of Estrangement._--To be estranged from one whom we have
tenderly and constantly loved, is one of the bitterest trials the heart
can ever know.

855

There is no place where weeds do not grow, and there is no heart where
errors are not to be found.


856

We open the hearts of others when we open our own.


857

Earth hath nothing more tender than a woman's heart, when it is the
abode of piety.


858

     And yet when all is thought and said,
     The heart still overrules the head.


859

The All-Seeing Eye, whom the sun, moon and stars obey, and under whose
watchful care even comets perform their stupendous revolutions--pervades
the inmost recesses of the human heart, and will reward us according to
our merits.


860

There's many a good bit o' work done with a sad heart.


861

     To meet, to know, to love--and then to part,
     Is the sad tale of many a human heart.

The heart is a small thing, but desireth great matters. It is not
sufficient for a kite's (bird of the hawk kind) dinner, yet the whole
world is not sufficient for it.

MY HEART.

     The heart resembles the ocean! has storm, and ebb and flow;
     And many a beautiful pearl lies hid in its depths below.

     The turnpike-road to people's hearts, I find,
     Lies through their mouths; or I mistake mankind.

865

     The merry heart goes all the day,
     While a sad one tires in a mile-a.

866

DISSENSION BETWEEN HEARTS.

     Alas! how slight a cause may move
     Dissension between hearts that love--
     Hearts that the world in vain had tried,
     And sorrow but more closely tied;
     That stood the storm when waves were rough,
     Yet in a sunny hour fell off,
     Like ships that have gone down at sea,
     When the ocean was all tranquility!
     A something light as air--a look--
     A word unkind or wrongly taken;
     Oh, love that tempests never shook,
       A breath--a touch like this hath shaken.

                                           --_Thomas Moore._


867

Men, as well as women, are much oftener led by their hearts than by
their understandings; indeed nine times in ten it is so.

HEAVEN.

     If God hath made this world so fair,
       Where sin and death abound,
     How beautiful, beyond compare,
       Will Paradise be found!

                                             --_Montgomery._


868a

     Let others seek earth's honors; be it mine
     One law to cherish, and to track one line--
     Straight on towards heaven to press with single bent,
     To know and love my God, and then to die content.

                                                 --_Newman._


869

Many a man who prides himself on doing a cash business, regards his
debts to Heaven with indifference.


870

THE DELIGHTS OF HEAVEN.

"Of the positive joys of heaven we can form no conception; but its
negative delights form a sufficiently attractive picture,--no pain; no
thirst; no hunger; no horror of the past; no fear of the future; no
failure of mental capacity; no intellectual deficiency; no morbid
imaginations; no follies; no stupidities; but above all, no insulted
feelings; no wounded affections; no despised love or unrequited regard;
no hate, envy, jealousy, or indignation of or at others; no falsehood,
dishonesty, dissimulation, hypocrisy, grief or remorse. In a word," said
Professor Wilson, "to end where I began, no sin and no suffering."


871

BELIEVE AND LIVE.

     O how unlike the complex works of man,
     Heaven's easy, artless, unencumbered plan!
     No clustering ornaments to clog the pile;
     From ostentation, as from weakness free,
     It stands majestic in its own simplicity.
     Inscribed above the portal, from afar,
     Conspicuous as the brightness of a star,
     Legible only by the light they give,
     Stand the soul-quickening words--Believe and Live.
     Too many, shocked at what should charm them most,
     Despise the plain direction, and are lost.
     Heaven on such terms! (they cry with proud disdain,)
     Incredible impossible, and vain!
     Rebel, because 'tis easy to obey;
     And scorn, for its own sake, the gracious way.


872

IS THAT ALSO THINE?

A beautiful reply is recorded of a peasant, whose master was displaying
to him the grandeur of his estates. Farms, houses, and forests were
pointed out in succession, on every hand, as the property of the rich
proprietor, who summed up finally by saying, "In short, all that you can
see, in every direction, belongs to me." The poor man looked thoughtful
for a moment; then, pointing up to heaven, solemnly replied, "And is
_that_, also, thine?"


873

THE BETTER LAND.

     "I hear thee speak of the better land,
     Thou callest its children a happy band:
     Mother! oh where is that radiant shore?
     Shall we not seek it and weep no more?
     Is it where the flower of the orange blows,
     And the fire-flies glance through the myrtle boughs?"
         "Not there, not there, my child!"

     "Is it where the feathery palm trees rise,
     And the date grows ripe under sunny skies?
     Or 'midst the green islands of glittering seas,
     Where fragrant forests perfume the breeze,
     And strange, bright birds, on their starry wings
     Bear the rich hues of all glorious things?"
         "Not there, not there, my child!"

     "Is it far away, in some region old,
     Where the rivers wander o'er sands of gold?--
     Where the burning rays of the ruby shine,
     And the diamond lights up the secret mine,
     And the pearl gleams forth from the coral strand?
     Is it there, sweet mother, that better land?"
         "Not there, not there, my child!"

     "Eye hath not seen it, my gentle boy!
     Ear hath not heard its deep songs of joy;
     Dreams cannot picture a world so fair--
     Sorrow and death may not enter there;
     Time doth not breathe on its fadeless bloom,
     For beyond the clouds and beyond the tomb,

HOME.

     Cling to thy home! if there the meanest shed
     Yield thee a hearth and shelter for thy head,
     And some poor plot, with vegetables stored,
     Be all that Heaven allots thee for thy board,--
     Unsavory bread, and herbs that scattered grow
     Wild on the river brink or mountain brow,
     Yet e'en this cheerless mansion shall provide
     More heart's repose than all the world beside.

DEFINITIONS OF "HOME."

Having offered a prize for the best definition of "Home," London
_Tit-Bits_ recently received more than five thousand answers. Among
those which were adjudged the best were the definitions as follows:

     A world of strife shut out, a world of love shut in.

     Home is the blossom of which heaven is the fruit.

     The best place for a married man after business hours.

     Home is the coziest, kindliest, sweetest place in all the
     world; the scene of our purest earthly joys, and deepest
     sorrows.

     The place where the great are sometimes small, and the small
     often great.

     The father's kingdom, the children's paradise, the mother's
     world.


881

The ornaments of a home are the friends who frequent it.

                                                --_Emerson._

God hath often a great share in a little house, and but a little share
in a great one.


883

Home is the grandest of all institutions.

884

     Stay, stay at home, my heart, and rest;
     Home-keeping hearts are happiest,
     For those that wander they know not where
     Are full of trouble, and full of care;
         To stay at home is best.

There's little pleasure in the house when our gudeman's awa'.

                                           --_W. J. Mickle._


886

How many fine, well furnished and pretentious houses we now see around
us, occupied and owned by successful people, in which there is hardly a
market-basket full of books! Evidently showing that the material is of
more importance than the intellectual.

887

We neglect the things which are placed before our eyes, and regardless
of what is within our reach, we pursue whatever is remote. This is
frequently and properly applied to the rage for visiting foreign
countries, in those who are absolutely unacquainted with their own.

     Abroad to see wonders the traveler goes,
     And neglects the fine things which lie under his nose.

A man without a home is like a bird without a nest.

HOME--DEVOID OF LOVE.

     He enter'd in his house--his home no more,
     For without hearts there is no home--and felt
     The solitude of passing his own door
     Without a welcome.

THAT LAND THY COUNTRY.

     There is a land, of every land the pride,
     Beloved by Heaven o'er all the world beside;
     Where brighter suns dispense serener light,
     And milder moons emparadise the night;--
     There is a spot of earth supremely blest,
     A dearer, sweeter spot than all the rest
     Where man, creation's tyrant, casts aside
     His sword and sceptre, pageantry and pride,
     While in his softened looks benignly blend
     The sire, the son, the husband, brother, friend;--
     "Where shall that land, that spot of earth, be found?"
     Art thou a man?--a patriot?--look around!
     O, thou shalt find, where'er thy footsteps roam,
     That land thy country, and that spot thy home!

                                       --_Sir Walter Scott._

It is a great happiness, if after being absent from home for a time you
find no troubles awaiting your return.

     'Tis sweet to hear the watch-dog's honest bark

     'Tis sweet to know there is an eye will mark
     Our coming, and look brighter when we come.

                                                  --_Byron._

     My house, my house, though thou art small,
     Thou art to me a palace.

TRUE NATURE OF HOME.

This is the true nature of home--it is the place of Peace; the shelter
not only from all injury, but from all terror, doubt and division. In so
far as it is not this, it is not home; so far as the anxieties of the
outer life penetrate into it * * * it ceases to be home; it is then only
a part of that outer world which you have roofed over and lighted fire
in.

                                            --_John Ruskin._


901

THE WANDERER'S RETURN.

     He seeks the tranquil scenes of early days,
       Leaving the dazzling haunts of vain ambition;
     And now, he longs to meet a kindly gaze
       And hear a warm and cheering recognition.

     How changed he seems! Though still in manhood's prime,
       Long hath he striven with care, want, and danger;
     Their iron grasp has wrought the work of Time,
       And all who view him, deem him as a stranger.

     He meets with one who knew him when a boy:
       How oft, beneath yon trees, in summer weather,
     They sat, and pictured scenes of future joy,
       When they should tread the far-off world together!

     They stand upon the old familiar spot:
       One feels long vanished memories steal o'er him;
     The other sees, yet recognizes not
       His blithe companion in the form before him.

     Next comes a friend who in his wavering youth
       His footsteps had upheld with patient guiding;
     Wise in his counsel, steadfast in his truth,
       Prompt in his praise, and gracious in his chiding.

     Hath he, indeed, discarded from his mind
       The object of his care and admonition?
     He hath not--yet he casts no glance behind;
       The wanderer fails to make his recognition.

     What, doth his image live indeed with none?
       Have all expelled him from their recollection?
     Lo! a sweet lady comes--the cherished one
       To whom he breathed his vows of young affection.

     He views her--she has lost the airy grace
       And mantling bloom that won his boyish duty;
     And yet a winning charm pervades her face,
       In the calm radiance of its mellowed beauty.

     Can she forget? Though others pass him by,
       Failing his former features to discover,
     Will not her faithful heart instruct her eye
       To recognize her dear, her long-lost lover?

     Oh! in that grief-worn man, no trace remains
       Of the gay, gallant youth from whom she parted;
     A brief and careless glance alone she deigns
       To the poor sufferer, chilled and broken-hearted;

     Who feels as though condemned to lead henceforth
       A strange, a sad, a separate existence,
     Gazing awhile on those he loves on earth,
       But to behold them fading in the distance.

     Lo! a pale matron comes, with quiet pace,
       And aspect of subdued and gentle sadness;--
     Fondly she clasps him in a warm embrace,
       And greets him with a burst of grateful gladness!

     "Praise be to Heaven!" the weary wanderer cries,
       "All human love is not a mocking vision:
     Through every change, in every varied guise,
       The son still claims his mother's recognition!"

                          --_From the Danish, by Mrs. Abdy._


902

HOME.

     Home's not merely four square walls,
       Though with pictures hung and gilded;
     Home is where affection calls,
       Filled with shrines the heart hath builded!
     Home! go watch the faithful dove,
       Sailing 'neath the heaven above us;
     Home is where there's one to love!
       Home is where there's one to love us!

     Home's not merely roof and room,
       It needs something to endear it;
     Home is where the heart can bloom,
       Where there's some kind lip to cheer it!

     What is home with none to meet,
       None to welcome, none to greet us?
     Home is sweet,--and only sweet--
       When there's one we love to meet us.


903

Beware of those who are homeless by choice! You have no hold on a human
being whose affections are without a tap-root!

     I am as homeless as the wind that moans
     And wanders through the streets.

905

GIVE GOOD MEASURE.

When I was a young man, there lived in our neighborhood one who was
universally reported to be a very liberal man, and uncommonly upright in
his dealings. When he had any of the produce of his farm to dispose of,
he made it an invariable rule to give good measure, over good, rather
more than could be required of him. One of his friends, observing him
frequently doing so, questioned him why he did it, told him he gave too
much, and said it would not be to his own advantage. Now mark the answer
of this man. "God Almighty has permitted me but one journey through the
world; and when gone I cannot return to rectify mistakes."


906

To be honest and faithful is to belong to the only aristocracy in the
world--and the smallest.

                                        --_Israel Zangwill._


907

COMMERCIAL HONESTY.

On one occasion the first Napoleon being informed that a certain army
contractor had cheated the government by supplying the troops with very
inferior and insufficient food, sent for him to inquire into the affair.
"How is this?" said the Emperor: "I understand you have been violating
your contract." "Sire," was the answer, "I must live." "No," replied the
monarch, "I do not see the _must_. It is not necessary that you should
live; but it is necessary that you should do right."


908

Too much assertion gives ground of suspicion; truth and honesty have no
need of loud protestations.


909

REUBEN AND SANDY.

Can any one who was present ever forget the broken voice and streaming
tears with which he (Dean Stanley) told the story of two little Scotch
boys, Reuben and Sandy? The story was as follows: "On a cold winter day,
a gentleman in Edinburgh had, out of pity, bought a box of matches from
a poor, little, shivering boy, and, as he had no pence, had given him a
shilling, of which the change was to be brought to his hotel. Hours
passed by, and the boy did not return. Very late in the evening a mere
child came to the hotel. 'Are you the gentleman that bought the matches
frae Sandy?' 'Yes.' 'Well, then, here's fourpence out o' yer' shillin';
Sandy canna come. He's verra ill. A cart ran over him and knocked him
doon, and he lost his bonnet and his matches and yer sevenpence, and
baith his legs are broken, and the doctor says he'll dee; and that's
a'.' And then, putting down the fourpence on the table, the poor child
burst into great sobs. 'So I fed the little man,' said the narrator;
'and I went with him to see Sandy. The two little things were living
almost alone; their father and mother were dead. Poor Sandy was lying on
a bundle of shavings. He knew me as soon as I came in, and said, 'I got
the change, sir, and was coming back, and then the cart knocked me down,
and both my legs were broken; and oh, Reuby, little Reuby, I am sure I
am dying, and who will take care of you when I am gone? What will ye
do?' 'I took his hand, and said I would always take care of Reuby. He
understood me, and had just strength enough to look up as if to thank
me; the light went out of his blue eyes. In a moment,

     He lay within the light of God,
       Like a babe upon the breast,
     Where the wicked cease from troubling
       And the weary are at rest.'"

_Honesty._--If he does really think that there is no distinction between
virtue and vice, why sir, when he leaves our houses let us count our
spoons.

He, the Duke of Devonshire, was not a man of superior abilities, but was
a man strictly faithful to his word. If, for instance, he had promised
you an acorn, and none had grown that year in his woods, he would not
have contented himself with that excuse: he would have sent to Denmark
for it, so unconditional was he in keeping his word--so high as to the
point of honor.

Honor is like the eye which cannot suffer the least injury without
damage; it is a precious stone, the price of which is lessened by the
least flaw.

914

JUDICIAL HONOR.

A poor man claimed a house which a rich man had seized. The former
produced his deeds and instruments to prove his right, but the latter
had provided a number of witnesses; and, to support their evidence the
more effectually, he secretly presented the cadi with a bag containing
five hundred ducats, which the cadi received. When it came to a hearing,
the poor man told his story and produced his writings, but lacked
witnesses. The other, provided with witnesses, laid his whole stress on
them and on his adversary's defective law, who could produce none; he,
therefore, urged the cadi to give sentence in his favor. After the most
pressing solicitations, the judge calmly drew from beneath his sofa the
bag of five hundred ducats, which the rich man had given him as a bribe,
saying to him very gravely, "You have been much mistaken in the suit;
for if the poor man could produce no witnesses in confirmation of his
right, I, myself, can furnish him with at least five hundred." He threw
him the bag with reproach and indignation and decreed the house to the
poor plaintiff.

HOME.

                                           We leave
     Our home in youth--no matter to what end--
     Study--or strife--or pleasure, or what not;
     And coming back in few short years, we find
     All as we left it outside: the old elms,
     The house, the grass, gates, and latchet's self-same click:
           But, lift that latchet,--
                   Alas! all is changed as doom.

CHILDREN IN THE HOUSE.

     Lady, the sun's light to our eyes is dear,
     And fair the tranquil reaches of the sea,
     And flowery earth in May, and bounding waters;
     And so right many fair things I might praise;
     Yet nothing is so radiant and so fair
     As for souls childless, with desire sore-smitten,
     To see the light of babes about the house.

invited. They may be invited on purpose to abuse him"--smiling.

HUSBAND--EXCELLENCIES OF A.

     Faithful--as dog, the lonely shepherd's pride;
     True--as the helm, the bark's protecting guide;
     Firm--as the shaft that props the towering dome;
     Sweet--as to shipwreck'd seaman land and home;
     Lovely--as child, a parent's sole delight;
     Radiant--as morn, that breaks a stormy night;
     Grateful--as streams, that, in some deep recess,
     With rills unhoped the panting traveler bless,
     Is he that links with mine his chain of life,
     Names himself lord, and deigns to call me wife.

WHAT A SONG DID.

A Scottish youth learned, with a pious mother, to sing the old psalms
that were then as household words to them in the kirk (church) and by
the fireside. When he had grown up he wandered away from his native
country, was taken captive by the Turks, and made a slave in one of the
Barbary States. But he never forgot the songs of Zion, although he sang
them in a strange land and to heathen ears.

One night he was solacing himself in this manner when the attention of
some sailors on board of a British man-of-war was directed to the
familiar tune of "Old Hundred" as it came floating over the moonlit
waves.

At once they surmised the truth that one of their countrymen was
languishing away his life as a captive. Quickly arming themselves, they
manned a boat and lost no time in effecting his release. What joy to him
after eighteen long years passed in slavery! Is it strange that he ever
afterwards cherished the glorious tune of "Old Hundred?"

     Pervading worlds, hath reached my bosom too.
     Yes, in my spirit doth Thy spirit shine,
     As shines the sunbeam in a drop of dew.
     Naught! But I live, and on Hope's pinions fly
     Eager toward Thy presence; for in Thee,
     I live, and breathe, and dwell, aspiring high,
     Even to the throne of Thy divinity.
     I am, O God, and surely Thou must be!

LONGING AFTER IMMORTALITY.

     It must be so--Plato, thou reasonest well!--
     Else whence this pleasing hope, this fond desire,
     This longing after immortality?
     Or whence this secret dread, and inward horror,
     Of falling into naught? Why shrinks the soul
     Back on herself, and startles at destruction?
     'Tis the Divinity that stirs within us;
     'Tis Heaven itself that points out an hereafter,
     And intimates eternity to man.
     The stars shall fade away, the sun himself
     Grow dim with age, and nature sink in years,
     But thou shalt flourish in immortal youth,
     Unhurt amidst the war of elements,
     The wreck of matter, and the crush of worlds.

BEGIN IT.

     Lose this day loitering, 'twill be the same story

     True indecision brings its own delays.
     And days are lost, lamenting over days.
     Are you in earnest? Seize the very minute;
     What you can do, or think you can, begin it;

     Only begin it and the mind grows heated;
     Begin it, and the work will be completed.--

THE INEVITABLE.

     I like the man who faces what he must,
     With steps triumphant and a heart of cheer;
     Who fights the daily battle without fear;
     Sees his hopes fail, yet keeps unfaltering trust
     That God is God, that somehow, true and just,
     His plans work out for mortals; not a tear
     Is shed when fortune, which the world holds dear,
     Falls from his grasp; better with love a crust
     Than living in dishonor; envies not,
     Nor loses faith in man; but does his best,
     Nor murmurs at his humble lot;
     But with a smile and words of hope, give zest
     To every toiler. He alone is great
     Who by a life heroic conquers fate.

THE NEW-COMER.

     The hour arrives, the moment wished and feared,
     The child is born, by many a pang endeared;
     And now the mother's ear has caught his cry;
     O! grant the cherub to her asking eye!
     He comes, she clasps him, to her bosom pressed,
     He drinks the balm of life, and drops to rest.
     She, by her smile, how soon the stranger knows;
     How soon by his the glad discovery shows!
     As to her lips she lifts the lovely boy,
     What answering looks of sympathy and joy!
     He walks--he speaks--in many a broken word,
     His wants, his wishes, and his griefs are heard;
     And ever, ever to her lap he flies,
     Where rosy sleep comes on with sweet surprise,
     Locked in her arms, his arms across her flung,
     That name most dear forever on his tongue.
     As with soft accents round her neck he clings,
     And cheek to cheek her lulling song she sings,
     How blest to feel the beating of his heart,
     Breathe his sweet breath, and kiss for kiss impart,
     Watch o'er his slumbers, like the brooding dove,
     And if she can, exhaust a mother's love!

NO ONE SHOULD BE BLAMED FOR HIS INFIRMITIES.

A hound, who in the days of his youth and strength had never yielded to
any beast of the forest, encountered in his old age a boar in the chase.
He seized him boldly by the ear, but could not retain his hold because
of the decay of his teeth, so that the boar escaped. His master, quickly
coming up, fiercely abused the dog. The hound looked up and said: "It
was not my fault, master; my spirit was as good as ever, but I could not
help mine infirmities. I rather deserve to be praised for what I have
been, than to be blamed for what I am."

PERSONAL INFLUENCE.

"On a cold winter evening," said Dr. T. L. Cuyler recently, "I made my
first call on a rich merchant in New York. As I left the door and the
piercing gale swept in, I said:

"What an awful night for the poor?

"He said come back for a moment; and in a very few minutes brought me a
roll of bank bills, and said:

"Please hand these for me to the poorest people you know.

"After a few days I wrote him the grateful thanks of the poor whom his
bounty had relieved, and added:

"How is it that a man so kind to his fellow creatures has always been so
unkind to his Saviour as to refuse him his heart?

"That sentence touched him to the core.

"He sent for me to come and talk to him, and speedily gave himself to
Christ. He has been a most useful Christian ever since. But he told me I
was the first person who had talked to him about his soul in twenty
years. One hour of work did more for that man than the pulpit effort of
a life-time."

HIS MOTHER'S INFLUENCE.

It is reported that a young man being examined preparatory to joining
the church was asked--"Under whose preaching?" The prompt reply--"I was
converted under my mother's practising." Did any preacher ever utter so
powerful a sermon as the young man embodied in those few words?

     Some grave their wrongs on marble; He more just,
     Stooped down serene, and wrote them on the dust;
     Trod under foot, the sport of every wind,

     There, secret in the grave, He bade them lie,
     And grieved they could not escape the Almighty's eye.

POLITICAL INTEGRITY.

The borough of Hull, in the reign of Charles II, chose Andrew Marvell, a
young gentleman of little or no fortune, and maintained him in London
for the service of the public. With a view to bribe him, his old
school-fellow, the Lord Treasurer Danby, went to him in his garret. At
parting, the Lord Treasurer slipped into his hands an order upon the
treasury for L1000, and then went into his chariot. Marvell looking at
the paper, called after the treasurer--"My lord, I request another
moment." They went up again to the garret, and the servant boy was
called--"What had I for dinner yesterday?" "Don't you remember, sir, you
had the little shoulder of mutton that you ordered me to bring from a
woman in the market?" "Very right. What have I for dinner today?" "Don't
you know, sir, that you made me lay up the blade-bone to broil?" "'Tis
so; very right. Go away." "My lord, do you hear that? Andrew Marvell's
dinner is provided; there's your piece of paper, I want it not. I knew
the sort of kindness you intended. I live here to serve my constituents.
The ministry may seek men for their purpose; I am not one."

MOTHER'S JEWELS.

A lady who was very rich, and fond of pomp and show, after having
displayed, in a visit she made, her diamonds, pearls, and richest
jewels, earnestly desired Cornelia, the illustrious, to let her see her
jewels also. Cornelia dexterously turned the conversation to another
subject, to wait the return of her sons, who were gone to the public
schools. When they returned and entered their mother's apartment, she
said to the rich lady, pointing to them with her hand, "These are my
jewels, and the only ornaments I admire."

_Johnson_: "It is commonly a weak man who marries for love." We then
talked of marrying women of fortune; and I (Boswell) mentioned a common
remark, that a man may be, upon the whole, richer by marrying a woman
with a very small portion, because a woman of fortune will be
proportionally expensive; whereas a woman who brings none will be very
moderate in expenses. _Johnson_: "Depend upon it, Sir, this is not true.
A woman of fortune, being used to the handling of money, spends it
judiciously; but a woman who gets the command of money for the first
time upon her marriage, has such a gust in spending it, that she throws
it away with great profusion."

A CONSCIENTIOUS JUDGE.

Sir Matthew Hale was very exact and impartial in his administration of
justice. One of the first peers of England went once to his chamber and
told him--"That having a suit in law to be tried before him, he was
there to acquaint him with it, that he might the better understand it
when he should come to be heard in court." Upon which Sir Matthew
interrupted him, and said--"He did not deal fairly to come to his
chamber about such affairs, for he never received any information of
causes but in open court, where both parties were to be heard alike," so
he would not suffer him to go on. Whereupon his grace (for he was a
Duke) went away not a little dissatisfied, and complained of it to the
king, as a rudeness that was not to be endured. But his majesty bade him
content himself that he was no worse used, and said--"He verily believed
he would have used himself no better, if he had gone to solicit him in
any of his own causes."

In the _Gentleman's Magazine_ for September, 1797, published in London,
there appears a letter which shows Benjamin Franklin, the philosopher,
in the character of a creditor. The letter, which was written in Paris,
is as follows:--


                                             April 22, 1784.

     I send you herewith a bill for ten louis d'ors. I do not
     pretend to give such a sum. I only lend it to you. When you
     shall return to your country you cannot fail of getting into
     some business that will in time enable you to pay all your
     debts. In that case, when you meet with another honest man in
     similar distress you must pay me by lending this sum to him,
     enjoining him to discharge the debt by a like operation when
     he shall be able, and shall meet with such another
     opportunity. I hope it may thus go through many hands before
     it meets with a knave to stop its progress. This is a trick of
     mine for doing a deal of good with a little money. I am not
     rich enough to afford much in good works, and so am obliged to
     be cunning and make the most of a little.


1035

     If none were sick and none were sad,
     We scarcely would be tender.

GRATITUDE OF AN INDIAN CHIEF.

A Scotch Highlander was taken prisoner by a tribe of Indians; his life
was about to be sacrificed, when the chief adopted him as his son. They
carried him into the interior; he learnt their language, assumed their
habits, and became skillful in the use of their arms. After a season the
same tribe began their route to join the French army, at that time
opposed to the British. It was necessary to pass near to the British
lines during the night. Very early in the morning, and it was spring,
the old chief roused the young Highlander from his repose: he took him
to an eminence, and pointed out to him the tents of his countrymen. The
old man appeared to be dreadfully agitated, and there was a keen
restlessness in his eye. After a pause--"I lost," said he, "my only son
in a battle with your nation; are you the only son of your father? And
do you think that your father is yet alive?" The young man replied, "I
am the only son of my father, and I hope that my father is yet alive."
They stood close to a beautiful magnolia in full blossom. The prospect
was grand and enchanting, and all its charms were crowned by the sun,
which had fully emerged from the horizon. The old chief, looking
steadfastly at his companion, exclaimed: "Let thy heart rejoice at the
beauty of the scene! To me it is as the desert; but you are free; return
to your countrymen, revisit your father that he may again rejoice when
he sees the sun rise in the morning, and the trees blossom in the
spring!"


1037

Little acts of kindness are stowed away in the heart, like bags of
lavender in a drawer, to sweeten every object around them.


1038

A good man that has done a kindness never proclaims it, but does another
as soon as he can; much like the vine which is satisfied by being
fruitful in its kind, and bears a bunch of grapes without expecting
thanks for it.


1039

     There's no dearth of kindness
       In this world of ours;
     Only in our blindness
       We gather thorns for flowers.

_Returned Kindness._--When the country near Albany was newly settled, an
Indian came to the inn at Lichfield, and asked for a night's shelter, at
the same time confessing that from failure in hunting he had nothing to
pay. The hostess drove him away with reproachful epithets, and as the
Indian was retiring sorrowfully,--there being no other inn for many a
weary mile,--a man who was sitting by directed the hostess to supply his
wants, and promised to pay her. As soon as his supper was ended, the
Indian thanked his benefactor, and said he would some day repay him.
Several years thereafter the settler was taken a prisoner by a hostile
tribe, and carried off to Canada. However, his life was spared, though
he himself was detained in slavery. But one day an Indian came to him,
and giving him a musket, bade the captive follow him. The Indian never
told where they were going, nor what was his object; but day after day
the captive followed his mysterious guide, till one afternoon they came
suddenly on a beautiful expanse of cultivated fields, with many houses
rising amongst them. "Do you know that place?" asked the Indian. "Ah,
yes--it is Lichfield!" and whilst the astonished exile had not recovered
his surprise and amazement, the Indian exclaimed--"And I am the starving
Indian on whom at this very place you took pity. And now that I have
paid for my supper, I pray you go home!"

Getting money is not all a man's business: to cultivate kindness, is a
valuable part of the business of life.

1044

A more glorious victory cannot be gained over another man than this:
that when the injury began on his part, the kindness shall begin on
ours.

     If you grant a favor, forget it;
     If you receive one, remember it.

DEFINITIONS OF A KISS.

The seal that stamps many a future.

A woman's most effective argument.

A kiss of the lips does not always touch the heart.

     And sweet the music of the step

no shade when we grow old.

knowledge, replied, "By not being prevented by shame from asking
questions respecting things of which I was ignorant."

Men may acquire knowledge, but not wisdom. Some of the greatest fools

LABOR.

The beauty and blessedness of labor are finely presented by John
Greenleaf Whittier:--

     Give fools their gold, and knaves their power;
       Let fortune's bubbles rise and fall;
     Who sows a field, or trains a flower,
       Or plants a tree, is more than all.

     For he who blesses most is blest;
       And God and man shall own his worth
     Who toils to leave, as his bequest
       An added beauty to the earth.


1064

Genius begins great works; labor alone finishes them.


1065

The fruit derived from labor is the sweetest of all pleasures.

                                           --_Vauvenargues._


1066

I have also seen the world, and after long experience have discovered
that ennui is our greatest enemy, and remunerative labor our most
lasting friend.

LABOR.

Some relaxation is necessary to people of every degree; the head that
thinks, and the hand that labors, must have some little time to recruit
their diminished powers.

                                                 --_Gilpin._


1068

None so little enjoy life, and are such burdens to themselves, as those
who have nothing to do. The active only have the true relish of life. He
who knows not what it is to labor, knows not what it is to enjoy. It is
exertion that renders rest delightful, and sleep sweet, and undisturbed.

A LABORING SCARECROW.

Two old farmers were walking up a road near Dunfermline, when one of the
pair, shading his eyes from the sun, pointed to a distant field and
said:

"I wonder if that figure over there is a scarecrow."

He paused and considered the matter for a while, and then, in a
satisfied tone, concluded:

"Yes, it must be a scarecrow; it's not moving."

But the other Scot had a sharper pair of eyes, and perhaps a better
understanding of human nature.

"No," he said, dryly, "it's not a scarecrow; it's only a man working by
the day."

ADVICE TO A YOUNG LADY.

The Rev. Mr. Berridge being once visited by a loquacious young lady,
who, forgetting the modesty of her sex, and the superior gravity of an
aged divine, engrossed all the conversation of the interview with small
talk concerning herself. When she rose to retire, he said, "Madam,
before you withdraw, I have one piece of advice to give you; and that
is, when you go into company again, after you have talked _half an hour_
without intermission, I recommend it to you to stop awhile, and see if
any other of the company has anything to say."

SCOTCH STUDENT AS LAMPLIGHTER.

Many hardships endured by students attending university or college in
Scotland have been brought to light from time to time. A student of
Anderson's Medical College some years ago fulfilled the duties of
lamplighter during his spare hours in a neighboring burgh. He had no
other income than the few shillings he received weekly for lighting,
extinguishing and cleaning the burgh lamps, and from this he paid his
college fees and kept himself fairly respectable. On one occasion he
applied for an increase of wages, and was called before the committee.
One of the bailies remarked that an able-bodied healthy-looking young
man like the applicant, might find some other employment instead of
wasting his time as he was doing. The application for an increase was
refused. One may conceive the bailie's surprise at a subsequent meeting
when the town clerk read a letter from the lamplighter, tendering his
resignation, as he had passed his final examination as a fully qualified
doctor.

ORIGIN OF LANGUAGE.

Talking of the origin of language,--_Johnson_: "It must have come by
inspiration. A thousand, nay, a million of children could not invent a
language. While the organs are pliable, there is not understanding
enough to form a language; by the time that there is understanding
enough, the organs are become stiff. We know that after a certain age we
cannot learn to pronounce a new language. No foreigner who comes to
England when advanced in life, ever pronounces English tolerably well;
at least such instances are very rare. When I maintain that language
must have come by inspiration, I do not mean that inspiration is
required for rhetoric, and all the beauties of language; for when once
man has language, we can conceive that he may gradually form
modifications of it. I mean only that inspiration seems to me to be
necessary to give man the faculty of speech; to inform him that he may
have speech; which I think he could no more find out without inspiration
than cows or hogs would think of such a faculty."

FOLLY OF GOING TO LAW.

To go to law is for two persons to kindle a fire at their own cost to
warm others, and singe themselves to cinders; and because they cannot
agree as to what is truth and equity, they will both agree to unplume
themselves, that others may be decorated with their feathers.

He that goes to law for a sheep will be apt to lose a cow.

     A lawyer's office is, I'm sure you'll find,
     Just like a mill, whereto for grinding come
     A crowd of folk of every sort and kind.


1087

REQUISITES FOR GOING TO LAW.

     Wisely has it been said--that he who would go to law,
                 Must have a _good_ cause,
                 A _good_ purse,
                 A _good_ attorney,
                 _Good_ evidence
                 And a _good_ judge and jury--and having
     all these _goods_, unless he has also _good luck_, he will stand
     but a _bad_ chance of success.

In a lawsuit nothing is certain but the expense.

The Talmud says that when a man once asked Shamai to teach him the law
in one lesson, Shamai drove him away in anger. He then went to Hillel
with the same request. Hillel said, "Do unto others as you would have
others do unto you. This is the whole law; the rest merely commentaries
upon it."

LEAVING THE LAWYERS A MARGIN.

A man from the country applied lately to a respectable solicitor in this
town for legal advice. After detailing the circumstances of the case, he
was asked if he had stated the facts exactly as they occurred. "Ou, ay,
sir," rejoined the applicant, "I thought it best to tell you the plain
truth; ye can put the lees till't yoursel'."

LAWYERS.

     I know you lawyers can, with ease,
     Twist your words and meanings as you please;

     Will bend to favor every client;
     That 'tis the fee directs the sense,
     To make out either side's pretence.

     Two lawyers, when a knotty case was o'er,
     Shook hands, and were as good friends as before.
     "Zounds!" says the losing client, "How come you
     To be such friends, who were such foes just now?"
     "Thou fool," says one, "we lawyers, tho' so keen,
     Like shears, ne'er cut ourselves, but what's between."

Some lawyers have the knack of converting poor advice into good coin.

Laziness grows on people; it begins in cobwebs and ends in iron chains.

AUTUMN LEAVES.

     "Come little leaves," said the wind one day,
     "Come o'er the meadows with me and play;
     Put on your dress of red and gold,
     Summer is gone, and the days grow cold."

     Soon as the leaves heard the wind's loud call
     Down they came fluttering, one and all;
     Over the brown fields they danced and flew,
     Singing the soft little songs that they knew.

     Dancing and whirling the little leaves went,
     Winter had called them, and they were content.
     Soon fast asleep in their earthly beds,
     The snow laid a coverlet over their heads.

GENERAL LEE'S REPLY.

After the Civil War many offers of places of honor and fame came to
General Robert E. Lee. He refused them all, says Thomas Nelson Page, in
his biography of the soldier. The only position which he finally did
accept, was the presidency of Washington College,--now Washington and
Lee University, at Lexington, Virginia, with a small salary.

On one of these occasions, Lee was approached with the tender of the
presidency of an insurance company, at a salary of fifty thousand
dollars a year. He declined it, saying that it was work with which he
was not familiar.

"But, general," said the representative of the insurance company, "you
will not be expected to do any work. What we wish, is the use of your
name."

"Do you not think," said General Lee, "that if my name is worth fifty
thousand dollars a year, I ought to be very careful about taking care of
it?"


1104

Colonel Chesney, of the British Army, said of R. E. Lee: "The day will
come when the evil passions of the great civil war will sleep in
oblivion, and the North and South do justice to each other's motives,
and forget each other's wrongs. Then history will speak with clear voice
of the deeds done on either side, and the citizens of the whole Union do
justice to the memories of the dead, and place above all others the name
of the great Southern chief. In strategy, mighty; in battle, terrible;
in adversity, as in prosperity, a hero indeed; with the simple devotion
to duty and the rare purity of the ideal Christian Knight,--he joined
all the kingly qualities of a leader of men. It is a wondrous future
indeed that lies before America; but in her annals of the years to come,
as in those of the past, there will be found few names that can rival in
unsullied lustre that of the heroic defender of his native
Virginia,--Robert Edward Lee."

     Though safe thou think'st thy treasure lies,

     Yet in a tempest may be lost.

NOT A CANDIDATE.

The following well-merited rebuke by a slave to his master, shows that
persons occupying mean positions in this life are sometimes superior to
those above them.

A gentleman in the enjoyment of wealth, and of high social standing, and
wholly given up to the pleasures of this world, knowing that one of his
slaves was religious, and happening to see him in the garden near the
porch of his house, called him up rather to amuse himself than for any
serious purpose. When the slave came to him, cap in hand, he said, "Tom,
what do you think of me; do you believe I will be one of the elect when
I die?"

With a low obeisance, the slave replied: "Master, I never knew any one
to be elected who was not a candidate."

The master, struck with the gentle but just rebuke of the man's answer,
turned and entered his mansion, and from that hour became a candidate,
living thereafter a good life.

     Life! We've been long together
     Through pleasant and through cloudy weather;
     'Tis hard to part when friends are dear--
     Perhaps 'twill cost a sigh, a tear.
       Then steal away, give little warning,
         Choose thine own time,
     Say not "good-night," but in some brighter clime,
         Bid me "good-morning."

     Nor cup of water given.
     Each tender, loving deed,
     Like some strange, precious seed,
     Shall bear its fruit in heaven.

     Nor dream, if thou wert gone
     From out life's troubled throng
     Thou'dst not be missed.
     Thou knowest not what heart,
     That lives in gloom apart,
     Would find its sunshine fled
     If thou wert dead--
     What slender thread of faith would break
     If thou shouldest prove untrue.

     The flower that blooms in desert place
     And lifts its head with winsome grace,

     Hath formed that flower and called it good,
     And in His wisdom placed it there
     To make the desert seem more fair:
     And if He then hath need of flowers
     To deck this barren world of ours,
     He hath a use for thee!

YOUTH, MANHOOD, OLD AGE.

How small a portion of our life it is, that we really enjoy. In youth,
we are looking forward to things that are to come; in old age, we are
looking backwards to things that are gone past; in manhood, although we
appear indeed to be more occupied in things that are present, yet even
that is too often absorbed in vague determinations to be vastly happy on
some future day, when we have time.

LOVE.

To a man, the disappointment of love may occasion some bitter pangs: it
wounds some feelings of tenderness--it blasts some prospects of
felicity; but he is an active being; he may dissipate his thoughts in
the whirl of varied occupation, or may plunge into the tide of pleasure;
or, if the scene of disappointment be too full of painful associations,
he can shift his abode at will, and taking, as it were, the wings of the
morning, can "fly to the uttermost parts of the earth, and be at rest."

But woman's is comparatively a fixed, a secluded and a meditative life.
She is more the companion of her own thoughts and feelings; and if they
are turned to ministers of sorrow, where shall she look for consolation?
Her lot is to be wooed and won; and if unhappy in her love, her heart is
her world--is like some fortress that has been captured, and sacked, and
abandoned, and left desolate.

Shall I confess it?--I believe in broken hearts, and the possibility of
dying of disappointed love! I do not, however, consider it a malady
often fatal to my own sex; but I firmly believe that it withers down
many a lovely woman into an early grave. So is it the nature of woman to
hide from the world the pangs of wounded affection.

     Alas! I am done, you see no more of me;
     But I am sorry, yea, sorry with all my heart,
     That thus, you have willed it,--to be free:
     Shake hands forever, cancel all our vows,
     And when we meet at any time again,
     Be it not seen in either of our brows
     That we one jot of former love retain.

LIFE WITHOUT LOVE.

     Life without love is like day without sunshine,
       Roses bereft of sweet nature's perfume;
     Love is the guide mark to those who are weary
       Of waiting and watching in darkness and gloom.

     Love to the heart is like dewdrops to violets
       Left on the dust-ridden roadside to die;
     Love leads the way to our highest endeavors,
       Lightens and lessens the pain of each sigh.

     Life without love is like spring without flowers,
       Brook-streams that move not, or star-bereft sky;
     Love creates efforts most worthy and noble,
       Prompts us to live and resigns us to die.

     But the light of a whole life dies

FORGET THEE?

     Behold the sun forget to shine,
     The brightest star to twinkle,
     The ivy round the oak to twine,
     The tearful heart to sprinkle
     The sod that wraps affection's grave,
     The never silent surging sea
     The sandy shore to lash and lave--
     Then think that I'll forget thee.

THE MAIDEN IN LOVE.

     Sweet mother, I can spin no more to-day,

MORE THAN HIS SHARE.

"Martha, does thee love me?" asked a quaker youth of one at whose shrine
his heart's fondest feelings had been offered up.

"Why, Seth," answered she, "we are commanded to love one another, are we
not?"

"Aye, Martha; but does thee regard me with that feeling that the world
calls love?"

"I hardly know what to tell thee, Seth; I have greatly feared that my
heart was an erring one. I have tried to bestow my love on all; but I
have sometimes thought, perhaps, that thee was getting rather more than
thy share."

LOVE.

ONE WHO LOVES.

     I had so fixed my heart upon her,
     That whereso'er I fram'd a scheme of life
     For time to come, she was my only joy
     With which I used to sweeten future cares:
     I fancy'd pleasures, none but one who loves
     And doats as I did, can imagine like them.

THE TRAGEDY OF FICKLE LOVE.

     He came too late! Neglect had tried
       Her constancy too long;
     Her love had yielded to her pride
       And the deep sense of wrong.
     She scorned the offering of a heart
       Which lingered on its way,
     Till it could no delight impart,
       Nor spread one cheering ray.

     He came too late! At once he felt
       That all his power was o'er;
     Indifference in her calm smile dwelt--
       She thought of him no more.
     Anger and grief had passed away,
       Her heart and thoughts were free;
     She met him, and her words were gay
       No spell had memory.

     He came too late! Her countless dreams
       Of hope had long since flown;
     No charms dwelt in his chosen themes,
       Nor in his whispered tone.
     And when, with word and smile, he tried
       Affection still to prove,
     She nerved her heart with woman's pride
       And spurned his fickle love.

OH, NO! WE NEVER MENTION HIM.

     Oh, no! we never mention him, his name is never heard;
     My lips are now forbid to speak that once familiar word:
     From sport to sport they hurry me, to banish my regret;
     And when they win a smile from me, they think that I forget.

     They bid me seek in change of scene the charms that others see;
     But were I in a foreign land, they'd find no change in me.
     'Tis true that I behold no more the valley where we met,
     I do not see the hawthorn-tree; but how can I forget?

     For oh! there are so many things recall the past to me--
     The breeze upon the sunny hills, the billows of the sea;
     The rosy tint that decks the sky before the sun is set;--
     Ay, every leaf I look upon forbids me to forget.

     They tell me he is happy now, the gayest of the gay;
     They hint that he forgets me too,--but I heed not what they say:
     Perhaps like me he struggles with each feeling of regret;
     But if he loves as I have loved, he never can forget.

MARTIN LUTHER AND HIS FRIENDS.

"My dear Veit," said Luther, "I have said it often and I repeat it
again, whoever would know God aright and speculate concerning Him
without danger, must look into the manger, and learn first of all to
know the Son of the Virgin Mary, born at Bethlehem, lying in His
mother's bosom or hanging upon the cross; then will he understand who
God is. This will not only then be not terrible, but on the contrary
most attractive and comforting. Guard yourself, my dear Veit, from the
proud thought of climbing into heaven without this ladder, apart from
the Lord Jesus Christ in His humanity. As the Word simple describes Him,
stick to this, and do not permit reason to divert you from it; then will
you apprehend God aright! I wish to know of no other God than the God
who hung upon the cross, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and of the Virgin
Mary."


1193

Luther was remarkable for his contempt of riches, though few men had a
greater opportunity of obtaining them. The Elector of Saxony offered him
the produce of a mine at Sneberg, but he nobly refused it, lest it
should prove an injury to him.

LUXURY.

_Dr. Johnson_:--"A man gives half a guinea for a dish of green peas. How
much gardening does this occasion? How many laborers must the
competition, to have such things early in the market, keep in
employment? You will hear it said very gravely, 'Why was not the
half-guinea, thus spent in luxury, given to the poor? To how many might
it have afforded a good meal? Alas! has it not gone to the _industrious_
poor, whom it is better to support, than the _idle_ poor? You are much
surer that you are doing good when you _pay_ money to those who work, as
the recompense of their labor, than when you _give_ money merely in
charity."

A MAIDEN'S LAMENT.

     Full oft he sware with accents true and tender,
       "Though years roll by, my love shall ne'er wax old!"
     And so to him my heart I did surrender,
       Clear as a mirror of pure burnished gold;

     And from that day, unlike the seawood bending
       To every wave raised by the autumn gust,
     Firm stood my heart, on him alone depending,
       As the bold seaman in his ship doth trust.

     Is it some cruel evil one that hath bereft me?
       Or hath some mortal stolen away his heart?
     No word, no letter since the day he left me;
       Nor more he cometh, ne'er again to part!

     In vain I weep, in helpless, hopeless sorrow,
       From earliest morn until the close of day;
     In vain, till radiant dawn brings back the morrow,
       I sigh the weary, weary nights away.

     No need to tell how young I am, and slender--
       A little maid that in thy palm could lie:
     Still for some message comforting and tender
       I pace the room in sad expectancy.

AN OLD MAN OF ACUTE PHYSIOGNOMY.

An old man answering to the name of Joseph Wilmot, was brought before
the police court. His clothes looked as if they had been bought second
hand in his youthful prime.

"What business?"

     "None; I'm a traveler."

"A vagabond, perhaps?"

     "You are not far wrong: the difference between the two, is,
     that the latter travel without money, and the former without
     brains."

"Where have you traveled?"

     "All over the continent."

"For what purpose?"

     "Observation."

"What have you observed?"

     "A little to commend, much to censure, and very much to laugh
     at."

"Humph! What do you commend?"

     "A handsome women that will stay at home, an eloquent divine
     that will preach short sermons, a good writer that will not
     write too much, and a fool that has seen enough to hold his
     tongue."

"What do you censure?"

     "A man who marries a girl for fine clothing, a youth who
     studies law while he has the use of his hands, and the people
     who elect a drunkard to office."

"What do you laugh at?"

     "At a man who expects his position to command the respect
     which his personal qualities and qualifications do not merit."

He was dismissed.

Burns, the poet, when in Edinburgh one day, recognized an old farmer

that I spoke to, but the man that was in them."

MAN.

Man has been thrown naked into the world, feeble, incapable of flying
like the bird, running like the stag, or creeping like the serpent;
without means of defense, in the midst of terrible enemies armed with
claws and stings; without means to brave the inclemency of the seasons,
in the midst of animals protected by fleece, by scales, by furs; without
shelter, when all others have their den, their hole, their shell;
without arms, when all about him are armed against him. And yet he has
demanded of the lion his cave for a lodging and the lion retires before
his eyes; he has despoiled the bear of his skin, and of it made his
first clothing; he has plucked the horn from the bull, and this is his
first drinking-cup; then he has dug even into the bowels of the earth,
to seek there the instruments of his future strength; from a rib, a
sinew, and a reed, he has made arms; and the eagle, who, seeing him at
first in his weakness and nakedness, prepares to seize him as his prey,
struck in mid-air, falls dead at his feet, only to furnish a feather to
adorn his head. Among animals, is there one, who under such conditions
could have preserved life? Let us for a moment separate the workman from
his work, God from nature. Nature has done all for this insect,--of
which they had been discoursing,--nothing for man. It is that man should
be the product of intelligence rather than of matter; and God, in
granting him this celestial gift, this ray of light from the divine
fire, created him feeble and unprotected, that he might make use of it,
that he might be constrained to find in himself the elements of his
greatness.

         He was--describe him who can,
     An abridgement of all that was pleasant in man;
     A truer, nobler, trustier heart,
     More loving or more loyal, never beat

Some men remain poor because they haven't enough friends, and some

A poor man, though living in the crowded mart, no one will notice; a

Art may make a suit of clothes, but nature must produce the man.

Man is a social creature, and we are made to be helpful to each other;

Strive not too anxiously for thy support, thy Maker will provide. No

The difference, he, Johnson, observed between a well-bred and an
ill-bred man is this: One immediately attracts your liking, the other
your aversion. You love the one till you find reason to dislike him; you
dislike the other till you find reason to love him.

THE UNPUNCTUAL MAN.

He is a general disturber of other's peace and serenity. Everybody with
whom he has to do is thrown from time to time into a state of fever; he
is systematically late; regular only in his irregularity.

                                                 --_Smiles._

NO.

No is a surly, honest fellow, speaks his mind rough and round at once.

A true man never frets about his place in the world, but just slides
into it by the gravitation of his nature, and swings there as easily as
a star.

He had nothing and was content. He became rich and is discontented.

"HOW MUCH DID HE LEAVE?"

The question is asked concerning the property of every rich man who
dies; and it was answered very happily by Cloots, who was executor upon
the estate of the late Mr. Snodgrass. His neighbor, Mr. Nailroad, was an
exceedingly inquisitive man. The day after the funeral, Nailroad visited
Cloots, and, with an inspecting face, began to question him. "Mr.
Cloots," says he, "if it is not improper, will you inform me how much my
particular friend Snodgrass left?" "Certainly," said Cloots:--"He _left_
every cent he was worth in the world, and didn't take a copper with
him."

If a man write a better book, preach a better sermon, or make a better

MANNERS.

The distinguishing trait of people accustomed to good society is a calm,
imperturbable quiet, which pervades all their actions and habits, from
the greatest to the least. They eat in quiet, move in quiet, live in
quiet, and lose their wife, or even their money in quiet; while others
cannot take up either a spoon, or an affront, without making such an
amazing noise about it.

In society want of sense is not so unpardonable as want of manners.

1281

The wealthy and the noble when they expend large sums in decorating
their houses with the rare and costly efforts of genius, with busts, and
with cartoons from the pencil of a Raphael, are to be commended, if they
do not stand still _here_, but go on to bestow some pains and cost, that
the master himself be not inferior to the mansion, and that the owner be
not the only thing that is _little_, amidst everything else that is
_great_. The house may draw visitors, but it is the possessor alone that
can detain them.

Marriage is the bloom or blight of all men's happiness.

A MAIDEN'S TRUST IN MARRIAGE.

There is no one thing more lovely in this life, more full of the divine
courage, than when a young maiden, from her past life, from her happy
childhood, when she rambled over every field and moor around her home;
when a mother anticipated her wants and soothed her little cares, when
her brothers and sisters grew from merry playmates, to loving, trustful
friends; from Christmas gatherings and romps, the summer festivals in
bower or garden; from the secure backgrounds of her childhood, and
girlhood, and maidenhood, looks out into the dark and unilluminated
future away from all that, and yet unterrified, undaunted, leans her
fair cheek upon her lover's breast, and whispers--"Dear heart! I cannot
see, but I believe. The past was beautiful, but the future I can
trust--with thee!"

_Advice on Marriage._--An Athenian who was hesitating whether to give
his daughter in marriage to a man of worth with a small fortune, or to a
rich man who had no other recommendation, went to consult Themistocles
on the subject. "I would bestow my daughter," said Themistocles, "upon a
man without money, rather than upon money without a man."

     Cling closer, closer, life to life,
       Cling closer, heart to heart;
     The time will come, my own wed wife,
       When you and I must part!
     Let nothing break our band but Death,
       For in the world above
     'Tis the breaker Death that soldereth
       Our ring of wedded love.

A SUCCESSFUL EXPERIMENT.

A man of experience, declares that men, like plants, adapt themselves to
conditions. To illustrate his theory, he told of two men, one of whom
said to the other, at a pleasantly critical period:

"Do you think two can live as cheaply as one?"

"Before my marriage I thought they could," was the guarded reply.

"And afterward?" anxiously.

"Afterward I found they had to."

MARRIAGE,--CHOICE IN.

_Boswell_: "Pray, sir, do you not suppose that there are fifty women in
the world, with any one of whom a man may be as happy, as with any one
woman in particular?" _Johnson_: "Ay, sir, fifty thousand." _Boswell_:
"Then, sir, you are not of opinion with some who imagine that certain
men and certain women are made for each other, and that they cannot be
happy if they miss their counterparts." _Johnson_: "To be sure not, sir.
I believe marriages would in general be as happy, and often more so, if
they were all made by the Lord Chancellor, upon a due consideration of
the characters and circumstances, without the parties having any choice
in the matter."

     Wedlock, indeed, hath oft compared been

Marriage somewhat resembles a pair of shears, so joined that they cannot
be separated, often moving in opposite directions, yet always punishing
anyone who comes between them.

_Marry in your own Rank._ Wise was the man, ay, wise indeed, who first
weighed well this maxim, and with his tongue published it abroad, that

such as pride themselves in high-traced lineage.

THE NEWLY WEDDED.

     Now the rite is duly done,
     Now the word is spoken,
     And the spell has made us one
     Which may ne'er be broken;
     Rest we, dearest, in our home,
     Roam we o'er the heather;
     We shall rest, and we shall roam,
     Shall we not--together?

     From this hour the summer rose
     Sweeter breathes to charm us;
     From this hour the winter snows
     Lighter fall to harm us;
     Fair or foul--on land or sea--
     Come the wind or weather,
     Best or worst, whate'er they be,
     We shall (D.V.) always share--together!

is essential for the life to come, but good temper is the great
requisite for happiness in this world."

The reason why so few marriages are happy is because young ladies spend
their time in making nets, not in making cages.

COMPANIONSHIP IN MARRIAGE.

If God had designed woman as man's master, He would have taken her from
his head; if as his slave, He would have taken her from his feet; but as
He designed her for his companion and equal, He took her from his side.

when he sent her some flowers on the eve of her wedding day:--"I have
sent you a few flowers to adorn the dying moments of your single life."

     The treasures of the deep are not so precious
     As are the concealed comforts of a man
     Lock'd up in woman's love. I scent the air
     Of blessings, when I come but near the house.
     What a delicious breath marriage sends forth--
     The violet bed's not sweeter!

THE MARRIAGE VOW.

     Speak it not lightly; 'tis a holy thing--
       A bond, enduring thro' long distant years,
     Life will not prove all sunshine; there will come
       Dark hours for all; oh! will ye, when the night
     Of sorrow gathers thickly round your home,
       Love as ye did in days when smooth and bright
     Seemed the sure path ye trod, untouched by care,
       And deemed the future, like the present, fair?

     Age, with its silvery locks, will come stealing on,
       And bring the tottering step, the furrow'd cheek,
     The eye, from whence each lustrous gleam hath gone;
       And the pale lip, with accents low and weak;
     Will ye then think upon your youth's gay prime,
       And, smiling, bid love triumph over time?

     Speak it not lightly; oh! beware! beware!
       'Tis no vain promise, no unmeaning word;
     Before God's altar, now ye both do swear,
       And by the High and Holy One 'tis heard!
     Be faithful to each other till life's close;
       Seek peace below, and you'll get Heaven's repose.

_A Gentleman, but a Fool._--Chief Justice Marshall once found himself
suddenly brought to a halt by a small tree which intervened between the
front wheel and the body of his buggy. Seeing a servant at a short
distance, he asked him to bring an axe and cut down the tree. The
servant--a colored man--told the judge that there was no occasion for
cutting down the tree, but just to back the buggy. Pleased at the good
sense of the fellow, Judge Marshall told him that he would leave him
something at the inn hard by, where he intended to stop, having then no
small change. In due time the man applied, and a dollar was handed him.
Being asked if he knew who it was that gave him the dollar, he replied:
"No, sir: I concluded he was a gentleman by his leaving the money, but I
think he is the biggest fool I ever saw."

_Numbers, xxxvi. 6_,--"Let them marry to whom they think best; only to
the family of the tribe of their fathers shall they marry."

Mr. John Martin used to give two advices, both to his children and
others, in reference to marriages. One was, "Keep within the bounds of
your profession." The other was, "Look at suitableness in age, quality,
education, temper, etc." He used to observe, from Genesis, ii, 18, "I
will make him a help-meet for him;" that there is not meetness, there
will not be much help. He commonly said to his children, with reference
to their choice in marriage, "Please God, and please yourselves, and you
shall never displease me;" and greatly blamed those parents who conclude
matches for their children without their consent. He sometimes mentioned
the saying of a pious gentlewoman, who had many daughters.--"The care of
most people is how to get good husbands for their daughters; but my care
is to fit my daughters to be good wives, and then let God provide for
them."


1311

MATRIMONY.

     The sum of all that makes a just man happy
     Consists in the well-choosing of his wife:
     And there, well to discharge it, does require
     Equality of years, of birth, of fortune;
     For beauty being poor, and not cried up
     By birth or wealth, can truly mix with neither.
     And wealth, when there's such difference in years,
     And fair descent, must make the yoke uneasy.

FROM A WORK ENTITLED "SKETCHES OF PERSIA."

The following admirable lines were inscribed upon a golden crown having
five sides, which was found in the tomb of Noosherwan.

     _First Side._--"Consider the end before you begin, and before
     you advance, provide a retreat.

          Give not unnecessary pain to any man, but study the
          happiness of all.

          Ground not your dignity upon your power to hurt
          others."

     _Second Side._--"Take counsel before you commence any measure,
     and never trust its execution to the inexperienced.

          Sacrifice your property for your life, and your life
          for your religion.

          Spend your time in establishing a good name, and if
          you desire fortune, learn contentment."

     _Third Side._--"Grieve not for that which is broken, stolen,
     burnt or lost.

          Never give order in another man's house; accustom
          yourself to eat your bread at your own table."

     _Fourth Side._--"Take not a wife from a bad family, and seat
     not thyself with those who have no shame.

          Keep thyself at a distance from those who are
          incorrigible in bad habits, and hold no intercourse
          with that man who is insensible to kindness.

          Convert not the goods of others.

          Be sensible of your own value, estimate justly the
          worth of others: and war not with those who are far
          above thee in fortune."

     _Fifth Side._--"Be envious of no man, and avoid being out of
     temper, or thy life will pass in misery.

          Respect and protect the females of thy family."

relief, but that it sunk them much deeper in misery. He observed, that
laboring men who work hard and live sparingly, are seldom or never
troubled with low spirits.

_The Greatest Men Arose from the People._--The greatest scholars, poets,
orators, philosophers, warriors, statesmen, inventors, and improvers of
the arts, arose from the people. If we had waited till courtiers had
invented the arts of printing, clockmaking, navigation, and a thousand
others, we should probably have continued in darkness till this hour.

     I would as soon attempt to entice a star

ABBOTSFORD.

When Washington Irving visited Abbotsford, Sir Walter Scott introduced
him to many of his friends and favorites, not only among the neighboring
farmers, but the laboring peasantry. "I wish to show you," said Scott,
"some of our really excellent plain Scotch people. The character of a
nation is not to be learnt from its fine folks, its fine gentlemen and
ladies; such you meet everywhere, and they are everywhere the same."

MEN--UNLUCKY.

Never have anything to do with an unlucky man. I never act with them.
Their advice sounds very well, but they cannot get on themselves; and if
they cannot do good to themselves, how can they do good to me?

YOUNG MEN.

The trouble with most young men is that they do not learn anything
thoroughly, and are apt to do the work committed to them in a careless
manner. The business world is full of such young men, content in simply
putting in their time somehow and drawing their salaries, making no
effort whatever to increase their efficiency and thereby enhance their
own as well as their employers' interests.

_The Clemency of a Queen._--It is related that during the first few days
of the reign of Queen Victoria, then a girl between nineteen and twenty
years of age, some sentences of a court-martial were presented for her
signature. One was death for desertion. She read it, paused, and looked
up to the officer who laid it before her, and said:--"Have you nothing
to say in behalf of this man?" "Nothing; he has deserted three times,"
answered the officer. "Think again, Your Grace," was the reply. "And,"
said the gallant veteran, as he related the circumstance to his
friends--(for he was none other than the Duke of Wellington)--"seeing
her majesty so earnest about it, I said--'He is certainly a bad
_soldier_, but there was somebody who spoke as to his good character,
and he may be a good _man_ for aught I know to the contrary.'" "Oh, I
thank you a thousand times!" exclaimed the youthful queen, and hastily
writing 'Pardoned' in large letters on the fatal page, she sent it
across the table with a hand trembling with eagerness and beautiful
emotion.

MAN--THE CHILD OF MERCY.

     When the Omniscient Giver of all life,
     In His eternal council first conceived
     The thought of man's creation, forth He call'd
     Into His presence three bright ministers--
     Justice, and Truth, and Mercy, that forever
     Had hovered around His throne--and thus He spoke;
     "Shall we make man?" Then stern Justice replied:
     "Create him not, for he will trample on
     Thy holy law;" and Truth, too, answering, said,
     "Create him not, O God! he will pollute
     Thy sanctuary!" When forth Mercy came,
     And dropping on her knees, exclaimed: "O God!
     Create him! I will watch his wandering steps,
     And tender guide thro' all the darksome paths
     That he may tread." Then forthwith God made man,
     And said: "Thou art the child of Mercy; go:
     In mercy with thy erring brother deal."

MERCY.

                             Think not the good,
     The gentle deeds of mercy thou hast done,
     Shall die forgotten all; the poor, the prisoner,
     The fatherless, the friendless, and the widow,
     Who daily owe the bounty of thy hand,
     Shall cry to Heaven, and pull a blessing on thee.

                                          --_Nicholas Rowe._


1335

He that showeth mercy when it may be best spared will receive mercy when
it shall be most needed.

MERCY.

     I would not enter on my list of friends
     (Though graced with polished manners and fine sense,
     Yet wanting sensibility) the man
     Who needlessly sets foot upon a worm.
     An inadvertent step may crush the snail
     That crawls at evening in the public path;
     But he that has humanity forewarn'd,
     Will tread aside, and let the reptile live.
     Ye, who love mercy, teach your sons
     To love it too.

FRIENDS IN NEED.

Perhaps one of the most noteworthy characteristics of Methodists is the
spirit of clannishness which runs through the whole body. Is any sick,
the rest are eager to pray; is any merry, the rest are delighted to sing
psalms; and they will not only pray and sing in sympathy, which is
comparatively easy, but they are ready to spend, and to be spent, for
the brethren to almost any extent. Men may know that they are Methodists
from the love they have one to another.

     Through whatsoever ill betide
       For you I will be spent and spend:
     I'll stand forever by your side,
     And naught shall you and me divide,
       Because you are my friend.

                              --_Ellen Thorneycroft Fowler._

It is indicative of a weak mind to be much depressed by adversity or
elated by prosperity.

Overtasking the mind is an unwise act; when nature is unwilling, the
labour is vain.

1349

     Who fills his mind with matters small
     For great things has no room at all.

When the mind is in a state of uncertainty, the smallest impulse directs
it to either side.

1351

MIND.

It cannot be too deeply impressed on the mind, that application is the
price to be paid for mental acquisitions, and that it is as absurd to
expect them without it, as to hope for a harvest where we have not sown
the seed.

                                                 --_Bailey._


1352

Narrowness of mind is often the cause of obstinacy: we do not easily
believe beyond what we see.

1353

                                         I am one,
     Who finds within me a nobility,
     That spurns the idle pratings of the great,
     And their mean boast of what their fathers were,
     While they themselves are fools effeminate,
     The scorn of all who know the worth of mind
     And virtue.

All who know their mind do not know their heart.

RESIGNATION.

     Entire and perfect happiness is never
     Vouchsafed to man; but nobler minds endeavor
     To keep their inward sorrows unrevealed.
     With meaner spirits nothing is concealed.
     Weak, and unable to conform to fortune,
     With rude rejoicing or complaint importune,
     They vent their exultation or distress.
     Whate'er betides us--grief or happiness--
     The brave and wise will bear with steady mind,
     The allotment, unforeseen and undefined,
     Of good or evil, which the Gods bestow,
     Promiscuously dealt to man below.

                                        --_Theognis, Greek._

1356

Life will always be, to a large extent, what we ourselves make it. Each
mind makes its own little world. The cheerful mind makes it pleasant,
and the discontented mind makes it miserable. "My mind to me a kingdom
is" applies alike to the peasant as to the monarch.


1357

The face is the index of the mind.

It is not position, but mind, that I want, said a lady to her father,

1359

Those who visit foreign countries, but who associate only with their own
countrymen, change their climate, but not their customs; they see new
meridians, but the same men, and with heads as empty as their pockets,
return home, with travelled bodies, but untravelled minds.


1360

Youthful minds, like the pliant wax, are susceptible of the most lasting
impressions, and the good or evil bias they then receive is seldom if
ever eradicated.


1361

Little minds are hurt by little things; great minds rise above them.


1362

Noblest minds are easiest bent.

DUTY OF MINISTERS.

My friends, the chief duty of the ministers of God, is, that they should
help their brethren to the best of their fallible knowledge and feeble
power. When there is a spirit of repentance; when men truly seek the
means of grace; when they have ceased to be insolent and defiant in sin;
when they do intend--were it but ever so faintly--to lead a new
life--then

     Our commission is to heal, not harm;
     We come not to condemn, but reconcile;
     We come not to compel, but call again;
     We come not to destroy, but edify;
     Nor yet to question things already done;
     These are forgiven; matters of the past;
     And range with jetsam, and with offal, thrown
     Into the blind sea of forgetfulness.

                                     --_F. W. Farrar, D. D._

Most just it is that he who breweth mischief should have the first
draught of it himself.

CONSTANTINE AND THE MISER.

Constantine the Great, born 274 A. D., in order to reclaim a miser, took
a lance and marked out a space of ground the size of a human body and
said to him: "Add heap to heap, accumulate riches upon riches, extend
the bounds of your possessions, conquer the whole world, and in a few
days, such a spot as this, will be all that you will have."


1368

A miser grows rich by seeming poor; an extravagant man grows poor by
seeming rich.

1369

_Misers._--If I knew a miser, who gave up every kind of comfortable
living, all the pleasure of doing good to others, all the esteem of his
fellow citizens, for the sake of accumulating wealth; "Poor Man," I
would say, "you pay too much for your whistle."

MODERATION.

     He that holds fast the golden mean,

     Nor plagues that haunt the rich man's door.

The abundance of money ruins youth.


1383

I almost grow to believe there is a sort of curse on money which is not
earned, even when it is bestowed by father on son or daughter. It
cripples individual development, and I think only when it is earned is
it blest.

THE POWER OF MONEY.

     Money will purchase occupation;
     It will purchase all the conveniences of life;
     It will purchase variety of company;
     It will purchase all sorts of entertainments;
     It can change men's manners; alter their conditions!
     How tempestuous these slaves are without it!
     O thou powerful metal! what authority
     Is in thee! thou art the key of all men's
     Mouths; with thee a man may lock up the jaws
     Of an informer, and without thee, he
     Cannot open the lips of a lawyer.

WHILE MOTHER WAS AWAY.

The Princess of Wales has trained her children so carefully in habits of
obedience and veracity that they are most trustworthy little persons.
Before her royal highness started on her trip round the world with her
husband, she drew up a list of rules to be observed in the nursery, and
added a series of light tasks to be fullfilled by each one of the
youngsters before the date set for her return.

The rules were to be enforced by the nurses. The performance of the
tasks was left to the honor of the children, and in addition there was a
list of things they must not do.

There were occasional lapses of memory as regards the forbidden things,
and some carelessness in carrying out the tasks, for royal children,
despite the severity of their training, are children still. But in the
main they respected their mother's wishes and commands, and took no
advantage of her absence. Upon one occasion, however, they were sorely
tempted. This was when their loving and beloved grandmother, Queen
Alexandria, brought them a big box of bonbons. But when the sweets were
offered to them, one child after another reluctantly but firmly declined
to take any.

"We like them, but mother has forbidden us to eat them," explained the
eldest prince.

"You can have the sugar-plums if I say you may," said the indulgent
queen. "I will tell mama all about it when she returns."

Prince Eddie wavered momentarily, then reiterated his refusal.

"We'd like them," he sighed, "but that's what mother said."

The queen was slightly annoyed by this opposition.

"But if I say you may--" she said.

Prince Eddie stood his ground, a hero between two fires--the wishes of
his adored mother, and those of his almost equally adored grandmother.
His sister and his brothers followed his lead. When the queen went away
she put the bonbons on the nursery table and there they stayed for
months untouched, a handsome monument to the thoroughness of the
princess' training and the respectful love and devotion of her children.

THE DARING OF A MOTHER.

In Scotland a peasant woman had a child a few weeks old, which was
seized by one of the golden eagles, the largest in the country, and
borne away in its talons to its lofty eyrie on one of the most
inaccessible cliffs of Scotland's bleak hills; the mother, perceiving
her loss, hurried in alarm to its rescue, and the peasantry among whom
the alarm spread, rushed out to her aid; they all came to the foot of
the tremendous precipice; the peasants were anxious to risk their lives
in order to recover the little infant; but how was the crag to be
reached? One peasant tried to climb, but was obliged to return; another
tried and came down injured; a third tried, and one after another
failed, till a universal feeling of despair and deep sorrow fell upon
the crowd as they gazed upon the eyrie where the infant lay. At last a
woman was seen, climbing first one part and then another, getting over
one rock and then another, and while every heart trembled with alarm, to
the amazement of all, they saw her reach the loftiest crag, and clasp
the infant rejoicingly in her bosom. This heroic female began to descend
the perilous steep with her child; moving from point to point; and while
everyone thought that her next step would precipitate her and dash her
to pieces, they saw her at length reach the ground with the child safe
in her arms. Who was this female? Why did she succeed when others
failed? It was The Mother of The Child.

FUNERAL OF A MOTHER.

The Rev. George Crabbe when describing the funeral of "The Mother," in
his passing glance at the half-interested spectators, says:--

     Curious and sad, upon the fresh-dug hill
     The village lads stood, melancholy still.

and in his description of the return to the house:--

     Arrived at home, how then they gazed around.
     In every place where she no more was found;
     The seat at table she was wont to fill;
     The fireside chair, still set, but vacant still;
     The garden walks, a labor all her own;
     The latticed bower, with trailing shrubs o'ergrown:
     The Sunday pew she filled with all her race--
     Each place of hers, was now a sacred place,
     That while it called up sorrows in the eyes,
     Pierced the full heart, and forced them still to rise.

A MOTHER'S LOVE.

Children, look in those eyes, listen to that dear voice, notice the
feeling of even a single touch that is bestowed upon you by that gentle
hand. Make much of it while yet you have that most precious of all good
gifts, a loving mother. Read the unfathomable love of those eyes; the
kind anxiety of that tone and look, however slight your pain.

In after-life you may have friends, fond, dear, kind friends; but never
will you have again the inexpressible love and gentleness lavished upon
you which none but a mother bestows. Often do I sigh in my struggles
with hard, uncaring world, for the sweet, deep security I felt when, of
an evening nestling in her bosom, I listened to some quiet tale,
suitable to my age, read in her tender and untiring voice. Never can I
forget her sweet glances cast upon me when I appeared asleep, never her
kiss of peace at night. Years have passed away since we laid her beside
my father in the old church yard; yet still her voice whispers from the
grave, and her eye watches over me, as I visit spots long since hallowed
to the memory of my mother.

     And would some pretty story tell,
     Or kiss the place to make it well?
         My mother.

Each mother is a historian; she writes not the history of empires or of
nations on paper, but she writes her own history on the imperishable
mind of her child. That tablet and that history will remain indelible
when time shall be no more. That history each mother shall meet again,
and read, with eternal joy, or unutterable grief, in the coming ages of
eternity.

MOTHERS AND MEN.

That it is the mother who moulds the man is a sentiment beautifully
illustrated by the following recorded observation of a shrewd writer:--

"When I lived among the Choctaw Indians, I held a consultation with one
of their chiefs respecting the successive stages of their progress in
the arts of civilized life; and among other things he informed me, that
at their start they made a great mistake,--they only sent boys to
school. These boys came home intelligent men; but they married
uneducated and uncivilized wives, and the uniform result was, the
children were all like their mothers. The father soon lost all his
interest both in wife and children. 'And now,' said he 'if we would
educate but one class of our children, we should choose the girls; for,
when they become mothers, they educate their sons.'"


1409

MOTHER.

     Can'st thou, mother, for a moment think
       That we, thy children, when old age shall shed
       Its blanching honors on thy weary head,
     Could from our best of duties ever shrink?
     Sooner the sun from his high sphere should sink,
       Than we, ungrateful, leave thee in that day
       To pine in solitude thy life away,
     Or shun thee, tottering on the grave's cold brink.
     Banish the thought!--where'er our steps may roam,
       O'er smiling plains, or wastes without a tree
       Still will fond memory point our hearts to thee,
     And paint the pleasures of thy peaceful home;
       While duty bids us all thy griefs assuage
       And smoothe the pillow of thy sinking age.

MY MOTHER.

     My mother! when I learned that thou wast dead,
     Say, wast thou conscious of the tears I shed?
     I heard the bells tolled on thy burial day,
     I saw the hearse that bore thee slow away;
     And, turning from my nursery window, drew
     A long, long sigh, and wept a last adieu!
     Thus many a sad to-morrow came and went,
     Till, all my stock of infant sorrow spent,
     I learned at last submission to my lot:
     But though I less deplored thee, ne'er forgot.

A MOTHER'S EXAMPLE.

It was a judicious resolution of a father, as well as a most pleasing
compliment to his wife, when, on being asked by a friend what he
intended to do with his girls, he replied: "I intend to apprentice them
to their mother, that they may learn the art of improving time, and be
fitted to become wives, mothers, heads of families, and useful members
of society." Equally just, but very different, was the remark of an
unhappy husband--his wife was vain and thoughtless--"It is hard to say,
but if my girls are to have a chance of growing up good for anything,
they must be sent out of the way of their mother's example."

A MOTHER'S SORROWS.

     My son! my son! I cannot speak the rest--
     Ye who have sons can only know my fondness!
     Ye who have lost them, or who fear to lose,
     Can only know my pangs! none else can guess them;
     A mother's sorrows cannot be conceived
     But by a mother!


1414

Pomponius Atticus, who pronounced a funeral oration on the death of his
mother, protested that though he had resided with her sixty-seven years,
he was never once reconciled to her; "because," said he, "there never
happened the least discord between us, and consequently there was no
need of reconciliation."

THE MOTHER'S HOPE.

     Is there, when the winds are singing
       In the happy summer time--
     When the raptured air is ringing
     With earth's music heavenward springing,
       Forest chirp and village chime--
     Is there, of the sounds that float
     Unsighingly, a single note
     Half so sweet, and clear, and wild,
     As the laughter of a child?

TURF FROM MY MOTHER'S GRAVE.

The following simple, beautiful lines contain an unadorned statement of
a fact in the experience of a friend, who is fond of wandering in the
Scotch highland glens:

      As I came wandering down Glen Spean,
        Where the braes are green and grassy,
      With my light step I overtook
        A weary-footed lassie.

      She had one bundle on her back,
        Another in her hand,
      And she walked as one who was full loath
        To travel from the land.

      Quoth I, "my bonnie lass!"--for she
        Had hair of flowing gold,
      And dark brown eyes, and dainty limbs,
        Right pleasant to behold--

     "My bonnie lass, what aileth thee,
        On this bright summer day,
      To travel sad and shoeless thus
        Upon the stony way?

     "I'm fresh and strong, and stoutly shod,
        And thou art burdened so;
      March lightly now and let me bear
        The bundles as we go."

     "No, no!" she said, "that canna be,
        What's mine is mine to bear,
      Of good or ill, as God may will,
        I take my portioned share."

     "But you have two and I have none;
        One burden give to me;
      I'll take _that_ bundle from thy back
        That heavier seems to be."

     "No, no!" she said; "_this_, if you will,
        _That_ holds--no hand but mine
      May bear its weight from dear Glen Spean
        'Cross the Atlantic brine!"

     "Well, well! but tell me what may be
        Within that precious load
      Which thou dost bear with such fine care
        Along the dusty road?

     "Is it some present rare
        From friend in parting hour;
      Perhaps, as prudent maidens wont,
        Thou tak'st with thee thy dower?"

      She drooped her head, and with her hand
        She gave a mournful wave;
     "Oh, do not jest, dear sir--it is
        Turf from my mother's grave!"

      I spoke no word; we sat and wept
        By the road-side together:
      No purer dew on that bright day
        Was dropt upon the heather.

     When we are sick, where can we turn for succor,
       When we are wretched where can we complain?
       And when the world looks cold and surly on us
     Where can we go to meet a warmer eye
     With such sure confidence as to a mother?

     There is a pleasure in the pathless woods,

     I love not man the less, but nature more,
     From these our interviews, in which I steal
     From all I may be, or have been before,
     To mingle with the universe, and feel
     What I am can ne'er express, yet cannot all conceal.

said, were he to select one word as the most important in education, it
should be the word, obey. My experience since has fully convinced me of
the justice of the remark. Without filial obedience everything must go
wrong. Is not a disobedient child guilty of a manifest breach of the
Fifth Commandment? And is not a parent, who suffers this disobedience to
continue, an habitual partaker in his child's offense against that
commandment?"

Obstinacy is will asserting itself without being able to justify itself.
It is persistence without a plausible motive. It is the tenacity of

SELF-CONFIDENCE.

Men often lose opportunities by want of self-confidence. Doubts and
fears in the minds of some rise up over every event, and they fear to
attempt what most probably would be successful through their
timorousness; while a courageous, active man, will, perhaps with half
the ability, carry an enterprise to a prosperous termination.

Men spend their lives in anticipations, in determining to be vastly
happy at some period or other, when they have time. But the present time

are gone; the future may never come to us.

OPPORTUNITY.

     Master of human destinies am I;
     Fame, love, and fortune on my footsteps wait,
     Cities and fields I walk; I penetrate
     Deserts, and seas remote, and, passing by
     Hovel, and mart, and palace, soon or late,
     I knock unbidden once at every gate.
     If sleeping, wake; if feasting, rise
     Before I turn away. It is the hour of fate,
     And those who follow me, gain every state
     Mortals desire, and conquer every foe
     Save Death, but those who doubt, or hesitate,
     Condemned to failure, penury, and woe,
     Seek me in vain, and uselessly implore.
     I answer not, and I return no more.

_Didn't Know the Place._--A young man who left his native city to study
medicine in Paris, and had been applying his time and the paternal
remittances to very different purposes, received a visit from his
father, who intended making a short stay in the capital to inspect its
wonders. During an afternoon stroll together, the day after the elder's
arrival, the father and son happened to pass in front of a large
colonnaded building. "What is that?" said the senior, carelessly. "I
don't know, but we'll inquire," answered the student. On the query being
put to an official, he shortly replied: "That? It is the School of
Medicine."

Ambitious parents sometimes try to make lawyers, doctors, preachers and

circumstances to do another.

The cavalry captain Kurtzhagen was invited to dine with King Frederick
II. "From what noble house are you descended?" asked the king. "From
none whatever," replied Kurtzhagen. "My parents are only poor country
people, but I would not exchange them for any other parents in the
world." "Well said," replied the king. "Woe to him who is so mean as to
be ashamed of his parents."

PARTING.

     We twain have met like the ships upon the sea,
     Who hold an hour's converse, so short, so sweet;
     One little hour! and then, away they speed
     On lonely paths, through mists, and cloud, and foam,
     To meet no more.

       When from those friends we sever,
     Perhaps to part for months--for years--
       Perhaps to part for ever.

     Remember, three things come not back;

     It will not swerve, it will not stay
     Its speed; it flies to wound or slay;
     The spoken word, so soon forgot
     By thee, but it has perished not;
     In other hearts 'tis living still,
     And doing work for good or ill;
     And the lost opportunity
     That cometh back no more to thee.
     In vain thou weep'st, in vain dost yearn,
     These three will never more return.

'Fire!' The whole village will run to help you, for everybody will be
afraid the fire will spread."

SCOTTISH PERSEVERANCE.

Scottish perseverance has itself become proverbial; we remember to have
met with a story which is said to be connected with the foundation of an
opulent mercantile house which has flourished for some generations.
Saunders, the traveler, entered a shop in London and enquired for the
head of the house; one of the clerks asked what he wanted; the answer of
Saunders was, as usual, a question, "Want ye aught in my line, sir?"
"No," was the prompt reply, accompanied by a look of contempt at the
itinerant Scotch merchant. "Will ye no tak' a look o' the gudes, sir?"
was Saunders' next query. "No, not at all; I have not time. Take them
away--take them away!" "Ye'll aiblins (perhaps) find them worth your
while, and I doubt na but ye'll buy," said Saunders; and he proceeded to
untie and unstrap his burden. "Go away--go away!" was reiterated more
than once by the clerk, but the persevering Scot still persisted. The
master of the establishment overheard all that had taken place, and now
he stepped forward, and, moved by some compunction for the treatment the
traveler had received, and some admiration, too, for the patience and
perseverance of the man, he consented to look over the contents of the
pack, found them to be exactly the goods he was in want of, purchased
them all, and gave a very large order; and thus, says Chambers, who
tells the story, assisted in the foundation of a large mercantile house.

But is not this the stuff of which also the Livingstones and the
Macleods are made? Was not this the spirit which set the brave Sir
Walter Scott to work, when sinking into his later years, to overtake his
fearful loss of one hundred thousand pounds? Is it not a commentary upon
that especial proverb which we have said so illustrates the Scottish
character, "He that tholes (or endures) overcomes?"

THE FATE OF PETITIONS.

Jenny Lind was frequently known to pass unobserved from her residence,
as if to make a visit, and had been traced to the back lanes and
cottages of the poor, whose wants she ascertained and relieved. Several
times she had been remonstrated with, and warned by her intimate friends
against being imposed upon. She always replied, "Never mind; if I
relieve ten, and one is worthy, I am satisfied."

NAME OF THE GOOD SAMARITAN.

A philanthropist, when a candidate for the ministry, was traveling on
one occasion from Strasbourg. It was in the winter time. The ground was
deeply covered with snow, and the roads were almost impassable. He had
reached the middle of his journey and was among the mountains; and by
that time was so exhausted that he could stand erect no longer. He was
rapidly freezing to death, and sleep began to overpower him. He
commended himself to God, and yielded to what he felt to be the sleep of
death. He knew not how long he slept, but suddenly became conscious of
some one rousing him. Before him stood a wagon-driver in his blue
blouse, and the wagon not far away. His rescuer gave him a little wine
and food, and the spirit of life returned. He then helped him upon the
wagon, and brought him to the next village. Oberlin, the philanthropist,
was profuse in his thanks, and offered money, which his benefactor
refused. "It is only a duty to help one another," said the wagoner; "and
it is the next thing to an insult to offer a reward for such a service."
"Then," said Oberlin, "at least tell me your name, that I may have you
in thankful remembrance before God." "I see," said the wagoner, "that
you are a minister of the Gospel. Please tell me the name of the Good
Samaritan." "That," said Oberlin, "I cannot do; for it was not put on
record." "Then," replied the wagoner, "until you can tell me his name,
permit me to withhold mine."

_A Sensible Answer._--A story is told about Wendell Phillips--a story
that must have made even the serious-minded Abolitionist laugh heartily:
He was in a hotel in Charleston, had breakfast in his room, and was
served by a slave. Mr. Phillips spoke to him as an Abolitionist, but the
waiter seemed to be more concerned about the breakfast than about
himself. Finally Mr. Phillips told him to go away, saying that he could
not bear to be waited upon by a slave.

The other remonstrated: "Scuse me, massa, but I's obliged to stay yere,
'cause I's 'sponsible fo' de silverware."

THE BREVITY OF PLEASURES.

A BUDDING CHESTERFIELD.

A small boy was at a table where his mother was not near to take care of
him, and a lady next to him volunteered her services. "Let me cut your
steak for you," she said; "if I can cut it the way you like it," she
added, with some degree of doubt. "Thank you," the boy responded,
accepting her courtesy; "I shall like it the way you cut it, even if you
do not cut it the way I like it."

TRUE POLITENESS.

The following beautiful incident is related of the late Prince consort.
On one occasion a humble but very worthy man who had befriended the
Prince in early life called to see him, and was invited to come to the
family table. He began to eat with his knife, as he had always been
accustomed to do, and this excited a little quiet merriment among the
young people. Prince Albert looked round upon them, as if to say, "Stop
that!" and at once began himself to eat with his knife, and continued to
do so to the end of the meal. After dinner, one of the children asked
him why he did so. The Prince replied: "It is well enough for us to
observe the etiquette of the day; but it is far more important to avoid
insulting people. I wanted my old friend to enjoy his dinner, which he
could not have done had he seen you laughing at him. He is accustomed to
use his knife, and it would doubtless be quite difficult for him to use
the fork instead."--This was genuine politeness, and the world would be
happier if the same feeling were always shown.

it smoothes wrinkles.

THE COMPLAINTS OF THE POOR.

     "And wherefore do the poor complain?"
       The rich man ask'd of me:
     "Come, walk abroad with me," I said,
       "And I will answer thee."

     'Twas evening, and the frozen streets
       Were cheerless to behold;
     And we were wrapp'd and coated well,
       And yet we were a-cold.

     We met an old, bareheaded man,
       His locks were thin and white;
     I ask'd him what he did abroad
       In that cold winter's night.

     The cold was keen, indeed, he said--
       But at home no fire had he;
     And therefore he had come abroad
       To ask for charity.

     We met a young barefooted child,
       And she begged loud and bold;
     I asked her what she did abroad
       When the wind it blew so cold.

     She said her father was at home,
       And he lay sick abed;
     And therefore was it she was sent
       Abroad to beg for bread.

     We saw a woman sitting down
       Upon a stone to rest;
     She had a baby at her back,
       And another at her breast.

     I ask'd her why she loiter'd there,
       When the night-wind was so chill;
     She turn'd her head, and bade the child
       That scream'd behind, be still--

     Then told us that her husband served,
       A soldier, far away;
     And therefore to her parish she
       Was begging back her way.

     I turn'd me to the rich man then,
       For silently stood he;
     "You ask'd me why the poor complain
       And these have answer'd thee!"

ONE "ALWAYS RIGHT;" THE OTHER, "NEVER WRONG."

A worthy old Ayrshire farmer had the portraits of himself and his wife
painted. When that of her husband, in an elegant frame, was hung over
the fireplace, the gudewife remarked in a sly manner: "I think, gudeman,
noo that ye've gotten your picture hung up there, we should just put in
below't, for a motto, like, 'Aye richt!'"

"Deed may ye, my woman," replied her husband in an equally pawkie tone;
"and when ye get yours hung up over the sofa there, we'll just put up
anither motto on't, and say, 'Never wrang.'"

CONCEALING POVERTY.

If rich, it is easy enough to conceal our wealth; but, if poor, it is
not quite so easy to conceal our poverty. We shall find it less
difficult to hide a thousand guineas, than one hole in our coat.

PRAISE.

     How could my tongue
     Take pleasure, and be lavish in thy praise!
     How could I speak thy nobleness of nature!

     And inborn truth, unknowing to dissemble!

DIRECTED IN A DREAM.

A zealous divine, who had prayed earnestly that God would teach him the
perfect way of truth, was directed in a dream to go to a certain place,
where he would find an instructor; when he came to the place, he found a
man in ordinary attire, to whom he wished a good morning.

"I never had a bad morning," replied the man. "That is very singular; I
wish you may always be as fortunate." "I was never unfortunate," said
he. "I hope you may always be as happy," said the divine. "I am never
unhappy," said the other. "I wish," said the divine, "that you would
explain yourself a little."

"That I will cheerfully do," said the other; "I said that I never had a
bad morning, for every morning, even if I am pinched with hunger, I
praise God. If it rains, or snows, or hails, whether the day is serene
or tempestuous, I am still thankful to God, and therefore I never had a
joyless morning. If I am miserable in outward circumstances, and
despised, I still praise God; you wished that I might always be
fortunate, but I cannot be unfortunate, because nothing befalls me but
according to the will of God, and I believe that His will is always
good, in whatever He does or permits to be done. You wished me always
happy, but I cannot be unhappy, because my will is always resigned to
the will of God."

The divine, astonished at the man's answers, asked him whence he came.

"I came from God," he replied. "Where did you find Him?" "Where I left
the world." "Where did you leave God?" "With the pure in heart." "What
are you?" "I am a king." "Where is your kingdom?" "It is within my
bosom. I have learned to rule my appetites and passions, and that is
better than to rule any kingdom in the world."

"How were you brought into this happy condition?"

"By secret prayer, spiritual meditation and union with God; nothing
below God could satisfy my desires; I have found Him, and in Him I have
found Peace and Rest."

A PRAYER "FOR ABSENT RELATIVES AND FRIENDS."

     "Our Father, in Thy mercy
     Hear our anxious prayer:
     Keep our loved ones now far absent
                         'Neath Thy care."

NO ROOF ON THE HOUSE.

A laborer went to work for a wealthy farmer. It was regarded as
something of a favor to be employed by him, as he was a prompt and
liberal paymaster, and was look'd upon by his neighbors as a very
superior farmer. The man remained with him only a few days.

"I'm told you've left farmer P," said a neighbor.

"Yes, I have," was the reply.

"Was the work too hard for you?"

"There was nothing to complain of on that score."

"What then? Were the wages too low?"

"No."

"Why did you leave?"

"There was no roof on the house!" And he went on his way, leaving the
questioner to ponder on the strange answer he had given.

The man's meaning may be found in the saying of an old writer, who
affirms that a dwelling in which prayer is not offered up to God daily,
is like a house without a roof, in which there cannot be either peace,
safety, or comfort.

A QUAINT OLD PRAYER.

     "Oh, that mine eyes might closed be
     To what concerns me not to see;
     That deafness might possess mine ear
     To what concerns me not to hear;
     That love my tongue might always tie
     From ever speaking foolishly!
     But what are wishes! Lord, mine eye
     On Thee is fixed. To Thee I cry.
     Wash, Lord, and purify my heart
     And make it clean in every part;
     And when 'tis clean, Lord, keep it, too,
     For that is more than I can do."

_Rev. Thomas Guthrie_:--"As an ambassador for Christ, I regard a
preacher of the Gospel as filling the most responsible office any mortal
can occupy. His pulpit is, in my eyes, loftier than a throne; and of all
professions, learned or unlearned, his, though usually in point of
wealth the poorest, I esteem the most honorable. That office is one
angels themselves might covet."

YESTERDAY, TO-DAY AND TO-MORROW.

     We cannot change yesterday--that is clear,--

FULFILMENT OF A PROPHESY.

The minuteness and accuracy of God's program of the ages is often
overlooked. There is a singular and striking instance of this in the
triumphal entry of our Lord into Jerusalem. [1592:A]The command to go
into the village nearby and bring the colt that would be found tied
there, was in fulfillment of a prophesy made five hundred years before
by Zachariah, 9th chapter, 9th verse:--"Rejoice greatly, O daughter of
Zion: shout O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee:
He is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and
upon a colt the foal of an ass."--That same donkey colt was so essential
to the transaction of that day, that the pageant could not have gone on
without it.

PUNCTUALITY AS A VIRTUE.

It is neither polite nor honest to be behind hand when one can just as
easily be on time. An artist solicited and obtained permission to paint
a portrait of Queen Victoria. The hour and place for the important
undertaking were named. Promptly the queen was present; but the artist
was not when the hour came. He arrived at length, but too late, for her
majesty had departed, leaving a message that she would not return. The
queen had kept her promise, but the artist had failed to keep his, and
thus lost the rare chance to win both fame and fortune.

THE BEST TIME TO QUARREL.

In Lanarkshire, there lived a sma' laird named Hamilton, who was noted
for his eccentricity. On one occasion, a neighbor waited on him, and
requested his name as an accommodation to a bill for twenty pounds at
three months date, which led to the following characteristic and truly
Scottish colloquy:

"Na, na, I canna do that."

"What for no', laird? Ye hae dune the same thing for ithers."

"Ay, ay, Tammas, but there's wheels within wheels ye ken naething aboot;
I canna do 't."

"It's a sma' affair to refuse me, laird."

"Weel, ye see, Tammas, if I was to pit my name till't, ye wad get the
siller frae the bank, and when the time came round, ye wadna be ready,
and I wad hae to pay't; sae then you and me wad quarrel; sae we mae just
as weel quarrel the noo, as lang's the siller's in ma pouch."


1617

In all thy quarrels leave open the door of reconciliation.


1618

To quarrel with one person to please another, is to meet what we
merit,--the displeasure of both.

WHEN IT RAINS.

THE PESSIMIST.

     The rain is coming down in sheets;
       It makes me sad to think about
     The mud that will be in the streets
       And all the crops and things washed out.

THE OPTIMIST.

     This rain will wash the dirt away,
       And leave the pavements nice and clean;
     I needn't use the hose to-day
       To keep the front yard looking green.


1622

My high birth suffocates me. If thou love me, mother, thou wilt not on
all occasions quote my high rank; it is those only who have no peculiar
good in their own nature who are constantly speaking of their noble
birth.

There is one word which may serve as a rule of practice for all one's

1633

Religion is good for nothing one day in the week, unless it is also good
for all the seven days.


1634

Religion is the knowledge of the most excellent truths; the
contemplation of the most glorious objects, and the hope of the most
ravishing pleasures, and the practice of such duties as are most
servicable to our happiness, our peace, our health, our honor, our
prosperity, and our eternal welfare. Virtue needs no outward pomp; her
very countenance is so full of majesty, that the proudest pay her
respect, and the profanest are awed by her presence.


1635

It is rare to see a rich man religious; for religion preaches restraint,
and riches prompt to unlicensed freedom.

Religion lies more in the walk than in the talk.


1637

     Religion presents few difficulties to the humble,
         Many to the proud,
                   Insuperable ones to the vain.


1638

     Religion, if in heavenly truths attired,
     Needs only to be seen to be admired.

REPENTANCE.

     I will to-morrow, that I will,
       I will be sure to do it;
     To-morrow comes, to-morrow goes,
       And still thou art to do it.
     Thus still repentance is deferred,
       From one day to another:
     Until the day of death is come,
       And judgment is the other.

                                              --_Drexelius._

     'Tis not, to cry God mercy, or to sit
     And droop, or to confess that thou hast fail'd:
     'Tis to bewail the sins thou didst commit;
     And not commit those sins thou hast bewail'd,
     He that bewails and not forsakes them too;
     Confesses rather what he means to do.

_Profanity Gently Reproved._--It is related that the excellent John
Wesley, having to travel some distance in a stagecoach, was thereby
brought into the company of an intelligent and gentlemanly officer of
the British army. The officer was very social with his traveling
companions; but the enjoyment, which his society would otherwise have
afforded to those with him, was sadly lessened by the profane
expressions he used.

While stopping at a station, Mr. Wesley called the officer to one side,
and, after expressing the satisfaction he had enjoyed in his company,
told him he felt encouraged to ask of him a very great favor. "I shall
take great pleasure in obliging you," replied the officer, "as I am
certain you would not make an unreasonable request."--"Then," said Mr.
Wesley, "as we are to travel together for some days, I beg that if I
should so far forget myself as to use any profane language, you will
kindly reprove me." The officer immediately perceived how faithfully and
how delicately his own conduct stood reproved, and, smiling, said, "No
one but Mr. Wesley could administer reproof in such manner."

PERFECT RESIGNATION.

It is reported of a person who, being ill, was asked whether she was
willing to live or die; she answered--"Which God pleases." "But," said
one, "if God should refer it to you, which would you choose?" "Truly,"
replied she, "I would at once refer it to Him again."

REST.

     Some seek bread--no more--life's mere subsistence,
       And some seek wealth and ease--the common quest;
     And some seek fame that hovers in the distance;
       But all are seeking rest.


1645

OUR PRESENT NEED.

     Pray, give us rest. A little rest
       From peace-destroying hurry;
     A moment of the quietest,
       As balm for work and worry.

     Pray, give us rest. A little rest
       For people and for nation;
     A moment's time to stop and test
       The purpose of creation.

RUSKIN MEETS SOME TOURISTS.

"I was fated the other day to come from Venice to Verona with a
family--father and mother and two girls--it matters not what country
they came from--presumably rich--girls fifteen and eighteen. I never
before conceived the misery of people who had evidently spent all their
lives in trying to gratify themselves. It was a little warm--warmer than
was entirely luxurious--but nothing in the least harmful. They moaned
and fidgeted and frowned and puffed and stretched and fanned, and ate
lemons, and smelled bottles, and covered their faces, and tore the cover
off again, and had not one thought or feeling during five hours of
traveling in the most noble part of all the world except what four poor
beasts would have had in their end of a menagerie, being dragged about
on a hot day. Add to this misery every form of polite vulgarity, in
methods of doing and saying the common things they said and did. I never
yet saw humanity so degraded (allowing for external circumstances of
every possible advantage) given wealth, attainable education and the
inheritance of eighteen centuries of Christianity."

Sir Thomas Sutton, the founder of the Charter House, was one of the
wealthiest merchants of his day. Fuller tells how he was overheard one
day praying in his garden: "Lord, Thou hast given me a large and liberal
estate; give me also a heart to make use of it."

_The Influence of Riches._--A respectable widow lady, with a very small
income, which she was obliged to eke out by the produce of her own
industry and ingenuity, was remarkable for her generous liberality,
especially in contributing to the cause of religion. When any work of
pious benevolence was going forward, she was always ready to offer a
donation equal to those of persons in comparative affluence. In process
of time this lady came into the possession of an ample fortune, greatly
to the joy of all who knew her willing liberality. But she no longer
came forward unsolicited towards the cause of Christ, and when applied
to, she yielded her aid but coldly and grudgingly, and sometimes excused
herself from giving at all. On one occasion she presented a shilling to
the same cause to which she had formerly given a guinea when in a state
of comparative poverty. Her minister felt it his duty to expostulate
with her, and reminded her of her former generosity when her means were
so circumscribed. "Ah! sir," she affectingly replied; "then I had the
shilling means, but the guinea heart, now I have the guinea means, but
only the shilling heart. Then I received day by day my daily bread, and
I had enough and to spare; now, I have to look at my ample income, but I
live in constant apprehension that I may come to want!"

I remember when Mr. Locke first came over from Italy. Old Dr. Moore, who

not?" "Because he has six thousand a year."

OPULENCE.

Every one who rightly considers it, may know, that eminence and opulence
in the world are not real divine blessings, notwithstanding man, from
the pleasure he finds in them, calls them so; for they pass away, and
also seduce many, and turn them away from heaven; but that eternal life,
and its happiness, are real blessings, which are from the Divine: this
the Lord also teaches in Luke: 12 ch., 33-34. "Make to yourselves a
treasure that faileth not in the heavens, where the thief cometh not,
nor the moth corrupteth; for where your treasure is, there will your
heart be also."

Those persons who are in the habit of avoiding worldly cares on the
Sabbath, are the most remarkable for the perfect performance of their
duties during the week. The influence of a change of thought on the
Sabbath upon the minds of such persons, resembles that of a change of
food upon the body. It seems to give a fresh spring to the mental
operations, as the latter does to the physical.

SABBATH.

     Hail, Sabbath! thee I hail, the poor man's day:
     On other days the man of toil is doom'd

     Both seat and board--screen'd from the winter's cold
     And summer's heat, by neighboring hedge or tree;
     But on _this_ day, embosom'd in his home,
     He shares the frugal meal with those he loves.

SALT.

When Henry Drummond was traveling in tropical Africa, he found that salt
was regarded by the natives as a rare luxury. Often he offered the
native boys the choice between a pinch of salt and a lump of sugar, and
they always chose the salt. Once he presented the head man of a village
with a spoonful of salt. The chief twisted a leaf into a little bag,
into which he poured the salt. Then he held out his hand to the children
who crowded around, and each was allowed one lick of his empty palm.

A NAME ON THE SEA SAND.

     Alone I walked the ocean strand:
     A pearly shell was in my hand;
     I stooped and wrote upon the sand
       My name, the year, the day.
     As onward from the spot I passed,
     One lingering look behind I cast;
     A wave came rolling high and fast
       And washed my lines away.
     And so, methought, 'twill shortly be
     With every mark on earth from me.

The above pretty lines are only superficially true. No man can live on
earth without leaving, "footprints on the sands of time," which will
influence those who come after him for good or evil.

EMULATION IN A SCHOOL.

More is learned in a public than in a private school from emulation:
there is the collision of mind with mind, or the radiation of many minds

THE DAME--SCHOOL.

     Here first I entered, though with toil and pain,
     The low vestibule of learning's fane:
     Entered with pain, yet soon I found the way,
     Though sometimes toilsome, many a sweet display.
     Much did I grieve, on that ill-fated morn,
     When I was first to school reluctant borne;
     Severe I thought the dame, though oft she tried
     To soothe my swelling spirits when I sighed;
     And oft, when harshly she reproved, I wept,
     To my lone corner broken-hearted crept,
     And thought of tender home, where anger never kept.

                  * * * * * * * *

     But soon inured to alphabetic toils,
     Alert I met the dame with jocund smiles;
     First at the form, my task forever true,
     A little favorite rapidly I grew:
     And oft she stroked my head with fond delight,
     Held me a pattern to the dunce's sight;
     And as she gave my diligence its praise,
     Talked of the honors of my future days.

dull boys--not a few who have become distinguished men made no figure at
all in their educational career.

EARLY TRIALS OF DISTINGUISHED SCHOLARS.

It is related of Dr. Adam, the celebrated rector of the High School of
Edinburgh, that when at college he had to be content with a penny roll
for his dinner. Similar, though more severe, were the early trials of
Samuel Drew, also of Edinburgh. At the age of ten he was apprenticed to
a shoemaker, a calling which he continued to follow long after he had
become celebrated as an author. For days and days together in his early
life he was too poor to spend even a penny for his dinner; and he was
accustomed, when dinner-time came, to tie his apron-string tighter to
lessen the pang of hunger, and go on with his work till evening. Through
years of hardship and drudgery his courage never forsook him; amidst
ceaseless labor he strove unremittingly to improve his mind, studying
astronomy, history, and metaphysics; and finally, from the humblest
circumstances, he rose to occupy a conspicuous place as an author, a
philosopher, and a metaphysician.

The life of Balzac too, the French author, whose brilliant abilities won
for him at last such wealth, fame and influence in France, is a type of
many a literary career. At the age of twenty his wealthy parents wished
to make him a notary. He announced his determination to become an
author. "But" urged the father, "do you not know to what state the
occupation of a writer will lead you? In literature a man must be either
king or a hodman." "Very well," replied Balzac, "I will be king!" The
family left town; the youth was left to his fate in a garret, with the
magnificent allowance of twenty-five francs a month. The first ten years
he fought with poverty and all its evils; the second decade made him his
own master. These ten years, says a writer in a British magazine, were
years of glory, wealth, and luxury. He had won the literary crown, as in
youth he predicted. His later residences were palaces, richly decorated,
and full of rare pictures, statuary, and valuable curiosities.

THOUGHTS AT SEA.

There is something grand, even to awfulness, in the thought of utter
helplessness which you feel at sea. Sky and water--with no living thing
visible over the vast expanse--for days together just your own vessel
with its human freight--and God! To a thoughtful mind there is no surer
teaching both of humility and trust.

A secret is seldom safe in more than one breast.

What is known to three is usually known to everybody.

Those who enquire much into the affairs of others are seldom capable of
retaining the secret that they learn; Therefore,

     Shun the inquisitive and curious man,

To keep your own secrets is wisdom; but to expect others to keep them is

CONCEIT OF SELF REBUKED.

"When I was younger than I am now," says a lawyer who is still somewhat
this side of middle age, "I had a position in the office of a man who
has a big reputation. Naturally, I felt my responsibility. It was plain
to me that the head of the firm had outlived his usefulness, and I used
to feel sorry to think what would happen to him if I ever left him.
Sheer magnanimity made me overlook a lot of things.

"I wasn't treated in that office with all the deference due me, but I
stood it till one day somebody went too far. Then I marched into the old
gentleman's private office and laid down the law to him. I told him I
wasn't going to endure such treatment another day. I was going to quit,
that was what I was going to do, and I was going to quit right then and
there. I unburdened my mind freely, and then I stopped to give him a
chance to apologize and beg me not to ruin him by leaving. He didn't
look up from his desk. He said to me in a polite kind of way, 'Please
don't slam the door when you go out.'"

     Self-interest is the compass by which some men
     Do set the course of their opinions.

Remember that self-interest is more likely to warp your judgment than
all other circumstances combined, therefore, look well to your duty when

The question was asked, "Why can we see other people's failings sooner

ourselves?" A sensible man asked in reply, "Why can our eyes see
everything else but themselves?"

_2 Kings x, 16._--"Jehu said, Come with me, and see my zeal for the
Lord."

John Fox, the author of the "Book of Martyrs," was once met by a woman
who showed him a book she was carrying, and said, "See you not that I am
going to a sermon?" The good man replied, "If you will be ruled by me,
go home, for you will do little good to-day at church." "When, then,"
asked she, "would you counsel me to go?" His reply was, "When you tell
no one beforehand."

A CRUSHING ARGUMENT AGAINST MANUSCRIPT SERMONS.

A clergyman thought his people were making rather an unconscionable
objection to his using a manuscript in delivering a sermon.

They urged, "What gars ye tak' up your bit papers to the pu'pit?"

He replied "that it was best, for really he could not remember his
sermons, and he must have the paper."

"Weel, weel, minister, then dinna expect that _we_ can remember them."


1753

PREACHING.

A leading Welsh minister--and Welsh ministers are, I think, among the
best preachers--was invited to preach an anniversary sermon before one
of the great societies in London. Naturally anxious to disregard no
propriety, he consulted the proper authority, the secretary. "Should I
read my sermon?" "Oh, it is no matter, only bring some of your Welsh
fire with you." "But you cannot, my dear sir, carry fire on paper." "No,
that is true; but you may use the paper to kindle the fire."

A SCOTCH PREACHER.

The Rev. John Brown, of Haddington, rose from a poor shepherd boy to
become a distinguished minister, and afterwards a celebrated professor,
author of the "Self-Interpreting Bible," and many other works. Robert
Turnbull said of him in one of his books:--"When a poor shepherd boy, he
conceived the idea of learning Latin and Greek, and having procured a
few old books, actually accomplished the task, while tending his cattle
on the hills. So successful was he that some of the old and
superstitious people in the neighborhood concluded that he must have
been assisted by 'the evil spirit.' On one occasion he went to
Edinburgh, plaided and barefoot, walked into a bookseller's shop, and
asked for a Greek Testament. 'What are you going to do with a Greek
Testament?' said the bookseller. 'Read it,' was the prompt reply. 'Read
it!' exclaimed the sceptical bookseller with a smile; 'ye may have it
for nothing if ye'll read it.' Taking the book, he quietly read off a
few verses, and gave the translation; on which he was permitted to carry
off the Greek Testament in triumph."

          And crossing waters deep,
      How long wouldst Thou be willing to go homeless,
          To find a wandering sheep?"
     "I count not time," the Shepherd gently answered,
         "As thou dost count and bind
      The days in the weeks, the weeks in months;
          My count is just until I find.
      And that should be the limit of my journey,
          I'd cross the waters deep,
      And climb the hill-slopes with untiring patience,
          Until I found my sheep."

A HAPPY USE OF SINGING.

An excellent clergyman, possessing much knowledge of human nature,
instructed his large family of daughters in the theory and practice of
music. They were all observed to be exceedingly amiable and happy. A
friend inquired if there was any secret in his mode of education. He
replied--"When anything disturbs their temper, I say to them _sing_, and
if I hear them speaking against any person, I call them to sing to me;
and so they have sung away all causes of discontent, and every
disposition to scandal."

SLANDER AND EVIL SPEAKING.

A lady who had been in the habit of spreading slanderous reports once
confessed her fault to St. Philip Neri, who lived several hundred years
ago. She asked him how she could cure it. "Go," he said in reply, "to
the nearest market-place, buy a chicken just killed, pluck its feathers
all the way, and come back to me." She was greatly surprised, wondering
in what way a dead chicken could help her overcome her evil habit; but
she did as he bade her, and came back to him with the plucked chicken in
her hand. "Now go back," he said, "and bring me all the feathers you
have scattered." "But this is impossible," she replied: "I cast the
feathers carelessly, and the wind carried them away; how can I recover
them?" "That," he said, "is exactly like your words of slander. They
have been carried about in every direction. You cannot recall them. Go
and slander no more." It was a striking way of teaching a very important
lesson.

SLAVERY.

     Above his brethren, to himself assuming
     Authority usurp'd, from God not given.
     He gave us only over beast, fish, fowl,
     Dominion absolute; that right we hold
     By His donation; but man over men

     Reserving, human left from human--free.

_Sleep._--Even sleep is characteristic. How charming are children in
their lovely innocence! How angel-like their blooming hue! How painful
and anxious is the sleep and expression in the countenance of the
guilty.

The sleep of a laboring man is sweet, whether he eat little or much: but
the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.

     Sleep! to the homeless, thou art home,
       The friendless find in thee a friend;
     And well is, wheresoe'r he roams,
       Who meets thee at his journey's end.

1791

A RESTFUL PREACHER.

Dean Ramsey relates that the Earl of Lauderdale was alarmingly ill, one
distressing symptom being a total absence of sleep, without which the
medical men declared he could not recover. His son, who was somewhat
simple, was seated under the table, and cried out, "Sen' for that
preaching man frae Livingstone, for fayther aye sleeps in the kirk." One
of the doctors thought the hint worth attending to, and the experiment
of "getting a minister till him" succeeded, for sleep came on and the
earl recovered.


1792

     Come sleep, O sleep! the certain knot of peace,
     The poor man's wealth, the prisoner's release,
     The indifferent judge between the high and low!

1793

                                  Sleep.
     Do not omit the heavy offer of it;
     It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,
     It is a comforter.

                                            --_Shakespeare._


1794

     Sleep, thou patron of mankind,
     Great physician of the mind,
     Who dost nor pain nor sorrow know,
     Sweetest balm of every woe.

1795

Sleep has often been mentioned as the image of death, so like it, that
we should not trust it without prayer.

MYSTERY OF SLEEP.

     What mortal knows
     Whence came the tint and odor of the rose?
     What probing deep
     Has ever solved the mystery of sleep?

1797

SMILES ALWAYS ATTRACTIVE.

Whether seen playing upon the face of young innocence, or upon the
furrowed visage of venerable age, smiles are always attractive and
blissful. He who wears a smiling face is a practical philanthropist. He
dispels the clouds of gloom that overshadow the brows of care, and the
hearts of sorrow he meets in his life-paths, as the sun dispels the
misty clouds of morning from the face of nature.


1798

A smile is ever more bright and beautiful with a tear upon it.


1799

Put a smile on your face when you go out for a walk, and it will be
surprising how many pleasant people you will meet.


1800

Who can tell the value of a smile? It costs the giver nothing, but is
beyond price to the erring and relenting, the sad and cheerless.

WHEN ADAM SMITH PROPOSED.

A new story of Adam Smith was told recently at a convention in Kirkaldy,
Scotland, the birthplace of the economist. The professor fell in love
and proposed. The offer was refused. Next day the lady met Smith in
Princess street, Edinburgh, and reopened the question of the proposal,
about which she had been thinking. "You remember what I said?" the lady
inquired, and the philosopher replied that he did. "Well," added the
lady, "I was only joking." "You remember what I asked?" said Smith.
"Yes" replied the lady. "Well," said Smith, "I was only joking too."

It is said that Sir Walter Raleigh once made a wager with Queen
Elizabeth that he could weigh the smoke from his tobacco pipe. He
weighed the tobacco before smoking, and the ashes afterwards. When
Elizabeth paid the wager, she said, "I have seen many a man turn his
gold into smoke, but you are first who has turned his smoke into gold."

company, and rather to seem well entertained with them, than to bring
entertainment to them.

LONGING FOR SOLITUDE.

     Oh, for a lodge in some vast wilderness,
     Some boundless contiguity of shade,
     Where rumor of oppression and deceit,
     Might never reach me more! my ear is pain'd,
     My soul is sick, with every day's report
     Of wrong and outrage, with which earth is fill'd.

TO MY DEAR SON.

     _On his 21st Birthday, with a Silver Lamp, "Fiat Lux."_
     --_Lady Dufferin, 1807-1867._

     How shall I bless thee? Human love
       Is all too poor in passionate words;
     The heart aches with a sense above
       All language that the lip affords:
     Therefore a symbol shall express
       My love,--a thing not rare or strange,
     But yet--eternal--measureless--
       Knowing no shadow and no change.
     Light! which of all the lovely shows
       To our poor world of shadows given,
     The fervent prophet-voices chose
       Alone, as attribute of heaven!

     At a most solemn pause we stand,
       From this day forth, for evermore,
     The weak but loving human hand
       Must cease to guide thee as of yore.
     Then, as thro' life thy footsteps stray,
       And earthly beacons dimly shine,
     "Let there be light" upon thy way,
       And holier guidance far than mine!
     "Let there be light" in thy clear, clear soul,
       When passion tempts and doubts assail;
     When grief's dark tempests o'er thee roll,
       "Let there be light" that shall not fail!

     So, angel-guarded, may'st thou tread
       The narrow path which few may find,
     And at the end, look back, nor dread
       To count the vanished years behind!
     And pray that she, whose hand doth trace
       This heart-warm prayer,--when life is past--
     May see and know thy blessed face,
       In God's own glorious light at last!

                           --_From the Victorian Anthology_,

A clever man once said to his son: "John, when you chase the dollars,
all right; but look out, my boy, when the dollars chase you."

Send your son into the world with good principles, a good education, and
industrious habits, and he will find his way in the dark.

TO MY SON.

Some of the rarest gems and most beautiful flowers are often found in
out-of-the-way places. Here is one.

     Do you know that your soul is of my soul, such part,
     That you seem to be fibre and core of my heart?
     None other can pain me as you, dear, can do;
     None other can please me or praise me as you.
     Remember the world will be quick with its blame
     If shadow or stain ever darken your name.
     "Like mother, like son," is a saying so true,
     The world will judge largely of "mother" by you.
     Be yours then the task, if task it shall be,
     To force this proud world to do homage to me;
     Be sure it will say, when its verdict you've won.
     "She reaps as she sowed, lo, this man is her son."

HIS FATHER'S ABILITY.

At ten years of age a boy thinks his father knows a great deal;

At fifteen he knows as much as his father;

At twenty he knows twice as much;

At thirty he is willing to take his advice;

At forty he begins to think his father knows something, after all;

At fifty he begins to seek his advice;

And at sixty, after his father is dead, he thinks he was the smartest
man that ever lived.

Sorrow's best antidote is employment.


1821

There are people who are always anticipating trouble, and in this way
they manage to enjoy many sorrows that never really happen to them.

The love of the poor, to the poor, is often remarked: Privation and
sorrow knit hearts as no bands of gold can.

1823

     If hearty sorrow
     Be a sufficient ransom for offense,
     I tender it here; I do as truly suffer
     As e'er I did commit.

                                            --_Shakespeare._

1828

BRIEF PULSATIONS OF JOY.

The little that I have seen in the world, and known of the history of
mankind, teaches me to look upon their errors in sorrow, not in anger.
When I take the history of one poor heart that has sinned and suffered,
and represent to myself the struggles and temptations it passed through,
the brief pulsations of joy, the tears of regret, the feebleness of
purpose, the scorn of the world that has little charity, the desolation
of the soul's sanctuary, and threatening voices within, health gone,
happiness gone,--I would fain leave the erring soul of my fellow-man
with Him from whose hands it came.

                                             --_Longfellow._


1829

     Sum up at night what thou hast done by day,
       And in the morning what thou hast to do.
     Dress and undress thy soul, mark the decay
       And growth of it; since we shall be
       Most surely judged, make thy accounts agree.

                                         --_George Herbert._


1830

SOMEWHERE.

     Somewhere, beyond the limitless space,
     That mantles the stars, there is a place;
     A beautiful place, where angels dwell.
     Somewhere--but just where, no one can tell.

     Nowhere on this realm, from pole to pole,
     Did God appoint a home for the soul;
     Yet "somewhere," above yon starry dome
     There's a "house not made with hands," a home.

     There, all is fragrant with sweet perfume
     That falls from flowers which ever bloom;
     In that far-off unknown land so fair.
     Where the great Redeemer dwells--'tis there.

Loose thinking leads to inaccurate speech.

     Forbear sharp speeches to her. She's a lady
     So tender of rebukes, that words are strokes,
     And strokes death to her.

STORY OF A STANZA.

Many years ago Dr. Valpy, a well known English scholar, wrote a little
verse of four lines as the longing of his heart and the confession of
his faith. This was the simple stanza:--

     "In peace let me resign my breath,
        And Thy salvation see;
      My sins deserve eternal death,
        But Jesus died for me."

Some time afterwards he gave this verse to his friend Dr. Marsh, and it
became a great blessing to him. Dr. Marsh read the lines to his friend
Lord Roden, who was so impressed with them that he got the doctor to
write them out, and then fastened the paper over the mantlepiece in his
study, and there, yellow with age, they hung for many years.

MAN'S LITTLENESS IN PRESENCE OF THE STARS.

     Thou, proud man, look upon yon starry vault,
     Survey the countless gems which richly stud
     The night's imperial chariot;--Telescopes
     Will show the myriads more, innumerous
     As the sea-sand:--each of those little lamps
     Is the great source of light, the central sun
     Round which some other mighty sisterhood
     Of planets travel,--every planet stocked
     With living beings impotent, as thee.
     Now, proud man--now, where is thy greatness fled?
     What art thou in the scale of universe?
     Less, less than nothing!

If a man be gracious unto strangers, it shows he is a citizen of the

Be willing to pity the misery of the stranger! Thou givest to-day thy
bread to the poor; to-morrow the poor may give it to thee.

THE PASSING STRANGER.

     He passed me on the street,
     And never guessed
     The strength he gave my heart,
     And needed rest.

     His noble face so shone
     With holiness,
     The very sight of it
     Could not but bless.

     I met him only once
     Upon my way,
     Many years ago,
     And yet to-day

     That face of light and strength
     Still dwells with me;
     The man "had been with God"--
     'Twas plain to see.

FOOD FOR THOUGHT.

At a gathering in Australia, not long since, four persons met, three of
whom were shepherds on a sheep-farm. One of these had taken a degree at
Oxford, another at Cambridge, the third at a German university. The
fourth was their employer, a squatter, rich in flocks and herds, but
scarcely able to read and write, much less to keep accounts.


1854

SUCCESSFUL MEN WHO WERE NOT RICH.

A sense of the power and luxury in money, beyond all the wonder tales,
has suddenly come to us.

In times like these, it is good to remember Agassiz, who refused to
lecture at five hundred dollars a night because he was too busy to make
money; Spurgeon, who refused to go to America to deliver fifty lectures
at one thousand dollars a night, saying he could do better--he could
stay in London and try to save fifty souls; and Emerson, who steadfastly
declined to increase his income beyond one thousand two hundred dollars
because he wanted his time to think.

                     --_F. Bellamy in Everybody's Magazine._


1855

     Attempt the end, and never stand to doubt,
     Nothing's so hard but search will find it out.

                                                --_Herrick._


1856

Those who accomplish great things always begin with little things.


1857

FOR LITTLE BOYS AND GIRLS TO KNOW.

A boy of twelve, said to his little companion: "Do you know why Sunday
was instituted from the seventh to the first day of the week." "No, I
don't," replied the little boy, "I wish you would tell me." "Well, I
will, and I know it is true, for my father told me: It was instituted
from Saturday to Sunday in remembrance of Christ's resurrection from the
dead on the first day of the week."

A GOOD TEST.

A respectable merchant of London having become embarrassed in his
circumstances, and his misfortunes being one day the subject of
conversation in the Royal Exchange, several persons expressed the great
sympathy they felt for him; whereupon a foreigner who was present, said,
"I feel five hundred pounds for him; what do _you_ feel?"


1870

     A clasp of hands will oft reveal
     A sympathy that makes us feel
       Ourselves again; we lose our care:
     And in our heart's first glad rebound
     At tender sympathy new found,
       The world once more seems bright and fair.

I LAY IN SORROW, DEEP DISTRESSED.

     I lay in sorrow, deep distressed:
       My grief a proud man heard;
     His looks were cold, he gave me gold,
       But not a kindly word.
     My sorrow passed,--I paid him back
       The gold he gave to me;
     Then stood erect and spoke my thanks,
       And blessed his charity.

     I lay in want, in grief and pain:
       A poor man passed my way;
     He bound my head, he gave me bread,
       He watched me night and day.
     How shall I pay him back again,
       For all he did to me?
     Oh, gold is great, but greater far
       Is Heavenly Sympathy.

ONE VIEW OF THEATRES.

The chief reason why no Christian should attend the theatre is the
character of a large majority of plays put on the stage.

Listen to what the play-writers and actors themselves say:

M. Dumas, a French writer of plays, wrote: "Never take your daughter to
the theatre; it is not merely the work that is immoral, it is the
place."

W. C. Macready, the great actor, said: "None of my children shall ever,
with my consent, enter a theatre, or have any visiting connection with
actors or actresses."

Edwin Booth, the great tragedian, wrote: "My knowledge of the modern
theatre is so very meagre that I never permit my wife or daughter to
witness a play without previously ascertaining its character. The
theatre is permitted to be a mere shop for gain, open to every huckster
of immoral adventures,--jimcracks."

Fanny Kemble, the actress, confessed that life on the stage was
unhealthy to morals, and said: "I never presented myself before an
audience without a shirking feeling of reluctance, or without thinking
the excitement I had undergone unhealthy, and the personal exhibition
odious."

1905

Don't despise a slight wound, or a poor relative.

Never despise small things, for we were all infants before we became
men, and pupils, ere we became teachers.

1908

At a dinner when Daniel Webster was Secretary of State, after a period
of silence which fell upon the company of some twenty gentlemen who were
present, one of the guests said, "Mr. Webster, will you tell us what was
the most important thought that ever occupied your mind?" Webster slowly
passed his hand over his forehead, and in a low tone enquired of one
near him, "Is there any one here who does not know me?" "No; all are
your friends." "The most important thought that ever occupied my mind,"
said Webster, "was that of my individual responsibility to God." And
after speaking on this subject in the most solemn strain for fully ten
minutes, he silently rose from the table and retired to his room. This
incident serves to illustrate the attitude of great minds towards
eternal things. Great men are not scoffers. The men of flippant jeers
and godless jests are invariably men of small calibre and shallow
intellect.

THUNDER.--A LOVER OF

Such was the spirit of a venerable [1913:A]patriarch--who shed on a very
humble station the lustre of brilliant graces--that, when the storm sent
others in haste to their homes, he was wont to leave his own, and to
stand with upturned face, raised eye, and with his grey head uncovered,
to watch the flash and listen to the music of the roaring thunder. How
fine his reply to those who expressed their wonder at his aspect and
attitude--"It's my Father's voice, and I like well to hear it!" What a
sublime example of the perfect love that casteth out fear?

ONE WAY OF ACQUIRING A TITLE.

"From time immemorial," said Judge Asher Carruth, of London, "Southern
people have been lavish in bestowing titles. I think there is something
in the Southern temperament which explains this. I didn't start out on
this, however, for a philosophical disquisition, but rather to tell how
a certain Kentucky gentleman established valid title to the rank of
Colonel. He went to Cincinnati once with a friend, who enjoyed many
acquaintances there; and who introduced him to every one as Colonel
Brown. Everything went along smoothly until finally one Cincinnatian
asked of the introducer:

"I suppose your friend Colonel Brown was in the Confederate army?"

"No, sir; he was not."

"Well, then, he fought on the Union side?"

"You are wrong there, too."

"Oh, I see now; he got his title by serving in the State militia?"

"No, he never entered the militia."

"Then, how did he get to be a colonel?"

"He drew a sword, sir, at a church fair!"

INFLUENCES OF FOREIGN TRAVEL.

One of the remarks which an American is expected to make on returning
from a foreign tour, especially his first return, is: "Well I'm a better
American for having gone abroad," meaning that foreign travel has
increased his love for his own country--in other words, has toned up his
patriotism. * * * * * * * *

Foreign travel will make any intelligent American a better citizen,
because an increase of knowledge is a betterment. One honored resident
of Washington, a gentleman past middle life, recently returned from his
first European tour, and on being asked if he could make the stereotyped
report of having been "made a better American," replied: "Yes; I think I
am a better American for having had a deal of conceit knocked out of
me." That was a profitable experience.

It will be observed, that when giving me (Boswell) advice as to my
travels, Dr. Johnson did not dwell upon cities, and palaces, and
pictures, and shows. He was of Lord Essex's opinion, who advises his
kinsman, Roger, Earl of Rutland, "rather to go a hundred miles to speak
with one wise man, than five miles to see a fair town."

_Deuteronomy xxxiii, 19_--"They shall suck of the abundance of the seas,
and of the treasures hid in the sand."

Among the hardships experienced by the first settlers in North America,
they were sometimes greatly distressed for food, which led the women and
the children to the sea side to look for a ship which they expected with
provisions, but no ship appeared for many weeks; they saw in the sand,
however, vast quantities of shellfish, since called clams, a species of
muscle. Hunger impelled them to taste, and at length they fed wholly
upon them, and were as cheerful and well as they had been before in
England, enjoying the best provision. It is added, that a good man,
after they had all dined one day on clams, without bread, returned
thanks to God for causing them to "suck of the abundance of the seas,
and of treasures hid in the sand." This text, which they had never
before observed particularly, was ever after endeared to them.

THE BEECH TREE'S PETITION.

     O leave this barren spot to me:
     Spare, woodman, spare the beechen tree!
     Though bush or floweret never grow
     My dark unwarming shade below;
     Nor summer bud perfume the dew,
     Of rosy blush, or yellow hue!
     Nor fruits of autumn, blossom-born,
     My green and glossy leaves adorn;
     Nor murmuring tribes from me derive
     Th' ambrosial amber of the hive;
     Yet leave this barren spot to me:
     Spare, woodman, spare the beechen tree!

     Thrice twenty summers I have seen
     The sky grow bright, the forest green;
     And many a wintry wind have stood
     In bloomless, fruitless solitude,
     Since childhood in my pleasant bower
     First spent its sweet and sportive hour,
     Since youthful lovers in my shade
     Their vows of truth and rapture made;
     And on my trunk's surviving frame
     Carved many a long-forgotten name.
     Oh! by the sighs of gentle sound,
     First breathed upon this sacred ground;
     By all that Love has whisper'd here,
     Or Beauty heard with ravished ear;
     As Love's own altar honor me:
     Spare, woodman, spare the beechen tree!

Mr. George Herbert, the poet, when walking to Salisbury, saw a poor
man, with a poorer horse, fallen under his load. Mr. Herbert perceiving
this, put off his canonical coat, and helped the poor man to unload, and
after to load his horse. The poor man blessed him for it, and he blessed
the poor man, and gave him money to refresh both himself and his horse;
and told him, "If he loved himself, he should be merciful to his beast."
At his coming to his musical friends at Salisbury, they began to wonder
that Mr. George Herbert, who used to be so clean, came in such a
condition; but he told them the occasion; and when one of the company
told him, "he had disparaged himself by so dirty an employment," his
answer was, "That the thought of what he had done would prove music to
him at midnight; and the omission of it would have upbraided and made
discord in his conscience, whensoever he should pass by the place."

PERFECT TRUST AND RESIGNATION.

During the Rabbi's absence from home, two of his sons died. Their mother
hiding her grief, awaited the father's return, and then said to him. "My
husband, some time since two jewels of inestimable value were placed
with me for safe keeping. He who left them with me called for them
to-day, and I delivered them into His hands." "That is right," said the
Rabbi approvingly. "We must always return cheerfully and faithfully all
that is placed in our care." Shortly after this, the Rabbi asked for his
sons, and the mother, taking him by the hand, led him gently to the
chamber of death. Meir gazed upon his sons, and realizing the truth,
wept bitterly. "Weep not, beloved husband," said his noble wife; "didst
thou not say to me we must return cheerfully, when called for, all that
has been placed under our care? God gave us these jewels; He left them
with us for a time, and we gloried in their possession; but now that He
calls for His own, we should not repine."

_In Boswell's Life of Johnson_, he says:--Next morning, while we were at
breakfast, Johnson gave a very earnest recommendation of what he himself
practised with the utmost conscientiousness: I mean a strict attention
to truth, even in the most minute particulars. "Accustom your children,"
said he, "constantly to this: If a thing happened at one window, and
they, when relating it, say that it happened at another, do not let it
pass, but instantly check them; you do not know where deviation from
truth will end."

I once asked a deaf and dumb boy, "What is truth?" He replied by
thrusting his finger forward in a straight line. I then asked him "What
is falsehood?" when he made a zigzag with his finger. Try to remember

as straight as an arrow to its mark, and shrink from falsehood, as you
would from a viper.

TRUE TO TRUTH.

In an Eastern land a boy once set out from his mother's home for a
distant city, where he was to begin life and earn his livelihood. Before
parting with him, his mother gave him forty gold dinars, which, for
safety, she sewed inside his waistcoat. Her last counsel to him was, to
seek and to follow always the truth. On his way he had to cross part of
a desert, infested by robbers. One of these saw him and came galloping
up "Boy, what money have you got?" he sternly demanded. The boy looked
up at him, and said, "I have forty gold dinars sewed up in my
waistcoat." The robber burst into a fit of laughter; he thought the boy
was joking. And, turning his horse, he galloped back to his troop.
By-and-by, another horseman rode up to the boy as he trudged on, and
made the same demand: "Boy, what have you got?" "Forty gold dinars,
sewed up in my waistcoat," said the boy again. This robber, too, burst
out laughing, and turned away, thinking the boy was making fun of him.
They had some talk in their band about the boy's strange reply. Their
leader turning it over in his mind, said he would like to see him, and,
leaving the troop, soon overtook the young traveler. He put the same
question as the others, and again the boy gave the same answer. The
captain leapt off his horse, and began to feel the boy's clothes, till
he counted--one, two, three--the forty gold dinars just as he had been
told. "What made you tell the truth, my boy?" he asked. "My God and my
mother, sir," was the reply. "Wait for me here a little," said the
captain, and galloped back to his troop. In a few minutes he returned,
but so changed that the boy hardly knew him. By removing a false beard
and other disguises, his appearance was quite altered. "Come with me, my
lad," he said; and he pointed to the spires of a distant city. "I cannot
go with you," said the boy; "you are a robber!" "I was," the man said,
"but all that is over now! I have given it up forever. I have a large
business in yonder city, and I wish you to come with me and share it."
And so they went on together; and when they arrived at the city the boy
entered his employment, and ultimately became very wealthy and
influential.

A TOUCHING SCENE AT SEA.

Two weeks ago on board an English steamer, a little ragged boy, aged
nine years, was discovered on the fourth day of the voyage out from
Liverpool to New York, and carried before the first mate, whose duty it
was to deal with such cases. When questioned as to his object of being
stowed away, and who brought him on board, the boy, who had a beautiful
sunny face, and eyes that looked like the very mirrors of truth, replied
that his step-father did it, because he could not afford to keep him,
nor pay his passage out to Halifax, where he had an aunt who was well
off, and to whose house he was going. The mate did not believe the
story, in spite of the winning face and truthful accents of the boy. He
had seen too much of stow-aways to be easily deceived by them, he said;
and it was his firm conviction that the boy had been brought on board
and provided with food by the sailors. The little fellow was very
roughly handled in consequence. Day by day he was questioned and
re-questioned, but always with the same result. He did not know a sailor
on board, and his father alone had secreted him and given him the food
which he ate. At last the mate, wearied by the boy's persistence in the
same story, and perhaps a little anxious to inculpate the sailors,
seized him one day by the collar, and, dragging him to the fore, told
him that unless he would tell the truth in ten minutes from that time,
he would hang him from the yard-arm. He then made him sit down under it
on the deck. All around him were the passengers and sailors of the
midway watch, and in front of him stood the inexorable mate, with his
chronometer in his hand, and the other officers of the ship by his side.
It was the finest sight, said our informant, that he ever beheld--to see
the pale, proud, sorrowful face of that noble boy, his head erect, his
beautiful blue eyes bright through the tears that suffused them. When
eight minutes had fled, the mate told him he had but two minutes to
live, and advised him to speak the truth and save his life; but he
replied with the utmost simplicity and sincerity by asking the mate if
he might pray. The mate said nothing, but nodded his head and turned
deadly pale, and shook with trembling like a reed with the wind, and
there, all eyes turned on him, the brave and noble little fellow, this
poor waif, whom society owned not, and whose own step-father could not
care for him--there he knelt, with clasped hands, and eyes turned to
heaven, while he repeated audibly the Lord's prayer, and prayed the Lord
Jesus to take him to heaven. Sobs broke from strong, hard hearts, as the
mate sprang forward to the boy, and clasped him to his bosom, and kissed
him and blessed him, and told him how sincerely he believed his story,
and how glad he was that he had been brave enough to face death and be
willing to sacrifice his life for the truth of his word.

REWARD OF TRUTHFULNESS.

When Aristotle, the Grecian philosopher, who was tutor to Alexander the
Great, was asked what a man could gain by uttering falsehoods, he
replied, "Not to be credited when he shall tell the truth." On the other
hand, it is related that when Petrarch, the Italian poet, a man of
strict integrity, was summoned as a witness, and offered in the usual
manner to take an oath before a court of justice, the judge closed the
book, saying, "As to you, Petrarch, your _word_ is sufficient."

SPEAK GENTLY.

"Please buy my penny songs!" cried a feeble voice in one of the streets
of a great city. The day was very cold, and little Katie had left her
cheerless home to earn, if possible, a few pennies. Poor Katie! Her
little voice was feeble because her heart was sad, for so many passed
her by unnoticed; and she felt almost discouraged.

Soon she found herself in a music store, standing near a beautiful lady,
who was sitting there selecting music. She again uttered her little cry,
"Please buy a penny song!" but the lady, not hearing what she said,
turned towards her, and, with the kindest, sweetest smile, said gently,
"What is it, darling?" at the same time putting a piece of money in her
hand. Katie, not thinking what she did, laid her head in the lady's lap,
and cried as though her heart would break. The lady tried to soothe her;
and soon Katie said, "O lady! I cry, not because you gave money, but
because you spoke so kindly to me."

PALACE AND SWEATSHOP.

     A lady sits in her boudoir
       Languid with leisure's disease,
     World-weary and worn with ennui--
       Society fails to please;
     She craves fresh scenes more alluring
       But where is anything new?
     She's tired of luxury's gilding,
       Weary of nothing to do.

     Her life seems empty and useless,
       A played out, frivolous game,
     Where fawning counterfeits friendship
       And love is only a name;
     Heart-sick she sulks in seclusion
       And scans in mental review,
     Her social realm and the follies
       She knows are weak and untrue.

     Thus over her life she ponders,
       Scorning, rebellious in vain,
     Till impelled by social custom
       She resumes her mask again;
     Her world must not find her sighing--
       She brilliantly plays her part,
     And bravely the queen of pleasure
       Smiles still with an aching heart.

     And the sweat-shop wolf is prowling
       For aye in the street below.

A BEAUTIFUL CHERRY TREE.

When George Washington was a boy, a beautiful cherry tree was killed in
his father's garden, by some violent hand stripping its bark. Mr.
Washington said he would not have taken five guineas for the tree, and
he would like to know the offender. Shortly after, seeing George with
an axe in his hand, he asked him if he knew who had killed the cherry
tree. George hesitated for a moment, then said, "I cannot tell a lie,
father, I cannot tell a lie. I cut it with the hatchet." "Come to my
arms," said his father; "you have paid for it a thousand times." Such an
act of heroism in telling the truth he valued more than a thousand
cherry trees.

A RECOMMENDATION.

The following verses were sent to a graduate of Wheaton Seminary of the
class of 1866 by John G. Whittier, on the receipt of two pairs of long
stockings, which the young woman had knit. She was a frequent visitor in
the Whittier home, and often assisted in the entertainment of guests of
honor. Mr. Whittier regarded the verses as doggerel, and expressed his
intention of writing something worth while for his youthful admirer. But
the poem reveals a humorous side of his character, differing from what
one finds in his published poetry, and it is probable that neither Mr.
Whittier nor his young friend, who died in her early womanhood, would
have objected to the publication of the verses.

      My neighbor Acres said to me,
       "I lead a lonesome life.
      There's something lacking all the time,
        I think I need a wife.

     "I'm weary of my empty rooms
        And stockings never mended.
      If you could think of some nice girl
        I'd feel myself befriended."

      I sat and pondered for a space,
        And then I spake up gaily:
     "You just go down the Ferry road
        And ask for Mary Bailey.

     "She's bright as is a new-made cent
        And smart as any steel trap;
      I tell you grass will never grow
        Beneath her restless heel-tap.

     "A wiser little head than hers
        Was never found a hat in;
      She reads a thousand books a year,
        And talks in Dutch and Latin.

     "She always has a stylish dress,
        And dainty slippered feet,
      She's money in the savings-bank
        Her every want to meet."

      He sadly mused, "That sort of thing
        Will never do, you see.
      A wife that's all accomplishments
        Is not the wife for me."

      A lucky thought was mine. I kicked
        Right off my old brogan,
      And pulled my trousers to the knee.
       "Look here, you foolish man!

     "These stockings by her hands were knit."
       "Why, sakes alive," cried he.
     "The modern girl who knits like that
        Is just the girl for me."

ADVICE TO A WIFE.

     Fie! fie! unknit that threat'ning, unkind brow,
     And dart not scornful glances from those eyes,
     To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor;
     It blots thy beauty, as frost bite the meads;
     Confounds thy fame, as whirlwinds shake fair buds;
     And in no sense is meet or amiable.
     A woman mov'd is like a fountain troubled,
     Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty;
     And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty
     Will deign to sip, or touch one drop of it.
     Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,
     Thy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee,
     And for thy maintenance commits his body
     To painful labour both by sea and land;
     To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,
     While thou liest warm at home, secure and safe,
     And craves no other tribute at thy hands,
     But love, fair looks, and true obedience:
     Too little payment for so great a debt.
     Such duty as one owes a prince,
     Even such, a woman oweth to her husband:
     And when she's froward, peevish, sullen, sour,
     And not obedient to his honest will,
     What is she but a foul contending rebel
     And graceless traitor to her loving lord?
     I am asham'd that women are so simple
     To offer war, where they should kneel for peace;
     Or seek for rule, supremacy and sway,
     When they are bound to serve, love, and obey.

I AM YOUR WIFE.

     Oh, let me lay my head to-night upon your breast,
     And close my eyes against the light, I fain would rest,
     I'm weary, and the world looks sad; this worldly strife
     Turns me to you; and, oh I'm glad to be your wife!
     Though friends may fail or turn aside, yet I have you
     And in your love I may abide, for you are true--
     My only solace in each grief and in despair,
     Your tenderness is my relief; it soothes each care.
     If joys of life could alienate this poor weak heart
     From yours, then may no pleasure great enough to part
     Our sympathies fall to my lot. I'd e'er remain
     Bereft of friends, though true or not, just to retain
     Your true regard, your presence bright, thro' care and strife
     And, oh! I thank my God to-night, I am your wife!

THE WIFE.

I have often had occasion to remark the fortitude with which women
sustain the most overwhelming reverses of fortune. Those disasters
which break down the spirit of a man, and prostrate him in the dust,
seem to call forth all the energies of the softer sex, and give such
intrepidity and elevation to their character, that at times it
approaches to sublimity. Nothing can be more touching, than to behold a
soft and tender female, who had been all weakness and dependence, and
alive to every trivial roughness, while threading the prosperous paths
of life, suddenly rising in mental force to be the comforter and
supporter of her husband under misfortune and abiding with unshrinking
firmness, the bitterest blasts of adversity.

As the vine which has long twined its graceful foliage about the oak,
and been lifted by it into sunshine, will, when the hardy plant is
rifted by the thunder-bolt, cling round it with its caressing tendrils,
and bind up its shattered boughs; so it is beautifully ordered by
Providence, that woman who is the mere dependent and ornament of man in
his happier hours, should be his stay and solace when smitten with
calamity; winding herself into the rugged recesses of his nature,
tenderly supporting the drooping head, and binding up the broken heart.

I was once congratulating a friend, who had around him a blooming
family, knit together in the strongest affection. "I can wish you no
better lot," said he, with enthusiasm, "than to have a wife and
children. If you are prosperous, there they are to share your
prosperity; if otherwise, there they are to comfort you." And, indeed, I
have observed that a married man, falling into misfortune, is more apt
to retrieve his situation in the world than a single one; partly because
he is more stimulated to exertion by the necessities of the helpless and
beloved beings who depend upon him for subsistence; but chiefly because
his spirits are soothed and relieved by domestic endearments, and his
self-respect kept alive by finding, that though all abroad is darkness
and humiliation, yet there is still a little world of love at home, of
which he is the monarch. Whereas, a single man is apt to run to waste
and self-neglect; to fancy himself lonely and abandoned, and his heart
to fall to ruin, like some deserted mansion, for want of an inhabitant.

These observations call to mind a little domestic story, of which I was
once a witness. My intimate friend, Leslie, had married a beautiful and
accomplished girl, who had been brought up in the midst of fashionable
life. She had, it is true, no fortune, but that of my friend was ample;
and he delighted in the anticipation of indulging her in elegant
pursuit, and administering to those delicate tastes and fancies that
spread a kind of witchery about the sex.--"Her life," said he, "shall be
like a fairy tale."

The very difference in their characters produced a harmonious
combination; he was of a romantic and somewhat serious cast; she was all
life and gladness. I have often noticed the mute rapture with which he
would gaze upon her in company, of which her sprightly powers made her
the delight; and how, in the midst of applause, her eye would still turn
to him, as if there alone she sought favor and acceptance. When leaning
on his arm, her slender form contrasted finely with his tall, manly
person. The fond confiding air with which she looked up to him seemed to
call forth a flush of triumphant pride and cherishing tenderness, as if
he doted on his lovely burden for its very helplessness. Never did a
couple set forward on a flowery path of early and well-suited marriage
with a fairer prospect of felicity.

It was the misfortune of my friend, however, to have embarked his
property in large speculations; and he had not been married many months
when, by a succession of sudden disasters, it was swept from him, and he
found himself reduced to almost penury. For a time he kept his situation
to himself, and went about with a haggard countenance and a breaking
heart. His life was but a protracted agony; and what rendered it more
insupportable was the necessity of keeping up a smile in the presence
of his wife; for he could not bring himself to overwhelm her with the
news. She saw, however, with the quick eyes of affection, that all was
not well with him. She marked his altered looks and stifled sighs, and
was not to be deceived by his sickly and vapid attempts at cheerfulness.
She tasked all her sprightly powers and tender blandishments to win him
back to happiness; but she only drove the arrow deeper into his soul.
The more he saw cause to love her, the more torturing was the thought
that he was soon to make her wretched. A little while, thought he, and
the smile will banish from that cheek--the song will die away from those
lips--the lustre of those eyes will be quenched with sorrow--and the
happy heart which now beats lightly in that bosom will be weighed down,
like mine, by the cares and miseries of the world.

At length he came to me one day, and related his whole situation in a
tone of the deepest despair. When I had heard him through, I inquired,
"Does your wife know all this?" At the question he burst into an agony
of tears. "For God's sake!" cried he, "if you have any pity on me, don't
mention my wife; it is the thought of her that drives me almost to
distraction!"

"And why not?" said I:--"She must know it sooner or later: you cannot
keep it long from her, and the intelligence may break upon her in a more
startling manner than if imparted by yourself; for the accents of those
we love soften the harshest tidings. Besides, you are depriving yourself
of the comforts of her sympathy; and not merely that, but also
endangering the only bond that can keep hearts together--an unreserved
community of thought and feeling. She will soon perceive that something
is secretly preying upon your mind; and true love will not brook
reserve: it feels undervalued and outraged, when even the sorrows of
those it loves are concealed from it."

"Oh, but my friend! to think what a blow I am to give to all her future
prospects--how I am to strike her very soul to the earth, by telling her
that her husband is a beggar!--that she is to forego all the elegancies
of life--all the pleasures of society--to shrink with me into indigence
and obscurity! To tell her that I have dragged her down from the sphere
in which she might have continued to move in constant brightness--the
light of every eye--the admiration of every heart!--How can she bear
poverty? She has been brought up in all the refinements of opulence
* * *"

I saw his grief was eloquent, and I let it have its flow; for sorrow
relieves itself by words. When his paroxysm had subsided, and he had
relapsed into moody silence, I resumed the subject gently, and urged him
to break his situation at once to his wife. He shook his head
mournfully, but positively.

"But how are you to keep it from her? It is necessary she should know
it, that you may take the steps proper to the alteration of your
circumstances. You must change your style of living--nay," observing a
pang to pass across his countenance, "don't let that afflict you. I am
sure you never placed your happiness in outward show--you have yet
friends, warm friends, who will not think the worse of you for being
less splendidly lodged; and surely it does not require a palace to be
happy with Mary--" "I could be happy with her," cried he convulsively,
"in a hovel! *"

"Believe me, my friend," said I, stepping up, and grasping him warmly by
the hand, "she can be the same with you. Ay, more: it will be a source
of pride and triumph to her--it will call forth all the latent energies
and fervent sympathies of her nature; for she will rejoice to prove that
she loves you for yourself. There is in every true woman's heart a spark
of heavenly fire, which lies dormant in the broad daylight of
prosperity; but which kindles up, and beams and blazes in the dark hour
of adversity." I finished by persuading him to go home and unburden his
sad heart to his wife.

I must confess, notwithstanding all I have said, I felt some little
solicitude for the result. Who can calculate on the fortitude of one
whose whole life has been a round of pleasures? Her gay spirits might
revolt at the dark downward path of low humility, suddenly pointed out
before her, and might cling to the sunny regions in which they had
hitherto reveled.

In short, I could not meet Leslie next morning without trepidation. He
had made the disclosure.

"And how did she bear it?"

"Like an Angel! It seemed rather to be a relief to her mind, for she
threw her arms around my neck, and asked if this was all that had lately
made me unhappy."

Some days afterwards, he called upon me in the evening. He had disposed
of his dwelling-house, and taken a small cottage in the country, a few
miles from town. He had been busy all day in sending out furniture. The
new establishment required few articles, and those of the simplest kind.
All the splendid furniture of his late residence had been sold,
excepting his wife's harp. That, he said was too closely associated with
the idea of herself; it belonged to the little story of their loves; for
some of the sweetest moments of their courtship were those when he had
leaned over that instrument, and listened to the melting tones of her
voice. I could not but smile at this instance of romantic gallantry in a
doting husband.

He was now going out to the cottage, where his wife had been all day
superintending its arrangement. My feelings had become strongly
interested in the progress of this family story, and as it was a fine
evening, I offered to accompany him.

He was wearied with the fatigues of the day, and as we walked out, fell
into a fit of gloomy musing.

"Poor Mary!" at length broke, with a heavy sigh, from his lips.

"And what of her," asked I, "has anything happened to her?"

"What," said he, darting an impatient glance, "is it nothing to be
reduced to this paltry situation--to be caged in a miserable cottage--to
be obliged to toil almost in the menial concerns of her wretched
habitation?"

"Has she then repined at the change?"

"Repined! she has been nothing but sweetness and good humor. Indeed, she
seems in better spirits than I have ever known her; she has been to me
all love and tenderness and comfort!"

"Admirable girl!" exclaimed I, "You call yourself poor, my friend; you
never were so rich--you never knew the boundless treasures of excellence
you possessed in that woman."

"Oh! but, my friend, if this first meeting at the cottage were over, I
think I could then be comfortable. But this is her first day of real
experience: she has been introduced into an humble dwelling--she has
been employed all day, in arranging its miserable equipments--she has
for the first time known the fatigues of domestic employment--she has
for the first time looked around her on a home destitute of everything
elegant--almost of everything convenient; and may now be sitting down,
exhausted and spiritless, brooding over a prospect of future poverty."

There was a degree of probability in this picture that I could not
gainsay, so we walked on in silence.

After turning from the main road, up a narrow lane, so thickly shaded by
forest trees as to give it a complete air of seclusion, we came in sight
of the cottage. It was humble enough in its appearance for the most
pastoral poet; and yet it had a most pleasing rural look. * * * * * Just
as we approached we heard the sound of music--Leslie grasped my arm; we
paused and listened. It was Mary's voice singing, in a style of the most
touching simplicity, a little Scotch air of which her husband was
peculiarly fond.

I felt Leslie's hand tremble on my arm. He stepped forward to hear more
distinctly. His step made a noise on the gravel walk. A bright beautiful
face glanced out at the window and vanished--a light footstep was
heard--and Mary came tripping forth to meet us. She was in a pretty
rural dress of white; a few wild flowers were twisted in her fine hair;
a fresh bloom was on her cheek; her whole countenance beamed with
smiles--I had never seen her look so lovely.

"My dear George," cried she, "I am so glad you are come; I have been
watching and watching for you; and running down the lane and looking out
for you. I've set out a table under a beautiful tree behind the cottage;
and I've been gathering some of the most delicious strawberries, for I
know you are so fond of them--and we have such excellent cream--and
everything is so sweet and still here.--Oh!" said she, putting her arm
within his, and looking up brightly in his face, "Oh, we shall be so
happy!"

Poor Leslie was overcome. He caught her to his bosom--he folded his arms
around her--he kissed her again and again--he could not speak for the
tears gushed into his eyes.

He has often assured me that though the world has since gone
prosperously with him, and his life has indeed been a happy one, yet
never has he experienced a moment of more exquisite felicity than the
time when I accompanied him to the little cottage in the country.

the keel of her husband's estate; and if of high parentage, she doth not
so remember what she was by birth, that she forgets what she is
by--match.

followed him, and was laid by his side. Wotton's two lines on the event
have been celebrated as containing a volume in seventeen words:

      To live without him, liked it not, and died."

       Or place my hand in thine,
     Before I let thy future give
       Color and form to mine,
     Before I peril all for thee,
       Question thy soul to-night for me.

     I break all slighter bonds, nor feel
       A shadow of regret:
     Is there one link within the past
       That holds thy spirit yet?
     Or is thy faith as clear and free
       As that which I can pledge to thee?

     Does there within thy dimmest dreams
       A possible future shine,
     Wherein thy life could henceforth breathe,
       Untouched, unshared by mine?
     If so, at any pains or cost,
       Oh, tell me before all is lost.

     Look deeper still. If thou canst feel
       Within thy inmost soul,
     That thou hast kept a portion back,
       While I have staked the whole,--
     Let no false pity spare the blow,
       But in true mercy tell me so.

     Is there within thy heart a need
       That mine cannot fulfil?
     One cord that any other hand
       Could better wake or still?
     Speak now--lest at some future day
       My whole life wither and decay.

                                  --_Adelaide Anne Proctor._

A WOMAN'S NOBLEST STATION.

     Seek to be good, but aim not to be great;
     A woman's noblest station is retreat:
     Her fairest virtues fly from public sight;
     Domestic worth,--that, shuns too strong a light.


2051

     Kindness in women,
         Not their beauteous looks,
                    Shall win my love.

                                            --_Shakespeare._


2052

     Alas! I am but woman, fond and weak
     Without even power my proud, pure love to speak;
     But oh, by all I fail in, love not me
     For what I am, but what I wish to be.


2053

Manners, not jewels, are a woman's ornament.


2054

The woman who really wishes to refuse an aspirant to her hand contents
herself with saying, No. She who explains, wants to be convinced.


2055

                          Her voice was ever soft,
     Gentle and low, an excellent thing in woman.

2056

In Dr. Johnson's opinion, "a woman was well dressed, when, after seeing
her, one could not remember what she had on."


2057

A beautiful woman without fixed principles, may be likened to those fair
but rootless flowers which float in streams, driven by every breeze.


2058

     Where is the man who has the power and skill
     To stem the torrent of a woman's will?
     For if she will, she will, you may depend on't,
     And if she won't, she won't, and there's an end on't.

                                             --_Aaron Hill._

A woman possessing nothing but outward advantages, is like a flower
without fragrance, a tree without fruit.

The happiest women, like the happiest nations, have no history.

2061

Learn above all, how to manage women: their thousand Ahs! and Ohs! so
thousand-fold, can be cured, but how,--I cannot tell.

                                                 --_Goethe._

Pretty women without religion are like flowers without perfume.


2063

     In women we love that which is natural,
     We admire that which is acquired,
     And shun that which is artificial.

TAKE TO THE WOODS.

     If thou art worn and hard beset
     With sorrow that thou wouldst forget;
     If thou wouldst read a lesson that will keep
     Thy heart from fainting and thy soul from sleep,
     Go to the woods and hills!--No tears
     Dim the sweet looks that Nature wears.

                                             --_Longfellow._


2065

How many a day has been damped and darkened by an angry word!


2066

     No word He hath spoken
     Was ever yet broken.

     Many a word at random spoken,
     May soothe or wound a heart that's broken.

                                       --_Sir Walter Scott._


2068

It is as easy to draw back a stone thrown with force from the hand, as
to recall a word once spoken.


2069

The unspoken word never does harm.


2070

For want of a word, lives often drift, and remain apart.


2071

RASH, ANGRY WORDS.

     Rash, angry words, and spoken out of season,
     When passion has usurped the throne of reason,
     Have ruined many. Passion is unjust,
     And for an idle transitory gust
     Of gratified revenge dooms us to pay,
     With long repentance at a later day.

                                        _Theognis, a Greek._

2073

Words are but wind, but writing may rise up in judgment.

Stay longer--are two charming words in a friend's vocabulary.


2075

Fair words gladden many a heart.

To a good listener few words will do.

Hard words break no bones, but they sometimes break hearts.

     My words fly up, my thoughts remain below,
     Words, without thoughts, never to Heaven go.

Words are but pictures of our thoughts.

2084

                                   If word of mine
     Have harmed thee, rashly spoken, let the winds
     Bear all remembrance of it swift away.

There are words which cut like steel.

If you think twice before you speak once, you will speak twice the
better for it.

     Thy words have darted hope into my soul,
     And comfort dawns upon me.

2088

A word and a stone let go, cannot be recalled.


2089

Like a beautiful flower, full of colour, but without perfume, are the
fine, but fruitless words, of him who does not act accordingly.

                                                 --_Buddha._


2090

It would perhaps be well for many of us to have in sight the following
little sentiment when writing letters:--

     Words spoken are light as air;
     Words written are always there.


2091

AN ILL-TEMPERED LETTER.

An ill-tempered letter, once sent, will sometimes embitter a life-time.
We once saw an old gentleman, with a wise, fine head, calm face, and a
most benevolent look, beg of a postmaster to return him a letter which
he had dropped into the box. To do so, as everybody knows, is illegal;
but won over by the old gentleman's importunity, the postmaster
complied, upon full proof, in comparing the writing etc. being given.
Then, with a beaming face, the old gentleman tore the letter into
fragments, and, scattering them to the winds, exclaimed--"Ah! I've
preserved my friend." The fact is, he had written a letter in a state of
irritation, which was probably unjust and hurtful, but which he had
wisely recalled. "Written words remain," is not only a proverb, but a
very grave caution; and hence the advice--never write in anger, or, at
any rate, keep your letter till next morning, when you probably will be
cool and in a better frame of mind.


2092

A good beginning is half the work.

                                              --_Euripides._


2093

     Art little? Do thy little well:
       And for thy comfort know
     The great can do their greatest work
       No better than, just so.

                                                 --_Goethe._


2094

He who is willing to work finds it hard to wait.


2095

Never be ashamed of honest work. It is far better to be a good
blacksmith than a bad lawyer.


2096

YOUTH AND OLD AGE.

Youth is the seed-time, old age the harvest. If we lay nothing up for
old age it will be as related in the fable; namely: A cricket came to
the ant, and said, "Give me something to eat?" The ant asked, "What did
you in the summer?" "I whistled," said the cricket. "Then," said the
ant, "if you whistled in summer while I was working, you may dance in
the winter," and gave her nothing.


2097

We are best known by what we do.

We often hear of people breaking down from over-work, but nine cases out
of ten they are really suffering from worry or anxiety.

                                       --_Sir John Lubbock._


2101

Unless a man works, he cannot find out what he is able to do.


2102

I cannot abide to see men throw away their tools the minute the clock
begins to strike, as if they took no pleasure in their work, and was
afraid o' doing a stroke too much. The very grindstone 'll go on turning
a bit after you loose it.

                                           --_George Eliot._


2103

THE TENT.

     When my bier is borne to the grave
     And its burden is laid in the ground
     Think not that Rumi is there,
     Nor cry, like the mourners around,
     He is gone,--all is over--farewell!
     But go on your ways again,
     And forgetting your own petty loss,
     Remember his infinite gain.
     For, know that this world is a tent,
     And life but a dream in the night,
     Till death plucks the curtain apart
     And awakens the sleeper with light.

                       --_R. H. Stoddard, From the Persian._


2104

The knowledge of the world is only to be acquired in the world, and not
in the closet.

FROM "EVERY DAY CHRISTIAN LIFE."

Shall I tell you what a princess wrote--the Princess Amelia, who was an
aunt of our good Queen Victoria, and who after a long and painful
sickness and trial died at an early age?--

     "Unthinking, idle, wild, and young,
      I laughed and danced, I talked and sung,
      And proud of health, of freedom, vain,
      Dreamt not of sorrow, care, or pain.
      Oh! then, in those bright hours of glee,
      I thought the world was made for me.

      But when the hour of trial came,
      And sickness shook my feeble frame,
      And folly's gay pursuits were o'er,
      And I could sing and dance no more--
      Oh! then, I thought how sad 'twould be,
      Were only this world made for me."

                                     --_F. W. Farrar, D. D._


2106

A man's quarrel with the world, is only a quarrel with himself.


2107

All my theology is reduced to this narrow compass--Jesus Christ came
into this world to save sinners.

                                           --_A. Alexander._


2108

The world does not seem to care for honorable lives as much as it does
for a good bank-account.


2109

He who would enjoy many friends, and live happy in the world, must often
be deaf, dumb, and blind, to its vices and follies.


2110

IMPORTANCE OF ATTENDING PUBLIC WORSHIP.

Said the Rev. W. J. Dawson: "I know in my own heart how soon the spirit
of devoutness fades when from any cause I am deprived of public worship
for any length of time. And when I see a youth to whom religious worship
has been the atmosphere of his childhood, gradually withdrawing himself
from the means of grace, I tremble for him, because I have seen what
that means. I can think of men whom I loved, and who now lead wretched
and degraded lives, and all their misery began when they forsook the
tabernacles of their God."


2111

A soft answer turneth away wrath.

HANDWRITING--NATIONALITY OF.

It is a remarkable fact, that no man can ever get rid of the style of
handwriting peculiar to his country. If he be English, he always writes
in English style; if French, in French style; if German, Italian, or
Spanish, in the style peculiar to his nation. Professor B----
states:--"I am acquainted with a Frenchman, who has passed all his life
in England, who speaks English like one of our own countrymen, and
writes it with ten times the correctness of ninety-nine in a hundred of
us; but yet who cannot, for the life of him, imitate our mode of
writing. I knew a Scotch youth, who was educated entirely in France, and
resided eighteen years in that country, mixing exclusively with French
people, but who, although he had a French writing-master, and, perhaps,
never saw anything but French writing in his life, or rarely, yet wrote
exactly in the Scotch style."

YOUTH.

     How beautiful is youth! How bright it gleams
     With its illusions, aspirations, dreams!
     Book of beginnings, story without end,
     Each maid a heroine, and each man a friend!
     All possibilities are in its hands:
     No danger daunts it, and no foe withstands:
     In its sublime audacity of faith,
     "Be thou removed!" it, to the mountain, saith.


2126

An easy youth, generally means a hard old age.

YOUTH AND AGE.

As I approve of a youth that has something of the old man in him, so I
am no less pleased with an old man that has something of the youth.

2129

YOUTH.

     Happy the youth that finds the bride
     Whose birth is to his own allied,
                   The sweetest joy of life:
     But oh, the crowds of wretched souls
     Fetter'd to minds of different moulds
             And chain'd t' eternal strife!

                                        --_Dr. Isaac Watts._


2130

In youth we feel richer for every new illusion; in maturer years, for
every one we lose.


2131

     What is youth?--a dancing billow,
     Winds behind, and rocks before!

You youngsters nowadays think you're to begin with living well, and

horseback.

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project

copied or distributed:

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
