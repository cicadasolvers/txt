                     PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION


The studies of the trees of North America (exclusive of Mexico) which
have been carried on by the agents and correspondents of the Arboretum
in the sixteen years since the publication of the _Manual of the Trees
of North America_ have increased the knowledge of the subject and made
necessary a new edition of this _Manual_. The explorations of these
sixteen years have added eighty-nine species of trees and many recently
distinguished varieties of formerly imperfectly understood species to
the silva of the United States, and made available much additional
information in regard to the geographical distribution of American
trees. Further studies have made the reduction of seven species of the
first edition to varieties of other species seem desirable; and two
species, _Amelanchier obovalis_ and _Cercocarpus parvifolius_, which
were formerly considered trees, but are more properly shrubs, are
omitted. The genus Anamomis is now united with Eugenia; and the Arizona
_Pinus strobiformis_ Sarg. (not Engelm.) is now referred to _Pinus
flexilis_ James.

Representatives of four Families and sixteen Genera which did not appear
in the first edition are described in the new edition in which will be
found an account of seven hundred and seventeen species of trees in one
hundred and eighty-five genera, illustrated by seven hundred and
eighty-three figures, or one hundred and forty-one figures in addition
to those which appeared in the first edition.

An International Congress of Botanists which assembled in Vienna in
1905, and again in Brussels in 1910, adopted rules of nomenclature which
the world, with a few American exceptions, has now generally adopted.
The names used in this new _Manual_ are based on the rules of this
International Congress. These are the names used by the largest number
of the students of plants, and it is unfortunate that the confusion in
the names of American trees must continue as long as the Department of
Agriculture, including the Forest Service of the United States, uses
another and now generally unrecognized system.

The new illustrations in this edition are partly from drawings made by
Charles Edward Faxon, who died before his work was finished; it was
continued by the skillful pencil of Mary W. Gill, of Washington, to whom
I am grateful for her intelligent cooperation.

It is impossible to name here all the men and women who have in the last
sixteen years contributed to this account of American trees, and I will
now only mention Mr. T. G. Harbison and Mr. E. J. Palmer, who as agents
of the Arboretum have studied for years the trees of the Southeastern
States and of the Missouri-Texas region, Professor R. S. Cocks, of
Tulane University, who has explored carefully and critically the forests
of Louisiana, and Miss Alice Eastwood, head of the Botanical Department
of the California Academy of Sciences, who has made special journeys in
Alaska and New Mexico in the interest of this _Manual_. Mr. Alfred
Rehder, Curator of the Herbarium of the Arboretum, has added to the
knowledge of our trees in several Southern journeys; and to him I am
specially indebted for assistance and advice in the preparation of the
keys to the different groups of plants found in this volume.

This new edition of the _Manual_ contains the results of forty-four
years of my continuous study of the trees of North America carried on in
every part of the United States and in many foreign countries. If these
studies in any way serve to increase the knowledge and the love of trees
I shall feel that these years have not been misspent.

                                PREFACE


In this volume I have tried to bring into convenient form for the use of
students the information concerning the trees of North America which has
been gathered at the Arnold Arboretum during the last thirty years and
has been largely elaborated in my _Silva of North America_.

The indigenous trees of no other region of equal extent are, perhaps, so
well known as those that grow naturally in North America. There is,
however, still much to be learned about them. In the southern states,
one of the most remarkable extratropical regions in the world in the
richness of its arborescent flora, several species are still imperfectly
known, while it is not improbable that a few may have escaped entirely
the notice of botanists; and in the northern states are several forms of
Crataegus which, in the absence of sufficient information, it has been
found impracticable to include in this volume. Little is known as yet of
the silvicultural value and requirements of North American trees, or of
the diseases that affect them; and one of the objects of this volume is
to stimulate further investigation of their characters and needs.

The arrangement of families and genera adopted in this volume is that of
Engler & Prantl's _Die Natuerlichen Pflanzenfamilien_, in which the
procession is from a simpler to a more complex structure. The
nomenclature is that of _The Silva of North America_. Descriptions of a
few species of Crataegus are now first published, and investigations made
since the publication of the last volume of _The Silva of North
America_, in December, 1902, have necessitated the introduction of a few
additional trees described by other authors, and occasional changes of
names.

An analytical key to the families, based on the arrangement and
character of the leaves, will lead the reader first to the family to
which any tree belongs; a conspectus of the genera, embodying the
important and easily discovered contrasting characters of each genus and
following the description of each family represented by more than one
genus, will lead him to the genus he is trying to determine; and a
similar conspectus of the species, following the description of the
genus, will finally bring him to the species for which he is looking.
Further to facilitate the determination, one or more letters, attached
to the name of the species in the conspectus following the description
of the genus, indicate in which of the eight regions into which the
country is divided according to the prevailing character of the
arborescent vegetation that species grows (see map forming frontispiece
of the volume). For example, the northeastern part of the country,
including the high Appalachian Mountains in the southern states which
have chiefly a northern flora, is represented by (A), and a person
wishing to learn the name of a Pine-tree or of an Oak in that region
need occupy himself only with those species which in the conspectus of
the genus Quercus or Pinus are followed by the letter (A), while a
person wishing to determine an Oak or a Pine-tree in Oregon or
California may pass over all species which are not followed by (G), the
letter which represents the Pacific coast region south of the state of
Washington.

The sign of degrees ( deg.) is used in this work to represent feet, and the
sign of minutes (') inches.

The illustrations which accompany each species and important variety are
one half the size of nature, except in the case of a few of the large
Pine cones, the flowers of some of the Magnolias, and the leaves and
flower-clusters of the Palms. These are represented as less than half
the size of nature in order to make the illustrations of uniform size.
These illustrations are from drawings by Mr. Faxon, in which he has
shown his usual skill and experience as a botanical draftsman in
bringing out the most important characters of each species, and in them
will be found the chief value of this Manual. For aid in its preparation
I am indebted to him and to my other associates, Mr. Alfred Rehder and
Mr. George R. Shaw, who have helped me in compiling the most difficult
of the keys.

                         1. PINUS Duham. Pine.


Trees or rarely shrubs, with deeply furrowed and sometimes laminate or
with thin and scaly bark, hard or often soft heartwood often
conspicuously marked by dark bands of summer cells impregnated with
resin, pale nearly white sapwood, and large branch-buds formed during
summer and composed of minute buds in the axils of bud-scales, becoming
the bracts of the spring shoot. Leaves needle-shaped, clustered, the
clusters borne on deciduous spurs in the axils of scale-like primary
leaves, inclosed in the bud by numerous scales lengthening and forming a
more or less persistent sheath at the base of each cluster. Male flowers
clustered at the base of leafy growing shoots of the year, each flower
surrounded at the base by an involucre of 3--6 scale-like bracts,
composed of numerous sessile anthers, imbricated in many ranks and
surmounted by crest-like nearly orbicular connectives; the female
subterminal or lateral, their scales in the axils of non-accrescent
bracts. Fruit a woody cone maturing at the end of the second or rarely
of the third season, composed of the hardened and woody scales of the
flower more or less thickened on the exposed surface (the _apophysis_),
with the ends of the growth of the previous year appearing as terminal
or dorsal brown protuberances or scars (the _umbo_). Seeds usually
obovoid, shorter or longer than their wings or rarely wingless; outer
seed-coat crustaceous or thick, hard, and bony, the inner membranaceous;
cotyledons 3--18, usually much shorter than the inferior radicle.

Pinus is widely distributed through the northern hemisphere from the
Arctic Circle to the West Indies, the mountains of Central America, the
Canary Islands, northern Africa, the Philippine Islands, and Sumatra.
About sixty-six species are recognized. Of exotic species the so-called
Scotch Pine, _Pinus sylvestris_ L., of Europe and Asia, the Swiss Stone
Pine, _Pinus cembra_ L., and the Austrian Pine and other forms of _Pinus
nigra_ Arnold, from central and southern Europe, are often planted in
the northeastern states, and _Pinus Pinaster_ Ait., of the coast region
of western France and the Mediterranean Basin is successfully cultivated
in central and southern California. _Pinus_ is the classical name of the
Pine-tree.

12 deg. in diameter, a flat-topped crown frequently 60 deg. or 70 deg. across of
comparatively slender branches sweeping outward and downward in graceful
curves, and stout branchlets coated at first with pale or rufous
pubescence, dark orange-brown during their first winter, becoming dark
purple-brown. Bark on young stems and branches thin, smooth, dark green,
becoming on old trunks 2'--3' thick and deeply and irregularly divided
into long thick plate-like ridges covered with large loose rich
purple-brown or cinnamon-red scales. Wood light, soft, straight-grained,
light red-brown; largely manufactured into lumber and used for the
interior finish of buildings, woodwork, and shingles. A sweet sugar-like
substance exudes from wounds made in the heartwood.

Distribution. Mountain slopes and the sides of ravines and canyons;
western Oregon from the valley of the north branch of the Santiam River
southward on the Cascade and coast ranges; California along the northern
and coast ranges to Sonoma County; along the western slopes of the
Sierra Nevada, where it grows to its greatest size at elevations between
3000 deg. and 7000 deg.; reappearing on the Santa Lucia Mountains of the coast
ranges; and on the high mountains in the southwestern part of the state
from Santa Barbara County southward usually at elevations of
5000 deg.--7000 deg. above the sea; and on the San Pedro Martir Mountains in
Lower California.

Occasionally planted as an ornamental tree in western Europe and in the
eastern states, the Sugar Pine has grown slowly in cultivation and shows
little promise of attaining the large size and great beauty which
distinguish it in its native forests.

the base, thin scaly bark, soft pale wood containing numerous
resin-canals, slender whorled twice or thrice ramified branches, their
ultimate divisions stout, glabrous or pubescent, and leaf-buds usually
in 3's, the 2 lateral in the axils of upper leaves. Leaves linear,
spirally disposed, extending out from the branch on all sides or
occasionally appearing 2-ranked by the twisting of those on its lower
side, mostly pointing to the end of the branch, entire, articulate on
prominent persistent rhomboid ultimately woody bases, keeled above and
below, 4-sided and stomatiferous on the 4 sides, or flattened and
stomatiferous on the upper and occasionally on the lower side,
persistent from seven to ten years, deciduous in drying. Flowers
terminal or in the axils of upper leaves, the male usually long-stalked,
composed of numerous spirally arranged anthers with connectives produced
into broad nearly circular toothed crests, the female oblong, oval or
cylindric, with rounded or pointed scales, each in the axis of an
accrescent bract shorter than the scale at maturity. Fruit an ovoid or
oblong, cylindric pendant cone, crowded on the upper branches or in some
species scattered over the upper half of the tree. Seeds ovoid or
oblong, usually acute at base, much shorter than their wings; outer
seed-coat crustaceous, light or dark brown, the inner membranaceous,
pale chestnut-brown; cotyledons 4--15.

Picea is widely distributed through the colder and temperate regions of
the northern hemisphere, some species forming great forests on plains
and high mountain slopes. Thirty-seven species are now recognized,
ranging from the Arctic Circle to the slopes of the southern Appalachian
Mountains and to those of northern New Mexico and Arizona in the New
World, and to central and southeastern Europe, the Caucasus, the
Himalayas, western China, Formosa and Japan. Of exotic species the
so-called Norway Spruce, _Picea Abies_ Karst., one of the most valuable
timber-trees of Europe, has been largely planted for ornament and
shelter in the eastern states, where the Caucasian _Picea orientalis_
Carr., and some of the Japanese species also flourish.

_Picea_ was probably the classical name of the Spruce-tree.

                1. Picea mariana B. S. P. Black Spruce.

[Illustration: Fig. 39]

Leaves slightly incurved above the middle, abruptly contracted at apex
into short callous tips, pale blue-green and glaucous at maturity,
1/4'--3/4' long, hoary on the upper surface from the broad bands of
stomata, and lustrous and slightly stomatiferous on the lower surface.
Flowers: male subglobose, with dark red anthers; female
oblong-cylindric, with obovate purple scales rounded above, and oblong
purple glaucous bracts rounded and denticulate at apex. Fruit ovoid,
pointed, gradually narrowed at the base into short strongly incurved
stalks, 1/2'--1-1/2' long, with rigid puberulous scales rounded or
rarely somewhat pointed at apex and more or less erose on the notched
pale margins, turning as they ripen dull gray-brown and becoming as the
scales gradually open and slowly discharge their seeds almost globose;
sometimes remaining on the branches for twenty or thirty years, the
oldest close to the base of the branches near the trunk; seeds oblong,
narrowed to the acute base, about 1/8' long, very dark brown, with
delicate pale brown wings broadest above the middle, very oblique at the
apex, about 1/2' long, 1/8' wide.

A tree, usually 20 deg.--30 deg. and occasionally 100 deg. high, with a trunk
6'--12' and rarely 3 deg. in diameter, and comparatively short branches
generally pendulous with upward curves, forming an open irregular crown,
light green branchlets coated with pale pubescence, soon beginning to
grow darker, and during their first winter light cinnamon-brown and
covered with short rusty pubescence, their thin brown bark gradually
becoming glabrous and beginning to break into small thin scales during
their second year; at the extreme north sometimes cone-bearing when only
2 deg.--3 deg. high. Winter-buds ovoid, acute, light reddish brown, puberulous,
about 1/8' long. Bark 1/4'--1/2' thick and broken on the surface into
thin rather closely appressed gray-brown scales. Wood light, soft, not
strong, pale yellow-white, with thin sapwood; probably rarely used
outside of Manitoba and Saskatchewan, except in the manufacture of paper
pulp. Spruce-gum, the resinous exudations of the Spruce-trees of
northeastern America, is gathered in considerable quantities principally
in northern New England and Canada, and is used as a masticatory.
Spruce-beer is made by boiling the branches of the Black and Red
Spruces.

Distribution. At the north on well-drained bottom-lands and the slopes
of barren stony hills, and southward in sphagnum-covered bogs, swamps,
and on their borders, from Labrador to the valley of the Mackenzie River
in about latitude 65 deg. north, and, crossing the Rocky Mountains, through
the interior of Alaska to the valley of White River; southward through
Newfoundland, the maritime provinces, eastern Canada and the
northeastern United States to central Pennsylvania, and along the
Alleghany Mountains to northern Virginia; and from the eastern foothills
of the Rocky Mountains in Alberta, through northern Saskatchewan and
northern Manitoba, and south to northeastern and northern Minnesota, and
central Wisconsin and Michigan; very abundant at the far north and the
largest coniferous tree of Saskatchewan and northern Manitoba, covering
here large areas and growing to its largest size; common in Newfoundland
and all the provinces of eastern Canada except southern Ontario; in the
United States less abundant, of small size, and usually only in cold
sphagnum swamps (var. _brevifolia_ Rehd.)

Occasionally planted as an ornamental tree, the Black Spruce is
short-lived in cultivation and one of the least desirable of all
Spruce-trees for the decoration of parks and gardens.

ground, forming a narrow rather conical head, or soon disappearing below
from trees crowded in the forest, stout pubescent light green
branchlets, becoming bright reddish brown or orange-brown during their
first winter, glabrous the following year, and covered in their third or
fourth year with scaly bark. Winter-buds ovoid, acute, 1/4'--1/3' long,
with light reddish brown scales. Bark 1/4'--1/2' thick, and broken into
thin closely appressed irregularly shaped red-brown scales. Wood light,
soft, close-grained, not strong, pale slightly tinged with red, with
paler sapwood usually about 2' thick; largely manufactured into lumber
in the northeastern states, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, and used for the
flooring and construction of houses, for the sounding-boards of musical
instruments, and in the manufacture of paper-pulp.

Distribution. Well-drained uplands and mountain slopes, often forming a
large part of extensive forests, from Prince Edward Island and the
valley of the St. Lawrence southward to the coast of Massachusetts,

thick branches densely clothed with stout rigid laterals sweeping out in
graceful upward curves, and forming a broad-based rather open pyramid
often obtuse at the apex, stout glabrous branchlets orange-brown during
their first autumn and winter, gradually growing darker grayish brown.
Winter-buds broadly ovoid, obtuse, covered by light chestnut-brown
scales with thin often reflexed ciliate margins. Bark 1/4'--1/2' thick,
separating irregularly into thin plate-like light gray scales more or
less tinged with brown. Wood light, soft, not strong, straight-grained
light yellow, with hardly distinguishable sapwood; manufactured into
lumber in the eastern provinces of Canada and in Alaska, and used in
construction, for the interior finish of buildings, and for paper-pulp.

Distribution. Banks and borders of streams and lakes, ocean cliffs, and
in the north the rocky slopes of low hills, from Labrador along the
northern frontier of the forest nearly to the shores of the Arctic Sea,
reaching Behring Strait in 66 deg. 44' north latitude, and southward down
the Atlantic coast to southern Maine, northern New Hampshire, Vermont,
and New York, shores of Saginaw Bay, Michigan, northern Wisconsin and
Minnesota, and through the interior of Alaska.

The variety (var. _albertiana_ Sarg.) of the Gaspe Peninsula and the
valleys of the Black Hills of South Dakota and of the Rocky Mountains of
northern Wyoming, Montana, Alberta and northward, is a tree with a
narrow pyramidal head, sometimes 150 deg. high, with a trunk 3 deg. to 4 deg. in
diameter, and shorter and rather broader cones than those of the typical
White Spruce of the east, although not shorter or as short as the cones
of that tree in the extreme north.

Often planted in Canada, northern New England, and northern Europe as an
ornamental tree; in southern New England and southward suffering from
heat and dryness.

[Illustration: Fig. 46]

Leaves, rounded and rarely emarginate at apex, dark yellow-green,
lustrous and obscurely grooved especially toward the base on the upper
surface, marked on the lower surface by 5 or 6 rows of stomata on each
side of the low broad midrib, 1/3'--2/3' long, about 1/16' wide,
deciduous in their third season from dark orange-colored persistent
bases. Flowers: male light yellow; female pale green, with broad bracts
coarsely laciniate on the margins and shorter than their scales. Fruit
on slender puberulous stalks often 1/4' long, ovoid, acute, 1/2'--3/4'
long, with broad-obovate scales almost as wide as long, and broad
truncate bracts slightly laciniate on the margins, opening and gradually
losing their seeds during the winter and mostly persistent on the
branches until the following spring; seeds 1/16' long, usually with 2 or
3 large oil-vesicles, nearly half as long as their wings broad at the
base and gradually tapering to the rounded apex.

A tree, usually 60 deg.--70 deg., and occasionally 100 deg. high, with a trunk
2 deg.--4 deg. in diameter, gradually and conspicuously tapering toward the
apex, long slender horizontal or pendulous branches, persistent until
overshadowed by other trees, and forming a broad-based rather obtuse
pyramid, and slender light yellow-brown pubescent branchlets, growing
darker during their first winter and glabrous and dark red-brown tinged
with purple in their third season. Winter-buds obtuse, light
chestnut-brown, slightly puberulous, about 1/16' long. Bark 1/2'--3/4'
thick, deeply divided into narrow rounded ridges covered with thick
closely appressed scales varying from cinnamon-red to gray more or less
tinged with purple. Wood light, soft, not strong, brittle,
coarse-grained, difficult to work, liable to wind-shake and splinter,
not durable when exposed to the air, light brown tinged with red, with
thin somewhat darker sapwood; largely manufactured into coarse lumber
employed for the outside finish of buildings. The astringent inner bark
affords the largest part of the material used in the northeastern states
and Canada in tanning leather. From the young branches oil of hemlock is
distilled.

Distribution. Scattered through upland forests and often covering the
northern slopes of rocky ridges and the steep rocky banks of narrow
river-gorges from Nova Scotia to eastern Minnesota (Carleton County),
and southward through the northern states to Newcastle County, Delaware,
cliffs of Tuckahoe Creek, Queen Anne's County, Maryland, southern
Michigan, southern Indiana (bank of Back Creek near Leesville, Laurence
County), southwestern Wisconsin, and along the Appalachian Mountains to
northern Georgia, and in northern Alabama; most abundant and frequently
an important element of the forest in New England, northern New York,
and western Pennsylvania; attaining its largest size near streams on the
slopes of the high mountains of North Carolina and Tennessee.

Largely cultivated with numerous seminal varieties as an ornamental tree
in the northern states, and in western and central Europe.

during their fifth year. Flowers: male tinged with purple; female
purple, with broadly ovate bracts, scarious and erose on the margins and
about as long as their scales. Fruit on short stout stalks, oblong,
1'--1-1/2' long, with narrow-oval scales gradually narrowed and rounded
at apex, rather abruptly contracted at base into distinct stipes, thin,
concave, puberulous on the outer surface, twice as long as their broad
pale bracts, spreading nearly at right angles to the axis of the cone at
maturity, their bracts rather longer than wide, wedge-shaped, pale,
nearly truncate or slightly pointed at the broad apex; seeds 1/6' long,
with numerous small oil-vesicles on the lower side, and one quarter as
long as the pale lustrous wings broad or narrow at the base and narrowed
to the rounded apex.

A tree, usually 40 deg.--50 deg., or occasionally 70 deg. high, with a trunk rarely
exceeding 2 deg. in diameter, short stout often pendulous branches forming a
handsome compact pyramidal head, and slender light orange-brown
pubescent branchlets, usually becoming glabrous and dull brown more or
less tinged with orange during their third year. Winter-buds obtuse,
dark chestnut-brown, pubescent, nearly 1/8' long. Bark of the trunk
3/4'--1-1/4' thick, red-brown, and deeply divided into broad flat
connected ridges covered with thin closely appressed plate-like scales.
Wood light, soft, not strong, brittle, coarse-grained, pale brown tinged
with red, with thin nearly white sapwood.

Distribution. Rocky banks of streams usually at elevations between 2500 deg.
and 3000 deg. on the Blue Ridge from southwestern Virginia to northern
Georgia, generally singly or in small scattered groves of a few
individuals.

Occasionally planted as an ornamental tree in the northern states, and
in western Europe.

[Illustration: Fig. 48]

Leaves rounded at apex, conspicuously grooved, dark green and very
lustrous on the upper surface, marked below by broad white bands of 7--9
rows of stomata, abruptly contracted at the base into slender petioles,
1/4'--3/4' long and 1/16'--1/12' wide, mostly persistent 4--7 years.
Flowers: male yellow; female purple and puberulous, with broad bracts
gradually narrowed to an obtuse point and shorter than their broadly
ovate slightly scarious scales. Fruit oblong-ovoid, acute, sessile,
3/4'--1' long, with slightly puberulous oval scales, often abruptly
narrowed near the middle, and dark purple puberulous bracts rounded and
abruptly contracted at apex; seeds 1/8' long, furnished with occasional
oil-vesicles, one third to one half as long as their narrow wings.

A tree, frequently 200 deg. high, with a tall trunk 6 deg.--10 deg. in diameter, and
short slender usually pendulous branches forming a narrow pyramidal
head, and slender pale yellow-brown branchlets ultimately becoming dark
reddish brown, coated at first with long pale hairs, and pubescent or
puberulous for five or six years. Winter-buds ovoid, bright
chestnut-brown, about 1/16' long. Bark on young trunks thin, dark
orange-brown, and separated by shallow fissures into narrow flat plates
broken into delicate scales, becoming on fully grown trees 1'--1-1/2'
thick and deeply divided into broad flat connected ridges covered with
closely appressed brown scales more or less tinged with cinnamon-red.
Wood light, hard and tough, pale brown tinged with yellow, with thin
nearly white sapwood; stronger and more durable than the wood of the
other American hemlocks; now largely manufactured into lumber used
principally in the construction of buildings. The bark is used in large
quantities in tanning leather; from the inner bark the Indians of Alaska
obtain one of their principal articles of vegetable food.

Distribution. Southeastern Alaska, southward near the coast to southern
Mendocino County, California, extending eastward over the mountains of
southern British Columbia, northern Washington, Idaho and Montana, to
the western slopes of the continental divide, and through Oregon to the
western slopes of the Cascade Mountains, sometimes ascending in the
interior to elevations of 6000 deg. above the sea; most abundant and of its
largest size on the coast of Washington and Oregon; often forming a
large part of the forests of the northwest coast.

Frequently planted as an ornamental tree in temperate Europe.

middle to the wedge-shaped base, rounded at the slightly thickened more
or less erose margins, puberulous on the outer surface, usually bright
bluish purple or occasionally pale yellow-green, four or five times as
long as their short-pointed dark purple or brown bracts; seeds light
brown, 1/8' long, often marked on the surface next their scales with 1
or 2 large resin-vesicles, with wings nearly 1/2' long, broadest above
the middle, gradually narrowed below, slightly or not at all oblique at
the rounded apex.

A tree, usually 70 deg.--100 deg. but occasionally 150 deg. high, with a slightly
tapering trunk 4 deg.--5 deg. in diameter, gracefully pendant slender branches
furnished with drooping frond-like lateral branches, their ultimate
divisions erect and forming an open pyramid surmounted by the long
drooping leading shoot, and thin flexible or sometimes stout rigid
branchlets light reddish brown and covered for two or three years with
short pale dense pubescence, becoming grayish brown and very scaly.
Winter-buds acute, about 1/8' long, the scales of the outer ranks
furnished on the back with conspicuous midribs produced into slender
deciduous awl-like tips. Bark 1'--1-1/2' thick, deeply divided into

cinnamon scales shaded with blue or purple. Wood light, soft, not
strong, close-grained, pale brown or red, with thin nearly white
sapwood; occasionally manufactured into lumber.

Distribution. Exposed ridges and slopes at high altitudes along the
upper border of the forest from southeastern Alaska, southward over the
mountain ranges of British Columbia to the Olympic Mountains of
Washington, and eastward to the western slopes of the Selkirk Mountains
in the interior of southern British Columbia, and along the Bitter Root
Mountains to the headwaters of the Clearwater River, Idaho; along the
Cascade Mountains of Washington and Oregon, on the mountain ranges of
northern California, and along the high Sierra Nevada to the canyon of
the south fork of King's River, California; in Alaska occasionally
descending to the sea-level, and toward the southern limits of its range
often ascending to elevations of 10,000 deg.

Often planted as an ornamental tree in western and central Europe, and
rarely in the eastern United States.

Pyramidal trees, with thick deeply furrowed bark, hard strong wood, with
spirally marked wood-cells, slender usually horizontal irregularly
whorled branches clothed with slender spreading lateral branches forming
broad flat-topped masses of foliage, ovoid acute leaf-buds, the lateral
buds in the axils of upper leaves, their inner scales accrescent and
marking the branchlets with ring-like scars. Leaves petiolate, linear,
flat, rounded and obtuse or acuminate at apex, straight or incurved,
grooved on the upper side, marked on the lower side by numerous rows of
stomata on each side of the prominent midrib, spreading nearly at right
angles with the branch. Flowers solitary, the male axillary, scattered
along the branches, oblong-cylindric, with numerous globose anthers,
their connectives terminating in short spurs, the female terminal or in
the axils of upper leaves, composed of spirally arranged ovate rounded
scales much shorter than their acutely 2-lobed bracts, with midribs
produced into elongated slender tips. Fruit an ovoid-oblong acute
pendulous cone maturing in one season, with rounded concave rigid scales
persistent on the axis of the cone after the escape of the seeds, and
becoming dark red-brown, much shorter than the 2-lobed bracts with
midribs ending in rigid woody linear awns, those at the base of the cone
without scales and becoming linear-lanceolate by the gradual suppression
of their lobes. Seeds nearly triangular, full, rounded and dark-colored
on the upper side and pale on the lower side, shorter than their oblong
wings infolding the upper side of the seeds in a dark covering; outer
seed-coat thick and crustaceous, the inner thin and membranaceous;
cotyledons 6--12, much shorter than the inferior radicle.

Pseudotsuga is confined to western North America, southern Japan,
southwestern China and Formosa. Four species are recognized.

_Pseudotsuga_, a barbarous combination of a Greek with a Japanese word,
indicates the relation of these trees with the Hemlocks.

the continent rarely more than 80 deg.--100 deg. high, with a trunk hardly
exceeding 2 deg.--3 deg. in diameter, slender crowded branches densely clothed
with long pendulous lateral branches, forming while the tree is young an
open pyramid, soon deciduous from trees crowded in the forest, often
leaving the trunk naked for two thirds of its length and surmounted by a
comparatively small narrow head sometimes becoming flap-topped by the
lengthening of the upper branches, and slender branchlets pubescent for
three or four years, pale orange color and lustrous during their first
season, becoming bright reddish brown and ultimately dark gray-brown.
Winter-buds ovoid, acute, the terminal bud often 1/4' long and nearly

rounded and irregularly connected ridges separating on the surface into
small thick closely appressed dark red-brown scales. Wood light, red or
yellow, with nearly white sapwood; very variable in density, quality,
and in the thickness of the sapwood; largely manufactured into lumber in
British Columbia, western Washington and Oregon, and used for all kinds
of construction, fuel, railway-ties, and piles; known commercially as
"Oregon pine." The bark is sometimes used in tanning leather.

Distribution. From about latitude 55 deg. north in the Rocky Mountains and
from the head of the Skeena River in the coast range, southward through
all the Rocky Mountain system to the mountains of western Texas,
southern New Mexico and Arizona, and of northern Mexico, and from the
Big Horn and Laramie Ranges in Wyoming and from eastern base of the
Rocky Mountains of Colorado to the Pacific coast, but absent from the
arid mountains in the great basin between the Wahsatch and the Sierra
Nevada ranges and from the mountains of southern California; most
abundant and of its largest size near the sea-level in the coast region
of southern British Columbia and of Washington and Oregon, and on the
western foothills of the Cascade Mountains; ascending on the California
Sierras to elevations of 5500 deg., and on the mountains of Colorado to
between 6000 deg. and 11,000 deg., above the sea.

Often planted for timber and ornament in temperate Europe, and for
ornament in the eastern and northern states, where only the form from
the interior of the continent flourishes. (_P. glauca Mayr._)

cotyledons 4--10, much shorter than the inferior radicle.

Abies is widely distributed in the New World from Labrador and the
valley of the Athabasca River to the mountains of North Carolina, and
from Alaska through the Pacific and Rocky Mountain regions to the
highlands of Guatemala, and in the Old World from Siberia and the
mountains of central Europe to southern Japan, central China, Formosa,
the Himalayas, Asia Minor, and the highlands of northern Africa.
Thirty-three species are now recognized. Several exotic species are
cultivated in the northern and eastern states; of these the best known
and most successful as ornamental trees are _Abies Nordmanniana_, Spach,
of the Caucasus, _Abies cilicica_ Carr., of Asia Minor, _Abies
cephalonica_ Loud., a native of Cephalonia, _Abies Veitchii_ Lindl., and
_Abies homolepis_ S. & Z., of Japan, and _Abies pinsapo_, Boiss., of the
Spanish Sierra Nevada.

Leaves obtusely short-pointed or occasionally slightly emarginate at
apex, dark green and lustrous on the upper surface, marked on the lower
surface by wide bands of 8--12 rows of stomata, 1/2' to nearly 1' long,
about 1/16' wide. Flowers: male yellow tinged with red; female with
scales rounded above, much broader than long and shorter than their
oblong pale yellow-green bracts rounded at the broad apex terminating in
a slender elongated tip. Fruit oblong-ovoid or nearly oval, rounded at
the somewhat narrowed apex, dark purple, puberulous, about 2-1/2' long,
with scales twice as wide as long, at maturity nearly half covered by
their pale yellow-green reflexed bracts; seeds 1/8' long, with dark
lustrous wings much expanded and very oblique at apex.

A tree, usually 30 deg.--40 deg. and rarely 70 deg. high, with a trunk occasionally
2-1/2 deg. in diameter, and rather rigid branches forming an open
symmetrical pyramid and often disappearing early from the lower part of
the trunk, and stout branchlets pubescent for three or four years, pale
yellow-brown during their first season, becoming dark reddish brown
often tinged with purple, and obtuse orange-brown winter-buds. Bark
1/4'--1/2' thick, covered with thin closely appressed bright
cinnamon-red scales, generally becoming gray on old trees. Wood light,
soft, not strong, coarse-grained, pale brown, with nearly white sapwood;
occasionally manufactured into lumber.

Distribution: Appalachian Mountains; Cheat Mountain, near Cheat Bridge,
Randolph County, West Virginia, and from southwestern Virginia to
western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee, often forming forests of
considerable extent at elevations between 4000 deg. and 6000 deg. above the
sea-level.

Occasionally planted in the parks and gardens of the northern states and
of Europe, but short-lived in cultivation and of little value as an
ornamental tree.

the lower surface, with bands of 4--8 rows of stomata, 1/2' long on
cone-bearing branches to 1-1/4' long on the sterile branches of young
trees, straight, acute or acuminate, with short or elongated rigid
callous tips, spreading at nearly right angles to the branch on young
trees and sterile branches, on the upper branches of older trees often
broadest above the middle, rounded or obtusely short-pointed at apex,
occasionally emarginate on branches at the top of the tree. Flowers:
male yellow, more or less deeply tinged with reddish purple; female with
nearly orbicular purple scales much shorter than their oblong-obovate
serrulate pale yellow-green bracts emarginate with a broad apex abruptly
contracted into a long slender recurved tip. Fruit oblong-cylindric,
gradually narrowed to the rounded apex, puberulous, dark rich purple,
2'--4' long, with scales usually longer than broad, generally almost
twice as long; rarely not as long as their bracts, (var. _phanerolepis_
Fern.); seeds about 1/4' long and rather shorter than their light brown
wings.

A tree, 50 deg.--60 deg. high, with a trunk usually 12'--18'; or rarely 30' in
diameter, spreading branches forming a handsome symmetrical
slender-pyramid, the lower branches soon dying from trees crowded in the
forest, and slender branchlets pale yellow-green and coated with fine
pubescence at first, becoming light gray tinged with red, and often when
four or five years old with purple. Winter-buds nearly globose,
1/8'--1/4' in diameter, with lustrous dark orange-green scales. Bark on
old trees often 1/2' thick, rich brown, much broken on the surface into
small plates covered with scales. Wood light, soft, not strong,
coarse-grained, perishable, pale brown streaked with yellow, with thick
lighter colored sapwood; occasionally made into lumber principally used
for packing-cases. From the bark of this tree oil of fir used in the
arts and in medicine is obtained.

Distribution. From the interior of the Labrador peninsula westward to
the shores of Lesser Slave Lake, southward through Newfoundland, the
maritime provinces of Canada, Quebec and Ontario, northern New England,
northern New York, northern Michigan to the shores of Saginaw Bay, and
northern Minnesota and northeastern Iowa, and along the Appalachian
Mountains from western Massachusetts and the Catskills of New York to
the high mountains of southwestern Virginia; common and often forming a
considerable part of the forest on low swampy ground; on well-drained
hillsides sometimes singly in forests of spruce or forming small almost
impenetrable thickets; in northern Wisconsin and vicinity occurs a form
with longer and more crowded leaves and larger cones (var. _macrocarpa_
Kent); near the timber-line on the mountains of New England and New York
reduced to a low almost prostrate shrub.

Sometimes planted in the northern states in the neighborhood of
farmhouses, but usually short-lived and of little value as an ornamental
tree in cultivation; formerly but now rarely cultivated in European
plantations; a dwarf form (var. _hudsonica_ Englm.) growing only a few
inches high and spreading into broad nests is often cultivated.

disposed filaments dilated into ovoid acute subpeltate denticulate
connectives bearing on their inner face 2--5 pendulous globose 2-valved
anther-cells; the female terminal, ovoid or oblong, composed of numerous
spirally imbricated ovate scales abruptly keeled on the back, the keels
produced into short or elongated points closely adnate to the short
ovule-bearing scales rounded above and bearing below their upper margin
in 2 rows 5--7 ovules at first erect, becoming reversed. Fruit an ovoid
or short-oblong pendulous cone maturing during the first or second
season, persistent after the escape of the seeds, its scales formed by
the enlargement of the united flower and ovuliferous scales, becoming
woody, bearing large deciduous resin-glands, gradually enlarged upward
and widening at the apex into a narrow thickened oblong disk
transversely depressed through the middle and sometimes tipped with a
small point. Seeds 5--7 under each scale, oblong-ovoid, compressed;
seed-coat membranaceous, produced into broad thin lateral wings;
cotyledons 4--6, longer than the inferior radicle.

Sequoia, widely scattered with several species over the northern
hemisphere during the cretaceous and tertiary epochs, is now confined to
the coast of Oregon and California and the mountains of California,
where two species exist.

The name of the genus is formed from Sequoiah, the inventor of the
Cherokee alphabet.

Resinous trees, with furrowed scaly bark, light brown durable heartwood,
thin white sapwood, erect ultimately spreading branches, deciduous
usually 2-ranked lateral branchlets, scaly globose buds, and stout
horizontal roots often producing erect woody projections (_knees_).
Leaves spirally disposed, pale and marked with stomata below on both
sides of the obscure midrib, dark green above, linear-lanceolate,
spreading in 2 ranks, or scale-like and appressed on lateral branchlets,
the two forms appearing on the same or on different branches of the same
tree or on separate trees, deciduous. Flowers unisexual, from buds
formed the previous year; male in the axils of scale-like bracts in long
terminal drooping panicles, with 6--8 stamens opposite in 2 ranks, their
filaments abruptly enlarged into broadly ovate peltate yellow
connectives bearing on their inner face in 2 rows 4--9 2-valved
pendulous anther-cells; female scattered near the ends of the branches
of the previous year, subglobose, composed of numerous ovate spirally
arranged long-pointed scales, adnate below to the thickened fleshy
ovuliferous scales bearing at their base 2 erect bottle-shaped ovules.
Fruit a globose or obovoid short-stalked woody cone maturing the first
year and persistent after the escape of the seeds, formed from the
enlargement and union of the flower and ovule-bearing scales abruptly
dilated from slender stipes into irregularly 4-sided disks often
mucronate at maturity, bearing on the inner face, especially on the
stipes, large dark glands filled with blood-red fragrant liquid resin.
Seeds in pairs under each scale, attached laterally to the stipes,
erect, unequally 3-angled; seed-coat light brown and lustrous, thick,
coriaceous or corky, produced into 3 thick unequal lateral wings and
below into a slender elongated point; cotyledons 4--9, shorter than the
superior radicle.

Taxodium, widely distributed through North America and Europe in Miocene
and Pliocene times, is now confined to the southern United States and
Mexico. Two species are distinguished.

The generic name, from {taxos} and {eidos}, indicates a resemblance of
the leaves to those of the Yew-tree.


      1. Taxodium distichum Rich. Bald Cypress. Deciduous Cypress.

[Illustration: Fig. 64]

Leaves on distichously spreading branchlets, apiculate, 1/2'--3/4' long,

white below; or on the form with pendulous compressed branchlets
long-pointed, keeled and stomatiferous below, concave above more or less
spreading at the free apex, about 1/2' long; in the autumn turning with
the branchlets dull orange-brown before falling. Flowers: panicles of
staminate flowers 4'--5' long, 1-1/2'--2' wide, with slender red-brown
stems, obovoid flower-buds nearly 1/8' long, pale silvery-gray during
winter and purple when the flowers expand in the spring. Fruit usually
produced in pairs at the end of the branch or irregularly scattered
along it for several inches, nearly globose or obovoid, rugose, about 1'
in diameter, the scales generally destitute of tips; seeds with wings
nearly 1/4' long, 1/8' wide.

A tree, with a tall lobed gradually tapering trunk, rarely 12 deg. and
generally 4 deg.--5 deg. in diameter above the abruptly enlarged strongly
buttressed usually hollow base, occasionally 150 deg. tall, in youth
pyramidal, with slender branches often becoming elongated and slightly
pendulous, in old age spreading out into a broad low rounded crown often
100 deg. across, and slender branchlets light green when they first appear,
light red-brown and rather lustrous during their first winter, becoming
darker the following year, the lateral branchlets deciduous, 3'--4'
long, spreading at right angles to the branch, or in the form with
acicular leaves pendulous or erect and often 6' long. Bark 1'--2' thick,
light cinnamon-red and divided by shallow fissures into broad flat
ridges separating on the surface into long thin closely appressed
fibrous scales. Wood light, soft, not strong, easily worked, light or
dark brown, sometimes nearly black; largely used for construction,
railway-ties, posts, fences, and in cooperage.

Distribution. River swamps usually submerged during several months of
the year, low wet banks of streams, and the wet depressions of
Pine-barrens from southern New Jersey and southern Delaware southward
generally near the coast to the Everglade Keys, southern Florida, and
through the Gulf-coast region to the valley of Devil River, Texas,
through Louisiana to southern Oklahoma, through southern and western
Arkansas to southeastern Missouri, and through western and northern
Mississippi to Tishomingo County, and in western Tennessee and Kentucky
to southern Illinois and southwestern Indiana; most common and of its
largest size in the south Atlantic and Gulf states, often covering with
nearly pure forests great river swamps. From the coast of North Carolina
to southern Florida, southern Alabama and eastern and western Louisiana
the form with acicular leaves (_Taxodium distichum_ var. _imbricarium_,
Sarg.) is not rare as a small tree in Pine-barren ponds and swamps.

Often cultivated as an ornamental tree in the northern United States,
and in the countries of temperate Europe, especially the var.
_imbricarium_ (as _Glyptostrobus sinensis_ Hort. not Endl.).

Tall resinous aromatic trees, with scaly bark, spreading branches,
flattened branchlets disposed in one horizontal plane and forming an
open 2-ranked spray and often ultimately deciduous, straight-grained
durable fragrant wood, and naked buds. Leaves scale-like, in 4 ranks, on
leading shoots nearly equally decussate, closely compressed or
spreading, dying and becoming woody before falling, on lateral flattened
branchlets much compressed, conspicuously keeled, and nearly covering
those of the other ranks; on seedling plants linear-lanceolate and
spreading. Flowers monoecious, solitary, terminal, the two sexes on
different branchlets; male oblong, with 12--16 decussate filaments
dilated into broad connectives usually bearing 4 subglobose
anther-cells; female oblong, subtended at base by several pairs of
leaf-like scales slightly enlarged and persistent under the fruit,
composed of 6 acuminate short-pointed scales, those of the upper and
middle ranks much larger than those of the lower rank, ovate or oblong,
fertile and bearing at the base of a minute accrescent ovuliferous scale
2 erect ovules. Fruit an oblong cone maturing in one season, with
subcoriaceous scales marked at the apex by the free thickened
mucronulate border of the enlarged flower-scales, those of the lowest
pair ovate, thin, reflexed, much shorter than the oblong thicker scales
of the second pair widely spreading at maturity; those of the third pair
confluent into an erect partition. Seeds in pairs, erect on the base of
the scale; seed-coat membranaceous, of 2 layers, produced into thin
unequal lateral wings, one narrow, the other broad, oblique, nearly as
long as the scale; cotyledons 2, about as long as the superior radicle.

Libocedrus is confined to western North America, western South America,
where it is distributed from Chile to Patagonia, New Zealand, New
Caledonia, New Guinea, Formosa, and southwestern China. Eight species
are distinguished.

_Libocedrus_, from {libas} and _Cedrus_, relates to the resinous
character of these trees.

back, and nearly covering the flattened obscurely glandular-pitted and
abruptly pointed leaves of the inner ranks. Flowers appearing in January
on the ends of short lateral branchlets of the previous year; male
tingeing the tree with gold during the winter and early spring, ovate,
nearly 1/4' long, with nearly orbicular or broadly ovate connectives,
rounded, acute or acuminate at the apex and slightly erose on the
margins; female subtended by 2--6 pairs of leaf-like scales, with ovate
acute light yellow-green slightly spreading scales. Fruit ripening and

slightly and irregularly lobed trunk tapering from a broad base, 3 deg. or
4 deg. or occasionally 6 deg. or 7 deg. in diameter, slender branches erect at the
top of the tree, below sweeping downward in bold curves, forming a
narrow open feathery crown becoming in old age irregular in outline by
the greater development of a few ultimately upright branches forming
secondary stems, and stout branchlets somewhat flattened and light
yellow-green at first, turning light red-brown during the summer and
ultimately brown more or less tinged with purple, the lateral branchlets
much flattened, 4'--6' long, and usually deciduous at the end of the
second or third season. Bark 1/2'--1' thick, bright cinnamon-red, and
broken into irregular ridges covered with closely appressed plate-like
scales. Wood light, soft, close-grained very durable in contact with the
soil, light reddish brown, with thin nearly white sapwood; often injured
by dry rot but largely used for fencing, laths and shingles, the
interior finish of buildings, for furniture, and in the construction of
flumes.

Distribution. Singly or in small groves from the southeastern slope of
Mt. Hood, Oregon, and southward along the Cascade Mountains; on the high
mountains of northern California, on the western slopes of the Sierra
Nevada, and in Alpine County on their eastern slope, on the Washoe
Mountains, western Nevada, in the California coast ranges from the Santa
Lucia Mountains, Monterey County to the high mountains in the southern
part of the state; on the Sierra del Pinal and the San Pedro Martir
Mountains, Lower California; most abundant and of its largest size on
the Sierra Nevada, of central California at elevations of 5000 deg.--7000 deg.
above the sea.

Often cultivated as an ornamental tree in western and central Europe,
where it grows rapidly and promises to attain a large size; hardy and
occasionally planted in the New England and middle Atlantic states.

branchlets disposed in one horizontal plane, forming a flat frond-like
spray and often finally deciduous, and naked buds. Leaves decussate,
scale-like, acute, stomatiferous on the back, on leading shoots
appressed or spreading, rounded or slightly keeled on the back, narrowed
into long slender points, on lateral branchlets much compressed in the
lateral ranks, prominently keeled and nearly covering those of the other
ranks; on seedling plants linear-lanceolate, acuminate, spreading or
reflexed. Flowers minute, monoecious, from buds formed the previous
autumn, terminal, solitary, the two sexes usually on different
branchlets; male ovoid, with 4--6 decussate filaments, enlarged into
suborbicular peltate connectives bearing on their inner face 2--4
subglobose anther-cells; female oblong, with 8--12 oblong acute scales
opposite in pairs, the ovuliferous scales at their base bearing usually
2 erect bottle-shaped ovules. Fruit an ovoid-oblong erect pale
cinnamon-brown cone maturing in one season, its scales thin (thick in
one species), leathery, oblong, acute, marked near the apex by the
thickened free border of the enlarged flower-scales, those of the 2 or 3
middle ranks largest and fertile. Seeds usually 2, erect on the base of
the scale, ovoid, acute, compressed, light chestnut-brown; seed-coat
membranaceous, produced except in one species into broad lateral wings
distinct at the apex; cotyledons 2, longer than the superior radicle.

Thuja is confined to northeastern and northwestern America, to Japan,
Korea and northern China. Five species are recognized. Of the exotic
species the Chinese _Thuja orientalis_, L., with many varieties produced
by cultivation, is frequently planted in the United States, especially
in the south and west, for the decoration of gardens, and is
distinguished from the other species by the thick umbonate scales of the
cone, only the 4 lower scales being fertile, and by the thick rounded
dark red-purple seeds without wings.

_Thuja_ is the classical name of some coniferous tree.

A tree, 50 deg.--60 deg. high, with a short often lobed and buttressed trunk,
occasionally 6 deg. although usually not more than 2 deg.--3 deg. in diameter, often
divided into 2 or 3 stout secondary stems, short horizontal branches
soon turning upward and forming a narrow compact pyramidal head, light
yellow-green branchlets paler on the lower surface than on the upper,
changing with the death of the leaves during their second season to
light cinnamon-red, growing darker the following year, gradually
becoming terete and abruptly enlarged at the base and finally covered
with smooth lustrous dark orange-brown bark, and marked by conspicuous
scars left by the falling of the short pendulous lateral branchlets.
Bark 1/4'--1/3' thick, light red-brown often tinged with orange color
and broken by shallow fissures into narrow flat connected ridges
separating into elongated more or less persistent scales. Wood light,
soft, brittle, very coarse-grained, durable, fragrant, pale
yellow-brown; largely used in Canada and the northern states for
fence-posts, rails, railway-ties, and shingles. Fluid extracts and
tinctures made from the young branchlets are sometimes used in medicine.

Distribution. Frequently forming nearly impenetrable forests on swampy
ground or often occupying the rocky banks of streams, from Nova Scotia
and New Brunswick, northwestward to the mouth of the Saskatchewan, and
southward through eastern Canada to southern New Hampshire, central
Massachusetts, New York, central Ohio, northern Indiana and Illinois,
and Minnesota; occasionally on the high mountains of Virginia, West
Virginia, and northeastern Tennessee, and on the mountains of western
Burke County, North Carolina, at an altitude of 3000 feet; very common
at the north, less abundant and of smaller size southward.

Often cultivated, with many, often dwarf, forms produced in nurseries,
as an ornamental tree and for hedges; and in Europe from the middle of

1/12' long, dark brown. Fruit ripening early in the autumn, clustered
near the ends of the branches, much reflexed, 1/2' long, with thin
leathery scales, conspicuously marked near the apex by the free border
of the flower-scale furnished with short stout erect or recurved dark
mucros; seeds often 3 under each fertile scale, rather shorter than

A tree, frequently 200 deg. high, with a broad gradually tapering buttressed
base sometimes 15 deg. in diameter at the ground and in old age often
separating toward the summit into 2 or 3 erect divisions, short
horizontal branches, usually pendulous at the ends, forming a dense
narrow pyramidal head, and slender much compressed branchlets often
slightly zigzag, light bright yellow-green during their first year, then
cinnamon-brown, and after the falling of the leaves, lustrous and dark
reddish brown often tinged with purple, the lateral branchlets 5'--6'
long, light green and lustrous on the upper surface, somewhat paler on
the lower surface, turning yellow and falling generally at the end of
their second season. Bark bright cinnamon-red, 1/2'--3/4' thick,
irregularly divided by narrow shallow fissures into broad ridges rounded
on the back and broken on the surface into long narrow rather loose
plate-like scales. Wood light, soft, not strong, brittle,
coarse-grained, easily split, dull brown tinged with red; largely used
in Washington and Oregon for the interior finish of buildings, doors,
sashes, fences, shingles, and in cabinet-making and cooperage. From this
tree the Indians of the northwest coast split the planks used in the
construction of their lodges, carved the totems which decorate their
villages, and hollowed out their great war canoes, and from the fibres
of the inner bark made ropes, blankets, and thatch for their cabins.

Distribution. Singly and in small groves on low moist bottom-lands or
near the banks of mountain streams, from the sea-level to elevations of
6000 deg. in the interior, from Baranoff Island, Alaska, southward along the
coast ranges of British Columbia, western Washington, and Oregon, where
it is the most abundant and grows to its largest size, and through the
California-coast region to Mendocino County, ranging eastward along many
of the interior ranges of British Columbia, northern Washington, Idaho,
and Montana to the western slope of the continental divide.

Often cultivated as an ornamental tree in the parks and gardens of
western and central Europe where it has grown rapidly and vigorously,
and occasionally in the middle and north Atlantic states.

pollen-sacs; the female ovoid, surrounded at the base by many minute
scale-like bracts persistent and unchanged under the fruit, composed of
2--6 opposite or ternate pointed scales alternate with or bearing on
their inner face at the base on a minute ovuliferous scale 1 or 2
ovules. Fruit a berry-like succulent fleshy blue, blue-black, or red
strobile formed by the coalition of the flower-scales, inclosed in a
membranaceous skin covered with a glaucous bloom, ripening during the
first, second, or rarely during the third season, smooth or marked by
the ends of the flower-scales, or by the pointed tips of the ovules,
closed, or open at the top and exposing the apex of the seeds. Seeds
1--12, ovoid, acute or obtuse, terete or variously angled, often
longitudinally grooved by depressions caused by the pressure of
resin-cells in the flesh of the fruit, smooth or roughened and
tuberculate, chestnut-brown, marked below by the large conspicuous
usually 2-lobed hilum; seed-coat of 2 layers, the outer thick and bony,
the inner thin, membranaceous or crustaceous; cotyledons 2, or 4--6,
about as long as the superior radicle.

Juniperus is widely scattered over the northern hemisphere from the
Arctic Circle to the highlands of Mexico, Lower California, and the West
Indies in the New World, and to the Azores and Canary Islands, northern
Africa, Abyssinia, the mountains of east tropical Africa, Sikkim,
central China, Formosa, Japan and the Bonin Islands in the Old World.
About thirty-five species are now distinguished. Of the exotic species
cultivated in the United States the most common are European forms of
_Juniperus communis_ L. with fastigiate branches, and dwarf forms of the
European _Juniperus Sabina_ L., and of _Juniperus chinensis_ L.

_Juniperus_ is the classical name of the Juniper.

tinged with red or gray; on exposed cliffs on the coast of Maine,
sometimes only a few inches high with long branches forming broad dense
mats. Bark 1/8'--1/4' thick, light brown tinged with red, and separated
into long narrow scales fringed on the margins, and persistent for many
years. Wood light, close-grained, brittle, not strong, dull red, with
thin nearly white sapwood, very fragrant, easily worked; largely used
for posts, the sills of buildings, the interior finish of houses, the
lining of closets and chests for the preservation of woolens against the
attacks of moths, and largely for pails and other small articles of
wooden ware. A decoction of the fruit and leaves is used in medicine,
and oil of red cedar distilled from the leaves and wood as a perfume.

Distribution. Dry gravelly slopes and rocky ridges, often immediately on
the seacoast, from southern Nova Scotia and New Brunswick to the coast
of Georgia, the interior of southern Alabama and Mississippi, and
westward to the valley of the lower Ottawa River, southern Michigan,
eastern North and South Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas, and eastern Texas,
not ascending the mountains of New England and New York nor the high
southern Alleghanies; in middle Kentucky and Tennessee, and northern
Alabama and Mississippi, covering great areas of low rolling limestone
hills with nearly pure forests of small bushy trees.

Often cultivated, in several forms, in the northern and eastern states
as an ornamental tree and occasionally in the gardens of western and
central Europe.

top of the tree and pendulous below, and pendulous branchlets about
1/24' in diameter, becoming light red-brown or ashy gray at the end of
four or five years after the disappearance of the leaves. Bark thin,
light red-brown, separating into long thin scales. Wood light, close,
straight-grained, fragrant, dull red; formerly exclusively used in the
manufacture of the best lead pencils.

Distribution. Inundated river swamps from southern Georgia, southward to
the shores of the Indian River, Florida, and on the west coast of

Glabrous foetid or pungent aromatic trees, with fissured bark and
verticillate or opposite spreading or drooping branches. Leaves thin,
long-pointed, abruptly contracted at base, dark green, lustrous and
slightly rounded above, thickened and revolute on the margins, with pale
bands of stomata on each side of the midvein on the lower surface.
Flowers dioecious; the male crowded in the axils of adjacent leaves, on
shoots of the previous year, oval or oblong, composed of 6 or 8 close
whorls each of 4 stamens, subverticillately arranged on a slender axis;
filaments stout and expanded above into 4 globose yellow pollen-sacs
united into a half ring, their connectives produced above the cells; the
female on shoots of the year less numerous and scattered, sessile, the
ovule surrounded by and finally inclosed in an ovoid urn-shaped fleshy
sac, and becoming at the end of the second season an oblong-ovate
yellow-brown seed, rounded and apiculate at apex, acute and marked at
base by the large dark hilum; seed-coat thick and woody, its inner layer
folded into the thick white albumen, surrounded and finally inclosed in
the thick green or purple enlarged disk of the flower composed of thin
flat easily separable fibers, splitting longitudinally when ripe into
two parts and separating from the basal scales persistent on the short
stout stalk of the seed.

Torreya is now confined to Florida and Georgia, western California,
Japan, the island of Quelpart, and central and northern China. Four
species are recognized. Of the exotic species the Japanese _Torreya
nucifera_ S. & Z. is occasionally cultivated in the eastern states.

The genus is named in honor of Dr. John Torrey, the distinguished
American botanist.

pendant pollen-sacs peltately connate from the end of a short filament;
the female sessile in the axils of the upper scale-like bracts of a
short axillary branch, the ovule erect, sessile on a ring-like disk,
ripening in the autumn into an ovoid-oblong seed gradually narrowed and
short-pointed at apex, marked at base by the much-depressed hilum, about
1/3' long, entirely or nearly surrounded by but free from the now
thickened succulent translucent sweet scarlet aril-like disk of the
flower open at apex; seed-coat thick, of two layers, the outer thin and
membranaceous or fleshy, the inner much thicker and somewhat woody;
albumen uniform.

Taxus with six or seven species, which can be distinguished only by
their leaf characters and habit, is widely distributed through the
northern hemisphere, and is found in eastern North America where two
species occur, in Pacific North America, Mexico, Europe, northern
Africa, western and southern Asia, China, and Japan. Of the exotic
species the European, African, and Asiatic _Taxus baccata_ L., and its
numerous varieties, is often cultivated in the United States, especially
in the more temperate parts of the country, and is replaced with
advantage by the hardier _Taxus cuspidata_ S. & Z., of eastern Asia in
the northern states, where the native shrubby _Taxus canadensis_ Marsh,
with _monoecious_ flowers is sometimes cultivated.

_Taxus_, from {taxos}, is the classical name of the Yew-tree.

stout columnar style crowned by a large funnel-formed flat or oblique
stigma; ovule basilar, erect. Fruit a globose drupe with juicy bitter
ivory-white flesh easily separable from the thin-shelled tawny brown
nut. Seed free, erect, slightly flattened at the ends, with an oblong
pale conspicuous subbasilar hilum, a short-branched raphe, a thin coat,
and uniform albumen more or less deeply penetrated by a broad basal
cavity; embryo lateral.

Thrinax is confined to the tropics of the New World and is distributed
from southern Florida through the West Indies to the shores of Central
America. Seven or eight species are now generally recognized.

The wood of the Florida species is light and soft, with numerous small
fibro-vascular bundles, the exterior of the stem being much harder than
the spongy interior. The stems are used for the piles of small wharves
and turtle-crawls, and the leaves for thatch, and in making hats,
baskets, and small ropes.

_Thrinax_, from {thrinax}, is in allusion to the shape of the leaves.

trunk often 2 deg. in diameter, sometimes branched by the destruction of the
terminal bud, divided by shallow irregular interrupted fissures into
broad ridges, with a short pointed knob-like underground stem surrounded
by a dense mass of contorted roots often 4 deg. or 5 deg. in diameter and 5 deg. or
6 deg. deep, from which tough light orange-colored roots often nearly 1/2'
in diameter penetrate the soil for a distance of 15 deg. or 20 deg., and a broad

sheaths of young leaves the bristles of scrubbing-brushes are made. The
large succulent leaf-buds are cooked and eaten as a vegetable, and
coarse hats, mats, and baskets are made from the leaves. Pieces of the
spongy bark of the stem are used as a substitute for scrubbing-brushes.

Distribution. Florida, hummocks on Rogue River twenty miles east of
Caximbas Bay, on some of the Everglades Keys, Long's Key, and formerly
on the shores of Bay Biscayne near the mouth of Little River; common in
the West Indies and Central America.

Largely cultivated as an ornamental tree in tropical countries, and
often planted to form avenues, for which its tall pale columnar stems
and noble heads of graceful foliage make it valuable.

                              1. YUCCA L.


Trees with simple or branched stems prolonged by axillary naked buds,
dark thick corky bark, light fibrous wood in concentric layers, and
large stout horizontal roots; or often stemless. Leaves involute in the
bud, at first erect, usually becoming reflexed, abruptly narrowed above
the broad thickened clasping base, usually widest near the middle,
concave on the upper surface, involute toward the horny usually
sharp-pointed apex, convex and often slightly keeled toward the base on
the lower surface, the margins serrulate or filamentose, light or dull
green. Flowers fertilized by insects and opening for a single night, on
slender pedicels in 2 or 3-flowered clusters or singly at the base of
the large compound panicle furnished with conspicuous leathery white or
slightly colored bracts, those at the base of the pedicels thin and
scarious; perianth cup-shaped, with thick ovate-lanceolate creamy white
segments more or less united at base, usually furnished with small tufts
of white hairs at the apex, those of the outer rank narrower, shorter,
and more colored than the more delicate petal-like segments of the inner
rank; stamens 6, in 2 series, free, shorter than the ovary (_as long in_
1), white, with club-shaped fleshy filaments, obtuse and slightly
3-lobed at the apex, and cordate emarginate anthers attached on the
back, the cells opening longitudinally, curling backward and expelling
the large globose powdery pollen-grains; ovary oblong, 6-sided, sessile
or stalked, with nectar-glands within the partitions, dull greenish
white, 3-celled, gradually narrowed into a short or elongated 3-lobed
ivory-white style forming a triangular stigmatic tube. Fruit oblong or
oval, more or less distinctly 6-angled, 6-celled, usually beaked at the
apex, baccate and indehiscent or capsular and 3-valved, the valves
finally separating at the apex; pericarp of 2 coats, the outer at
maturity thick, succulent and juicy, thin, dry and leathery, or thin and
woody. Seeds compressed, triangular, obovoid, or obliquely ovoid or
orbicular, thick, with a narrow 2-edged rim, or thin, with a wide or
narrow brittle margin; seed-coat thin, black, slightly rugose or smooth;
embryo in plain or rarely ruminate hard farinaceous oily albumen;
cotyledon much longer than the short radicle turned toward the small
oblong white hilum.

Yucca is confined to the New World and is distributed from Bermuda and
the eastern Antilles, through the south Atlantic and Gulf states to
Oklahoma and Arkansas, and through New Mexico and northward along the
eastern base of the Rocky Mountains to South Dakota, westward to middle
California, and southward through Arizona, Mexico, and Lower California
to Central America. About thirty species with many varieties and
probable hybrids are recognized. Of the species which inhabit the
territory of the United States nine assume the habit and attain the size
of small trees. The root-stalks of Yucca are used as a substitute for
soap, and ropes, baskets, and mats are made from the tough fibres of the
leaves. Many of the species are cultivated, especially in countries of
scanty rainfall, for their great clusters of beautiful flowers, or in
hedges to protect gardens from cattle.

The generic name is from the Carib name of the root of the Cassava.

thin fibres. Flowers in October, in pubescent or glabrate panicles,
2 deg.--4 deg. long, on stout stalks sometimes 3 deg.--4 deg. in length, their large
creamy white bracts forming before the panicle emerges a conspicuous
egg-shaped bud 4'--6' long; perianth when fully expanded 3-1/2'--4'
across, its segments thin, ovate, acute, or lance-ovate, often tinged
with green or purple, slightly united at the base, pubescent at apex;
stamens about as long as the ovary, with hispid or slightly papillose
filaments and deeply emarginate anthers; ovary slightly lobed, 6-sided,
light green, gradually narrowed into the elongated spreading stigmatic
lobes. Fruit very rarely produced, prominently 6-ridged, pendulous, 3'
long, 1' in diameter, cuspidate, raised on a short stout stipe, with a
thin leathery almost black outer coat; seeds 1/4' wide and about 1/36'
thick, with a smooth coat and a narrow marginal rim.

A tree, with a trunk occasionally 6 deg.--8 deg. high and 4'--6' in diameter,
simple or rarely furnished with a few short branches and usually clothed
to the base with pendant dead leaves; in cultivation often becoming much
larger, with a stout trunk covered with smooth light gray bark, and
erect or in one form (var. _recurvifolia_ Engelm.) pendulous leaves.

the thin base, tapering toward the apex, or sometimes somewhat broadest
at the middle, thin, flat on the upper surface, slightly thickened and
rounded on the lower surface toward the base, smooth, pale yellow-green,
with a slender stiff red-brown tip, and thickened entire pale margins
soon splitting into long slender filaments. Flowers in May and June on
slender spreading more or less recurved pedicels, in glabrous
much-branched panicles 4 deg.--6 deg. long, raised on stout naked stem 3 deg.--7 deg. in
length; perianth ovoid and acute in the bud, when fully expanded
3-1/2'--4' across, its segments united at the base into a short slender
distinct tube, ovate or slightly obovate, those of the outer rank
usually acute, not more than half as broad as those of the inner rank;
stamens as long or a little longer than the ovary, with slender nearly
terete filaments; ovary sessile, almost terete, pale green, abruptly
contracted into the stout elongated style. Fruit an erect oblong capsule
rounded and obtuse at the ends, tipped by a short stout mucro,
conspicuously 3-ribbed, with rounded ridges on the back of the carpels,
1-1/2'--2' long, 1'--1-1/2' wide, with a thin firm light brown ligneous
outer coat closely adherent to the lustrous light yellow inner coat, in
ripening splitting from the top to the bottom between the carpels, and
through their backs at the apex; seeds 1/3' wide and about 1/32' thick,
with a smooth coat and a thin brittle wide margin to the rim.

A tree, with a rough much-branched underground stem penetrating deep
into the soil and a trunk often 15 deg.--20 deg. high and 7'--8' in diameter,
covered above with a thick thatch of the pendant dead leaves of many

densely covered with leaves at first erect, then spreading nearly at
right angles, and finally pendulous. Bark dark brown, irregularly
fissured, broken into thin plates, about 1/4' thick. Wood light, soft,
spongy, pale brown or yellow.

Distribution. High desert plateaus from southwestern Texas to southern
Arizona; southward into northern Mexico; most abundant and of its
largest size on the eastern slope of the continental divide in southern
New Mexico and along the northern rim of the Tucson Desert in Arizona.




                       Division II. Dicotyledons.


Stems formed of bark, wood, or pith, and increasing by the addition of
an annual layer of wood inside the bark. Parts of the flower mostly in
4's and 5's; embryo with a pair of opposite cotyledons. Leaves
netted-veined.

_Subdivision 1._ Apetalae. Flowers without a corolla and sometimes
without a calyx (with a corolla in _Olacaceae_).

Section 1. Flowers in unisexual aments (_female flowers of Juglans and
Quercus solitary or in spikes_); ovary inferior (_superior in

                             V. SALICACEAE.


Trees or shrubs, with watery juice, alternate simple stalked deciduous
leaves with stipules, soft light usually pale wood, astringent bark,
scaly buds, and often stoloniferous roots. Flowers appearing in early
spring usually before the leaves, solitary in the axils of the scales of
unisexual aments from buds in the axils of leaves of the previous year,
the male and female on different plants; perianth 0; stamens 1, 2 or
many, their anthers introrse, 2-celled, the cells opening
longitudinally; styles usually short or none; stigmas 2--4, often
2-lobed. Fruit a 1-celled 2--4-valved capsule, with 2--4 placentas
bearing below their middle numerous ascending anatropous seeds without
albumen and surrounded by tufts of long white silky hairs attached to
the short stalks of the seeds and deciduous with them; embryo straight,
filling the cavity of the seed; cotyledons flattened, much longer than
the short radicle turned toward the minute hilum.

The two genera of this family are widely scattered but most abundant in
the northern hemisphere, with many species, and are often conspicuous
features of vegetation.

                                                               2. Salix.




                         1. POPULUS L. Poplar.


Large fast-growing trees, with pale furrowed bark, terete or angled
branchlets, resinous winter-buds covered by several thin scales, those
of the first pair small and opposite, the others imbricated, increasing
in size from below upward, accrescent and marking the base of the
branchlet with persistent ring-like scars, and thick roots. Leaves
involute in the bud, usually ovate or ovate-lanceolate, entire, dentate
with usually glandular teeth, or lobed, penniveined, turning yellow in
the autumn; petioles long, often laterally compressed, sometimes
furnished at the apex on the upper side with 2 nectariferous glands,
leaving in falling oblong often obcordate, elliptic, arcuate, or
shield-shaped leaf-scars displaying the ends of 3 nearly equidistant
fibro-vascular bundles; stipules caducous, those of the first leaves
resembling the bud-scales, smaller higher on the branch, and
linear-lanceolate and scarious on the last leaves. Flowers in pendulous
stalked aments, the pistillate lengthening and rarely becoming erect
before maturity; scales obovate, gradually narrowed into slender stipes,
dilated and lobed, palmately cleft or fimbriate at apex, membranaceous,
glabrous or villose, more crowded on the staminate than on the
pistillate ament, usually caducous; disk of the flower broadly
cup-shaped, often oblique, entire, dentate or irregularly lobed, fleshy
or membranaceous, stipitate, usually persistent under the fruit; stamens
4--12 or 12--60 or more, inserted on the disk, their filaments free,
short, light yellow; anthers ovoid or oblong, purple or red; ovary
sessile in the bottom of the disk, oblong-conical subglobose or
ovoid-oblong, cylindric or slightly lobed, with 2 or 3 or rarely 4
placentas; styles usually short; stigmas as many as the placentas,
divided into filiform lobes or broad, dilated, 2-parted or lobed. Fruit
ripening before the full growth of the leaves, greenish, reddish brown,
or buff color, oblong-conic, subglobose or ovoid-oblong, separating at
maturity into 2--4 recurved valves. Seeds broadly obovoid or ovoid,
rounded or acute at the apex, light chestnut-brown; cotyledons elliptic.

Populus in the extreme north often forms great forests, and is common on
the alluvial bottom-lands of streams and on high mountain slopes,
ranging from the Arctic Circle to northern Mexico and Lower California
and from the Atlantic to the Pacific in the New World, and to northern
Africa, the southern slopes of the Himalayas, central China, and Japan
in the Old World. Of the thirty-four species now generally recognized
fifteen are found in North America. The wood of many of the American
species is employed in large quantities for paper-making, and several
species furnish wood used in construction and in the manufacture of
small articles of wooden ware. The bark contains tannic acid and is used
in tanning leather and occasionally as a tonic, and the fragrant balsam
contained in the buds of some species is occasionally used in medicine.
The rapidity of their growth, their hardiness and the ease with which
they can be propagated by cuttings, make many of the species useful as
ornamental trees or in wind-breaks, although planted trees often suffer
severely from the attacks of insects boring into the trunks and
branches. Of the exotic species, the Abele, or White Poplar, _Populus
alba_ L., of Europe and western Asia, and its fastigiate form, and the
so-called Lombardy Poplar, a tree of pyramidal habit and a form of the
European and Asiatic _Populus nigra_ L., and one of its hybrids, have
been largely planted in the United States.

_Populus_, of obscure derivation, is the classical name of the Poplar.

Distribution. Low often inundated river-bottom lands and swamp borders;
Labrador to latitude 65 deg. north in the valley of the Mackenzie River, and
to the Alaskan coast, south to northern New England and New York,
central Michigan, Minnesota (except in southern and southwestern
counties), Turtle Mountains, Rolette County, North Dakota, the Black
Hills of South Dakota, northwestern Nebraska (basin of Hat Creek), and
in Colorado; the characteristic tree on the streams of the prairie
region of British America, attaining its greatest size on the islands
and banks of the Peace, Athabasca, and other tributaries of the
Mackenzie; common in all the region near the northern boundary of the
United States from Maine to the western limits of the Atlantic forests;
the largest of the sub-Arctic American trees, and in the far north the
most conspicuous feature of vegetation; passing into the variety
_Michauxii_ Farwell, with more cordate leaves, slightly pilose on the
under side of the midrib and veins; common from Aroostook County, Maine,
to the Province of Quebec, Newfoundland, and the shores of Hudson Bay.

Often planted at the north for shelter or ornament.

_Populus candicans_ Ait., the Balm of Gilead of which only the
pistillate tree is known, has often been considered a variety of the
North American Balsam Poplar. This tree has been long cultivated in the
northeastern part of the country and has sometimes escaped from
cultivation and formed groves of considerable extent, as on the banks of
Cullasagee Creek on the western slope of the Blue Ridge in Macon County,
North Carolina. The fact that only one sex is known suggests hybrid
origin but of obscure and possibly partly of foreign origin.

A tree, sometimes 100 deg. high, with a trunk occasionally 7 deg.--8 deg. in
diameter, divided often 20 deg.--30 deg. above the ground into several massive
limbs spreading gradually and becoming pendulous toward the ends, and
forming a graceful rather open head frequently 100 deg. across, or on young
trees nearly erect above and spreading below almost at right angles with
the stem, and forming a symmetrical pyramidal head, and stout branchlets
marked with long pale lenticels, terete, or, especially on vigorous

Distribution. Banks of streams, often forming extensive open groves, and
toward the western limits of its range occasionally in upland ravines
and on bluffs; Province of Quebec and the shores of Lake Champlain,
through western New England, western New York, Pennsylvania west of the
Allegheny Mountains, and westward to southern Minnesota, North and South
Dakota, eastern Nebraska, eastern Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas, and
southward through the Atlantic states from Delaware to western Florida,
and through the Gulf states to western Texas (Brown County). In the
south Atlantic states and the valley of the Lower Ohio River and
southward sometimes replaced by a variety with leaves covered above when
they unfold with soft white hairs and below with close pubescence more
or less persistent during the season especially on the midribs and veins
(var. _pilosa_ Sarg.).

Often planted for shelter and ornament on the treeless plains and
prairies between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains, and as
an ornamental tree in the eastern United States and largely in western
and northern Europe.

x _Populus canadensis_ Moench, believed to be a hybrid between the
northern glabrous form of _P. balsamifera_ and the European _P. nigra_
L., with several varieties, is cultivated in Europe and occasionally in
the United States. The best known of these varieties, x _P. canadensis_
var. _Eugenie_ Schelle, the Carolina Poplar of American nurseries,
believed to be a hybrid of the northern Cottonwood with the Lombardy
Poplar, has been planted in the United States in immense numbers.

x _Populus Jackii_ Sarg., believed to be a hybrid of the northern
Cottonwood with _P. tacamahacca_, with characters intermediate between
those of its supposed parents, grows spontaneously near the mouth of the
Chateaugay River and at Beauharnois, Province of Quebec, and at South
Haven, Michigan, and is now occasionally cultivated.

chalky bluffs of Nueces Canyon of the upper Nueces River, Uvalde County,
growing with _Salix nigra_ var. _Lindheimeri_, _Carya pecan_, _Morus
rubra_ and _Ulmus crassifolia_, and at Strawn, Palo Pinto County, Texas.




                          2. SALIX L. Willow.


Trees or shrubs, with watery juice, scaly bark, soft wood, slender
terete tough branchlets often easily separated at the joints, and
winter-buds covered by a single scale of 2 coats, the inner
membranaceous, stipular, rarely separable from the outer, inclosing at
its base 2 minute opposite lateral buds alternate with 2 small
scale-like caducous leaves coated with long pale or rufous hairs. Leaves
variously folded in the bud, alternate, simple, lanceolate, obovate,
rotund or linear, penniveined; petioles sometimes glandular at the apex,
and more or less covering the bud, in falling leaving U-shaped or
arcuate elevated leaf-scars displaying the ends of 3 small equidistant
fibro-vascular bundles; stipules oblique, serrate, small and deciduous,
or foliaceous and often persistent, generally large and conspicuous on
vigorous young branches, leaving in falling minute persistent scars.
Flowers in sessile or stalked aments, terminal and axillary on leafy
branchlets; scales of the ament lanceolate, concave, rotund or obovate,
entire or glandular-dentate, of uniform color or dark-colored toward the
apex, more or less hairy, deciduous or persistent; disk of the flower
nectariferous, composed of an anterior and posterior or of a single
posterior gland-like body; stamens 3--12 or 1 or 2, inserted on the base
of the scale, with slender filaments free or rarely united and usually
light yellow, glabrous, or hairy toward the base, and small ovoid or
oblong anthers generally rose-colored before anthesis, becoming orange
or purple; ovary sessile or stipitate, conic, obtuse to
subulate-rostrate, glandular at the base, glabrous, tomentose or
villose, with an abbreviated style divided into 2 short recurved retuse
or 2-parted stigmas; ovules 4--8 on each of the 2 placentas. Fruit an
acuminate 1-celled capsule separating at maturity into 2 recurved
valves. Seeds minute, narrowed at the ends, dark chestnut-brown or
nearly black; cotyledons oblong.

Salix inhabits the banks of streams and low moist ground, the alpine
summits of mountains, and the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions of the
northern hemisphere, ranging south in the New World, with a few species,
through the West Indies and Central America to Brazil, and the Andes of
Chile, and in the Old World to Madagascar, southern Africa, the
Himalayas, Burmah, the Malay peninsula, Java, and Sumatra. Of the 160 or
170 species which are now recognized about seventy are found in North
America. Of these twenty-four attain the size and habit of trees, the
others being small and sometimes prostrate shrubs. Of exotic species,
_Salix alba_ L., and _Salix fragilis_ L., important European
timber-trees, are now generally naturalized in the northeastern states.
The flexible tough branches of several species are used in making
baskets; the bark is rich in tannic acid and is used in tanning leather
and yields salicin, a bitter principle valuable as a tonic. Many of the
species are cultivated as ornamental trees.

_Salix_ is the classical name of the Willow-tree.

lower Mississippi River and largely used for packing cases, cellar and
barn floors, in furniture, and in the manufacture of toys and other
purposes where strength is not important as it does not warp, check or
splinter.

Distribution. Low moist alluvial banks of streams and lakes; southern
New Brunswick through southern Quebec and Ontario to the region north of
Lake Superior, southward to northern and western North Carolina, through
the Piedmont region of South Carolina and Georgia to eastern and central
Alabama, and westward to southeastern North Dakota, eastern South
Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, the valley of Wichita River, Oklahoma, and
central and western Texas to Valverde County.

In southern Arkansas, in Louisiana and in eastern Texas _Salix nigra_ is
often replaced by var. _altissima_ Sarg., differing from the type in the
more pubescent young branchlets, leaves and petioles, in the more acute
base of the leaves and longer petioles, and in its later flowering. A
tree sometimes 120 feet high and the tallest of American Willows.

                             VI. MYRICACEAE.


Aromatic resinous trees and shrubs, with watery juice, terete branches,
and small scaly buds. Leaves alternate, revolute in the bud, serrate,
resinous-punctate, persistent in our species, in falling leaving
elevated semiorbicular leaf-scars showing the ends of three nearly
equidistant fibro-vascular bundles. Flowers unisexual, dioecious or
monoecious, usually subtended by minute bractlets, in the axils of the
deciduous scales of unisexual or androgynous simple oblong aments from
buds in the axils of the leaves of the year, opening in early spring,
the staminate below the pistillate in androgynous aments; staminate,
perianth 0; stamens 4 or many, inserted on the thickened base of the
scales of the ament; filaments slender, united at the base into a short
stipe; anthers ovoid, erect, 2-celled, introrse, opening longitudinally;
ovary rudimentary or 0; pistillate flowers single or in pairs; ovary
sessile, 1-celled; styles short, divided into 2 elongated filiform
stigmas stigmatic on the inner face; ovule solitary, erect from the base
of the cell, orthotropous, the micropyle superior. Fruit a globose or
ovoid dry drupe usually covered with waxy exudations; nut hard,
thick-walled. Seed erect, with a thin coat, without albumen; embryo
straight; cotyledons plano-convex, fleshy; radicle short, superior,
turned away from the minute basal hilum.

The family consists of the genus _Myrica_ L., of about thirty or forty
species of small trees and shrubs, widely distributed through the
temperate and warmer parts of both hemispheres. Of the seven North
American species three are trees. Wax is obtained from the exudations of
the fruit of several species. The bark is astringent, and sometimes used
in medicine, in tanning, and as an aniline dye. _Myrica_ rubra Sieb and
Zacc., of southern Japan and China, is cultivated for its succulent
aromatic red fruit.

The generic name is probably from the ancient name of some shrub,
possibly the Tamarisk.

pinnate deciduous leaves with elongated grooved petioles and without
stipules, the leaflets increasing in size from the lowest upward,
penniveined, sessile, short-stalked or the terminal usually
long-stalked. Flowers monoecious, opening after the unfolding of the
leaves, the staminate in lateral aments and composed of a 3--6-lobed
calyx in the axil of and adnate to an ovate acute bract, and numerous
stamens inserted on the inner and lower face of the calyx in 2 or
several rows, with short distinct filaments and oblong anthers opening
longitudinally; the pistillate in a spike terminal on a branch of the
year and composed of a 1--3-celled ovary subtended by an involucre free
toward the apex and formed by the union of an anterior bract and 2
lateral bractlets, a 1 or 4-lobed calyx inserted on the ovary, a short
style with 2 plumose stigmas stigmatic on the inner face, and a solitary
erect orthotropous ovule. Fruit drupaceous, the exocarp (husk)
indehiscent or 4-valved, inclosing a thick- or thin-shelled nut divided
by partitions extending inward from the shell, and like the shell more

leaf-scars displaying 3 equidistant U-shaped clusters of dark
fibro-vascular bundle-scars; leaflets conduplicate in the bud, ovate,
acute or acuminate, mostly unequal at base, with veins arcuate and
united near the margins. Aments of the staminate flowers many-flowered,
elongated, solitary or in pairs from lower axillary buds of upper nodes,
appearing from between persistent bud-scales in the autumn and remaining
during the winter as short cones covered by the closely imbricated
bracts of the flowers; calyx 3--6-lobed, its bract free only at the
apex; stamens 8--40, in 2 or several ranks, their anthers surmounted by
a conspicuous dilated truncate or lobed connective; pistillate flowers
in few-flowered spikes, their involucre villose, free only at the apex
and variously cut into a laciniate border (_corolla?_) shorter than the
erect calyx-lobes; ovary rarely of 3 carpels; stigmas club-shaped,
elongated, fimbriately plumose. Fruit ovoid, globose or pyriform, round
or obscurely 4-angled, with a fleshy indehiscent glabrate or hirsute
husk; nut ovoid or globose, more or less flattened, hard, thick-walled,
longitudinally and irregularly rugose, the valves alternate with the
cotyledons, and more or less ribbed along the dorsal sutures and in some
species also on the marginal sutures. Seed more or less compressed,
gradually narrowed or broad and deeply lobed at base, with conspicuous
dark veins radiating from the apex and from the minute basal hilum.

Juglans is confined to temperate North America, the West Indies, South
America from Venezuela to Peru, western and northern China, Korea,
Manchuria, Japan, and Formosa. Eleven species are known. Of exotic
species _Juglans regia_ L., an inhabitant probably originally of China,
is cultivated in the middle Atlantic and southern states and largely in
California for its edible nuts, which are an important article of
commerce. The wood of several species is valued for the interior finish
of houses and for furniture.

_Juglans_, from Jupiter and glands, is the classical name of the
Walnut-tree.

in diameter above its enlarged and buttressed base, stout slightly
spreading branches forming in the forest a narrow symmetrical and
inversely pyramidal head, or with abundant room a broad round-topped
crown, and branchlets at first slightly tinged with red and coated with
loose pale tomentum, becoming glabrous or puberulous in their first
winter, and marked by numerous oblong orange-colored lenticels and by
large oblong concave leaf-scars with a broad thin membranaceous border
surrounding the lower axillary bud. Winter-buds acute, compressed,
covered with clusters of bright yellow articulate hairs and pale
tomentum; terminal 1/2' long; axillary ovoid, often stalked, especially
the large upper bud. Bark 1'--1-1/2' thick, light brown tinged with red,
and deeply and irregularly divided into narrow forked ridges broken on

brittle, coarse-grained, light brown tinged with red, with thin light
brown sapwood; less valuable than that of most Hickories, and used
chiefly for fuel, and occasionally in the manufacture of wagons and
agricultural implements. The nuts, which vary in size and shape and in
the thickness of their shells and in the quality of the kernels, are an
important article of commerce.

Distribution. Low rich ground in the neighborhood of streams; in the
valley of the Mississippi River, Iowa (Clinton and Muscatine Counties),
southern Illinois, southwestern Indiana (Sullivan and Spencer Counties),
western Kentucky and Tennessee, western Mississippi and Louisiana,
extreme western and southwestern Missouri (Jackson County southward,
common only on the Marias de Cygne River), eastern Kansas to Kickapoo
Island in the Missouri River near Fort Leavenworth, Oklahoma to the
valley of the Salt Fork of the Arkansas River (near Alva, Woods County)
and to creek valleys near Cache, Comanche County (_G. W. Stevens_),
through Arkansas; and in Texas to the valley of the Devil's River and to
that of Warder's Creek, Hardiman County; reappearing on the mountains of
Mexico; most abundant and of its largest size in southern Arkansas and
eastern Texas.

Largely cultivated in the Southern States, in many selected varieties,
for its valuable nuts.

A natural hybrid, x _C. Brownii_ Sarg. of _C. cordiformis_ with _C.
pecan_, with characters intermediate between those of its supposed
parents, occurs on bottom-land of the Arkansas River near Van Buren,
Crawford County, Arkansas. Probably of the same parentage is the
so-called Galloway Nut found in Hamilton County, Ohio. Another hybrid, x
_C. Brownii_ var. _varians_ Sarg., probably of the same parentage also,
occurs near Van Buren. x _C. Laneyi_ Sarg., a natural hybrid evidently
of _C. cordiformis_ with _C. ovata_, has been found in Rochester, New
York, and trees considered varieties of the same hybrid, var.
_chateaugayensis_ Sarg., occur near the mouth of the Chateaugay River,

                             IX. BETULACEAE.


Trees, with sweet watery juice, without terminal buds, their slender
terete branchlets marked by numerous pale lenticels and lengthening by
one of the upper axillary buds formed in early summer, and alternate
simple penniveined usually doubly serrate deciduous stalked leaves,
obliquely plicately folded along the primary veins, their petioles in
falling leaving small semioval slightly oblique scars showing three
equidistant fibro-vascular bundle-scars; stipules inclosing the leaf in
the bud, fugacious. Flowers vernal, appearing with or before the
unfolding of the leaves, or rarely autumnal, monoecious, the staminate
1--3 together in the axils of the scales of an elongated pendulous
lateral ament and composed of a 2--4-parted membranaceous calyx and
2--20 stamens inserted on a receptacle, with distinct filaments and
2-celled erect extrorse anthers opening longitudinally, or without a
calyx, the pistillate in short lateral or capitate aments, with or
without a calyx, a 2-celled ovary, narrowed into a short style divided
into two elongated branches longer than the scales of the ament and
stigmatic on the inner face or at the apex, and a single anatropous
pendulous ovule in each cell of the ovary. Fruit a small mostly 1-celled
1-seeded nut, the outer layer of the shell light brown, thin and
membranaceous, the inner thick, hard, and bony. Seed solitary by
abortion, filling the cavity of the nut, suspended, without albumen, its
coat membranaceous, light chestnut-brown; cotyledons thick and fleshy,
much longer than the short superior radicle turned toward the minute
hilum.

Of the six genera, all confined to the northern hemisphere, five are
found in North America; of these only Corylus is shrubby.

conic buds covered by numerous imbricated scales, the inner lengthening
after the opening of the buds. Leaves open and concave in the bud,
ovate, acute, often cordate; stipules strap-shaped to oblong-obovate.
Flowers: staminate in aments emerging in very early spring from buds
produced the previous season near the ends of short lateral branchlets
of the year and inclosed during the winter, composed of 3--20 stamens
crowded on a pilose receptacle adnate to the base of a nearly sessile
ovate acute coriaceous scale longer than the stamens; filaments short,
slender, 2-branched, each branch bearing a 1-celled oblong yellow
half-anther hairy at the apex; pistillate in lax semi-erect aments
terminal on leafy branches of the year, in pairs at the base of an ovate
acute leafy deciduous scale, each flower subtended by a small acute
bract with two minute bractlets at its base; calyx adnate to the ovary
and dentate on the free narrow border. Nut ovoid, acute, compressed,
conspicuously longitudinally ribbed, bearing at the apex the remnants of
the calyx, marked on the broad base by a large pale scar and separating
at maturity in the autumn from the leaf-like 3-lobed conspicuously
serrate green involucre formed by the enlargement of the bract and
bractlets of the flower and inclosing only the base of the nut, fully
grown at mid-summer and loosely imbricated into a long-stalked open
cluster. (_Eucarpinus._)

Carpinus is confined to the northern hemisphere, and is distributed from
the Province of Quebec through the eastern United States to the
highlands of Central America in the New World, and from Sweden to
southern Europe, Asia Minor, the temperate Himalayas, Korea, southern
China, Japan and Formosa in the Old World. Fifteen or sixteen species
are recognized. Of the exotic species, the European and west Asian
_Carpinus Betulus_ L. is frequently planted as an ornamental tree in the
northeastern United States, where some of the species of eastern Asia
promise to become valuable.

_Carpinus_ is the classical name of the Hornbeam.

incisely lobed; stipules ovate and acute or oblong-obovate, scarious.
Flowers in 3-flowered cymes, the lateral flowers of the cyme subtended
by bractlets adnate to the base of the scale of the ament; staminate
aments long, pendulous, solitary or clustered, appearing in summer or
autumn in the axils of the last leaves of a branchlet or near the ends
of short lateral branchlets, erect and naked during the winter, their
scales in the spring broadly ovate, rounded, short-stalked, yellow or
orange-color below the middle and dark chestnut-brown and lustrous above
it; staminate flowers composed of a membranaceous 4-lobed calyx often
2-lobed by suppression, the anterior lobe obovate, rounded at apex, as
long as the stamens, much longer than the minute posterior lobe, and of
2 stamens inserted on the base of the calyx, with short 2-branched
filaments, each branch bearing an erect half-anther; pistillate aments
oblong or cylindric, terminal on the short spur-like lateral branchlets,
their scales closely imbricated, oblong-ovate, 3-lobed, light yellow,
often tinged with red above the middle, accrescent, becoming brown and
woody at maturity, and forming sessile or stalked erect or pendulous
short or elongated strobiles usually ripening in the autumn, deciduous
with the nuts from the slender rachis; calyx of the pistillate flower 0;
ovary sessile, compressed, with styles stigmatic at apex. Nut minute,
oval or obovoid, compressed, bearing at the apex the persistent stigmas,
marked at the base by a small pale scar, the outer coat of the shell
produced into a marginal wing interrupted at the apex.

Betula is widely distributed from the Arctic circle to Texas in the New
World, and to southern Europe, the Himalayas, China, and Japan in the
Old World, some species forming great forests at the north, or covering
high mountain slopes. Of the twenty-eight or thirty species now
recognized twelve are found in North America; of these nine are trees.
Of exotic species the European and Asiatic _Betula pendula_ Roth. in a
number of forms is a common ornamental tree in the northern states,
where several of the Birch-trees of eastern Asia also flourish. Many of
the species produce wood valued by the cabinet-maker, or used in the
manufacture of spools, shoe-lasts, and other small articles. The thin
layers of the bark are impervious to water and are used to cover
buildings, and for shoes, canoes, and boxes. The sweet sap provides an
agreeable beverage.

_Betula_ is the classical name of the Birch-tree.

pink. Fruit: strobiles oblong-ovoid, sessile, erect, glabrous,
1'--1-1/2' long, about 1/2' thick; nut obovoid, pointed at base, rounded
at apex, about as broad as its wing.

A tree, with aromatic bark and leaves, 70 deg.--80 deg. high, with a trunk
2 deg.--5 deg. in diameter, slender branches spreading almost at right angles,
becoming pendulous toward the ends and gradually forming a narrow
round-topped open graceful head, and branchlets light green, slightly
viscid and pilose when they first appear, soon turning dark
orange-brown, lustrous during the summer, bright red-brown in their
first winter, becoming darker and finally dark dull brown slightly
tinged with red. Winter-buds ovoid, acute, about 1/4' long, with ovate
acute light chestnut-brown loosely imbricated scales, those of the inner
ranks becoming 1/2'--3/4' long. Bark on young stems and branches close,
smooth, lustrous, dark brown tinged with red, and marked by elongated
horizontal pale lenticels, becoming on old trunks 1/2'--3/4' thick,
dull, deeply furrowed and broken into large thick irregular plates
covered with closely appressed scales. Wood heavy, very strong and hard,
close-grained, dark brown tinged with red, with thin light brown or
yellow sapwood of 70--80 layers of annual growth; largely used for
floors, in the manufacture of furniture and for fuel, and occasionally
in ship and boat-building. Sweet birch-oil distilled from the wood and
bark is used for medicinal purposes and for flavoring as a substitute
for oil of wintergreen, and beer is obtained by fermenting the sugary
sap.

Distribution. Rich uplands from southern Maine to northwestern Vermont,
and eastern Ohio and southward to northern Delaware and along the
Appalachian Mountains up to altitudes of 4000 deg. to northern Georgia; in
Alabama, and in eastern Kentucky and Tennessee; a common forest tree at
the north, and of its largest size on the western slopes of the southern
Alleghany Mountains.

1/4' long, somewhat viscid and covered with loose pale hairs during the
summer, becoming light chestnut-brown, acute, and slightly puberulous in
winter. Bark of young stems and of the branches bright silvery gray or
light orange color, very lustrous, separating into thin loose persistent
scales more or less rolled on the margins, becoming on old trees 1/2'
thick, reddish brown, and divided by narrow irregular fissures into
large thin plates covered with minute closely appressed scales, or
sometimes dull yellowish brown (_B. alleghaniensis_ Britt.). Wood heavy,
very strong, hard, close-grained, light brown tinged with red, with thin
nearly white sapwood; largely used for floors, in the manufacture of
furniture, button and tassel moulds, boxes, the hubs of wheels, and for
fuel.

Distribution. Moist uplands, and southward often in swamps; one of the
largest deciduous-leaved trees of northeastern America; Newfoundland and
along the northern shores of the Gulf of St. Lawrence to the valley of
Rainy River, and southward to Long Island (Cold Spring Harbor) and

ground into 2 or 3 slightly diverging limbs, and sometimes 5 deg. in
diameter, slender branches forming in old age a narrow irregular
picturesque crown, and branchlets coated at first with thick pale or
slightly rufous tomentum gradually disappearing before winter, becoming
dark red and lustrous, dull red-brown in their second year, and then
gradually growing slightly darker until the bark separates into the thin
flakes of the older branches; or often sending up from the ground a
clump of several small spreading stems forming a low bushy tree.
Winter-buds ovoid, acute, about 1/4' long, covered in summer with thick
pale tomentum, glabrous or slightly puberulous, lustrous and bright
chestnut-brown in winter, the inner scales strap-shaped, light brown
tinged with red, and coated with pale hairs. Bark on young stems and
large branches thin, lustrous, light reddish brown or silvery gray,
marked by narrow slightly darker longitudinal lenticels, separating
freely into large thin papery scales persistent for several years, and
turning back and showing the light pink-brown tints of the freshly
exposed inner layers, becoming at the base of old trunks from 3/4'--1'
thick, dark red-brown, deeply furrowed and broken on the surface into
thick closely appressed scales. Wood light, rather hard, strong,
close-grained, light brown, with pale sapwood of 40--50 layers of annual
growth; used in the manufacture of furniture, wooden ware, wooden shoes,

[Illustration: Fig. 197]

Leaves nearly triangular to rhombic, long-pointed, coarsely doubly
serrate with stout spreading glandular teeth except at the broad
truncate or slightly cordate or cuneate base, thin and firm, dark green
and lustrous and somewhat roughened on the upper surface early in the
season by small pale glands in the axils of the conspicuous reticulate
veinlets, 2-1/2'--3' long, 1-1/2'--2-1/2' wide, with a stout yellow
midrib covered with minute glands, and raised and rounded on the upper
side, and obscure yellow primary veins; turning pale yellow in the
autumn; petioles slender, terete, covered with black glands, often
stained with red on the upper side, 3/4'--1' long; stipules broadly
ovate, acute, membranaceous, light green slightly tinged with red.
Flowers: staminate aments usually solitary or rarely in pairs,
1-1/4'--1-1/2' long, about 1/8' thick during the winter, becoming
2-1/2'--4' long, with ovate acute apiculate scales; pistillate aments
slender, as long as their glandular peduncles about 1/2' in length, with
ovate acute pale green glandular scales. Fruit: strobiles cylindric,
pubescent, obtuse at apex, about 3/4' long and 1/3' thick, pendant or
spreading on slender stems; nut ellipsoidal to obovoid, acute or rounded
at base, a little narrower than its obovate wing.

A short-lived tree, 20 deg.--30 deg. or exceptionally 40 deg. high, with a trunk
rarely 18' in diameter, short slender often pendulous more or less
contorted branches usually clothing the stem to the ground and forming a
narrow pyramidal head, and branchlets roughened by small raised
lenticels, resinous-glandular when they first appear, gradually growing
darker, bright yellow and lustrous before autumn like the young stems,
bright reddish brown during their first winter, and ultimately white
near the trunk; often growing in clusters of spreading stems springing
from the stumps of old trees. Winter-buds ovoid, acute, pale
chestnut-brown, glabrous, about 1/4' long. Bark about 1/3' thick, dull
chalky white on the outer surface, bright orange on the inner, close and
firm, with dark triangular markings at the insertion of the branches,
becoming at the base of old trees thicker, nearly black, and irregularly
broken by shallow fissures. Wood light, soft, not strong, close-grained,
not durable, light brown, with thick nearly white sapwood; used in the
manufacture of spools, shoe-pegs and wood pulp, for the hoops of
barrels, and largely for fuel.

Distribution. Dry gravelly barren soil or on the margins of swamps and
ponds; Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and the valley
of the lower St. Lawrence River southward to northeastern, central and
on South Mountain, Franklin County, Pennsylvania, and northern Delaware,
and westward through northern New England and New York, ascending
sometimes to altitudes of 1800 deg., to the southern shores of Lake Ontario,
and at the foot of Lake Michigan, Indiana; rare and local in the
interior, very abundant in the coast region of New England and the
middle states; springing up in great numbers on abandoned farm-lands or
on lands stripped by fire of their original forest covering; most
valuable in its ability to grow rapidly in sterile soil and to afford
protection to the seedlings of more valuable and less rapid-growing
trees.

A form with deeply divided leaves (var. _laciniata_ Loud.) and one with
purple leaves (var. _purpurea_ E & B) are occasionally cultivated.

A tree, rarely more than 30 deg. high, with a trunk 8'--10' in diameter,
small ascending finally spreading branches, and slender branchlets
marked by numerous small raised pale lenticels, purplish and sparingly
villose when they first appear, soon glabrous, becoming bright
red-brown; often forming clumps of several stems. Bark thin, white
tinged with rose, lustrous, not readily separable into layers, the inner
bark light orange color.

Distribution. Moist slopes, Stratton and Windham, Windham County,
Vermont, at altitudes of about 1800 deg. (_W. H. Blanchard_), Haystack
Mountain, Aroostook County, Maine (_M. L. Fernald_); the American
representative of the European _Betula pendula_ Roth., and probably
widely distributed over the hills of northern New England and eastern
Canada. Perhaps with its variety best considered a natural hybrid
between _B. papyrifera_ and _B. populifolia_.

Apparently passing into a form with larger leaves often rounded and
truncate at the broad base, 3'--3-1/2' long and 2' wide, stouter
staminate aments, and strobiles frequently 1-1/2' long and 1/2' thick
(var. _Blanchardii_ Sarg. fig. 198 A). This under favorable conditions
is a tree 60 deg.--70 deg. high, with a trunk 18' in diameter; common with
_Betula coerulea_ at Windham and Stratton, Vermont (_W. H. Blanchard_),
and on a hill near the coast in Washington County, Maine (_M. L.
Fernald_).

brown or nearly black, sharply and irregularly furrowed and broken on
the surface into thick closely appressed scales. Wood light, strong,
hard, tough, very close-grained, light brown tinged with red, with thick
nearly white sapwood; largely used for spools, shoe-lasts, pegs, and in
turnery, the manufacture of wood-pulp, and for fuel. The tough resinous
durable bark impervious to water is used by all the northern Indians to
cover their canoes and for baskets, bags, drinking-cups, and other small
articles, and often to cover their wigwams in winter.

Distribution. Rich wooded slopes and the borders of streams, lakes, and
swamps scattered through forests of other trees; Labrador to the
southern shores of Hudson's Bay, and southward to Long Island, New York,

Trees and shrubs, with astringent scaly bark, soft straight-grained
wood, naked stipitate winter-buds formed in summer and nearly inclosed
by the united stipules of the first leaf, becoming thick, resinous, and

color; stipules of all but the first leaf ovate, acute, and scarious.
Flowers vernal, or rarely opening in the autumn from aments of the year,
in 1--3-flowered cymes in the axils of the peltate short-stalked scales
of stalked aments formed in summer or autumn in the axils of the last
leaves of the year or of those of minute leafy bracts; staminate aments
elongated, pendulous, paniculate, naked and erect during the winter,
each staminate flower subtended by 3--5 minute bractlets adnate to the
scales of the ament, and composed of a 4-parted calyx, and 1--3 or
usually 4 stamens inserted on the base of the calyx opposite its lobes,
with short simple filaments; pistillate aments ovoid or oblong, erect,
stalked, produced in summer in the axils of the leaves of a branch
developed from the axils of an upper leaf of the year, and below the
staminate inflorescence, inclosed at first in the stipules of the first
leaf, emerging in the autumn and naked during the winter, or remaining
covered until early spring; pistillate flowers in pairs, each flower
subtended by 2--4 minute bractlets adnate to the fleshy scale of the
ament becoming at maturity thick and woody, obovate, 3--5-lobed or

Alnus inhabits swamps, river bottom-lands, and high mountains, and is
widely and generally distributed through the northern hemisphere, often
forming the most conspicuous feature of vegetation on mountain slopes,
ranging at high altitudes southward in the New World through Central
America to Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia, and to upper Assam and Japan in
the Old World. Of the eighteen or twenty species now recognized nine are
North American; of these, six attain the size and habit of trees. Of the
exotic species, _Alnus vulgaris_ Hill., a common European, north
African, and Asiatic timber-tree, was introduced many years ago into the
northeastern states, where it has become locally naturalized. The wood
of Alnus is very durable in water, and the astringent bark and strobiles
are used in tanning leather and in medicine.

_Alnus_ is the classical name of the Alder.

ovules from the tip of the hairy dissepiment of the ovary pushed by the
growth of the seed into one of the angles of the nut; cotyledons sweet,
oily, plano-convex.

Fagus as here limited is confined to the northern hemisphere, with a
single American species and seven Old World species; of these one is
widely distributed through Europe, another is found in the Caucasus, and
the others are confined to eastern temperate Asia. Of exotic species,
the European _Fagus sylvatica_ L., an important timber-tree, is
frequently planted for ornament in the eastern states in several of its
forms, especially those with purple leaves, and with pendulous branches.
The wood of Fagus is hard and close-grained. The sweet seeds are a
favorite food of swine, and yield a valuable oil.

_Fagus_ is the classical name of the Beech-tree.

Leaves remote at the ends of the branches and clustered on short lateral
branchlets, oblong-ovate, acuminate with a long slender point, coarsely
serrate with spreading or incurved triangular teeth except at the
gradually narrowed generally cuneate base, when they unfold pale green
and clothed on the lower surface and margins with long pale lustrous
silky hairs, at maturity dull dark bluish green above, light
yellow-green, very lustrous, and glabrous or rarely pilose below (f.
_pubescens_ Fern. & Rehd.) with tufts of long pale hairs in the axils of
the veins, 2-1/2'--5' long, 1'--3' wide, with a slender yellow midrib
covered above with short pale hairs, and slender primary veins running
obliquely to the points of the teeth; turning bright clear yellow in the

stipules ovate-lanceolate on the lower leaves, strap-shaped to
linear-lanceolate on the upper, brown or often red below the middle,
membranaceous, lustrous, 1'--1-1/2' long. Flowers opening when the
leaves are about one third grown; staminate in globose heads 1' in
diameter, on slender hairy peduncles about 2' long; pistillate in
usually 2-flowered clusters, on short clavate hoary peduncles 1/2'--3/4'
long. Fruit: involucres 1/2'--3/4' in length often shorter than the
nuts, on stout hairy club-shaped peduncles 1/4'--3/4' long, fully grown
at midsummer, and then puberulous, dark orange-green, and covered by
long slender recurved prickles red above the middle, becoming at
maturity in the autumn light brown and tomentose, with crowded much
recurved pubescent prickles, persistent on the branch after opening late
into the winter; nut about 3/4' long.

A tree, usually 70 deg.--80 deg. but exceptionally 120 deg. high, sending up from
the roots numerous small stems sometimes extending into broad thickets
round the parent tree, in the forest with a long comparatively slender
stem free of branches for more than half its length, and short branches
forming a narrow head, in open situations short-stemmed, with a trunk
often 3 deg.--4 deg. in diameter, and numerous limbs spreading gradually and
forming a broad compact round-topped head of slender slightly drooping
branches clothed with short leafy laterals, and branchlets pale green
and coated with long soft caducous hairs when they first appear,
olive-green or orange-colored during their first summer, and
conspicuously marked by oblong bright orange lenticels, gradually
growing red, bright reddish brown during their first winter, darker
brown in their second season and ultimately ashy gray. Winter-buds
puberulous, especially toward the apex, 3/4' to nearly 1' long, about
1/8' broad, the inner scales hirsute on the inner surface and along the
margins and when fully grown often 1' long, lustrous, brown above the
middle, and reddish below. Bark 1/4'--1/2' thick, with a smooth light
steel-gray surface. Wood hard, strong, tough, very close-grained, not
durable, difficult to season, dark or often light red, with thin nearly
white sapwood of 20--30 layers of annual growth; largely used in the
manufacture of chairs, shoe-lasts, plane-stocks, the handles of tools,
and for fuel. The sweet nuts are gathered and sold in the markets of
Canada and of some of the western and middle states.

Distribution. Rich uplands and mountain slopes, often forming nearly
pure forests, and southward on the bottom-lands of streams and the
margins of swamps; valley of the Restigouche River, New Brunswick, to
the northern shores of Lake Huron and the southern shores of Lake
Superior, and southward to Virginia, Ohio, Michigan, the ravines of Rock
River near Oregon, Ogle County, Illinois, Minnesota and northern
Missouri; southward passing into the var. _caroliniana_ Fern. & Rehd.,
differing in its ovate to short-ovate thicker leaves, usually rounded or
subcordate at base, and often less coarsely serrate or undulate on the
margins, glabrous or rarely densely soft pubescent below (f. _mollis_
Fern. & Rehd.), in the often shorter involucre of the fruit with shorter
and less crowded prickles; usually on the bottom-lands of streams and
the borders of swamps, New Jersey, and southern Ohio and Missouri to
western Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, eastern Texas, and
northeastern Oklahoma; ascending on the southern Appalachian Mountains
to altitudes of 3000 deg.; probably growing to its largest size in eastern
Louisiana.

The northern form is occasionally planted in the northern states as a
shade and park tree.

Trees or shrubs, with furrowed bark, porous brittle wood, durable in the
ground, terete branchlets without terminal buds, axillary buds covered
by 2 pairs of slightly imbricated scales, the outer lateral, the others
accrescent, becoming oblong-ovate and acute and marking the base of the
branch with narrow ring-like scars, and stout perpendicular tap-roots;
producing when cut numerous stout shoots from the stump. Leaves
convolute in the bud, ovate, acute, coarsely serrate, except at the
base, with thin veins running to the points of the slender glandular
teeth, deciduous; petioles leaving in falling small elevated semioval
leaf-scars marked by an irregular marginal row of minute fibro-vascular
bundle-scars; stipules ovate to linear-lanceolate, acute, scarious,
infolding the leaf in the bud, caducous. Flowers opening in early
summer, unisexual, strong-smelling; the staminate, in 3--7-flowered
cymes, in the axils of minute ovate bracts, in elongated simple
deciduous aments first appearing with the unfolding of the leaves from
the inner scales of the terminal bud and from the axils of the lower
leaves of the year, composed of a pale straw-colored slightly puberulous
calyx deeply divided into 6 ovate rounded segments imbricated in the
bud, and 10--20 stamens inserted on the slightly thickened torus, with
filiform filaments incurved in the bud, becoming elongated and exserted,
and ovoid or globose pale yellow anthers; the pistillate scattered or
spicate at the base of the shorter persistent androgynous aments from
the axils of later leaves, sessile, 2 or 3 together or solitary within a
short-stemmed or sessile involucre of closely imbricated oblong acute
bright green bracts scurfy-pubescent or tomentose below the middle,
subtended by a bract and 2 lateral bractlets, each flower composed of an
urn-shaped calyx, with a short limb divided into 6 obtuse lobes, minute
sterile stamens shorter than the calyx-lobes, an ovary 6-celled after
fecundation, with 6 linear spreading white styles hairy below the middle
and tipped by minute acute stigmas, and 2 ovules in each cell, attached
on its inner angle, descending, semianatropous. Fruit maturing in one
season, its involucre inclosing 1--3 nuts, globose or short-oblong,
pubescent or tomentose and spiny on the outer surface, with elongated
ridged bright green ultimately brown branched spines fascicled between
the deciduous scales, coated on the inner surface with lustrous
pubescence, splitting at maturity into 2--4 valves; nut ovoid, acute,
crowned by the remnants of the style, bright chestnut-brown and
lustrous, tomentose or pubescent at apex, cylindrical, or when more than
1 flattened, marked at the broad base by a large conspicuous pale
circular or oval thickened scar, its shell lined with rufous or hoary
tomentum. Seed usually solitary by abortion, dark chestnut-brown, marked
at apex by the abortive ovules, with thick and fleshy more or less
undulate ruminate sweet farinaceous cotyledons.

Castanea is confined to the northern hemisphere, and is widely
distributed through eastern North America, southern Europe, northern
Africa, southwestern Asia, and central and northern China, Korea, and
Japan. Seven species are distinguished. In the countries of the
Mediterranean Basin much attention has been given to improving the fruit
of the native species _Castanea sativa_ Mill., which is occasionally
planted in the middle United States; in Japan the seeds of _Castanea
crenata_ S. & Zucc. in many varieties and in China those of _Castanea
mollissima_ Bl. are important articles of food. Castanea produces
coarse-grained wood very durable in contact with the soil, and rich in
tannin. Chestnut-trees suffer in the eastern United States from the
attacks of a fungus, _Endothia parasitica_ Anders. which has nearly
exterminated them in many parts of the country.

_Castanea_ is the classical name of the Chestnut-tree.

thin lighter colored sapwood of 3 or 4 layers of annual growth; largely
used in the manufacture of cheap furniture and in the interior finish of
houses, for railway-ties, fence-posts, and rails. The nuts, which are
superior to those of the Old World chestnuts in sweetness were formerly
gathered in great quantities in the forest and sold in the markets of
the eastern cities.

central and southeastern Mississippi (Pearl River County), and to
central Kentucky and Tennessee; very common on the glacial drift of the
northern states and, except at the north, mostly confined to the
Appalachian hills; attaining its greatest size in western North Carolina
and eastern Tennessee.

Formerly sometimes planted in the eastern states as an ornamental and
timber tree, and for its nuts, of which several varieties have been
recognized.

Castanopsis inhabits California with two species, and southeastern Asia
where it is distributed with about twenty-five species from southern
China to the Malay Archipelago and the eastern Himalayas. Of the
California species one is usually arborescent and the other _Castanopsis
sempervirens_ Dudley is a low alpine shrub of the coast ranges and the
Sierra Nevada.

_Castanopsis_ from {kastana} and {opsis}, in allusion to its resemblance
to the Chestnut-tree.

Quercus inhabits the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere and
high altitudes within the tropics, ranging in the New World southward to
the mountains of Colombia and in the Old World to the Indian
Archipelago. Two hundred and seventy-five species have been described;
of the North American species fifty-four are large or small trees. Of
exotic species, the European _Quercus Robur_ L., and _Quercus
sessiliflora_ Salisb., have been frequently cultivated as ornamental
trees in the eastern United States, where, however, they are usually
short-lived and unsatisfactory. Many of the species are important
timber-trees; their bark is often rich in tannin and is used for tanning
leather, and all produce wood valuable for fuel and in the manufacture
of charcoal.

_Quercus_ is the classical name of the Oak-tree.

divided into broad rounded ridges covered with small closely appressed
scales. Wood heavy, hard, strong, rather tough, close-grained, durable
in contact with the soil, largely used for fencing, railway-ties, and
fuel. The bark, which is rich in tannin, is consumed in large quantities
in tanning leather.

Distribution. Hillsides and the high rocky banks of streams in rich and
deep or sometimes in sterile soil; coast of southern Maine, southern New
Hampshire and eastern Massachusetts, southward to Delaware and the

Ontario; abundant on the banks of the lower Hudson River and on the
Appalachian hills from southern New York to Alabama; most common and of
its largest size on the lower slopes of the mountains of the Carolinas
and Tennessee, here often forming a large part of the forest.

                            1. ULMUS L. Elm.


Trees, or rarely shrubs, with deeply furrowed bark, branchlets often
furnished with corky wings, and buds with numerous ovate rounded
chestnut-brown scales closely imbricated in two ranks, increasing in
size from without inward, the inner accrescent, replacing the stipules
of the first leaves, deciduous, marking the base of the branchlet with
persistent ring-like scars. Leaves simply or doubly serrate; stipules
linear, lanceolate to obovate, entire, free or connate at base,
scarious, inclosing the leaf in the bud, caducous. Flowers from axillary
buds near the ends of the branches similar to but larger than the
leaf-buds, the outer scales sterile, the inner bearing flowers and
rarely leaves. Flowers perfect, jointed on slender bibracteolate
pedicels from the axils of linear acute scarious bracts, in pedunculate
or subsessile fascicles or cymes sometimes becoming racemose, appearing
in early spring before the leaves in the axils of those of the previous
year, or autumnal in the axils of leaves of the year; calyx campanulate,
5--9-lobed, membranaceous, marcescent; stamens 5 or 6 inserted under the
ovary; filaments filiform or slightly flattened, erect in the bud,
becoming exserted; anthers oblong, emarginate, and subcordate; ovary
sessile or stipitate, compressed, crowned by a simple deeply 2-lobed
style, the spreading lobes papillo-stigmatic on the inner face, usually
1-celled by abortion, rarely 2-celled; ovule amphitropous; micropyle
extrorse, superior. Fruit an ovoid or oblong, often oblique, sessile or
stipitate samara surrounded at base by the remnants of the calyx, the
seminal cavity compressed, slightly thickened on the margin,
chartaceous, produced into a thin reticulate-venulose membranaceous
light brown broad or rarely narrow wing naked or ciliate on the margin,
tipped with the remnants of the persistent style, or more or less deeply
notched at apex, and often marked by the thickened line of the union of
the two carpels. Seed ovoid, compressed, without albumen, marked on the
ventral edge by the thin raphe; testa membranaceous, light or dark
chestnut-brown, of two coats, rarely produced into a narrow wing; embryo
erect; cotyledons flat or slightly convex, much longer than the superior
radicle turned toward the oblong linear pale hilum.

Ulmus, with eighteen or twenty species, is widely distributed through
the boreal and temperate regions of the northern hemisphere with the
exception of western North America, reaching in the New World the
mountains of southern Mexico and in the Old World the Sikkim Himalaya,
western China, and Japan. Of the exotic species, _Ulmus procera_
Salisb., the so-called English Elm, and _Ulmus glabra_, Huds., the
Scotch Elm, and several of its varieties, have been largely planted for
shade and ornament in the north Atlantic states, where old and large
specimens of the former can be seen, especially in the neighborhood of
Boston.

Ulmus produces heavy, hard, tough, light-colored wood, often difficult
to split. The tough inner bark of some of the species is made into ropes
or woven into coarse cloth, and in northern China nourishing
mucilaginous food is prepared from the inner bark.

_Ulmus_ is the classical name of the Elm-tree.

only, all arborescent, are indigenous in North America, although
_Broussonetia papyrifera_ Vent., the Paper Mulberry, a tree related to
the Mulberry and a native of eastern Asia, and the Hop and the Hemp are
more or less generally naturalized in the eastern and southern states.

nearly to the base into 2 equal spreading filiform villose white
stigmatic lobes; ovule suspended from the apex of the cell,
campylotropous; micropyle superior. Drupes ovoid or obovoid, crowned
with the remnants of the styles, inclosed in the succulent thickened and
colored perianth of the flower and more or less united into a more or
less juicy compound fruit; flesh subsucculent, thin; walls of the nutlet
thin or thick, crustaceous. Seed oblong, pendulous; testa, thin,
membranaceous; hilum minute, apical; embryo incurved in thick fleshy

Morus with eight or nine species is confined to eastern temperate North
America, the elevated regions of Mexico, Central America and western
South America, southern and western Asia, Indo-China, China, Japan, the
Bonin Islands and the mountains of the Indian Archipelago. Two species
occur in North America. The most valuable species, _Morus alba_ L., a
native of China and Formosa, and largely cultivated in many countries
for its leaves, which are the best food of the silkworm, has been
planted in large quantities in the eastern United States; and _Morus
nigra_ L., probably a native of Persia, has been introduced into the
southern and Pacific states for its large dark-colored juicy fruit.
Morus produces straight-grained durable light brown or orange-colored
valuable wood, and sweet acidulous and refreshing fruits.

_Morus_ is the classical name of the Mulberry-tree.

and stout erect ultimately spreading branches forming a handsome open
irregular round-topped head, and branchlets light green often tinged
with red and coated with soft pale pubescence when they first appear,
soon becoming glabrous, light brown slightly tinged with orange color
during their first winter, and ultimately paler. Winter-buds
depressed-globose, partly immersed in the bark, covered by few closely
imbricated ovate rounded light chestnut-brown ciliate conspicuous
scales. Bark 2/3'--1' thick, and deeply and irregularly divided into
broad rounded ridges separating on the surface into thin appressed
scales. Wood heavy, exceedingly hard, very strong, flexible,
coarse-grained, very durable, bright orange color turning brown on
exposure, with thin light yellow sapwood of 5--10 layers of annual
growth; largely used for fence-posts, railway-ties, wheel-stock, and
formerly by the Osage and other Indians west of the Mississippi River
for bows and war-clubs. The bark of the roots contains moric and
morintannic acid, and is used as a yellow dye. The bark of the trunk is
sometimes used in tanning leather.

Distribution. Rich bottom-lands; southern Arkansas to southern Oklahoma
and southward in Texas to about latitude 35 deg. 36'; most abundant and of
its largest size in the valley of the Red River in Oklahoma.

Trees, with milky juice, naked buds, stout branchlets, thick fleshy
roots frequently produced from the branches and developing into
supplementary stems. Leaves involute, entire and persistent in American
species; stipules inclosing the leaf in a slender sharp-pointed bud-like
cover, interpetiolar, embracing the leaf-bearing axis and inclosing the
young leaves, deciduous. Flower-bearing receptacle subglobose to ovoid,
sessile or stalked, solitary by abortion or in pairs in the axils of
existing or fallen leaves, surrounded at base by 3 anterior bracts
distinct or united into an involucral cup bearing on the interior at the
apex numerous rows of minute triangular viscid bracts closing the
orifice, those of the lower rows turned downward and infolding the upper
flowers, those immediately above these horizontal and forming a more or
less prominent umbilicus. Flowers sessile or pedicellate, the pedicels
thickening and becoming succulent with the ripening of the fruit,
unisexual, often separated by chaffy scales or hairs; calyx of the
staminate flower usually divided into 2--6 sepals; stamen 1; filament
short, erect; anther innate, ovoid, broad and subrotund, 2-celled, the
cells opening longitudinally, 0 in the pistillate flower; sepals or
lobes of the calyx of the pistillate flower usually narrower than those
of the staminate flower; ovary sessile, erect or oblique, surmounted by
the lateral elongated style crowned by a 2-lobed stigma; ovule suspended
from the apex or lateral below the apex of the cell, anatropous. Fruit
mostly immersed in the thickened succulent receptacle, obovoid or
reniform; flesh thin, mucilaginous; nutlet with a flat crustaceous
minutely tuberculate shell. Seed suspended; testa membranaceous; embryo
incurved, in thin fleshy albumen, cotyledons equal or unequal, longer
than the incumbent radicle.

Ficus, of which about six hundred species have been described, is
largely distributed through the topics of both hemispheres, the largest
number of species being found on the islands of the Indian Archipelago
and the Pacific Ocean. A few species extend beyond the tropics into
southern Florida, Mexico, Argentina, southern Japan and China, the
countries bordering the Mediterranean, the Canary Islands, and South
Africa. Two species of the section _Urostigma_ with monoecious flowers
occur in tropical Florida. _Ficus Carica_ L., probably a native of the
Mediterranean basin, is cultivated in the southern states and in
California for its large sweet succulent fruits, the figs of commerce.

Trees, with ashy gray or brown smooth or scaly bark, branchlets
conspicuously marked by large horizontal or longitudinal leaf-scars and
by narrow stipular rings, and large terete acuminate or often
obtusely-pointed more or less gibbous winter-buds usually broadest at
the middle, their scales large membranaceous stipules adnate to the base
of the petioles and deciduous with the unfolding of each successive
leaf, the petiole of the outer stipule rudimentary, adnate on the
straight side of the bud, and marked at its apex by the scar left by the
falling of the last leaf of the previous season. Leaves entire,
sometimes auriculate, persistent or deciduous, often minutely punctate,
their numerous primary veins arcuate and more or less united within the
margins. Flowers appearing in the American species after the leaves,
their stipular spathes thin and membranaceous; sepals 3, spreading or
reflexed; petals 6--12 in series of 3's, concave, erect or spreading;
stamens early deciduous, their filaments shorter than the 2-celled
introrse anthers and terminating in apiculate fleshy connectives; ovary
sessile, 1-celled; style short, recurved, stigmatic on the inner face;
ovules horizontal. Fruit a scarlet or rusty brown cone formed of the
coalescent 2-seeded drupaceous persistent follicles opening on the back;
seeds suspended at maturity by long thin cords of unrolled spiral
vessels; seed-coat thick, drupaceous, the outer portion becoming fleshy
and at maturity pulpy, red or scarlet, the inner crustaceous; embryo
minute at the base of the fleshy homogeneous albumen, its radicle next
the hilum; cotyledons short and spreading.

Magnolia with about thirty species is confined to eastern North America,
southern Mexico, and eastern and southern Asia, seven species growing
naturally in the United States. All the parts are slightly bitter and
aromatic, and the dried flower-buds are sometimes used in medicine.
Several species from eastern Asia and their hybrids producing flowers
before the appearance of the leaves are favorite garden plants in the
United States.

The genus is named in honor of Pierre Magnol (1638--1715), professor of
botany at Montpellier.

used in the southern states in the manufacture of broom handles and
other articles of wooden ware.

Distribution. Borders of Pine-barren ponds, in shallow swamps and on
rich hummocks usually in the neighborhood of the coast; swamps of the
lower Cape Fear River near Wilmington, New Hanover County, North

subulate persistent tips; seeds obovoid, compressed, 5/8' long.

A tree, 30 deg.--40 deg. high, with a straight or inclining trunk 12'--18' in
diameter, often undivided for half its length or separating at the
ground into a number of stout diverging stems, regular wide-spreading or
more or less contorted and erect branches, and stout brittle branchlets
soon becoming bright red-brown, lustrous, marked by numerous minute pale
lenticels and in their first winter by the low horizontal leaf-scars
with crowded compressed fibro-vascular bundle-scars, and grayish in
their second year. Winter-buds: terminal, glabrous, purple, 1-1/2'--2'
long, 1/2' thick; axillary, minute and obtuse. Bark rarely more than
1/3' thick, dark brown, smooth, covered by small excrescences, or on old

                           2. LIRIODENDRON L.


Trees, with deeply furrowed brown bitter bark, and slender branchlets
marked by elevated leaf-scars and narrow stipular rings, and compressed
obtuse winter-buds, their scales membranaceous stipules joined at the
edges, accrescent, strap-shaped, often slightly falcate, oblique at the
unequal base, tardily deciduous after the unfolding of the leaf. Leaves
recurved in the bud by the bending down of the petiole near the middle,
bringing the apex of the blade to the base of the bud, sinuately
4-lobed, heart-shaped, truncate or slightly cuneate at base, truncate at
apex by a broad shallow sinus, and minutely apiculate. Flowers appearing
after the unfolding of the leaves, cup-shaped, conspicuous, inclosed in
the bud in a 2-valved stipular membranaceous caducous spathe; sepals
spreading or reflexed, ovate-lanceolate, concave, greenish white, early
deciduous; petals erect, rounded at base, early deciduous; filaments
filiform, half as long as the linear 2-celled extrorse anthers adnate to
the outer face of the connective terminating in a short fleshy point;
pistils imbricated on the elongated sessile receptacle into a
spindle-shaped column; ovary inserted by a broad base; style narrowly
acuminate, laterally flattened, appressed; stigmas short, recurved at
the summit; ovules 2, suspended from near the middle of the ventral
suture. Fruit a narrow light brown cone formed of the closely imbricated
dry and woody indehiscent carpels consisting of a laterally compressed
4-ribbed pericarp, the lateral ribs confluent into the margins of the
large wing-like lanceolate compressed style marked vertically by a thin
sutural line, the carpels deciduous when ripe in the autumn from the
slender elongated axis of the fruit persistent on the branch during the
winter. Seeds suspended, 2 or single by abortion; testa thin,
coriaceous, and marked by a narrow prominent raphe; embryo minute at the
base of the fleshy albumen, its radicle next the hilum.

Liriodendron, widely distributed in North America and Europe during the
cretaceous period, is now represented by two species, one in eastern
North America, the other _L. chinensis_ Sarg. in central China.

_Liriodendron_, from {lirion} and {dendron}, is descriptive of the
lily-like flower.

diameter, destitute of branches for 80 deg.--100 deg. from the ground, short,
comparatively small branches forming a narrow pyramidal, or in old age a
broader spreading head, and slender branchlets light yellow-green and
often covered with a glaucous bloom during their first summer, reddish
brown, lustrous, and marked during their first winter by many small pale
lenticels and roughened by the elevated orbicular or semiorbicular
leaf-scars marked by numerous small scattered fibro-vascular
bundle-scars, and dark gray during their third year. Winter-buds dark
red covered by a glaucous bloom, the terminal 1/2' long, much longer
than the lateral buds. Bark thin and scaly on young trees, becoming
deeply furrowed, brown, and 1'--2' thick. Wood light, soft, brittle, not
strong, easily worked, light yellow or brown, with thin creamy white
sapwood; largely manufactured into lumber used in construction, the
interior finish of houses, boat-building, and for shingles, brooms, and
wooden ware. The intensely acrid bitter inner bark, especially of the
roots, is used domestically as a tonic and stimulant, and hydrochlorate
of tulipiferine, an alkaloid separated from the bark, possesses the
property of stimulating the heart.

Distribution. Deep rich rather moist soil on the intervales of streams
or on mountain slopes; Worcester County, Massachusetts, to southwestern
Vermont (Pownal, Bennington County), and westward to southern Ontario,
southern Michigan and northeastern Missouri, and southward to Orange
County (Rock Spring Run), Florida, southern Alabama, Mississippi and
Louisiana, southeastern Missouri and northeastern Arkansas; most
abundant and of its largest size in the valleys of the lower Ohio basin,
and on the slopes of the mountains of North Carolina and Tennessee up to

Of the fifty species of Anona widely distributed in the tropics of the
two worlds, a single species reaches the coast of southern Florida. Of
exotic species, _Anona muricata_ L., the Soursop and _Anona reticulata_
L., of the West Indies, and _Anona Cherimolia_ Mill., of western
tropical America, are now occasionally cultivated as fruit-trees in
Florida.

_Anona_ is the name given by early authors to the Soursop.

About one hundred species of Persea are distinguished. They are
distributed in the New World, from the coast region of the southeastern
United States and Texas to Brazil and Chile, and occur in the Canary
Islands and in tropical and subtropical Asia. _Persea americana_ Mill.,
the Avocado or Alligator Pear, a native of the Antilles and cultivated
for its edible fruit in all tropical countries, is now sparingly
naturalized in southern Florida. Many species yield hard dark-colored
handsome wood valued in cabinet-making.

_Persea_ was the classical name of a tree of the Orient, transferred by
Plumier to one of the tropical species of this genus.

Distribution. Pine-barren swamps, often almost to the exclusion of other
plants, usually in the neighborhood of the coast from southeastern
Virginia (Dismal Swamp) to the valley of the Caloosahatchee River and
the Everglades Keys, Florida, Alabama and Mississippi; extending inland
to the neighborhood of Wilmington, North Carolina, Aiken, South
Carolina, western Georgia (Meriwether County), the interior of the
Florida peninsula and to Autauga, Chilton and Tuscaloosa Counties,

axils of lanceolate acute minute bracts, in cymose clusters in axillary
or subterminal stalked panicles; calyx-tube campanulate, the 6 lobes of
the limb nearly equal, deciduous; stamens of the inner series reduced to
linear staminodes, with minute abortive anthers; filaments inserted on
the tube of the calyx, those of the outer series opposite its exterior
lobes, shorter or sometimes rather longer than the anthers, glabrous or
hirsute, furnished in the third series near the base with two
conspicuous globose stalked yellow glands; anthers oblong, flattened,
4-celled, introrse in the 2 outer series, extrorse, subextrorse, or very

Ocotea with nearly two hundred species is confined principally to the
tropical region of the New World from southern Florida to Brazil and
Peru, with Old World representatives in the Canary Islands, South
Africa, and the Mascarene Islands. One species grows naturally in
Florida.

Ocotea produces hard, strong, durable, beautifully colored wood often
employed in cabinet-making.

The name is derived from the native name of one of the species of
Guiana.

[Illustration: Fig. 324]

Leaves 2'--5' long, 1/2'--1-1/2' wide, unfolding in winter or early in
the spring and continuing to appear as the branches lengthen until late
in the autumn; beginning to fade during the summer, turning to a
beautiful yellow or orange color and falling one by one during their
second season, or often remaining on the branches until the sixth year;
petioles 1/10'--1/5' in length. Flowers appearing in January before the
unfolding of the young leaves, the umbels on peduncles sometimes 1' in
length. Fruit about 1' long, in clusters of 2 or 3, on elongated
thickened pedicels, persistent on the branch after the fruit ripens and
falls late in the autumn; seeds germinating soon after they reach the
ground, the fruit remaining below the surface of the soil and attached
to the young plant until midsummer.

A tree, usually 20 deg.--75 deg., occasionally 100 deg.--175 deg. high, with a trunk
3 deg.--6 deg. in diameter, sometimes tall and straight but usually divided near
the ground into several large diverging stems, stout spreading or rarely
pendulous (var. _pendula_ Redh.) branches forming a broad round-topped
head, and branchlets light green and coated with soft pale pubescence
when they first appear, soon becoming glabrous and yellow-green, and in
their second and third years light brown tinged with red; at high
altitudes, and in southern California much smaller; often reduced to a
large or small shrub, or on bluffs facing the ocean to broad mats of
prostrate stems. Bark 3/4'--1' thick, dark brown tinged with red,
separating on the surface into thin appressed scales. Wood heavy, hard,
strong, close-grained, light rich brown, with thick lighter colored
sapwood of 30--40 layers of annual growth; the most valuable wood
produced in the forests of Pacific North America for the interior finish
of houses and for furniture. The leaves yield by distillation a pungent
volatile oil, and from the fruit a fat containing umbellulic acid has
been obtained.

Distribution. Valley of Coos River, Oregon, southward through the
California coast ranges and along the high western slopes of the Sierra
Nevada to the southern slopes of the San Bernardino Mountains up to
altitudes of 2500 deg.; usually near the banks of water-courses and
sometimes on low hills; common where it can obtain an abundant supply of
water; most abundant and of its largest size in the rich valleys of
southwestern Oregon, forming with the Broad-leaved Maple a considerable
part of the forest growth.

A tree, occasionally 80 deg.--90 deg. high, with a trunk nearly 6 deg. in diameter,
short stout more or less contorted branches spreading almost at right
angles and forming a narrow usually flat-topped head, and slender
branchlets light yellow-green and coated when they first appear with
pale pubescence, becoming glabrous, bright green and lustrous, gradually
turning reddish brown at the end of two or three years; frequently not
more than 40 deg.--50 deg. tall; at the north and in Florida generally smaller

yellow sapwood of 7 or 8 layers of annual growth; largely used for
fence-posts and rails, in the construction of light boats, ox-yokes, and
in cooperage. The roots and especially their bark are a mild aromatic
stimulant, and oil of sassafras, used to perfume soap and other
articles, is distilled from them. Gumbo filet, a powder prepared from
the leaves by the Choctaw Indians of Louisiana, gives flavor and
consistency to gumbo soup. Passing into the var. _albidum_ Blake, with

plano-convex, fleshy; radicle superior, minute.

Of the three species of the genus now known one occurs in southern
Florida and Cuba, and the others in tropical Mexico.

The name of the genus is derived from the name of the tree, Palo
Misanteca at Misantha, near the coast of the state of Vera Cruz where
the type species was discovered.

Liquidambar with about four species is confined to the eastern United
States, southern and central Mexico, Central America, southwestern Asia,
middle and southeastern China, and Formosa. Liquid storax, an opaque
grayish brown resin, is derived from _Liquidambar orientalis_ Mill., a
native of Asia Minor.

Liquidambar from _liquidus_ and _ambar_ in allusion to the fragrant
juices.

                       1. PLATANUS L. Plane-tree.


Characters of the family.

A genus of four or five species of eastern and western North America,
Mexico, Central America, and of southwestern Asia, all resembling each
other except in the form of the lobes of the leaves and the amount of
pubescence on their lower surface, in the pointed or obtuse apex of the
akene, and in the number of heads of pistillate flowers on their
peduncle.

Of the exotic species, the Old World _Platanus acerifolia_ Willd., of
doubtful origin, and often considered a hybrid between _P. orientalis_
L. and the Plane-tree of the eastern United States, is now a common
street tree in the cities of all the countries of temperate Europe, and
is largely used as a street and shade tree in the eastern states and in

Sorbus is widely distributed through the northern and elevated regions
of the northern hemisphere with three or four species in North America
of which one is arborescent, and with many species in eastern Asia and
in Europe. Of the exotic species, _Sorbus Aucuparia_ L., the common
European Mountain Ash, or Rowan-tree, with several of its varieties and
hybrids, is often cultivated as an ornamental tree in Canada and the
northern states and has become sparingly naturalized northward.

_Sorbus_ is the classical name of the Pear or of the Service-tree.

Distribution. Borders of swamps and rocky hillsides; Newfoundland to
Manitoba and southward through the maritime provinces of Canada, Quebec
and Ontario, the elevated portions of the northeastern United States and
the region of the Great Lakes to Minnesota, and on the Appalachian
Mountains from western Pennsylvania and West Virginia to North Carolina
and Tennessee; in North Carolina ascending to altitudes of nearly 6000 deg.;
probably of its largest size on the northern shores of Lakes Huron and
Superior; in the United States, except in New England, more often a
shrub than a tree; on the Appalachian Mountains usually low, with
narrower leaflets and smaller fruit than northward.

Often cultivated in Canada and the northeastern States for the beauty of
its fruit and the brilliancy of its autumn foliage. Of its forms the
most distinct is

Leaves 4'--6' long, with 7--13 oblong-oval to ovate-lanceolate leaflets
blunt and rounded, abruptly short-pointed or acuminate at apex,
pubescent below as they unfold, at maturity glabrous, dark bluish green
on the upper surface and pale on the lower surface; petioles stout,
usually red 1-1/2'--2' in length. Flowers 1/4' in diameter, in rather
narrower clusters, appearing eight to ten days later than those of the

A tree, occasionally 30 deg. high, with a trunk sometimes a foot in
diameter, and spreading branches forming a round-topped handsome head.

Distribution. Coast of Labrador to the northern shores of Lake Superior
and Minnesota, southward to the mountains of northern New Hampshire,
Vermont, and New York. Distinct in its extreme forms but connected with
_Sorbus americana_ by intermediate forms.

This variety of _Sorbus americana_, perhaps the most beautiful of the
genus when the large and brilliant fruits cover the branches in autumn
and early winter, occasionally finds a place in the gardens of eastern
Canada and the northern states.

[Illustration: Fig. 349]

Leaves appearing with the flowers in early summer, 3'--4' long,
1'--1-1/2' wide, usually persistent during at least two winters;
petioles 1/2'--2/3' in length. Flowers opening from June to August in
clusters 4'--6' across and often more or less hidden by young lateral
branchlets rising above them. Fruit ripening in November and December,
mealy, astringent and acid, scarlet or rarely yellow, 1/3' long,
remaining on the branches until late in the winter.

A tree, sometimes 30 deg. high, with a straight trunk 12'--18' in diameter,
dividing a few feet above the ground into many erect branches forming a
handsome narrow round-topped head, and slender branchlets covered at
first with pale pubescence, in their first winter dark red and slightly
puberulous, ultimately becoming darker and glabrous. Winter-buds 1/4'
long. Bark 1/2'--2/3' thick, light gray, with a generally smooth surface
roughened by obscure reticulate ridges. Wood very heavy, hard,
close-grained, dark red-brown, with thin lighter colored sapwood of 7 or
8 layers of annual growth. The fruit-covered branches are gathered in
large quantities and used in California in Christmas decorations.

Distribution. Usually in the neighborhood of streams or on dry hills and
especially on their northern slopes, and often on steep sea-cliffs;
California: coast region from Mendocino County to Lower California; most
common and of its largest size on the islands off the California coast;
on the foothills of the Sierra Nevada and on the San Bernardino
Mountains up to altitudes of 2000 deg. above the sea and usually shrubby;
very abundant and forming groves of considerable extent on the island of
Santa Catalina.

Occasionally cultivated as an ornamental plant in California, and rarely
in the countries of southern Europe.

Trees or shrubs, with scaly bark, slender terete branchlets, acute or
acuminate buds, with imbricated scales, those of the inner rows
accrescent and bright-colored, and fibrous roots. Leaves alternate,
conduplicate in the bud, simple, entire or serrate, penniveined,
petiolate, deciduous; stipules free from the petioles, linear,
elongated, rose color, caducous. Flowers in erect or terminal racemes,
on slender bibracteolate pedicels developed from the axils of lanceolate
acuminate pink deciduous bracts; calyx-tube campanulate or urceolate,
the lobes acute or acuminate, recurved, persistent on the fruit; disk
green, entire or crenulate, nectariferous; petals white, obovate-oblong,
spatulate or ligulate, rounded, acute or truncate at apex, gradually
contracted below into a short slender claw; stamens usually 20, inserted
in 3 rows, those of the outer row opposite the petals; filaments
subulate, persistent on the fruit, anthers oblong; ovary inferior or
superior, more or less adnate to the calyx-tube, the summit glabrous or
tomentose, 5-celled, each cell incompletely divided by a false
partition; styles 2--5, connate below, spreading and dilated above into
a broad truncate stigma; ovules 2 in each cell, erect; micropyle
inferior. Fruit subglobose or pyriform, dark blue or bluish black, often
covered with a glaucous bloom, open at the summit, the cavity surrounded
by the lobes of the calyx and the remnants of the filaments; flesh
sweet, dry or juicy; carpels membranaceous, free or connate, glabrous,
or villose at apex. Seeds 10 or often 5 by the abortion of 1 of the
ovules in each cell, ovoid-ellipsoid; seed-coat coriaceous, dark
chestnut-brown, mucilaginous; embryo filling the cavity of the seed;
cotyledons plano-convex; radicle inferior.

Amelanchier is widely distributed with many species through the
temperate, northern and mountainous regions of eastern and western North
America; it occurs with one species in southern Europe, northern Africa
and southwestern Asia, and with another in central and western China and
Japan. Only three species, all North American, attain the habit and size
of trees. The fruit of nearly all the species is more or less succulent,
and several are cultivated in gardens for the beauty of their early and
conspicuous flowers, and occasionally for their fruit. The name is of
doubtful origin.

unarmed or armed with stout or slender short or elongated axillary
simple or branched spines generally similar in color to that of the
branches or trunk on which they grow, often bearing while young linear
elongated caducous bracts, and usually producing at their base one or
rarely two buds often developing the following year into a branch, a
leaf, or a cluster of flowers, or sometimes lengthening into a leafy
branch. Winter-buds small, globose or subglobose, covered by numerous
imbricated scales, the outer rounded and obtuse at apex, bright
chestnut-brown and lustrous, the inner accrescent, green or rose color,

stalked and mostly persistent until autumn. Flowers pedicellate, in few
or many-flowered simple or compound cymose corymbs terminal on short
lateral leafy branchlets, with linear usually bright-colored often
glandular caducous bracts and bractlets leaving prominent gland-like
scars, the lower branches of compound corymbs usually from the axils of
upper leaves; branches of the inflorescence mostly 3-flowered, the
central flower opening before the others; calyx-tube usually obconic,
5-lobed, the lobes acute or acuminate and usually gland-tipped, rarely
foliaceous, glandular-serrate or entire, green or reddish toward the
apex, reflexed after the flowers open, persistent and often enlarged on

sulcate, concave or somewhat convex; petals imbricated in the bud,
orbicular, entire or somewhat erose or rarely toothed at apex, white or
rarely rose color, spreading, soon deciduous; stamens often variable in
number in the same species by imperfect development, but normally 5 in 1
row and alternate with the petals, or 10 in 5 pairs in 1 row alternate
with the petals, or 15 in 2 rows, those of the outer row in 5 pairs
opposite the sepals and alternate with and rather longer than those of
the inner row, or 20 in 3 rows, those of the inner row shorter and
alternate with those of the 2d row, or 25 in 4 rows, those of the 4th
row alternate with those of the 3d row; filaments broad at base,
subulate, incurved, often persistent on the fruit; anthers pale yellow
to nearly white, or pink to light or dark rose color or purple; ovary
composed of 1--5 carpels inserted in the bottom of the calyx-tube and
united with it; styles free, with dilated truncate stigmas, persistent
on the mature carpels; ovules ascending; raphe dorsal; micropyle
inferior. Fruit subglobose, ovoid or short-oblong, scarlet,
orange-colored, red, yellow, blue, or black, generally open and concave
at apex; flesh usually dry and mealy; nutlets 1--5; united below, more
or less free and slightly spreading above the middle, thick-walled,
rounded, acute, or acuminate at apex, full and rounded or narrowed at
base, rounded or conspicuously ridged and grooved on the back,
flattened, or nearly round when only 1, their ventral faces plane or
plano-convex, in some species penetrated by longitudinal cavities or
hollows, and marked by a more or less conspicuous hypostyle sometimes
extending to below the middle or nearly to the base of the nutlet. Seed
solitary by abortion, erect, compressed, acute, with a membranaceous
light chestnut-brown coat; embryo filling the cavity of the seed;
cotyledons plano-convex, radicle short, inferior.

Crataegus is most abundant in eastern North America, where it is
distributed from Newfoundland to the mountains of northern Mexico, and
is represented by a large number of arborescent and shrubby species. A
few species occur in the Rocky Mountains and Pacific-coast regions, and
in China, Japan, Siberia, central and southwestern Asia, and in Europe.
The genus is still very imperfectly known in North America, and in the
absence of sufficient information concerning them several arborescent
species are necessarily excluded from the following enumeration. The
beautiful and abundant flowers and showy fruits make many of the species
desirable ornaments of parks and gardens, and several are cultivated. Of
exotic species, the Old World _Crataegus Oxyacantha_ L., and _C.
monogyna_ Jacq., early introduced into the United States as hedge
plants, have now become naturalized in many places in the northeastern
and middle states. Crataegus produces heavy hard tough close-grained
red-brown heartwood and thick lighter colored usually pale sapwood;
useful for the handles of tools, mallets, and other small articles.

The number of the stamens, although it differs on the same species
within certain usually constant limits, and the color of the anthers,
which appears to be specifically constant with one exception, afford the
most satisfactory characters for distinguishing the species in the
different groups.

_Crataegus_, from {kratos}, is in reference to the strength of the wood
of these trees.

green and lustrous above, pale below, reticulate-venulose, 1'--4' long,
and 1/4'--1' wide, with a slender midrib, and primary veins within the
parenchyma; turning bright orange and scarlet in the autumn before
falling; petioles stout, 1/2'--3/4' in length; leaves at the end of
vigorous shoots acute or acuminate, coarsely serrate, often 5'--6' long.
Flowers 2/3' in diameter, on slender pedicels, in many-flowered glabrous
corymbs; calyx-tube narrowly obconic, glabrous, the lobes
linear-lanceolate, entire or minutely glandular-serrate; stamens 10;
anthers rose color; styles usually 2, surrounded at base by tufts of
pale hairs. Fruit ripening late in October and persistent on the
branches until spring, short-oblong to subglobose, 1/2' long, dull red
often covered with a glaucous bloom; calyx little enlarged; nutlets
usually 2, full and rounded at the ends, with a high rounded grooved

smaller bright red fruit, is not rare in eastern Pennsylvania and
northern Delaware; a form, var. _salicifolia_ Ait., cultivated in
European gardens, but not known in a wild state, with thinner narrower
and more elongated lanceolate or oblanceolate leaves, should also
probably be referred to this species. A form, var. _oblongata_ Sarg.,
with rather brighter colored oblong fruit often 1' long, and nutlets
acute at the ends, is not rare near Wilmington, Delaware, and at Durham,
Bucks County, Pennsylvania. A form, var. _capillata_ Sarg., with thinner

1823), an English merchant who traveled in Mexico and Peru and sent
plants to England.

Cercocarpus is confined to the dry interior and mountainous regions of
North America. Twenty-one species, often of doubtful value, have been
distinguished; seventeen are credited to the territory of the United
States and the others to Mexico. The heavy hard brittle wood of all the
species makes valuable fuel and is occasionally used in the manufacture
of small articles for domestic and industrial use.

The generic name, from {kerkos} and {karpos}, refers to the peculiar
long-tailed fruit.

Prunus with about one hundred and twenty species is generally
distributed over the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, and
is abundant in North America, eastern Asia, western and central Asia and
central Europe, ranging southward in the New World into tropical
America, and to southern Asia in the Old World. Of the twenty-five or
thirty species which occur in the United States, twenty-two are
arborescent in habit. Several of the species bear fruits which are
important articles of human food; many contain in the seeds and leaves
hydrocyanic acid, to which is due their peculiar odor, and the fruit of
some of the species is used to flavor cordials. The wood of Prunus is
close-grained, solid, and durable, and a few of the species are
important timber-trees.

_Prunus_ is the classical name of the Plum-tree.

Distribution. Usually in rich soil; southern Illinois (Alexander,
Gallatin, Pope, Johnson and Richland Counties); southwestern Kentucky;
central Tennessee; northern Mississippi; central Missouri to
southeastern Kansas, and through Arkansas to eastern Oklahoma, western
Louisiana (Natchitoches and Lincoln Parishes), and northern Texas (west

slightly revolute margins, or rarely remotely spinulose-serrate,
glabrous, coriaceous, dark green and lustrous on the upper surface,
paler on the lower surface, 2'--4-1/2' long and 3/4'--1-1/2' wide, and
obscurely veined, with a narrow pale midrib; persistent until their
second year; petioles stout, broad, orange-colored; stipules foliaceous,
lanceolate, acuminate. Flowers appearing from February to April, on
slender pedicels about 1/2' long, from the axils of long-acuminate
scarious red-tipped bracts, in dense racemes shorter than leaves;
calyx-tube narrow-obconic, the lobes small, thin, rounded, undulate on
the margins, reflexed after the flowers open, deciduous; petals
boat-shaped, minute, cream-colored; stamens exserted, orange-colored,
with glabrous filaments and large pale anthers; ovary gradually narrowed

                          11. CHRYSOBALANUS L.


Trees or shrubs, with stout branchlets covered with pale lenticels, and
fibrous roots. Leaves alternate, entire, coriaceous, short-petiolate,
persistent; stipules minute, deciduous. Flowers perfect,
short-pedicellate, small, creamy white, in axillary or terminal
dichotomously branched slender canescent cymes, with conspicuous
deciduous bracts; calyx turbinate-campanulate, 5-lobed, the lobes
imbricated in the bud, without bracts, deciduous; disk thin, adnate to
the calyx-tube; petals 5, alternate with the lobes of the calyx,
spatulate, deciduous; stamens (in the arborescent species) indefinite in
a single continuous series, inserted with the petals on the margin of
the disk; filaments filiform, hairy, free or slightly united at base;
anthers ovoid, ovary sessile in the bottom of the calyx-tube, pubescent
or glabrous, 1-celled; style rising from the base of the ovary,
filiform, terminated by a minute truncate stigma; ovules 2, collateral,
ascending; raphe dorsal; the micropyle inferior. Fruit a fleshy 1-seeded
drupe with pulpy flesh, a coriaceous or crustaceous stone 5 or 6-angled
toward the base and imperfectly 5 or 6-valved, the valves
reticulate-veined. Seed erect; seed-coat chartaceous, light brown;
embryo filling the cavity of the seed; cotyledons thick and fleshy;
radicle inferior, very short.

Chrysobalanus is represented in the south Atlantic states by a shrubby
species confined to the coast region from Georgia to Alabama, and by an
arborescent species, an inhabitant of the shores of southern Florida,
and widely distributed through the maritime regions of tropical America,
and found in various forms on the coast of western tropical Africa. The
insipid fruit of the arborescent species is eaten by negroes; the seeds
contain a considerable quantity of oil; and the astringent bark, leaves
and roots have been used in medicine.

The generic name is from {chrysos} and {balanos}, in allusion to the
supposed golden fruit of one of the species.

                         1. PITHECOLOBIUM Mart.


Trees or shrubs, with slender branches armed with the persistent
spinescent stipules. Leaves petiolate, bipinnate, the pinnae
few-foliolate, their rachis generally marked by numerous glands between
the pinnae and between the leaflets. Flowers perfect or polygamous, from
the axils of minute bracts, in pedunculate globose heads or oblong
cylindric spikes, their peduncles in terminal panicles or axillary
fascicles; calyx campanulate, short-toothed; corolla funnel-shaped, the
petals as many as the teeth of the calyx, joined for more than half
their length; stamens numerous, united at base into a tube free from the
corolla; anthers minute, versatile; ovary stipitate, contracted into a
slender filiform style, with a minute terminal stigma. Legume
compressed, 2-valved, dehiscent, the valves continuous or interrupted
within. Seeds compressed, suspended transversely; funicle filiform or
expanded into a fleshy aril; hilum near the base of the seed; seed-coat
thin or thick, marked on each of the 2 surfaces of the seed by a faint
oval ring or oblong depression; embryo filling the cavity of the seed;
the radicle included or slightly exserted.

Pithecolobium with more than a hundred species is widely distributed
through the tropical and subtropical regions of the two worlds, and is
most abundant in tropical America. Of the four species found within the
territory of the United States three are arborescent.

The generic name, from {pithex} and {ellobion}, relates to the contorted
fruit of some of the species.

Florida and the Bahama Islands, the West Indies, Mexico and Lower
California, to Central America and Bolivia. Several of the species
produce valuable timber.

The generic name, from {lysis} and {loma}, refers to the separation of
the valves from the margins of the legume.

                            3. ACACIA Adans.


Trees or shrubs, with slender branches armed with spinescent stipules or
infrastipular spines. Leaves alternate on young branchlets and fascicled
in earlier axils, bipinnate, with usually small leaflets, persistent.
Flowers perfect or polygamous, small, in the axils of minute linear
bractlets more or less dilated and often peltate at apex, in globose
heads or cylindric spikes on axillary solitary or fascicled peduncles;
calyx campanulate, 5 or 6-toothed; petals as many as the divisions of

slightly exserted.

Acacia with more than four hundred species is widely distributed through
Australia, where it is most largely represented, tropical and southern
Africa, northern Africa, southwestern China, the warmer regions of
southern Asia, the islands of the south Pacific, tropical and temperate
South America, the West Indies, Central America and Mexico to the
southwestern boundaries of the United States where ten or twelve species
occur; of these five are arborescent. Acacia is astringent, and many
species yield valuable tan bark. Gum arabic is produced by different Old
World species; many of the species yield hard heavy durable wood, and
some of the Australian Acacias are large and valuable timber-trees. Many
species are cultivated for their graceful foliage and handsome fragrant
flowers.

The generic name, from {akakia}, relates to the spines with which the
branches are usually armed.

The generic name is from {kerkis}, the Greek name of the European
species, from a fancied resemblance of the fruit to the weaver's
implement of that name.

Sophora is scattered over the warmer parts of the two hemispheres, with
about twenty species of trees, shrubs or herbs; of the six North
American species two are small trees. Several of the species produce
valuable wood, and from the pods and flower-buds of the Chinese _Sophora
japonica_ L., a dye is obtained used to dye white cloth yellow and blue
cloth green. This tree is often cultivated as an ornament of parks and
gardens in northern China, Japan, the eastern United States, and in
western, central, and southern Europe.

The generic name is from _Sophera_, the Arabic name of some tree with
pea-shaped flowers.

Guaiacum is confined to the New World, and is distributed from southern
Florida through the Antilles, Mexico, and Central America to the Andes
of Peru. Seven or eight species are distinguished.

Guaiacum produces heavy close-grained wood, the cells of the heartwood
filled with dark-colored resin. The lignum-vitae of commerce, largely
used for the sheaths of ship-blocks, mallets, skittle-balls, ten-pin
balls, etc., is produced principally by _Guaiacum officinale_ L., of the
Antilles and South America, and by _Guaiacum sanctum_ L. Guaiacum resin
is a stimulating diaphoretic sometimes used in the treatment of gout and
rheumatism.

The generic name is from the Carib Guaiaco or Guayacon, the aboriginal
name of the Lignum-vitae.

Xanthoxylum is widely distributed through tropical and extratropical
regions and is most abundant in tropical America. It is represented in
North America by one shrub and by four arborescent species of the
southern states. The resin contained in the bark, especially in that of
the roots, is a powerful stimulant and tonic occasionally used in
medicine.

[Illustration: Fig. 582]

Leaves rarely 5-foliolate on vigorous shoots; leaflets sessile, ovate or
oblong, pointed, the terminal leaflet generally larger and more
gradually contracted at base than the others, entire or finely serrate,
covered at first with short close pubescence, becoming glabrous and
rather coriaceous at maturity, dark green and lustrous above, pale
below, 4'--6' long, 2-1/2'--3' wide, with a prominent midrib and primary
veins; turning clear yellow in the autumn before falling; petioles
stout, thickened at base, 2-1/2'--3' in length. Flowers appearing in
early spring on slender pubescent pedicels 1'--1-1/2' long, the
pistillate and staminate flowers produced together, the staminate
usually less numerous and falling soon after the opening of the
anther-cells; calyx and petals pubescent; ovary puberulous. Fruit with a
thin almost orbicular sometimes slightly obovate wing, nearly 1' across,
on a long slender reflexed pedicel, in dense drooping clusters remaining
on the branches through the winter; seeds 1/3' long, dark red-brown.

A round-headed tree, rarely 20 deg.--25 deg. high, with a straight slender trunk
6'--8' in diameter, small spreading or erect branches, and slender
branchlets covered at first with short fine pubescence, becoming
glabrous, dark brown and lustrous, and marked by wart-like excrescences
and by the conspicuous leaf-scars; more often a low spreading shrub.
Winter-buds depressed, nearly round, pale or almost white. Wood heavy,
hard, close-grained, yellow-brown, with thin hardly distinguishable
sapwood of 6--8 layers of annual growth. The bitter bark of the roots is
sometimes used in the form of tinctures and fluid extracts as a tonic,
and the fruit is occasionally employed domestically as a substitute for
hops in brewing beer.

Distribution. Generally on rocky slopes near the borders of the forest,
often in the shade of other trees; Long Island, New York, Pennsylvania,
and westward through southwestern Ontario (Point Pelee) and southern
Michigan to southern Iowa, southeastern Nebraska, and southward to
Georgia, Alabama, eastern Louisiana and through Missouri and Arkansas to
southeastern Kansas, eastern Oklahoma and eastern Texas. A form with
leaflets soft-pubescent on the lower surface (var. _mollis_ T. & G.)
occurs in the south Atlantic states from North Carolina to Florida.

Often planted as an ornament of parks and gardens.




                              4. AMYRIS L.


Glabrous glandular-punctate trees or shrubs, with balsamic resinous
juices. Leaves opposite or rarely opposite and alternate, 3-foliolate,
without stipules, persistent; leaflets opposite, petiolulate, entire or
crenate. Flowers white, minute, on slender bibracteolate pedicels,
usually in 3-flowered corymbs in terminal or axillary branched panicles;
calyx 4-toothed, persistent; petals 4, hypogynous, much larger than the
calyx-lobes, spreading at maturity; disk of the staminate flower
inconspicuous, that of the pistillate and perfect flowers thickened and
pulvinate; stamens 8, hypogynous, opposite and alternate with the
petals; filaments filiform, exserted; anthers ovoid, attached on the
back below the middle; ovary ellipsoid or ovoid, 1-celled, rudimentary
in the staminate flower; style short, terminal, or wanting; stigma
capitate; ovules collateral, suspended near the apex of the ovary,
anatropous. Fruit a globose or ovoid aromatic drupe; stone 1-seeded by
abortion, chartaceous. Seed pendulous, without albumen; seed-coat
membranaceous; cotyledons plano-convex, fleshy, glandular-punctate.

Amyris is confined to tropical America and northern Mexico. Of the
twelve or fourteen species which have been distinguished two extend into
the territory of the United States; one of these is a small West Indian
tree common on the shores of southern Florida, and the other, _Amyris
parvifolia_ A. Gray, a Mexican shrub, grows in Texas near Corpus
Christi, Neuces County, and near the mouth of the Rio Grande. Amyris is
fragrant and yields a balsamic aromatic and stimulant resin, and heavy
hard close-grained wood valuable as fuel and sometimes used in
cabinet-making.

The generic name, from {myrrha}, relates to the balsamic properties of
the plants of this genus.


                   1. Amyris elemifera L. Torch Wood.

[Illustration: Fig. 583]

Leaves 3-foliolate, with slender petioles 1'--1-1/2' long, and
broad-ovate or rounded obtuse acute or acuminate leaflets cuneate at

remotely crenulate, coriaceous, lustrous, dark yellow-green,
conspicuously reticulate-veined, covered below with minute glandular
dots, 1'--2-1/2' long, with slender petiolules, that of the terminal
leaflet often 1' or more long and twice as long as those of the lateral
leaflets. Flowers in terminal pedunculate or nearly sessile panicles

spring, ovoid, often nearly 1/2' long, black covered with a glaucous
bloom, with thin flesh filled with an aromatic oil and of rather
agreeable flavor.

A slender tree, 40 deg.--50 deg. high, with a trunk sometimes, although rarely,
a foot in diameter, and slender terete branchlets covered with wart-like
excrescences, at first light brown, becoming gray during their second
season. Bark of the trunk thin, gray-brown, slightly furrowed and broken
into short appressed scales. Winter-buds acute, flattened, 1/8' long,
with broad-ovate scales slightly keeled on the back. Wood heavy,
exceedingly hard, strong, close-grained, very resinous, extremely
durable, light orange color, with thin rather lighter colored sapwood of
12--15 layers of annual growth; often used as fuel.

Distribution. Florida, Mosquito Inlet, Volusia County, to the southern
keys; common in the immediate neighborhood of the coast to the rich
hummocks of the interior, and of its largest size on Umbrella Key; on
the Bahama Islands and on many of the Antilles.




                          XXVII. SIMAROUBACEAE.


Trees or shrubs, with bitter juice. Leaves alternate, pinnate,

conduplicate in the bud, entire, coriaceous, glabrous or slightly
puberulous below, feather-veined. Flowers in elongated widely branched
axillary and terminal panicles; disk cup-shaped, depressed in the
sterile flower, pubescent; stamens as long as the petals, in the
pistillate flower reduced to minute scales; filaments free, filiform,
thickened toward the base, inserted on the back of a minute ciliate

back below the middle, 2-celled, the cells opening longitudinally; ovary
sessile on the disk, deeply lobed, the lobes opposite the petals,
rudimentary, lobulate, minute or wanting in the staminate flower; styles
united into a short column, with a 3--5-lobed spreading stigma. Fruit
composed of 1--5 sessile spreading drupes; flesh thin; stone
crustaceous. Seeds inverse, without albumen; seed-coat membranaceous;
cotyledons plano-convex, fleshy, the radicle very short, partly included
between the cotyledons, superior.

Simarouba with four species is confined to tropical America, and is
distributed from the coast of southern Florida to Brazil and Guatemala.
The plants of this genus contain a small amount of resin, a volatile
oil, and an exceedingly bitter principle, quasin, with tonic properties.

The generic name is formed from Simarouba, the Carib name of one of the
species.

ripe; seeds papillose, orange-brown, about 3/4' long.

A round-headed tree, growing occasionally in Florida to the height of
50 deg., with a straight trunk 18'--20' in diameter, slender spreading
branches, and stout glabrous branchlets pale green when they first
appear, becoming light brown before the end of the summer, rugose and
conspicuously marked during their second season by the large oval
leaf-scars. Bark of the trunk 1/2'--3/4' thick, light red-brown and
broken on the surface into broad thick appressed scales. Wood light,

oblong-obovoid, 2 or by abortion 1-celled, the cells 1-seeded. Seeds
filling the cavity of the cell, plano-convex, pendulous from the apex of
the cell; hilum minute, apical, the raphe conspicuous; testa
membranaceous, adherent to the exalbuminous undivided embryo; radicle
superior, inconspicuous.

Picramnia, with about twenty species, is confined to the tropical and
subtropical regions of the New World, one species extending into
southern Florida. The bitter principle in the plants of this genus makes
the bark of several of them useful in domestic remedies.

The generic name, from {pikros} and {thamnos}, is in reference to this
bitter principle.

none; embryo oblong-compressed; cotyledons flat; radicle inferior, very
short.

An anomalous genus, by several authors doubtfully referred to
Sapindaceae, but chiefly on account of its bitter properties now placed
in Simaroubaceae. It consists of three species; of these the widely
distributed _Alvaradoa amorphoides_ Liebmann, the type of the genus,
occurs in southern Florida. The other species appear to be confined to
the islands of Jamaica and Cuba.

[Illustration: Fig. 587]

Leaves confined to the end of the branchlets, 6'--8' long, 4'--8' wide,
with a long slender petiole, and usually 5, rarely 3 or 7 leaflets
coriaceous at maturity, oblong-ovate, oblique at base, contracted at
apex into a long or short point, 2-1/2'--3' long, 1-1/2'--2' broad, with
stout petiolules often 1/2' long; deciduous in early winter or
occasionally persistent until the following spring. Flowers about 3/16'
in diameter, appearing before the leaves or as they unfold, on slender
pedicels 1/3'--1/2' long, in slender raceme-like panicles, those of the
staminate plant 4'--5' long or nearly twice as long as those of the
pistillate plant; calyx-lobes and petals 5; petals ovate-lanceolate,
acute, revolute on the margins, and nearly four times as long as the
slender acute calyx-lobes; stamens of the staminate flower as long as
the petals and in the pistillate flower not more than half as long, with
smaller often effete anthers. Fruit in short raceme-like clusters,
1/4'--1/3' long, 3-angled, with a thick dark red outer coat, separating

triangular nutlets rounded at base, pointed at apex, and covered with a
thin membranaceous light pink coat; seeds 1 or 2, triangular, rose
color.

A glabrous tree, 50 deg.--60 deg. high, with a trunk 2-1/2 deg.--3 deg. in diameter,
massive primary branches spreading nearly at right angles, and stout
terete branchlets light gray during their first season, becoming during
their second year reddish brown, covered with lenticular spots and
conspicuously marked by large elevated obcordate yellow leaf-scars.
Winter-buds short, rounded, obtuse, with broad-ovate dark red scales
slightly scarious on the margins. Bark of the trunk and large branches

red-brown scales exposing in falling the dark red-brown or gray inner
bark. Wood spongy, very light, exceedingly soft and weak, light brown,
with thick sapwood, soon becoming discolored by decay. Pieces of the
trunk and large branches set in the ground soon produce roots and grow
rapidly into large trees. The aromatic resin obtained by incisions cut
in the trunk was formerly used in the treatment of gout, and in the West
Indies is manufactured into varnish. An infusion of the leaves is
sometimes used in Florida as a substitute for tea.

Distribution. Florida, from Cape Canaveral to the southern keys, and on
the west coast from Terra Ceia Island, Manatee County, Plagida, De Sota
County, and Gasparilla Island southward; one of the largest and most
common of the south Florida trees, and the only one which sheds its
foliage during the autumn and winter; on most of the West Indian
islands, in tropical Mexico, Guatemala, New Granada, and Venezuela.

Trees, with heavy dark red wood. Leaves abruptly pinnate, glabrous,
long-petiolate, persistent; leaflets opposite, petiolulate, usually
oblique at base. Flowers small, in axillary or subterminal panicles
produced near the end of the branches; calyx minute; petals spreading;
staminal tube urn-shaped, connate with the petals, 10-lobed, the lobes
convolute in the bud; anthers 10, fixed by the back below the sinuses of
the staminal tube, included; ovary ovoid, 5-celled, the cells opposite
the petals; style erect, longer than the tube of the stamens; stigma
discoid, 5-rayed. Fruit a 5-celled 5-valved capsule septicidally
dehiscent from the base, the valves separating from a persistent
5-angled axis thickened toward the apex and 5-winged toward the base.
Seeds suspended from near the summit of the axis, imbricated in 2 ranks,
compressed, emarginate, produced above into a long membranaceous wing
with the hilum at its apex and transversed by the raphe; embryo
transverse; cotyledons conferruminate with each other and with the thin
fleshy albumen; radicle short, papillaeform.

Swietenia with five species is confined to tropical America from
southern Florida where one species occurs, to Venezuela, western and
southwestern Mexico, and the east coast of Central America.

The generic name is in honor of Baron von Swieten (1700--1772), the
distinguished Dutch physician, founder of the Botanic Garden and of the
Medical School at Vienna.

adjacent to the Mediterranean, and northern and central China, with one
species growing on the northern banks of the Rio Grande in Texas.

The Pistacio-nuts of commerce, the green or yellow seeds of P. _vera_ L.
are largely used in confectionery, and some of the species are valued
for the decoration of parks and gardens.

Pistacia from {pist} and {akeomai}, in reference to the healing
properties of its resinous exudations.

                               4. RHUS L.


Trees or shrubs, with pithy branchlets, fleshy roots, and milky
sometimes caustic or watery juice. Leaves unequally pinnate, or rarely
simple. Flowers mostly dioecious, rarely polygamous, white or greenish
white, in more or less compound axillary or terminal panicles, the
staminate and pistillate usually produced on separate plants;
calyx-lobes united at base only, generally persistent; disk surrounding
the base of the free ovary, coherent with the base of the calyx; petals
longer than the calyx-lobes, inserted under the margin of the disk,
opposite its lobes, deciduous; stamens 5, inserted on the margin of the
disk alternate with the petals; filaments longer than the anthers; ovary
ovoid or subglobose, sessile; styles 3, terminal, free or slightly
connate at base, rising from the centre of the ovary. Fruit usually
globose, smooth or covered with hairs; outer coat thin and dry, more or
less resinous; stone crustaceous or bony. Seed ovoid or reniform,
commonly transverse; cotyledons foliaceous, generally transverse;
radicle long, uncinate, laterally accumbent.

Rhus is widely distributed, with more than one hundred species, in the
extra-tropical regions of the northern and southern hemispheres. In
North America the genus is widely and generally distributed from Canada
to southern Mexico and from the shores of the Atlantic to those of the
Pacific Ocean, with sixteen or seventeen species within the territory of
the United States. Of these, four obtain the habit of small trees. The
acrid poisonous juice of _Rhus vernicifera_ DC., of China, furnishes the
black varnish used in China and Japan in the manufacture of lacquer, and
other species are valued for the tannin contained in their leaves or for
the wax obtained from their fruit.

The name of the genus is from {Rhous}, the classical name of the
European Sumach.

valley of the Rio Grande and to southeastern New Mexico, often forming
thickets on river bluffs or on the banks of small streams, and
distinguished by its narrow acute often falcate leaflets and by its
larger inflorescence and fruit. A tree sometimes 25 deg.--30 deg. high, with a
trunk occasionally 8' in diameter, covered by dark gray bark marked by
lenticular excrescences. The flowers appear in July and August and the

striate. Wood light, soft, coarse-grained, light yellow streaked with
brown, with lighter colored sapwood.

Distribution. Wet swamps often inundated during a portion of the year;
northern New England to northern Florida and southern Alabama, and
westward to Ontario and southeastern Minnesota, western Louisiana and
the valley of the Neches River (San Augustine County) eastern Texas;
common and one of the most dangerous plants of the North American flora.
An infusion of the young branches and leaves is employed in homoeopathic

                               1. ILEX L.


Characters of the family.

Ilex with about one hundred and seventy-five species is found in all
tropical and temperate regions of the world with the exception of
western North America, Australia, New Zealand, Tasmania, and New Guinea,
the largest number of species occurring in Brazil and Guiana. Of the
thirteen species which inhabit eastern North America, six are trees.
Ilex contains a bitter principle, ilicin, and possesses tonic
properties. _Ilex paraguariensis_ St. Hilaire, of South America,
furnishes the mate or Paraguay tea, and is the most useful of the
species. The European _Ilex Aquifolium_ L. is a favorite garden plant,
and is sometimes planted in the middle, southern, and Pacific United
States.

_Ilex_ is the classical name of the Evergreen Oak of southern Europe.

                             1. AESCULUS L.


Characters of the family; leaves 5--9-foliolate.

Aesculus with fifteen or sixteen species, is represented in the floras
of the three continents of the northern hemisphere and is most abundant
in the southeastern United States. It produces soft straight-grained
light-colored wood and bitter and astringent bark. The seeds contain a
bitter principle, aesculin. _Aesculus Hippocastanum_ L., of the
mountains of Greece, the common Horsechestnut of gardens, is largely
planted as an ornamental tree in all countries with temperate climates,
and now occasionally grows spontaneously in the eastern states.

The generic name is the classical name of an Oak-tree.

A shrubby form (var. _micrantha_ Sarg.) with flowers not more than 1/2'
long near Fulton, Hempstead County, Arkansas. In southern Missouri,
Arkansas and probably Oklahoma _Aesculus glabra_ is replaced by the var.
_leucodermis_ Sarg. with glabrous leaves pale green or glaucescent

the smooth pale nearly white bark of the trunk and large branches,
becoming on old trunks light brown and separating into oblong flakes,
and by its later flowers; the var. _pallida_ in Iowa, Missouri and
Arkansas; the var. _Buckleyi_ in Jackson County, Missouri, eastern
Kansas, Ohio and Mississippi.

The Ohio Buckeye is occasionally cultivated as an ornamental plant in
the eastern United States and Europe; hardy as far north as eastern
Massachusetts.

x _Aesculus Bushii_ Schn., probably a hybrid of _Aesculus discolor_ var.
_mollis_ Sarg. and _Aesculus glabra_ var. _leucodermis_ Sarg., has been
found in the neighborhood of Fulton, Hempstead County, Arkansas; and
what is evidently a hybrid of _Aesculus discolor_ var. _mollis_ and the
typical form of _Aesculus glabra_ occurs near Starkville, Oktibbeha
County, Mississippi.

x _Aesculus mississippiensis_ Sarg., a probable hybrid between _Aesculus
glabra_ and _Aesculus Pavia_ with characters intermediate between those
of its supposed parents, occurs near Brookville, Noxubee County,
Mississippi. The mingling of a species of the Octandrae and of the

                       1. SAPINDUS L. Soapberry.


Trees or shrubs, with terete branches, without a terminal bud, marked by
large obcordate leaf-scars showing the ends of 3 equidistant
fibro-vascular bundles, small globose axillary buds often superposed in
pairs, the upper bud the larger, and thick fleshy roots. Leaves equally
or rarely unequally pinnate. Flowers regular, minute,
polygamo-dioecious, on short pedicels from the axils of minute deciduous
bracts, in ample axillary or terminal panicles; sepals 4 or 5, unequal,
slightly united at base; petals 4 or 5, equal, alternate with the
sepals, inserted under the thick edge of the annular fleshy entire
crenately lobed disk, unguiculate, naked or furnished at the summit of
the claw on the inside with a 2-cleft scale, deciduous; stamens usually
8 or 10, inserted on the disk immediately under the ovary, equal;
filaments subulate or filiform, often pilose, exserted in the staminate,
much shorter in the pistillate flower; anthers oblong, attached near the
base; pistils 2 or 3, united; ovary sessile, entire or 2--4-lobed,
2--4-celled, narrowed into a short columnar style, rudimentary in the
staminate flower; stigma 2--4-lobed, the lobes spreading; ovule solitary
in each cell, ascending from below the inner angle of the cell; raphe
ventral; micropyle inferior. Fruit baccate, coriaceous, 1--3-seeded,
usually formed of 1 globose coriaceous carpel, with the rudiments of the
others remaining at its base, or of 2 or sometimes 3 carpels more or
less connate by their base and then 2--3-lobed. Seed solitary in each
carpel, obovoid or globose; seed-coat bony, smooth, black or dark brown;
tegmen membranaceous or fleshy; hilum oblong, surrounded by an ariloid
tuft of long pale silky hairs; embryo incurved or straight; cotyledons
thick and fleshy, incumbent; radicle very short, inferior, near the
hilum.

Sapindus is widely distributed through the tropics, especially in Asia,
occasionally extending into colder regions. About forty species have
been distinguished; of these three are found within the territory of the
United States.

Sapindus contains a detersive principle which causes the pulp of the
fruit to lather in water, and makes it valuable as a substitute for
soap. The bark, which is bitter and astringent, has been used as a
tonic. The seeds of several of the species are strung for chaplets and
bracelets and are used as buttons.

The generic name, from _sapo_ and _Indus_, refers to the detersive
properties and use of the first species known to Europeans, a native of
the West Indies.

ferrugineo-tomentose on the lower surface, persistent. Flowers axillary,
in contracted few-flowered cymes or fascicles, yellow or greenish
yellow; calyx-tube hemispheric, persistent, 5-lobed, the lobes
spreading, triangular-ovate, keeled on the inner surface, deciduous by a
circumscissile line; disk fleshy, annular, 5-angled or indistinctly 5 or
10-lobed; petals 5 yellow or white, inserted under the margin of the
disk, shorter than the lobes of the calyx, cucullate, unguiculate,
infolding the stamens; stamens 5, opposite to and inserted with the
petals; filaments incurved; anthers ovoid; ovary surrounded by and
confluent with the disk, 3-celled, subglobose, contracted into a slender
3-lobed style, the obtuse lobes stigmatic on the inner face; ovule
erect, from the base of the cell. Fruit subglobose, 3-lobed, the outer

the largest number of species in the New World. Of the four species
found within the territory of the United States three are arborescent.

The generic name is from _coluber_, a serpent, probably on account of
the peculiar twisting of the deep furrows on the stems of some of the
species.

                            XXXIX. TILIACEAE.


Trees, shrubs, or herbs, with alternate simple leaves, and free
stipules. Flowers regular, perfect; sepals valvate in the bud,
deciduous; corolla hypogynous; stamens numerous, with 2-celled anthers,
the cells opening longitudinally; pistil compound; styles united into 1;
stigma capitate. Fruit capsular or nut-like. Seeds with albumen; embryo
with broad foliaceous cotyledons.

The Linden family with forty-four genera is chiefly tropical, with more
representatives in the southern than in the northern hemisphere. Of the
three North American genera only Tilia is arborescent.




                     1. TILIA L. Bass Wood. Linden.


Trees, with terete moderately stout branchlets, without a terminal bud,
large compressed acute axillary buds, with numerous imbricated scales,
those of the inner rank accrescent, mucilaginous juice, and tough
fibrous inner bark. Leaves conduplicate in the bud, long-petiolate,
2-ranked, cordate or truncate at the oblique base, acute or acuminate,
serrate, deciduous, their petioles in falling leaving large elevated
horizontal leaf-scars displaying the ends of numerous fibro-vascular
bundles; stipules ligulate, membranaceous, caducous. Flowers
nectariferous, fragrant, on slender clavate pedicels, in axillary or
terminal cymes, with minute caducous bracts at the base of the branches,
their peduncle more or less connate with the axis of a large
membranaceous light green ligulate often obovate persistent
conspicuously reticulate-veined bract; sepals 5, distinct; petals 5,
imbricated in the bud, alternate with the sepals, sometimes thickened
and glandular at the narrow base, creamy white or yellow, deciduous;
stamens inserted on a short hypogynous receptacle; filaments filiform,
forked near the apex, collected into 5 clusters and united at base with
each other and (in the American species) with a spatulate petaloid scale
(_staminodium_) placed opposite each petal, the branches of the filament
bearing oblong extrorse half anthers; ovary sessile, tomentose,
5-celled, the cells opposite the sepals; style erect, dilated at apex
into 5 spreading stigmatic lobes; ovules 2 in each cell, ascending from
the middle of its inner angle, semianatropous, the micropyle
centripetal-inferior. Fruit nut-like, woody, subglobose to short-oblong
or ovoid, sometimes ribbed, tomentose, 1-celled by the obliteration of
the partitions, 1 or 2-seeded. Seeds obovoid, amphitropous, ascending;
seed-coat cartilaginous, light reddish brown; embryo large, often
curved, in fleshy albumen; cotyledons reniform or cordate, palmately
5-lobed, the margins irregularly involute or crumpled; radicle inferior.

Tilia with some thirty species is widely distributed in the temperate
regions of the northern hemisphere with the exception of western
America, central Asia, and the Himalayas. Tilia produces soft
straight-grained pale-colored light wood, largely used for the interior
finish of buildings, in cabinet-making, for the sounding-boards of
pianos, wood-carving and wooden ware, and in the manufacture of paper.
The tough inner bark is largely manufactured into mats, cords,
fish-nets, coarse cloths, and shoes. Lime-flower oil, obtained by
distilling the flowers of the European species, is used in perfumery.
The flowers yield large quantities of nectar, and honey made near
forests of Tilia is unsurpassed in flavor and delicacy. Many of the
species are planted as shade and ornamental trees, and some of the
European species are now common in the gardens and parks of the eastern
United States.

filaments free; anthers introrse. Fruit baccate.

The Pawpaw family with two genera is tropical American and Mexican, a
single representative of the family reaching the shores of southern
Florida.




                              1. CARICA L.


Short-lived trees, with erect simple or rarely branched stems composed
of a thin shell of soft fibrous wood surrounding a large central cavity
divided by thin soft cross partitions at the nodes, and covered with
thin green or gray bark marked by the ring-like scars of fallen
leaf-stalks, and stout soft fleshy roots. Leaves simple, palmately lobed
or digitate, crowded toward the top of the stem and branches, large,
flaccid, subpeltately palmately nerved, and usually deeply and often
compoundly lobed. Flowers regular, monoecious or polygamo-dioecious,
white, yellow, or greenish white, in axillary cymose panicles, the
staminate elongated, pedunculate, and many-flowered, the pistillate
abbreviated and few or usually 3-flowered, generally unisexual and
dioecious, occasionally polygamo-dioecious, each flower in the axil of a
minute ovate acute bract; calyx minute, 5-lobed, the lobes alternate
with the petals; corolla of the staminate flower salverform,
gamopetalous, the tube elongated, 5-lobed, the lobes oblong or linear,
contorted in the bud; stamens 10; filaments free, those of the outer row
alternate with the lobes of the corolla and elongated, the others
alternate with them and abbreviated; anthers 2-celled, erect, opening
longitudinally, often surmounted by their slightly elongated connective;
ovary rudimentary, subulate; pistillate flower, calyx minute, 5-lobed,
persistent under the fruit; corolla polypetalous, petals 5,
linear-oblong, erect, ultimately spreading above the middle, deciduous;
ovary free, sessile, 1-celled or more or less spuriously 5-celled; style
0 or abbreviated; stigmas 5, linear, radiating, dilated and subpalmately
lobed at apex; ovules indefinite, inserted in two rows on the placenta,
anatropous, long-stalked; micropyle superior; raphe ventral;
hermaphrodite flower, corolla gamopetalous, tubular-campanulate, the
lobes erect and spreading or subreflexed; stamens 10, in 2 ranks, or 5;
ovary obovoid-oblong, longer than the tube of the corolla, more or less
spuriously 5-celled below. Fruit slightly 5-lobed, l-celled or more or
less completely 5-celled, filled with soft pulp, many-seeded, that
produced from the hermaphrodite flower long-stalked, pendulous, usually
unsymmetric, gibbous, and smaller than that from the pistillate flower.
Seeds ovoid, inclosed in membranaceous silvery white sac-like arils,
occasionally germinating within the fruit; seed-coat crustaceous,
closely investing the membranaceous inner coat, the outer coat becoming
thick, rugose, succulent, and ultimately dry and leathery; embryo in the
axis of fleshy albumen; cotyledons ovate, foliaceous, compressed, longer
than the terete radicle turned toward the minute pale subbasilar hilum.

Carica with about twenty species is distributed from southern Florida
through the West Indies to southern Brazil and Argentina, and from
southern Mexico to Chile. One species grows probably indigenously in
Florida. The milky juice of Carica contains papain, which has the power
of digesting albuminous substances, and the leaves are often used in
tropical countries to make meat tender.

The generic name is formed from the Carib name of one of the species.


                      1. Carica Papaya L. Pawpaw.

[Illustration: Fig. 681]

Leaves ovate or orbicular, deeply parted into 5--7 lobes divided more or
less deeply into acute lateral lobes, these secondary divisions entire
or rarely lobed, the lowest lobes forming a deep basal sinus, thin,
flaccid, yellow-green, 15'--24' in diameter, with broad flat yellow or
orange-colored primary veins radiating from the end of the petiole
through the lobes, and small secondary veins extending to the point of
the lateral lobes and connected by conspicuous reticulate veinlets;
petioles stout, yellow, hollow, enlarged and cordate at base, sometimes
becoming 3 deg.--4 deg. in length before the leaves fall. Flowers often
beginning to appear on plants only 3 deg. or 4 deg. high and a few months old,
produced continuously throughout the year, the staminate in clusters on
slender spreading or pendulous peduncles 4'--12' long, the pistillate in
1--3-flowered short-stalked cymes; staminate flowers fragrant, filled
with nectar, their corolla 3/4'--1-1/4' long, with a slender tube and
acute lobes; anthers oblong, orange-colored, surmounted by the rounded
thickened end of the connective, those of the inner row almost sessile
and one third larger than those of the outer row, shorter than their
flattened filaments covered, like the connectives, with long slender
white hairs; pistillate flowers about 1' long, with erect petals,
without staminodia; ovary ovoid, ivory-white, slightly and obtusely
5-angled, 1-celled, and narrowed into a short slender style crowned by a
pale green stigma divided to the base into 5 radiating lobes dilated and
3-nerved at apex. Fruits hanging close together against the stem at the
base of the leaf-stalk, obovoid to ellipsoid, and obtusely
short-pointed, yellowish green to bright orange color; in southern
Florida not more than 4' long and 3' thick, and usually smaller, with a
thick skin closely adherent to the sweet insipid flesh forming a thin
layer outside the central cavity; seeds full and rounded, about 3/16'
long; outer portion of the seed-coat rugose at first when the fruit is
fully grown but still green, ivory-white, very succulent, and usually
separable from the smooth paler chestnut-brown lustrous interior
portion, the outer part turning black as the fruit ripens and becoming
adherent to the inner portion closely investing the thin lustrous light
red-brown inner coat.

A short-lived tree, in Florida attaining a height of 12 deg.--15 deg., with a
trunk seldom more than 6' in diameter; in the West Indies and other
tropical countries often twice as large, with a trunk occasionally
dividing into a number of stout upright branches. Bark thin, light
green, becoming gray toward the base of the stem.

Distribution. Florida from the southern shores of Bay Biscayne on the
west coast and of Indian River on the east coast to the southern keys,
growing sparingly in rich hummocks; common in all the West Indian
islands, in southern Mexico, and in the tropical countries of South
America; now naturalized in most of the warm regions of the world, where
it is universally cultivated for its fruit, which is considered one of
the most wholesome of all tropical fruits, and has been much improved by
selection.




                             XLV. CACTACEAE.


Succulent trees or shrubs, with copious watery juice, numerous spines
springing from cushions of small bristles (_areolae_), and minute
caducous alternate leaves, or leafless. Flowers large and showy,
perfect, usually solitary; calyx of numerous spirally imbricated sepals
forming a tube, those of the inner series petal-like; corolla of
numerous imbricated petals, in many series; stamens inserted on the tube
of the calyx, very numerous, in several series, with slender filaments
and introrse 2-celled oblong anthers, the cells opening longitudinally;
pistil of several united carpels; ovary 1-celled, with several parietal
placentas; styles united, terminal; stigmas as many as the placentas;
ovules numerous, horizontal, anatropous. Fruit a fleshy berry. Seeds
numerous, with albumen; cotyledons foliaceous; radicle turned toward the
hilum.

The Cactus family with twenty genera and a very large number of species
is most abundant in the dry region adjacent to the boundary of the
United States and Mexico, with a few species ranging northward to the
northern United States and southward to the West Indian islands, Brazil,
Peru, Chile and the Galapagos Islands. Two of the genera have
arborescent representatives in the flora of the United States.

                             1. CEREUS Haw.


Trees or shrubs, with columnar ribbed stems, and buds on the back of the
ridges from the axils of latent leaves, geminate, superposed, the upper
producing a branch or flower, the lower arrested and developed into a
cluster of spines surrounded by an elevated cushion or areola of chaffy
tomentose scales. Flowers lateral, elongated, the calyx-lobes forming an
elongated tube, those of the outer ranks adnate to the ovary,
scale-like, only their tips free, those of the inner ranks free,
elongated; petals cohering by their base with the top of the calyx-tube,
larger than its interior lobes, spreading, recurved; stamens numerous;
filaments adnate by their base to the tube of the calyx, those of the
interior ranks free, the exterior united into a tube; style filiform,
divided into numerous radiating linear branches stigmatic on the inner
face; stalks of the ovules long and slender, becoming thick and juicy in
the fruit. Seeds with very thin albumen; embryo straight; cotyledons
abbreviated, hooked at apex; radicle conic.

Cereus with at least two hundred species inhabits the dry southwestern
region of North America, the West Indies, tropical South America, and
the Galapagos Islands. Of the numerous species found within the
territory of the United States only one assumes the habit and size of a
tree. The fruit of several species is edible, and the ribs of the
durable woody frames of the stems of the large arborescent species are
used for the rafters of houses and for fuel. Many of the species are
planted in warm dry countries in hedges to protect cultivated fields,
and others are popular garden plants valued for their beautiful flowers,
which are sometimes nocturnal and exceedingly fragrant.

The generic name relates to the candle-like form of the stem of some of
the species.


                  1. Cereus giganteus Engelm. Suwarro.

[Illustration: Fig. 682]

Leaves 0. Flowers 4'--4-1/2' long and 2-1/2' wide, opening from May to
July in great numbers near the top of the stem, each surrounded on the
lower side by the radial spines of the cluster below it; ovary ovoid, 1'
long, rather shorter than the stout tube of the flower, and covered,
like the base of the tube, by the thick imbricated green outer
scale-like sepals, with small free triangular acute scarious mucronate
tips, furnished in their axils with short tufts of rufous hairs and
occasionally with clusters of chartaceous spines, gradually passing into
thin oblong-ovate or obovate larger sepals, mucronate or rounded at apex
and closely imbricated in many ranks; petals 25--35, obovate-spatulate,

their inner surface and inclosing the bright scarlet juicy mass of the
enlarged funiculi and innumerable seeds; seeds obovoid, rounded, 1/6'
long, lustrous, dark chestnut-brown.

A tree, 50 deg.--60 deg. high, with a trunk sometimes 2 deg. in diameter, thickest
below the middle and tapering gradually toward the ends, marked by
transverse superficial lines into rings 4'--8' long, representing the
amount of annual longitudinal growth, 8--12-ribbed at base with obtuse
ribs 4'--5' broad, and at summit 18--20-ribbed with obtuse deep
compressed ribs, branchless or furnished above the middle with a few,
usually 2 or 3, stout alternate or sometimes opposite upright branches
shorter but otherwise resembling the principal stem composed of a thick
tough green epidermis, a fleshy covering 3'--6' thick saturated with
bitter juice, and a circle of bundles of woody fibres making, with
annual layers of exogenous growth, dense tough elastic columns placed
opposite the depressions between the ribs, 1/2'--3' in diameter and
frequently united by branches growing at irregular intervals between
them, the woody frame remaining standing after the death of the plant
and the decomposition of its fleshy covering. Areolae pale, elevated,
about 1/2' in diameter, bearing clusters of stout straight spines with a
large dark fulvous base, sulcate or angled, tinged with red, with thick
stout spines in the centre of each cluster, the 4 basal horizontal or
slightly inclined downward, the lowest being the longest and stoutest
and sometimes 1-1/2' long and 1/12' thick, the upper shorter, more
slender and slightly turned upward, with a row of shorter and thinner
radial spines 12--16 in number surrounding the central group. Wood of
the columns strong, very light, rather coarse-grained, with numerous
conspicuous medullary rays, and light brown tinged with yellow; almost
indestructible in contact with the ground, little affected by the
atmosphere and largely used for the rafters of houses, for fences, and
by Indians for lances, bows, etc. The fruit is consumed in large
quantities by Indians.

Distribution. Low rocky hills and dry mesas of the desert; valley of
Bill Williams River through central and southern Arizona to the valley
of the San Pedro River and to the eastern border of the Colorado Desert
between the Needles and Yuma, Yuma County, Arizona, and southward in
Sonora.




                           2. OPUNTIA Adans.


Trees or usually shrubs, in the arborescent species of the United States
with subcylindric or clavate articulate tuberculate branches, covered
with small sunken stomata, and containing tubular reticulated woody
skeletons, and thick fleshy or fibrous roots. Leaves scale-like, terete,
subulate, caducous, bearing in their axils oblong or circular
cushion-like areolae of chaffy or woolly scales terminal on the branches
and furnished above the middle with many short slender slightly attached
sharp barbed bristles and toward the base with numerous stout barbed
spines surrounded in some species, except at apex, by loose papery
sheaths. Flowers diurnal, lateral, produced from areolae on branches of
the previous year between the bristles and spines, sessile, cup-shaped;
sepals flat, erect, deciduous; corolla rotate; petals obovate, united at
base, spreading; stamens shorter than the petals; filaments free or
slightly united below; anthers oblong; style cylindric, longer than the
stamens, obclavate below, divided at apex into 3--8 elongated or
lobulate lobes stigmatic on the inner face. Fruit sometimes proliferous,
covered by a thick skin, succulent and often edible, or dry, pyriform,
globose or ellipsoid, concave at apex, surmounted by the marcescent tube
of the flower, tuberculate, areolate, or rarely glabrous, truncate at
base, with a broad umbilicus at apex. Seeds immersed in the pulpy
placentas, compressed, discoid, often margined with a bony raphe; testa
pale, bony, sometimes marked by a narrow darker marginal commissure;
embryo coiled around the copious or scanty albumen; cotyledons large;
radicle thin, obtuse.

Opuntia with many species is distributed from southern New England
southward in the neighborhood of the coast to the West Indies, and
through western North America to Chile, Brazil, and Argentina, the
largest number of species occurring near the boundary of the United
States and Mexico. Of the species of the United States at least three
attain the size and habit of small trees. Cochineal is derived from a
scale-insect which feeds on the juices of some of the Mexican species,
and the fruit of several species is refreshing and is consumed in
considerable quantities in semitropical countries. The large-growing
species with flat branches are employed in many countries to form hedges
for the protection of gardens and fields; and the branches saturated
with watery juice are sometimes stripped of their spines and bristles
and fed to cattle.

_Opuntia_ is the classical name of some plant which grew in the
neighborhood of the city of Opus in Boeotia.

purple; radicle elongated, clavate, and when fully grown separating from
the narrow exserted woody tube inclosing the plumule and developed from
the cotyledons after the ripening of the fruit.

Rhizophora with three species is widely and generally distributed on the
shores of tidal marshes in the tropical regions of the two hemispheres,
one specie reaching those of southern Florida. It possesses astringent
properties; the bark has been used in tanning leather, in dyeing, and as
a febrifuge. The wood is hard, durable, and dark-colored. By means of
the aerial germination of its seeds and in its power to develop roots
from trunks and branches, Rhizophora is especially adapted to maintain
itself on low tidal shores and is an important factor in protecting and
extending them into the ocean. Roots springing from the stems at a
considerable distance above the ground and arching outward descend into
the water and fix themselves in the mud beneath, while roots growing
down from the branches enter the ground and gradually thicken into
stems. The fully grown radicle ready to put forth roots and leaves, and
often 10'--12' long, is thicker and heavier at the root end than at the
other, and in detaching itself from the cotyledons and in falling the
heavy end sticks in the mud, while the plumule at the other end, held
above the shallow surface of the water, soon unfolds its leaves.

The generic name, from {rhiza} and {pherein}, was used by early authors
to designate various climbing plants with thickened roots.

Eugenia with some five hundred species is common in all tropical
regions, with eight species reaching the shores of southern Florida, of
these 6 are small trees. Several species are valued for their stimulant
and digestive properties; some produce useful timber or edible fruit,
and others are cultivated for the beauty of their flowers. Cloves are
the flower-buds of _Eugenia aromatica_ Baill., a native of the Molucca
Islands; and _Eugenia Jambos_ L., the Rose Apple, of southeastern Asia,
is cultivated in all tropical countries as a shade-tree and for its
delicately fragrant fruit.

The generic name commemorates the interest in botany and gardening taken
by Prince Eugene of Savoy, who built the Belvidere Palace near Vienna in
the beginning of the eighteenth century, and made a collection of rare
plants in its gardens.

temperate than in tropical regions, has arborescent representatives of
the genus Cornus in North America.




                         1. CORNUS L. Dogwood.


Trees and shrubs, with astringent bark, opposite or rarely alternate
deciduous leaves conduplicate or involute in the bud. Flowers small,
perfect, white, greenish white or yellow; calyx-tube minutely 4-toothed,
the teeth valvate in the bud; disk pulvinate, depressed in the centre,

slightly incurved.

Cornus with nearly fifty species is widely distributed through the three
continents of the northern hemisphere, and south of the equator is
represented in Peru by a single species. Of the sixteen or seventeen
species of the United States four are arborescent. Cornus is rich in
tannic acid, and the bark and occasionally the leaves and unripe fruit
are used as tonics, astringents, and febrifuges. Of exotic species,
_Cornus mas_, L., is often planted in the eastern states as an
ornamental tree, and its edible fruit is used in Europe in preserves and
cordials. The wood of Cornus is hard, close-grained, and durable, and is
used in turnery and for charcoal.

The generic name, from _cornu_, relates to the hardness of the wood
produced by plants of this genus.

                           2. RHODODENDRON L.


Trees or shrubs, with scaly bark, terete branchlets, terminal buds
formed in summer, and fibrous roots. Leaves usually clustered at the end
of the branches, revolute and entire on the margin, persistent or
deciduous. Flowers in terminal umbellate corymbs from buds with numerous
caducous scales; calyx 5-parted or toothed, persistent under the fruit,
corolla 5--10-lobed, deciduous; stamens 5 or 10, rarely more, more or
less unequal, ultimately spreading; filaments subulate-filiform, pilose
at the base; disk thick and fleshy, crenately lobed; ovary 5--10-celled;
style slender, crowned with a capitate stigma and persistent on the
fruit; ovules numerous in each cell, attached in many series to an axile
2-lipped placenta projected from the inner angle of the cell,
anatropous. Fruit a woody many-seeded capsule. Seed scobiform; seed-coat
loose, reticulate, produced at the ends beyond the nucleus into a short
often laciniate appendage; embryo minute, cylindric, axile in fleshy
albumen; cotyledons oblong, shorter than the radicle turned toward the
hilum.

Rhododendron with some four or five hundred species occurs in eastern
Thibet, on the Himalayas, in southwestern China, the Malay peninsula and
Archipelago, New Guinea, northern China and Corea, Japan, the mountains
of central Europe, on the Caucasus, and in eastern and western North
America, the largest number of species being found in southwestern China
and on the Himalayas. Of the twenty-three or twenty-four North American
species one only is arborescent.

Rhododendron possesses astringent narcotic properties. It produces hard
close-grained compact wood sometimes used in turnery and for fuel. Many
of the species are cultivated in gardens for the beauty of their large
and conspicuous flowers.

The generic name is from {rhodon} and {dendron}, the Rose-tree.

Chrysophyllum is tropical, with fifty or sixty species most abundant in
the New World, with a small number of species in western and southern
tropical Africa, southern Asia, Australia, and the Hawaiian Islands, and
with one species in southern Florida. The most valuable species,
_Chrysophyllum Cainito_ L., a native of the West Indies and now
cultivated in all tropical countries and naturalized in many parts of
Central and South America, produces the so-called star-apple, a
succulent edible blue or purple and green fruit the size and shape of a
small apple.

The generic name, from {chrysos} and {phyllon}, is in allusion to the
golden covering of the under surface of the leaves.

fruits, or valuable milky juices.

The significance of the generic name, from {mimo} and {opsis} in
allusion to the shape of the corolla, is not apparent.

extending beyond the tropics into eastern North America, eastern Asia,
southwestern Asia, and the Mediterranean region.

Diospyros produces hard close-grained valuable wood, with dark or black
heartwood and thick soft yellow sapwood. The ebony of commerce is partly
produced by different tropical species. The fruit is often edible, and
some of the species are important fruit-trees in China and Japan.

The generic name, from {Dios} and {pyros}, is in allusion to the
life-giving properties of the fruit.

conditions, sometimes 100 deg.--130 deg. high, with a long slender trunk free of
branches for 70 deg.--80 deg. and rarely exceeding 2 deg. in diameter; frequently
not more than 15 deg. or 20 deg. high and sometimes shrubby in habit.
Winter-buds: axillary, broad-ovoid, acute, 1/8' long, with thick
imbricated dark red-brown or purple lustrous scales often persistent at
the base of young branchlets during the season. Bark of the trunk
3/4'--1' thick, dark brown tinged with red, or dark gray, and deeply
divided into thick square plates broken into thin persistent scales,
with heavy strong dark brown sometimes nearly black heartwood often
undeveloped until the tree is over one hundred years old; used in
turnery, for shoe-lasts, plane-stocks, and preferred for shuttles to
other American woods. The fruit contains tannin, to which it owes its
astringent qualities, and is eaten in great quantities in the southern
states. The inner bark is astringent and bitter.

Distribution. Light sandy well drained soil, or in the Mississippi basin
sometimes on the deep rich bottom-lands of river valleys; Lighthouse
Point, New Haven, New Haven County, Connecticut, and Long Island, New
York, through southern Pennsylvania, southern Ohio, southern Indiana and
Illinois, to southeastern Iowa, eastern Kansas, central Oklahoma, and
southward to De Soto County, Florida, southern Alabama, Mississippi,
Louisiana, and Texas to the valley of the Colorado River (Burnet
County); very common in the south Atlantic and Gulf states, often
covering with shrubby growth by means of the stoloniferous roots
abandoned fields and springing up by the side of roads and fences;
ascending on the Appalachian Mountains to altitudes of 3500 deg.; rare
toward the western limits of its range in Texas. In Missouri and
Arkansas passing into the var. _platycarpa_ Sarg. with larger
broad-ovate leaves rounded or cordate at base or rarely elliptic, more
or less densely pubescent on the lower surface, especially on the midrib
and petiole, often 2-1/2'--4' long and 2'--2-1/2' wide, and at the end
of vigorous shoots up to 6' in length, and depressed-globose, yellow,
rarely nearly black (f. _atra_ Sarg.), fruit much depressed at top and
bottom, 1-3/4'--3' wide and about 1' high, with sweet succulent flesh,
ripening in September or early October, and seeds conspicuously rounded
on the dorsal edge, much compressed, dark chestnut-brown and lustrous,
only slightly rugose, 3/4' long and 1/2' wide. A tree usually not more
than 12 deg.--25 deg. high, with a trunk 16'--30' in diameter and rather stouter
branchlets densely villose-pubescent sometimes for two or three years,
or becoming glabrate at the end of their first season. Hills near
Allenton, St. Louis County, and on the western slopes of the Ozark
Mountains and the adjacent prairies of southeastern Missouri and
prairies of northwestern Arkansas, eastern Kansas and Oklahoma. In Dade
County, Florida, _Diospyros virginiana_ is replaced by the var.
_Mosieri_ Sarg. with smaller staminate flowers, nearly globose fruit
with rather less compressed dark chestnut-brown lustrous only slightly
rugose seeds. A small tree with slightly fissured light gray bark.

Several named varieties of _Diospyros virginiana_ are distinguished and
cultivated by pomologists.

rufous tomentum, ashy gray, glabrous or puberulous during their first
winter, later becoming brown and marked by minute pale lenticels and by
small elevated semiorbicular leaf-scars displaying a lunate row of
fibro-vascular bundle-scars; often much smaller, and toward the northern
and western limits of its range a low many-stemmed shrub. Winter-buds
obtuse, barely more than 1/16' long, with broad-ovate scales rounded on
the back and coated with rufous tomentum. Bark of the trunk smooth,
light gray slightly tinged with red, the outer layer falling away in
large irregularly shaped patches displaying the smooth gray inner bark.
Wood heavy, with black heartwood often streaked with yellow and clear

stellate pubescence more or less persistent during three seasons,
ultimately glabrous and light or dark chestnut-brown; more often a broad
shrub 6 deg.--20 deg. high. Bark of the trunk 1/3'--1/2' thick, close, smooth
and dark red-brown. Winter-buds: axillary, often 3, superposed, acute,
covered with hoary ultimately rusty tomentum, about 1/8' long.

Distribution. Low wet woods and the borders of swamps; southeastern
Virginia, southward usually near the coast to the valley of the
Apalachicola River, Florida, and through the Gulf states to western
Louisiana, ranging inland to northern Georgia, northeastern Mississippi,
and to the valley of the Red River at Natchitoches, Louisiana; of its
largest size and perhaps only arborescent near Laurel Hill, West
Feliciana Parish, Louisiana.




                           LIX. SYMPLOCACEAE.


Trees or shrubs, with simple pubescence, watery juice, scaly buds, and
fibrous roots. Leaves simple, alternate, coriaceous or thin, pinnately
veined, usually becoming yellow in drying, without stipules. Flowers
regular, perfect, or polygamo-dioecious, on ebracteolate pedicels, in
dense or lax axillary spikes or racemes, with small caducous bracts;
calyx campanulate, 5-lobed, open in the bud, the tube adnate to the
ovary, enlarged after anthesis; corolla divided nearly to the base into
3--11 usually 5 lobes imbricated in the bud; disk 0; stamens usually
numerous, inserted in many series on the base of the corolla or rarely 4
in one series; filaments filiform or flattened, more or less united
below into clusters; anthers ovoid-globose, introrse, 2-celled, the
cells lateral, opening longitudinally; ovary inferior or partly
inferior, 2--5-celled, contracted into a simple style, with an entire or
slightly lobed terminal stigma; ovules 2 or rarely 4 in each cell,
suspended from its inner angle, anatropous; raphe ventral; micropyle
superior. Fruit a drupe (in the North American species), crowned with
the persistent lobes of the calyx, with thin dry flesh and a bony
1-seeded stone. Seed oblong, suspended; seed-coat membranaceous; embryo
terete, erect in copious fleshy albumen; cotyledons much shorter than
the long slender radicle turned toward the broad conspicuous hilum.

The family consists of the genus Symplocos.




                          1. SYMPLOCOS L'Her.


Characters of the family.

Symplocos with nearly three hundred species inhabits chiefly the warmer
parts of America, Asia, and Australia, one species occurring in the
southern United States.

Symplocos contains a yellow coloring matter, and the bark and leaves of
some species have medical properties.

The generic name, from {Symplokos}, relates to the union of the
filaments of some of the species.

[Illustration: Fig. 737]

Leaves revolute in the bud, oblong, acute or acuminate at apex,
gradually narrowed at base, obscurely crenulate-serrate with remote
teeth, or sometimes nearly entire, coated below when they unfold with
pale tomentum, glabrous or tomentose above, and furnished on the margins
with minute dark caducous glands, and at maturity subcoriaceous, dark
green and lustrous on the upper surface, paler and pubescent on the
lower surface, 5'--6' long and 1'--2' wide, with a broad midrib rounded
and sometimes puberulous on the upper side, inconspicuous arcuate veins
and reticulate veinlets; northward and at high altitudes falling in the
autumn, and southward remaining on the branches until after the opening
of the flowers the following spring; petioles stout, slightly winged,
1/3'--1/2' in length. Flowers: flower-clusters inclosed in the bud by
ovate acute orange-colored scales brown and ciliate on the margins, each
of the flower-buds surrounded by 3 imbricated oblong bracts rounded or
pointed at apex and ciliate on the margins, the longest as long as the
calyx and one third longer than the 2 lateral bracts; flowers fragrant,
opening from the 1st of March at the south to the middle of May on the
southern Appalachian Mountains, on short pedicels enlarged into thick
hemispheric receptacles covered with long white hairs, in nearly sessile
many-flowered clusters in the axils of leaves of the previous year;
calyx oblong, cup-shaped, dark green and puberulous, with minute ovate
scarious lobes rounded at apex; corolla creamy white, 1/4' long, with
rounded lobes; stamens exserted, with slender filaments united at base
into 5 clusters, and orange-colored anthers; ovary 3-celled, furnished
on the top with 5 dark nectariferous glands placed opposite the lobes of
the calyx, and abruptly contracted into a slender style gradually
thickened toward the apex and longer than the corolla. Fruit ripening in
the summer or early autumn, ovoid, 1/4' long, dark orange-colored or
brown; seed ovoid, pointed, with a thin papery chestnut-brown coat.

A tree, occasionally 30 deg.--35 deg. high, with a short trunk barely exceeding
6'-8' in diameter, slender upright branches forming an open head, and
stout terete pithy branchlets light green and coated with pale or rufous
tomentum when they first appear, or sometimes glabrous, and covered with
scattered white hairs, reddish brown to ashy gray, tinged with red and
usually more or less pubescent or often covered with a glaucous bloom
during their first and second years, later growing darker, roughened by
occasional small elevated lenticels and marked by the low horizontal
obcordate leaf-scars displaying a central cluster of large
fibro-vascular bundle-scars; or more often a shrub. Winter-buds ovoid,
acute, covered with broad-ovate nearly triangular acute scales, those of
the inner rows accrescent on the young branchlets, and at maturity
oblong-obovate, rounded and often apiculate at apex, light green,
glabrous or pilose, ciliate on the margins, and often 1/2' in length.
Bark of the trunk 1/3'--1/2' thick, ashy gray slightly tinged with red,
divided by occasional narrow fissures and roughened by wart-like
excrescences. Wood light, soft, close-grained, light red or brown, with
thick lighter colored often nearly white sapwood of 18--20 layers of
annual growth. The leaves are sweet to the taste and are devoured in the
autumn by cattle and horses, and, like the bark, yield a yellow dye
occasionally used domestically. The bitter aromatic roots have been used
as a tonic.

Distribution. Moist rich soil, often in the shade of dense forests;
peninsula of Delaware to northern Florida and from the coast to
altitudes of nearly 4000 deg. on the Blue Ridge in North and South Carolina,
and to eastern Texas and southern Arkansas; in the Gulf states usually
along the borders of Cypress-swamps.




                              LX. OLEACEAE.


Trees or shrubs, with watery juice, scaly buds, their inner scales
accrescent, opposite leaves, without stipules, and fibrous roots.
Flowers perfect, dioecious or polygamous, regular; calyx 4-lobed, or 0;
corolla of 2--4 petals, or 0; disk 0; stamens 2--4, rudimentary or 0 in
unisexual pistillate flowers; anthers attached on the back below the
middle, often apiculate by the prolongation of the connective, introrse,
2-celled, the cells opening longitudinally usually by lateral slits;
ovary free, 2 or rarely 3-celled, rudimentary or 0 in the staminate
flower; style simple; ovules 2 in each cell, pendulous, anatropous;
micropyle superior. Fruit (in the North American arborescent genera) a
samara or berry. Seed pendulous; seed-coat membranaceous; embryo
straight in copious fleshy albumen; cotyledons flat, much longer than
the short terete superior radicle turned toward the minute hilum.

The Olive family with twenty-five genera is widely distributed in
temperate and tropical regions chiefly in the northern hemisphere. Of
the five genera indigenous to the United States four are arborescent. To
this family belong _Olea europaea_ L., the Olive-tree of the
Mediterranean basin, now largely cultivated in California for its fruit,
and the Lilacs, Forsythias, Privets, and Jasmines, favorite garden
plants in all countries with temperate climates.

                          1. FRAXINUS L. Ash.


Trees or shrubs, with thick furrowed or rarely thin and scaly bark,
usually ash-colored branchlets, with thick pith, and compressed obtuse
terminal buds much larger than the lateral buds. Leaves petiolate,
unequally pinnate or rarely reduced to a single leaflet, deciduous;
leaflets conduplicate in the bud, usually serrate, petiolulate or
sessile. Flowers dioecious or polygamous, produced in early spring on
slender elongated pedicels, without bractlets, in open or compact
slender-branched panicles, with obovate linear or lanceolate caducous
bracts, terminal on leafy shoots of the year, developed from the axils
of new leaves, or from separate buds in the axils of leaves of the
previous year, or at the base of young branchlets, and covered by 2
ovate scales; calyx campanulate, deciduous or persistent under the
fruit, or 0; corolla 2--4-parted, the divisions conduplicate in the bud,
united at base, or 0; stamens usually 2, rarely 3 or 4, inserted on the
base of the corolla, or hypogynous; filaments terete, short or rarely
elongated; anthers ovoid or linear-oblong, the cells opening by lateral
slits; ovary 2 or rarely 3-celled, contracted into a short or elongated
style terminating in a 2-lobed stigma; ovules suspended in pairs from
the inner angle of the cell; raphe dorsal. Fruit a 1 or rarely 2 or
3-seeded winged samara; body terete or slightly flattened contrary to
the septum, with a dry or woody pericarp produced into an elongated more
or less decurrent wing, usually 1-celled by abortion or sometimes 2 or
3-celled and winged. Seed solitary in each cell, oblong, compressed,
gradually narrowed and rounded at the ends, filling the cavity of the
fruit; seed-coat chestnut-brown.

Fraxinus with thirty to forty species is widely distributed in the
temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, and within the tropics
occurs on the islands of Cuba and Java. Of the eighteen North American
species here recognized all, with the exception of _Fraxinus dipetala_
Hook., of California, are large or small trees.

Fraxinus produces tough straight-grained valuable wood, and some of the
species are large and important timber-trees. The waxy exudations from
the trunk and leaves of _Fraxinus Ornus_ L., of southern Europe and Asia
Minor furnish the manna of commerce used in medicine as a gentle
laxative; and the Chinese white wax is obtained from the branches of
_Fraxinus chinensis_ Roxb.

_Fraxinus_ is the classical name of the Ash-tree.

rich bottom-lands of eastern Texas and here often 60 deg.--70 deg. high, with a
trunk 2 deg.--3 deg. in diameter; on the southern Appalachian Mountains
ascending to altitudes of 2000 deg.--2500 deg. As it usually grows in the east
with its bright green glabrous leaves and glabrous branchlets the Green
Ash appears distinct from the Red Ash, but trees occur over the area
which it inhabits, but more often westward, with slightly pubescent
leaves and branchlets which may be referred as well to one tree as to
the other and make it impossible to distinguish satisfactorily as
species the Green and Red Ash.

Often planted as a shade and ornamental tree in the middle western and
occasionally in the eastern states, but less valuable than the White
Ash.

Osmanthus with ten species inhabits eastern North America, the Hawaiian
Islands, Polynesia, Japan, China, and the Himalayas. _Osmanthus
fragrans_ Lour., a native of China and the temperate Himalayas, is
cultivated in China for its fragrant minute cream-colored or yellow
flowers used by the Chinese to perfume tea, and is everywhere a favorite
garden plant.

                            2. AVICENNIA L.


Trees, with coriaceous persistent leaves, stout pithy branches thickened
at the nodes and marked by interpetiolar lines, and long thick
horizontal roots producing numerous short vertical thick and fleshy
leafless stems rising above the surface of the soil. Flowers opposite,
cymose, in centripetal pedunculate spikes or heads, closely invested by
a bract and 2 bractlets, the peduncles solitary or in pairs in the axils
of upper leaves and ternate on the end of the branches, their bracts and
bractlets concave, acute, apiculate, keeled on the back, scarious,
slightly ciliate on the margins, shorter than the corolla, persistent
under the fruit; calyx cup-shaped, coated like the bracts and bractlets
with canescent pubescence, divided nearly to the base into 5 concave
ovate rounded lobes imbricated in the bud; corolla campanulate, white,
with a straight cylindric tube shorter than the glabrous or tomentose
spreading 4-lobed limb, the posterior lobe usually larger than the
others; stamens exserted; filaments short, filiform, slightly thickened
at base; anthers ovoid; ovary ovoid, pubescent, 1-celled, gradually
narrowed into an elongated slender style divided at apex into 2 lobes
stigmatic on their inner face; ovules 4, suspended from the summit of a
free central placenta, orthotropous, naked. Fruit an ovoid oblique
compressed 1-seeded capsule apiculate at apex; pericarp thin, light
green, villose-pubescent on the outer surface, longitudinally veined on
the inner surface, opening by the ventral suture and displaying the
embryo enlarging before separating from the branch, ultimately 2-valved.
Seed naked, without albumen; embryo filling the cavity of the fruit,
light green; cotyledons thick and fleshy, broader than long, slightly
pointed, deeply cordate at base, unequal, conduplicate; radicle
elongated, clavate, retrorsely hirsute, inferior, descending obliquely
and included between the lobes of the cotyledons slightly attached near
the apex in the bottom of the capsule to the withered columella by a
minute papillose point; plumule hairy.

Avicennia with three species is widely distributed on maritime shores of
the tropics of the two worlds, with one species reaching those of the
southern United States. Avicennia produces hard strong wood. The bark is
rich in tannic acid, and is used for tanning leather. The chief value of
these trees is in their ability to live on low tidal shores by the
structure of the embryo, which is growing and ready to take root as soon
as it falls into the soft mud, and in the long horizontal roots
furnished with short vertical fleshy leafless branches or aerating
roots, forming a close network which holds the soil together and
prevents it from being washed away by outflowing tides, and extends the
growth of the tree by numerous stems which soon form dense thickets.

The generic name is in honor of the illustrious physician of the Orient,
Avicenna of Bokhara (980--1036).

                         1. SAMBUCUS L. Elder.


Trees or shrubs, with stout branches containing thick white or brown
pith, and buds with several scales. Leaves petiolate, unequally pinnate,
deciduous, with serrate or laciniate leaflets, the base of the petiole
naked, glandular or furnished with a stipule-like leaflet; stipels
small, leaf-like, usually setaceous, often 0; stipules small,
rudimentary, usually 0 except on vigorous shoots. Flowers small, in
broad terminal corymbose cymes, their bracts and bractlets lanceolate,
acute, scarious, caducous, sometimes ebracteolate; calyx-tube ovoid, the
limb 3--5-lobed or toothed; corolla rotate or slightly campanulate,
equally 3--5-parted; filaments filiform or subulate; ovary inferior or
partly superior, 3--5-celled; style abbreviated, thick and conic,
3--5-lobed, stigmatic at apex. Fruit subglobose, with juicy flesh, and
3--5 oblong cartilaginous punctate-rugulose or smooth 1-seeded nutlets
full and rounded on the back and rounded at the ends. Seeds filling the
cavity of the nutlets, pale brown; cotyledons ovoid.

Sambucus with about twenty species is widely and generally distributed
through the temperate parts of North America, Europe, and Asia, and
inhabits high mountain ranges within the tropics, and in Australia,
Tasmania, and New Zealand. Of the nine or ten North American species
three are arborescent. Sambucus possesses cathartic and emetic
properties in the bark; the flowers are excitant and sudorific, and the
juice of the fruit is alterative and laxative. The dried flowers of the
European _Sambucus nigra_ L., are used in the preparation of an aromatic
distilled water and in flavoring lard, and the hard and compact wood is
made into combs and mathematical instruments. The large pithy shoots of
Sambucus furnish children with pop-guns, pipes, and whistles; and the
fruit of some of the species is cooked and eaten.

_Sambucus_, the name of the Elder-tree, is believed to have been derived
from {sambyke}, a musical instrument, probably in allusion to the use of
the pithy stems.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
