Transcriber's note:

      The Gairdner edition of the Paston Letters was printed in six
      volumes. Each volume is a separate e-text; Volume VI is further
      divided into two e-texts, Letters and Index. Volume I, the
      General Introduction, will be released after all other volumes,
      matching the original publication order.

      Except for footnotes and sidenotes, all brackets are in the
      original, as are parenthetical question marks and (_sic_)
      notations. Series of dots representing damaged text are as in
      the printed original.

      The year was shown in a sidenote at the top of each page; this
      has been merged with the sidenote at the beginning of each
      Letter or Abstract.

      A carat character is used to denote superscription. The
      character(s) following the carat is superscripted (example:
      vj^ti). Braces { } are used only when the superscripted
      text is immediately followed by non-superscripted letters
      or period (full stop). Errata and other transcriber's notes
      are shown in [[double brackets]]. "(o)" is used to represent
      the male ordinal.

      Footnotes have their original numbering, with added page
      number to make them usable with the full Index. They are
      grouped at the end of each Letter or Abstract.

      Typographical errors are listed at the end of each Letter,
      after the footnotes. In the primary text, errors were only
      corrected if they are clearly editorial, such as missing
      italics, or mechanical, such as u-for-n misprints. Italic "d"
      misprinted as "a" was a recurring problem. The word "invisible"
      means that there is an appropriately sized blank space, but the
      letter or punctuation mark itself is missing. The spelling
      "Jhon" is not an error. Gresham and Tresham are different
      people.

      Note that the printed book used z to represent original small
      letter yogh. This has not been changed for the e-text.

  Be yowr broder,

  WM. PASTON.

    [Footnote 1.1: [From Fenn, iii. 220.] There is abundant evidence
    that the year in which this letter was written was 1454. The
    references to Lord Grey's offer of a husband for Elizabeth
    Paston, and to Sir John Fastolf's going into Norfolk, of which
    William Paston had before written by anticipation, though a
    little prematurely, in No. 254, are in themselves sufficient to
    fix the chronology; but the mention of fealty having been done
    by a new Archbishop of Canterbury and a new Bishop of Ely
    removes any possible doubt on the subject.]

ABSTRACT[3.1]

SIR JOHN FASTOLF TO JOHN PASTON.

[Sidenote: 1454-9 / SEPT. 19]

Has searched among his evidence, and found a release of Nycolas Bockyng
of his messuage and lands in Castre, 'sometime Fraunceys and afterward
John Barboures, and Cassandre his wife,' which is enrolled in _Banco,
Rotulo primo de cartis scriptis, de termino Sc. Trin. anno r. R. Henr.
Sexti_, 23(o). Send me the copy of it.

  (_Signature not in his own hand._)

Castre, 19 Sept.

  [The year in which this letter was written is uncertain, but it
  cannot be earlier than 1454, when Fastolf came to Caister, nor later
  than 1459, as he died in November of that year.]

RICHARD SOUTHWELL TO JOHN PASTON[3.2]

_To the right reverent and worshippfull John Paston, in haste._

[Sidenote: 1454(?) / OCT. 6]

Right reverent and worshippfull Sir, and my right trusti and welbelovid
cosin, I recomaund me unto you, praiyng you hertily to remembr me unto
my Master Radclyff, so that by your gode meanes I shall mowe have his
gode mastershipp, the whiche I have effectuelly to [m]y power sewed fore
iij. yer, and never deserved the contrarye to my knowlegge, by my
trouth; and if it can or may be founden that I have, I will obeye me,
and offre me to abyde the rewle of you and my cosin your brothir, &c.

Also my Lord of Caunterbury[4.1] Master Waltier Bl[a]kette will help
forthe, if nede be; and as to the remenant of the Lordes, if the case
requir that ye may understand by your wysdum thei be displeased with
me--as I trust to God thei be not,--I beseche you to remembr that I have
aforetyme b[en] accused unto the Kings Highnesse and the Quenes for
owyng my pore gode will and service unto my Lord of York and other, &c.
Wherof I suppose that Thomas Bagham is remembred that I brought hym
oones from my Lady a purs and v. marc therin, and to Sir Phelipp
Wenteworth an other and a C_s._ [100_s._] therin for their gode will and
advise therin to my Lady and all us that were appelled for that cause,
notwithstanding the King wrote to my Lord by the meanes of the Duc of
Somersette,[4.2] that we shuld be avoyded from hym, &c. And within this
ij. yer we wer in like wise laboured ageyns to the Quene, so that she
wrote to my Lord[4.3] to avoyde us, saiyng that the King and she coude
nor myght in no wyse be assured of hym and my Lady as long as we wer
aboute hym, with much other thing, as may be sufficiently proved by the
Quenes writing under herr own signett and signe manuell, the whiche I
shewd to my Lord of Caunterbury and other Lordes, &c.

I prey you have me excused that I encombr you with thees matiers at this
tyme, for me thinketh ye shuld will and desire me to do any thing to
your honour and pleaser at any tyme, wherto I shal be redy and welwilled
to my power by the grace of God, who have you ever in his keping, and
all youres.

Writon at Norwiche, on Seint Feithes day, in haste.

  Youres,

  RIC. SUTHWELL.

    [Footnote 3.2: [From Fenn, iii. 376.] This letter must have been
    written during one of the periods of the Duke of York's
    ascendency, and on a comparison of possible years I am inclined
    to assign it to 1454. The date 1460, to which Fenn ascribes it,
    would have been highly probable but for the fact that John
    Paston, who was returned to Parliament in that year, does not
    appear to have arrived in London even on the 12th October, so
    that probably he had not left Norwich on the 6th.]

the clocke at evyn, whiche coude in no wyse profit us that day;
notwithstondynge we had a yoman of my Lords chamber, and were at Cowhaw,
havyng Bertylmeu Elys with us, and ther was Long Bernard sytting to kepe
a court. And we at the furst Noy come in the court, and Bertylmeu
havynge this termys to Bernard, seying, 'Sir, forasmych as the Kyng
hathe grauntyd be hese lettres patent the wardship with the profites of

wherfor I am comyn as ther styward, be ther comaundement, upon ther
pocession to kep court and lete, whiche is of old custum usyd upon thys
day; wherfor I charge you, be the vertu herof, to seas and kepe nouthir
court nor lete, for ye have non autoryte.' Quod Bernard, 'I wyll kepe
bothe court and lete, and ye shal non kepe here; for there is no man
hath so gret autoryte.' Than quod Bertylmeu, 'I shal sytte by you, and
take a reconysaunce as ye do.' 'Nay,' quod Bernard, 'I wyl suffre you to
sytte, but not to wryte.' 'Well,' quod Bertylmeu, 'thanne forsybly ye
put us from our pocession, whiche I doute not but shalbe remembryd you

Skylly, whiche hath resevid it of you to ther use.' And thus we
departid, and Bernard kept court and lete.

And ther was Ser P. Wentworth and hise brothir, yong Hopton, yong
Brewse, yong Calthorp, with xxiiij. horse; and we spoke with non of hem,
nor they with non of us, for we wold not seke upon hem. And we have

wryte betymes lever than xx_s._ of myn owne, but it farith thus in many
othir maters, God amende hem.

    [Footnote 5.1: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] This letter is
    anonymous, but appears to be in the handwriting of Thomas Howes.
    It must belong to the year 1454, when the wardship of Thomas
    Fastolf of Cowhaw was granted to Howes and John Paston.]

ABSTRACT[6.1]

SIR JOHN FASTOLF to his right well-beloved Brother, RICHARD WALLER.

[Sidenote: 1454-7 / OCT. 30]

My Lord is and hath been always my good lord, especially now that he is
chief officer under the King. Commend me to his grace, and beg him to
favor my matters 'as far as conscience will, . . . . . now in mine old
age.' Desires his favor and credence for Henry Fylongley and John
[Pa]ston, whom he has desired to wait on Waller.

Castre, 30th Oct.

  _Endorsed._-- 'A John Paston et John Bokkyng ou William Barker.'

  [This letter is written in Botoner's hand. The date is probably
  between 1454 and 1457, as in 1458 Botoner appears to have been in
  London,--at least he was so in November, and in the summer also he
  was away from Norfolk; and in 1459 the 30th October would have been
  within a week of Fastolf's death, when he must have been ill
  inclined, even if capable, to dictate letters, unless of very
  special urgency.]

    seems to have gone immediately after into that of the Duke of
    Norfolk. --_See_ Nos. 268, 278.]

Queen told him Edward; and than he hild up his hands and thankid God
therof. And he seid he never knew til that tyme, nor wist not what was

And he askid who was godfaders, and the Queen told him, and he was wel

    [Footnote 13.1: [From Fenn, i. 80.] There is no doubt about the
    date of this letter. The King fell ill at Clarendon in the
    autumn of 1453, and remained in a state of utter imbecility
    during the greater part of the year 1454, so that in March a
    deputation from the House of Peers, sent to communicate with him
    on the death of his Chancellor, Cardinal Kemp, was obliged to
    report that they had been utterly unable to obtain from him any
    answer or sign that he understood the least thing said to him.
    It appears from this letter that his recovery was about
    Christmas, when he heard for the first time of the birth of his
    son fourteen months before, and of the death of Cardinal Kemp
    nine months before.]

SIR JOHN FASTOLF TO HENRY FYLONGLYE AND JOHN PASTON.

[Sidenote: 1455 / JAN. 24]

Must pay L40 to the Exchequer this term for the ward of Thomas Fastolf,
in part payment of L80, and other great payments at the same time,
amounting to L200 or more. Desires him, therefore, to speak with my Lord
of Canterbury, whose day of payment is long past, that he may have 'the
rather ready payment' of his duty; 'for he is one of the Lords earthly
that I most trust upon.' Hopes he will consider the great loss Fastolf
already sustains by 'the great good the King oweth me, and other divers
Lords to my great discomfort.'

Castre, 24 Jan.

  [This letter could not have been written before the year 1455, as
  Sir John Fastolf only came to reside at Castre in the autumn of the
  year preceding. The wardship of Thomas Fastolf was procured by Sir
  John for John Paston in June 1454, so that it is highly probable he
  had to pay for it in the beginning of next year. In the year
  following, again, Fastolf was endeavouring to make good those claims
  against the Crown, which he here merely mentions as a ground of
  indulgence to himself.]

    allowed to lapse to the Bishop, who presented Simon Thornham,

    that in that year St. Benet's day (the 21st of March) fell on a
    Friday; and second, that in the same year the living of Stokesby

    this is not unlikely to be the letter mentioned in the
    postscript to the last, of which a copy or draft was sent along
    with the original to John Paston that he might deliver the
    latter, only if he approved of its contents. If so, it is

    [Footnote 20.1: [From Fenn, iii. 338.] Although there is no
    direction upon this letter, it was evidently addressed to the
    Duke of Norfolk, as it speaks of 'your Castle of Framlingham.'
    The absence of any written address Fenn accounts for by
    supposing the letter to have been enclosed in a cover; but as it
    appears that the original contained at least one passage which
    was crossed out (_see_ page 341 in Fenn), we may with greater
    probability consider it to have been a corrected draft, like the
    last, sent to John Paston for his approval. The dispute with Sir
    Philip Wentworth and the matters of John Porter and Sir Thomas
    Howes, here referred to, both point to the year 1455 as the date
    of this letter. --_See_ Nos. 265, 268.]

ABSTRACT[22.1]

SIR JOHN FASTOLF TO JOHN PASTON.

[Sidenote: 1455 / MAY 3]

Thanks him for his letters, and the answer he made to Bokkyng. Does not
know how to answer him concerning the ward,[22.2] the suit against
William Jenney and Sir Thomas, etc. If Paston could be at London this
term, even for three days, it would speed better than Fastolf's writing,
and Fastolf will pay his costs. If he cannot, Paston must use his own
discretion, and Fastolf will abide by what he does. It would be a great
rebuke if the matter of the ward went against us, 'for nowadays ye know
well that law goeth as it is favored, and after that the attorneys be
wise and discreet in their conduct.'

Castre, 3 May.

  [This letter, being dated at Caister in the month of May, cannot be
  earlier than 1455, and the references to the matter of the ward and
  the suit against Sir Thomas Howes seem to fix it to that year.]

ABSTRACT[22.3]

RICHARD CALLE TO JOHN PASTON.

[Sidenote: 1455(?) / MAY 8]

Thorne did not come to him, nor could he learn anything about him from
Sir Thomas Howes, except that Howes had informed him of what Paston
commanded Calle to tell his wife. Will not distrain till he hear from
Paston. Howys trusts to make sufficient reckoning of all things touching
Fastolf, so that neither he nor Paston be hurt. He will do nothing in
future without Paston's advice. Desires him to remember John Elger,
Bocking, and others 'for the rescues which was made for Jankyn Porter.'
Remember James Gresham to withdraw the suit for W. Magges. No News.

  [The allusion to John or Jankyn Porter in this letter makes it
  probable that it was written in the year 1455. --_See_ No. 278.]

THE BATTLE OF ST. ALBANS[25.1]

_Bellum apud Seynt Albons._

[Sidenote: 1455 / MAY 21-22]

Be yt knowen and hadde in mynde that the xxj. day of May the xxxiij.
zere of the regne of Kyng Herry the Sext, our sovereigne Lord Kyng toke
his jurnay from Westmynster toward Seynt Albones, and rested at Watford
all nyght; and on the morwe be tymes he cam to Seynt Albones, and wyth
him on his partye assembled under his baner the Duyke of Bockingham, the
Duke of Somersete, the Erle of Penbrok, the Erle of Northumburlond, the
Erle of Devynsshire, the Erle of Stafford, the Erle of Dorsete, the Erle
of Wyltsshire, the Lorde Clyfford, the Lord Dudley, the Lord Burneys,
the Lord Rose, wyth other dyversse knyghtes, squyeres, and other
gentilmen and yemen to the nounbre of ij^ml [2000] and moo. And upon the
xxij. day of the seyde moneth above rehersed assembled the Duyk of
Yorke, and wyth hym come yn companye the Erle of Salesbury, the Erle of
Warrewyke with diverse knyghtes and squyers unto ther partye into the
felde, called the Key Feld, besyde Seynt Albones. Fyrthermore, oure seyd
sovereyne Lord the Kyng, heryng and knowyng of the seyde Dukes comyng
with other Lordes afore seyde, pygth his baner at the place called
Boslawe in Seynt Petrus Strete, whych place was called afore tyme past
Sandeforde, and commaundeth the warde and barrers to be kepte in stronge
wyse; the for seyde Duyk of York abydyng in the feld aforeseyde frome
vij. of the clokke in the morn tyl yt was al most x. without ony stroke
smeton on eyther partye. The seyde Duke sende to the Kyng our sovereyne
Lord, be the avyse of his councell, prayng and be sekyng hym to take him
as his true man and humble suget; and to consider and to tender at the
reverence of Almyghty God, and in way of charite the true entent of his
comyng--to be good and gracyous sovereyne Lorde to his legemen, whech
with al ther power and mygth wille be redy at alle tymes to leve and dye
with hym in his rigth. And to what thyng yt shoulde lyke his Mageste
Ryall to commaunde hem, yf yt be his worsship, kepyng right of the
Croune and welffare of the londe; 'More over, gracyous Lord, plese yt
zour Majeste Ryall of zour grete goodnesse and ryghtwesnesse to enclyne
zour wille to here and fele the ryghtwyse partye of us zoure sugettes
and legemen; fyrst, prayng and besechyng to oure Lord Jesus of his hye
and myghty power to geve un to zou vertu and prudence, and that thorugh
the medyacyon of the glorious martyr Seynt Albon to geve zou very
knowleche to knowe the entent of oure assembleng at this tyme; for God
that is [in] Heven knoweth than our entent is rightful and true. And
there fore we pray unto Al myghty Lord Jesus these wordes--_Domine sis
clipeus defensionis nostrae_. Wherefore, gracyus Lord, plese it your
hyghe Majeste to delyvere such as we wole accuse, and they to have lyke,
as they have deserved and done, and ze to be honorabled and worsshepyt
as most ryghtffull Kyng and oure governour. For and we shall now at this
tyme be promysed, as afore this tyme ys not unknowen, of promes broken
whech ful fayth fully hath ben promysed, and there upon grete othes
made, we wyll not now cesse for noon such promysse, surete, ne other,
tyl we have hem whych hav deserved deth, or elles we to dye there fore.'

And to that answered the Kyng our sovereyne Lord, and seyde: 'I, Kyng
Herry, charge and comaund that no maner persone, of what degre, or
state, or condicyon that evere he be, abyde not, but voyde the felde,
and not be so hardy to make ony resystens ageyne me in myn owne realme;
for I shall knowe what traytor dar be so bold to reyse apepull in myn
owne lond, where thorugh I am in grete desese and hevynesse. And by the
feyth that I owe to Seynt Edward and to the Corone of Inglond, I shal
destrye them every moder sone, and they be hanged, and drawen, and
quartered, that may be taken afterward, of them to have ensample to alle
such traytours to be war to make ony such rysyng of peple withinne my
lond, and so traytorly to abyde her Kyng and governour. And, for a
conclusyon, rather then they shall have ony Lorde here with me at this
tyme, I shall this day, for her sake, and in this quarrell my sylff lyve
or dye.'

Wych ansuere come to the Duke of Yorke, the wheche Duke, by the avyce of
the Lordes of hys Counceill, seyde unto hem thise wordes: 'The Kyng our
sovereyne Lord will not be reformed at our besechyng ne prayer, ne wylle
not understonde the entent that we be comen heder and assembled fore and
gadered at this tyme; but only ys full purpose, and there noon other wey
but that he wole with all his power pursue us, and yf ben taken, to geve
us a shameful deth, losyng our lyvelode and goodes, and our heyres
shamed for evere. And ther fore, sythe yt wole be noon othere wyse but
that we shall ootterly dye, better yt ys for us to dye in the feld than
cowardly to be put to a grete rebuke and asshamefful deth; more over,
consederyng yn what peryle Inglonde stondes inne at thys owre, therefore
every man help to help power for the ryght there offe, to redresse the
myscheff that now regneth, and to quyte us lyke men in this querell;
preyng to that Lord that ys Kyng of Glorye, that regneth in the kyngdom
celestyall, to kepe us and save us this day in our right, and thorugh
the helpe of His holy grace we may be made strong to with stonde the
grete abomynable and cruell malyse of them that purpose fully to destrye
us with shameful deth. We ther fore, Lord, prey to The to be oure
confort and Defender, seyng the word afore seyde, _Domine sis clipeus
defensionis nostrae_.'

And whanne this was seyde, the seyde Duke of Yorke, and the seyd Erle of
Salesbury, and the Erle of Warrewyk, betwene xj. and xij. of the clocke
at noon, the broke into the toun in thre diverse places and severelle
places of the fore seyd strete. The Kyng beyng then in the place of
Edmond Westby, hunderdere of the seyd toun of Seynt Albones, comaundeth
to sle alle maner men of lordes, knygthtes, and squyeres, and zemen that
myght be taken of the for seyde Dukes of York. Thys don, the fore seyde
Lord Clyfford kept strongly the barrers that the seyde Duke of York
myght not in ony wise, with all the power that he hadde, entre ne breke
into the toun. The Erle of Warrewyk, knowyng ther offe, toke and gadered
his men to gedere and ferosly brake in by the gardeyne sydes betuene the
signe of the Keye and the sygne of the Chekkere in Holwell strete; and
anoon as they wer wyth inne the toon, sodeynly the blew up trumpettes,
and sette a cry with asshout and a grete voyce, 'A Warrewe! A Warrewyk!
A Warrewyk!' and into that tyme the Duke of York mygth nevere have entre
into the toun; and they with strong hond kept yt, and myghttyly faught
to gedere, and anoon, forth with after the brekyng in, they sette on
them manfully. And as of Lordes of name were slayn the Lord Clyfford,
the Duke of Somersete, the Erle of Northumberlond, Sir Bartram
Entuwysselle, Knynght; and of men of courte, Wyllyam Zouch, John
Batryaux, Raaff of Bapthorp and hys sone, Wyllyam Corbyn, squyers;
William Cotton, receyver of the Ducherye of Lancastre; Gylbert Starbrok,
squyer; Malmer Pagentoun, William Botelore, yomen; Rogere Mercroft, the
Kynges messanger; Halyn, the Kynges porter; Raufe Wyllerby; and xxv. mo,
whych her names be not zet knowen. And of hem that ben slayn ben beryed
in Sent Albonos xlviij. And at this same tyme were hurt Lordes of
name--the Kyng, our sovereyne Lord, in the neck with an arrowe; the Duke
of Bukingham, with an arrowe in the vysage; the Lord of Stafford in the
hond, with an arowe; the Lord of Dorsette, sore hurt that he myght not
go, but he was caryede hom in a cart; and Wenlok, Knyght, in lyke wyse
in a carte sore hurt; and other diverse knyghtes and squyers sore hurt.
The Erle of Wyldsshyre, Thorpe, and many other flede, and left her
harneys behynde hem cowardly, and the substaunce of the Kynges partye
were dyspoyled of hors and harneys. This done, the seyde Lordes, that ys
to wote, the Duke of Yorke, the Erle of Salesbury, the Erle of
Warrewyke, come to the Kyng, our sovereyne Lord, and on here knees be
soughte hym of grace and foryevenesse of that they hadde doon yn his
presence, and be sought hym of his Heynesse to take hem as hys true
legemen, seyng that they never attendyde [_intended_] hurt to his owne
persone, and ther fore [the] Kyng oure sovereyn Lord toke hem to grace,
and so desyred hem to cesse there peple, and that there shulde no more
harme be doon; and they obeyde hys commaundement, and lote make a cry on
the Kynges name that al maner of pepull shulde cesse and not so hardy to
stryke ony stoke more after the proclamacyon of the crye; and so cessed
the seyde batayle, _Deo gratias_.

And on the morwe the Kyng and the seyde Duke, with other certeyn Lordes,
come in to the Bysshops of London, and there kept resydens with joye and
solempnyte, concludyng to holde the parlement at London, the ix. day of
July next comyng.

ABSTRACT[32.1]

SIR JOHN FASTOLF TO JOHN PASTON.

[Sidenote: 1455 / MAY 28]

Thanks him for his pains in speeding his causes at London this term.
Understands the Sheriff of Norfolk's officers are at Norwich, and now
the writ of attaint is sent home by William Barker, which Fastolf sends
again to Paston that he may consult with the Sheriff or his officers
what to do. Both William Barker and Seffrey (_sic_) Spyrlyng are now at
Norwich, and one of them, if need be, shall wait on Paston.

Castre, 28 May.

'And I trust to God, as the world goeth now, the said attaint shall do
right well.'

  [The postscript of this letter seems to refer to the change of
  administration after the battle of St. Albans. As to the action of
  attaint sued by Fastolf, see Nos. 268 and 276.]

The Duk Buk is come inne, and sworn that he shal be rewled, and draw the
lyne with theym; and ther to he and his brethern ben bounde by
reconysaunce in notable summes to abyde the same.

The Erle of Wylts sent to the Lordes from a place of his, called
Peterfeld, a lettre desyring to know if he shuld come, and abyde abought
the Kynges persone as he dede be fore; and if he shuld not, than that
they wold lycence hym to goon in to Erland, and leve there upon his

ABSTRACT[34.2]

SIR JOHN FASTOLF TO JOHN PASTON.

[Sidenote: 1455 / JUNE 11]

Thanks him for his letter sent from London. Bokkyng writes that a writ
of _ravishment de garde_ is taken, and Wentworth's counsel 'call sore
upon the action of 200 marks in the Common Pleas, and John Andreus is
ready there, and writs of _capias_ ayenst John Porter as well as ayenst
Sir Thomas.' Begs him to hasten to London, as there is great labour
against our intent. Wentworth has got Debenham, Radclyff, and others in
my Lord's house against us. Would rather he were at London two days too
early than too late; for he trusts no man's wit so much as Paston's.

Castre, 11 June.

  [The references in this letter to the affair of the wardship, and to
  the actions against John Porter and Sir Thomas Howes, all show that
  it belongs to the year 1455.]

    [Footnote 35.1: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] This is only the
    mutilated postscript of a letter without any address, though it
    was doubtless directed to John Paston. The anxiety expressed
    that Paston should be in London in good time corresponds so
    closely with the contents of the preceding letter that we may
    refer this to the same period, especially as both the preceding
    letter and this are in the handwriting of William Worcester. The
    matter, which was to be engrossed before the Courts removed, had
    reference probably to the wardship of Thomas Fastolf of
    Cowhawe. --_See_ No. 292 following.]

Mi Maister Paston, I recomaunde me to you. And wher ye shulde be
enformed that I shulde sey to Howard[38.2] that ye labored to be Knyght
of the shire, I seid never soo to hym. I tolde my Lord of Norffolk atte
London that I labored diverse men for Sir Roger Chaumberleyn, and they
seid to me they wolde have hym, but not Howard, in asmeche as he hadde
no lyvelode in the shire, nor conversement [_i.e._ acquaintance?]; and I
asked them hom they wolde have, and they seid they wolde have you, and
thus I tolde hym. And he seid on avysely, as he kan doo full well,
I myght not sey ye labored ther, for I herde never sey ye labored
therfor, be the feithe I vowe to God.

As for this writ of the Parlement of Norwich, I thanke you that ye will
labour ther in; as for my frendys ther, I truste right well all the
aldermen, except Broun[38.3] and sech as be in his dawnger.[38.4] I prey
you spekith to Walter Jeffrey[38.5] and Herry Wilton,[38.6] and maketh
them to labour to your entent. I prey you that yf ye thenke that it wull
not be, that it like you that to sey that ye meve it of your self, and
not be my desire. Sum men holde it right straunge to be in this
Parlement, and me thenketh they be wyse men that soo doo.

plesith you to take seche labour for me as ye doo. My servaunt tolde me
ye desired to knowe what my Lord of Norffolk seid to me whan I spake of
you; and he seid in asmeche as Howard[39.3] myght not be, he wolde write
a lettre to the Under-Shreve that the shire shulde have fre eleccion,
soo that Sir Thomas Todenham wer not, nor none that was toward the Duc
of Suffolk; he seid he knewe ye wer never to hym ward. Ye may[39.4]
sende to the Under-Shreve, and see my Lord lettre. Howard was as wode as
a wilde bullok; God sende hym seche wurshipp as he deservith. It is a
evill precedent for the shire that a straunge man shulde be chosyn, and
no wurshipp to my Lord off Yorke, nor to my Lord of Norffolk to write
for hym; for yf the jentilmen of the shire will suffre sech
inconvenyens, in good feithe, the shire shall not be called of seche
wurshipp as it hathe be.

    1457, when she presented to the living of Woodnorton (_see_
    Blomefield, iv. 313). But the writer of this was more probably a
    daughter, serving in the household of a lady of rank according

    [Footnote 41.1: [From Fenn, iii. 128.] At the date of this
    letter, William Worcester and his master, Sir John Fastolf, were
    both at Caister, though the latter was thinking of going up to
    London. This, being in July, cannot have been before 1455. Fenn
    supposes the pardon to Poynings to have been on account of his
    participation in Cade's rebellion, and accordingly dates this
    letter 'about 1451.' But Poynings was accused of raising
    disturbances in 1453 and 1454. The reversal of Sir William
    Oldhall's outlawry was in 1455; for we have seen in No. 287 that
    he was obliged to remain in sanctuary for some little time after
    the battle of St. Albans. It appears by an _inspeximus_ on
    Patent Roll, 34 Hen. VI., m. 16, that he presented a petition to
    the King in Parliament on the 9th July, 33 Hen. VI. (1455),
    setting forth how he had served the King in France, and yet had
    been pronounced a traitor by the Parliament of Reading in 31
    Hen. VI., but that his outlawry had been reversed in the King's
    Bench.]

Worshipfull Sir, and my most hertely and best be loved brother,
I recommaund me unto you in more loly wise than I can other thenk or

lettres, full brotherly written unto me at mony tymes of old, and
especiall of late tyme passed. And trwly, brother, I thank Almyghty God
of your welfare, of the which the berer of this my pour lettre certified
me of, &c.

And, Sir, as touchyng al maner of newe tithinges, I knoo well ye are
averous; truly the day of makyng of this letter, ther were nonn newe,
but suche I herd of, ye shalbe served with all.

As for the first, the Kyng our souverain Lord, and all his trwe Lordes
stand in hele of there bodies, but not all at hertes ees as we. Amonges
other mervell, ij. dayes afore the writyng of this letter, there was
langage betwene my Lordes of Warrewikke and Cromwell afore the Kyng, in
somuch as the Lord Cromwell wold have excused hym self of all the
steryng or moevyng of the male journey of Seynt Albones; of the whiche
excuse makyng, my Lord Warrewikke had knolege, and in hast wasse with
the Kyng, and sware by his othe that the Lord Cromwell said not trouth,
but that he was begynner of all that journey at Seynt Albones; and so
betwene my said ij. Lords of Warrewikke and Cromwell ther is at this day
grete grugyng, in somoch as the Erle of Shrouesbury hath loged hym at
the hospitall of Seynt James, beside the Mewes, be the Lord Cromwells
desire, for his sauf gard.

And also all my Lord of Warrewikke men, my Lord of York men, and also my
Lord of Salesbury men goo with harnes, and in harnes with strang wepons,
and have stuffed their Lordes barges full of wepon dayly unto
Westminster. And the day of makyng of this letter, ther was a
proclamacion made in the Chauncerie, on the Kyngs behalf, that noman

shuld have set to your seales; and if that Heydon had be vj. howrs fro
the Parlement lenger than he was, ther had be granted an _oyer
determiner_ to have enquer of hem, &c. This was told yesterday in right
wurchepfull audience, and a mong the thrifties men of this countre; and
thei seyd right shrewedly, for my lord of Norwich hath so flatered the
lay pepill as he hath redyn a bought his visitacion that he hath thers

shuld sey to it, wher as I her any such langage, I wull do my parte, and

    [Footnote 45.2: [From Fenn, iv. 32.] This letter is attributed
    by Fenn to the year 1461, but that date is certainly inaccurate,
    as it was answered by John Paston at Norwich the very day it was
    written, whereas in July 1461 Paston was in London. Moreover, it
    certainly could not have been _after_ 1461, as Sir Thomas
    Tuddenham was beheaded in February of the following year. It
    must therefore belong to the reign of Henry VI.; and considering
    the time of the year, 1455 is the only date at which it is at
    all likely that any one would have ventured to attempt the
    impeachment of Tuddenham and Heydon in Parliament, or could have
    been plausibly accused of such a design against persons of so
    much influence.]

Please it your maistership to wete[48.2] . . . .

Here be many marvaylos tales of thynggs that shall falle this next

reported. I trust to God it shall not falle so.

Also there is gret varyance bytwene the Erll of Devenshire and the Lord
Bonvyle, as hath be many day, and meche debat is like to growe therby;
for on Thursday at nyght last passed, the Erll of Denshyres sone and

whiche was of counseil with my Lord Bonvyle; and they sette an hous on

sory for the fyer; and by that cause Radfords men set opyn the gats and
yede owt to se the fyer; and for with th'erll sone forseid entred into

with them, promyttyng hym that he shuld no bodyly harm have; up on
whiche promysse he come doun, and spak with the seid Erll sone.

In the mene tyme his menye robbe his chambre, and ryfled his
huches,[49.2] and trussed suyche as they coude gete to gydder, and
caryed it awey on his own hors. Thanne th'erll sone seid, 'Radford, thou
must come to my lord my fadir.' He seid he wold, and bad oon of his men
make redy his hors to ride with hem, whiche answerd hym that alle his
hors wern take awey; thanne he seid to th'erll sone, 'Sir, your men have
robbed my chambre, and thei have myn hors, that I may not ride with you
to my lord your fadir, wherfor, I pray you, lete me ride, for I am old,
and may not go.'

It was answerid hym ageyn, that he shuld walke forth with them on his

SIR JOHN FASTOLF 'TO MY RIGHT TRUSTY BROTHER, NICHOLAS MOLYNEUX.'

[Sidenote: 1455 / OCT. 30]

As I come not to London this winter, I beg you to see to my Lord's
matters, and labour to my Lord of Canterbury and Master John Stokys for
the recovering of my Lord's[50.3] [good]s. No man can say more in the
matter than you where his goods are, 'and where they be disposed,'
especially those that Sir Rob. Whytynham[50.4] had. Also the Lord
Cromwell had 'a certain number of plate.' Your costs shall be paid out
of the first money received. Hears from John de Leawe, one of Lord
Willoughby's executors, that they will labour to my Lord Beaumont to
advance the process for recovery of his part of the reward for the
taking of the Duke of Alencon. Fendykes, a learned man of the Temple,
will help with his advice. Commend me to my sister your wife.

  [During the winter of 1455-56 we find several allusions to this
  claim put forward by Fastolf to the goods of the late Duke of
  Bedford. Unless we are to infer from the manner in which Lord
  Cromwell is mentioned that he was dead when this letter was written,
  it is probably of the year 1455.]

    [Footnote 51.1: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] On the 11th November
    1454 Sir John Fastolf wrote to Paston about the goods of the
    Duke of Bedford, but the subject recurred to his thoughts for
    more than a year afterwards, and particularly in January 1456,
    when all the other executors of the Duke were dead. This letter
    is certainly before the death of Lord Cromwell, and therefore
    not later than 1455; but it seems to indicate much greater
    solicitude on the subject than Fastolf showed in the preceding
    year.]

SIR JOHN FASTOLF TO JOHN PASTON.

[Sidenote: [1455] / DEC. 11]

Thanks him for his pains in the advancement of his 'chargeable matters.'
Was never so much bound to any kinsman as to Paston, who tenders so much
his worship and profit. Sends Worcestre with important letters to my
Lord Privy Seal and the Abbot of Bermundsey, and would like Paston to
common with them. Thanks him for informing him of the answer made to the
bill of Wentworth, 'which I know had stand in great jeopardy had not ye
be.' Sends his evidences concerning Bradwell, that the Judges and
Parliament may have better consideration of his right, and of the
patents granted to Paston and Howys in that behalf. Desires credence for
William Worcestre.

Castre, 11 Dec.

  [The date of this letter must be between the year 1454, when Sir
  John Fastolf settled at Caister, and 1458, as he was not alive in
  December 1459. The reference to Parliament fixes it more precisely,
  as 1455 was the only year during this period in which Parliament sat
  in December.]

charge to the King, for the value and denombrement [_number_] of iiij.
m^{l}. saluz[57.2] of yerly rent, he was commaunded by the Kinges
lettres to deliver upp the sayd baronyes and lordshipps to the Kyngs
commissioners, promyssyng hym, by the Kyngs commaundement to have be
recompensed therefor, as the seyd Fastolf hath to shewe, and he not
recompensed nor rewarded no thing for the levyng of his seyd baronyes
and lordship, to the damages of the seyd Fastolf of the somme of

    m^{l}. m^{l}. v.^c [2,500] marc.

Item, wher as the seyd Fastolf had a prisonner of his owen taking,
called Guill'm Remond,[58.1] which was raunsonned, and agreed to pay hym
for his raunson with the marks the somme of xxxij. m^{l}. saluz, the
prisonner, withoute knowelege or licence of the seyd Fastolf, was take
awey from hym by the Duc of Bedford, then beyng the Kyngs Regent of
Fraunce; and with the seyd prisonner he caused the towne of Compyn, than
leyng in the Frensh partye ys gouvernaunce, for to be yeldyn to the
Kyng, and to his seyd Regent in his name; and the seyd Fastolf, after
long pursewts made to the Kyng and his conseill, was recompensed but to
the value of m^{l}. vj^{c}. saluz in lands in Normandye, when they
fortuned to falle into the Kyngs hands, which lands he hath also lost.
And also the seyd Fastolf hath lost the residue of the seyd raunson,

forteresses, castellys, and townes, and for othir costs, prests, and
charges by hym born in his service, as it may appiere in certeyn
articles writen in a rolle partic'lerly of the same, the somme of

Item, seth the last comyng over of the seyd Fastolf into this royaume,
as by the space of xv. yere and more, he hath born grete costs, charges,
and expenss, at alle tymes intending uppon the Kyngs highnesse and the
Lordes of his counseille, as he hath had in commaundement, and was his
part to doo; for the which and for all the service that he hath doo to
the right noble Prince Kyng Herry the iiij^the, ayle [_grandfather_] to
our Souvragn Lord that now ys, and to the most victorious Prince and
Kyng, his fader, whos soulys God assoyle, and also to our seyd Souvereyn
Lord, he hath had, nouther fee, wagys, reward, ne recompense in this his
royaume of England, but hath born it of hys own propre godys, at all
tymys to the Kyngs honour and prouffit as to his power, which ys to hym
right grevouse and chargeable, trusting to have be considered and
rewarded as othir men of suche deservyng have be in the tymes of the
right noble progenitours of our seyd Souvreyn Lords, late Kyngs of this
seyd reaume.

  There are two drafts of the preceding statement among the Paston
  MSS. in the British Museum, besides an imperfect draft hereafter
  mentioned. These appear to have been drawn up as early as the year
  1452. One of these is in William Worcester's handwriting; the other
  is a fair copy from it, with further corrections, in his hand. The
  document printed above embodies all the corrections in the second
  paper, and corresponds with it almost exactly in every point, except
  that the latter places the second item relating to the Duke of
  Clarence at the very end of the account, and contains the following
  additional entries:--

And beside all this, there is yet owyng to the sayd Fastolf uppon the
voyage that Thomas Danyell made into Bretayn, as it is openly knowen,
the somme of

    C_li._

Item, overe this the seyd Fastolf lent to the voyage that Sir
Thomas Kyryell made into Normandye, in the xxviij. yere of the regne of
the Kyng our Souverain Lorde, the somme of CC. marc; also lent to the

And also the seyd Fastolf hath borne grete charge and cost of alone made
for the spede and helpe of the voyage whiche the Erle of
Shrowysbury[64.1] now last made into the Kynges duchie of Guyenne, to
whom God graunte good expedicion, as it shewith by suffisaunt writyng,
for whiche at the commaundement of my Lord Cardynalle[64.2] the seyd
Fastolf made a chevyssaunce and leyd to wedd [_i.e._ pawned] the
substaunce of his pore juellys, in the whiche chevyssaunce the seyd
Fastolf hath lost xxxvij_li._, and is like to lese more herafter, by
cause he is not of poer to quyte hem oute; the seyd juellys lyne as yet
to plegge for the somme of

    iiij^{c}_li._

Somme of the prestys and debtys abofe rehersed,

    ij^{ml}. xlv. markes, vj_s._ v_d._ _ob._

  The following is written on a separate paper, on the back of which
  occurs the imperfect draft above referred to.

Item, overe all thys grete debtes dew at thys day to the seyd Fastolf,
he desyryth and prayth that it may be pondered and concydered the grete
lossez and damages that he hath susteyned and born, as well in the
parties of Fraunce as in thys land; as at one tyme lost the somme and
value of iiij^{ml}. mark for Guillem Remond, hys prysonnere, that agreed
to pay for hys raunsom xxxij^{ml}. salux. The seyd prisonnere was take
awey from hym, and delyvered the toune of Compyne in to the obbeissaunce
of our Souvereyn Lord. Also the reward that the seyd Fastolf shuld hafe
hys part for the takyng of the Duc off Allaunson, whych shuld mount for
hys seyd part iiij^{ml}. [4000] markes, the grete losse that he hath in
delyveryng upp the baronye of Syllye Guillem, in the counte of Mayn, be
thout [_without_] recompense or reward, whych was gevyn to hym and hys
assigneez in the value of m^{l}. m^{l}. [2000] salux off yerly rent.
Also the lesyng of hys pore lyvelode in Normandie that was of the yerly
value of     [65.1] mark. The grete importune lossez and damages that he
hath had seth he came into England, whych hys evylle wyllers the
officers and servauntes of the Duc of Suffolk have, be thout [_without_]
cause resonable, made hym leese, as in causyng hym to be disseised
wrongysly of iiij. of hys maners of Dedham, Beyton, Bradwell, Hykelyng,
and Tychewell, to the value of ij^{c}. [200] mark of yeerly rent; besyde
othyr damages and lossez by colours of the lawe, and by menys of
extorcions, as it may shew by a rolle of articles to the value of
vj^{ml}. [6000] markes.

NOTE

'Many of the letters in this collection,' says Fenn (iii. 261, Note 1),
'mention the disputes between the Duke of Suffolk and Sir John Fastolf
concerning different manors and estates.' This remark is made with
reference to the complaints against Suffolk in No. 309 preceding. Only
two of these letters have been seen by the present editor.

ABSTRACT[65.2]

SIR JOHN FASTOLF TO JOHN PASTON.

Sends by his servant an instruction to be engrossed, corrected by
Paston's advice, and a remembrance concerning Walsingham, which I hope
by your help 'shall be corryged.' Certain friends of yours and mine have
been here, and desire me to write to you 'for your friendship and good
will, passing all other men's.'

  [The date of this letter is quite uncertain, but it was probably
  written some time during those later years of his life when Sir John
  Fastolf resided at Caister. The signature, like some others during
  that period, is not in Fastolf's own hand.]

    [Footnote 66.1: [From Fenn, ii. 290.] This letter was attributed
    by Fenn to Humphrey Bourchier, who was created Lord Cromwell in
    the first year of Edward IV., and it was accordingly placed by
    him in that reign. The signature, however, of which Fenn gives a
    facsimile, is not that of Humphrey Bourchier, Lord Cromwell, but
    of Ralph, Lord Cromwell, who died on the 4th January 1456.]

Y aunsuerd it fyt not me to know it. God gefe hym grace of holsom

    [Footnote 66.2: [From Fenn, iii. 256.] By the reference to the
    Duke of Bedford's will as having been in dispute for twenty
    years, it would appear that this letter was written in the
    beginning of the year 1456. Bedford died at Rouen on the 14th
    September 1435.]

BOTONER TO JOHN PASTON[67.1]

SIR JOHN FASTOLF 'TO THE WORSHIPFUL LADY AND MY RIGHT WELLBELOVED
SISTER, WHYTYNGHAM.'

[Sidenote: 1456 / JAN. 20]

As all the executors of my Lord Regent, except himself, are dead, and as
he would not have her troubled in her age 'for execution of my said
Lord's goods,' nor for the evidences of his purchased lands, etc., which
were left in keeping 'with my brother your husband,' sends John Paston
and other his attorneys to common with her, and settle the matter, which
will be a great discharge for her husband's soul.

in a good aray, to the noumbre of iij^c. [300] men, all jakkid[75.1] and
in brigantiens,[75.2] and noo lord elles, wherof many men mervailed. It
was seid on Saterday my Lord shuld have ben discharged this same day.
And this day was seide, but if he hadde come stronge, he shuld have bene
distrussid; and no man knoweth or can sey that ony prefe may be hadde by

enterprinse.

The Kyng, as it was tolde me by a grete man, wolde have hym chief and
princepall counceller, and soo to be called hise chef counceller and
lieutenant as longe as hit shuld lyke the Kyng; and hise patent to be
made in that forme, and not soo large as it is by Parlement. But soome
men thinken it wil ner can otherwise bee; and men speke and devyne moche
matere of the comyng this day in suche array to Westminster. And the
Lordes speken this day in the Parlement of a greet gleymyng sterre that
but late hathe be seen diverse tymes, merveilous in apperyng. The
resumpsion, men truste, shall forthe, and my Lordes of Yorkes first
power of protectorship stande, and elles not, &c. The Quene is a grete
and strong labourid woman, for she spareth noo peyne to sue hire thinges
to an intent and conclusion to hir power.

I have seid to the bringer here of more to declare yow alle a longe. And
as for hise comyng, ye like to understande that your nevew, my Maister
Filongley, hathe laboured and doon that he cowde or myght to hise
preferraunce; but as for to make hym freman and at hise ease, to hise
profite and worship, it can not bee with owte William Lyne be here, that
boughte hise prentishode of his maister, to hise grete hurte and castyng
of bakke by ij. or iij. yere of tyme loste; and ne were it that the
maister and wardeyns of the Taillours tendre hym, be cause of yow and of
Fynynglee, hise firste maister, that solde hym to William Lyne, as weel
as the seide Lyne and Richard, shuld alle lese ther fredoms, as ye shall
more pleinly understande by the reporte of the seid Richard, &c.

This day was my Lord Devenshire at Westminstre, and shuld have apperid,
but he was countermaundid. As to youre matier of Wentworthe, the trety
contynueth, and is putte by the arbitrours in Fortescu and Yelverton,

SIR JOHN FASTOLF TO JOHN PASTON

[Sidenote: 1456 / FEB. 12]

Thanks him for the pains he takes in his 'chargeable matters,'
especially the ward of T. F., and his advice for the recovery of my Lord
of Bedford's goods. My servants Bokkyng and Barker have written to me
for writings making mention of the jewels and goods of my Lord delivered
to Sir Robert Whitingham that they cannot find there. I send, therefore,
W. Worcestre with a copy of Whitingham's account, which, however, is not
a complete statement.

Castre, 12 Feb.

_P.S._--Has just received a letter from Paston, for which he thanks him.

Ryght worchepfull Sir, I recumaunde me un to you. Leke you to wete my
Maister Fastolf compert[77.2] is spedde and demyd in the Eschequyer for
hym a yens the Kyng, wher in was crafti labour and cloos to the seid
spede, and laked no dylygence, for the matter was defused and dubble
intendementz after dyverse mennys appynyons.

Her is Williem Brandon, late Eschetour,[77.3] and wold have a _non
molestando_[77.4] for Fulthorp; and be cause ye spake to me that no mo
shuld be sued owte, and I can gete no lybarate[77.5] in that case,
therfore, as it is tolde me, he wyll have oon up on Wenteworth is
patente, and that wer to my maister bothe velleny and hurte. I pray you
send me heryn your avyse. It is no grete maistre to gader up that mony,
if it wer wele labord. I have somwhat affrayed them, and made hem spend
mony, as I wot well ye shall her therof. Ye and I been discharged of our
maynprys.

Now, Sir, for Goddis sake, as I have meved you a fore, help to sette my
maister in a worchepful dyreccion of his maters to his honour, his
profyte, and his hertis ease, that which so doon he shall have the
better leysour to dysspose hym self godly, and be sette his londs and
his goodys to the plesour of God, and the wele of his sowle, that all
men may sey he deyeth a wyse man and a worchepfull. Yf ye wyste what
worchep shuld growe to you in favour and conseyte of all men thus to do,
I wot well ye wolde be right spedy therin, for I beleve fully ye ar
ryght well wylled therto; and if owte I cowde helpe therto at myn nexte
comyng, yf I knew your entent, I wold do that I cowde. Yf it like you to
wryte your avyse in a bylle that I myght have it by Good Fryday at Seint
Benettys, Williem Norwyche wol send it theder. The Holy Trinyte conserve
you in honour and prosperite.

    been drawn up in the end of 1455, this letter probably belongs
    to the year following. The reference to William Brandon as 'late

Maister Fastolf undirstood that Fen hadde title to the maner of
Haryngby, and therfor wold he that Fen shuld have it after Maister F.
lyve; and, by liklynes, ther shall be labour made by Fenn to have
releses of Maister Yelverton, &c., but he hath not yet relesed. He can

    about the matter of my Lord of Bedford's goods, but expresses a
    wish that if he is to come, my Lord Chancellor--viz. the
    Archbishop of Canterbury--should be got to write him a letter
    about it.]

Worchepfull Sir, my reverent and right trusty maister and cosyn,
I recommaunde me to you. Lyke you to wyte that wher I have made my fyne
of Ikburgh with Nicholas Waterman, thanne beyng feodary to my Lorde of
Yorke, as the same Nicholas wil recorde, wherof sufficient writyng is
had; the which payment, so made, is sufficient in the lawe; in the which
caas noo newe feodary is chargeable nor I demaundable, but the seide
Nicholas owe to answere therof in his accompt; and if he concele, my
Lorde may have good remedy ageyns hym, and so owe to do. The which not
withstandyng, oon I trowe called Osbarn, som tyme your servant, now my
Lordis feodary, hath often meved to do I wote not, and now late hath
distreyned my cattel, and seith he wil dryve hem awey, &c., and wil have
C_s._ for fyne, wher my uncle paied xxvj_s._ viij_d._, Herry Somer
xx_s._, and so many other ded. Sir, he may do me a pety shame in
distreyning and dryvyng awey to make me hevy, and hym not glad I hoop at
the loong, but wroong shal he nor any other do me, wher I may gete
remedy by the lawe in any place throw Goddis mercy. Wherfor, sir, if he
be stille in your servyse, lyke you I myght have knowlech, and thanne if
your discreccion semith any thyng that I owe to do, by you I wil be
advertysed and ruled; and if I coude conceyve that I owe to pay ageyn,
as I understonde clerly the contrary, forsothe in right hasty seson wold
I provyde and send hym from my seid lorde a sufficient discharge for myn
more availl, that he shuld noght lose by me. And that is reson aswele,
for that I wil not, by Goddis grace be hurted by hym, nor geve hym cause
by my wil. I deserve my lordis good lordeship as wele as any other of my

JOHN BOCKYNG TO JOHN PASTON[84.1]

_To my worshipful maister, John Paston, Squier._

[Sidenote: 1456 / MAY 8]

Sire, please it your maistership to wyte that on Wednesday, the v. day
of Maij, I received a lettre from you by the prestis man of Walsyngham,
and the Ascencion Day,[84.2] in the mornyng, I received a lettre from
yow bi the handes of John Frays, my maisteris man, in whiche bothe moche
thinge is conteyned whiche alle at this tyme I may not answere un to my
comyng the nexte weke. And as to our atteynte,[84.3] the Chief Justice
hathe, sithe this day sevenyght, kept the Gildehalle in London with alle
the Lordes and Juges, sauf one in eche place. My Maister Markham
yesterday rode owte of London be tymes. Notwithstandyng we called ther
upon, and hadde at the barre Chokke,[84.4] Letelton,[84.5] Jenney,[84.6]
Illyngworth,[84.7] John Jenney, and Dyne, and remembrid the longe
hangyng and the trouthe of the matier, with the grete hurte of the
partie in the tyme; and we have rule the next terme betymes, and non
otherwise, for to morwe the juges sitten ayen in the toune. Mayster
Yelverton can not be myry for Wyrmegey, and as for the distresse, it is
a _non omittas_, and therfore Poley may and wil retorne what isseus he
will. If thei be smale, we shall suffre at this time; if thei be grete,
we must appere for Wyngfelde; and moche labour we have to conceyve a
goode warant of attorney. We shal plede the next terme, for as at this
tyme we wold on Monday enparle and we may.

Ye must suerly entrete the shireve, for we have moche to doo with hym,
as yesterday hadde we a grete day also in th'eschequer. Myn
maister[85.1] is moche bounde to Haltofte, and there we ar assigned day
over to the next terme, and dwelle in law. Our counsail was longe or
thei come, but at the laste thei acquitte them weel. The bille was
thought not by all that stode at the barre that wer of nother partie. We
ar joyned in the sute of the obligacion in the Comon Place ayenst Jenney
and Howes. As for attachement, ye may none have withowte ye or on of yow
make your othe in propre persone before the barons. I wolde have doon
it; I cowde not be amytted. And as for other processe, it is advised
that by the cors of th'eschequer I shall take a _venire facias_ ayenst
Wentworthe, Andrews, longe Barnard, and Deyvill _ad respondendum quare
in possessionem, &c. ingressi sunt_. And we must telle where other
Coughawe or Kirkeley, I suppose; and therupon a distresse and an
attachement; nevertheles by your othe, &c., hereafter. And it is thought
good that the same men shal be in the writte of ravyshment. Jenney hath
advised us to ley it in Blithinge hundred, and I have taken of hym
names; for as for London it is to nyghe enbracerye, as ye thought well,
and soo is Middlesex. Maister Yelverton conceyvith it weel to your
entent. There are aboughte and in Suffolk but fewe men as of gentilmen
and men of substance, but if [_unless_] it be in Blithing hundre, were
Hopton is grete; but Jenney dredeth it not we may have good men at
large; and as for the hundre, he wil doo inow thereinne.

As for the tailes of iiij^{xx}_li._ [_four score pounds_], as yette we
shal doo weel inowghe and thei were contentid; or thei that shal have
the silvere, the noyse were the lesse, for it shall, in pledyng, alwey
be rehersid by our contrarie party that for x. marc we have alle that
evere ther is, &c. I can not here how Wentworthe takith this matier by
no meane; what he meneth I wote not. He is no thing pleasid with the
matier of the bille in th'eschequer. Thomas Denys come yesterday, and
none erste. I wolde Arblaster and he spoke with yow this vacacion.
I write noo more til my comyng.

As for tidinges, noon othere thanne I sent yow laste; but forthe on the
same, all is as it was with the Quene,[86.1] the Prince and myn Lord
York ar stille at Tutbury and Sandale, and my Lord of Warrewick at
Warrewick. My Lord Bukingham rode on Ascencion Even to Writell, noo
thing wel plesid, and sumwhat on easid of herte to his purpose; for the
King hathe ley in London Friday, Saterday, Sonday, Monday, Teusday, and
Wednesday remevid to Westminster agen. In alle whiche tyme, men of
London that wer chargid and sworne wolde not nor hadde noo thing
presentid sauf trespas; this day thei shal sitte ayen. The peas is weel
kepte, but the straungiers[86.2] ar soore a dradde, and dar not come on
brode. Here is alle that I knowe as yet. Our Lord Jesu be with yow.

Writen at Suthwerk the viij. day of Maij.

[Sidenote: 1456(?) / [MAY 16]]

After humble and due recommendacion, please it your gode maistership to
understand that atte makyng of this my pour letter ther were no
noveltees with us, but suche as yee understode full well afor your
departyng, except the Kyng woll in to Scotland in all maner wyse of
werre, and that my Lord of Weltshire shal be made Chaunceller. I suppose
the better is but a sclaunder, and therfore be ye avised howe ye delyver
theym as tidynges.

Also I wotte ful well where I lefte you in suche matiers as it pleassed
you to make me of your counsell, as touchyng oon matier specially; and
howe that ye said unto me whenne I desired your goode maistership to
shewe favour in suche as ye best myght yf any thing shuld be shewed _ad
lumen_, my Maister F. except; and howe that ye answered and said as it
pleassed you that I was conquered, in trouth, that shuld preve but a
full grete unstabulnes in me with more, &c. But, Sir, I pray you howe
some ever my maister rekeneth with any of his servaunts, bring not the
matier in revolution in the open Courte, for and it were ones opened
afore the Juges howe that any lettre patentes shuld be purchased of an
ante date,[88.1] and the defaute faunde in me, ye wold be a m^l.
[_thousand_] tymes avised, and my Maister F. both, or that ye wold amend
me soo much as I shuld be appered therbe. And therfor I beseche you be
well avised howe that matier be oponed for myn ease.

I was not desired to write unto you of no on persone, so God be my help,
yourself except; but I wold ye wold take avise and counsell of the
Preest that hadde you soo long under hand on Shorthursday,[88.2] whenne
I and my feleship, God thank you, hadde of you right grete chere to our
grete comfort and your grete coste, howe that the same Preest
understandeth this letter of the Gospell underwriten: 'Jesus dixit
Simoni Petro, Si peccav[er]it in te frater tuus, vade et corripe eum
inter te et ipsum solum; si te audierit lucratus es fratrem tuum. Si
autem te non audierit, adhibe tecum adhuc unum vel duos, ut in ore
duorum vel trium testium stet omne verbum. Quod si non audierit, dic
ecclesiae; si autem ecclesiam non audierit, sit tibi sicut ethnicus et
publicanus,' etc. And in another place, 'Tunc accedens Petrus ad Jesum
dixit, Domine, quotiens petevit [_peccabit_] in me frater meus, [et]
dimittam ei? usque septies? Dicit illi Jesus, Non dico tibi, usque
septies, set usque septuagesies septies.'[89.1]

My maister can doo no thing, the which shall come in open audience at
thise deies, but it shalbe called your dede. Hit is not unknoon that
cruell and vengible he hath byn ever, and for the most parte with aute
pite and mercy; I can no more but _vade et corripe eum_, for truly he
cannot bryng about his matiers in this word [_world_], for the word is
not for hym. I suppose it wolnot chaunge yetts by likelenes, but I
beseche you, Sir, help not to amend hym onely, by [_but ?_] every other
man yf ye kno any mo mysse disposed.

I canno more, but as I can or mey, I shal be his servaunt and youres
unto such tyme as ye woll comande me to sursese and leve of, yf it
please hym.

Sir, I pray you take this copy[89.2] of your statute, it is not examined
be me, for I found hit thise v. yeres pessed.

Writan in my slepyng tyme at after none, on Wytsonday. Also, Sir, yf I
have rehersed wyttyngly the text of the Gospell syngularly unto your
maistership, I beseche you to be had excused.

    [Footnote 87.2: [From Fenn, iii. 278.] The date of this letter
    is doubtful. The two pieces of intelligence at the beginning
    were certainly both false rumours, as the writer, indeed, seems
    to have suspected. Henry VI. never went to Scotland in manner of
    war, and the Earl of Wiltshire never was made Chancellor. But
    the time when those rumours seem most likely to have arisen was
    in the year 1456, when the Duke of York had been deprived of the
    Protectorate. The Earl of Wiltshire, being of the opposite party
    to York, was not unlikely to have been talked of as Chancellor,
    although the Chancellorship was given on the 7th of March to the
    Archbishop of Canterbury. As to the rumoured expedition against
    Scotland, we know that in the preceding year James II., in
    defiance of the truce, laid siege to Berwick, which offered a
    gallant resistance (Nicolas's _Privy Council Proceedings_, vi.
    248). This, however, does not appear immediately to have led to
    open war between the two countries. Diplomatic relations were
    still carried on till, on the 10th of May 1456, James II.
    despatched Lyon Herald to the King of England to declare plainly
    that the Truce of 1453 was injurious to Scotland, and that he
    did not mean to abide by it (Lambeth MS. 211, f. 146 b). No
    reply was made to this message till the 26th of July, when an
    answer was despatched by the Duke of York in the King's name
    (_see_ Rymer, xi. 383); but there can be little doubt the desire
    to punish the insolence of the Scots must have been very general
    long before.]

pocession of a distresse, and [_i.e._ if] I wold have delyvered it hym;
he seithe he dede nevyr so mad a dede, for Wentworth wold no bettyr mean

SIR JOHN FASTOLF TO JOHN PASTON, ESQ.

[Sidenote: 1456 / JUNE 18]

As to the matters on which Paston sent to him by Will. Barker to desire
his advice, Paston knows that Fastolf has put his whole confidence in
him, and begs he will do with the advice of Fastolf's learned counsel
whatever they jointly think for his weal; 'for ye know well I am so
visited by the hand of God that I may not deal with such troublous
matters, without it should be to great hurt of my bodily welfare, which
I trust ye would not desire.' If you find my Lady of York disposed to
visit this poor place, commend me to her, and tell her how it is with me
that I cannot receive her as I ought.

Castre, 18 June.

  [As it will appear a little further on that the Duchess of York
  visited Caister in 1456, this letter is probably of that year.]

ABSTRACT[93.2]

SIR J. FASTOLF TO JOHN PASTON.

[Sidenote: 1456 / JUNE 24]

To-day my cousin Sir Miles Stapleton, Sir James Braylyes, Andrew
Grygges, 'hyr resseyvor,' and Grymston have been with Fastolf at Castre,
and brought him 253 marks, which they would have paid if he had had the
obligation here. Sends therefore a letter by his servant Colyn how Sir
S. and he are agreed for its deliverance, etc. Sir S. made many strange
insinuations that the money was paid before, partly by assignment to
Clyffton, etc. On the 18th and 19th inst. 'long Bernard, with a priest
of Kent, to the number of 16 horse, hafe, at Nacton, Bentley, and other
places of F., and entered by colour of a deed of feoffment made to the
Lady Roos and others, and hafe right proud language to the farmers, that
they will obtain their intent.' Russe has written more plainly by Nich.
Colman.

'Item, I charge right greatly the matter of my Lord of Bedford for my
discharge, and for the recovery of my Lord's goods.' Begs Paston to
common with the Lord Chancellor and others about it; and desires him to
give 'mine attorney, Raulyns, and my serjeants' a warning 'to take more
tenderness' about the process of Hykelyng that has been so many years
and days driven off.

St. John Baptist's Day.

  [From the reference to 'the matter of my Lord of Bedford,' this
  letter was most probably written in the year 1456.]

    [Footnote 93.2: [_Ibid._, No. 263.]]

ABSTRACT[94.1]

SIR JOHN FASTOLF TO JOHN PASTON.

'First it is to remember that, upon St. John's day, there was Sir Symond
Brayles, chaplain of my Lady of Suffolk, and in presence of Sir Miles
Stapleton and Edward Grymston, said that the 200 marks was paid before
in the Duke of Suffolk's days.' Can prove by writings that this was not
so, and that he 'offered to put it upon my Lord Chancellor and upon one
or two of Lords of the King's council as my said Lord Chancellor will
call unto him,' that it may be known whether my Lady is wronged or
Fastolf. The L100 of the above sum was not paid by assignment to
Clyffton. Sir Simon complains that the suit was stolen against Sir Thos.
Tuddenham, and judgment given without my Lady's counsel knowing of it;
which can be disproved.

Castre, St. John Baptist's Day.

   *   *   *

'Item, I remembered Sir Simon for the restitution of my revenues of
Dedham 3 year day, and my damage of a mill put down,' etc. I paid 500
marks for the ward of Sir Rob. Harlyng's daughter for my Lord to Sir
John Clyfton, of which the Duke had no right to receive one penny, for
there was no land held of the King.

  [This letter corresponds so closely with the last that it must have
  been written the same day.]

    [Footnote 95.1: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] Dr. John Brackley, the
    writer of this letter, was a Grey Friar of Norwich, of
    considerable celebrity as a preacher. Several letters of his are
    found in this collection, written in the years 1459 and 1460.
    This, however, must be a few years earlier, as in 1459 Brackley
    writes of William Worcester in very different terms. The
    handwriting also is not so close as that of his later letters.
    We cannot, however, carry the date further back than 1455, as it
    seems that Worcester and Howes were at this time together, which
    must have been at Caister. Nor will the year 1455 itself suit
    all the circumstances of the letter, for it is evident that John
    and William Paston were also together, and as the writer asks
    John Paston to speak to Yelverton, it may be presumed they were
    in London. Now, John Paston was certainly not in London within a
    week after St. John the Baptist's Day in 1455. We have therefore
    placed the letter in 1456. It will be observed that, on the 1st
    of June in that year, John Russe advised Paston to go up to
    London.]

    [Footnote 95.2: This address is in William Worcester's hand. The
    letter itself is in Brackley's own.]

_Magistro meo venerabili Johanni Paston Armigero detui._

Dixi enim magistro meo gardiano ante meum exitum quod magistri mei
generosi et amici alii vellent me juvare pro die Jovis pro pascendo
doctores, patres ac caeteros confratres nostri provincialis capituli; et
in exitu meo consentire noluit, quia Gurnay suus socius et procurator,
frater juvenis nostri conventus et unus sacerdos simplex, curatus de
Worsted, et Bukle, cocus, super se diem praedictum assumpserunt. Et ego
dixi, 'Olim fuit modus quod unus ejusdem loci magister esset praeferendus
in tali diei eleccione. Sed unum scitote, si magistri mei certi generosi
et ego cum eis habere non potuerimus diem quem elegimus, certe pro hoc
tempore nullum alium diem habere volumus.' Utinam placeret vobis ut
magistra mea, uxor vestra, vellet mittere pro magistro gardiano, et
dicere sibi quod ipsa quaesivit a me qualem diem ego haberem pro
fratribus pascendis in tempore capituli et quod ego dixi me habiturum
illum vel certe nullum aliter. Quaecumque ego potero procurare de
pecuniis seu victualibus ego singula venderem et expendere vellem in
reparacionibus, &c. Rogo vos ex caritate ut magistrae meae matri vestrae ac
aliis amicis vestris vobis notis, insinuetis nostram indigenciam pro
faciliori relevamine capituli provincialis. Sic enim ad vestri et mei
magistri mei specialem instanciam praesencialiter habere residenciam
teneo, ut alia loca pro praesenti negocio accedere non valeam, &c. Non
plura pro praesenti sunt calamo praesentanda, nisi quod vos, vestros et
vestra Jesus Christus graciose conservet in prosperis et graciosius
dirigat in agendis. Amen.

Recommendetis me, si placeat, uxori et matri et confratribus vestris W.,
&c. et domino meo Rectori de Blofeld, utinam de Hadle, &c.; cui dicatis
quod hac nocte jacuit Colinus Gallicus cum pulcherima Amasia sua in
camera conducta per eum, &c. Utinam nunquam vigeat, &c. Ipse proponit in
vestra praesentia dicere dicto rectori satis perversa verba. Et spero
quod dominus Rector faciat de sua speciali gratia meum negocium per
Ricardum famulum suum crastina die summo mane expediendum, quia dies
ista est dies ultima, &c. Ex manerio de Castre, Sabbato circa tempus
prandii festinantissime.

    [Footnote 98.1: [From Fenn, i. 166.] This letter must have been
    written about the time Sir John Fastolf first began to make
    inquiry on what terms he could obtain a licence for establishing
    a college at Caister,--a project which he had much at heart
    during the latter years of his life. A letter from Sir John
    himself upon this subject will be found a little further on,
    dated the 18th November (No. 351), and we think it probable that
    this is of the same year, 1456.]

    [Footnote 98.2: Edward Nevill, Lord Abergavenny, was twice
    married. His first wife, to whom he owed his title, was
    Elizabeth, daughter of Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Worcester. His
    second was Catherine, daughter of Sir Robert Howard. The Lady
    here mentioned is probably the former, for though Dugdale says
    he obtained a dispensation for his second marriage in 1448, that
    date is inconsistent with the age of his son and other facts
    mentioned.]

JOHN BOCKING TO JOHN PASTON[102.1]

_To my right worshipful Maister, John Paston._

[Sidenote: 1456 / OCT. 8]

Right worshipful Sir, and my good maister, I recomaunde me to yow, and
have receyvid a lettre from yow by Sir Thomas is man, berer here of. And
as for the accions,[102.2] bothe of ravishement and th'attachement, the
declaracions ar made _tunc solvend'_ and not _solut'_, and as moche
amendid as we can or may be favour have amendid. We hadde be beguyled
and they hadde not be sen in Norffolk, for here til this day come noo
counsaill; and to have _per manus Johannis Wyngfelde_ it wole not be,
for we can not bringe it inne, and also it is to late.

And as for iiij^{xx}_li._ [_fourscore pounds_],[102.3] Fenn and I mette
with Worsop this day, and he spake soore to Fenn and me, and we put hym
overe, saying we wolde doo as moche as we myghte. I thinke verily that
Fenn wole deserve ther inne a thanke, but I can not understande hym what
he wolde be doon to, or how rewardid, for whanne I speke of it he is
desplesid, and seithe he desirith noo rewarde; but he farith as a man
wole sey he wold noo silvere, and lokith awaywardes and takith a noble.
And he hath written to yow of the matere of Sir Philip Wentworthe
touching this writte of _liberate_,[102.4] whiche is but a color and noo
warant sufficient, ner we owe not to doo no thinge that shuld obeye it,
ner the Shireve nother dothe but of favor that he dothe to hem, and hym
liste otherwise to doo, as Fenn writeth yow more pleinly. And as for a
_supersedies_ [_sic_], there lithe noon, as he seith, up on a
_liberate_.

And as for entryng in Bradwell, thei doo opyn wronge, for after myn
patent opteyned, there was a writte to sease it into the Kynges hande,
and soo it was and is. And as to your patent, it is counsailled me to
have a writte to th'eschetor _de custodia liberanda_, whiche may not be
denyed. And if we myght have _una cum exitibus a tempore mortis_, it
were a sovereigne writte. It shalbe assaied, and doo thertoo what can
lete; the fermours be promised to be saved harmeles and chargid not to
paie ony thing to them.

And as for the iiij^{xx}_li._ [_fourscore pounds_] to be sette on
Olivere is taile, I can not see it wole be, for there is noo suche
worlde to bringe it abowte. It is faire, and we can ghete it on Fulthorp
is dette by grete labor for agrement, for I drede it wole be moste agayn
us that it is of recorde soo longe unpaied. And Hue at Fenn sueth now to
Nailer to ghete owte moo _liberates_, suche as the last were to the last
eschetor. And this God graunte thei take good spede.

And as to your isseus, I shal accordyng to your lettre speke with
Gresham whanne he cometh, and the Juges and Barons bothe shalbe enformed
of the title of Wentworthe, as ye write, and how it is up on a feyned
dede upon surrender, and a patent cancelled, &c., which Fenn hath
promisid to doo.

And as to Sir Thomas matier, I write un to yow and hym joinctly what
hathe be doon therinne at this tyme. And Jesu have yow in kepyng.

Writen at Suthwerk, the viij. day of Octobre.

As to tidinges, the Kyng and the Quene ar at Coventre.[103.1] The
Counsail be ganne there yesterday, and my Lord Shrewyshbury,[103.2]
Tresorier of England, and John Wode shalb [_shall be_] Under-Tresorer.
Thus thei say in the Chequer.

BOTONER TO JOHN PASTON[104.1]

_To my Maister Paston._

[Sidenote: 1456(?) / OCT. 12]

Please yow to wete that I hafe remembred of the langage that I hafe late
lerned W. Barker had to yow and othyrs of his accomptes apposyng,[104.2]
and of that they be not hole bethyn [_between_] ws, but yn division, &c.
Sir, as I may sey yow, hyt was nevere othyrwyse, ne nevere ys lyke to
be; for now they hafe do with Lowys, he that ys next shall be yn the
same as he was yn gelosye; for when my maister comaundyth such as of
force, by reson of her occupacion, most be nere hym, to do a message to
hys felow, or question of hym, hyt shall be ymagyned amonges our
felyshyp that he doth make maters to my maister. And so it ys ymagyned
of me when I wryte lettres to London, to Bokkyng or Barker, that yn such
maters as please hem not, then it ys my doyng; yff it take well to theyr
entent, then it ys her [_their_] doyng. And yn gode feyth, so it was
ymagyned of me and othyrs that wrote, by my maister comaundment, to
Castre, to the parson of Blofeld, Geffrey Spyrlyng, and othyrs, that of
such maters as was lykyng to hem and coude be sped by help of my maister
frendes as by theyr solicytyng, then it was seyd that it was theyr
avice, labour, and doyng. And yff the maters went not to my maister
entent, ne that they coude not bryng aboute the mater, then it was
imagyned and jangled that it was my wrytyng and doyng. I bare nevere my
maister purs, ne condyt nevere chargeable mater alone of hys yn lawe,
for my discrecion ne connyng know not whate such maters menyth. I knew
nevere of _oyer_ ne _terminer_, ne rad nevere patent before, ne my
maister knew nevere the condyt of such thynges; and when he wrote of hys
grevonse to hys frendys, he commaunded no man to be endyted, for he wyst
not whate belonged to such thynges, ne the parson neyther, but remitted
it to his councell lerned. There was no man gretter at hert with hym, as
Andreus wyth Heydon, because of castyng Bradwell and Tychewell yn the
Kynges handes, and toke awey the waarde. And I came nevere at the _oyer
and terminer_.

By God, my maister lost c. marc by a seute of Margyt Bryg upon a defence
of atteynt, because a quest passed ayenst hyr of xij. penyworth lond by
yeer; and I dar sey and prefe it, my maister never spake of hyr, ne knew
hyr not, ne wrote to sew hyr at the _oyer and terminer_, as I am
remembred. Yhyt yt was well deffended, at my maister grete cost and
labour, and myne pore labour also. Yhyt ought not I, ne none such yn my
stede, beer the wyte [_blame_] wyth Sir Thomas, ne none othyr; he that
takyth the tolle most take the charge, hyt ys hys negligence that wille
take the labour more then he may awey. I wold the parson ys wellfare
asmoch as man lyvyng, to my wreched power; and yff, or when, ye hyre
onye froward ymagynacions, I pray yow gefe no credence tille ye hyre it
aunsuerd. I am eased of my spyrytes now that I hafe expressed my leude
[_ignorant_] menyng, because of my felow Barker, as of such othyr
berkers ayenst the mone, to make wysemen laugh at her foyle. Our Lord
kepe yow.

Wryt at Castre the xij. day of October.

  Your

  W. BOTONER.

I hafe and do purchasse malgre to remembre of evidenses lakkyng by
negligence, &c. And therfor I most be muet and suffre gretter losses but
[_unless_] it be othyrwyse concydered. I sende yow the copie of your
patentes,[105.1] in parchement, and I hafe remembred as well as I can
both the stuard and Bertilmeu Elys for execucion ayenst the pleggs of
your seyntuarye, carpenter (?) Snow, that evere ys disposed to breke
promysses. Foryefe me of my leude lettre wrytyng, and I pray yow laugh
at it.

    [Footnote 104.1: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] The date of this
    letter is uncertain, but must be between the years 1454 and
    1459, when Botoner was at Caister. Bocking and Barker seem to
    have been in London at the time, which we know was the case in
    February 1456; and as we have evidence that Bocking at least was
    still there in October, we may perhaps attribute this letter to
    the October of 1456.]

    [Footnote 106.1: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] This letter is dated
    by the writer in the 35th year of Henry VI., but he does not say
    in what month it was written. The 35th of Henry VI. was reckoned
    from the 1st September 1456 to the 31st August 1457. Taken in
    connection with the postscript of Botoner's letter immediately
    preceding (the date of which letter this partly confirms), it is
    not unlikely that this was written about October. Perhaps
    'Wednesday after messe' should have been 'Wednesday after
    Michaelmesse.' If so, the exact date would be October 6th.]

    granted to John Paston and Thomas Howes, by patent of the 6th
    June 1454, and for this they agreed to pay 100 marks into the
    Exchequer. But, for some reason or other, a new arrangement was
    made, and the wardship was granted by another patent, dated 12th
    December 1454, to John Bokkyng and William Worcestre, who
    offered the King 20 marks over what Paston had offered, _i.e._
    L80 in all.--See _Patent Roll_, 33 Hen. VI., p. 1, m. 10.]

ABSTRACT[109.2]

SIR JOHN FASTOLF TO JOHN PASTON.

[Sidenote: 1456 / NOV. 10]

Begs him in the end of the term to come home by Dedham, along with
William Worcester and Barker, to see to the accounts of barley and such
husbandry as is used there. As to Wighton in Yorkshire, Bokkyng reminds
me you spoke to me that my son Scrope and his father-in-law[109.3]
should have all the lyvelode of my wife's in farm, to which I agreed, or
else that Lord Vesey would have Wighton, as he once had, at a rent of
L34--much more than I make it worth yearly. Do as you think best for me.
I had rather my son Scrope had it with sufficient surety.

Castre, 10 Nov.

   *   *   *

Begs him to common with William Worcester that by means of my Lord of
Canterbury, or otherwise, Master William Clyf and others of the
executors of John Wellis may be spoken to for the recovery of great good
that William Worcester knows Wellis owed to Fastolf.

  [The date of this letter appears to be 1456. Of the years when
  Fastolf resided at Caister, it is not 1454, because in that year
  Barker could not have been in London on the 10th November (_see_ No.
  265). It is not 1455, because Worcester appears to have been at that
  time at Caister (_see_ Nos. 305 and 306). The same appears to have
  been the case in 1457, though we can only judge by a letter of the
  29th October; and although Worcester certainly was in London in
  November 1458, Sir John Fastolf was then in London with him.]

ABSTRACT[110.1]

SIR JOHN FASTOLF TO JOHN PASTON AT THE TEMPLE.

[Sidenote: 1456 / NOV. 15]

Received certain letters by Henry Hanson on Thursday last, including one
from William Barker written in Lukett's hand, and two bills of
supplication, one of which, in the name of the tenants of Cotton, he has
sent to Paston, as he has already written. John Russe and Geoff.
Spyrlyng have ridden to Cotton in consequence, and will inform Paston
how they speed. Thinks the bill 'right good and well spoken according to
the truth of their riotous demeaning.' Received at the same time a bill
written in his own name, of which he approves. Hears that young Henry
Wentworth, young Calthorpe, and young Brews were at the distress-taking,
among others. Has perfect confidence in Paston as to the treaty, and
hopes to obtain again the manor of Bradwell by some means, as clear as
he had it before his unhappy release. Hears that the Chief Justice
'rectid the matter' in Parliament before the Lords, and showed how
Fastolf was wronged in that it was untruly found by the office that he
had disseised Sir Hue Fastolf of the manor, whereas he has documents
proving a true sale. My Lady of York has been here, 'and sore moved me
for the purchase of Castre.' Begs him to devise means for the licence of
mortising of certain buildings for the foundation of a college, 'as ye
and I have commoned of before.' William Worcester can show him a copy of
one passed by the King, and signed ready to the late Chancellor
Stafford. Desires him to make himself acquainted with two chaplains
about my Lord of Canterbury and my Lord Chancellor. William Barker
writes of a general treaty, to which he can make no answer further than
he has already done to Yelverton and Paston.

Castre, Monday after St. Martin.

  [In this letter, as in the last, we have Worcester and Barker both
  in London, which, we have seen, points to the year 1456. It is clear
  also that this letter was written just before that which follows.]

SIR JOHN FASTOLF TO JOHN PASTON[111.1]

_To the worshipful and my right welbeloved cosyn, John Paston, at the
Temple, or to William Barker, at Suthwerk, be this delvered._

[Sidenote: 1456 / NOV. 18]

Worshipful cosyn, I comaunde me to yow. And where as I late wrote unto
yow in a lettre by Henre Hansson for the fundacion of my college, I am
soore sette therupon; and that is the cause I write now, to remembre yow
agayn to meve my Lords of Canterbury[111.2] and Wynchestre[111.3] for
the licence to be opteined, that I might have the morteisying withowte
ony grete fyne, in recompence of my longe servise contynued and doon un
to the Kyng, and to his noble fader, whom God assoile, and nevere yette
guerdoonned or rewarded.

And now sithe I have ordeyned to make the Kyng founder, and evere to be
prayed fore, and for his right noble progenitors, hise fader, and
uncles, me thinketh I shuld not be denyed of my desire, but the rather
to be remembrid and spedde.

Wherfore, as I wrote un to yow, I pray yow acqueynte me and yow, for the
rather spede here of, with a chapelleyn of my Lord of Caunterbury, that
in your absence may remembre me, and in like wise with my Lord
Chaunceller;[112.1] for seyng the Kyngs disposicion, and also hise, un
to the edyfyeng of God is service, it myght in noo bettyr tyme be mevid,
&c.

My Lord of Norffolk is remevid from Framlyngham on foote to goo to
Walsyngham,[112.2] and deily I wayte that he wolde come hidre.

  Your cosyn,

  J. FASTOLF.

    [Footnote 111.1: [From Fenn, i. 164.] This letter, as printed by
    Fenn, bears no date in itself, but in the editorial note at the
    foot it is dated: 'Caister, 18th of November.' Probably this
    date is expressed in the original, but has been accidentally
    omitted in the printing. If so, the year in which it was written
    must be either 1456 or 1457, and most probably the former. In
    1455 the Archbishop of Canterbury and my Lord Chancellor were
    one and the same person, which they evidently are not here; and
    in 1458 it appears by the Castlecombe MSS. that Sir John Fastolf
    was in London on the 26th November, so that he is not likely to
    have been expecting a visit from the Duke of Norfolk at Caister
    eight days before. On the other hand, if this was written in the
    year 1456, it must be remembered that Archbishop Bourchier had
    been just recently discharged of the office of Lord Chancellor,
    which was given to Bishop Waynfleet on the 11th October, and it
    is highly probable that the Archbishop had been already spoken
    to on the subject in his capacity of Chancellor.]

JOHN DORY TO JOHN PASTON [113.1]

_To my ryth wurchepfull sovereyn and master, John Paston, be this
delyveryd in hast._

[Sidenote: About 1456(?)]

Ryth wurshepfull master and sovereyn, I recomaunde me to you, besechyng
you to pardon me that I cum not to awayte up on you like as Barkere
wrote to me. For I have notable and grete causis syth the lettere cam
from hym, the qweche hath chaungyd my purpos, and be my master the
Schreve is wrytyng, on to weche I must aplie me, all excusis leyd apart.
And as for the wrytyng Barkere wrote to me, be the qweche he directyth a
gret default in my deputys for return of the _habeas corpus_ with
_ducens tecum_, ther as is none, I dar seye, for John Rede spek to all
my master Fastolfs councell to advyse hym in the return, and to have
returnyd hit after ther conceyt, and thei wuld gyf hym non advys.
Nevertheles I now understande ther entent be Barkere is wrytyng; for
thei wuld put alle juparte up on me to myn utter ondoyng, and yit to do
my trewe part in execucion of ther entent, for ye knowell my master hath
put the juparte and the losse, if any growe, to me on his part. And ther
for I may repent the tyme that ever I promysyd my trewe and good wyll to
that entent. For alle the malesse and evylwill that is owyng to me in
alle the Schere ys for that mater and non other, the qweche hath
grettely hurt me, and in tyme comyng schall hurt more. But lete them
hold me excusyd, thei schall not have my goodwill so feythfully as thei
have had, be my troweth, and I schall helpe my sefl [_sic_] as I may.
And, Sire, I be seche you, thynke not that I pyke this be waye of
qwarell, that I myth be this querell owe my good wyll to the toder part,
for thei schall never have yt in that mater, nor in non other. And for
good the qweche I have receyvyd yff be thowth I have not deservyd yt I
am abill to content yt a geyn. And on Friday nexst foluwyng I schall be
with you atte Norwich be Goddys grace, and knowe your entent in this
mater.

No more, &c., but &c.

  Be your man and servaunt,

  JOHN DORY under Schreve of Norffolk.

    [Footnote 113.1: [Add. MS. 34,889, f. 170.] The name of Dory
    occurs only once elsewhere in these letters, and then without a
    Christian name; but the person so referred to (at the end of No.
    330) is probably the under-sheriff of Norfolk; and this letter,
    which is likewise concerned with Fastolf's business, may have
    been written about the same period.]

Sire, lyke it your maistership to wete that I sende you at this tyme the
rolle of the copies of all patentes, and the appoyntement with Wentworth
laste, and also a abstracte drawen as it come simply to my remembrance.
And I shalbe with you sumtyme the next weke. All men ar owte at this
tyme, as the Parson,[114.2] Worcester, and Barker; and therfore til thei
come, I may not owte. H. Wyndesor departid on Monday, and will doo that
he can. He telleth me Lumleys patent is in his awarde, but it is of noo
force. And also he hathe Constable is ij. [_second ?_] patente, and that

maister[114.3] comaundit hym to yow.

Here hath ben Wilton with the dede of feffement yesterday, and all men
hadde ensealed sauf myn maister that now hathe ensealed, and H. Inglose
is right soory. I can no newe tidinges, but that myn maister hath put

Norwiche dieu to Heilesdon in your hande and Thomas Grene. Ye shal the

Writen at Castre, the ij. day of Aprill.

  Your owen servaunt,

    [Footnote 114.1: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] The date of this
    letter is very uncertain. In 1456 the writer dates from
    Southwark on the 8th of May, and in 1458 from London on the 14th
    of March, so that there is rather a presumption against his
    being at Caister on the 2nd of April in either of these years.
    But these points, it must be owned, are little to be relied on,
    as Bokking certainly passed to and fro a good deal between
    London and Norfolk. The date must, however, be between 1455 and
    1459. The letter has no address, but was doubtless intended for
    John Paston.]

[Sidenote: 1457 / APRIL 20]

Please you to wete that, after dew recommendacion, hyt yt so that my

hys oune particuler maters which concern not the lawe, &c.; and I am

Sir, at reverence of God, seth my maister ys fully yn wille to renew hys
fefment, that it may be do be tyme by the surest grounde that may be
had, for, be it nevyr so suerly don, hyt shall be thought lytille ynowgh
to kepe hys lond owte of trouble; and to spare for no councell ne cost
to make sure, for a peny yn seson spent wille safe a pounde. I comyned
with my broyder Spyrlyng, which seyth he wille do hys attendaunce, and
to kepe it ryzt close of the namys. Taryeng drawyth parell.

And ye meved a gode mater to the Parson and to me at your last beyng at
Castr, that my maister shud be lerned whate hys housold standyth uppon

to see by the revenues of hys yeerly lyfelode whate may be leyd and
assigned owte for that cause to meynteyn hys seyd housold, and over
that, whate may be assigned to beere owte hys plees, and also do pay for
hys foreyn chargs[115.2] and dedes of almes to a convenyent somme.

And seth the grettist ordynarye charge most be hys housold kepyng, hyt
were moste exspedyent that ye wold note well to remembre specially my
maister to do hys audyt[or]es cast up and make rollys of hys accompts
concernyng the seyd housold seth he came yn to Norffolk thys ij. yer and
half, whych was nevyr so long to doo thys xl. wynter as ye now. And it
ys pytee that hys audyt ys none ethyr wyse yn that entended; ye must
nedys, yff ye wille my maister know how hyt stand with hym yerly of hys
chargs, that thys be do fyrst, as it was allwey accustomed. My maister
wille acord it to be don, but it ys forgete throwgh negligence of men
yoven to sensualite, as Thomas Upton, me, and othyrs. My maister can not
know wheder he go backward or forward till thys be doon.

I can not elles, but ye wille not foryete thys that the audyt[or]es go

    the autumn of 1454. The date therefore is certain.]

othere accomptants that maken lyvere of provysyons of cornys and catell

    [Footnote 116.1: [From Fenn, iii. 298.] That this letter was

    getting the accounts of Fastolf's household audited, and
    mentions that his master was sending him up to London. A further
    confirmation of the date may be found in the dates of the Privy
    Seals of the 35th year of Henry VI., which show that the King
    was at Hereford during April, though he had removed to Worcester

ABSTRACT[120.2]

SIR JOHN FASTOLF TO 'MY BROTHER' WILLIAM YELVERTON, JUSTICE.

[Sidenote: 1457 / OCT. 29]

Begs him to continue his kindness especially, now that the Parson, Sir
Thomas, comes up to appear before him and other the King's judges 'by
the cruel and hasty suit of Androus and his affinity.' Hopes the process
sued by him so eagerly 'upon the unjust condemnation shall be reformed
and holpen by the attaint in chastising of perjury that reigneth so much
now a days.' It were a blessed deed if it were reformed by Yelverton.
Desires credence for 'my cousin Paston' and Sir Thomas in the matter.

    Castlecombe_ (p. 277), says it was Sir Richard Bingham, whose
    daughter Joan Stephen Scrope had by this time married. It is
    quite possible that Fastolf sent a similar message to Bingham by
    Scrope, and to Yelverton by Paston and Howes.]

_To the right worchipful and with al myn hert rigt entierly welebiloved

[Sidenote: 1458(?) / JAN. 24]

Right worshipful, and, with al myn hert, right entierly wele bilovede
brothre, I recomaunde me unto yow. And for somoche as by the Kings moste
noblez lettrez brought me late by Hagreston, oon of the gromes of his
chambre, I am desirede to come unto his Highnesse to London; wherunto
for suche grevous diseas and infirmitees as it hath liked oure Lord to
visit me with, wherof Robert Danby can at large declare unto yow, I can
ne mowe dispose me, without feynyng, by the trouth I owe unto the King,
but that therby I doubt not, I shulde not rekever, daies of my lyfe,
suche hurt as, by the reason of the said diseas, wolde grow unto me, the
which hath right fervently and sore holden me in many diversez bihalvez,
so that, sith my last comyng frome London I had not, by the space of vj.
daies togidiez, my helth.

Wherfore, brothre, I pray yow, with al myn hool hert, that it like yow
to cal tofore yow the said Robert Danby, and to take of him the vray
trouth in the premissez, and therupon to bee my good and tendre moyen,
as by your wysdome can best bee thought convenable, unto the Kinges
goode grace, for th'excuse of my nown comyng; prayng yow hertly to
certifye me, by comers bitwen, suche tidings as ye shal have in thos
partiez, with othre your good pleasir to be perfourmed at my power, as
knoweth oure Lord, to whom I biseche to ever have yow in his blissed
proteccion and keping.

  Your trew brodir, wich prayth you hertely to excuse me
    to the Kings Heghnesse.

  R. SALISBURY.

    [Footnote 121.2: [From Fenn, i. 146.] Fenn considers this letter
    to have been called forth by the summons sent by the King to the
    Lords of both parties to come to London, in the beginning of
    1458, with a view to a reconciliation. On this view, the excuse
    of illness given by Salisbury is, of course, a mere pretence,
    and, moreover, was not adhered to, for within a week after it
    was penned Salisbury actually was in London with a company of
    400 horse and 80 knights and squires (_see_ Botoner's letter of
    the 1st February). This sudden change of tactics on the part of
    the Earl seems to me hardly probable, and I see no reason why
    the letter should not refer to a genuine illness upon a
    different occasion. Nevertheless, as there is no positive
    evidence on the subject, I leave the date suggested by Fenn,
    with a query, on which the reader may use his own judgment.]

    [Footnote 124.1: [From Fenn, iii. 40.] As there is no distinct
    evidence of the date of this letter, I have placed it after
    another paper written by Agnes Paston, and making mention of
    Clement, though I rather suspect it may be a little later. It
    certainly cannot have been, as Fenn supposes, written within a
    short time after William Paston's death in 1444, as Clement
    Paston was then only two years old. From some of the expressions
    we might be led to suspect that John Paston was in trouble at

WILLIAM BOTONER TO SIR JOHN FASTOLF

[Sidenote: 1458(?) / [FEB.]]

You shall know the governance here on Paston's coming to you better than
I can write. The King is gone to Berkhamstead, 'and it is said my Lords
Somerset, Exeter, Clifford, and Egremont, that rode upon Thursday last
to the King, they come again to London; and the Lord of Northumberland
is come to the King at this time after the Lords' departing out of
London with 3000 or 4000 people, as it is said, but all toke (?) to a
good peace, and reconysances made to keep the peace in great sums till
Michaelmas, that in the mean time to make a throw peace final by means
of all the Lords.' John Vyncent of Bentley was at the Priory of Lewes in
Sussex this week, and says that sixty sail of Frenchmen were sailing
before the coasts, keeping the sea. The Lord Fauconberg is at Hampton
with his navy. Edmund Clere of the King's house has heard from a soldier
of Calais that Crowmer and Blakeney is much spoken of among Frenchmen.
'The King's safe conduct is not holden but broken, as it is voiced here,
and that will do no good to merchants till it be amended.' Figs and
raisins are dear at 18_s._ the croc (?), 'wherte' at 10_s._ the qr.,
malt 5_s._ Remains here awaiting for the com[ing of your] officers of
Castlecombe to bring up your money. Expects to send L40 by Master
Paston. .  .  .  . (_Mutilated at the bottom; date lost._)

  [The King was at Berkhamstead in the end of June and beginning of
  July 1450; also on the 3rd March 1453 (from Reading, whither he
  returned immediately); also in February and March 1458 (from 20th
  February to 13th March). This letter must have been written in
  February 1458.]

    Protector; and it is not likely to have been under Somerset's
    rule or in the reign of Edward IV. If 1458 was the year, the day

JOHN PASTON AND T. HOWYS[129.2] TO FASTOLF AT CASTRE

[Sidenote: 1458 / MAY 24]

Yesterday 'I and other of yours' were at your manor of Bentlay--a right
fair manor, in the shrewdest rule and governance. You have had many
officers there who, for ill-will, have put out the tenants, and let the
lands to your hurt. Some owe for six, some for seven years, etc.

Yesterday Harry Sotehill, of your learned counsel, was with us, and has
taken ways in the law, etc. As Barker sends word that the attaint held
not, we shall stay the longer. The Lord Egremont sent for my brother,
and told him 'he would see you homeward, as he supposed.' Take care,
therefore, you make no more grants, for you have made too many. Could
let Bentlay, with surety, for 500 marks a year; but will not venture,
because of the trouble of letting Wyghton, 'and also till Scrope hath
spoken with you,' who will be with you now, etc.

HENRY WYNDESORE TO JOHN PASTON[131.1]

_To my full speciall gode Maister, John Paston._

[Sidenote: 1458(?) / [AUG. 27]]

Worshipfull Sir, and my full speciall goode maister, after humble
recommendacion, please it you to understand that such service as I can
doo to your plesir, as to myn understandyng, I have shewed my diligence
nowe this shorte season sithen your departyng, and in especiall aboute
suche a copie of a foundacion as your maistership commaunded me to gete
you a copie of, of the which I sende unto you at this tyme, by my broder
William Worcestre, iij. copies writen by Luket, because I had no leisir,
but somoch besems in settyng forth my Maistr of the Rolles.[131.2] At
this tyme, and in all this Kyngs deies, ye can have noon oder accordyng
any thing to your entent.

And as for the names of the Poles,[132.1] William hath more wrytyng than
ye and I coude fynde, foundon by labor made by hym and me. And also,
Sir, he hath caused me to examyn olde and mony records, writen by some
Frenshman, concernyng the manour of Dedham; that was a comborous labour,
for these copies were full defectif, as it apereth by the correctyng of
them.

Item, Sir, I may sey to you that William hath goon to scole, to a
Lumbard called Karoll Giles, to lern and to be red in poetre or els in
Frensh; for he hath byn with the same Caroll every dey ij. tymes or
iij., and hath bought divers boks of hym, for the which, as I suppose,
he hath put hymself in daunger to the same Karoll. I made a mocion to
William to have knoen part of his besines, and he answered and seid that
he wold be as glad and as feyn of a good boke of Frensh or of poetre as
my Mastr Fastolf wold be to purchace a faire manoir; and therby I
understand he list not to be commynd with all in such matiers.

Item, Sir, as for any tidings, William can tell you here at London ar
but full fewe; but Henry Bourgchier is ded sodenly at Ludlowe; my Lord
of Caunterbury and my Lord Bourgchier shall be this wyk at Hunnesdon,
and hunte and sporte theym with Sir William Oldhall.

At this tyme nothyng els to your maistership; but and it please you to
remembre my maister at your best leiser, wheder his old promise shall
stande as touchyng my preferryng to the Boreshed in Suthwerke. Sir,
I wold have byn at a noddr place, and of my maisters owun mocion he said
that I shold sett uppon the Boreshed, in the which matier I reporte me
to William Worcestre, Bokkyng, and William Barker, and most specially to
my maisters awun remembraunce.

I know full well ther cann noo conclusion be taken to myn asayle
[_avayle ?_] without help of your maistership, unto the which I utterly
submitte me in this, and in all oder. And our Lord Jesu preserve you and
all youres, and send you your herts desire with right.

Writen at London on Sonday next after Seynt Bartholomu Dey in hast.

By your servaunt,

  HENRY WYNDESORE.

    [Footnote 131.1: [From Fenn, i. 170.] At the date of this
    letter Sir John Fastolf must have been in Norfolk, and William
    Worcester in London. From the time that the former went into
    Norfolk in 1454, till the end of the year 1457, Worcester seems
    generally to have resided with him; but in the beginning of 1458
    he was in London, and it appears by the Castlecombe MSS. (Add.
    MS. 28,208, B.M. pp. 39, 42) that he was holding courts at
    Castlecombe in Wiltshire in June and July of that year, and
    that, in November of the same year, he and Fastolf were both
    together in London. It is probable, therefore, that he was in
    London in August, before Fastolf had come up. Indeed, he appears
    not to have returned to Norfolk till January following; so that
    in August he might quite well have devoted himself to the study
    of French in the expectation of a lengthened stay.]

ABSTRACT[138.1]

SIR JOHN FASTOLF TO JOHN PASTON AND SIR THOMAS HOWES, PARSON OF BLOFELD

[Sidenote: 1459 / APRIL 13]

As you desire me to write letters to certain lords, etc., on 'such
matters as ye beth now to London for,' and as you know best what it
would be most expedient for me to write, I send my servant Colyn Newman
to you with my signet sealed in a little leather bag, under a signet of
a ram, that you and William Jenney, or two of you, may make out letters
in my name as you think fit, keeping copies of those you write. When Sir
Thomas comes home again, let him bring back my signet sealed under your
signets and the copies you have sent. 'And also peradventure I might as
well write to them that ben away as to those that been present. And
among others ye may say to my nephew, Henry Filongley, I trust right
greatly in my Lord Treasurer's good Lordship that he will be my good
Lord's supporter to me in my right.'

_Tho my ryth worschopfful hossebond, John Paston, in hast._

[Sidenote: 1459 / APRIL 29]

Rythe worchepfwl hosbond, I recommawnd me onto yow. Plesyth you to wete
that on Thorisday last was ther wer browt unto this towne many Prevy
Selis, and on of hem was indosyd to yow, and to Hastynggs, and to fyve
or sexe odyr gentylmen; and anodyr was sent onto yowr sone, and indosyd
to hym selfe alone, and asynyd wythinne wyth the Kynggys howyn hand, and
so wer bwt fewe that wer sent, as it was told me; and also ther wer mor
specyal termys in hys then wern in oderys. I sey a copy of thoo that wer
sent onto odyr gentylmen. The intent of the wrytyng was, that they
sshuwlde be wyth the Kyngg at Leycester the x. day of May, wyth as many
personys defensebylly arayid as they myte acordyng to her degre, and
that they schwld bryng wyth hem for her expensys for ij. monythis. As
for the lettyr that was indosyd to yow and to odyr, it was delyveryd to
Welyam Yelvyrton, for ther aperyd no mor of the remwlawnt. Hastynggs is
forthe into Yorke schyr.

I prey yow that ye vowchesaf to send word in hast how ye wyl that yor
sone be demenyd herin. Men thynk her, that ben yowr wel wyllerys, that
ye may no lesse do than to send hym forthe. As for hys demenyng, swn ye
departyd, in god feythe, it hath ben ryth good, and lowly, and delygent
inn ovyr sythe of yowre servawntys, and odyr thinggys, the whiche I hope
ye wold abe plesyd wyth, and ye had be at hom. I hope he wyl be well
demenyd to plese yow heraftyrward. He desyryd Alblaster to bemene[139.1]
to yow for hym, and was ryte hevy of hys demenyng to yow, as I sent yow

As for alle odyr tynggys at hom, I hope that I and odyr schal do howr
part ther inne, as wel as we may, bwt as for mony it comyth bwt slowly.
And God have yow in hys kepyng, and sen yow good sped in alle yowr

  Be yorys,

  M. P.

    [Footnote 138.2: [From Fenn, i. 174.] The only years during the
    married life of John and Margaret Paston (except when their
    eldest son was a mere child), in which the Sunday preceding
    Ascension Day fell some time before the 10th of May, were 1456
    and 1459. In the former year the King could not either have been
    or have intended to be at Leicester on the 10th of May. In 1459
    the Privy Seals show that he was at Northampton on the 14th,
    18th, and 19th of May, and it is quite possible he may have been
    at Leicester on the 10th. In 1464 Edward IV. was at Leicester in
    May, and the Sunday before Ascension Day was the 6th of May; but
    it is not probable this letter was written in that year, for two
    reasons. In the first place, Margaret Paston could hardly have
    hoped for an answer from her husband--who may be presumed to
    have been in London--in time to have sent his son to be at
    Leicester on the 10th; secondly, Letter 375, which is evidently
    of the same year as this, would probably have been signed 'John
    Paston, K.' (_i.e._ Knight).]

    not apprehended the phrase, which he has modernised 'to

    [Footnote 140.1: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] The writer of this
    letter was put to death at Calais on the 25th June 1460, having
    been taken at Sandwich when about to go thither in aid of the
    Duke of Somerset against the Earl of Warwick. The date cannot be
    in that year, and how much earlier it may be is quite uncertain,
    unless we suppose 'mon petit homme d'armes' to be Paston's
    eldest son, who, as we have seen, was summoned to perform
    military service in 1459.]

    the living of Rendlesham on the 20th June 1459 on the King's
    presentation. This letter must have been written four days later
    in ignorance of the fact. Clerk's predecessor was John Sybton,

SIR JOHN FASTOLF TO JOHN PASTON

[Sidenote: 1459 / JULY 3]

'Hit is to remember my cousin, John Paston, that where as he desired to
have the names of the new feoffment of the manor of Dedham that William
Geney might see to ground such matter upon as might be for the surety of
the said manor, I sent a copy of the said feoffment by John Daunson the
last week.' Gives other points of information asked for. Has caused the
patent to be written and sealed for Rauff Alygh's fee. Paston is to
oversee the evidences of Fastolf's tenement by St. Olave's Church, which
one Laurence Donne has summoned. Philip Grocer on London Bridge is a
great maintainer of Donne. As to the matters moved by Stephen Scrope and
Richard Byngham has lately written by Daunson 'to my said cousin' and to
William Yelverton of his intent, and given them full power to appoint
with them.

  (_Signature not his own._)

Castre, 3 July 37 Hen. VI.

Would like Paston and Hue at Fenne to see a speedier mean for the
recovery of the 300 marks adjudged to Fastolf to be received of the Lady
Fulthorp for the ward of Thomas Fastolf.

    is unmistakably that of Brackley, to whom he attributes it. The

    'Littera fratris Doctoris Brackley per quam patet Jo. Fastolf
    valde desiderasse presentiam consanguinei sui Jo. Paston.' The

_To my worshipful and right gode mayster, John Paston, Squyer._

Wurshipful sire, and my right gode mayster, I recomaunde me to zou, and

zour sone to Sporle with suych felaship as ze dede, for which I am ever

be cause theroffe I caused my lady to wryte a specyall lettre to my Lord
Scales. But for al that Blake hath hoom the corn in my Lady of Suffolkys

    [Footnote 146.1: [From Fenn, iv. 38.] This letter is referred by
    Fenn to the beginning of Edward IV.'s reign, but on a careful
    examination I think it must be earlier, as William Jenney's
    proceedings, even in the first year of Edward IV., were by no
    means friendly to John Paston. The Lord Scales here mentioned
    must therefore be the Lord Scales of Henry VI.'s time, who was
    murdered in July 1460, and the letter, having been written in
    August, cannot be later than 1459. In that year, as will be seen
    by Letter 377, John Paston's eldest son had already begun active
    life, and I am inclined to think that it is the precise year in
    which the present letter was written. John Paston, the second,
    was at that time not more than nineteen years of age, and we
    hear nothing of his doings earlier. The manor of Sporle was
    inherited by John Paston, senior, from his father the judge.]

SIR JOHN FASTOLF'S WILL[163.1]

Anno Domini [millesimo][163.2] quadringentesimo quinquagesimo nono,
mensis Novembris, videlicet, die Sabbati proximo post Festum Omnium
Sanctorum, Johannes Fastolffe, miles, de com' Norfolk, Norvicen' dioc',
in manerio suo de Castre, dict' dioc', suum condidit testamentum, et
ipsius ultimam declaravit voluntatem, prout sequitur:--In primis,
commendavit et commisit animam suam Deo Omnipotenti, Creatori suo, ac
gloriosae Virgini Mariae, matri Domini nostri Jesu Christi, et omnibus
Sanctis. Item, legavit corpus suum, postquam ab hac luce migraverit,
sepeliendum in ecclesia conventuali monasterii Sancti Benedicti in
Hulmo, Norvicen' dioc', sub arcu novae capellae per ipsum ibidem de novo
constructae, ex parte australi chori sive cancelli, sub tumba marmorea,
juxta corpus Milicenciae olim consortis suae ibidem sepultae; ac voluit
quod abbas et conventus monasterii praedicti, antequam corpus suum ibidem
sepeliretur, securitatem facerent quod dabunt et concedent Johanni
Paston et aliis per ipsum nominandis, licentiam dandi et concedendi
septem monachis vel presbyteris et eorum successoribus in quodam
collegio apud Castre praedict' per praedictum Johannem Paston stabiliendo
et dotando, terras et tenementa quae idem Johannes Paston et alii
feoffati per ipsum Johannem Fastolf seu suos feoffatos de dictis abbate
et conventu tenent, vel tantum inde quantum idem Johannes dictis
monachis vel presbyteris dare voluerit. Item legavit, ordinavit, et
praecepit omnia debita sua fideliter persolvi et quaecumque per ipsum
forisfacta de quibus constare poterit, emendari, restitui,[164.1] et
satisfieri cum effectu. Item legavit ad reparationem et sustentationem
portus villae Magnae Jernemuth', ac ad renovationem et sustentationem
murorum dictae villae pro bono commodo reipublicae, salva tuitione villae
praedictae et patriae adjacentis, centum marcas sterlingorum, sub
conditione quod burgenses seu gubernatores dictae villae sine mora seu
dilatione perficiant[164.2] reparationem portus et murorum praedictorum
quamdiu dicta summa a se extendet, ut gentes ibidem commorantes habeant
animam suam in suis orationibus specialiter recommendatam. Item,
cuilibet ecclesiae parochiali singularum villarum in quibus habuit, aut
aliquis ad suum usum habet, domum seu manerium, terras, et tenementa pro
speciali recommendatione animae suae, unum vestimentum de serico panno pro
missis ibidem celebrandis, et quod fiat in eodem scutum armorum suorum
brodinatum secundum discretionem executorum suorum et indigentiam
dictarum ecclesiarum. Item, legavit et ordinavit servientibus[164.3]
suis et familiaribus domesticis remunerationem condignam seu competentem
de bonis suis mobilibus juxta statum suorum [_sic_] ad summam tres
centum marcarum, ita quod quilibet generosus habeat duplicem ad
valentiam, et sic descendendo successive juxta statum eorum seu
exigentiam meritorum ministrorum suorum ac fidelium laborum, habita
tamen consideratione ad certos servientes[164.4] circa personam suam
attendentes diebus et noctibus in laboribus, angustiis et vigiliis, tam
in sanitate quam in infirmitate, circa praeservationem corporis sui ac
sanitatem celerius obtinendum. Item, legavit cuilibet ordini Fratrum
religiosorum et domorum Mendicantium, tam in villa Magnae Jernemouth quam
in civitate Norwici, pro recommendatione animae suae, summam competentem
secundum discretionem executorum suorum limitandum, cum nihil in proprio
habeant unde sustentari valeant nisi de caritate et elemosina devotorum
Christianorum. Residuum vero omnium bonorum suorum mobilium legata sua
excedentium, ac catallorum suorum vivorum et mortuorum, ac debita
singula quae sibi debeantur, dedit et legavit executoribus suis
infrascriptis juxta modum, formam et potestatem eisdem per eum superius
limitatam, specificatam et ascriptam, ut ipsi eisdem modo et forma, per
inde omni pondere discretionis et sani consilii, ea distribuant pro
salute animae suae inter maxime debiles et pauperes, claudos et caecos, ac
alios impotentes in eorum lectis decumbentes, se et suos sustentare
commode non valentes; habita consideratione speciali ad pauperes de
consanguinitate et affinitate sua intimos et propinquos, et praesertim in
locis ubi quondam possessiones, praedia, redditus et sua dominia fuerunt
situata, et praesertim in villis et locis ubi habent, seu aliquis ad usum
suum habet, dominia, maneria, terras, tenementa, et etiam ad
emendationem pauperum ecclesiarum villarum praedictarum, viarum turpium
et pontium communium reparationem, et in aliis piis elemosinariis usibus
et caritatis operibus, specialiter in comitatibus Norfolk' et Suffolk';
et quod circa funeralia et legata sua ac elemosinas supradictas primo
anno post decessum suum mille marcae seu mille librae disponantur, et
annuatim postea quingentae librae, triginta tres librae, sex solidi et octo
denarii, quousque bona sua mobilia et pecuniae de venditione terrarum ac
bonorum suorum vendendorum provenientia modo et forma praedictis plenarie
disponantur, sicut coram Deo in die extremo Examinis voluerint
respondere; et ad hoc eos exhortabatur in Domino Jesu Christo taliter
pro[165.1] ipso singula fideliter peragere vellent cum pro eis in casu
consimili faceret juxta conscientiam, rationem, et justitiam. Et
praedicti testamenti ac ultimae voluntatis suae suos executores ad
exequendum, disponendum et ministrandum modo et forma per eum inferius
limitatis et subscriptis, constituit, ordinavit, fecit et elegit
Willelmum Wintoniensem episcopum; Johannem, Dominum de Beauchamp;
Nicholaum, abbatem de Langle; Johannem Stokes, legum doctorem; Fratrem
Johannem Brakley, doctorem theologiae; Willelmum Yelverton, unum
justiciariorum Domini Regis; Johannem Paston, armigerum; Henricum
Filongley, armigerum; Dominum Thomam Howes, presbyterum; et Willelmum
Worcester; quos modum et formam executionis et administrationis bonorum
suorum per executores suos fiend' sic limitavit, voluit, disposuit, et
modificavit; videlicet, quod praedicti Johannes Paston et Thomas Howes
solum et ante alios executores praedictos subeant et habeant
administrationem et dispositionem omnium bonorum mobilium, catallorum ac
denariorum ex venditione omnium terrarum et tenementorum suorum
vendendorum et proficuorum eorundem terrarum et tenementorum
provenientum, ut ipsi duo soli ea disponant pro salute animae suae, et
quod alii executores supradicti abstineant se ab omni administratione
dictorum bonorum suorum, nisi pro modo, forma, causa, loco, et tempore
quibus per ipsos Johannem Paston et Thomam Howes ad eorem juramenta pro
dicta administratione fuerint evocati pariter et rogati; et quod nullus
dictorum aliorum executorum suorum sine consensu et voluntate ac
advisamento dictorum Johannes Paston et Thomae Howes capiat aliquid seu
distribuat de bonis suis mobilibus et catallis praedictis, nec
venditionem eorundem neque terrarum nec tenementorum praedictorum faciat,
nec aliqua sibi debita recipiat, neque aliquos creditores suos quovis
modo acquiet et, neque, praedictis Johanne Paston et Thoma Howes
viventibus et administrare bona sua volentibus, aliquis alius executorum
praedictorum administrationem bonorum suscipiat suorum, sed quod quantum
dicti alii sui executores ad [_sic_] eorem singuli praedict' Johanni
Paston et Thomae Howes in quibuscunque egibilibus [_sic_] quae hujusmodi
testamentum et ultimam voluntatem concernentibus, favorabiliter
assistant et succurrant cum per eosdem fuerint ad hoc requisiti. Voluit
tamen quod si alter praedictorum Johannis et Thomae recusaverit onus
administrationis bonorum hujusmodi subire, vel ante administrationem
functam obierit, quod tunc ille dictorum duorum executorum suorum
administrare volens eligat unum de executoribus praedictis sibi
associandis quem putaverit in hiis sibi magis idoneum, et ita voluit
fieri de omnibus aliis executoribus praescriptis; videlicet, quod uno
moriente vel deficiente de duobus, alter loco ipsius ad electionem
administrationem incumbent' substituatur et assumatur. Si autem ambo
executores praedicti onus recusaverint subire administrationis praedictae,
vel ambo executores administrationem incumbentes moriantur antequam
substituantur executores alii, voluit quod tunc illi duo executores
viventes praedictam administrationem subeant et habeant quos major pars
executorum viventium sui testamenti duxerit eligendos, et quod illi duo
administrationem subeuntes ad dictos Dominum Episcopum et Dominum de
Beauchamp, Nicolaum Abbatem de Langley, Johannem Stokes, Fratrem
Johannem Bracley, Willelmum Yelverton, Henricum Filongley, et Willelmum
Worcester recursum habeant pro eorum consilio et advisamento obtinendo
in causis arduis et materiis requisitis. Supervisores vero dicti
testamenti reverendissimum in Christo patrem et dominum, Dominum Thomam
Dei gratia Cantuariensem Archiepiscopum, Walterum Episcopum Norwicensem,
Magistrum Robertum Popy clericum, et Hugonem Fenn, Domini Regis
auditorem, ordinavit et constituit, et voluit quod dicti duo executores
onus administrationis subeuntes remunerarentur secundum merita laborum
suorum et diligentiam in praemissis expediendis juxta discretionem dicti
Domini Episcopi Wintoniensis et Magistri Johannis Stokes, seu majoris
partis aliorum executorum viventium. Supervisores vero praedicti et
caeteri executores remunerarentur secundum merita laborum suorum per
discretionem duorum executorum dictae administrationi incumbentium. Et
voluit quod si quis praedictorum per eum superius nominatorum dictos
Johannem Paston et Thomam Howes in officio suo hujusmodi seu circa
administrationem bonorum ejusdem defuncti quoquomodo impediverit,
turbaverit, vexaverit, molestaverit, vel inquietaverit, aut aliquid
praedictorum facere praesumpserit vel conatus fuerit, ab administratione
bonorum suorum omnino removeatur, et si quid praemissorum ante
susceptionem administrationis hujusmodi attemptaverit, ipsum ad
administrationem hujusmodi nullatenus admitti voluit et declaravit.
Datum anno Domini, mense, die, loco supradictis.

FASTOLF'S COLLEGE[189.1]

Ultima exitacio domini Johannis Fastolf ad concludendum festinanter cum
Johanne Paston fuit quod vicecomes Bemond, Dux Somerset, comes Warwyk,
voluerunt emere, et quod intendebat quod executores sui desiderabant
vendere et non stabilire colegium; quod totaliter fuit contra
intencionem sui dicti Johannis Fastolf; et considerabat quod certum
medium pro licencia Regis et dominorum non providebatur, et sic tota
fundatio colegii pendebat in dubiis; et ideo ad intencionem suam
perimplendam desideravit dictum barganium fieri cum Johanne Paston,
sperans ipsum in mera voluntate perficiendi dictum colegium et ibidem
manere ne in manibus dominorum veniat.

Item, plures consiliarii sui dixerunt quod licet fundaret regulos seu
presbiteros, aut eicientur per clamia falsa aut compellantur adherere
dominis pro manutinencia, qui ibidem ad costus colegii permanerent et
morarent[ur] et colegium destruerent; et hac de causa consessit eos
ditari in pencionibus certis ad modum cantariae Heylysdon, sic quod
dictus Johannes haberet ad custus proprios conservacionem (?) terrarum
erga querentes et clamatores; et ne executores diversi propter
contrarietates et dissimulaciones se favores----[190.1]

Item, considerabat quod ubi monechy et canonesi [_monachi et canonici_]
haberent terras seu tenementa ad magnam [_sic_] valorem, scilicet m^l.
[1000] vel ij. m^l. [2000 _sc. librarum_], tam singulares monachi et
canoneci tantum per se resiperent [_reciperent_] xl_s._ per annum et
prandium, et quod abbas, officiarii et extraequitatores expenderent
residuum in mundanis et riotis; et ideo ordinavit dotacionem praedictam
in annuetatibus.

Et quod non fuit intencio dicti Johannis Fastolf in convencione praedicta
mortificare CCC. marcas terrae, quia prima convencio Johannis Paston est
solvere v. m^l. [5000] marcas in tribus annis et fundare colegium quod
in intencione dicti Johannis Fastolf constaret m^l. [1000] libr., et
semper dedit Johanni Paston mancionem suam in manerio et tota terra
[_sic_] in Northefolk et Southefolk assessa ad v. C. [500] marcas
annuatim, tunc Johannes Paston emeret revercionem CC. marcarum terrae quae
valet iiij.[190.2] m^l. [4000] marcas ad suam propriam adventuram pro
vj. m^l. v. C. [6500] marcis.

Item, pro tranquillita[te] et pace tempore vitae, ita ut non perturbetur
per servos hospicii, ballivos, firmarios seu attornatos placitorum.

Item quod abbas de Sente Bede[191.1] potuit resistere fundationi,
intentione ut tunc (?) remaneat sibi et suis.

    [Footnote 195.1: [From Fenn, iii. 346.] This letter belongs to
    the latter part of the year 1459. After the dispersion of the
    Duke of York's army near Ludlow in October of that year,
    commissions were granted to various persons to arrest and punish
    his adherents. Even as early as the 14th of October, Lord Rivers
    and others were commissioned to seize their lands and goods in
    different counties (see _Patent Roll_, 38 Hen. VI., p. 1, m. 12,
    _in dorso_). But this letter, we are inclined to think, was
    written about six or seven weeks later, for it will be seen by
    the next that Bocking, who is here stated to have been with my
    Lord Chancellor 'this term,' must have been in attendance on him
    before the 7th December, and therefore, we may presume, during
    Michaelmas term, which ended on the 28th November. It is,
    however, difficult to judge, from the very slender allusion to
    Sir John Fastolf, whether this letter was written before or
    after the old knight's death. Brackley here speaks of having
    been quite recently in Somersetshire, which is not unlikely to
    have been in the middle of October, when the Earls of March,
    Warwick, and Salisbury withdrew into the West. Brackley, as will
    be seen, was a great partisan of these Lords, and may very well
    have accompanied them; but not long before Fastolf's death he
    appears to have been at Norwich.]

ABSTRACT[202.1]

G. SPERLYNG TO JOHN PASTON

[Sidenote: 1460 / JAN. 6]

Paston was misinformed as to what Sperlyng said of his late
master's[202.2] will. What he said was that about Hallowmas was
twelvemonth he was about eight weeks with his said master, who one day
examined him about the conveyance of his lands, and said there was no
man of worship in Norfolk had so many auditors as he, yet he could never
get the certainty how his livelode was disposed; but he had found a
means to be quiet, 'whereof,' he said, 'I am as glad as a man had geve
me 1000 mark,' by granting his cousin Paston all his livelode in Norfolk
and Suffolk, on condition he should amortise sufficient lands to
maintain a master and six secular priests at Castre. Paston was to take
the risk of any counter claim and trouble hereafter, etc.

Norwich, Epiphany Day.

  [The date of this letter must be 1460, as it is after Fastolf's
  death, and speaks of a conversation the writer had with him about
  the management of his lands a twelvemonth before Hallowmas preceding
  the date of the letter. At Hallowmas 1459 Sir John was dying, and
  quite unable to support any conversation for want of breath, so that
  the reference must be to Hallowmas 1458.]

    [Footnote 203.1: [From Fenn, i. 182.] The date of this letter is

    capture of Rivers and his son by John Denham. Compare the letter
    following.]

And as for my Lord Chaunceler, he was departed fro London, and was redyn

hasted hym to the Kyng by cause of my Lord Ryvers[204.3] takyng at
Sandwyche, &c.[204.4] . . . . . . . .

As for tydyngs, my Lord Ryvers was brougth to Caleys, and by for the
Lords with viij^xx. [_eight score_] torches, and there my Lord of
Salesbury reheted [_rated_] hym, callyng hym knaves son, that he schuld
be so rude to calle hym and these other Lords traytors, for they schall
be found the Kyngs treue liege men, whan he schuld be found a traytour,
&c. And my Lord of Warrewyk rehetyd hym, and seyd that his fader was but
a squyer, and broute up with Kyng Herry the V^te, and sethen hymself

Marche reheted hym in lyke wyse. And Sir Antony[204.5] was reheted for
his langage of all iij. Lords in lyke wyse.

Item, the Kyng cometh to London ward, and, as it is seyd, rereth the

more as I tolde you. And also my Lorde of Canturebury and Maister John
Stookes, his juge, had geve autorite to ministre to a certein somme till
the testament were proved. And these preseidents consedred wolde
discorage any man to a bide but a litel amonges hem that so straunged
hem self from me and mistrusted me, be thut any cauce ye knowe wele how
that my maister man servauntes were put in gretter truste and
familiarite to handell, geve, and telle out of the bagghes my maister
money bothe at Seint Benetts and in Norwich in divers places by grete
summes and litell. And ye as other my maister servauntes and I that
helped gete my maister goode and brynge it togedre were straunged, and
as it semyd by there demenyng mistrusted to oure grete vilanye and
rebuke, wheche muste be answerd the causes why, and we declared [i.e.
_exculpated_], and so shal I make it for my pore person, and for my
maister sowle heele. It is not soilied (?) knowen that I was one of the
cheeffe that kepte bothe my Maister Paston and myn oncle[206.1] in my
maister favour and truste, and if I wolde have labored the contrary, by
my sowle--that is the grettest othe that I may swere of my silff--they
had never be nygh my maister in that case they stonde nowe. And if they
woll labour to damage or hendre me, all the worlde woll mysreporte of
hem and litel truste hem, nowther they schal not have wurschip nor
profight bi it. I wolde be to them as lowyng and as wele willyng as I
gan, so I fynde cause, and other I wolnot be to my fadre, and he weere a
liffe. I requere you a[n]swere for me as I wolde and have do for you
whan som of hem have seid ful nakedly of you, and suche as ye deeme hafe
mysereported causeles of me, I pray you that they see my letter as weele
as my frendes. My maister also (God yelded is sowle) graunted to me a
liffelode accordyng to my degre, that I, my wiffe, and my childre,
schulde have cause to prey for hym. My wiffes uncle[207.1] was present
in his chapell at Castre as wele as my wiffe, and comaunded her oncle to
chese the londe. This is trowthe be the blissed Sacrament that I
receyved at Pasch [_i.e._ Easter]. And because I demaunded my right and
dwte of my Maister Paston, he is not plesed. I have lost more thanne x.
mark worthe londe in my maister servyce, by God, and not [_unless_] I be
releved, alle the worlde schal knowe it elles that I have to gret wrong.
Wolde God I kowde plese bothe Maister Paston and my oncle in reson, who
preserve you.

Wrete hastely the vij. day of Feveryere.

    his wife, addressed on the back, 'To my ryght wurschipfull
    husbond, John Paston, be this delyvered in haste.' The date must
    be 1460, as it is clearly not long after the death of Sir John

    Norwich, it was probably not many days or weeks after No. 399.]

    [Footnote 208.1: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] The date of this

    John Paston had gone to take possession of his lands in Norfolk.
    Saxthorpe was one of Fastolf's manors which so came to him. The
    year may therefore be presumed to be 1460.]

FRIAR BRACKLEY TO [WILLIAM PASTON][209.1]

[Sidenote: 1460 / [before Easter]]

Jesu mercy, Marie help, cum Sanctis omnibus, trewe menyng executorys
ffro fals terrauntes and alle tribulacyonys. Amen. Ryte reverent Sire,
&c., W. Y.[209.2] Judex and hise wyf were here with here meny and here
hors in our ladyes place, &c. on Saterday at evyn, and yedyn hens on
Monday after none, whan summe had drunkyn malvyseye and tyre,[209.3] &c.
And I prechid on the Sonday byfore hem, not warnyd tyl after mete. And
than for lak of M. Vergeant, or our wardeyn Barnard, I sodeynly seyd the
sermon. And byfore I had ryte ovyr and soleyn chere of hem bothe, &c.;
but after the sermon he seyd opely to the prior, heryng myche folk in
the chirch, 'I haf herd hym oftyn here and ellys where, but
[this][209.4] is the best that ever I herd hym sey,' &c., and at evyn
drank to me, and made me good chere, half on the splene, &c.

But on Moneday, whan he had ny etyn and drunkyn a now, he gan to rollyn
hym in hise relatyvis, and we eldyd hym, as many men thowtyn, ryte
ongayly in hise gere, &c.; hise wyf begynnyng the communicacyon with
rite a sootyr (?) chere. And he heeld on so sore he cowd not cese, &c.
tyl he went to his hors, &c. And the pryor demenyd hym gentylly in hise
talkyng. And there was not forgetyn non unkyndnesse of my Mayster J. P.,
zour brother, of sleyn [_slaying_] of hise man Wormegey, and of mariage
of hise dowghtyr, whiche now schal solempnely be maryed to
Conerys,[210.1] a knytes sone, &c. And now last at Seynt Benettes, where
he so worschipful a justise and as kunnyng in lawe as ever was zour
fadyr, &c. as alle men knowyn, &c. And zour brother J. P. brokyn owt be
occasyon of zour langage, and takyn wytnesse of Malmysbury, a man of my
Lord of Caunterbury, whiche hath spokyn with the seyd justise the last
terme in Westmyster Halle. And there he seyd more tymes than one, 'Sire,
this the fyrst tyme that ever I spake with zour Lordschip, &c.' And
sythe after ze weryn at Seynt Benettys forseyd, ze komyn not gentylly
but ryte malicyously disposid to myn Lady Felbrygg, and dede your devoyr
to haf put hym out of hir conceyt, and it wolde not be, &c. And what
vyolens my Mayster J. P., germanus vester, dede to W. Wayt,[210.2] &c.
up on hise owne grownd at Musshold, &c. And after al these materys, bare
me on hand[210.3] that I had seyd to on of the worthiest of the schyre
that the seyd justise be gan the brekyng at Seynt Benettes; for I
suppose I seyd thus to my Lord Fyz Water, _alias_ my Mayster Radclyff,
to whos in I went to, and zaf hym a potel of swete wyne, he demaundyng
me of that brekyng, &c., as I remembre me, and suppose I seyd, 'W. Y.,
justise, began to myn knowlache and understondyng.' Whan he seyd so
fumowsly, 'Who so ever sey that of me, he lyeth falsly in hise hede,
&c.' And my Mayster Radclyff rode forthe with owt of towne to Dokkyng
and Brumham, and with hym rode W. Y., sone to the justise. And yf the
seyd Radclyff teld this to W. Y., I wote never. And yf he dede I
merveyle sore. But and al go to al, as is like to go, I may not sey nay,
but I trow I seyd so. Radclyf and ze bene grete frendes. I wold ze wold
lat hym knowe the trowth, &c.

This mater mevyd the justisis wyf, and than he be gan hise mater more
boldly, seying to me be fore the pryour and miche pepyl, that it was
told hym the same day that I seyd, as for the brekyng, the justise
began. 'Forsothe' seyd I, 'whan I came into the chambre there, the fyrst
word I hard was this, that ze seyd to my mayster J. P., "Who that ever
seyth so, I sey he lyeth falsly in hise hede," &c.' 'Ya,' quod the
justise, 'ze schuld haf told what mevyd me to sey so to hym.' And I seyd
I cowde not tellyn that I not herd, &c. Et Judex-- 'Ze schuld haf
examyned the mater,' &c. And I seyd, 'Sire, it longyd not to me to
examyne the mater, for I knew wele I schuld not be juge in the mater,
and alonly to a juge it longyth to sene and stodyen illam Sacrae
Scripturae clausulam, whiche holy Job seyd, _Causam quam nesciebam
diligentissime investigabam_.'

And than, 'No,' seyth he hardyly, 'ze schal not be juge, but yf ze had
owt me as good wil as ze dede and do to Paston, ze wold than have sergyd
the cause of my gret greef, why I seyd as I seyd, &c. But I haf sey the
day, ze lovyd me beter than hym, for he yaf zow never cause of love as I
haf done,' &c. 'Sire,' I sey, 'he hath yovyn me cause swyche as I am
behold to hym for,' &c. 'Ya,' seyth he, 'ze schal bere wytnesse, &c.,
and the other Mayster Clement and W. Schipdham.' Cui ego-- 'As for the
wytnesse I schal bere, I schal say and writyn as I knowe,' &c. Cui
ille-- 'I made hise testament,[211.1] and I knowe,' &c. Cui ego-- 'I saw
nevir testament of your makyng; and as for on testament that he made,
and I knowe bothe the writer and maker, after hise wyl and intent, ze
stonde stille there in as ze dede than,' &c. Et tunc gavisus est, &c. Et
ille-- 'I knowe ze haf a gret hert, &c., but I ensure zow, the Lordes
above at London arn infoormyd of zow, and they schal delyn with zow wele
anow.' Cui ego-- 'He or they that hafe infoormyd the Lordes wele of me,
I am behold to hem; and yf they be otherwyse infoormyd, I schal do as
wele as I may. But be myn trowthe I schal not be aferd to sey as I knowe
for none Lord of this lond, if I may go saf and come, quod non credo,
per Deum, propter evidencias multas,' &c. Tunc prior-- 'Domine, non
expedit nec rationi seu verae conscientiae congruit, quod vos contendatis
cum Magistro Paston, vel ipse vobiscum, pro bonis defuncti, quae solum
sua et non vestra sunt. Miror valde,' inquit, 'cum prioribus temporibus
tam magni fuistis amici, et non sic modo, quare valde doleo.' Cui
Judex-- 'There is no man besy to bryng us to gyder, &c., so that I kan
wele thynk it were lytil maysteri.' But in feyth I knowe wele the Juge,
W. Wayte his mawment [_i.e._ puppet], hise boy Yimmys, with here hevedy
and fumows langage, have and dayly do uttyr lewd and schrewd dalyauns,
&c.

I sent zow bode of dyvers thinges be M. Roger Palle, and I haf no
answer, &c. I schuld go to Castre, and a man of my Lordes Norfolk told
here he came fro London, and there he had commonly voysid that the Duke
of Norfolk schuld be the Kynges comaundement kepe hise Esterne at Castre

ANONYMOUS TO H. B. OF LINCOLN[214.1]

_To my good Maister, H. B. of Lincoln._

[Sidenote: 1460 / APRIL 9]

Right worchepful sir, after my recommendation, like you to wete I wold
yisterday have spoken with you if ye had be allone at good leiser, for
my aquytaile to God and to you, and for the wele of my maister, God
pardon hym. I have many thynges to remembre you if ye wol. Wherof
diverse specialtes that I wold sey, I may not write. For I meved you at
your chamber wyndow at Lammes homward from London some thynges of my
good wil, and me thought ye toke it gretely to displeisur; the which
caused me to sey the lesse of thynges that had be worchepfull to have be
doon. But, Sir, as I remembred you late at Norwich of the variaunce by
twix the worchepfull man and you, for Goddes love and your most ease,
folwe the meanes of his good wil by help of holsom gentilmen, and also
the feithfull love of other that grucchen to you warde, as I fele moche
thof thei speke litil therof to you, rettyng in you singuler fastnesse
ageyns kyndenesse and reson; for with love and unyte ye shal do moost
good for oure maister to your worchep. And with the contrary many mysse
dispenses as han be and thanne moche lette in doyng of good dedis to the
causers perill and slawnder God hath sent you wysdham grete that telleth
you the best is to drede God. A man shal never have love of God nor love
nor drede of good men for myskepyng of moche good thof it wer his owen,
for it is dampnable; but wher it is truly delt with and godly disposed,
thanne folwith bothe grete meryte and worchep. Pety it is that mo more
is do for hym. At the gate is nowther mete, drynke nor money, _ut
dicitur_, no man wele spekyng thof thacte above be not do necessary
almesse to the nedy that peynen wold and myght be do dayly. And, Sir, be
ware what ye talke to som men of the lordes your coexecutours, and what
is spent for the man, and what he was worth. Thei reporten you
unfavorabely and withoute credence, as men seyn, and some I have herd.
Also your entretyng and other for you with them that have entres with
you for to have your entent sped, is tolde oute whow, and your iournay
to lorde Beauchamp to Cambrig is taken as men like, and your associacion
is seid made by your witt to your purpos. As somme fer of and grete that
may nor peraventur wiln not medle, somme ye wold thei left, somme havyng
no conduyt, somme no stomak, and somme glosours and witnesses for lucre;
this is not my seyyng, I have often herd it. Therfor to have such a post
as the seid man is that ye be in variaunce; so he do wele, as I fully
beleve, he shuld help you to bere moche, and cause eschuyng of moche of
this noyse. This variaunce grew of mater of noght and japes; the soner
may be accorde. And thynke not, Sir, that any persone hath stered me
herto; for by the good Lorde I trist to receyve this holy tyme it is my
owen steryng and good hert to you warde, for that I her and see, and
moost of your wele willers, in eschuyng of inconvenyentz as right many
talke must ensue to you ward. For I fonde you pleyn at Cristemesse, and
I toke you that ye loved me, wher to fore, withoute cause truly, to my
seid maister moch ye hyndred me, as parte he tolde me, and thanne I
praied you in that your good maistership and amendement, and sith I have
be pleyn and wol be. And I require you as ye arn a gentilman, kepe thees
maters secrete by twix God, you and me; for by Almyghty Jhesu of me
knoweth this non erthely creatur, nor shal knowe. Other thynges been
that sounden not wele, but as I fele your wisdham take me in this, so
herafter I wil demene me with you in maters. I am urke of variaunces,
for parties waxen wrooth if men hold not with there oppynyons whan thei
in angre trotte over fer by yon hem self. I may not come by you to
London ward, I trow I must by Suffolk; elles I had not writen this. Oure
Blissed Lorde have you in His governaunce and be your conduytour to His
pleisur, Amen. This Wednesday, ix. day Aprill.

As ye arn a veray gentilman, be my true confessour as I am youres and
take me as I mene, thof my termes been not discreet. Brenne this scrowe
or kepe it pryvy, as ye like and I beseche you, if ye wil trist me, wil
me pleyn, &c.--Your owen, &c., to my power.

    [Footnote 214.1: [Add. MS. 34,888, f. 143.] This letter is
    mysterious, but seems to have some bearing on Sir John Fastolf's

    1460, as the 9th April, the day it was dated, was a Wednesday,
    and one expression in it shows that it was written immediately
    before Easter, which in that year fell on the 13th April.]

[Sidenote: 1460(?) / JULY 26]

Desires them to show favour to the defendants in an appeal of robbery
sued before them out of malice by Thomas Bury against John Berney of
Redham, Norf., Junior, Esq., John Paston of Norwich, Esq., John Berney
of Redham, Norf., Senior, Esq., John Hevenyngham, of Norwich, Esq., and
Christopher Norwich of Brundehale. They are to receive no writ returned
in the name of the Sheriff of Norfolk touching that matter except by the
hands of the sheriff himself, or of John Bernarde his under-sheriff.

London, 26 July.

II. Another letter, similar in substance, in which no justices' names
are given.

  [These documents cannot be later than 1460, as the younger John
  Berney died in July of that year (see next letter). But as Judge
  Littleton was only made a King's Serjeant in 1455, they cannot be
  many years earlier, and they are not unlikely to be of the year 1460
  itself.]

    [Footnote 223.1: [From Fenn, iv. 36.] According to Fenn,
    Margaret Paston's uncle, John Berney, second son of John Berney,
    Esq. of Reedham, died in July 1461, and he accordingly places
    this letter in that year. It is evident, however, that John
    Berney was dead at the date of Nos. 431 and 462, the former
    written in January 1461, the latter certainly not so late as the
    28th July in the same year, for Thomas Denys was murdered at the
    very beginning of the month. Indeed, it is clear that in No. 462
    Margaret Paston wishes to arrange about the approaching
    anniversary of her uncle's death. John Berney must therefore
    have died in July 1460, although from the troubled character of
    the times his will (which is preserved in the Principal Registry
    at Somerset House), made on the 2nd June 1460 (Monday after the
    Feast of St. Petronilla the Virgin), was not proved till the 1st
    December 1461.]

    [Footnote 223.2: When Berney's will was proved at Lambeth, 1st
    December 1461, administration was granted provisionally to
    Thomas Hooler, who was to send in accounts before the morrow of
    the Conversion of St. Paul (Jan. 26) following. Power was,
    however, reserved of committing administration to John Paston.
    But John Paston did not appear on the day, and left the
    undivided administration to Hooler.]

Sir, please your right worshipfull maystership that Mayster Paston come
to London as on Thursdaye att none last past, and I trust verelye all
maters here were resonablye labored to his comyng, and now they shal be
better. Neverthelesse, I have ben mevid of tretye by dyvers personez
sith I came hidre, as wele for Tudenham, Wentworth, Heydon, and other at
this tyme not wel willed to yow and yourez, seyng that such money as is
spent a twix yowe is but wastfully expendid and to non use vertuouse.
I fele by theym they be not right corageous in theyr werkes, ner nought
wold if they myght have a resonable trete. I meve not this that ze shold
thenk that they had conquered me by noyans, but I do it to avertyse yow
for th'eschewyng of the importable costes that hath ben born by yow, and
yet lyke to bee, aswele in the elde maters hangyng as in newe at this
tyme to be grownded, if this werre shal rest and hold a twyx yowe, and
specially for the ease of hym that shalbe solicitour in the same. Ye
nede at this terme rather to have had thre solicitours than in any other
terme past this iij. yere, on concyderyng the maters hangyng, &c.; of
which please yow to send yowr gode advyse and wille yf ye thenk it to be
don, and els not, for this is but a mocion, &c.

    [Footnote 225.1: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] This letter is by an
    unknown writer, and very uncertain as to date. It shows that
    Tuddenham, Wentworth, and Heydon, all adherents of the House of
    Lancaster, were desirous of a compromise with Yelverton and
    Paston. The year 1460, some time after the battle of
    Northampton, is perhaps as likely a period as any.]

I schuld come there, &c. It is verifyed of hem, 1(o) Jeremiae, 8(o), _Vere

And I prey zow for Godds sake to be good mayster to Jon Lyster, &c. And
I prey zow think, in this Parlement, of the text of Holy Scripture,
_Quicunque fecerit contra legem Dei et contra legem Regis judicium fiet

exilium, vel in mortem_ (Primo Esdrae, vij., et parti 2(o) Esdrae 8(o)).

concors et valde pacificus. Utinam bona voluntas vestra non sit in hac
materia pigra, &c.

2(o). Item, quod Episcopus Norwicensis esset in curia Regis ad tempus, vel
in parliamento omnino, quia hic parvum bonum facit, nisi supportando
iniquos et paci patriae contrarios; est enim satis dives ad comprestandum
pecunias Regi in necessitate sua. Ipse enim cum ducissa Suff. et aliis
personis praenominatis sunt Reginae et principi maxime favorabiles cum
totis suis viribus; et ideo maxime expediens est parti Regis et comitis
Warwic subtrahere, diminuere, et pocius opprimere, vires omnium illorum
praedictorum eis et suis continue malignantium ex adverso, &c.

3(o). Item, vos et vestri praemunire poteritis, si placeat, Doctores Kyrry
et Godard quomodo fama communis hic volat continue per Boreales et eorum
fautores quod Regina ac sui firmiter statuerunt unanimi decreto ipsos
doctores et me non solum morti ignominiose tradere sed etiam generaliter
omnes Fratres Minores citra flumen Trent commorantes interfici facere.
Sed Magister Vergeant cum socio qui in sermonibus Reginam cum principe
solempniter recommendat et in suis missis Reginam nominatim specificat
per instanciam Ducissae Suff. erit cum socio privilegiatus ab hac
punicione.

4(o). Item, bonum esset quod juvenis dux Suff. cum suis militibus et
armigeris uteretur suis calcaribus et jam probaretur in bello cui esset
fidelis, an caro vel piscis. Si T. T. cum suis prius recitatis essent
unde memorati in parliamento a dominis et communibus, non dubium quin
puniti essent causatores insurrectionis falsorum Regis contra Comitem
Warwic apud pontem Westmonasterii, &c.

5(o). Item, memorari dignetur dominus Comes Warwic quomodo T. T., J. H.,
J. A., et H. T.,[228.1] J. W. et caeteri gravissime comminantur priorem
Wals' [Walsingham], &c.

6(o). Item, caveant Comes Marchiae et Comes Warwic ne quovis modo sit inter
eos controversia, sed sint omnino unanimes et concordes, nec aliqua
cupiditas consiliariorum suorum faveat alicui eorum adversario propter
lucrum bonorum in finalem deperdicionem ipsorum et amicorum suorum.

7(o). Item, fiat per decretum parliamenti diminutio juris peritorum ac
legis attornatorum Suff. et Norff. punicioque taxata singulorum
oppressorum, generosos ac eorum liberos, nativosque tenentes cotidie et
annuatim gravissime infestancium.

8(o). Continue ac continue cordialiter cogitate ac scrutinio diligenti
saepius revolvite quomodo inimici vestri et adversarii antiqui, spiritu
rancoris et invidiae maliciose agitati, nituntur pro posse suo, et totis
viribus, vos, et vostros vobis benevolos funditus destruere et finaliter
deperdere, quod absit omnino; quare ex naturali legis dictamine potestis
et debetis vim vi volenter ac potenter reprimere ac repellere et eorum
maliciis inveteratis virili congressu rigorose resistere, quia minus
malim incomparabiliter videtur existere quod eorum obstinata malicia
potestate politica sit diminuta et quasi dejecta quam vos et vestri
affines, propinqui et amici essetis nimis depauperati, et quasi, quod
absit, finaliter abjecti.

FRIAR BRACKLEY TO JOHN PASTON[229.1]

_Reverendo magistro meo et amico singulari Johanni Paston armigero
detur._

[Sidenote: 1460 / OCT. (?)]

Jhesus, Maria, Raphael, Johannes Baptista, Johannes Ewangelista,
Franciscus Guardianus, cum Sanctis omnibus, succurant maestis in
tribulationibus. Amen. Praecordialissime domine et amice maxime
singularis, Omissis pro praesenti vestri gratitudinis beneficiis mihi
saepius impensis, me humilime vestrae reverenciae recommendo. Pensetis,
quaeso, cum omni festinatione possibili instabilem virum, utinam
Hibernicum[229.2] non ingratissimum, cujus nacionis aliquales
proprietates sunt istae:--animo saeva, vultu ferox, torva affatu,
versupellis moribus et inconstancia in omnibus bonis viis suis; qui
inter caetera magistro Clementi retulit quod expensae annuales magistri
Johannis Fastolff, bonae memoriae, secundum fidelem compotum se extendunt
omni anno ad octingentas marcas in Norfolch et Suffolch, &c., et quod
idem miles vobiscum faciens pactum pro iiij. M^l, &c., fuit purus
fatuus; et quod idem vobis donatoriam literarum faciens fuit major
fatuus, &c., et quod idem Hibernicus scit deteriorare, et diminuere bona
militis ad summam viginti m^l marcarum, &c. Ob reverentiam Jhesu
Christi, cavete quod impediatur omnino a suscipiendo onus testamenti
quousque verum et integrum compotum reddiderit de defuncti bonis per eum
receptis tot annorum evolutis et transactis curriculis, &c. Item, quod
non vendat nec alienet maneria, terras, tenementa cum pertinentiis, nec
commutat jocalia nec evidenciales literas, nec pecunias per vestrum
germanum, W. P., et per ipsum receptas London, Bermondyseye, &c., cum
jam sciat de multis ubi sunt, &c. Videtur mihi, salvo saltem vestro
meliori judicio, quod de aliis personis et locis est cum omni celeritate
possibili prudenter providendum et politice, ne idem W. W. oculis luscus
et denigrato colore, in facie fuscus, sit cum W. Yelverton judice
confederatus, et per Ducem Exoniae satis tiranizantem supportatus et per
suos complices, &c. Sapienti loquor; nam philosophorum princeps ait
'Cave ab hiis quos natura signavit'; et metrice dicitur:

  'Nam fallax faciens mens, mores ac pariformes
  Concludunt mutuo quod sit quasi fraudis ymago.'

Dixi vobis quod non esset pro vobis nec vestris utile in W. W. aliquam
confidentiam gerere. Post vestrum didici recessum in 4^or nostri
collegii famulis duplicibus et falsis cum omni perfidia contra
voluntatem militis et ejus executores iniquitatis vinculo confederatis
et astrictis, scilicet Colino Gallico, coquinae clerico, W. W., militis
secretario et W. Eton; nunc in promptuario propter Jhesum Christum
deleantur de libro vertuose et unanimiter viventium et a modo cum justis
nequaquam conscribantur, &c. Est vulgare proverbium 'Accordyng to ryte
reson that to oftyn it is in ceson, that in trust is gret treson.' Ideo
cavete quod Sapiens dicit 'Qui cito credit, levis est corde.'[230.1] Et
audite scripturae sacrae sententiam 'A malo inquit consiliario serva
animam tuam,'[230.2] &c. Nam alibi Sapientis proclamat eloquium: 'Non
est sapientia, non est prudentia, non est consilium contra
Dominum.'[230.3] Haec ibi. In alienis negociis velox, nec vivax erit, qui
in propriis causis piger existit. Rogo attendite et menti imprimite
diligenter quod revolvite quomodo poteritis resistere homini tam
perverso noxam volenti et nocumentum executoribus inferre. Mens mea
particulam evangelii retinet: 'Si in viridi ligno hoc faciunt in arido
quid fiet?'[230.4] Quasi diceret, si iste W. W. executorum ultimus et
merito novissimus et per vestram et magistri Thomae Howes diligenciam
inscriptus tantam proterviam gerit, in hoc quasi exordio, quid in fine
maliciose sit facturus? Hoc penitus ignoro. Deo vos vestros et vestra
commendo et praesentem causam. Recommendetis me si placeat
recommendandis, &c. Scriptum festinanter, hora prima post prandium.
W. B., lator praesentis, intendit vobis si placeat humilime et verissime
servitorum. Ex Castre in die Sabbathi.

Vester ad vota promptissimus,

  FRATER J. B., Minorum minimus.

_Venerando suo magistro, Johanni Paston._

_Jesus, &c._

[Sidenote: 1460]

Reverende domine, &c. Propter Deum caveatis a confidentia in illo nigro
Hibernico[231.2] oculis obliquo et lusco, qui utinam corde, ore et opere
non esset obliquior; qui heri misit literam Colino Gallico; de quibus
dicitur quod singuli caccant uno ano. Et parvus Adam hodie portavit (?)
magistro suo responsum. Idem enim luscus dicit vos esse cupidissimum,
quia multum afflixistis debitores patris vestri, persequendo eos cum
omni rigore, &c. Item dicit quod cum pater vester fuerit judex
ditissimus, quasi nihil fecistis pro eo in distribuendo elemosinam pro
anima ejus, et cum nihil feceritis pro patre vestro, quomodo pro
magistro Fastolf aliquid facietis? Item dicit 'Utinam fuissem in morte
magistri mei, quia in me ultra omnes homines mundi maxime confisus est,'
&c. Item dicit quod in hora qua obiit magister suus, obviavit sibi unus
albus bubo, qui eodem tempore juxta unam ecclesiam continuo clamavit
mirabiliter et volavit saepius iteratis vicibus sub equo suo inter tibias
equi sui &c. Item dixit cuidam fratri conventus mei, 'Magister Brakle
accipit super se magnum regimen, &c., et certe, si pecunia legata in
ultima voluntate suis servientibus non fuerit in larga habundancia
distributa, erit ad magnum dedecus et verecundiam personae meae,' &c.
Utinam caveritis ita bene de eo sicut ego cavebo, quia cum sit filius
Hibernicus, ego de eo semper minus curabo. Ipse vellet habere bona ex
parte sua, &c. Deo teste non fecit (?)[232.1] vos magistri sui, &c. Haec
omnia et plura dixit idem miser magistro Clementi, a quo haec omnia et
plura didici &c. Item dicit quod vos timetis adire locum parliament quia
non vultis praestare pecunias Regi nec Reginae et aliis; et ideo pigritia
vestra in hoc passu erit bonis mortui satis nociva, &c. Ego tot et tanta
audivi de illo quod, per Deum, nunquam confidam in illo, &c.; est enim
miser multum malencolicus et in toto colericus, et, salva patientia
vestra, reddat compotum de singulis antequam capiat onus testamenti, &c.

Judex[232.2] cras venturus est, &c., et sicut se hic gerit vestra
caritas notitiam habebit, &c. Rogo detis mihi licentiam recedendi ad
conventum Norwici, ad mutandum vestimenta mea propter sudores, &c., et
ad studendum pro sermone, &c., ad honorem Dei, &c., qui vos vestros et
vestra salvet in saecula. Amen.

_On the back:_--Item dixit magistro Clementi quod ipse non vult esse
Frere, veni mecum, nec canta secum, nec Dacok, nec facok, nec Frater,
lava pedes, &c. Item dicit vos instruxisse magistrum suum contra eum de
auferendo evidencias, &c., et ipse plures labores habuit pro eo quam vos
vel aliquis alius, &c. Custodite literam ultimo a me vobis missam, &c.

Rygth worchipfull and my most speciall synguler good maister, I recomend

Feythesmesse[235.3] to have ben at London, and for asmoche as
Suthwell[235.4] desyred me to tarye for evydens gevyng, &c. I promysed
hym so to do and tarye tyll the Munday after Seynt Feythesmesse, or tyll
the Tewysday sevenyth after at the ferthest, and at tho dayes I hard no

A[fter] my most speciall recomendacion, like your maisterchip wete that
the office[236.6] is taken at Ocle in lyke forme as Suthwell[236.7] can
schew you, for Fraunceys Costard hath sent it hym, and the jentylmen
that passed uppon the office wold fynd nor medyll nouther with the
tenurs nor ho is next here [_heir_]. Wherfor if ye wol have other wyse
found, Fraunceys Costard hath under take it, but it schal not be by
suche men of worchip [as] is yn this. Item, the under-chryf was at Ocle,
and ded and sayd to the jentylmen al that ever he cowde to the lette of
the matter. And as for Suffolk, I understand they have no warant, so I
tarye as yet what cas that ever falle. And if ye wold that I tarye not,
that it lyke you by the brynger her of to send me hasty wurd.

I send you the names of the jure here in.

that ye wrot of, and to yow also, in ony thynge that he kowde or myte do
in case wer that he wer set in offyse, so that he myth owte do; and ther
to he seyd he wolde be bownde in a m^l. _li._ [L1000] and he was so
myche worthe.

As for the todyr that ye desyiryd I scholde meve to of the same mater,
me semyth he is to yonge to take ony swhyche thyngys up on hym; and also
I knowe veryly that he scholl never love feythfully the todyr man that
ye desyiryd that he schuld do, for when he rem[em]bryth the tyme that is
paste, and ther for I spak not to hym ther of.

Thys day was holde a gret day at Okyll[238.2] befor the undyr schreve
and the undyr exchetor, for the mater of Syr Jon Fastolfys londys; and
ther was my cosyn Rookwod and my cosyn Jon Berney of Redham, and dyvers
odyr jentylmen and thryfty men of the contre; and the mater is well sped
aftyr your intent (blyssyd be God!) as ye schall have knowlage of in
hast.

I suppose Playter schall be with yow on Sonday or on Monday next comyng,
if he may. Ye have many good prayers of the poer pepyl that God schuld
sped yow at thys Parlement, for they leve in hope that ye schold helpe
to set a wey that they myte leve in better pese in thys contre thane
they have do befor, and that wollys schold be purveyd for, that they
schuld not go owt of thys lond as it hathe be suffryd to do be for, and
thane schall the poer pepyll more leve bettyr thane they have do by her
ocwpacion ther in.

Thomas Bone hathe salde all yowyr wole her for xx_d._ a stone, and goode
swerte fownd to yow ther for, to be payid a Myhellmas next comyng; and
it is solde ryth well aftyr that the wole was, for the moste part was
ryte febyll. Item, ther be bowt for yow iij. horse at Seynt Feythys
feyer, and all be trotterys, ryth fayir horse, God save hem, and they be
well kepyd. Item, your myllys at Heylysdon be late [_let_] for xij.
marke, and the myller to fynde the reparacion; and Rychard Calle hathe
let all yowyr londys at Caster; but as for Mawtby londys, they be not
let yet. Wylliam Whyte hathe payid me a geyne thys daye hys x._li._, and
I have mad hym a qwetans ther of, be cause I had not hys oblygacion.

Ther is gret talkyng in thys contre of the desyir of my Lorde of
York.[239.1] The pepyll reporte full worchepfully of my Lord of Warwyk.
They have no fer her but that he and othyr scholde schewe to gret favor
to hem that have be rewyllers of thys contre be for tyme.

I have done all yowyr erandys to Syr Thomas Howes that ye wrote to me
for. I ame rythe glade that ye have sped welle in yowyr materys be twyx
Syr Fylyp Wentworthe and yow, and so I pray God ye may do in all othyr
materys to hys plesans. As for the wrytyngys that ye desyirid that
Playter schulde sende yow, Rychard Call told me that they wer at Herry
Barborys, at the Tempyll gate.

The mayir[239.2] and the mayires sent hedyr her dynerys thys day, and
Jon Dame came with hem, and they dynyd her. I am beholde to hem, for
they have sent to me dyvers tymys sythe ye yed hense. The meyr seyth
that ther is no jentylman in Northefolk that he woll do more for than he
wole for yow, if it laye in hys poer to do for yow. J. Perse is stylle
in prisone, but he wolle not confese more thane he ded when ye wer at
home. Edmond Brome was with me, and tolde me that Perse sent for hym for
to come spek with hym, and he tolde me that he was with hym and examynyd
hym, but he wold not be a knowe to hym that he hade no knowlage wher no
goode was of hys masterys more thane he hade knowlageyd to yow. He tolde
me that he sent for hym to desyir hym to labor to yow and to me for hym
if ye had be at home; and he tolde me that he seyd to hym ayen that he
wold never labor for hym but [_unless_] he myth know that he wer trwe to
hys mastyr, thow it lay in hys power to do ryth myche for hym. I suppose
it schulde do none harme thow the seyd Perse wer remevyd ferther. I pray
to Gode yeve grace that the trowthe may be knowe, and that the dede may
have part of hys owne goode. And the blissyd Trinyte have yow in Hys
kepyng.

Worschipful and most interely bitrustid mayster and specyal frend, after
dute of al lowly recomendacyon, ze schal conceyve that I certefye zow
for trewthe. I comonyd late with a worschipful and a wele namyd, a good
thrifty man of this cuntre, whiche told me in secrete wyse that he herd
Doctor Aleyn seyn after the Parlement of Covintre[242.3] that yf the
Lords that tyme reynyng and now discessid myte haf standyn in governans,
that Fortesku the justise, Doctor Moreton, Jon Heydon, Thorp and he,
schuld be made for evir; and yf it turnyd to contrary wyse, it schuld
growe to her fynal confusyon and uttyr destruccyon; for why, the
parlyows [_perilous_] writing and the myschevous inditing was ymaginid,
contrivid, and utterly concludid by her most vengeable labour, &c., and
her most malicyows conspiracye ayens the innocent lords, knytis,
gentilis, and comonys, and alle her issu perpetuel, &c. And as I wrote
last to zour maysterschip the text of Jeremias c(o) 8(o) _Vere mendacium
operatus est stilus mendax scribarum_; it folwith in the same place,
_Confusi sunt sapientes, perterriti et capti sunt; verbum Domini
projecerunt, et sapientia nulla est in eis. Propterea dabo mulieres
eorum exteris; agros eorum haeredibus alienis, &c._ I wolde myn Lord
Chaunceler and my specyal Lord Erl, utinam Duke, of Warwyk, with al her
trewe affinyte, schuld remembre this text, which is Holy Scripture, &c.,
as I wold do by for the Kyng and hise Lords at the Cros;[243.1] for the
principil of this text hath be contynued in dayly experiens sithe bifore
the Parlement of Bury;[243.2] but the conclusyon of this text came never
zet to experiens, and that is gret rewthe. Consideret discretio vestra
singulorum annorum curricula, et percipietis tunc perplurima exempla de
dominorum fidelium atque communium morte satis injuriosa multiformiter
lamentanda discurrendo per singula. Ex paucis scit discretio vestra
perpendere plura, &c. Et ubi ego semel in ecclesia Pauli palam praedicavi
hunc textum, _Non credas inimico tuo in aeternum_ (Ecc. 12(o)), et quidam
hujus regni doctor et episcopus, utinam non indignus, asseruit eundem
textum Scripturae Sacrae non incorporatum, quid doctor Nicholaus de Lira
super eundem textum dicit, contra audietis, _Non credas, &c._, id est,
Nunquam credas ei quem probasti inimicum, &c. Sequitur in textu:--_Sicut
aeramentum aeruginat malicia illius_, id est, rubiginem odii servat
interius, licet contrarium ostendatur exterius. Ideo in textu
sequitur:--_Etsi humiliatus vadat corvus_ [_curvus_], tibi magnam
reverenciam exhibendo, _affirma, abice_ [_abjice_] _animum tuum ab illo,
nullo modo credendo ei, et custodi te ab illo. Non statuas illum penes
te_ (id est, ipsum tibi familiarem exhibendo); _ne conversus stet in
loco suo_ [should be _tuo_] te supplantando; _et in novissimo agnoscas
verba mea esse vera_, sed nimis tarde. Sequitur: _Quis miserebitur
incantatori a serpente percusso_, &c.; et qui comitatur cum viro iniquo
et obvolutus est in peccatis ejus? _Una hora tecum permanebit; si autem
declinaveris non supportabit. In labiis suis indulcat inimicus, et in
corde suo insidiatur, ut subvertat te in foveam. In oculis suis
lacrimatur inimicus, et si invenerit tempus non saciabitur sanguine. Si
incurrerint tibi mala [invenies] eum illic priorem_, &c. In finem rogo,
videte textum et postillatores super eodem, ex quibus potestis plane
considerare episcopum modernum aliquando Scripturam Sacram ignorare, &c.
Utinam dominorum fidelium provida discrecio amicorum dileccionem
sapienter sic pensaret quod inimicorum dileccionem nequaquam sic amaret,
ut inimicis mortalibus confidenciam exhiberet; quare ut prius sic
replico Jesu Sirach sanum et salubre consilium, _Non credas inimico tuo
in aeternum_. Sapienti, non insipienti scribo. Plura habeo vestrae
reverentiae scribere quae jam non expedit calamo commendare. Uxor Johannis
Berney de Redham jam infra triduum peperit filium, &c. Magistra mea uxor
vestra sana est cum filiis vestris et filiabus ac tota familia.
Conventus noster inter caeteros habet statum vestrum specialissime
recommendatum in missis ac orationibus, consuetisque suffragiis; et cum
jam sitis in parliamento praesenti pro milite electo, uti vobis consulo
verbis Pauli Apostoli, _Labora sicut bonus miles Jesu Christi_;[244.1]
et alibi, Job utendo verbis, _Militia super terram est vita hominis_
(Job 7). _Viriliter igitur agite et confortetur cor vestrum quia
speratis in Domino_ (in Psalmo).[244.2] _Quis_, inquit Sapiens,

    probably written in the year 1460. It is evident some time had
    elapsed since Sir John Fastolf's death, but as the subject was
    one which the writer wished to bring early before Paston's
    notice, it is not likely that he allowed much more than a
    twelvemonth to pass by.]

    date, except that it was written on a Friday (_feria sexta_). It
    might, perhaps, be a little hazardous to date it Friday the 2nd
    January 1461, just after news of the defeat and death of the
    Duke of York reached Norfolk; but this date agrees well with the
    warning to John Paston to ride to London with all haste for his
    safety, which can hardly mean anything else than that the
    Lancastrian party, with their Norfolk supporters (several of
    whom, indeed, are expressly named here), were now sure to bear

THE PRIOR OF BROMHOLM TO JOHN PASTON[250.1]

_Amicabili magistro nostro, Johanni Paston, armigero._

[Sidenote: 1461 / JAN. 31]

Ful reverend and worshipful, after all dewe reverence and
recommendacion, your pore Preste besecheth humble it plese your good
maystirship to understande be this simple bylle that on the Friday next
after the Feste of the Conversion of Seynt Poule laste paste I was at
your place at Castre to a tolde yow what answer I hadde of Sir Thomas
Howis, parson of Blofeld; and in as moche as ye wer not at hoom, I tolde
it to my mastras your wyfe; and God thanke her of her jentilnes, she
made me grete cher, and mor over a vysed me to sende yow a bille ther of
to Lundon. This was his answer, whan I had talked to hym as I cowde in
lyke wyse as ye averted me to do. He answered a geyn in these wordes,
'Nere is my kyrtyl, but nerre [_nearer_] is my smok.' And this was his
menyng that ye schulde be mor ner us and tender to us than he, and that
ye schulde rather owe us good wyl than he, and that we schulde labour
rather to yowr maystirship than to hym; and also that good that he had
to dispose he had be sette it, and of passel he tolde me he had
delyvered the Abbot of Langele fourescor li., wher of, as he seyd to me,
ye grutched and wer in maner displesed, not withstandyng ye seyd a geyn
to hym ye shulde geve as moche. And he seyd to me ye named the places
wher; and therfor he avysed me to labour effectualy to your good
maystirship, for ye mych [_might_] helpe us[251.1] wele. For he seyd ye
had moche good of the dede to dispose, what of your fader, God blisse
that sowle, what of Berney, and what now of his good Mayster Fastolfe.
And as for Sir John Fastolfe, on hoose soule Jesu have mercy! he seyd to
me ye had of his good four, four, and four mor than he in these same
termes with owte ony summe.

And after all oder talkyngs he tolde me he shulde be with yow at Lundon
hastyly, and that he wolde sey good worde to yow to releve our poor
place. Sir, I beseche bethe not displesed, for truly and I woste to have
your hevy maystership therfor, I had lever it had bene on thoght. And is
this that whan Sir Thomas Howes and ye be saunne at Lundon, we myght be
so in your good grace, that our place myght be broder to Langele, for
that shulde glade us mor than the commission that the Bysshop of Norwich
sente us on Thrusday laste paste to gader the dymes, for that is a
shrewde labour for us, a grete coste and a shrewe juparde.

Over mor that hy and myghty celestial Prince preserve yow body and
sowle, and sende yow coumforte of the Holy Goost wele to performe all
your hertis desir in all your materes to his plesaunce, and your
wurship, and solace to alle your welle wyllers.

Wretyn at Bromholm, on the Saturday next after the Feste of the
Conversion of Seynt Poule laste paste.

  From your Preste and Bedeman,

  JOHN, PRIOUR OF BROMHOLM.

    [Footnote 250.1: [From Fenn, iii. 404.] As executor to Sir John
    Fastolf, Paston must have taken possession of Caister soon after
    his death. The Duke of Norfolk, however, pretended a title to
    it, and, as we shall find hereafter, had dispossessed Paston by
    June 1461. This letter, dated on Saturday after the Feast of the
    Conversion of St. Paul, must therefore have been written in
    January 1461, as in 1460--the only other probable year--that
    feast (25th January) fell on Friday, and a letter written on
    Saturday after the feast would not have referred to the Friday
    after the same feast as a past date.]

[Sidenote: 1461 / MARCH 1]

Please it you to wytte that it is lete me witte by on that owith you
good wyll that there is leid awayte up on you in this cuntre, yf ye come
here at large, to bryng you to the presence of syyche a Lord in the
north as shall not be for your ease, but to jopardie of your lyf, or
gret and importable losse of your goods. And he that hath take up on hym
this enterprise now was undr-shireff to G. Sayntlowe. He hath gret
favour herto by the meanes of the sone of William Baxter that lyth
beryed in the Grey Freres; and, as it is reported, the seid sone hath
geve gret sylver to the Lords in the north to bryng the matier a bowte,
and now he and alle his olde felaweship put owt their fynnes, and arn
ryght flygge and mery, hopyng alle thyng is and shalbe as they wole have
it. Also it is tolde me that the fadr of the bastard in this cuntre seid
that now shuld this shire be made sewir for hym and his heires hens
forward, and for the Baxsteris heyres also, wherby I conceyve they
thynke that they have none enemy but you, &c.

Wherfor like it you to be the more war of your gydyng for your persones
saufgard, and also that ye be not to hasty to come in to this cuntre til
ye here the world more sewer. I trowe the berar of this shall telle more
by mowthe, as he shall be enfourmed of the rewell in this cuntre. God
have yow in His kepyng.

Wretyn in hast, the secund Sunday of Lent by candel light at evyn.

  By yours, &c.

    [Footnote 252.1: [From Fenn, iii. 412.] 'This letter,' says
    Fenn, 'has no direction, and lest it should be opened, the paper
    which fastens the seal is, along the edge, marked with lines by
    a pen, which communicate with the latter (_qu._ with the
    _letter_?), by which means the receiver might easily have
    discovered any attempts to have opened it, as the lines would
    not then have exactly coincided again. On the back of it, but in
    a later hand, is written, "A lettre to J. Paston, ar., from his
    wife."'

    Fenn considers, I think with great probability, that this letter
    was written 'just before the important crisis that finished
    Henry's reign, and placed Edward on the throne,' when Margaret
    of Anjou was expected in London after winning the second battle
    of St. Albans. Giles Saint Loe was sheriff of Norfolk and
    Suffolk in 1458.]

    [Footnote 253.1: [From Fenn, iv. 78.] This letter was written
    some time after the death of Sir John Fastolf--not unlikely, as
    Fenn imagines, in the reign of Edward IV.; but the exact date is
    immaterial.]

    [Footnote 254.1: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] Beyond the evident
    fact that this letter was written between the death of Sir John
    Fastolf in 1459 and that of John Paston in 1466, there is not
    much clue to the date.]

A WHITSUNDAY SERMON OF FRIAR BRACKLEY[256.1]

Frends, this holy tyme, as owr moder Holy Chirch maketh mension, the
Holy Gost came from hevyn, and lighted in the disciples of Crist,
inflamyng them with connyng, and strenghyng them with grace. And be
cause the doctrine and prechyng of them shuld go thurghought all the
werd, furst thei wer to be enfourmed and taught connyng, and to be
strenth with awdacide and grace, and than to be endewed and yovyn all
manner of langags that thei myght prechyn to all maner of naciones, so
that tho naciones that thei preched to myght understond them, and every
naciones his owyn tonge; and so thees Appostilles, after that thei wern
enspired with the Holy Gost, wher so ever thei preached, were ther never
so many naciones present, ich nacion thought that thei spokyn in ther
owyn langage--etenim illud loquebantur variis linguis Apostoli.

Frends, iij. thyngs be necessary in prechyng to hym that shall prechyn
thurgh the werd as the Appostell dede--that is to sey, connyng,
boldnesse, and langags. If thei had had connyng and none audacite, but
have fered to have preched, it shuld litill a profited, as we have
examplles dayly at Cambrige, exempli [gratia][256.2] de Clerico quis
studuit sermonem, &c. And if thei have bothyn connyng and audacite, and
have none eloquensye ner copiousnesse of langage, so that he preche that
his audiens is most excercised in, that thei may understand hym, elles
it profiteth not.

Therfor thes holy Appostill[es], be for thei shuld prechyn, furst thei
wer to be confirmed and strenghed. Our Lord strenghed them be under
nemyng,[257.1] enformyng, and helpyng, culpando ut in Evangelium
recumbentibus, &c. He strenghed them with his help and grace whan he
brethed in them, seyng 'Accipite Spiritum Sanctum; et quorum remiseritis
peccata, remittuntur eis, et quorum retinueritis retenta sunt,'[257.2]
&c. He strenghed them also be his doctrine whan he seid 'Petite et
accipietis; si quid petieritis Patrem in nomine meo, dabit
vobis.'[257.3] How that ye shuld prayn to God and askyn, I taught you on
Estern day. Therfor ye shall pray to God be good werkyng, right full
lebyring, and in good deds perseveryng.

Frends, ye owe for to ask of God that your joy may ben a full joy and
perfight; we may never have a full joy in this werd, wher as ever among
folwyth hevynesse. A man joyth sumtyme in gold and sylver, and in gret
substaunce of erdly gods, in bewte of women, but this joy is not
perfyght--but this joy is not stabill, but it is mutabill as a shadow;
for he that this joyth in the bewte of his wyffe, it may fortune to
morwyn he shall folwyn her to chirch up on a bere. But if ye wull knowyn
what is a full and a wery joy, truly forgevenesse of synne and
everlestyng blisse, wher as is never sikenesse, hunger, ner thurst, ner
no maner of disseas, but all welth, joy, and prosperite, &c. Ther be
iij. maner of joys, the on void, a nother half full, the thred is a full
joy. The furst is plente of werdly gods, the seconde is Gostly grace,
the threde is everlestyng blisse. The furst joy, that is affluens of
temporall gods, is called a veyn joy, for if a man wer set at a bord
with delicate mets and drynks, and he sey a cawdron boyllyng a forn hym
with pykke and bronston, in the which he shuld be throwyn naked as sone
as he had dyned; for he shuld joy mych in his deliciose mets, it shuld
be but a veyn joy.

Right so doth the joy of a covetouse man, if he sey what peyn his sowle
shuld suffre in helle for the myskepyn and getyn of his good, he shuld
not joy in his tresore, ut in Libro Decalogorum, 'Quidam homo dives,'
&c.

Semiplenum gaudium est quando quis in praesenti gaudet et tunc cogitans
de futuris dolet, ut in quodam libro Graeco, 'Quidam Rex Graeciae,' &c. Her
ye may se but half a joy; how [_who_] shuld joy in this werd, if he
remembred hym of the peynes of the toder werd? 'Non glorietur fortis in
fortitudine sua, nec sapiens in sapientia sua, nec dives in divitiis
suis.'[258.1] De quibus dicitur, qui confidunt in multitudine divitiarum
suarum, quasi oves in inferno positi sunt.[258.2] 'Qui gloriatur, in
Domino glorietur.'[258.3] Therfor lete us joy in hope of everlestyng joy
and blis. 'Gaudete quia nomina vestra scripta sunt in caelo,'[258.4] ut
gaudium vestrum sit plenum. A full joy is in hevyn. Et in hoc apparet
quod magnum gaudium est in caelo, quoniam ibi est gaudium quod 'oculus
non vidit, nec auris audivit, et in cor hominis non ascendit, quae Deus
praeparavit diligentibus,'[258.5] et ideo, fratres, variis linguis
loquens [precor] ut gaudium vestrum sit plenum, vel habeatis gaudium
sempiternum.

[JOHN PASTON?] TO [RICHARD] SOUTHWELL[260.1]

Brother Suthwell, I comand me to yow, sertifiing yow that, on Thursday
be the morwe, I spak with my cosine Wichingham at London, where he lete
me wet of the letter sent to Lee, wherby I conseyve the stedfast
godlordship and ladiship of my Lord and my Lady[260.2] in this mater,
&c., whech gevith cause to all her servaunts to trost verily in them and
to do hem trew servise. I lete yow wete that the seid Wychyngham, when I
departid from hym, had knowleche that Jane Boys shuld that nyght be come
to London, and he put in a bylle to the Lordis for to have delyverauns
of hyr and to have hese adversarys arestid. And this nyght at Norwiche
was told me newe tydyngges that she shuld on Thursday after my departyng
a be before the Lordis and there asaide untrewly of her selff, as the
berer hereof shal informe yow if ye know it not before; of wheche
tydyngges, if they be trew, I am sory for her sake, and also I fere that
her frendys schuld sewe the more feyntely, wheche Godde defende. For her
seyng untrewly of her selff may hurt the mater in no man but her selff;
and thow she wol mescheve her selff, it wer gret pete but if the mater
were laborid forth, not for her sake, but for the worchepe of the
estatys and other that have laboryd therin, and in ponyshing of the gret
oryble dede. Wherfore I send yow dyvers articlis in a bill closid herin,
wheche preve that she was raveshid ayens hyr wel, what so ever she sey.

   *   *   *

Thes be provis that Jane Boys was ravischig [_sic_] ageyn her wil, and
not ber awn assent.

One is that she, the tyme of her takyng, whan she was set upon her hors,
she revyled Lancasterother[261.1] and callid hym knave and wept, and
kryid owte upon hym pitewly to her, and seid as shrewdly to hym as coud
come to her mende, and fel doune of her hors unto that she was bound,
and callid him fals t[r]aytor that browth her the rabbettes.

Item, whan she was bounde she callid upon her modyer, wheche folwyd her
as far as she myght on her feet, and whan the seid Jane sey she myght
goo no ferther, she kryid to her modyer and seid that what so ever fel
of her, she shuld never be weddyd to that knave, to deye for it.

Item, be the weye, at Shraggarys hous in Kokely Cley, and at
Brychehamwell, and in all other places wher she myght see any people,
she kryid owte upon hym, and lete people wete whos dowtyr she was, and
how she was raveshid ayens her wyll, desyeryng the people to folwe her
and reskew her.

Item, Lancasterotherys prest of the Egle in Lyncolne shire, wheche
shroff her, seid that she told hym in confession that she wold never be
weddyd to hym, to deye for it; and the same prest seid he wold not wedde
hem togedyr for M{^l.}_li._

Item, she sent divers tokenes of massage to Sothwell be Robert Inglose,
wheche previth welle at that tyme she lovyd not Lancasterother.

Item, a man of the master of Carbrokes come dyvers tymes in the weke
before she was raveshid to Wychynghams hous, and inquerid of her mayde
whedyr her mastras was insuerid to Sothwell or nay, the wheche prevyth
well that Lancasterother was not sure of her godwill ne knew not of her
counseyl, for if he had, he ne nedid not to have sent no spyes.

Whech seen, I avyse yow to move my Lord and my Lady to do in this mater
as affettualy as they have do before, for this mater touchyth hem,
consideryng that they have begonne; and dowt not, what so ever falle of
the woman, well or evel, my Lord and my Lady shal have worchep of the
mater if it be wel laborid, and also ye shall have avayl therof and the
advers parte chall gret trobil.

Also it were necessarie that Wychyngham were sent to and cofortyd in
hese seute, and that he avysid hym of seche articlis and preves of the
mater as I have sent to yow and put hem in writing, but not to disclose
non tho preves to non creature unto that tyme that it fortune the mater
to be tried be enquest, or other wyse take end, but avyse hym for to
seye to the Lords and all      (?) in generall termes that what so ever
Lancasterother or hese douter seyn nowh, it shal be wel prevyd she was
reveshid ayens her wyll; and let him desire of the Lordis that his
dowter mith be in his kepyng, and at large fro Lancasterother un tylle
the mater were duly examynd. I wold this mater sped the bety[r] be cause
my Lady spoke so feythefully to me therin, and that mevyth me to wryte
to yow this long symple lettyr of myn intent. [262.1][Also wher ye be
informyd that vj. men of Osbern Monforthes shuld a be at the seid
raveshing, I certifie yow verily it was not soo; for Osbern Mondeford
wol do in the mater all that ever he can or may to help to punisse the
doer, and desirith to know the grownd of that tale, of whech I pray send
me word if and what ye will ellis.] God kepe yow.

    [Footnote 260.1: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] This letter is printed
    from a corrected draft in a hand which may be that of Margaret
    Paston, writing in her husband's name. The beginning may perhaps
    refer to the impending marriage of Richard Southwell with Amy,
    daughter of Sir Edmund Wichingham, which took place, according
    to Blomefield (x. 274), about the beginning of Edward IV.'s
    reign. From the mention made of Osbert Mundford, however, the
    letter cannot be later than 1460. The ravishment of Jane Boys,
    as here related, corresponds so closely with that of Dame Joan
    Beaumont, of which notice will be found in the _Rolls of Parl._,
    v. 269, that we might almost surmise the same person is spoken
    of; but this can hardly be.]

JOHN PASTON THE YOUNGEST TO ----[265.1]

[Sidenote: 1461]

I recomand me to yow, and lete yow wete that notwythstandyng tydinggs
come down, as ye know, that pepill shuld not come up tyll thei were sent
fore, but to be redy at all tymes; this notwithstandyng, most pepill owt
of this cuntre have take wages, seying thei woll goo up to London; but
thei have no capteyn, ner rewler assigned be the commissioners to awayte
upon, and so thei stragyll abowte be them self, and be lyklynes are not
like to come at London half of them. And men that come from London sey,
there have not passid Thetford, not passyng CCCC.; and yet the townes
and the cuntere that have waged hem shall thynk thei be discharged, and
therfore if this Lords above wayte aftyr more pepill in this cuntre, be
lyklynes it woll not be easy to get with owt a newe comission and
warnyng. And yet it woll be thought ryght straunge of hem that have
waged pepill to wage any more, for every towne hath waged and sent
firth, and are redy to send forth, as many as thei ded whan the Kyng
sent for hem be fore the feld at Lodlowe;[266.1] and thei that ar not
go, be goyng in the same forme.

Item, ther was shrewd rewle toward in this cuntre, for ther was a
certeyn person forth wyth after the jurney at Wakefeld, gadered felaship
to have mo[r]dered John Damme, as is seyd; and also ther is at the
Castell of Rysing, and in other ij. plases, made gret gaderyng of
pepill, and hyryng of harneys, and it is wele undyrstand they be not to
the Kyng ward, but rather the contrary, and for to robbe. Wherfore my
fadyr is in a dowte, whedir he shall send my brother up or not, for he
wold have his owne men abowte hym, if nede were here; but
notwythstandyng, he wyll send up Dawbeney, his spere and bowes with hym,
as Stapilton and Calthrop or other men of worship of this cuntre agree
to doo. Wherfore demene yow in doyng of yowr erandes ther aftyr, and if
ye shall bryng any masage from the Lords, take writyng, for Darcorts
massage is not verely beleved be cause he browt no wrytyng.

Item, this cuntre wold fayne take these fals shrewes that are of an
oppynion contrary to the Kyng and his Counsell, if they had no auctorite
from the Kyng to do so.

Item, my brother is redy[n] to Yarmowth for to lette brybers that wold a
robbed a ship undyr color of my Lord of Warwyk, and longe nothyng to hem
ward.

    letter is in the original 'without either date, name, or

    'one of John Paston's sons.' Nevertheless, in a very misleading
    way, the signature 'John Paston' is inserted at the foot of the
    right-hand copy, with a reference to a facsimile of the
    signature of John Paston the youngest. There is every

    [Footnote 271.3: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] This letter was
    evidently written in the beginning of Edward IV.'s reign; and as
    it appears by No. 458 that Paston had already been dispossessed
    of Caister, not indeed by the Duke of Suffolk, but by the Duke
    of Norfolk, as early as the 5th June 1461, we may presume that
    this letter, dated in May, belongs to that year. The margin of
    the letter is slightly mutilated, but the words which are lost
    are obvious, and have been supplied in brackets.]

THOMAS DENYES TO JOHN PASTON[272.1]

_To my maister Paston._

[Sidenote: 1461]

I lowly recomaund me to your maistership, thankyng you as a pouer man
may do his maister for soccuryng my wyf, which I wete wele is wo begone;
praying you for love of our Lord Jhesu Criste to take no displesir
though I not sent ne wrote to you herbeforn in this troble that I haf.
For parde ye may conceyve that I was besy j nogh to shifft my self til
now. Truly the noise cam sodeynly and I was withynne the walles of your
Cite, God sauf the governour therof, for he was besy to trappe me, more
besy than he wole be a know, _et per fenestram in sporta dimissus sum
per murum, et sic effugi manus ejus_; but he shal abye, by God, if I
lyf, for serchyng myn house. And, Sir, as for the fals noise, sauf your
reverence, that he leyth on me and on tweyn servauntz of myn, he lyeth
falsly, your reverence savid; for I may haf an C. persones notable and
thrifty, whan tyme comyth, that wole prove and make good by every meane,
that my servauntz, which he nameth, wer that same our at Brisle which is
thens more than xvj. myle, and that the same our and the same day and a
greet space bothe beforn and afftir. But ever I besech your maistership
of contynuaunce, and that ye like to do my wif help and comfort in hir
dissese; for if she wer not, God knowith, I shuld soone shyfft. And
truly I haf no thought ne sorwe but for hir. Wherfore I beseche you
lowly for His love that all socourith and susteyneth to be good maister
and comfort to her. It shal not be long to but that I shall send to hir
to labour hir to other place, as for ony thyng touchyng me ellis but
that. I pray you also, if the boy that is hurt dey, to meve your
tenauntz in that hundrid wher he was bete to do for me and myn; ellis
can I not desire ne write at this tyme for lak of remembraunce, for I am
not yet myn own man. Besechyng yow alwey of good maistership, for
Almyghty God knowith that the mater was falsly begunne on me and usurie
it is and acursid, so wold our Lord I never had knowyn it; but sith I
delid therwith I myght never reche it to handle the mater to trouth or
reson. Wherfore I am compellid to do therwith unresonably. But, gentill
Sir, socour my wif, and be not displesid with me, and than shal I do
wele with Goddis mercy, Who Almyghty preserve yow for His mercy. Wretyn
onavised, &c.

I pray you socour my wif, for she is wedow yet for me, and shal be til
more is done, sith I se that neyther plee, trety ne werre may make my
peas; for I leve hir undir your proteccion til I write to hir to go
thens, which shal be hastily, I suppose, praying you to be alwey hir
good maister, for I purpose not to se hir of a while, though she remeve.
Wrete with sorwfull hert, &c.

helpe me now in the grettest extremite that I cam at sith my greet
trobil with Ingham.[274.2] It is not oute of your remembraunce how Twyer
in Norff[olk] vexith me bothe by noise and serchyng myn house for me, so
that theer I can not be in quyete; and all that, I am verily acerteyned,
is by Heydens crafft. And heer in the Kyngs house annenst Howard,[274.3]
wher I had hopid to a' relevid myself, I am supplanted and cast oute
from hym by a clamour of all his servaunts at onys, and ne wer oonly
that his disposicion acordyth not to my pouer conceyte, which maketh me
to gif lesse force, be cause I desire not to dele ther [_where_] bribery
is like to be usid, ellis by my trouth this unhappy unkyndenes wold I
trow a' killed me. I pray yow, at the reverence of Jesu Criste, to
enfourme my Lord of Warwyk of me. Parde I haf do hym service; I was with
hym at Northampton, that all men knew; and now agayn at Seynt Albones,
that knowth James Ratcliff; and ther lost I xx_li._ wurth horse,
herneys, and mony, and was hurte in diverse places. I pray yow to gete
me his good Lordship, and that I may be toward hym in Norffolk in his
Courts holdyng, or ellis, if ony thyng he haf to do; and that ye wole
gete me a letter to Twyer to late me to sit in rest. For now if I made
any felaship agayn Twyer, I can haf no colour now the Shirref and I be
oute, so I must kepe me aparte, which I am lothe to do, be God, if I
myght better do.

I besech yow to send me your intent by the next man that come from yow.
I shuld a' come to zow, but, so help me God, my purs may no ferther. The
Holy Trinite preserve yow.

Wretyn hastily at York, &c.

    [Footnote 274.1: [From Fenn, iv. 10.] The writer of this letter
    speaks of having served with the Earl of Warwick at the battle
    of Northampton in July 1460, and again at the second battle of
    St. Albans in February 1461. We know from later letters that he
    was murdered in the beginning of July following. As he dates
    from York, and speaks of being 'here in the King's house,' the
    date would appear to be about the 10th of May, on which day we
    find by the dates of the Privy Seals that Edward IV. was at
    York.]

    [Footnote 275.1: [Douce MS. 393, f. 85.] The date of this letter
    may, with great probability, be attributed to the year 1461. It
    certainly cannot be later, as the writer was executed for high
    treason in February 1462. He was found to have been
    corresponding with Margaret of Anjou for the restoration of
    Henry VI., but the discovery must have been much later than May
    1461. Sir John Howard, who, for his services to the House of
    York, was afterwards made Duke of Norfolk, appears to have had
    great influence just after the accession of Edward IV., which he
    used in a very overbearing manner; and we have already seen, by
    the last letter, that the Earl of Oxford's servant, Thomas
    Denyes, was at this very time suffering much persecution at his
    hands.]

[Sidenote: 1461]

After my most special recommendacion, please your maisterchip wete, the
Kyng, be cause of the sege a boute Carelylle, chaunged his day of
Coronacion to be upon the Sunday[276.2] nexst after Seynt John Baptyste,
so the'ntent to spede hym northward in all hast; and how be it, blyssed
be God, that he hath now good tydynggs, that Lord Mountagu hath broken
the sege, and slayn of Scotts vj.^ml. [6000] and ij. knyghes, whereof
Lord Cliffords brother is one, yet not wythstandyng he wol be crowned
the sayd Sunday. And John Jeney enformed me, and as I have verely lerned
sethen, ye ar inbylled to be made knygth at this Coronacion.[276.3]
Wheder ye have understandyng before hand, I wot not; but and it lyke you
to take the worchip uppon you, consyderyng the comfortable tytynggs
afore seyd, and for the gladnesse and plesour of al your welwyllers, and
to the pyne and dyscomfort of all your ille wyllers, it were tyme your
gere necessarye on that by halfe were purveyd fore, and also ye had nede
higth you to London, for as I conceyve the knygthes schuld be made uppon
the Saterday by for the Coronacion; and as moche as may be purveyed for
you in secrete wyse wythouten cost I schall by speke for you, if nede
be, ayens your comyng, in trust of the best; neverthelesse, if ye be
dysposed, ye had nede send a man by fore in all hast, that no thing be
to seke. William Calthorp is inbylled, and Yelvertoun is inbylled,
whiche caused Markham; because Yelverton loked to have ben chef juge,
and Markham thynketh to plese hym thus. And as for the mater ayens
Poutrell, we can no farther procede, tyl we have my maister your faders
testament. I sent my maistres a letter for it. No more, but I pray Al
myghty Jesu have you in His kepyng.

RICHARD CALLE TO JOHN PASTON[277.1]

_To my right reverent worschipfull master, my Master John Paston._

[Sidenote: 1461 / JUNE 5]

Right reverent and worschipfull master, I lowly recomande me unto your
good masterschip. Plesith you to witte that I have ben at Framelyngham,
and spake Ric Sothwell to hafe hes advice in this mater; wherin he wolde
geve me but litell councell, and seide ze were straungely disposed, for
ye trusted no man, and had moche langage, weche the berer herof schal
enforme your masterschip.

And as for the letters, they were delivered my Lorde[277.2] at the
Logge, but I cowde not speke with hese Lordeschip. And suche tyme as
they were delyvered Fitz William whas there, weche is now keper of
Castre; and what tyme as my Lorde had sene the lettres, he comaunded hym
to avoide, and so he did. And thanne my Lorde sent for Sothwell. And in
the meene tyme my Lorde sent a man to me, and axed me where ye were, and
I tolde hem ye were with the Kyng; and so he sent me worde that an
answere schulde be made be Sothwel to the King, seyng that ii. or iij.
eyers [_heirs_] had ben with my Lorde, and shewed her [_i.e._ their]
evidence, and delyvered it to my Lorde, seyng they have had gret wrong,
besechyng my Lorde that it myght be reformed. Wherfor he comaunded me
that I shulde go hom, for other answer cowde I non have. So I aboude
uppon Sothwel to a' know my Lordes answer to the Kyng; weche answere
Sothwel tolde me was, that he writeth to the Kyng that certeine points
in your lettres be untrew, and that he schal prove suche tyme as he
cometh befor the Kyng, besechyng the Kyng to take it to no displesur;
for he is advised to kepe it still unto the tyme that he hath spaken
with his Highnesse, for he trusteth to God to schewe suche evidence to
the Kyng and to the Lords, that he schulde have best right and titill
therto; and so he sent a man forthe to the Kyng this day. It were right
wele don ye awayted upon hes man comyng, that ye myght knowe the redy
entent of my Lordes writyng.

Berthelmew Elysse hathe ben with my Lorde, and made a relesse to my
Lord; and Sir Will Chamberleine was ther ij. dayes afore I come thirder,
I can thynke for the sam mater. And Thomas Fastolf whas there the same
tyme that I was ther; and as I am enformed, they have delyvered my Lorde
serteine evidence. Wherfore me semeth it were right wele don, savyng
your better advice, to com hom and sele up your evidence, and have hem
with you to London, to prove his titill noght. Ther be but ii. or iij.
men with in the place, and if ye thynke it best to do it, send word, and
I suppose a remedy schal be had.

Also I here no word of Master William, nor of the writts for the
Parlament. Also it is tolde here that Tudenham[278.1] and Heydon have a
pardon of the Kyng, and that they schal come up to London with the Lady
of Suffolk to the Coronacion. Also as for the letter that ye sent to
Thomas Wyngfeld, I have it still, for he is at London. Some men sey he
meved my Lord for to entre, and some sey Fitz William is in defaute. So
I can see ther is but fewe goode. Also my master Sir Thomas Howys schol
send a letter to the person ye wote of, for to deliver you the gere at
London the next week. My right wourschipfull and reverent master,
Almyghti God preserve you.

    [Footnote 280.4: Childermas, or Holy Innocents' Day, the 28th of
    December, fell on Sunday in the year 1460. The day of the week
    on which it fell used to be considered ominous or unlucky during
    the whole ensuing year. This superstition seems to have
    continued as late as the beginning of the eighteenth century,
    and is alluded to by Addison in the seventh number of the
    _Spectator_. It is not true, however, that Edward's coronation
    was put off till Monday. It took place on the Sunday which had
    been originally appointed for it, but the processions and
    pageantry were deferred till next day. The following is the
    account of the matter given in a contemporary chronicle in the
    Cottonian MS., Vitellius, A. xvi:--

    'And upon the morn, Sunday, which was St. Peter's Even, and the
    28th day of June, he was crowned at Westminster with great
    solemnity of bishops and other temporal lords. And upon the morn
    after, the King went crowned again in Westminster Abbey, in the
    worship of God and St. Peter. And upon the next morn he went
    also crowned in St. Paul's in the worship of God and St. Paul;
    and there the angel came down and censed him. At which time was
    as great a multitude of people in Paul's as ever was seen afore
    in any days.']

[Sidenote: 1461 / JULY]

Right noble and wurshipfull mastresse, I recomaund me to yow with my
pouer servise. And for so moche as I here no thyng of my maister your
husbonds comyng hastly home,--and though he cam or come not, it were
expedient that the Kyng were infourmed of the demenyng of the
shire,--therfore I send to yow a testymonyall, which is made by a greet
assent of greet multitude of comons, to send to the Kyng. I pray you for
the good spede therof that in all hast possible ye like to send it to my
said maister, if he be with the Kyng; ellis fynde the meane to send it
to the Kyng, thogh my maister be thens; beside forthe that ye vouchsauf
to late diligent labour be made to a sufficient nombir to assele for my
Maister Paston allone, for if bothe holde not, I wolde oon helde.

I pray yow that it lyke you to send for my Maister William Paston, and
shew hym all thys, and that it were hastid; for on the adversaire parte
Judas slepith not.

Berney promised to a' sent, but for our Lords love trust not that; for I
se his slouthe and sely labour, which is no labour. And I wold ful fayn
speke with yow, &c.

My maister your husbond wole peraventure blame us all, if this mater be
not applied; for he may not of reson do so largely heryn by his myght,
be cause he is elyted, as the Comons myght wisely do with help of his
favour, if it wer wisely wrought. If my Maister William Paston ride
hastly from a x. daies to London, I wole with hym, if he send me word.
The Holy Trinite preserve yow. Wretyn rudely in hast the Sunday, &c.

    [Footnote 284.1: [From Fenn, iv. 18.] This letter speaks of the
    county of Norfolk as being in an unquiet state, and of John
    Paston as having been elected knight of the shire. It will be
    seen by No. 458 that writs for an election were expected as
    early as the 5th of June in 1461, and as I find that the writer
    of this letter was murdered on the 4th of July following, the
    date is probably about the very beginning of that month. From
    what is said at the beginning of the letter about Paston's
    absence from home, it was evidently some time after the last,
    which was written on the very day of his departure.]

THOMAS PLAYTER TO JOHN PASTON[296.1]

_To maister John Paston Esquyer in hast._

[Sidenote: 1461 / AUG. 1 (?)]

Please your maistership wete that Danyell of Grayes In enfourmed me that
Kyng of Dounham whiche slewe Thomas Denys is arested and in hold at
Wysbyche and had ben delyvered nor had Fraunceys Costard a taken suerte
of pees of hym; and so he is kept in by non other meane but al onely by
suerte of pees. And as I felt by the said Danyell if he be craftyly
handeled he woll accuse many other; but Danyell is loth to name hem, but
I suppose he ment by Twyer and yet other mo, right sufficient, and
kalled of substans. Item, Haydon hath payed ccccc. marks and is
delivered. Item it is talked the parlement schal be proroged tyl the
iiij. day of Novembre and the kyng wol in to Scotland in al hast. Wretyn
in hast uppon the day of the Advencion.[296.2]

  Youris,

  THOMAS PLAITER.

    [Footnote 296.1: [Add. MS. 34,888, f. 181.] The year in which
    this letter was written is certain, not only from the reference
    to the murder of Thomas Denys, which was in July 1461, but also
    from the mention of the prorogation of Parliament to the 4th of
    November.]

JOHN PASTON TO MARGARET PASTON[296.3]

_To my mastres Paston and Richard Calle._

[Sidenote: 1461 / AUG. 1]

First, that Richard Calle fynde the meane that a distresse may be taken
of such bestes as occupie the ground at Stratton, and that cleyme and
contynuauns be made of my possession in any wise, and that thei be not
suffrid to occupie withowt thei compoune with me; and that aftir the
distresse taken the undirshreve be spoke with all that he make no
replevyn with out agrement or apoyntement taken, that the right of the
lond may be undirstand.

ij. Item, I here sey the peple is disposed to be at the shire at Norwich
on Sen Lauerauns Day for th'affermyng of that thei have do afore, wherof
I hold me wele content if thei do it of her owne disposicion, but I woll
not be the cause of the labour of hem, ner bere no cost of hem at this
tyme, for be the lawe I am suer befor, but I am wel a payed it shall be
on han halyday for lettyng of the peples werk. I undirstand ther shall
be labour for a coroner that day, for ther is labour made to me for my
good wyll here, and I wyll nothyng graunt withowt the under shreves
assent, for he and I thought that Richard Bloumvyle were good to that
occupacion. Item, ye shall undirstand that the undirshreve was some what
flekeryng whill he was here, for he informyd the Kyng that the last
eleccion was not peasibill, but the peple was jakkyd and saletted, and
riottously disposid, and put hym in fere of his lyfe. Wherefore I gate
of hym the writte whech I send yow herwith, to that entent, thow any
fals shrewe wold labour, he shuld not be sure of the writ, and therfore
ye most se that the undirshreve have the writ at the day, in case the
peple be gadered, and thanne lete th'endentures be made up or er they
departe.

iij. Item, that ye remembyr Thomas Denys wyfe that her husbond had
divers billes of extorcion don be Heydon and other, whech that he told
me that his seid wyfe beryid whan the rumour was, so that thei were ny
roten. Bidde her loke hem up and take hem yow.

iiij. Item, as for the seyd distreynyng at Stratton, I wold that
Dawbeney and Thomas Bon shuld knowe the closes and the ground, that thei
myght attende ther to, that Richard were not lettyd of other
occupacions, and I wold this were do as sone as is possibill, or I come
home. Notwithstandyng, I trowe I shall come home or the shire, but I
woll nat it be knowe till the same day, for I will not come there with
owt I be sent fore be the peple to Heylisdonne. Notwithstandyng, and the
peple were wele avertised at that day, they shuld be the more redy to
shewe the oribyll extorcions and briberys that hath be do upon hem to
the Kyng at his comyng, desyring hym that he shuld not have in favor the
seyd extorcioners, but compelle hem to make amendes and sethe
[_satisfaction_] to the pore peple.

v. Item, that Berney and Richard Wright geve suche folkys warnyng as
wyll compleyne to be redy with her billes if thei list to have any
remedy.

vj. Item, that the maters ayens Sir Miles Stapilton may at Aylesham be
remembyrd.

vij. Also if ye can be any craft get a copy of the bille that Sir Miles
Stapilton hath of the corte rolles of Gemyngham, that ye fayle not, but
assay and do yowr devyr, for that shuld preve some men shamefully fals.
Master Brakle seyd he shuld a get oon of Freston. I wold he shuld assay,
or ellys peraventure Skypwith, or ellys Master Sloley; for if Stapilton
were boren in hande that he shuld be founde fals and ontrewe, and first
founder of that mater, he wold bothe shewe the bille and where he had
it.[298.1]

viij. Item, I wold the prestis of Caster were content for Midsomer term.

ix. Item, ther is a whith box with evidens of Stratton, in on of the
canvas baggis in the gret cofir, or in the spruse chest. Ric. Calle
knowith it well, and ther is a ded of feffement and a letter of atorne
mad of the seyd londs in Stratton to John Damm, W. Lomner, Ric. Calle,
and John Russe. I wold a new dede and letter of atorne were mad owth
theroff be the feffees of the same laund to Thome Grene,[298.2] Thome
Playter, the parson of Heylisdon, Jacobo Gloys, klerke,[298.3] Johanni
Pamping, and that the ded bere date nowh, and that it be selid at the
next shire; for than I suppose the seyd feffes will be ther if it may
not be don er that tyme. I wold have the seyd dedis leyd in a box, both
old and new, and left secretly at Ric. Thornis hows at Stratton, that
whan I com homwar I mygh fynd it ther, and mak seson [_seisin_] and stat
to be take whil I wer ther. Wret at London on Lammes Day.

    [Footnote 296.3: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] This letter is printed
    from a draft which is partly in John Paston's own hand. The
    contents clearly refer to, first, the Norfolk election of 1461,
    which it was proposed to confirm by a new meeting of the
    electors at the shire-house; and secondly, the necessity of
    electing a new coroner after the murder of Thomas Denys. The
    date is therefore certain.]

JOHN RUSSE TO JOHN PASTON[299.1]

_To my right worshypfull and reverent maistyr, John Paston, at Norwich._

[Sidenote: 1461 / AUG. 23]

Ryght worshypfull sir, and my right honourable maister, I recomaunde me
louly to you. And plese youre maistirshyp to wete that my Maister
Clement, youre brothyr, and Plater, wrot a letter to my mayster yore
sone[299.2] yistirday, the tenure of whych was how ye were entretyd
there. And as ye desyred me, so I enformyd hem the mater along, for they
wist not of it til I told hem; and they wrete the more pleynerly
inasmych as a worshypfull man rood the same day, and bare the letter to
my seyd maister youre sone.

The Lord Bourgcher is with the Kynge, and my Lord Warwyk still in the
North, &c.

Item, sir, thys day cam on John Waynflet from the Kyng streyt weye, and
he is of myn aqueyntaunce; and he teld me there was no voyse nor spekyng
aboute the Kyng of that mater; and I teld hym all the mater along hou ye
were intretyd, whych he wyll put in remembraunce in ony place that he
cometh in in Suffolk or Esex as he goth homward, for he owyth no good
wil to youre adversary. And the seyd Waynflet teld me that he knowyth
for serteyn that the Kyng cometh not to Northefolk til he hathe been
upon the Marchys of Walys, and so there is no serteynte of hyse comyng
thys many dayez. He teld me he lefte the Kyng with a smal felashyp
aboute hym.

And I enqueryd hym of the gyding of my maystyr yore sone, whiche he
comendyd gretly, and seyd that he stood well inconseyt, and dayly shuld
increse; and he was well in acqueyntaunce and be lovyd with jentilmen
aboute the Kyng. But he seyd ther shal no thyng hurte hym but youre
streytnesse of mony to hym, for withoute he have mony in hyse purse, so
as he may resonably spende among hem, ellys they wyll not sette by hem;
and there be jentilmen sones of lesse reputacion that hath mony more
lyberal x. tymez than he hath, and soo in that they seyd Waynflet seyd
it were full necessary for you to remembre, &c.

As for tydyngs here bee noon newe, &c. I truste I shal brynge you a
letter from my mayster your sone, or thanne I come, for whych I shal
rather thanne fayle abyde on day the lenger. And Jesu have you, my right
honourable maister, in Hyse mercyfull governaunce, and preserve you from
adversyte. Wretyn at London, on Seynt Bertylmewys Evyn.

I can speke with noo man but that thynke the gydyng of youre adversary
hath been in many causez ryght straunce, and as it is soposyd that he
shal undyrstonde at the Parlament; but for Gods sake have men inow
aboute yow, for ye undyrstonde is on manerly dysposecion.

  Your bedeman and servaunt,

  JOHN RUSSE.

    1461. He was at Gloucester on the 11th September, and at Ludlow
    on the 21st, as appears by the dates of his privy seals. The

JOHN PASTON, THE ELDEST SON, TO HIS FATHER[301.1]

_To my rythg reverent and worchypfoll fader, John Paston, Esquyer,
dwellyng in Heylysdon, be thys letter delyvered in haste._

[Sidenote: 1461 / AUG. 23]

Most reverent and worschepfull fadyr, I rekomawnd me hertyly, and
submytt me lowlely to your good faderhood, besechyng yow for cheryte of
yowr dayly blyssyng. I beseche yow to hold me ascewsyd that I sente to
yowe none erste no wrythgtyng, for I kowd not spede to myn intent the
maters that ye sent to me for. I have laboryd dayly my Lord of Essexe,
Treserer of Ynglond, to have mevyd the Kyng bothe of the maner [of]
Deddham and of the byll copye of the Corte Roll, everye mornyng ore he
went to the Kyng, and often tymys inqueryd of hym and he had mevyd the
Kyng in these matyers. He answeryd me naye, seyyng it was no tyme, and
seyd he wold it war osse fayne spedd os I myselfe, offed tymys de
layding me that in trouthe I thowt to have send yowe word that I felyd
by hym that he was not wyllyng to meve the Kyng ther in. Neverthe lesse
I lawberyd to hym contynually, and prayed Barronners hys man to remembyr
hym of it. I told offten tyms to my seyd Lord that I had a man teryyn in
town, that I schuld a sente to yow for othyr sundry maters, and he
teryid for no thyng but that I mythg send yowe by hym an answer of the
seyd matyers; othyr tyms besechyng hym to spede me in theys matyers for
thys cawse, that ye schulde thynke no defawte in me for remembryng in
the seyd maters.

And nowe of late, I, rememberyng hym of the same mater, inqueryd if he
had mevyd the Kyngs Hythgnes therin; and he answeryd me that he hadde
felte and mevyd the Kyng ther in, rehersyng the Kyngys answer therin;
how that, when he had mevyd the Kyng in the seyd maner of Dedham,
besechyng hym to be yowr good Lord ther in, konsyderyng the servyse and
trewe part that ye have done, and owthg to hym, and in espesyal the
rygth that ye have therto, he seyd he wold be your good Lord therin as
he wold be to the porest man in Inglond. He wold hold with yowe in yowr
rygth; and as for favor, he wyll nogth be under stand that he schal
schewe favor mor to one man then to anothyr, nowgth to on in Inglond.

And as for the bille copyd of the Cort Rolle, when he mevyd to him of
it, he smylyd and seyd that suche a bylle ther was, seyyng that ye wold
an oppressyd sundreys of yowr contremen of worchypfull men, and the for
he kepyd it styll. Never the lesse he seyd he schuld loke it uppe in
haste, and he schuld have it.

Baronners undertoke to me twyes ore thryes that he schuld so a'
remembred hys lord and master,[302.1] that I schuld au had it with inne
ij. or iij. dayes. He is often tyms absent, and therfor I have it nowthg
yyt; when I kan gete it, I schall send it yowe, and of the Kyngs mowth,
hys name that take it hym.

I scend you home Pekok a geyn. He is not for me. God send grace that he
may do yow good servyse, that be extymacion is not lykelye. Ye schall
have knowleche aftyrward how he hathe demenyd hym her with me. I wold,
savyng yowr dysplesure, that ye were delyvered of hym, for he schalle
never do yow profyte ner worchyp.

I suppose ye understand that the monye that I hadde of yowe att Londun
maye not indur with me tyll that the Kyng goo in to Walys an kome ageyn,
for I under stand it schall be long or he kome ageyn. Wher for I have
sent to Londun to myn onkyl Clement to gete an C_s._ of Christofyr
Hansom yowr servaunt, and sene [_send_] it me be my seyd servaunt, and
myn herneys with it, whyche I lefte at Lundun to make klene.

I beseche yowe not to be dysplesyd with it, for I kowd make non othyr
cheysaunce [_arrangement_] but I schuld a boruyed it of a strange man,
sum of my felawys, who I suppose schold not lyke yowe, and ye herd of it
a nothyr tyme. I ame in suerte wher as I schall have a nothyr maun in
the stede of Pekoke.

My Lord of Estsexe seythe he wyll do as myche for yowe as for any
esquyer in Inglond, and Beronners hys man telht me, seyy[n]g, 'Yowr
fadyr is myche be holdyng to my Lord, for he lovyth hym well.' Bernners
mevyd me ons, and seyd that ye must nedys do sum wate for my Lord and
hys, and I seyd I wost well that ye wold do for hym that laye in yowre
powar. And he seyd that ther was a lytyl mony be twyxe yowe and a
jantylman of Estsexe, callyd Dyrward, seyyng that ther is as myche be
wern [_between_] my seyd Lord and the seyd jantylman, of the wyche mony
he desieryth yowr part.

It is talkyd here how that ye and Howard schuld a' strevyn togueder on
the scher daye, and on of Howards men schuld a' strekyn yow twyess with
a dagere, and soo ye schuld a ben hurt but for a good dobelet that ye
hadde on at that tyme. Blyssyd be God that ye hadde it on. No mor I
wryth to yower good faderhod at thys tym, but All myghty God have yowe
in Hys kepyng, and sende yowe vyttorye of yowr elmyes [_enemies_], and
worschyp in cressyng to yowr lyvys end yn. Wrytyn at Lewys, on Seynt
Bertylmwes Eve.

CLEMENT PASTON TO JOHN PASTON[303.1]

_To hys rythe reverent and worchypfwll broder, John Paston._

[Sidenote: 1461 / AUG. 25]

Rythe reverent and worchypfwll broder, I recomawnde me to yowr good
broderhood, desieryng to herre of zour welfar and good prosperite, the
gwyche I pray God encresse to His pleswr and zowr herts hesse [_heart's
ease_]; certyfyyng zow that I have spok with John Rwsse, and Playter
spok with him bothe, on Fryday be for Seynt Barthelmw. He tolde us of
Howards gydyng, gwyche mad us rythe sory tyl we herde the conclusion
that ze hadde non harme.

Also I understond by W. Pekok that my nevew hadde knowleche ther of also
up on Saterday nexst be for Seynt Barthelmwe, in the Kyngs howse. Not
with standyng, up on the same day Playter and I wryte letters on to him,
rehersyng al the mater, for cause if ther wer ony questionys mevyd to
hym ther of, that he xwlde telle the trowthe, in cas that the qwestions
wer mevyd by ony worchypfwll man, and namyd my Lord Bowcher,[304.1] for
my Lord Bowcher was with the Kyng at that tyme.

I fele by W. Pekok that my nevew is not zet verily aqweyntyd in the
Kyngs howse, nor with the officers of the Kyngs howse he is not takyn as
non of that howse; for the coks [_cooks_] be not charged to serve hym,
nor the sewer[304.2] to gyve hym no dyche, for the sewer wyll not tak no
men no dyschys till they be comawndyd by the cownterroller. Also he is
not aqweyntyd with no body but with Weks;[304.3] and Weks ad told hym
that he wold bryng hym to the Kyng, but he hathe not zet do soo. Wherfor
it were best for hym to tak hys leve and cum hom, til ze hadd spok with
swm body to helpe hym forthe, for he is not bold y now to put forthe hym
selfe. But than I consyderyd that if he xwld now cum hom, the Kyng wold
thyng [_think_] that wan he xwld doo hym ony servie som wer, that than
ze wold have hym hom, the qwyche xwld cause hym not to be hadde in
favor; and also men wold thynke that he wer put owte of servic. Also W.
Pekok tellythe me that his mony is spent, and not ryotesly, but wysly
and discretly, for the costs is gretter in the Kyngs howse qwen he
rydythe than ze wend it hadde be, as Wyllam Pekok can tell zow; and
therof wee must gett hym jC_s._ at the lest, as by Wyllam Pekoks seyyng,
and zet that will be to lytill, and I wot well we kan not get xl_d._ of
Christifyr Hanswm. So I xall be fayn to lend it hym of myn owne silver.
If I knew verily zour entent wer that he xwld cum hom, I wold send hym
non. Ther I wyll doo as me thynkithe ze xwld be best plesyd, and that me
thynkythe is to send him the silver. Ther for I pray zow hastely as ze
may send me azen v. mark, and the remnawnte, I trow, I xall get up on
Christofir Hanswm and Lwket. I pray zow send me it as hastely as ze may,
for I xall leve my selfe rythe bare; and I pray zow send me a letter how
ze woll that he xull be demenyd. Wrytyn on Twsday after Seynt
Barthelmwe, &c. Christus vos conservet!

_To myn welbeloved frende, Sir Thomas Howys, Parson of Blofeld._

[Sidenote: 1461 / AUG. 28]

Welbeloved frende, I grete you well. And for as muche as I understonde
that William Wurcester, late the servant unto Sir John Fastolf, Knyth,
whois soule God assoyle, ys not had in favour ne trust with my right

[Sidenote: 1461 / SEPT. 6]

Please your mastirship to wete that I have be at Cotton, and spoke with
Edward Dale, and he told me that Yelverton and Jenney were there on
Friday,[308.2] and a toke distresse of xxvj. or more bullokks of the
seid Edwards in the Park, and drofe hem to a town therby; and a
neyghbore there undirstandyng the bests were Edward Dalis,[308.3] and
bond hym to pay the ferme, or ellis to bryng in the bests be a day. And
whan the seid Edward undirstod the takyng of the seid bests he went to
Yelverton and Jenney, and bond hym in an obligacon of x_li._, to pay hem
his ferme at Mighelmes; whech I told hym was not well do, for I told hym
ye had be abill to save hym harmeles. And because of discharge of his
neyghbour he seid he myght non other wise do. Nevirthelesse as for mony
thei get none of hym redely, ner of the tenaunts nowthyr, as he can
thynk yet. The seid Yelverton dyned on Friday at Cotton, and there
chargid the tenaunts thei shuld pay no mony but to hym, and hath
flaterid hem, and seith thei shall be restorid ayen of such wrongs as
thei have had be Sir Philip Wentworth and other for Master Fastolff; and
because of such tales, your tenaunts owe hym the bettir will. And I
purposid to have gon to Cotton and spoke with the tenaunts, and Edward
Dale told me he supposid thei wold be this day at Nakton. And because
[I desired][308.4] to speke with hem as ye comaundid me, I terid not but
rod to Ipwich to my bed, and there at the Sonne was the seid Yelverton
and Jenney and Thomas Fastolff; and myn ost told me, that the same aftir
none thei had be at Nakton, but what thei ded there I can not telle, and
whan I was undirstand your man, Hogon, Jenneys man, askyd suerte of pes
of me; and Jenney sent for an officer to have hed me to prison; and so
myn ost undirtoke for me that nyght. And this day in the mornyng I wente
to Sen Lauerauns Chirche; and there I spak to hem and told hem ye
merveylid that thei wold take any distresse or warne any of your
tenaunts that thei shuld pay yow no mony. And Yelverton seid ye had take
a distresse falsly and ontrewly of hym that ought yow no mony ner hem
nowther. And he seid he was infeffid as well as ye; and as for that I
told hym he wost odre [_knew the contrary_], and thow he were it was but
your use, and so I told hym that men were infeffid in his lond, and that
he shuld be servid the same withinne fewe dayes. And he seid he wost
well ye were not infeffid in his lond, and if ye toke upon yow to make
any trobill in his lond ye shall repente it. And also he seid that he
wold do in like wise in alle maners that were Sir John Fastolffs in
Norfolk as thei have begonne, and other langage as I shall telle yow.
And so I am with the gayler, with a clogge upon myn hele for suerte of
the pees; wherefore please your mastirship to send me your avise.

Item, John Andrews was with hem at Cotton, and thei have set a man of
the seid Andrews to kepe the plase.

Item, Wymondham, Debenham and Tympirle come to Yelverton this day at
masse and speke with hym; and I speke to Tymperle in your name that he
wold not comforte ner be with hem ayein in this mater; and he seid he
undirstod no such thyng, ner it was not his comyng hedir. Wretyn at

_To the right reverent and wurchepfull Sir, and my gode mayster, John
Paston, Esquyer._

[Sidenote: 1461 / SEPT. 24]

Right reverent and wurchepfull sir, I recomand me to your gode

Monday at nyght next comyng. Wherfor I have left my heraund with her.
But she seth that he shall not mown comyn [_be able to come_] to you,

shall do the herand to hym.

As for Yelverton, I dede a gode fele to enquer of Yemmys Skynner whan

And for Godds love be not to longe fro London, for men seyn ther, as I

ther is gret noyse of this revell that was don in Suffolk be Yelverton
and Jeney; and your wele willers thynkyn that if thei myght prevayle in

preserve you from all evill. And at the reverence of God lete sum
interposicion go a twix you and my mastres your moder or ye go to
London, and all that ye do shall spede the better; for she is set on
gret malyce, and every man that she spekith with knowith her hert, and
it is like to be a fowle noyse [over] all the countre with aught it be
sone sesid.

Also, sir, it is told me that my Lord of Norfolk is comyn to
Framlyngham, and that ye be gretly comendyd in his howshold. Therfor it

CLEMENT PASTON TO JOHN PASTON[313.1]

_To his right reverent and worshipfull broder, John Paston, Esquier, be
this delivered in great haste._

[Sidenote: 1461 / OCT. 11]

Brother, I recommende me to you. After all dewe recommendacions, &c.
Sir, it was tolde me by rythe a worshipfull man that loveth you rythe
well, and ye him, and ye sall knowe his name hereafter, but put all
things out of doubt he is such a man as will not lye: on the xj^th day
of October the Kinge said, 'We have sent two privy sealys to Paston by
two yeomen of our chamber, and he disobeyeth them; but we will send him
anoder tomorrowe, and by Gods mercye, and if he come not then he sall
dye for it. We will make all oder men beware by him how they sall
disobey our writinge. A servant of our hath made a complainte of him.
I cannot thinke that he hath informed us all truely, yet not for that,
we will not suffer him to disobey our writinge; but sithen he disobeyeth
our writinge, we may beleve the better his gydinge is as we be
informed.' And therwith he made a great avowe that if he [_ye_] come not
at the third commandement ye xulde dye therefore. This man that told me
this is as well learned a man as any is in England; and the same xj^th
day of October, he advised me to send a man to yow in all the hast that
might be to lett yow have knowlache, and that ye xulde not lett for none
excuse, but that ye xulde make the man good cheere and come as hastily
ye might to the Kinge, for he understandeth so much that the King will
keep his promise. Notwithstanding, by mine advice, if ye have his letter
or the messenger come to you, come to the Kinge wards or ye meet with
him, and when ye come ye must be suer of a great excuse. Also if ye doe
well, come right stronge, for Howards wife made her bost that if any of
her husbands men might come to yow ther yulde goe noe penny for your
life; and Howard hath with the Kinge a great fellowship.

This letter was written the same day that the Kinge said these words,
and the same day that it was told me, and that day was the xj^th day of
October as abovesaid; and on the next morning send I forth a man to yow
with this letter, and on the same day send the Kinge the third privye
seale to you. Also he that tolde me this seid that it were better for
yow to come up than to be fotte out of your house with streingth, and to
abide the Kings judgement therin, for he will take your contumacy to
great displeasure. Also, as I understand, the Duke of Norffolk hath made
a great complaint of yow to the King, and my Lord of Suffolk[314.1] and
Howard and Wyngfelde helpe well to every day and call upon the King
against yow. The Kinge is at this day at Grenewich, and ther will be
still till the Parliament beginne. Some say he will goe to Walsingham,
but Mr. Sotyll seid in the aulle in the Temple that he harde no worde of
any such pilgrimage. No more, &c. Written the xj^th day of October at
midnight.

My nevew John tolde me also that he supposed ther were out proclamacions
against yow, &c. the same day.

  By CLEMENT PASTON,

  your broder.

RICHARD CALLE TO JOHN PASTON[315.1]

_To my ryght reverent and wurschipfull maystre, my mastre John Paston._

[Sidenote: 1461 / OCT. 13]

Plesith it your maystreschip to witte that Mr. John and I, with other
mo, have ben at Cotton on Friday[315.2] last passed, and there Jenney
had do warned the corte there to be the same Friday, and he was at Eye
at the cescions the Thorsday before; and on the Friday in the mornynge
he was comyng to Cotton to hoolde the corte there. And it fortuned we
had entred the place or he come; and he herd therof and turned bac a
yein to Oxon[315.3] to my Lorde of Norwiche, and there dyned with hym.
And my Lorde sent Mr. John Colleman to Cotton Halle to speke with you;
and at hes comyng he undrestode ye were not there, and if ye had, my
Lorde desired you to come and spoken with hym, and that my Lorde desired
to put your matre in a trety; in so moche that Mr. John Colleman tolde
to my master, John Paston, that diverse of your elmees [_enemies_] had
labored to my Lorde to have a trety if he cowde brynge it aboute, &c.
And as for the tenaunts they wolde not come at the place on to the tyme
that I sent for hem, for they sey pleynly they woll not have a do with
hem; and so the corte whas holden in your name, and the tenaunts ryght
weele plesed ther of, excepte Thurnberne and Agas, and as for any
socour, they have there ryght noone at all. And so Mr. John whas ther
Friday all day and Saterday tyll none; and than he toke hes horse with
xxx. men with hym and rode to Jeney place, and toke there xxxvj. heede
of nete, and brought hem in to Norfolk; and so whas I left still at
Cotton with xij. men with me, be cauce they reporte and we abode there
ij. dayes we schulde be pult out be the heeds. And so we a mode [?
_abode_] there v. dayes and kepte the place, and I walked aboute all the
lordeschippes and spake with all the fermours and tennaunts that longen
to the maner to undrestande her disposessyon and to receyve money of
hem; and I fynde [them] ryght weele disposed to you. And be cauce the
corte whas warned in ther name and not in youre, therfore they purvey no
money; but they have promysed me to pay no money to no man but to you,
so that ye woll safe hem harmeles; and I told hem ye wold safe hem
harmeles. They have apoynted with me to make redy her money withinne a
fornyght aftre Halowemesse, &c. I have receyved of the tenaunts that I
undrestod out [_owed_] you werst wyll viij. marc, &c. And as for Edward
Dalys money it is redy, so that your maistreschip woll se that he be not
hurt be hes obligacion. Ferthermore, plesit your maistreschip to sende
worde if they entre into the maner ayein, how we schall be rwled and
gidyd; for the tenaunts fere hem they wol entre whan we be gon, and than
wol they distreyne the tenaunts, for they sey there that my Lorde of
Cauntyrbury and other Lords woll relese to hem, notwithstandyng that I
have enformed hem other wice; wherfore, savyng your better advice, me
semethe it were ryght weele doo that ye had a letter of my Lorde of
Cauntirbury, and other to the tenaunts of Cotton that it is her wyll and
entent that ye schulde have the rwle and gouernaunce, and receyve the
money of that maner, and other that were Sir John Fastolff, on whom God
have mercy, for I dought not and suche a lettre came downe to the

RICHARD CALLE TO JOHN PASTON, JUNIOR[318.1]

_To the right worschipfull sir and maistre, John Paston jun., esquyer._

[Sidenote: 1461 / OCT.]

Ryght worschipfull sir, I recomaunde me unto your mastreschip,
certifiyng you that Jenney and Yelverton hathe certified up in to the
Kynges Benche inssurrecions [and] congregacions a yenste me; wherupon
they have sente to the scheryff a writte chargyng hym in peyne of C_li._
to brynge me in to the Kyngs Benche the morwe after Sein Marteyn. And
this daye the seide Jenney hathe sent doune to the scheryff an other
writte called an _habeas corpus_ retornable _crastino Animarum_, weche
schalbe on Twesday next comyng be cauce they were in dought and in
greete feere that I schulde have ben aquytte of the inditement of
fellony now at this gayle delyverye. And also my maistre hathe sente an
other writte for me retornable at the seid _crastino Animarum_. And so I
am like to ride to London warde to morwe. And the scheryff wold make me
to fynde suerte that I schulde appere in the Kyngs Benche the seid daye;
and yet, that notwithstandyng, he wolde send me with strengthe of men as
a presoner; and if any thynge schall cauce me that I goo not up to
London, it schalbe be cauce I woll fynde no suerte; for in cas he wold
have suffred me to have gon up be my selfe at myn owne coste, I wolde
have founde hym suertee. And so at the makyng of this bille we were not
fully condesended hough we schulde doo. My mastre is in goode hele,
blissed be Godd, and dothe and schall doo ryght weele in alle hes
maters. Ther is an ongracious felaschip of hem and a fals. They have
sent for Fitzraff and Schipdam, be a citacion for the proffe of the
testement, and alle is but for to delay it; yet it were weele done ye
rode over to Fitzraff and felte hes disposicion how he woll be disposed,
and in like wice with Schipdam, for I have spoken with hem of that
matre, in cas that any citacion come doun for hem, how they wolde be
disposed, and I have founde the too straunchely disposed. God send us a
good scheryf thys yere, and thanne we schalle do weele inough, be the
grace of God.

And, sir, your man tolde me that ye desired to knowe the demenyng at
Cotton of the tenaunts and other. I lete you wete the moste parte of
alle the tenaunts have bene here with me for to see me, and they have
tolde me all the demenyng as it is undrewrete. Furst, as for the money
that they receyved there it drwe upon a xxiiij^ti _li._ and more silver,
for the tenaunts myght not cheese but they moste nedes paye, for they
distreyned on my Lords of Suffolk fee, my Lords of Norwich fee, and on
all men grounde, so that they myght not have her catell in reste, weche
cauced hem to paye her money. I knowe weele i nough who payed and wo
paied not. All the grete fermours have payed. And as for the kepyng of
the place ther be therin iiij. men, and on of Debenham men, called
Sokelyng, and hes wyff, and on Mannyng, a tenaunt, a fals knave; and
they have enforced them as stronke as they kan, and they have broken
doune the brigge and have leide a planke over, in cas that ye go theder
ye may not come at Dale is howce in no waie, for he have had meche
trouble for my mastre and for me; but and ye wolde gete my Lords meane
and pulle the knaves out be the heede, it were weele done. I purpose me
to com hom warde that same wey. Item, I lete you witte that the gayle
delyverye holdeth not this daye, and alle is doone be cauce of mee,
Jenney wolde not lete the clerke of peas come hether this daye for feere
that I schulde have been aquytte of the felonye, for in trouthe and tho
it had holden, I had founde the meane for to have ben quytte, for I whas
through with the scheryff and panel made aftyr myn avice; but though the
gayle delyver had holden, I cowde not have ben delyverd, becauce of thes
writtes that be come downe. Item, the scheryff hathe a grete losse that
this daye holdethe not, for ther schulde have ben quytte xl. men this
daye. Item, the scheryff tolde me that my maistre tolde hym that I whas
assent to my takyng at Scoolys, weche was to me ryght greete hevynes and
discomforture nough in my trouble. And God knoweth it was never my wylle
ner myn entent, as I mot be saved at the dredful day of Dome; for ther
is no man so sore hurte as I am be the takyng, bothe in losse, and also
in reprefe of myn owne persoune and of my frends, withoute that my
mastre be my good maistre, as I truste he wolle be, or elles I am
disseyved. He hathe my trewe servyce and shal have whylle that I leve,
what so ever his mastreschip do to me, but I can thynke he hathe be
enformed be myn elmyes [_enemies_] that wold make hym disp[l]esed with
me, and to be myn evy [_heavy_] mastre, but dissimulacion dothe muche
harme, &c. I reporte me, &c. No more to you at this tyme, but Jesu kepe
you, and send you as much fortune and grace as I wolde ye had, &c.
I beseche [you] to be my goode mastre as ye have be, for I never
deserved nor wol deserve the contrary.

  Your servaunt, RIC. CALLE,

  presoner.

    [Footnote 318.1: [From Paston MSS., B.M.] This letter was
    written in a year in which the morrow of All Souls' Day (_i.e._
    the 3rd November) fell on Tuesday. The Dominical letter of the
    year must therefore be D. This was the case in 1461, and no
    other year will suit a letter addressed to John Paston, junior.
    For if we go back there is no earlier year in which D was the
    Dominical letter till we come to 1450, when John Paston, junior,
    was only ten years old; and if we go forward the next is 1467,
    which was after John Paston the father's death.]

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
