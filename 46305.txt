      Start your glorious western vacation at GALLATIN GATEWAY INN


Composed in equal parts of natural beauty, mystery and fascination,
Yellowstone Park has long taken rank as one of America's and the world's
show places. Recently it has entertained as many as a million visitors
in a single summer.

Now _you_ are planning a Yellowstone vacation. We propose, in this
booklet, to give you a foretaste of the wonders that lie ahead. To show
you some of the advantages of entering the Park via the scenic Gallatin
Gateway, and to suggest the entertainment possibilities of a few extra
days spent at Gallatin Gateway Inn.

Gallatin Gateway Inn lies about thirty-five miles south of Three Forks,
Montana, on the mainline of The Milwaukee Road. The Inn was built by the
Railroad and is now privately operated for the convenience of
Yellowstone passengers as well as for the entertainment of guests who
wish to stay over for a short time.

Of modified Spanish design, the hospitable Inn is surrounded by the
green, irrigated meadows of the lovely Gallatin valley. In the
background rise the timber-clad mountains of the Bridger, Gallatin and
Madison ranges of the Montana Rockies.

At its elevation of almost 5,000 feet, the climate is ideal throughout
the summer months. There is a high percentage of bright, sunny days yet
it is always cool enough at night to enjoy the comfort of woolen
blankets.

Passengers for Yellowstone on The Milwaukee Road's COLUMBIAN taking
regular Park tours have only an hour or two at the Inn. However,
passengers on the new Olympian HIAWATHA arrive at the Inn in
mid-afternoon and do not ordinarily leave for the Park till next day
after lunch. With a knowledge of the Inn and its facilities, you can
plan to take fullest advantage of your time there. And, of course, you
may decide to extend your stay.

Set in wide lawns and gardens, Gallatin Gateway Inn is a delightfully
comfortable place. It has bright, airy bedrooms, a spacious two-story
living room, a sun-lit dining room and the friendly Corral cocktail
lounge. The food is procured from the Inn's own gardens, from nearby
farms and ranches, and from markets along the route of The Milwaukee
Road. Prepared by skilled chefs and expertly served, it is guaranteed to
be just right for the hearty appetites generated by mountain air.

[Illustration: Outdoor activities and mountain air are a combination
that make Gallatin Inn's famous food taste even better.]

[Illustration: The bedrooms, far right, are airy and comfortable.]

Your genial host at Gallatin Gateway Inn combines a full understanding
of hotel operation with an intimate knowledge of the surrounding
country. His staff takes pride in seeing that you enjoy every minute of
your stay.

On your way to or from Yellowstone, a few days at the Inn will prove a
pleasant interlude. You can spend those days in quiet loafing, in active
sports, or in making exploratory trips.

The swift flowing Gallatin river offers fine trout fishing just a short
walk from the door. Archery, clock golf and tennis may be enjoyed right
on the spacious grounds. Whatever you do you'll like the comfort and the
congenial atmosphere of Gallatin Gateway Inn.

                           OFF TO YELLOWSTONE


Chance turned the footsteps of the first white man toward Yellowstone.
In 1807, John Colter, a member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, was
wounded in an Indian battle near Jackson Hole. In escaping, he journeyed
northward and penetrated Yellowstone as far as what is now known as
Tower Falls.

More than twenty years later, Jim Bridger, a famous frontier guide, also
entered the region that had come to be known as "Colter's Hell" and
verified the fantastic tales of his predecessor. But even then, no one
accepted the story. Colter and Bridger were in the position of Marco
Polo who had discovered an empire so strange that its very existence was
doubted.

Not until 1870, when a public exploring party made a thorough study of
the region, were its wonders accepted as fact. Then, action quickly
followed. In 1872 a bill was introduced before congress and speedily
passed, that established Yellowstone as the first of our National Parks.
A vast rectangle of 3,438 square miles lying in the northwest corner of
Wyoming and overlapping into Montana and Idaho, Yellowstone is a broad,
volcanic plateau with an average elevation of 8,000 feet, and with
mountain peaks in and around the park rising as high as ten and twelve
thousand feet ... more than two million enchanted acres with the
greatest and most varied array of wonders in all the earth.

[Illustration: Luggage and cars.]

But all this is recent history. Take a brief look at the amazing past of
Yellowstone. Millions of years ago, the present high plateau was a
parched, arid plain sheltered behind the buttresses of the continent's
two great mountain ranges--Appalachia in the East and Cascadia in the
West. Slowly, the land sank and Yellowstone was buried a hundred fathoms
deep under the arctic waters of the Sundance Sea. As the invading waters
retreated, a shift in temperature changed Yellowstone into a huge
subtropical marsh where giant dinosaurs drowsed and fed in the green
half-light that filtered down through jungle trees.

The next great geologic change saw Yellowstone thrust skyward by the
slow buckling of earth's crust ... scorched and shaken by a million
years of volcanic activity ... covered by a vast sea of molten rhyolite.
The hot lava slowly cooled and was in turn engulfed by creeping rivers
of blue-green glacial ice.

As this new ice age withdrew, countless sediment-bearing streams roared
down from the melting glaciers and, aided by the bitter winds of high
places, began carving Yellowstone into its present form.

[Illustration: The Cathedrals are natural Gothic spires of hard stone
that resisted erosion by the river when it carved the deep gorge of
Gallatin Canyon. These formations are especially beautiful under a
Montana moon.]

[Illustration: Man with camera.]

Even today, Yellowstone is a "young" land that is undergoing relatively
rapid changes. The subterranean heat that causes its geyser activity is
slowly subsiding.

Old geysers die out and new ones grow in power and regularity.
Imperceptibly, the canyons deepen, and erosion carves new patterns on
rocky walls.

This is the land ... rich in forests and wild life, and gemmed with
sparkling mountain lakes ... that has been set aside for the perpetual
enjoyment of our people. This is Yellowstone, oldest and greatest of
America's National Parks.

Your trip to Yellowstone via The Milwaukee Road takes you through the
most spectacular of all entrances--Gallatin Gateway.

You leave the train at Three Forks, Montana, on the main
transcontinental line of The Milwaukee Road. Just outside of town the
Gallatin, Madison and Jefferson rivers flow together to form the
headwaters of the mighty Missouri.

Lewis and Clark's expedition camped here in 1805 on their way to the
Pacific Northwest. There is a bronze tablet in the town park dedicated
to Sacajawea, the Indian girl who guided the explorers. Three Forks was
established as a trading post for the Missouri Fur Company in 1810.

[Illustration: Pale shades of gray, buff, yellow and orange-red give
rich color to the face of Sheep Mountain in Gallatin Canyon. Dark
conifers cling to the lower slopes.]

Leaving the train, you board a motor coach for a delightful drive of a
little over an hour to Gallatin Gateway Inn.

[Illustration: Accurately carved by a strange quirk of nature, Pulpit
Rock towers high above the Gallatin Valley. Formations of this kind are
not too unusual, and result when a core of hard rock is surrounded by
softer material.]

[Illustration: Mountain view.]

[Illustration: Yellowstone-bound, a Park motor coach starts up the
Gallatin Valley with Castle Rock in the background. The comfortable
buses have roll-back tops that permit full views of the surrounding
rocky walls.]

[Illustration: Riverside Geyser is an irregular performer that sends its
plume-like jet diagonally out over the Firehole River. Higher up, the
Firehole is a good fishing stream, but here its waters are strongly
charged with minerals from the geysers and hot springs.]

[Illustration: A bus load of visitors has stopped for a look at Old
Faithful shooting its mighty column skyward.]

[Illustration: The Ranger at the far right indicates one of the hundreds
of tinted pools that dot the geyser basins.]


                       First Stop ... Geyserland

One of the chief attractions of entering Yellowstone via Gallatin
Gateway is the 80 mile motor trip through glorious mountain country that
you enjoy without extra charge.

Promptly after lunch, you leave Gallatin Gateway Inn in one of the
luxurious motor coaches of the Yellowstone Park Company and begin the
trip southward.

In a short time you enter spectacular Gallatin Canyon. Just beyond
Roaring Creek lie the huge, eroded battlements of Castle and Cathedral
Rocks, majestic cliffs that dwarf the tiny river flowing swiftly at
their base. This is the famed Montana dude ranch country, and you
glimpse many of the ranches in the innumerable little valleys that are
tributary to the Gallatin.

You'll see Sagebrush Point where the Gallatin flows in a graceful
S-curve hundreds of feet below the road ... the broad cone of Lone
Mountain rising to a height of ten thousand feet and Pulpit Rock, oddly
and accurately carved by some freak of Nature.

Perhaps you'll catch sight of a moose feeding on lily roots in a pond
beside the road, or a band of elk emerging warily from the timber. Over
there is a new beaver dam, and that gray shadow skirting the road is a
coyote.

[Illustration: Feeding a fawn.]

[Illustration: Old Faithful Inn is said to be one of the highest and
largest log buildings in the world. Its pleasantly rustic public rooms
have long made it a favorite with Park visitors. Facilities are
exceptionally complete.]

Crossing dozens of creeks with picturesque, western names, you enter the
boundaries of Yellowstone. Again leaving the Park, the road winds
through the Madison National Forest, skirts Hebgen Lake, crosses the
Madison and brings you to West Yellowstone--your official entrance to
the Park.

[Illustration: Its curiously formed cone has earned it the name of
Grotto Geyser. In its two major basins, Yellowstone has more active
geysers than all the rest of the world, but you'll never tire of their
varied fascination.]

[Illustration: Cowboy with guitar.]

The Motor trip from Gallatin Gateway is a perfect introduction to
Yellowstone, and shows you country unlike any within the Park.


                        Here Comes Old Faithful

From West Yellowstone, the route follows the Madison through Christmas
Tree Park, and then down the lovely valley of the Firehole River into
geyserland. There are more geysers in Yellowstone than in all the rest
of the world, and the greatest of them are here in the Lower and Upper
Basins. The hiss of steam, low, subterranean mutterings and the roar of
geysers in action make this landscape a scene from the Inferno. You see
Fountain, Great Fountain, Riverside and Giant geysers, Morning Glory
Pool and Fountain Paint Pot, and reach Old Faithful for dinner and the
night.

The most famous geyser in the world, Old Faithful may be depended upon
to stage its almost hourly shows for your special benefit. Approximately
every sixty-five minutes it growls and hisses for a moment, and then
leaps into action sending its glorious plume of boiling water 120 or
more feet into the sky.

Old Faithful is a perfect spot for your first stay in Yellowstone and
offers a variety of attractions that will make your time here seem all
too short. Besides the many nearby geysers, you will see the iridescent
turquoise of Morning Glory Pool with its flower-tinted cone ... Black
Sand Pool and Sapphire Springs ... Firehole Lake with its flame-like
streamers of gas bubbling to the surface, Chinaman Pool and numerous
other steaming pools and springs.

[Illustration: Yellowstone's Ranger-Naturalists are always on hand to
give interesting explanations of the numberless wonders of the Park.]

[Illustration: Shopping for souvenirs.]

[Illustration: Giant Geyser, though an irregular performer, is the
largest in the Park. At full discharge it sends its huge stream of
boiling water and steam from 200 to 250 feet in the air. The rumble and
roar of the geysers can be heard for long distances in the clear
mountain air.]

[Illustration: Across the Firehole River clouds of drifting steam mark
the Firehole Geyser Basin--another reason why beautiful Yellowstone is
the most photographed of our National Parks.]

There is an enclosed swimming pool and a museum. A variety of short
walking trips may be taken with the ranger-naturalists, and longer trips
made on horseback with colorful wranglers who know the phenomena of the
Park.

Old Faithful Inn itself is built wholly of native materials. Within its
friendly walls, you dine, dance, play and meet congenial fellow
travelers before the great open fireplace.

The following day, your caravan moves on from Old Faithful past the
beautiful Kepler Cascades of the Firehole, and over the Continental
Divide. Here is the Rocky Mountain watershed that sends the rivers on
one side flowing down to the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico, and on the
other side, to the Pacific. To the south lie Shoshone Lake and the snowy
peaks of the Teton range.


                        Lovely Yellowstone Lake

At Thumb, the road descends to the shore of Yellowstone Lake. 7,730 feet
above sea level, this huge lake covering more than 130 square miles, is
America's highest navigable body of water. Past Fishing Cone, the road
skirts the shore of the Lake for many miles to the mouth of the
Yellowstone River. Many Yellowstone visitors enjoy fishing or boating on
the lake.

Big, hard-fighting trout of several species inhabit the deep,
perpetually cold waters of the lake, and afford the finest kind of
sport. Boats, guides and fishing tackle are available.

[Illustration: Here is part of the crowd clustered around Old Faithful
as it nears time for an eruption. This famous geyser discharges with
almost clock-like regularity at intervals of about 65 minutes.]

There are also a number of modern speedboats that were painstakingly
hauled up to the lake. These mahogany beauties make regular passenger
trips and give a real thrill as they race over the sparkling water.
Yellowstone Lake is one of the few places in America where you may still
see wild swans--the last survivors of once-numerous flocks of these
majestic birds. Pelicans are plentiful on Molly Island.

[Illustration: Mile-and-a-half high Yellowstone Lake is ringed by the
snow-capped Absaroka mountains.]

But now our tour continues. Winding through beautiful Hayden Valley, the
road continues, for the most part, close beside the Yellowstone River
and then past Mud Volcano. Soon we cross over Chittenden Bridge, pass
the Upper and Lower Falls and reach hospitable Canyon Hotel that is
superbly situated at the head of the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone.

[Illustration: Successful fishermen.]

[Illustration: Pine trees cling precariously to the rocky walls of
Kepler Cascades where the Firehole River drops down a series of
picturesque falls and rapids.]

[Illustration: At the head of the Grand Canyon, the Yellowstone River
roars thunderously down the great falls. Here, from viewpoints on either
side of the canyon, is one of the most gloriously colorful scenes on
this continent.]

[Illustration: Photographing the great falls of the Yellowstone River.]


              Magnificently Colorful ... the Grand Canyon

To many visitors, the Grand Canyon is the highpoint of Yellowstone. And
well it may be, for the views from Artist or Inspiration Points are
scarcely rivaled in all the world. A third of a mile wide and more than
a thousand feet deep, the mighty gorge has been fantastically carved by
the rushing waters of the Yellowstone River. Ranging in tone from pale
lemon to tawny buff, the rock walls of the canyon are splashed with a
hundred shades of crimson, blue and green--a glorious play of color that
changes hourly with the passage of the sun. And far down at the bottom
winds the jade green ribbon of the Yellowstone. Muted by distance, you
hear the thunder of the Great Falls where the river leaps out and down,
308 feet into the gorge.

To those who have seen it, the Canyon remains one of the scenic
highlights of a lifetime. Warm yet delicate in coloring, big but not so
big that it staggers the imagination, the gorge is as perfect and
complete as a flawless gem.

Leaving Canyon Hotel, you continue northward through Dunraven Pass,
where the road climbs the shoulder of Mt. Washburn. If you wish, you may
take the more spectacular route to the very summit of the 10,317 foot
mountain for the finest panorama of the Park.

Soon the road rejoins the Yellowstone River and you see Tower Falls.
Flowing down from the high plateau, Tower Creek plunges down a 132-foot
drop to join the Yellowstone in its long course eastward. Needle-like
volcanic rocks stand sentinel at the head of the falls and nearby are
strange buttresses of hard basalt forming palisades as regular as if
they had been cut by man.

A little farther up the road is a forest of petrified trees. These
fallen giants of hard stone reproduce, in astonishing detail and in a
variety of rich colors, the bark and wood fibers of which they were once
composed.

[Illustration: Painting the waterfall.]

[Illustration: Downstream from the main part of the canyon, the
Yellowstone River winds in a narrow ribbon through the gray and buff
walls of a rocky gorge. With the changing light, the river varies from
silver to jade green.]

[Illustration: Not far from Chittenden Bridge, the Yellowstone plunges
down the Upper Falls. Seen from the lookout platform or from the camera
viewpoint here, the fury and power of the cataract is indescribably
impressive.]

[Illustration: Steps on the trail.]

[Illustration: Looking northeast from Inspiration Point, the canyon of
the Yellowstone spreads its splendor before you. Do an about-face here
and the view is toward the lower falls. Rapids lace the dark water with
creamy foam.]

[Illustration: Automobile tourists.]

[Illustration: Pulpit Terrace at Mammoth Hot Springs has been built up
from the mineral laden waters of hot springs. Ashy white in its dry,
natural state, the rocky walls are tinted rainbow colors by living algae
in the waters.]

[Illustration: Roadside bear.]


                          Fantasy in Stone ...
                            Mammoth Terrace

Built up and sculptured by the hot mineral waters, the smooth terraces
of white stone at Mammoth Hot Springs are given a thousand delicate
tints of vermillion, orange, pink and yellow by the living algae in the
waters. You see Pulpit Terrace, Minerva, Cleopatra, White Elephant and
the Devil's Kitchen.

[Illustration: Here is huge Jupiter Terrace. These colorful formations
change constantly in appearance as one spring temporarily dries up and
another begins to flow. The more water, the more color is the general
rule.]

Southward from Mammoth Hot Springs is Norris Geyser Basin with its
collection of smaller geysers, hot springs and other phenomena. Here you
will see the Black Growler, emitting superheated steam at a temperature
of 284 degrees. The Chocolate Pots just beyond, demonstrate the
remarkable chemical coloring from which they derive their name.

[Illustration: From a bluff just north of the community the buildings of
Mammoth Hot Springs are spread before the camera. This is the
administration center for Yellowstone Park, and, with the tourist
facilities, comprises a small town in itself.]

Depending on the gateway selected for exit from the Park, schedules of
Park tours vary slightly. Complete itineraries for the various tours are
shown elsewhere in this book.

This brief summary is a far from complete outline of what may be seen
and done in Yellowstone. You might profitably spend an entire summer
within the confines of the Park or--as many do--come back repeatedly.


                         Wild Life in Abundance

Yellowstone is a great wild animal refuge where the game is protected
and therefore quite unafraid of humans. You will see dozens and dozens
of the famous bears whose clumsy antics are an unfailing source of
amusement. Among them is the grizzly bear, rightfully the most respected
of all the wild animals. In meeting bears on the roads and paths, never
tease the animals with food.

Almost anywhere in the Park you may catch glimpses of deer, and perhaps
of buffalo, antelope, elk and mountain sheep as well as smaller animals
such as marmots, beaver and chipmunks. You will have ample opportunity
to take short walking trips. You can fish and swim; join community
singing around huge campfires; listen to lectures on the geology and
animal life of the Park; see informal entertainments by the boys and
girls who staff the lodges and hotels; join in the fun of informal
dances.

Whether you have little time or much, no finer vacation spot exists than
magnificent, incredible Yellowstone. Boundless in wonders and in
hospitality, this is your Park, your playground ... the magic land where
dreams come true.

[Illustration: Almost like man-made rice fields are these dikes and
terraces engineered by nature from minerals carried in the waters of the
hot springs.]

                              SUPER DOMES
                     NOW ON THE _OLYMPIAN Hiawatha_


Here's extra fun on your trip to Yellowstone via The Milwaukee Road. The
super-speed Olympian Hiawatha--only one night en route from
Chicago--carries America's first full length domes, the only domes to
the Pacific Northwest.

68 individual lookout seats on the upper deck provide glorious views of
the palisades of the Mississippi, the Belt Mountains, Montana Canyon and
the source of the Missouri near Three Forks. Delightful Cafe Lounge on
the lower deck of the Super Dome car for beverages and snacks. Entire
car is open to all passengers.

Olympian Hiawatha equipment includes private-room cars with the unique
Skytop Lounge. Double bedrooms and roomettes are completely and
luxuriously appointed. Adjoining bedrooms open to form connecting
suites.

Touralux sleepers, built exclusively for this service, offer berth
comfort and privacy at reduced cost. Reserved seat Luxurest coaches have
40 individual chairs with leg rests; spacious lounge-dressing rooms for
men and for women. Dining car features famous Milwaukee Road meals. All
cars are air conditioned and wired for radio or station announcements.


                       The electrified COLUMBIAN

Accommodations in air conditioned standard Pullman sleepers, tourist
sleepers and Hiawatha-type coaches. Electric operation through the Belt
Mountains and Montana Canyon.

Westbound passengers for Yellowstone on the Columbian reach Three Forks
in the morning, have lunch at Gallatin Gateway Inn and leave for the
Park immediately afterward. On the Olympian Hiawatha, you reach Three
Forks in mid-afternoon and remain at the Inn until after lunch the
following day. By eliminating the stay at the Inn, you save money
traveling on the Columbian. There is also some saving of time from
Chicago despite the more leisurely schedule of this train.

                          GENERAL INFORMATION


             Prepaid, All-Expense Tours Personally Escorted

Many Yellowstone Park travelers prefer to travel with special parties of
congenial people under the popular all-expense plan. These tours will be
operated during the Yellowstone Park season and those desiring to join
one of the parties should call on any of the Chicago, Milwaukee, St.
Paul and Pacific Railroad travel bureaus shown on the inside back cover
of this booklet or write direct to Mr. H. Sengstacken, Passenger Traffic
Manager, The Milwaukee Road, Union Station, Chicago 6, Ill.


                            The Park Season

The regular Park season is June 22nd to September 8th.


                          Motor Transportation

The Yellowstone Park Company, under contract with the Government
operates a transportation line between the Park entrances and the
various hotels and points of interest.


                                 Hotels

All service is under the supervision of the Government and is maintained
at a high standard at rates fixed by the Government.

Each hotel is individual in character and architecture, completely and
modernly equipped.

Old Faithful Inn is a striking structure of logs and stone. Its unusual
lobby is 75 feet square and 92 feet high to the peak of the roof, with
balconies around three sides.

Old Faithful Geyser is nearby the Inn, and not far away are many other
geysers too numerous to mention here.

The Canyon Hotel, one of the finest hotels in the country with every
comfort and convenience, is particularly well known for its spacious and
beautiful plate-glass enclosed lounge. It has a wonderful setting high
up on one side of Yellowstone Canyon, not far from the Lower Falls.

Mammoth Hot Springs hotel is most modern in style and appointments.


                              The Climate

Far from the least attraction of an invigorating outing is the climate.
An average elevation of 8,000 feet brings a clear and bracing
atmosphere. Hot mineral baths and outdoor sleeping, best of Nature's
medicines, may be enjoyed throughout the season. During the tourist
season the mean average temperature ranges from 54 deg. to 64 deg. with a
maximum of 88 deg. There is little choice as to the best time for visiting
the Park. Early summer finds more snow in the mountains; August and
September bring floral decorations in all their beauty and charm.


                              What to Wear

Warm clothing should be worn, and one should be prepared for sudden
changes of temperature common at an altitude of 7,500 feet. Men should
have medium weight overcoats and sweaters, and women should have coats
or sweaters. Slacks or riding breeches are recommended for both men and
women. Stout shoes should be worn as they are most comfortable and best
suited for walking about the geysers, terraces and other formations.
Tinted glasses, serviceable gloves and field glasses will be found
useful.


                          Park Administration

Yellowstone, like all other National Parks, is under the supervision of
the National Park Service, with a local superintendent located at
Mammoth Hot Springs, headquarters of the Park administration.


                            Church Services

Religious services are conducted at convenient locations in the park.
Information provided at hotel desks.


                     Medical Service in Yellowstone

Physicians and surgeons with headquarters at Mammoth Hot Springs are
available for call to any place in the Park. Trained nurses and a
dispensary are at each of the hotels in the Park. At Mammoth is a
well-equipped hospital with skilled personnel.


                     Saddle Horse Trips and Guides

Saddle horses, as well as competent guides, are available at all hotels
and lodges at established rates made by the National Park Service. Those
who desire to do so may get far off the beaten path and into the more
remote and scenic regions of the Park.


                Cost of Park Tour from Gallatin Gateway

    (which will be added to the excursion fare to Gallatin Gateway)

          Including Motor Transportation and Meals and Lodging

  For Adults and children 12 years old           $46.75
    and over
  For children 8 years old and under 12           34.25
    years
  For children under 8 years                      24.00

                          (Federal tax extra)

Longer time than is provided by the regular "two-and-one-half days'"
tour may be spent at the stopover points, if desired. For such
additional time, meals and lodging are on the basis of $9.00 to $12.00
per day, American plan. (Children's Tickets for motor transportation and
hotel accommodations are sold at Park entrances only.)


                                Baggage

The Yellowstone Park Company will carry free, two pieces of hand baggage
for each person, not to exceed sixty pounds in total weight, with a
limited liability of $25.00 for each piece for loss or damage.
Passengers desiring additional protection may obtain an insurance policy
at small cost from the transportation agent at Gallatin Gateway. Trunks
cannot be transported in the automobiles. Tourists contemplating a
prolonged trip through the Park can make arrangements with
representatives of the Transportation Company at Gallatin Gateway for
the forwarding of trunks.

Railroads store baggage free at Gallatin Gateway, Three Forks, Butte,
Livingston, Gardiner, Cody, Frannie or Billings, West Yellowstone,
Pocatello, Idaho Falls, Ogden or Salt Lake City, for actual length of
time spent in the Park. Baggage may be checked to Gallatin Gateway,
Gardiner, Cody or West Yellowstone.

  _Passengers entering the Park via one station and leaving via another
  can make arrangements for free checking of baggage to station via
  which they leave the Park._




                 Return via Salt Lake City and Colorado


Many rail travelers from the East and Middle West add to the enjoyment
of their Yellowstone tour by returning over a different route. You can
plan your trip to continue southward from West Yellowstone to Salt Lake
City, then east through Colorado and so home again.

Salt Lake City, originally settled and built by the Mormons, is a clean
and attractive city that rates high in tourist interest. The focal
point, of course, is the great square containing the handsome Mormon
Temple and the smaller Tabernacle with its barrel-vaulted, wooden roof.
Organ recitals are held regularly in this building.

Many brief tours are available to points of outstanding interest. You
will want to visit Saltair on the shores of Great Salt Lake and probably
to take a swim in the amazingly buoyant waters. You also see the vast
and arid salt fields on this trip. Another tour might well be through
Bingham Canyon into the mining country where you see the world's largest
open pit copper mine.

From Salt Lake City, one of the routes east takes you through the
world-renowned Royal Gorge of the Arkansas River, one of the great
scenic thrills of the West. Another scenic route east takes you through
Cheyenne.

From Colorado Springs, the "Sunshine City", motor tours take you through
the beautiful residential section and over High Mesa to the colorful
Garden of the Gods. Then on to Manitou, Seven Falls, Cheyenne Mountain,
the Will Rogers Shrine Memorial, through Ute Pass and up Pyramid
Mountain for a superb view of Pikes Peak and its sisters in the Rockies.

Denver, the mile-high city, has a superb system of parks, the Buffalo
Bill Memorial Museum and the tomb of Buffalo Bill. Scenic drives offer
extraordinary views into Clear Creek Canyon, Bear Creek Canyon and the
gorgeous Red Rocks.

Fast streamliners provide excellent rail service between Denver,
Colorado Springs and Chicago.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
