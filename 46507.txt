                             CAPTAIN HINDE

THE FALL OF THE CONGO ARABS. By Sidney L. Hinde. With Portraits and
Plans. _Demy 8vo. 12s. 6d._

  This volume deals with the recent Belgian Expedition to the Upper
  Congo, which developed into a war between the State forces and the
  Arab slave raiders in Central Africa. Two white men only returned
  alive from the three years' war--Commandant Dhanis and the writer of
  this book, Captain Hinde. During the greater part of the time spent by
  Captain Hinde in the Congo he was amongst cannibal races in
  little-known regions, and, owing to the peculiar circumstances of his
  position, was enabled to see a side of native history shown to few
  Europeans. The war terminated in the complete defeat of the Arabs,
  seventy thousand of whom perished during the struggle.


                              BADEN-POWELL

                        PRINCE HENRI OF ORLEANS

FROM TONKIN TO INDIA. By Prince Henri of Orleans. Translated by Hamley
Bent, M.A. With over 100 Illustrations and 4 Maps. _Demy 8vo. 21s._

  The travels of Prince Henri in 1895 from China to the valley of the
  Bramaputra covered a distance of 2100 miles, of which 1600 was through
  absolutely unexplored country. No fewer than seventeen ranges of
  mountains were crossed at altitudes of from 11,000 to 13,000 feet. The
  journey was made memorable by the discovery of the sources of the
  Irrawaddy. To the physical difficulties of the journey were added
  dangers from the attacks of savage tribes. The book deals with many of
  the burning political problems of the East, and it will be found a
  most important contribution to the literature of adventure and
  discovery.


                                L. DECLE

THREE YEARS IN SAVAGE AFRICA. By Lionel Decle. With an Introduction by
H. M. Stanley, M.P. With 100 Illustrations and 5 Maps. _Demy 8vo. 21s._

  Few Europeans have had the same opportunity of studying the barbarous
  parts of Africa as Mr. Decle. Starting from the Cape, he visited in
  succession Bechuanaland, the Zambesi, Matabeleland and Mashonaland,
  the Portuguese settlement on the Zambesi, Nyasaland, Ujiji, the
  headquarters of the Arabs, German East Africa, Uganda (where he saw
  fighting in company with the late Major 'Roddy' Owen), and British
  East Africa. In his book he relates his experiences, his minute
  observations of native habits and customs, and his views as to the
  work done in Africa by the various European Governments, whose
  operations he was able to study. The whole journey extended over 7000
  miles, and occupied exactly three years.


                              H. S. COWPER

THE HILL OF THE GRACES: or, the Great Stone Temples of Tripoli. By H. S.
Cowper, F.S.A. With Maps, Plans, and 75 Illustrations. _Demy 8vo. 10s.
6d._

  The Turkish prohibition against all European travel in their African
  Pashalics has, during the last seventeen years, rendered impossible
  both geographical and archaeological research. The author, however, was
  enabled to make two journeys through the hill range of Tripoli in 1895
  and 1896, and this volume deals chiefly with a remarkable series of
  megalithic Temples and Trilithons, which he found to exist there in
  extraordinary numbers. These ruins have hitherto been quite
  uninvestigated, and to Englishmen should have an exceptional interest,
  from the light it is believed they will throw on our own national
  monument of Stonehenge. In all about one hundred sites were visited
  and photographed, and the volume will be fully illustrated by maps,
  plans, and photographs. Chapters will also be devoted to modern
  Tripoli, the little visited ruins of Leptes Magna, the ancient and
  modern geography of the district generally, and the author's personal
  experiences.

THE LIFE AND WRITINGS OF JOHN DAVENANT, D.D. (1571-1641), President of
Queen's College, Lady Margaret Professor of Divinity, Cambridge, Lord
Bishop of Salisbury. By the Rev. Morris Fuller, B.D., Vicar of St.
Mark's, Marylebone. _Crown 8vo. 7s. 6d._

  Dr. Davenant, Bishop of Salisbury, the maternal uncle of Dr. Fuller,
  lived at a very critical time in our history (1571-1641). He was one
  of the British representatives of the first great Synod of the
  reformed churches held at Dort, was one of Archbishop Laud's
  Suffragans, and assisted him in carrying out his reforms.

  Precis is given of some of the Bishop's writings, and a very
  celebrated sermon, never before published and supposed to have been
  lost, is printed _in extenso_.

A SHORT HISTORY OF THE ROYAL NAVY, From Early Times to the Present Day.
By David Hannay. Illustrated. _2 Vols. Demy 8vo. 15s._

  This book aims at giving an account not only of the fighting we have
  done at sea, but of the growth of the service, of the part the Navy
  has played in the development of the Empire, and of its inner life.
  The author has endeavoured to avoid the mistake of sacrificing the
  earlier periods of naval history--the very interesting wars with
  Holland in the seventeenth century, for instance, or the American War
  of 1779-1783--to the later struggle with Revolutionary and Imperial
  France.


                            COL. COOPER KING

THE STORY OF THE BRITISH ARMY. By Lieut.-Colonel Cooper King, of the
Staff College, Camberley. Illustrated. _Demy 8vo. 7s. 6d._

  This volume aims at describing the nature of the different armies that
  have been formed in Great Britain, and how from the early and feudal
  levies the present standing army came to be. The changes in tactics,
  uniform, and armament are briefly touched upon, and the campaigns in
  which the army has shared have been so far followed as to explain the
  part played by British regiments in them.

  This little book is the first volume of a new Devotional Series, the
  volumes of which will be edited by competent scholars, printed in
  clear type, and published at a very low price.

  This volume contains the nine books of the 'Confessions,' which are
  suitable for devotional purposes. The name of the Editor is a
  sufficient guarantee of the excellence of the edition.

  English Amateur Championships, Oxford and Cambridge Boat-race, etc.
  etc.) will be found in an Appendix.

                          E. C. MARCHANT, M.A.
OF TRINITY COLLEGE, OXFORD; FELLOW OF PETERHOUSE, CAMBRIDGE; ST. PAUL's
                            SCHOOL, LONDON.

Messrs. Methuen propose to issue a new series of Classical Texts, edited
by eminent scholars, for the use of English-speaking students. The books
will be well printed and bound, and will be published at a very low
price. The first volume of every author will contain a brief
Introduction in English, not exceeding eight pages, in which the
necessary information about the MSS. will be given, and the salient
features of the author's style indicated.

The critical notes, which will be at the foot of the page, will exhibit
only the important MS. variants and conjectures of special value. They
will contain very little argument; and there will be no explanatory
notes. Every volume of the series will contain a short _Index Rerum et
Nominum_.

Special attention will be paid to the typography of the series.

Messrs. Methuen propose to issue a series of texts of Byzantine
Historians, edited by English and foreign scholars. It will consist
mainly of Greek texts, but will also include English translations of
some Oriental works which are important sources for Byzantine history.
The Greek texts, which will be in all cases based on original study of
MSS., will be accompanied by brief critical notes, and preceded by short
introductions, containing the necessary explanations as to the material
which has been used for the determination of the text. A special feature
of these volumes will be very full _indices Graecitatis_, framed with a
view to the collection of material for the _Lexicon totius Graecitatis_
of the future. Each volume will of course also be provided with an
_Index Rerum et Nominum_.

The collaboration of a considerable number of eminent foreign scholars
has been secured; so that this series can justly claim to be regarded as
international.

Crown 8vo. Buckram, gilt top. 6s._

  which Mr. Kipling has built the whole of his work.'--_Times._

  'Full of passionate patriotism and the Imperial spirit.'--_Yorkshire
  Post._

  'The Empire has found a singer; it is no depreciation of the songs to
  say that statesmen may have, one way or other, to take account of
  them.'--_Manchester Guardian._

  'Animated through and through with indubitable genius.'--_Daily
  Telegraph._

  'Packed with inspiration, with humour, with pathos.'--_Daily
  Chronicle._

  'All the pride of empire, all the intoxication of power, all the
  ardour, the energy, the masterful strength and the wonderful endurance
  and death-scorning pluck which are the very bone and fibre and marrow
  of the British character are here.'--_Daily Mail._

Rudyard Kipling. BARRACK-ROOM BALLADS; And Other Verses. By Rudyard
Kipling. _Tenth Edition. Crown 8vo. 6s._

  'Mr. Kipling's verse is strong, vivid, full of character....
  Unmistakable genius rings in every line.'--_Times._

  'The ballads teem with imagination, they palpitate with emotion. We
  read them with laughter and tears; the metres throb in our pulses, the
  cunningly ordered words tingle with life; and if this be not poetry,
  what is?'--_Pall Mall Gazette._

"Q." POEMS AND BALLADS. By "Q.," Author of 'Green Bays,' etc. _Crown
8vo. Buckram. 3s. 6d._

8vo. 3s. 6d._

  'An attractive and catholic selection.'--_Times._

  'It is edited by the most original and most accomplished of modern
  Irish poets, and against his editing but a single objection can be
  brought, namely, that it excludes from the collection his own delicate
  lyrics.'--_Saturday Review._

E. Mackay. A SONG OF THE SEA: My Lady of Dreams, and other Poems. By
Eric Mackay, Author of 'The Love Letters of a Violinist.' _Second
Edition. Fcap. 8vo, gilt top. 5s._

  sonorous.'--_Globe._

Ibsen. BRAND. A Drama by Henrik Ibsen. Translated by William Wilson.
_Second Edition. Crown 8vo. 3s. 6d._

  'The greatest world-poem of the nineteenth century next to "Faust." It

  Chronicle._

Courage, and Constancy, from the Earliest Times to the Present Day.
Edited, with Notes, by Rev. F. Langbridge. _Crown 8vo. Buckram. 3s. 6d.

  'Among the editions in one volume, Mr. Andrew Lang's will take the
  place of authority.'--_Times._

  'To the general public the beauty of its type, and the fair
  proportions of its pages, as well as the excellent chronological
  arrangement of the poems, should make it acceptable enough.  Mr. Lang
  and his publishers have certainly succeeded in producing an attractive
  popular edition of the poet, in which the brightly written
  biographical introduction is not the least notable feature.'--_Glasgow
  Herald._

  'Very dainty volumes are these; the paper, type, and light-green
  binding are all very agreeable to the eye. _Simplex munditiis_ is the
  phrase that might be applied to them.'--_Globe._

  'The volumes are strongly bound in green buckram, are of a convenient
  size, and pleasant to look upon, so that whether on the shelf, or on
  the table, or in the hand the possessor is thoroughly content with
  them.'--_Guardian._

numerous illustrations and initial letters by Arthur J. Gaskin. _Second
Edition. Crown 8vo. Buckram. 6s._

  'Mr. Baring Gould is deserving of gratitude, in re-writing in honest,
  simple style the old stories that delighted the childhood of "our
  fathers and grandfathers." As to the form of the book, and the
  printing, which is by Messrs. Constable, it were difficult to commend
  overmuch.'--_Saturday Review._

  to the number of 77, game-rhymes, and jingles. To the student we
  commend the sensible introduction, and the explanatory notes. The

M.A., and Illustrated by Walter Crane. _Crown 8vo, gilt top. 5s._

  are here printed for the first time.

  'An anthology which, from its unity of aim and high poetic excellence,
  has a better right to exist than most of its fellows.'--_Guardian._

  printed.'--_Times._

  'The edition is edited as a classic should be edited, removing
  nothing, yet indicating the value of the text, and bringing it up to
  date. It promises to be of the utmost value, and will be a welcome
  addition to many libraries.'--_Scotsman._

  'This edition, so far as one may judge from the first instalment, is a
  marvel of erudition and critical skill, and it is the very minimum of
  praise to predict that the seven volumes of it will supersede Dean
  Milman's as the standard edition of our great historical
  classic.'--_Glasgow Herald._

  'The beau-ideal Gibbon has arrived at last.'--_Sketch._

  'At last there is an adequate modern edition of Gibbon.... The best

  accomplished student of comparative archaeology. In these lectures,

Edition. Royal 8vo. 15s._

  'A most splendid and fascinating book on a subject of undying
  interest. The great feature of the book is the use the author has made

  subtlety he has exhibited in dealing with this line of research. It is
  brilliantly written, and the illustrations are supplied on a scale of
  profuse magnificence.'--_Daily Chronicle._

  'The volumes will in no sense disappoint the general reader. Indeed,
  in their way, there is nothing in any sense so good in English.... Mr.
  Baring Gould has presented his narrative in such a way as not to make
  one dull page.'--_Athenaeum._

With over 450 Illustrations in the Text and 13 Photogravure Plates.
_Large quarto. Gilt top. 36s._

  'A brilliant and attractive volume. It impresses first by reason of
  its bulk, and next by reason of its substantial and striking binding.
  Within, it is remarkable, to begin with, for the considerable number
  and unusual excellence of its illustrations. Never before, it is safe
  to say, have so many pictures relating to Napoleon been brought
  together within the limits of an English book. The portraits alone are
  multitudinous; Bonaparte is presented to us at all ages, in all sorts
  of costume, and amid very varied circumstances. Then there are
  reproductions of statuettes, busts, and medals, caricatures, portraits
  of his connections by birth and marriage, representations of events in
  which he took part, and what not. The list of illustrations in the
  text covers nine pages, and in addition there are a dozen full-page
  photogravures, in which famous paintings are reproduced. Altogether,
  this is a table-book of the first class. But it is more. It embodies
  "a study of the character and opinions of Napoleon" on which Mr.
  Baring Gould can be freely congratulated. The writer's plan has been
  to "lay on one side what concerned Napoleon's military achievements
  and the political importance of his life, so far as did not bear on
  the development of his mind and the movements of his heart." By this
  means a novel point of view has been secured, and the result is a
  narrative of which the chief characteristic is an agreeable
  freshness.'--_Globe._

R. L. Stevenson. VAILIMA LETTERS. By Robert Louis Stevenson. With an
Etched Portrait by William Strang, and other Illustrations. _Second
Edition. Crown 8vo. Buckram. 7s. 6d._

  'The Vailima Letters are rich in all the varieties of that charm which
  have secured for Stevenson the affection of many others besides
  "journalists, fellow-novelists, and boys."'--_The Times._

  'Few publications have in our time been more eagerly awaited than
  these "Vailima Letters," giving the first fruits of the correspondence
  of Robert Louis Stevenson. But, high as the tide of expectation has
  run, no reader can possibly be disappointed in the result.'--_St.
  James's Gazette._

  'For the student of English literature these letters indeed are a
  treasure. They are more like "Scott's Journal" in kind than any other

Victor Hugo. THE LETTERS OF VICTOR HUGO. Translated from the French by
F. Clarke, M.A. _In Two Volumes. Demy 8vo. 10s. 6d. each. Vol. I.
1815-35._

  This is the first volume of one of the most interesting and important
  collection of letters ever published in France. The correspondence
  dates from Victor Hugo's boyhood to his death, and none of the letters
  have been published before. The arrangement is chiefly chronological,
  but where there is an interesting set of letters to one person these
  are arranged together. The first volume contains, among others, (1)
  Letters to his father; (2) to his young wife; (3) to his confessor,
  Lamennais; (4) a very important set of about fifty letters to
  Sainte-Beuve; (5) letters about his early books and plays.

  'A charming and vivid picture of a man whose egotism never marred his
  natural kindness, and whose vanity did not impair his
  greatness.'--_Standard._

7s. 6d._

  This work gives for the first time in moderate compass a complete
  portrait of St. Anselm, exhibiting him in his intimate and interior as
  well as in his public life. Thus, while the great
  ecclesiastico-political struggle in which he played so prominent a
  part is fully dealt with, unusual prominence is given to the profound
  and subtle speculations by which he permanently influenced theological
  and metaphysical thought; while it will be a surprise to most readers
  to find him also appearing as the author of some of the most exquisite
  religious poetry in the Latin language.

  'Mr. Rigg has told the story of the great Primate's life with
  scholarly ability, and has thereby contributed an interesting chapter

BARABBAS: A DREAM OF THE WORLD'S TRAGEDY. _Twenty-ninth Edition._

  'The tender reverence of the treatment and the imaginative beauty of
  the writing have reconciled us to the daring of the conception, and
  the conviction is forced on us that even so exalted a subject cannot
  be made too familiar to us, provided it be presented in the true
  spirit of Christian faith. The amplifications of the Scripture
  narrative are often conceived with high poetic insight, and this
  "Dream of the World's Tragedy" is, despite some trifling
  incongruities, a lofty and not inadequate paraphrase of the supreme
  climax of the inspired narrative.'--_Dublin Review._

THE SORROWS OF SATAN. _Thirty-fourth Edition._

  'A very powerful piece of work.... The conception is magnificent, and
  is likely to win an abiding place within the memory of man.... The
  author has immense command of language, and a limitless audacity....
  This interesting and remarkable romance will live long after much of
  the ephemeral literature of the day is forgotten.... A literary
  phenomenon ... novel, and even sublime.'--W. T. Stead in the _Review
  of Reviews_.


                         Anthony Hope's Novels

                         _Crown 8vo. 6s. each._

THE GOD IN THE CAR. _Seventh Edition._

  'A very remarkable book, deserving of critical analysis impossible
  within our limit; brilliant, but not superficial; well considered, but
  not elaborated; constructed with the proverbial art that conceals, but
  yet allows itself to be enjoyed by readers to whom fine literary
  method is a keen pleasure.'--_The World._

A CHANGE OF AIR. _Fourth Edition._

  'A graceful, vivacious comedy, true to human nature. The characters
  are traced with a masterly hand.'--_Times._

A MAN OF MARK. _Fourth Edition._

  'Of all Mr. Hope's books, "A Man of Mark" is the one which best
  compares with "The Prisoner of Zenda."'--_National Observer._

THE CHRONICLES OF COUNT ANTONIO. _Third Edition._

  'It is a perfectly enchanting story of love and chivalry, and pure
  romance. The outlawed Count is the most constant, desperate, and
  withal modest and tender of lovers, a peerless gentleman, an intrepid
  fighter, a very faithful friend, and a most magnanimous
  foe.'--_Guardian._


                        S. Baring Gould's Novels

                         _Crown 8vo. 6s. each._

  'To say that a book is by the author of "Mehalah" is to imply that it
  contains a story cast on strong lines, containing dramatic
  possibilities, vivid and sympathetic descriptions of Nature, and a
  wealth of ingenious imagery.'--_Speaker._

  'That whatever Mr. Baring Gould writes is well worth reading, is a
  conclusion that may be very generally accepted. His views of life are
  fresh and vigorous, his language pointed and characteristic, the
  incidents of which he makes use are striking and original, his
  characters are life-like, and though somewhat exceptional people, are
  drawn and coloured with artistic force. Add to this that his
  descriptions of scenes and scenery are painted with the loving eyes
  and skilled hands of a master of his art, that he is always fresh and
  never dull, and under such conditions it is no wonder that readers
  have gained confidence both in his power of amusing and satisfying
  them, and that year by year his popularity widens.'--_Court Circular._

ARMINELL: A Social Romance. _Fourth Edition._

URITH: A Story of Dartmoor. _Fifth Edition._

THE QUEEN OF LOVE. _Fourth Edition._

  'You cannot put it down until you have finished it.'--_Punch._

  'Can be heartily recommended to all who care for cleanly, energetic,
  and interesting fiction.'--_Sussex Daily News._

KITTY ALONE. _Fourth Edition._

  'A strong and original story, teeming with graphic description,
  stirring incident, and, above all, with vivid and enthralling human
  interest.'--_Daily Telegraph._

NOEMI: A Romance of the Cave-Dwellers. Illustrated by R. Caton
Woodville. _Third Edition._

  '"Noemi" is as excellent a tale of fighting and adventure as one may
  wish to meet. The narrative also runs clear and sharp as the Loire
  itself.'--_Pall Mall Gazette._

  'Mr. Baring Gould's powerful story is full of the strong lights and
  shadows and vivid colouring to which he has accustomed
  us.'--_Standard._

THE BROOM-SQUIRE. Illustrated by Frank Dadd. _Fourth Edition._

  'A strain of tenderness is woven through the web of his tragic tale,
  and its atmosphere is sweetened by the nobility and sweetness of the
  heroine's character.'--_Daily News._

  'A story of exceptional interest that seems to us to be better than
  anything he has written of late.'--_Speaker._

THE PENNYCOMEQUICKS. _New Edition._

DARTMOOR IDYLLS.

  'A book to read, and keep and read again; for the genuine fun and
  pathos of it will not early lose their effect.'--_Vanity Fair._

  genius in Mr. Parker's style.'--_Daily Telegraph._

MRS. FALCHION. _Fourth Edition._

  'A splendid study of character.'--_Athenaeum._

  'But little behind anything that has been done by any writer of our
  time.'--_Pall Mall Gazette._

  'A very striking and admirable novel.'--_St. James's Gazette._

THE TRANSLATION OF A SAVAGE.

  'The plot is original and one difficult to work out; but Mr. Parker
  has done it with great skill and delicacy. The reader who is not
  interested in this original, fresh, and well-told tale must be a dull
  person indeed.'--_Daily Chronicle._

THE TRAIL OF THE SWORD. _Fourth Edition._

  'Everybody with a soul for romance will thoroughly enjoy "The Trail of
  the Sword."'--_St. James's Gazette._

  'A rousing and dramatic tale. A book like this, in which swords flash,
  great surprises are undertaken, and daring deeds done, in which men
  and women live and love in the old straightforward passionate way, is
  a joy inexpressible to the reviewer.'--_Daily Chronicle._

WHEN VALMOND CAME TO PONTIAC: The Story of a Lost Napoleon. _Fourth
Edition._

  'Here we find romance--real, breathing, living romance, but it runs
  flush with our own times, level with our own feelings. The character
  of Valmond is drawn unerringly; his career, brief as it is, is placed
  before us as convincingly as history itself. The book must be read, we
  may say re-read, for any one thoroughly to appreciate Mr. Parker's
  delicate touch and innate sympathy with humanity.'--_Pall Mall
  Gazette._

  'The one work of genius which 1895 has as yet produced.'--_New Age._

AN ADVENTURER OF THE NORTH: The Last Adventures of 'Pretty Pierre.'
_Second Edition._

  'The present book is full of fine and moving stories of the great
  North, and it will add to Mr. Parker's already high
  reputation.'--_Glasgow Herald._

THE SEATS OF THE MIGHTY. _Illustrated. Sixth Edition._

  'The best thing he has done; one of the best things that any one has
  done lately.'--_St. James's Gazette._

  'Mr. Parker seems to become stronger and easier with every serious
  novel that he attempts.... In "The Seats of the Mighty" he shows the
  matured power which his former novels have led us to expect, and has
  produced a really fine historical novel.... Most sincerely is Mr.
  Parker to be congratulated on the finest novel he has yet
  written.'--_Athenaeum._

  'Mr. Parker's latest book places him in the front rank of living
  novelists. "The Seats of the Mighty" is a great book.'--_Black and
  White._

  'One of the strongest stories of historical interest and adventure
  that we have read for many a day.... A notable and successful
  book.'--_Speaker._

  'An admirable romance. The glory of a romance is its plot, and this
  plot is crowded with fine sensations, which have no rest until the
  fall of the famous old city and the final restitution of love.'--_Pall
  Mall Gazette._

Conan Doyle. ROUND THE RED LAMP. By A. Conan Doyle, Author of 'The White
Company,' 'The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,' etc. _Fourth Edition.
Crown 8vo. 6s._

  'The book is, indeed, composed of leaves from life, and is far and
  away the best view that has been vouchsafed us behind the scenes of
  the consulting-room. It is very superior to "The Diary of a late
  Physician."'--_Illustrated London News._

Stanley Weyman. UNDER THE RED ROBE. By Stanley Weyman, Author of 'A
Gentleman of France.' With Twelve Illustrations by R. Caton Woodville.
_Eleventh Edition. Crown 8vo. 6s._

  'A book of which we have read every word for the sheer pleasure of
  reading, and which we put down with a pang that we cannot forget it
  all and start again.'--_Westminster Gazette._

  'Every one who reads books at all must read this thrilling romance,
  from the first page of which to the last the breathless reader is
  haled along. An inspiration of "manliness and courage."'--_Daily
  Chronicle._

  'A delightful tale of chivalry and adventure, vivid and
  dramatic.'--_Globe._

Lucas Malet. THE CARISSIMA. By Lucas Malet, Author of 'The Wages of
Sin,' etc. _Third Edition. Crown 8vo. 6s._

  This is the first novel which Lucas Malet has written since her very
  powerful 'The Wages of Sin.'

  well.'--_Sketch._

'Aunt Anne,' etc. _Second Edition. Crown 8vo. 6s._

  'The story is a very sad and a very beautiful one, exquisitely told,
  and enriched with many subtle touches of wise and tender insight. It
  will, undoubtedly, add to its author's reputation--already high--in
  the ranks of novelists.'--_Speaker._

Emily Lawless. HURRISH. By the Honble. Emily Lawless, Author of
'Maelcho,' etc. _Fifth Edition. Crown 8vo. 6s._

Crown 8vo. 6s._

  'A really great book.'--_Spectator._

  'There is no keener pleasure in life than the recognition of genius.
  Good work is commoner than it used to be, but the best is as rare as
  ever. All the more gladly, therefore, do we welcome in "Maelcho" a
  piece of work of the first order, which we do not hesitate to describe
  as one of the most remarkable literary achievements of this
  generation. Miss Lawless is possessed of the very essence of
  historical genius.'--_Manchester Guardian._

M. M. Dowie. GALLIA. By Menie Muriel Dowie, Author of 'A Girl in the
Carpathians.' _Third Edition. Crown 8vo. 6s._

  'The style is generally admirable, the dialogue not seldom brilliant,
  the situations surprising in their freshness and originality, while
  the subsidiary as well as the principal characters live and move, and
  the story itself is readable from title-page to colophon.'--_Saturday
  Review._

Mrs. Oliphant. SIR ROBERT'S FORTUNE. By Mrs. Oliphant. _Crown 8vo. 6s._

  'Full of her own peculiar charm of style and simple, subtle
  character-painting comes her new gift, the delightful story before us.
  The scene mostly lies in the moors, and at the touch of the authoress
  a Scotch moor becomes a living thing, strong, tender, beautiful, and
  changeful.'--_Pall Mall Gazette._

Mrs. Oliphant. THE TWO MARYS. By Mrs. Oliphant. _Second Edition. Crown
8vo. 6s._

W. E. Norris. HIS GRACE. By W. E. Norris. _Third Edition. Crown 8vo.
6s._

  Hurstbourne, at once unconventional and very true to the
  conventionalities of life.'--_Athenaeum._

W. E. Norris. THE DESPOTIC LADY AND OTHERS. By W. E. Norris. _Crown 8vo.
6s._

  companions.'--_Daily Telegraph._

H. G. Wells. THE STOLEN BACILLUS, and other Stories. By H. G. Wells,
Author of 'The Time Machine.' _Crown 8vo. 6s._

  'The ordinary reader of fiction may be glad to know that these stories
  are eminently readable from one cover to the other, but they are more
  than that; they are the impressions of a very striking imagination,
  which, it would seem, has a great deal within its reach.'--_Saturday
  Review._

Arthur Morrison. TALES OF MEAN STREETS. By Arthur Morrison. _Fourth
Edition. Crown 8vo. 6s._

  'Told with consummate art and extraordinary detail. He tells a plain,
  unvarnished tale, and the very truth of it makes for beauty. In the
  true humanity of the book lies its justification, the permanence of
  its interest, and its indubitable triumph.'--_Athenaeum._

  'A great book. The author's method is amazingly effective, and
  produces a thrilling sense of reality. The writer lays upon us a
  master hand. The book is simply appalling and irresistible in its
  interest. It is humorous also; without humour it would not make the
  mark it is certain to make.'--_World._

Arthur Morrison. A CHILD OF THE JAGO. By Arthur Morrison, Author of
'Tales of Mean Streets.' _Second Edition. Crown 8vo. 6s._

  This, the first long story which Mr. Morrison has written, is like his
  remarkable 'Tales of Mean Streets,' a realistic study of East End
  life.

  'The book is a masterpiece.'--_Pall Mall Gazette._

  'Told with great vigour and powerful simplicity.'--_Athenaeum._

J. Maclaren Cobban. THE KING OF ANDAMAN: A Saviour of Society. By J.
Maclaren Cobban. _Crown 8vo. 6s._

  'An unquestionably interesting book. It would not surprise us if it
  turns out to be the most interesting novel of the season, for it
  contains one character, at least, who has in him the root of
  immortality, and the book itself is ever exhaling the sweet savour of
  the unexpected.... Plot is forgotten and incident fades, and only the
  really human endures, and throughout this book there stands out in
  bold and beautiful relief its high-souled and chivalric protagonist,
  James the Master of Hutcheon, the King of Andaman himself.'--_Pall
  Mall Gazette._

H. Morrah. A SERIOUS COMEDY. By Herbert Morrah. _Crown 8vo. 6s._

Smith,' etc. _Second Edition. Crown 8vo. 6s._

  liking for the two simple people who are the successors to the title
  mounts steadily, and ends almost in respect.'--_Scotsman._

T. L. Paton. A HOME IN INVERESK. By T. L. Paton. _Crown 8vo. 6s._

  'A book which bears marks of considerable promise.'--_Scotsman._

  'A pleasant and well-written story.'--_Daily Chronicle._

John Davidson. MISS ARMSTRONG'S AND OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES. By John
Davidson. _Crown 8vo. 6s._

  'Throughout the volume there is a strong vein of originality, a
  strength in the handling, and a knowledge of human nature that are
  worthy of the highest praise.'--_Scotsman._

J. A. Barry. IN THE GREAT DEEP: Tales of the Sea. By J. A. Barry. Author
of 'Steve Brown's Bunyip.' _Crown 8vo. 6s._

of 'The Hispaniola Plate.' _Second Edition. Crown 8vo. 6s._

  denote the true artist.'--_Broad Arrow._

H. Johnston. DR. CONGALTON'S LEGACY. By Henry Johnston. _Crown 8vo. 6s._

  'The story is redolent of humour, pathos, and tenderness, while it is
  not without a touch of tragedy.'--_Scotsman._

  'A worthy and permanent contribution to Scottish creative
  literature.'--_Glasgow Herald._

Julian Corbett. A BUSINESS IN GREAT WATERS. By Julian Corbett, Author of
'Forgotten Gold,' 'Kophetua XIII,' etc. _Crown 8vo. 6s._

  'Mr. Corbett writes with immense spirit, and the book is a thoroughly
  enjoyable one in all respects. The salt of the ocean is in it, and the
  right heroic ring resounds through its gallant
  adventures.'--_Speaker._

Cornford. _Illustrated. Crown 8vo. 6s._

Daintrey. _Crown 8vo. 6s._

  'Miss Daintrey seems to have an intimate acquaintance with the people
  and politics of the Balkan countries in which the scene of her lively
  and picturesque romance is laid. On almost every page we find clever
  touches of local colour which differentiate her book unmistakably from
  the ordinary novel.'--_Glasgow Herald._

M. A. Owen. THE DAUGHTER OF ALOUETTE. By Mary A. Owen. _Crown 8vo. 6s._

  A story of life among the American Indians.

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
