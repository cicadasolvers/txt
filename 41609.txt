GENTLEMEN,

When you did me the honour to appoint me President of your most useful
Society as the successor of the Marquess Camden, I felt anxious to
express my sense of that honour by some appropriate acknowledgment.

I at first thought of printing a MS. from my own library, but, not
finding one that seemed exactly suitable, in my difficulty I applied to
my old and valued friend Mr. Bruce, and he pointed out to me
Manningham's Diary in the British Museum as possessing a varied interest
in the literary world which was likely to commend it to your notice. I
willingly adopted his suggestion; and I owe to him my sincere
acknowledgments for the pains he has bestowed in seeing the work through
the press, and in prefacing it with an interesting essay.

I have now to offer you this copy of Manningham's little book, and to
assure you how sincerely I am

Your obedient and obliged servant,

  WILLIAM TITE.
  42, Lowndes Square,
  3rd October, 1868.




PREFACE.


The original of MANNINGHAM'S DIARY, which is here printed, is No. 5353
in the Harleian collection of MSS. in the British Museum. It is a
diminutive 12mo. volume, measuring not quite six inches by four, and
containing 133 leaves. The handwriting, of which an admirable
representation is given in the fac-simile prefixed, is small, and in the
main extremely legible; yet in some few places, from haste in the
writer, from corrections, from blotting, from the effects of time, and
from other obvious causes, difficulties have occurred in a word or two,
which, even with the assistance of gentlemen most skilful in reading the
old hands, have not been entirely overcome. The few instances in which
the collater has been baffled are indicated by marks of doubt.

The first historical writer who noticed this little volume for a
literary purpose was Mr. John Payne Collier. In his Annals of the Stage,
published in 1831 (i. 320), Mr. Collier quoted from this Diary various
passages connected with his special subject, and drew attention to the
principal personal facts disclosed by the writer respecting himself,
namely, that he had many relations in Kent, and had probably been a
member of the Middle Temple.

The late Mr. Joseph Hunter was the next writer who used the work for an
historical purpose.[1] With his well-known fondness for genealogical
inquiries he applied himself to determine who the writer was whom Mr.
Collier had designated merely as a barrister. In this inquiry Mr. Hunter
was completely successful. Pursuing the clue given by the mention of
relationships in Kent in the various ways which would occur to a person
skilled in such investigations, Mr. Hunter fell upon a track in which
coincidences between the facts stated in the MS. and those elicited by
his own researches followed one another so rapidly as in the end to
leave not even the shadow of a doubt that the desired result had been
obtained.

    [Footnote 1: See his Illustrations of Shakespeare, i. 365.]

We shall briefly indicate the course by which Mr. Hunter arrived at his
conclusions. It looks easy enough after the end has been attained, but
it will be borne in mind that inquiries of this kind are extremely
discursive. The statement of a few leading facts upon the establishment
of which the final conclusion is arrived at, gives no idea of the time
lost in investigations which are merely tentative. In all such inquiries
we are soon reminded of the pretty passages which, after turnings and
windings almost _ad libitum_, are ultimately found to lead to nothing.

Besides cousins of at least seven different names who are alluded to by
the Diarist, several of them in connection with Canterbury, Sandwich,
and Godmersham, there is one whom he specially commemorates as "my
cousin in Kent" (p. 19), and whom he frequently vouches by that
designation, or merely as his cousin, as his authority for information
which he chronicles. This cousin was evidently the writer's most
important connection--the great man of the family. To visit him and his
somewhat wayward second wife was the principal object of the Diarist's
journeys into Kent. It also appears that this cousin was a man advanced
in life,--roughly stated to be 62 years of age in March 1602-3, and that
he resided at a place called Bradbourne, in the neighbourhood of
Maidstone. This last fact led directly to the identification desired.

Bradbourne was easily found. It has been for centuries a family seat in
the parish of East Malling. Hasted has represented the house in one of
his pictorial illustrations pretty much as it yet exists. It has been
shorn indeed of many of the noble trees, of the deer, and of some of the
other aristocratic adornments with which the county historian surrounded
it, but it still stands a stately old-fashioned red-brick mansion,
probably of the date of the reign of Queen Anne. Long before that period
the same spot was occupied by a previous residence of a county family.
From the time of the Protectorate it has belonged to a branch of the old
Kentish stock, the Twysdens; and before they purchased it--"in the reign
of Queen Elizabeth," as Hasted remarks[2]--"it was in the possession of
a family named Manningham."--Manningham! Our diarist slightly alludes to
a cousin of that name, "G. Manningham, deceased."[3] The clue was vague,
but at that little chink there entered light sufficient to guide the
researches of an antiquary.

    [Footnote 2: Vol. ii. p. 215, ed. 1782.]

    [Footnote 3: P. 108.]

The inscriptions on the older monuments in East Malling church are
printed in Thorpe's _Registrum Roffense_.[4] To them Mr. Hunter had
recourse, and with good success. Amongst them he found one upon a
monument[5] still standing on the north side of the chancel of the
church to a Richard Manningham, evidently a person of importance in that
neighbourhood. It is not stated in the inscription that he was the
owner of Bradbourne, but he lived at the time when our author paid his
visits thither, and his age, as given on the monument, although not
coincident with that stated by the Diarist,--for the monument declares
that Richard Manningham died on the 25th April, 1611, in his 72nd
year,--was sufficiently near to stimulate to further inquiries. But
without following Mr. Hunter step by step it will be enough to state
that from the inscription he went to Doctors' Commons, where, under the
vicious system of mismanagement which then prevailed, he was one of the
favoured two or three who were permitted to use the testamentary
records, whilst all other inquirers were excluded with a most offensive
disregard of courtesy. The will of Richard Manningham helped on the
inquiry very considerably. It was further advanced by an heraldic
Visitation of Kent, and was finally and triumphantly concluded by an
inspection of the register-books of the Middle Temple.

    [Footnote 4: Lond. 1769, fol. p. 793.]

    [Footnote 5: The inscription is surmounted by a bust of singular
    coarseness, evidently the work of some country sculptor, and
    executed in the worst taste and manner.]

Without derogating in the slightest degree from the merit of Mr.
Hunter's investigations, or desiring to deprive his memory of one atom
of the credit which attaches to it on that account, we prefer to state
the facts respecting the Manninghams in words of our own, which will
enable us to weave into the narrative some additions to the results of
Mr. Hunter's inquiries.

About the middle of the sixteenth century the Manninghams were a
numerous family of the middle class,[6] branches of which were scattered
about in various parts of England. The Richard Manningham of the
monument at East Malling was born at St. Alban's; Robert Manningham,
descended from a stock which removed out of Bedfordshire into
Cambridgeshire, lived and died at Fen Drayton in that county; George
Manningham dwelt in Kent, and from the marriages of his female
descendants in that county there probably sprang the numerous cousinred
of the family to which we have already alluded. Their _status_ in Kent
before Richard Manningham settled at Bradbourne may be inferred from one
fact which appears in the Diary, namely, that George Manningham was
bound as surety with William Somner, father of the well known antiquary
of Canterbury, for the father's performance of the duties of the
registrarship of the Ecclesiastical Court, in which office he preceded
his son.

    [Footnote 6: "_Honesta natus familia_" are the words of the
    inscription to Richard Manningham, the very words used also as
    descriptive of the descent of Sir Thomas More on his monument in
    Chelsea church; _familia non celebri sed honesta natus_. (Faulkner's
    Chelsea, i. 207.)]

Richard, Robert, and George Manningham are all stated to have been
relations, and probably they all stood about upon a par in worldly
circumstances, but Richard pursued a way of life which enabled him to
shoot ahead of all the members of his family. Of his youth we have no
particulars, but he was well educated even according to present notions.
He united an acquaintance with modern languages to the share of
classical knowledge taught in our old grammar-schools, and is
commemorated as having spoken and written Latin, French, and Dutch, with
freedom and elegance, and as having been able at the age of sixty-two to
repeat _memoriter_ almost the whole of the first and second books of the
AEneid.

Brought up to some branch of commerce, he was a member of the Mercers'
Company of London, and in his business days resided in the metropolis,
but age found him with a competency, and brought with it some customary
infirmities. He retired from London, purchased the quiet sheltered
Bradbourne, and passed the evening of his days in occupations in which
literature bore a considerable share.

He was twice married; the first time to a native of Holland, a family
connection of the Lady Palavicini, afterwards wife of Sir Oliver
Cromwell, the uncle of the future Protector.[7] This marriage was a
happy one. The lady survived the purchase of Bradbourne,[8] and was
buried in the church of East Malling. Richard Manningham's second match
was with a Kentish widow. The traces we find of her in the Diary do not
leave an impression that she added much to her husband's happiness. She
is not alluded to in his will. We may therefore conclude that she died
between 1602 and 1611.[9] There is no mention of issue by either
marriage.

    [Footnote 7: Diary, pp. 49, 51.]

    [Footnote 8: The last notice we have of her is under the date of
    1595, when her husband, "at her request and for her sake," lent her
    kinsmen, Arnold Verbeck, Abraham Verbeck, and Goris Besselles,
    merchant-strangers, 400_l._ which remained due with all interest
    upon it up to the 21st January 1611-12, the date of his will. He
    forgave his debtors the amount, provided they paid 40_l._ a piece to
    Margarita and Susanna Verbeck, daughters of Arnold, and to the
    testator's niece Janeken Vermeren, daughter of his first wife's
    sister, within twelve months after his decease.]

    [Footnote 9: The registers of East Malling do not begin until 1640.
    We beg warmly to acknowledge our obligations to the Rev. W. L.
    Wigan, the rector, who in the kindest manner searched from 1640 to
    1660 for entries relating to the Manninghams, but without finding
    anything about them.]

Childless, solitary, and infirm, Richard Manningham was in no degree
misanthropic. Out of his abundance he applied considerable sums in
charity, and for the benefit of his kindred, and at an early period
looked around for a Manningham who might inherit the principal portion
of his property and carry on his name. His choice fell upon John
Manningham, a son of Robert of Fen Drayton, and his wife Joan, a
daughter of John Fisher of Bledlow in the county of Bedford. That person
is our Diarist.

Richard Manningham carried out the obligations of this adoption in the
most liberal way. It is obvious from the Diary that John Manningham,
whom Richard Manningham designated by the several titles of "cousin,"
"kinsman," and "son in love," received a generous education of the best
kind. He was intended for the practice of the law, and on the 16th
March, 1597-8, was entered of the Middle Temple, as the son and heir of
Robert Manningham of Fen Drayton, gentleman, deceased. John Chapman,
probably the same person who is mentioned in the Diary as one of the
cousins who lived at Godmersham,[10] and John Hoskyns, were the members
of the Inn who were his sureties upon his admission.

    [Footnote 10: Diary, pp. 108, 111.]

On the 7th June 1605, having kept his exercises and been on the books
for the needful seven years, he was called to the degree of an utter
barrister; whether afterwards advanced to the dignity of being permitted
to plead in actual causes in court does not appear.

Whilst in the Temple he had for his chamber-fellow Edward Curle, son
of William Curle, a retainer of Sir Robert Cecil, who procured him to
be appointed one of the auditors of the Court of Wards. Several
persons of this family are quoted in the Diary, and the close
relationship of chamber-fellow ripened not merely into lasting
friendship with Edward Curle, and with his brother Walter, who
afterwards became Bishop of Winchester, but into affection towards
their sister Anne. John Manningham and Anne Curle were married
probably about 1607. A son was born to them in 1608, who was named
Richard after the _quasi_-grandfather at Bradbourne. Two other sons
were subsequently named John and Walter, and three daughters, Susanna,
Anne, and Elizabeth. Where John Manningham lived after he quitted the
Temple, whether in London with a view to practice at the Bar, at
Hatfield which was the place of residence of the Curles, or at
Bradbourne with his "father in love," then a second time a widower,
does not appear.

On the 3rd January 1609-10, the old merchant proved the reality of his
assumed fatherhood by executing a deed of gift to John Manningham of the
mansion-house of Bradbourne and the lands surrounding it in East
Malling, and two years afterwards, on the 21st January, being, as he
states, "in tolerable health of body in regard of mine age and
infirmities," he made his will. It confirmed, "if needful," the deed of
gift to John Manningham, appointed him sole executor, and with some
slight exceptions and the charge of a considerable number of legacies,
most of them tokens of remembrance, gave him all the residue of his
property. The multitude of the old man's legacies and not less so their
character tell of his continuing interest in the connections of his past
life. They read like the last utterances of a warm and affectionate
spirit casting back its glance upon those from whom it was about to
part; whilst his adjuration to his adopted son to discharge the amounts
with punctuality, although deformed by the verbiage of legal formality,
and smacking a little of the mercantile estimate of the indispensable
importance of payment on the very day, is not devoid of real solemnity.
Omitting some of the tautologous expressions it reads thus:--"I charge
John Manningham, by all the love and duty which he oweth me, for all my
love and liberality which I have always borne [to] him and his
heretofore, but chiefly in this my will, that he pay every legacy within
six months after my death, those excepted that are appointed to be paid
at certain days, and those to be duly paid at their days appointed, as
my trust is in him, and as he will answer afore God and me at the latter
day!" Nor is the pious close of the document without a share of true
impressiveness:--"Having thus, I thank God, finished my will, and set an
order in my worldly affairs, I will henceforward await God's will to
depart hence in peace, most humbly beseeching him that when the day of
my dissolution shall be come, I may by his grace be armed with a true
and lively faith, firm hope, and constant patience, and be ready to
forsake all to go to my blessed Saviour and Redeemer Jesus Christ. Amen,
good Lord!"

He had not long to wait. His will was dated, as we have remarked, on the
21st January, 1611-12. On the 25th of the following April,[11] Richard
Manningham entered into his rest, and John Manningham into possession
as adopted heir. On the following 1st of May he proved the will of his
"father in love" at Doctors' Commons.

    [Footnote 11: The year 1611, given on the monument as that of the
    death, is contradicted by the date of the will and other
    circumstances. It should have been 1612.]

The few particulars we have been able to gather of the course of this
family after the death of Richard Manningham are little more than a
brief register of dates. On the 16th April 1617, William Curle the
father died. He was interred in Hatfield church, where a monument
commemorates his fidelity as a public officer, his good-fortune in his
children and friends, and his calm and happy death.[12]

    [Footnote 12: "_Vera fide Christiana_" are the words of the epitaph,
    which were deemed an authority by the Index-maker for Clutterbuck's
    Hertfordshire, ii. 370, for entering a "Christiana Curle" in his
    list of names.]

In 1619, John Philipot, York Herald, made a Visitation for Kent as
Deputy for Camden, the Clarencieux. On this occasion John Manningham
registered his arms and pedigree. It is observable that he did not
introduce into it the descent of his cousin Richard Manningham from
their common ancestor, nor even his name. If the Visitation may be
depended upon we may infer that between the time when the return was
made and the 21st January 1621-2, when John Manningham made his own
will, he lost his daughter Anne by death, and his youngest son, to whom
he gave the name of his brother-in-law Walter, was born. Before the same
day his other brother-in-law and chamber-fellow Edward Curle had also
died. The last trace we have found of him is in 1613.

In the will of John Manningham to which we have just alluded, and which
it will be observed was dated like that of his predecessor on a 21st
January, he described himself as of "East Malling, esquire," and devised
Bradbourne and all the lands derived from his "late dear cousin and
father in love" Richard Manningham, "who for ever," he remarks, "is
gratefully to be remembered by me and mine," to his widow for life and
after her decease entailed the same on his three sons in succession. He
gave to his daughter Susanna a marriage portion of 300_l._; to
Elizabeth, 250_l._; to the little Benjamin of his flock, the young
Walter, anything but a Benjamin's share of 100_l._; and to his executors
20 nobles a piece; all the rest of his personalty he divided between his
widow and his eldest son. He named as executors Dr. Walter Curle, who
had then ascended upon the ladder of preferment to the Deanery of
Lichfield, and John Manningham's cousin, Dr. William Roberts of Enfield.
The Will was proved on the 4th December, 1622, by Dr. Curle alone, Dr.
Roberts having renounced.

Two further facts bring to an end the brief glimmerings we have been
able to discover respecting the third generation of the Manninghams at
Bradbourne.

Bishop Walter Curle made his will on the 15th March 1646-7, and left to
his nephew and godson Walter Manningham a sum of 50_l._ To the boy's
mother--"my loving sister Mrs. Anne Manningham," the Bishop left "a
piece of plate of twenty ounces."[13]

    [Footnote 13: See Lansd. MS. No. 985.]

Nine years afterwards the "loving sister" had followed the Bishop into
the better land. Where she was buried does not appear, certainly not at
East Malling. Bradbourne then fell to the second Richard Manningham, who
sold it in 1656 to Mr. Justice Twysden, in whose family it still
remains. Thus drops the curtain upon the connexion of the Manninghams
with East Malling.

Other persons of the same name appear in the succeeding century, one on
the episcopal bench as Bishop of Chichester, from 1709 to 1722, and his
son Sir Richard Manningham as a distinguished physician and discoverer
of the fraud of Mary Tofts the rabbit-breeder, but their connexion with
the subjects of our inquiry does not very clearly appear.

Turn we now from the Diarist and his family to the Diary. It was written
by John Manningham whilst a student in the Middle Temple, and runs
through the year 1602 down to April in 1603, Occasionally, as we have
remarked in one of our notes, some few of the entries are out of
chronological order, either from mistake of the binder or irregularity
of the Diarist. In some cases it clearly arose from the habit of the
latter of making his entries in any part of the book where there
happened to be a vacant space. The consequences are of so little moment
that we have thought it best in printing to follow the order of the
original MS. as it now stands.

Chronological sequence is the less important as the book is scarcely
what is generally understood by a Diary. It is rather a note-book in
which the writer has jotted down from time to time his impressions of
whatever he chanced to hear, read, or see, or whatever he desired to
preserve in his memory. The result is a curious patchwork. Anecdotes,
witticisms, aphoristic expressions, gossip, rumours, extracts from
books, large notes of sermons, occasional memoranda of journeys into
Kent and Huntingdonshire, with some little personal matter of the true
Diary kind, are all thrown together into a miscellany of odds and ends.

Our Diarist could not have lived in a better place than in an Inn of
Court for the compilation of such a book. The common dinner and the
common supper, the less formal gatherings at the buttery-bar and around
the hall fire, and in the summer time the exercise taken in the pleasant
garden--an indispensable accompaniment of an Inn of Court--brought
together multitudes of the "unbaked and doughy youth of the nation,"
full of life and spirit, most of them under training for legal practice
or public business, and sparkling with all the freshness and
volatility, the exuberance and glow which distinguish the opening of
young wits. This was the very place to furnish materials for such a
note-book as we have described. Among such companions the _bon mot_ of
the bar, the scandal of the Court, the tittle-tattle of the town, were
the very _pabulum_ of their daily conversation. A witty sarcasm would
tell among students not "past the bounds of freakish youth" with
infinite effect, and it mattered little--such was the universal freedom
of language and manners in those days--how literal the expression, or to
what kind of subject it related. Perhaps even additional zest was given
to a pithy speech by its want of reserve in relation to transactions
which we have come to regard as better left untalked about. Neither was
there found any greater difficulty in writing about such matters than in
speaking of them. The line of stars which occasionally will be found
stretching across our page indicates the occurrence of passages which
principally on this ground we have deemed it unadvisable to print.

The time in which our Diarist wrote was distinguished by one event of
surpassing interest--the death of the great Queen who had ruled the
country for more than forty years. In reference to that event he
possessed peculiar opportunities of acquiring information, and what he
has told us is essentially of historical authority. His channel of
communication with the Court was Dr. Henry Parry, subsequently Bishop of
Gloucester and afterwards of Worcester, at that time one of her
Majesty's chaplains and on duty in that character at the Queen's death.
On the 23rd March 1602-3, the rumours respecting her Majesty's health
were most alarming. The public were even doubtful whether she was
actually alive. In satisfaction of his curiosity our Diarist proceeded
to the palace at Richmond, where the great business was in progress. He
found assembled there the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Lord Keeper,
and others of the highest official dignitaries. The Queen still lived,
and the ordinary daily religious services were still kept up within the
sombre palace. Dr. Parry preached before the assembled visitors, and our
Diarist was permitted to be one of the audience. The sermon was as
little connected as could be with the urgent circumstances which must
have drawn off the thoughts of his congregation, but in the preacher's
prayers both before and after his discourse he interceded for her
Majesty so fervently and pathetically, that few eyes were dry.

Service over, Manningham dined in the privy chamber with Dr. Parry and a
select clerical company, who recounted to him the particulars of the
Queen's illness; how for a fortnight she had been overwhelmed with
melancholy, sitting for hours with eyes fixed upon one object, unable to
sleep, refusing food and medicine, and until within the last two or
three days declining even to go to bed. It was the opinion of her
physicians that if at an early period she could have been persuaded to
use means she would unquestionably have recovered, but she would not,
"and princes," our Diarist remarks, "must not be forced." Her fatal
obstinacy brought her at length into a condition which was irremediable.
For two days she had lain "in a manner speechless, very pensive and
silent,"--dying of her own perverseness. When roused she showed by signs
that she still retained her faculties and memory, but the inevitable
hour was fast approaching. The day before, at the instance of Dr. Parry,
she had testified by gestures her constancy in the Protestantism "which
she had caused to be professed," and had hugged the hand of the
archbishop when he urged upon her a hopeful consideration of the joys of
a future life. In these particulars our Diarist takes us nearer to the
dying bed of the illustrious Queen than any other writer with whom we
are acquainted.

Dr. Parry remained with the Queen to the last. It was amidst his prayers
that about three o'clock in the morning which followed Manningham's
visit to the palace she ceased to breathe.

For the last few years the public mind had been disturbed by claims put
forth on behalf of a multitude of pretenders to the now empty throne.
The people had been bewildered and alarmed by the production of no less
than fourteen different titles advanced on behalf of a number of
separate claimants. A strong impression prevailed that on the Queen's
death a struggle was inevitable--that the long peace which the country
had owed to the Tudors would come to an end with them. The vacancy had
now occurred, and every one was anxious to know in what manner the
claimants would prefer their claims, and who would arbitrate amongst
their clashing interests? Above all things, as likely to involve the
most important changes, what course would be taken by the Roman
Catholics? It seemed a great opportunity for them, so great that no one
imagined they would allow it to slip past.

The statements of our Diarist at this time are of particular interest.
The ministers of the late Queen acted with equal promptitude and
prudence. Sir Robert Cecil had settled the matter long ago, and all his
fellow-ministers now concurred in what he had done. Not an instant was
lost; at the very earliest moment, at day-break, in less than four hours
after the Queen had ceased to breathe at Richmond, a meeting of the
Council was held at Whitehall. A proclamation already prepared by Cecil,
and settled by the anxious King of Scotland, was produced and signed. At
10 o'clock the gates of Whitehall were thrown open. Cecil, with a roll
of paper in his hand, issued forth at the head of a throng of gentlemen,
and with the customary display of tabards and blare of trumpets
proclaimed the accession of King James.

"The proclamation," remarks our author, "was heard with great
expectation and silent joy, no great shouting." At night there were
bonfires and ringing of bells, but "no tumult, no contradiction, no
disorder in the city; every man went about his business as readily, as
peaceably, as securely, as though there had been no change nor any news
of competitors." The quickness and unanimity of the council, combined
with the popular feeling in favour of King James, fixed him at once in
the new dignity. Opponents were overawed and silenced when they found
that the supporters of the King had as it were stolen a march upon them,
and that, although he himself was absent, his friends were in possession
of all the powers of government on his behalf. The previous agitation
subsided almost instantly. The disturbed sea rocked itself to rest.

From this time general anxiety was directed towards the North. "The
people is full of expectation, and great with hope of our new King's
worthiness, of our nation's future greatness; every one promises himself
a share in some famous action to be hereafter performed for his prince
or country." The anticipations which the people framed for themselves
from the change of sex in their new governor, from the change of age,
and from the ambition which they imagined would be developed in him by
his transference from a small rough unsettled country to one which by
forty years of steady government had acquired a unity, a solidity, a
definite and noble position among the nations of the world, of which all
true Englishmen were proud, have no where been brought so clearly before
us, as in the pages of our Diarist. Such anticipations were like the
fire of brushwood. It is painful to think of the disappointment to which
they were doomed.

Besides these events of an historical character, there are scattered
through the Diary a multitude of notices of persons of less social
position than Elizabeth and James, but not by any means of less
interest. Living among lawyers, it was of course that many of the young
student's notes would relate to them. But many of the lawyers of that
day, both those who had earned the honours of their profession and those
who still remained _in statu pupillari_, were men about whom we can
never learn too much. In these notes we have glimpses of Sir Thomas
More, of Bacon, Coke, Lord Keeper Egerton, of Judges Anderson, Manwood,
and Catline, of the merry old Recorder Fleetwood, of his graver
successor Croke, and of the beggar's friend, Sir Julius Caesar. Among the
younger men we may notice Sir Benjamin Rudyerd, the future Lord Chief
Justice Bramston, and the man who in the coming stormy times was for a
period more prominent than them all, the statesman Pym. It will be seen
in a note at p. 104, that the publication of this volume has given an
opportunity for the settlement of the question, whether Pym had what may
be termed a regular legal education, which his biographers have left in
doubt. The Middle Temple has clearly the high honour of reckoning him
upon their roll.

Of non-legal persons who are here brought before us with more or less
prominency, we need scarcely allude to the entries relating to
Shakespeare and the performance of his Twelfth Night, which were first
noticed by Mr. Collier, and have been used by every subsequent writer on
dramatic subjects. The unfortunate Overbury comes before us several
times, such as we should have expected to find him, inconsiderate and
impetuous. Ben Jonson flits across the page. Of Marston there is a
disagreeable anecdote which has not been left unnoticed by poetical
antiquaries. Sir Thomas Bodley and Lord Deputy Mountjoy are alluded to.
There is an excellent account of an interview with old Stowe the
antiquary, a valuable glimpse of the Cromwell family during the boyhood
of the Protector, and references, some of them of importance, to Sir
Walter Raleigh, to his foolish friend Lord Cobham, to the wizard Earl of
Northumberland, and of course many allusions to the Cecils, both to Sir
William, and to that youngest son to whom, according to the joke which
is here preserved, his father's wisdom descended as if it had been held
by the tenure of Borough-English.

One peculiarity of this Diary is the very large proportion of it which
is given up to notes of sermons. There is something in this which is
characteristic of the time as well as of the writer. It was a
sermon-loving age, and that to a degree which it is scarcely possible
for us to understand in our degenerate days. Another thing which is
equally at variance with modern notions is that, when reading the
original manuscript, we pass at once from passages which we have been
obliged to reject as unfit for publication to notes of pulpit addresses
which inculcate a high-toned morality based upon those sound principles
which apply even to the thoughts and feelings. It is clear that the
incongruity in this contrast which is painful to us was not then
perceived. The coarseness of the popular language on the one hand, and
the affection for pulpit addresses, even among students of the Inns of
Court, on the other, were both parts of what we are accustomed to term
the manners of the age, and, like all things universally accepted, their
rights and wrongs were never very minutely criticised. The language we
have objected to is of course entirely indefensible. It was the slough
of a coarser generation, which our ancestors had not then entirely cast
off.

Of many of the sermons as represented in these notes we think highly,
but we have printed the whole of them in smaller type, so that they may
be distinguished at a glance, and if there be any of our readers to whom
they are less acceptable, they may be easily passed over.

Among the preachers who are here commemorated will be found some of the
most celebrated divines of the day;--Dr. Lancelot Andrewes, Dr. James
Montague, Dr. John Buckeridge, Dr. John King, Dr. Parry, and Dr. George
Abbot, none of them yet Bishops; Andrew Downes the Grecian; Dr. Thomas
Holland, Regius Professor of Divinity at Oxford; Dr. Giles Thompson,
afterwards Dean of Windsor; with two fervid orators, frowned upon by
many of their brethren, but most influential with the people,--one of
them Mr. Egerton, whose congregation assembled "in a little church or
chapel up stairs" in Blackfriars, and the other Mr. Clapham, who was the
incumbent of a church at Paul's Wharf.

In notes, for the most part very skilfully taken,[14] of sermons of men
so various in their acquirements, and many of them so eminently
distinguished, we have examples of the pulpit oratory of the age, with
evidences of the nature of the doctrines then generally prevalent in the
Church of England, and of some of the qualities which tended to make the
preaching of those doctrines popular.

    [Footnote 14: So skilfully that one is inclined to suspect that the
    business of note-taking may have been at that time one of the
    branches of legal education. A few occasional mistakes of course
    there are, and when extremely palpable we have sometimes not thought
    it worth while to notice them.]

Nor is the book devoid of notices of many other circumstances which were
characteristical of the time. The following are examples. At p. 22 we
find an account of the operation of lithotomy, stated to be then first
brought into medical practice; at p. 46 we learn that "a certain kind of
compound called _Laudanum_" had been recently introduced as the
chloroform, and at p. 132 that the game of shuttlecock was the croquet,
of the day. In another place (p. 110) the fantastical and affectedly
humble salutation to the knee alluded to by dramatists of the period is
said to have been one of the many changes in fashion attributed to
English travellers returned from Italy. At p. 36 there is a notice of an
article apparently of fashionable costume which we are unable to
explain, "Kentish tails." It is said of these things, whatever they
were, that they "are now turned to such spectacles, so that if a man put
them on his nose he shall have all the land he can see." What
connection, if any, there may be between the tails here mentioned and
the old legend of Kentish tails, we are obliged to leave to the
consideration of persons versed in the antiquities of that county.[15]
There are other passages which deal with the fashions of the day. It was
a time in which ladies' dressing-rooms were nearly allied to
apothecaries' shops, and the art of manufacturing female beauty seems to
have fallen into the hands of probably a lower and irregular class of
medical practitioners. The poets are full of allusions to this subject.
Massinger sums it up in a passage which we may be excused for quoting:--

                      there are ladies
    And great ones, that will hardly grant access,
    On any terms, to their own fathers, as
    They are themselves, nor willingly be seen
    Before they have ask'd counsel of their doctor
    How the ceruse will appear, newly laid-on,
    When they ask blessing.    .    .    .    .
    .    .    .    .     Such indeed there are
    That would be still young in despite of time;
    That in the wrinkled winter of their age
    Would force a seeming April of fresh beauty,
    As if it were within the power of art
    To frame a second nature.

    [Footnote 15: We referred the passage to our late dear friend the
    eminent Kentish antiquary and founder of the Archaeological Society
    for that county, the Rev. Lambert B. Larking, and received in reply
    one of his customary kindly and suggestive letters. Since we wrote
    to him, his earthly career has come, alas! to an end. The Camden
    Council have lost a distinguished member, and many persons a
    singularly warm-hearted and unselfish friend. He was indeed one of
    those attractive characters who carry into old age the fervour and
    generosity of early life. There never lived a man in whose heart of
    hearts there dwelt a deeper scorn of everything untruthful,
    disingenuous, or mean, or who was more distinguished by a total
    abandonment of all selfish interests. Deeply versed in the history
    of his beloved native county, and possessed of large antiquarian
    collections derived principally from unpublished materials, the
    information which he had gathered through a course of many years was
    at the service of every applicant, and frequently furnished valuable
    materials for other writers, whilst an over-anxiety to attain an
    impossible completeness prevented his bringing to an end works which
    would have established his own right to a high position in the
    literature of research. His work on the Domesday of Kent we trust
    will soon be issued to the subscribers. We doubt not that it will
    justify our estimate of the scholarship and diligence in inquiry of
    our kind and amiable friend.]

The anecdotes jotted down by the young Templar speak for themselves.
They of course derive their principal value from the names to which they
are attached. Notices of personal peculiarities are so singularly
evanescent, they live so entirely in the observation and memory of
contemporaries, that it is a biographical gain to have them recorded in
any shape. Apparent trifles, such as the waddling gait of Sir John
Davies, the stately silence of Lord Montjoy at the dinner table, the
description of the popular preacher Clapham--"a black fellow with a sour
look but a good spirit, bold and sometimes bluntly witty," the fussy
particularity of Fleetwood the recorder, the vanity of old
Stowe,--these, and memoranda such as these, impart a life and reality to
our conceptions of the men to whom they relate, which cannot be derived
from volumes of mere dates and facts.

Of the recorded witticisms, the peculiarity which will strike the reader
in this case, as in all others of the same description, is their
singular want of originality. Good things which were current in the
classical period are here re-invented, or warmed up, for the amusement
of the contemporaries of King James. And the same thing occurs over and
over again, from generation to generation. _Mots_ which descended to the
times of Manningham reappeared in the pages of Joe Miller, are recorded
among the clever sayings of Archbishop Whateley, and in one instance at
least may be found among the pulpit witticisms of Rowland Hill.

The book is one which would bear a large amount of illustrative
annotation. We have endeavoured in most cases to keep down what we had
to say to mere citation of the ordinary standard books of reference--the
tools with which all literary men work. It is well for them that our
literature can boast of instruments so well suited to their purpose as
Dr. Bliss's edition of Wood's Athenae, Mr. Hardy's edition of Le Neve's
Fasti, and Mr. Foss's Lives of the Judges--the books to which we have
principally referred. May the number of such works be increased!

Finally, we have the grateful task of returning thanks to two gentlemen
who have specially assisted us in issuing this book. To Mr. John
Forster, the author of the Life of Eliot and of many other valuable
historical works, we are indebted for the use of a transcript of part of
the Diary here printed; and to Mr. John Gough Nichols, like the Editors
of most of the volumes printed for the Camden Society, we owe the great
advantage of many most useful suggestions during the progress of the
work. The results of their kindness and of the liberality of Mr. Tite
will we hope be acceptable to the Society.

MARCHE 28, 1602.[23]

    [Footnote 23: This was Palm Sunday.]

At the Temple: sermon, the text, Mark, x. 20.

Notes: All the commandementes must be observed with like respect. It is
not sufficient to affect one and leave the rest vnrespect, for that were
to make an idoll of that precept. Obedience must be seasoned with love;
yf any other respect be predominat in our actions, as feare of
punishment, desyre of estimacion &c. they are out of temper.

Christ propoundes these commaundementes of the 2nd table, because, yf a
man cannot observe these, he shall never be able to keepe them of the
first, for yf a man love not his neighbor whom he hath seene, howe shall
he love God whom he hath not seene?

And he that is bound to observe the lesse must keepe the greater
commaundement.

The doctrine of justificacion consistes upon these pillars, 1. _Ex
merito, si non ex condigno at ex congruo._ 2. And this upon free-will,
for noe merrit with[24] a free agent. 3. And this upon a possibilitie of
keeping the commaundementes, for _liberum arbitrium_ is a power of
performing what wee would and should, and _libertas voluntatis_ and
_liberum arbitrium_ are severall.

    [Footnote 24: _Sic_, but _qu._ "without."]

Noe man can performe anie any action soe well but he shall fayle either
in the goodnes of the motion efficient, the meanes, or end.

[Sidenote: fo. 5^b.]

Justificacion by workes is but old Pharisaisme and newe Papisme; the
Papists distinguishe and make _Justiciam legalem_ and _evangelicam_; the
1. in performance of outward required accions; the 2. in the intent
supplied [?]

All the sacrifices that God was most delighted with are for the most
part sayd to be young, a lambe, &c. and the exhortacion of him which was
more the agent and more learned than anie, for he was a King and the
wisest that ever was, is, Remember thy Creator in the dayes of thy
youth, &c.

There is a generall and a speciall love of Christ wherewith he embraceth
men; the 1. is here ment and mentioned, and with that he loves all which
doe but endeauour to be morally good; soe doubteles he loved Aristides
for his justice, which was a work of God in him, and so being a good,
God could not but love it, and him for it.

But the speciall is that whereby he makes us heires of eternall lyfe,
and adoptes vs for his children.

Beholding him, God regardes the least perfections or rather imperfect
affections in us; he will not breake a crazed reede.

Note: The breade in the sacrament becoming a nourishment is a medicine

The manner of receyving Christes body in the sacrament; as to make a

knowe it is relligious.

Speaches are either historicall of a thing past, propheticall of a thing
to come, legall of a thing to be done, or figurative when one thing is
said and an other ment. Figures there are in scripture, two almost
peculiar, typicall and sacramentall, the one shewing one thing by an
other, the other declaring what is conferred by another.

Moses had speciall commaundment to erect this Serpent, and yet God did
not dispense with the 2nd Commaundment, for this Serpent was not made to
be worshipped, but to be looked upon.

God cannot dispense with anie commandment of the first table but he
should cease to be God, as the first, Thou shalt have none other[62]

The Scripture telleth us that of all beasts the Serpent is the most
subtill, and his subtilty is obserued in three points: first, when those
nations in Syria and other hott countries found themselues often
endangered by the stinging of venomous beasts, amongst other remedies
they invented charming, which the serpent perceuinge, to auoyd their
cunning and effect his malice, he would stop both his eares, the one by
laying it close to the earth, the other by stopping it with his tayle.
Soe fareth the synner; lett the preacher speake never soe heauenly, yet
will he close one eare with worldly thoughts, and the other with fleshly
imaginacions. The second property of his subtilty is in defending his
heade, where his lyfe lyes, it will soe winde it selfe about that part,
that [it] is a matter of greate difficulty to cutt of a serpentes heade.
In every man there is some radicall and capitall synn, which is
predominant, and this the devil endeavours by all slightes to preserve.
The third point of the serpents subtilty is accounted the attractiue
power which remayneth in the heade deuided from the body, for it is
proved by experience that, yf a serpent be cutt in many peeces, yf his
heade remaine aliue, yet that part will gather the rest togither againe;
soe leave the head synn alive, and it will gather a whole body againe.

As Christ is the heade of the Churche he never suffered nor dyed.

The brasen Serpent was made like the live and true serpents in all
thinges, the sting onely excepted; Christ was made like man in all
things sauing synn.

All which beheld the brasen Serpent were cured; all that beleeve in
Christ are saved.

Remedies are either naturall, by virtue of some inherent qualitie in the
medicine applied; or by diuine influence and institution, when some
thing is effected either beyond or contrary to the force and nature of
that which is used. And this is miraculous; soe was the curing of the
blind by laying spittle and clay upon the eyes of the blinde. Soe the
cure of the lame by washing in the poole of Bethesdas, and soe the
healing of the Israelites by beholdinge the brasen Serpent.

said to be the author of synn permissive, and an actor in synn, though
not the author of the synne, for ther is noe action but he is the first
cause of it: and yet he is noe partner or cause of the il in the action,
noe more then he which rideth vpon a lame iade, can be said to be the
cause of his limpinge, though he be the cause of his paceinge, nor a
cunning musician the cause of discordes when he playeth on a lute that
is out of tune. There is a two-fold power in every thing, and both
derived from God; the one of creacion, whereby every thing worketh
according to nature, as the fyre to burne, &c.; and the other of
preservacion, whereby that force is continued, and if the second be
withdrawne the first perisheth, for God is not a mere efficient
externall, as the taylour of the garmente, or a carpenter of the house,
whose effects may continue though their labour continue not, but he is
an inherent continuall assistant cause, soe that yf he withdrawe his
power of preseruing the power of creacion is idle, soe the fire in

abundantly all things to enioye."

Charge them that they lift up their soules to God in heavenly
meditation, not against God by worldly presumption.

Charge the riche, therefore there were diversitie of condition and

God made some riche, and some poore, that twoe excellent virtues might
flourishe in the world, charitie in the riche, and patience in the
poore. Pride is the sting of riches. _Tolle superbiam, et diuitiae non
nocebunt._

A man may speake of his owne riches, soe it be without arrogancy, for it
is a good thinge to speake of the loving kindenes of the Lord.

Magistrates and rich men must not be like the filling stones in a
building, but arche and corner stones, which support others.

When persons of meane worth thrust themselves into places beyond their

Themistocles said there was no musicke so sweete vnto him as to heare

I depart I will send him vnto you."

    [Footnote 63: Dr. Lancelot Andrewes was Dean from 1601 to 1605, when
    appointed Bishop of Chichester. He was afterwards translated, first
    to Ely, and afterwards to Winchester. This sermon was preached on
    Whitsunday.]

These wordes have reference to the feast which is celebrated this day:
whereupon St. Augustine said, _In verbo fuit promissio missionis, et in
festo missio promissionis_: for soe it is in the second of the Acts.
"When the day of Pentecost was come they were all filled with the Holy
Ghost."

These words were spoken to the disciples when their hearts were full of
sorrowe that Christ must part from them, and therefore had need of
comfort, for they had cause of sorrowe, for yf a man would not willingly
be forsaken of any, as Paule complayneth 2 Tim. iv. 10, that Demas had
forsaken him, would it not greiue the disciples to [be] forsaken by such
a frend as Christ had bin vnto them, whoe in one place speaking vnto
them asketh this question, Which of you hath wanted any thing since you
followed me? And in an other place he compareth them while he continues
with them to the children of the bridechamber.

[Sidenote: 23 May, 1602.

Besides the tyme of his departure might aggravate their sorrowes, for
it was then when he foretold soe many persecutions should come upon
them. And therefore here he ministers words of comfort, telling them
that is expedient, and expedient for them, that he should leaue them,
for thereby they should receive a benefit, and that of soe high a nature
as they were better to want him then it. And further for their comfort
he added, that, though he would forsake them, yet he would not leaue
them like orphanes destitute of all frends, but would send them a
Comforter.

And here he made his prayer, which being ended with the Lordes prayer,
he proceeded with his text: and first noted that Christ rendred a reason
of his departure, though it be not requisite alwayes that gouernors
should render a reason to their subiects of all their commaundments, for
in the 1 Sam. the Kinge gives noe other reason but it was his pleasure.
2. It is a mylde reason, not harshe like that in Marke ix. cap. 19 v.
"O, ye faythles generacion, howe long shall I bee with you, how long
nowe shall I suffer you?" but here he deliueres it meekely, and moues
them with expediency, and that not for himselfe, _non nobis, sed vobis
expedit_. And therefore because it is expedient it ought not to greive
them, in soe much as the profit they shall gayne will countervayle the
pleasure which they must forgoe by his departure.

And yet it might seeme strange that they should gayne by loosing him; it
is reade, _Dissolve coelum et veni ad nos, Domine_, and againe, _Veni
ad nos, et mane nobiscum_. But to goe from them what desyre could they
haue? Here may arise three difficulties. 1. The disciples might have
rejoyned, and sayde, What neede, what care wee for any other Comforter?
soe long as you are with us, wee desyre noe other. 2. Why might not the
Holy Ghost have come, and yet Christ tarried with them; could they not
be togither? 3. Howe can it be expedient for anie to loose Christ? what
comfort can there be in those wordes which tell them Christ will forsake
them?

1. Our happiness is to be reunited to God, from whom we were fallen by
our first fathers synn; for as it is the perfection of a branche that is
broken of to be ingrafted againe that it may growe with the body, soe is
it the felicitie of man to be vnited to his Creator. And in this vnion,
as well as God must be partaker of man, soe must man be made partaker of
God, otherwise there can arise noe vnion: the former was effected by
Christ's incarnacion, and the second is perfected by the inspiration of
the Holy Ghost, whoe is as it were the connexion and loue knot of the
deitie. Christ hath as it were made his testament, and the Holie Ghost
is the executor, 1 Cor. xii. Christ is the word: and the Holy Ghost is
the seale of it, 2 Corin. i. 22. "Christ hath purchased redemption for
us:" and the Holy Ghost must give us seisin, Eph. i. 14. And in
conclusion Paule sayth, viii. Rom. 9, "He that hath not the Spirit of
Christ is not his:" and therefore was it expedient and necessary that
the Holy Ghost should come; for, as Christ was _complementum legis_, soe
is the Holy Ghost _complementum Evangelii_.

2. They may stand togither, they may beare one an others presence, for
the manhood of Christ was conceiued by the Holy Ghost, and the
Euangelist sayth, _Vidi Spiritum descendentem et manentem super eum_.
But yet it was expedient they should not be togither vpon the earth;
expedient, as Augustine noteth, _non necessitatis pondere, sed divini
consilii ordine_, and two reasons are given for [it] in the part of the
Holy Ghost. 1. Yf the Holy Ghost should have come downe while Christ was
upon the earth, whatsoever the Holy Ghost should have done in his person
would have bin ascribed to Christ. 2. He would have appeared to have
bin sent from the Father alone. And soe it would not have bin so
apparant that he proceeded from the Father and the Sonne bothe.

3. Expedient it was that Christ should depart from them, howe good
soeuer his presence was vnto them. Wee knowe that bread is the strength
of mans hart, yet sometymes it may be expedient to fast: our bloud is
the treasury of our lyfe, yet sometymes it is expedient to loose it; our
eyesight is deare and precious vnto us, yet sometymes it is expedient to
sitt in a darke roome. And here it is expedient that Christ should
withdrawe his presence, not corporal onely, but his invisible presence
of grace alsoe. 1. It is expedient that children which growe fond of
their parentes should be weaned. The Apostles were to full of carnall
and terrene cogitacions even after his resurrection; they asked him,
Wilt thou restore the Kingdome to Israell? therefore nowe it was highe
tyme they should put of childishnes and be taught, as Paule sayth that
henceforth they knowe him no more in the fleshe; and this must be
effect[ed] by withdrawing his corporall presence, which they began to
dote upon; and for the taking away the presence of his grace, that was
expedient alsoe. 1. Least being to full they should begin to loath it,
as the Children of Israel did manna in the wildernes. And upon this
reason did the prophet threaten a famine of the word when the people,
being full, contemned it. 2. That they should not growe proud with
abundaunce; the Psalmist sayth, "Yf I say I cannot be removed," and "It
is good that I was in trouble, for before I went wronge." Peter was soe
sure and confident upon himselfe, that yf all the world should haue
forsaken Christ, he would not, and therefore because he stoode soe much
vpon himselfe it was expedient that suche a swollen bladder should be
prickt, as he was till he denied and forswore his master; And even this
withdrawing of grace was a kind of grace, that seing his owne weaknes he
might possesse his soule in humility, with[out] which there is noe grace
to be expected. And therefore, _expedit superbo vt in peccatum incidat_.
And to this purpose are these wordes of Paule that the messengers of
Sathan, _i. e._ temptacions, were sent to punish him, least he should
growe proud.

Christ is our advocate in defending vs when the Divel accuseth vs
falsely; he is our intercessor and mediator by pleading a pardon for vs
when Sathen layes his greatest and truest accusations against us; he is
our high priest to offer sacrifice for vs.

Christ left them not as orphanes, but sent another unto them whoe was
equall with himselfe, otherwise they should have loss by the change.

The Holy Ghost hath diuers offices and soe diuers effects: he enlightens
the understandinge, and soe is called the Spirit of truth: he certifies
the will, and soe is named the Spirit of Holines: he delivers from the
bondage of Sathan, and soe is the Spirit of comfort, which is the cheife
and very consummacion of all. The Holy Ghost is not given to all in the
same measure, nor the same manner. When Christ breathed vpon his
disciples they received the Holy Ghost; and, when the Holy Ghost came
like fyrey tongues, they were filled with him: breath was warme, but
fyre is hotter: there was heate in both, but not equally. Elias prayed
that the Spirit of [Elijah] might be doubled upon him.

The gifts of the Holy Ghost are obteyned and perfected divers wayes;
vnderstanding and fayth by the word which is the truthe; holynes of
lyfe, by prayer, meditation, and good workes; consolation by receiving
the sacraments.

Mr. Barker; his text Luke ix. and the last verse, "Noe man that putteth
his hand to the plough and looketh back is apt to the Kingdome of God."

The fyre from Heaven which consumed the sacrifices in the old lawe was
preserved by continuall addicion of fuell, soe the heauenly virtue of
Chrystian charitie being kindled in the hart of man, must be preserved
by continuall meditacions on the word of God. Yf any should aske why it
was commaunded in Leviticus that the people should offer _primitias_ and
in Exodus that they should alsoe give _decimas_, I should make no other
answer, but that wee should not onely remember our Creator in the days
of our youth, but alsoe serue him in holines and righteousnes all the
dayes of our lyfe.

_Aliud est incepisse, aliud perfecisse._

Some in their liues, like the image in Nebuchadnethers dreame, Dan. ii.,

The Diuel laboureth most against our perseveraunce because that virtue
onely hath a promise of coronacion.

There be but seven steps in the ladder that leades downe to hell, and
the lowest, saving desperacion, is a custom of synning.

These combined discommodities ensue the custome of synning; _fit
diabolus ad oppugnandum audacior, anima ad peccandum promptior, Deus ad
condonandum difficilior._ This virtue of Christian magnanimity or
perseveraunce consisteth in _patiendo et faciendo_: in _patiendo_, 2^o,
in _ferendo et perferendo_; _faciendo_, by continuance in preaching
fayth, and in good lyfe.

Christ compared Christian profession to a plough. And why, 1. to soe
base a thing, 2. to soe laborious a thing, 3. to that onely? 1. That
none howe base soever by condicion or profession should despayre of
attayning Heaven; and meane thinges may be compared with the greatest.
Christ sayth the Kingdom of Heaven is like a litle leaven, and to a
smaller thing then that, it is like a grayne of mustard seede; and here
to a plough, that none might despayre. Simon a tanner, Peter a fisher,
Paul a tent-maker, Joseph a carpenter.

Some great ones, Theophilus. Some ladyes, in the Acts. Some customers,
and some from the beggars, as Lazarus. And yet, that rich men might not
contemne it for the baseness, he compares it to a riche jewell, a
precious stone, &c.

2. The place of the preacher is a calling of great paynes and trauaile.

Four things in the effect of the Sermon; fayth in beleuing God, and that

Noted by Jonahs crying in the middest of such a city, that the preachers
must not be timerous to tell anie of their faults, nor feare the person
of anie man. Yet he reprehended those which are to sharpe reprehenders
without circumstaunce. Such as Bernard calleth _non correptores, sed
corrosores_, such may be termed _bilis et salsugo_, like the people of
India which are said to barke instead of speakinge; _canis et tuba
vitiorum._ But, as he misliked those sharpe biters, soe must he needes
speake against such preachers as flatter greate men, and sowe cushions
under their elbowes. They are like Heliotropium, which turnes the flower
with the sunne, though a cloud be interposed, soe they follow greatnes
though clouded with synn; like the riuer Jordan, turnes and windes euery
way; speake nothing but silken wordes; at last the[y] become _serui
multitudinis_; say anie thing to please the people.

Nineveh, as St. Augustine in his booke _De Civitate Dei_, signifieth not
the citie but the synns of the people; and soe the prophecy verryfied,
for that synn was destroyed by their repentaunce within 40 dayes. But he
rather inclined to expound it by way of an implyed condicion, that they
should be overthrowen vnles they repented; soe was that prophecy of Isah
understoode to Hezekiah, Isaiah xxxviii. "Thou shalt dy and not live."

OUT OF SPANISHE, _and sent to hir Majestie_ BY LORD H. HOWARD.[77]

    [Footnote 77: Created Earl of Northampton in 1604-5, died 1614.]

Hir Majesties affections are not carued out of flint, but wrought out of
virgin wax, and hir royall hart hath ever suted him in mercy, whom hir
state doth represent in Maiesty.

If anie sentence were mistaken by equivocacion of wordes, or ambiguity
in sence, I onely blame the stintles rage of destinie, which ever
carryeth the best shaftes of my unluky quiuer to such endes as are most
distant from the white I aymed at.

Since I began, each fruit hath answered his blossom, each grayne his
seede, all eventes there hopes; my selfe onely, more vnfortunate then
all the rest, have sowne with teares, but can reape with noe reuolucion.

I have presumed once againe (least the ground of my deuocion, by lying
to long fallowe, might seeme either waxen wyld or ouergrowne with
weedes,) to breake the barren soyle of myne vnfruitfull brayne, that
prosperous successe may rather want at all tymes to myne endeuors, then
endeuor to my loyall determinacion.

You are that sunne to me, whose going downe leaues nothing but a night
of care.

The divel, like those painters which are skilfull in the art of
perspectiue, taketh pleasure, by false colours and deceitfull shaddowes,
to make those things seeme farthest of which are nerest hand (as death),
and to abuse our nature with vayne hopes.

As the glasse of tyme is turned euery hour vpside downe, soe is the
course of our vncertaine lyfe; as that part which before was full is
emptied, and that other which was emptied is replenished, soe fareth
this world interchangeably.

As the highest region of the ayre is cleare and without stormes, soe hir
minde free from all distemperes of affection.

Those that liue not in the safe arke of your gracious conceit, &c.

The sea can brooke noe carcasses, nor hir Majesties thoughts admit of
castaways.

The fig-tree never bare fruit after it was blasted by the breath of
Christ; noe plant can prosper that never feeles the comfort of the same;
soe, &c.

In this the difference, Adam dyed because he eat of it (_i. e._ the tree
of lyfe), but I shall dye before I looke on it.

Manie find frends to couer faults; my cloke is innocency. An eye may be
cleare enough yet not discerne without your light; a course may be
direct yet endles without your clewe. My dealings may be free from base
alloy, but yet not currant amongst honourable persons without the liuely
print of your cherefull countenaunce. What dangerous diseases breed in
bodyes naturall by putrefaction springing out of the sunnes eclipse, the
same, or rather greater by proportion, must growe in well affected
myndes by the darke vayle of your discouragement.

Patience like a pill by continuall vse looseth his virtue.

I wonder at your matchles worth as they that are borne vnder the North
Pole doe at the sunne, whose comfort they feele not at all, or without
anie great effect.

Praye that since there is but one period and bounder, one high water
marke both of your happie life and our countryes good, the same may be
inlarged aboue ordinary termines, defended by all extraordinary meanes,
and augmented with all speciall fauour which either death possesseth or
heaven promiseth. That ever in the zodiack, our princely virgin may
assend with assistance of all happie planets.

Such is my beliefe in your administracion of right, as with the
faythfull daughter of Darius, while I live I will deeme _me captum esse
quamdiu Regina vixerit_.

The world is governed by planets, not fixed starrs.

As the fox and the asse were travayling by the way, they overtooke a
mule, a strange beast as they thought, and began to be verry
inquisitive, like a couple of constables, to know whence he came and
what his name might be. The mule told them his name was written in his
foote, and there they might reade it yf they would; the foxe dissembling
sayd he was not bookish, and askt the asse what he could doe. He like an
asse, without feare or witt, went about to shewe his schollership; but,
while he was taking up the foote to reade what was told him, the mule
tooke him such [a] blowe with his foote that the asse paid for his
cuning [?]. Such are meere schollers. (_Ed. Curle._)

My cosen told me that the custome of burning women with their husbandes
in Goa began vpon this occasion; the women of that country being
skilfull in poysoninge, and exceedingly giuen to the synn of lechery,
could noe sooner like an other, but presently their husband would dye,
that they might marry him whom they best liked: whereuppon it came
to[81] passe that one woman burried manie husbands, and soe the King
lost many subiects. And therefore to preuent this mischiefe the King
ordeined, that, whensoeuer the husband died, the wife should be burned
with him, in great solemnitie of musike and assembly of frendes,
esteeming by this meanes to moue the wiues to make much of their
husbands, yf not for the loue of their companie, yet for loue of their
owne liues, since their safety consisted in their preseruacion.

promised to the Lady Walsingham,[84] that he would make him that nowe is
President after Dr. Yeilder's[85] decease, and for this purpose expelled
such fellowes as he thought would be opposite, and placed such in their
roomes as he knewe would be sure vnto him. By this meanes Dr.
Chamberlaine was defeated of his right, being an Oxefordshire man, whom
by their statutes they are bound to preferr before anie other.

    [Footnote 86: "Lady Poliuizena" was Anne dau. of Giles Hoofman or
    Hooftman, of Antwerp, mentioned in p. 51, and widow of Sir Horatio
    Palavicini, a well known native of Genoa settled at Baberham, in co.
    Cambridge. Sir Horatio died 6th July 1600: his lady, fulfilling the

    married to Sir Oliver on the 7th July 1601. Sir Henry Cromwell who
    is mentioned in this paragraph was the Golden Knight; father of Sir

    In the April before his death, Sir Oliver, being in possession of

proued soe wealthie that he gave 10,000_l._ with his daughter in
marriage to Sir Horatio Poliuizena, now deceased, and the widdowe
married to Mr. Oliuer Cromewell, the sonne and heir of Sir Henry
Cromwell. This marriage, and certaine land he had from his Uncle
Warrein,[89] cleared him out of debt.

    [Footnote 89: Sir Henry Cromwell's first wife was Jane daughter of
    Sir Ralph Warren, Lord Mayor of London in 1536 and 1544. Sir Ralph
    had an only son named Richard, who was seated at Claybury, Essex.

Dr. Spenser[94] preached. He remembred in his prayer the Companie of the
Fishmongers, as his speciall benefactors while he lived in Oxford; his

    [Footnote 94: Dr. John Spenser, fellow-student with Hooker at Corpus
    Christi College, Oxford, and president of that college from 1607 to
    1614. Wood states (Ath. Oxon. ii. 145) that he was "a noted preacher
    and a chaplain to King James I." It was to him that upon Hooker's
    death his MSS. were delivered over for completion of the
    Ecclesiastical Polity. The sermon of which Manningham took such
    copious notes was printed in 1615, after Dr. Spenser's death, under
    the editorship of Hamlet Marshall, his curate. The author of the
    Christian Year speaks of it as "full of eloquence and striking
    thoughts; the theological matter almost entirely, and sometimes the
    very wordes, being taken from those parts of Hooker in which he
    treats of the visible church." (Hooker's Works, ed. Keble, i.

We are soe blind and peruerse by nature, that wee are soe farre from the
sence of our owne imperfections and the terror of our synn, that either
not seing or not acknowledging our owne weaknesses, wee runne headlong
into all wickednes, and hate soe much to be reformed, that God is fayne
to deale pollitikely with vs, propounding our state vnto vs in parables,
as it were an others case, that thereby drawing man from conceit of
himselfe, which would make him partiall, he might draw an uncorrupt
iudgment of him self from him selfe. Soe dealt the Lord with David by
the parable of the poore mans sheepe, and soe here he taketh up a
comparison of the vine, to shewe Israell their ingratitude.

Parables are proportionable resemblances of things not well understoode;
they be vayles indeed, which couer things, but being remoued give a
kinde of light to them which before was insensible, and makes them seeme

by the vine. 2. Gods benefits towards the Churche expressed in the
manner of his dressing the vine. 3. The fruit expected, grapes, iudgment
and righteousnes. 4. The fayling and ingratitude, by bringing forth
sower and wylde grapes; oppression and crying. 5. God's judgment, vers.

[Sidenote: fo. 40^b.]

In the Church he considered, what it is, and where it is.

The Churche is compared most aptly to the vyne, for neither of them
spring naturally. _Non sumus de carne, nec voluntate hominis, sed
bene-placito Dei._ 2. Both spring, and growe, first in weakenes, yet
then they claspe their little hands and take hold on of an other, and
soe going on _crescunt sine modo_, the increase without measure, as
Pliny sayth. 3. Noe plant more flourishing in the summer, none more
poore and bare[95] in winter. All followe the Church in prosperitie, and
the rich, the mighty, the wise, in persequution fall away like leaves.
4. Bring forth fruit in clusters, which cheres the hart. God and men and
angels reioyce when the Church aboundes in workes of righteousnes and
true holines. 5. Both have but one roote, though manie branches; Christ
is the true foundacion, other then this can no man lay. 6. The branches
are ingrafted, and as in planting all are tyed alike with the outward
bond, yet all proue not alike, soe all haue the same profession and
outward meanes, yet all growe not nor fructifie alike: but it is the
inward grace that maketh the true branche; as he is a Jewe that is one
within. Rom. ii. 28, 29.

[Sidenote: fo. 41.]

2. The Lord's vineyard is not to be knowne by the fruit (for we reade
here that it bringeth forth wyld grapes), but where the roote is
planted, where Christ is professed, there the Church is; it is nowe
universall, not yed to anie place; we reade of 7 Churches in the
Reuelacions, though all not alike pure, yet all churches: Israell is his
eldest sonne, though a prodigall: as betwixt man and woman after a
publique contract celebrated, though the woman play the harlot and bring
forth children of fornicacion unto hir husband, yet continues shee his
wife whose name shee beares vntill a publique divorce be sued. Some
churches are soare, some sicke, some soe leprous that noe communion
ought to [be] continued with them, yet churches still. Yf anie aske, as
manie papists use to doe, where our church was before Martin Luther was
borne, we aunswer that it is the same churche that was from the
beginninge, and noe newe on as they terme it, for the weeding of a
vyneyard is noe destroyinge, nor the pruning any planting; for we have
remoued but idolatrie and a privat masse of ceremonies, which with the
burying the author[?] of life in a hidden and unknowne language had
almost put the heavenly light out of our candlesticke; and when the
trashe of humaine inventions had raysed themselues to soe high esteeme,
it was tyme to say, "Yf Ephraim play the harlot, yet lett not Israell
synn."

[Sidenote: fo. 41^b.]

Jerusalem litterally is the mother Churche of all.

The Churche, like the vine that hath many branches but one roote, may
haue severall members, but all knit together with the vnity of three
bonds--one Lord, one fayth, one baptisme. But nowe Rome, usurping over
his fellowes, speakes like Babilon in the 18 Reuel. "I cannot erre," and
have encroched an article vpon the Creede, that must be beeleeved upon
payne of damnation, that there is one visible heade of the Churche
(which must be the Pope). And yet in an oecumenical Counsell of 330
Catholike Bishops it was decreed that Constantinople should have equall
authority with Rome; which plainely confuted their usurped universall
supremacy. Yet the Popes, by the assistaunce of the Emperours, haue,
like ivy, risen higher then the oke by which it climed: soe much that
our countriman Stapleton doubts not to call his Holines _Supremum in
terris numen_.

3. The benefites and manner of dressing the vine: Genesis is but the
nurse of it; Exodus, the removing; Leviticus, the ordering and manner of
keeping it; Josua, the weeding, &c. God soe loued it that he gave his
onely Sonne to redeeme it, and when he gave him, what gave he not with
him?

Might not the Church use the wordes of the leeper in the Ghospell:
"Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me cleane;" and why then
complaynest thou?

[Sidenote: fo. 42.]

True it is, yf we consider his power: for he that is able to rayse vp
children to Abraham of stones, to make the iron sweate, &c. can purifie
our corruptions yf wee regard his power, and that without our meanes;
but God hath tyed himself to ordinary meanes, by his eternall decree:
and he that will not heare Moses and the prophets neither will he
beleeve though one should rise from the dead. Many were foule with the
leprosie in Nathans [Elishas?] tyme, yet none cured but Naman.

4. The fruit. All things, euen the meanest, imitate the Creator in doing
something in their kind for the common good, not themselves alone; the
olive doth not anoint itself with its owne oyle; the trees and plants
which spend themselues in bringing forth some fruit or berry holds it
noe longer then till it be ripe, and then letts it fall at his masters
feete; the grape is not made drunke with its owne iuyce.

"He that receiveth a benefit hath lost his liberty," saith Seneca; and,
since we have received such benefits of God as we can not, we would not
renounce, lett us glorifie him in our bodies whose we are, not our owne.

Aeternitie cometh before we worke, therefore our workes merit not
eternall life: and infants incorporat into the mysticall vyne are saued
though they dy before they are able to bring forth anie good worke.

Our good workes growe as it were in a cold region; the best of them,

Good workes to be performed for mutuall helpe, and though we holde
ourselves sufficient, yet they are to be done, even as every thing
bringeth forth something yf for noe other purpose yet to continue in its
owne state; like the spring, which, because it yeildeth water, is
therefore continually fed with water.

_Bona opera sunt via regni, non causa regnandi. (Bernard.)_

The fruits brought forth; wyld grapes: an heavy sight to a carefull
husbandman, to haue noe better reward of his paynes.

I pray God the Church of England may not justifie the synns of Sodome
and Judas. Couetousnes, the roote of all wickednes, maketh men desyre to
be greate rather then good, and this desyre causes them to sucke even
the lyfe from one another. There is a synn amongst us which hath not bin
heard of amongst the Gentiles, that wee should robb God, and that is in
tithing. Howe manie desyrous that the labouring man, the minister, might
be put out, that themselues might haue the inheritaunce. It is the
corruption of the ministery that all the dores of entraunce are shut up
but the dore of symony, soe that the most and best places are for the
most possessed by the worst; and, yf anie of the better be forced to
come in, they are constrayned to make shipwracke of a good conscience.

If it be true which is published in the names of the popish faction, the
Pope hath sent a dispensation that the popish patrons may sell their
presentations, soe be it the money come to the maintenance of the
Jesuites. And will Peters successor thinke it lawefull to sell the
guifts of the Holie Ghost? Will Simon Peter become Simon Magus? But he
will nowe become a fisher for men; because he findes in their mouthes
greater peices then twenty pence. The ministers are like the hart and
liver, from whence are derived lyfe and nourishment by sound doctrine
and good example into the members of the Church, and yf these be corrupt
it is much to be feared the whole body is like to languishe in a
dangerous consumption.

The examples are bipartite: each containing contrary doctrines, like the
language of them in the last chapter of Nehemias, half Jewishe, half
Ashdoch; like the bands of the Levites, that parted themselves one
companie to one mount to blesse, the other to an other to curse, the
people; soe the one part denounceth judgment, the other declareth mercy:
they may be compared to the cleane beastes, Deut. xiv., which had parted
hoofes, and chewed the cudd; soe here on the one syde is the old world
drowned, on the other Noach saved; on the one Sodom burned, on the other
Lott preserved. They are three of the strangest and fearefullest
examples in nature; the fall of the Angells, the drowning of the world,
the burning of Sodome; they stretch from one end to an other, alpha and
omega, heaven and earth, men and angels, the most excellent payre of
God's creatures, and the deluge oecumenicall and universall. But God
in his punishment, like a wise prince, will begin at his owne sanctuary,
at his owne house, _non habitabit mecum iniquus_, I will not suffer a
wicked person to dwell in my house, and therefore first turned the
angels from his habitacion. Angels in their creacion, _vere_ [Greek:
deuteron], the second light, the eyes and eares of the great king,
continuall attendantes in his court and assistauntes of his throne; they
are farr above the greatest saint, for wee shalbe but like them, and
they are next to the Sonne of God, otherwise he had said nothing when he
said, to which of the angells sayd he at anie tyme, &c. _Heb._: they
were _in summo non in tuto_, or rather _non in summo sed in tuto_,
untill they synned. But what their synne was, I may safely say I knowe
not. One sayth _non seruarunt principatum_, and St. Jo. sayth, _non
steterunt in veritate_, their synn was treason, [they] continued not in
their allegeaunce and fidelity; an other, _et in angelis vacuitatem,
prauitatem, infamiam reperiit_; an other, though an absurd opinion, that
it was fleshly lust, and concupiscence, by carnall copulacion with women
upon earth, and this they would lay upon these wordes, and the Sonnes of
God tooke the daughters of men; but of this it was sayd, _perquam noxium
audire et credere_. And yet it became as common as it was absurd,
because men thereby thought they might sooth themselves in that synn,
and thinke it tollerable when angells had done the like before them.

An other opinion more probable, that it was noe carnall, but spirituall
luxury that overthrewe them, a kinde of selfe love, when they overvalued
their owne excellency, and forgat their Creator; and this opinion that
their synn was pride is the most receiued and most like, because after
his fall the first temptation that he made was of pride to Adam in
paradise, _enim similis altissimo_.

which was not first in apprehension. Yet he may be sayd to affect it
_desyderio complacentiae, non efficaciae_, because he might please himself
with such conceits, not conceaue howe he might attaine to those
pleasures, and to this purpose some there be that write as though they
had been taken up into the third heaven, and heard and seene the
conflict betwixt Michael and the diuel: and will not stick to affirme
that Michael had his name because when the diuel like a great giant
bellowed out blasphemie against the most highest, denying that he had
any creator or superior, Michael should resist and tell him, _Quis ut
Deus_, which is the interpretacion of Michael; soe though it be
incertaine what was the synn of angells, yet is it most certayne that
they fell from the highest happines to the lowest wretchednes; the fall
was like lightning suddein, and the place of it not possible to be
found; it passeth the capacitie of man to expresse it by comparison soe
perfectly that he may say _hoc impetu_; and for their payne it is
_transcendens, et transcendentia transcendit_, it is invaluable,
incomprehensible, passeth all hyperbole; there was a present amission of
place, grace, glory, the fruition of Godes presence, &c. which is the
greatest of miseries, _felicem fuisse_: but there remaines a fearefull
expectation of future miseries, _et Nihil magis adversarium quam
expectatio; et Quo me vindicta reservas?_

It was the opinion of Origen long since condemned for erronius, that the
diuels might be saued, and his reason was because they had _liberum
voluntatis arbitrium_, which might perhaps change and encline to the
desyre of good, and soe through repentaunce obteyne mercy; but the
diuels are soe obdurate in their malice that though they may have
_stimulum conscienciae_, yet they can neuer come _ad correptionem
gratiae_, and in that opinion Origen is said [Greek: Platonizein] non
[Greek: Christianizein]. Another prop to his opinion was Jacobs ladder,
where he imagined the descending and ascending of angels could meane
nothing but the fall and restitution of angels.

The second example is the drowning of the world, a descent from heaven
to earth in judgments. The world is termed [Greek: kosmos] of the
Grecians, from the excellent beauty thereof, and of the Lattynes
_mundus, quia nihil mundius_, but here it is used to expresse the
universalitie of the destruction, as the hystorie declares it Gen. vi.
7, etc. vii. 21, 22, 23, 24: God destroyed euery thing that was vpon the
earth from man to beast, to the creeping thing, and to the foule of the
heaven, onely the fishes escaped, and the reason one rendreth was
because the sea onely was undefiled at that tyme; there was then noe
sayling upon that element, noe pyracie and murder committed upon it, noe
forrein invasion intended over it, noe trafficque with the nations for
straunge comodities, nor for one an others synnes and vices; all the
other creatures were polluted by man, and were [to] be purged with that
floud. The ayre as farr as our eyes could looke and fascinate, even the
foules as far as our breath could move, were infected with the contagion
thereof; all were uncleane, all were to be clensed or punished. The
greatnes of their number cannot excuse, but aggrauates the offence. A
multitude may synn and their synn is more grievous, _qui cum multitudine
peccat, cum multitudine periet_; and for the most part, the most are the
worst. It is noe sound argument, it is well done because many doe so.

"And brought in the floud:" and therefor a miracle supernatural wrought
by the finger of God, not as some imagine by the conjunction of
waterishe planets, soe atributinge all to and confirming all by naturall
meanes, they say the world shalbe destroyed by fire, as it was by water,
when there shall happen the like conjunction of firy, as there was of
watery planets; but beleeve God, whoe sayth _Ego pluam_. And this was
against nature to destroy hir owne workes. The length of the rayne,
forty dayes, the continuaunce of the waters for twelve monethes, the
dissolucion of soe muche ayre with water as should make a generall
deluge. These are directly against the rules of naturall philosophie,
besydes the influence of a planet never stretcheth beyond his
hemisphere, all which shewe plainely, that it was the miraculous worke
of God, not effected by the course of nature. This was not _imber in
furore missus_, to destroy or famishe some particular city or country,
of which kinde of baptismes our land hath within fewe yeares felt many,
but this made the sea, which before made but one spheare with the earth,
as man and wife make but one flesh, breake the boundes of modesty and
overflowe the whole; that which before was the girdle of the earth, nowe
girt it, but in such a fashion, that it stiffled all. It was such a
dropsie in the world, that our simples having lost their former virtue,
we were permitted to eat flesh for the preseruacion of our liues, which
before were prolonged with the naturall herbes and fruits of the earth,
more hundreds then nowe they can bee scores with our best helpes of art

But it may be said, What, will God punishe the goode with the wicked?
Will he drownd, all together, the righteous and the bad? Will he say
_Pereant amici, modo pereant inimici_? Will he command _stragem tam
amicorum quam hostium_? Shall his judgments be like the nett in the
Gospell, that catcheth good and bad togither? Noe, for he punished the
old world. This floud was his sope and nitar to scoure of the filth, to
seuer the good from the euill, the wheat from the chaffe. He brought the
floud upon the ungodly, but he "saued Noah, the eighth person;" a small
number, a child may tell them, a poore number, _pauperi est numerare_,
but eight persons saved. Those tymes were evil, but there are worse
dayes not instant but extant, wherein iniquitie prescribes hypocrisie,
settes hir hand to manie false bills, settes downe one hundred for ten,
the whole is overflowne with all wickednes, &c. The second part is God's
mercy, but he "saued Noah" like a ring on his finger, he kept him as
writing in the palme of his hand, as the apple of his eye, and as a
seale on his heart. He built him a castle stronger then brasse, and
lockt him up in the arke like a jewell in casket. He preserved him safe
in a wodden vessell amongst the toppes of mountains, in a world of
waters, without card, tacleing, or pilot. He was saued between judgment
and judgment, like Susanna betwixt the twoe elders, like the Children of
Israell betweene two walles of water in the Red Sea, like Christ
betweene the two theiues; soe that it may be truly sayd, it was noe
meaner a miracle in sauing Noah, then in drowning the whole world.

But "saued Noah, the eight person, a preacher of righteousnes." Here is
a banner of hope to all that feare God. When Justice was running hir
course like a strong giant to haue destroyed the whole world, Mercy
mett, encountered, and told hir that she must not touch Gods anoynted,
nor doe his prophetes anie harme. There was Noah, "a preacher of
righteousnes," and he must be spared, he was a preacher, not a whisperer
in corners, singing to himselfe and his muses. This Noah was the hemme
of the world, the remnant of the old, and the element of the newe: he
was _communis terminus_, the first shipwright, and yet "a preacher of
righteousnes." Nowe concerninge the estimacion of preachers in auncient
tymes, and the contempt of that calling in these dayes, their high
account with God, and their neglect with men, from hence he said he
could paradox manie conclusions which tyme forced him to ouer slip. But
in this age lett a preacher be as aunciently discended and of as good a
parentage, bee as well qualified, as soundly learned, of as comely
personage, as sweete a conversation, have a mother witt, and perhaps a
fathers blessing to, lett him be equall in all the giftes and ornamentes
of nature, art, and fortune to a man of an other profession, yet he
shall be scorned, derided, and pointed at like a bird of diuers strange
colours, and all because he beares the name of a preacher.

Tymes past were so liberall to the clergy that for feare all would have

Church, what will he doe with those which buy and sell his church

"A preacher of righteousnes" or a righteous preacher, such a one as Jo.
Baptist was; he preached, as all ought to doe, by his lyfe, by his
hands. By his lyfe; _vel non omnino vel moribus doceto._ He preached
amendement from synn, he preached the lawes of nature and the judgments
imminent, and as some thinke he preached Christ alsoe. And wee preache
the lawe of nature: doth not nature teache you, &c. Wee preache faythe:
then being justified by faythe. Wee preache the lawe of Moses: Christ
came not to breake but to fulfill the lawe. We preach righteousnes,
_semen et germen_, embued, endued, active, and contemplative,
justificacion and sanctificacion, primitiue and imputed, the one in
Christ absolute, the other in us. Righteousnes acted by Christ and
accepted by us, which is the true justifying righteousnes, and aboue all

"And deliuered just Lott." The word signified a kinde of force, as

continenter vixisse, eximium._ Soe was Abraham in Chaldea, Moses in the
Court of Pharao, and yet noe partakers of the synnes of those places,
"vexed with the uncleane conversacion." _Non veniat anima mea in

wicked. When Martiall asked Nazianzeene but a question, Nazianzeene told
him he would not answere _nisi purgatus fuerit_. Wee must not say soe

Mr. Hadsor[114] told Mr. Curle and me that he heard lately forth of
Irland, that whereas on Burke, whoe followes the Lord Deputy, had
obteyned the graunt of a country in Irland in consideracion of his good
seruice, and this by meanes of Sir Robert Cecile, vpon Sir Robert
Gardneres certificat vnder his hand, and all this after passed and
perfected according to the course in the courts in Irland. Nowe of late
an other Burke, one of greate commaund and a dangerous person yf he
should breake out, hearing of this graunt, envyed, grudged, and
vpbrayded his owne deserts, intimating as much as yf others of meaner
worth were soe well regarded and himselfe neglected, he ment perhaps to
give the slip and try his fortune on the other party. The Lord Deputy
having intelligence hereof, and foreseeing the perilous consequence yf
he should breake out, sent for the otheres patent, as desyrous to peruse
the forme of the graunt, but when he had it he kept it; and, upon aduise
with the Counsaile, cancelled both the patent and the whole record, to
preuent the rebellion like to ensue upon the graunt. A strange
president.

MR. FENTON, reader of Gray's Inn. His text, Luke xix. 9, "This day is
salvacion come unto this house: insoemuch as this man also is become the
sonne of Abraham." This is an absolution, and a rule of it, 1. He that
pronounceth the absolution is Christ; 2. The person absolued is Zachee.
An example that may most move this auditorie to followe Christ; since
this man was rich and a ruler of the people, whereas the most of them
that followed Christ had nothing to loose; 3. The ground of his
absolucion, that he was the sonne of Abraham, which he proved to Christ
by his fayth, to the world by his works. He observed 5 parts: 1. The
nature of the absolution, that it is a declaracion of saluacion. 2. By
whom it is declared, viz. by Christ. 3. How far it extended, to Zachee
and his family. 4. Upon what ground, that is, his fayth and repentaunce.
5. Howe soone, "This day."

Saluacion is come; wee are not able to seeke it; therefore Christ sayd,
"Enter into thy fathers joy;" for wee are not capable that it should
enter into us; but enter into that joy as the bucket into the fountayne.

apostles; "Whose synnes you binde shallbe bound, whose synnes you remitt

The raysing of Lazarus, a resemblaunce of absolucion. Lazarus had layen

Not all poore blessed, but the poore in spirit onely; nor all rich

Howsoever Christs words import a greate difficulty for rich men to enter
into heauen, when, after he had compared heauen gate to a needles eye,
and the rich man to a cammel, hee aunswered his disciples words, that
all things are possible with God, and as though it were a miracle with
men. Hardly can he runne after Christ when his hart is lockt vp in his
coffer. But the scripture tells us there is a rich Abraham in heaven, as
well as a Dives in hell. Yf anie have inriched themselves by forged
cauillacion lett them not despayre, for soe did Zache. Yf anie have a
place that he must have vnder him as many officers as Briareus had
hands, through whose hands many things may be ill carried, lett him not
be discouraged, for soe had Zache. Yf anie be branded with infamie lett
him yet be comforted by the example of Zache, for soe was hee, and yet
became a true Christian.

Saluacion came unto Zache by a threefold conveyaunce: 1. By his riches,
which to the good are sacramentes of His favor. 2. That himself being
conuert, his whole family was soe; the servants and attendants are the
shaddowes of their master; they moue at his motion. 3. That all his
househould was blessed for his sake; such are the braunches as the
roote; the whole lumpe was made holie by the first fruits.

To become the sonne of Abraham is to receive the image of Abraham. He

the burden seeme light to the lame man when he carried his bed, after
Christ had cured him. 2. In hospitallitie he received angels, and
amongst them God, for one was called Jehoua. 3. In despising to growe
rich by ill meanes. Sodome could not make him rich, because he would not
have it said that the diuel had made him riche.

There is none but would spend the best bloud in his body, and stretch
his verry hart strings, to be made sure of his salvacion; but the matter
is easier, you must stretch your purse-strings, and restore what you
have gotten wrongefully, otherwise noe security of saluacion.

you will say that is taken away by the gospell. Should I sett before you
the commendable examples of such as professed restitution, you will
alledge your owne imperfection--they were perfect and rare men, wee must
not look for such perfection. Shall I tell you there are but four crying
synnes, and this is one of them--"The syn of them that have taken from
others by fraud or violence cryeth before the Lord of Hosts," as though
nothing could appease but vengeance. Yet, you will say, though the syn
be heynous, yet the mercy of God is over all his workes, and there is
more virtue in the seede of the woman to heale then there can be poison
in the serpent to hurt us. And God forgiueth all upon repentaunce. 'Tis
true God absolueth the penitent, but upon condicion that he restore the
pledge that he withheld, and that which he hath robbed. But may not this
be dispensed withall by the gospell? The shaddowe points at the truthe.
In the v. of Numbers, 7 [v.] besides the ransom for the attonement, the
goods that were deteyned must be restored. Christ resembleth the ram,
&c. _Ob._ Hath not Christ paid all our debts for us? Yes, but such as
thou couldst not pay thyselfe; he hath satisfied God for thy syn, and
thou must satisfie thy brother for the wrong thou hast done him yf thou
beest able, otherwise thou must look for noe absolucion, for without
repentaunce and amendment noe absolucion, and without restitution no
true repentaunce. It may be you will say you are sorry for that you have
gayned wrongfully, and meane to doe soe noe more. This is noe true
sorrowe nor sufficient repentaunce, for soe long as you reteine the
thing, there is a continuaunce of the syn, for thou holdest that
willingly which was gotten wrongfully. Surely yf a theife had taken your
purse, and should tell you he were sorry, but could not finde in his
heart to give you it againe, you would thinke he did but mocke you. But
be not deceived, God will not be mocked. Glaunces make noe impression.
There is a worldly sorrowe, and there is a godly sorrowe. Soe long as
the goods are retained _poeitentia non agitur sed fingitur_. But
_paenitentia vera non est paenitenda_. But you will say, yf I should make
restitution I should empty manie of my bags, and make a greate hole in
my lands, and this would make me sorry againe; but this is worldly. Soe
there would followe a certaine kinde of shame upon restitucion; but the
point is to resolve first to restore, and then doubt not but the wisdome
of God will cause you to restore without shame, as the cunning of the
diuel made you gett without shame.

This day. When God came to reprehend and denounce judgment against Adam
in Paradise, it is sayd he walked; but when he comes with saluacion he
comes with hindes feet swiftly. This day. Against procrastinacion and
deferring repentaunce. It is a fearefull saying, they shall striue to
enter in and cannot, because they came not soone enough; too many think
they have the Spirit of God in a string, and are able to dispatch all
while the bell is tolling. But God sayth, they shall cry, but I will not
hear them; then they shall seeke me earely, but they shall not finde me,
because they cry and seeke too late. The example of the theife on the
crosse is noe example. It was a miracle, that Christ might shewe the
power of his diuinity in his greatest humiliacion: besides, the theife
had moe and greater graces then manie of the disciples at that time, for
some had forsaken and none durst confesse him. And besydes, he were but
a desperat theife that would presume because the prince had graunted one
pardon.

Outward actions of Christ point at inward and spirituall matters; the
raysing of Lazarus that had bin dead three dayes was with great
difficulty. Christ was fayne to cry out and grone ere he could get him
up. And the disciples could not cast out the diuel that had possessed
the man from his infancy. And when Christ cast him out it was with
wonderfull tormentinges to the possessed; soe dangerous delay, for the
difficulty to repent, syn growing as deare as old, &c.

AT PAULES,

MR. TOLSON of Queenes Colledge in Cambridge; his text in Ephes. v. 25:
"As Christ alsoe hath loved the Church, and hath given himself for hir,
that he might sanctifie it."

The blessinges of God to man are infinit and exceeding gracious; many
being giuen which we knowe not of, many before wee aske them, manie
which wee are unthankefull for; but of all this gift is most admirable,
most inestimable, Christ gave himselfe.

He considered the person giving, the party receiving.

There is noe creature soe base and little but if it be considered with
reason it may shewe, as were written in greate caractars, that there is
a God.

God is infinit and eternall, therefore can be but one in essence. One
person doth not differ from another really in the essence of deity. Yet
each person differeth really from other, and haue their proper personall
operacions not common to all. Soe here Christ is said to have giuen
himselfe, that is, the person of the sonne of God, perfect God and
perfect man; he gave not his body, nor his soule, nor his whole
humanitie onely,--for if all the creatures in the world were heaped up
togither to be giuen, they were noe sufficient sacrifice to satisffie
the justice of God,--but he gave himselfe, his whole person.

But two deaths of the soule, synn and eternall damnacion; to affirme
that the soule of Christ suffered either were horrible blasphemie.

Wee must soe worship God as a trinity in vnity, and an vnity in trynity,
otherwise we worship but our owne fastasie.

Christ was _et sacerdos et sacrificium_, he gave himselfe.

_Christus totus mortuus est, non totum Christi_, the whole person of
Christ and both his natures suffered; his deity and soule being mortall
could not, but his whole person, wherein both natures are indissolubly
united. _Christus homo in terra, deus in coelo, Christus in utroque._

Christ not made in nor by the Virgin, but of the Virgin; therefore
perfect man, not an essence of a nature above the angels but inferior to
the Godhead: but the splendor or brightnes of Gods glory, the engraven
forme of his person, (Hebr. i. cap.) therefore perfect God.

He gave himselfe not for all men, but for his Church; he died for all
_sufficienter non efficienter_; he would have all men saued, _revelata
non occulta voluntate_, or rather, as a Father sayth, _Deus vult omnes
salvos fieri, non quod nullus hominum sit quem non velit salvum fieri,
sed quia nemo salvus fit nisi quem velit_; he saveth whom he pleaseth,
and they are saved because he will.

Christ gave himselfe for the Church, and hence growes the greate
quarrell betwixt Papists and us Protestants, for, this gift being soe
precious that none can be saved without it, every one is ready to
intitle himselfe thereunto, and challeng his part therin; noe heretike
so damnable, but would hold he was of the Churche, but the point is
whether they bee what they pretend, or haue what they arrogate. And
here, because, as he said, the text gaue him occasion, and he had
direction from the superuisor of this sea, he spake some thinge against
the common enimye.

The Church is compared unto the moone for fayrenes and to the sonne for
brightnes, therefore the church is not a companie of reprobates, and
idolatrous hereticks, as Rome is. Christ is not the head of such a body.
Those which give him such a body doe, as the poet sayth, _humano capiti
cervicem adjungere equinam_, but if they define the Church such a
congregacion, the[y] may easily mainteane theirs to be one.

The Papists have a trick of appropriatinge the name of the Church to
themselves onely; as they reade the Church, it is theirs dead sure; but
this is but the fashion of Cresilaus of Athens, a franticke fellowe,
that would board all ships that arrived, searche and take account of all
things as they were his owne, when poore fellowe he was scarse worth the
clothes on his backe.

The Papists call their masse a bloudles sacrifice, but yf wee look backe
but [to] the late tymes before hir Majesties happie entraunce, wee may
see tokens and wittnes enough, that it is the most bloudy kind that ever
was invented.

Christ gave himselfe: noe virtue that is not voluntary: he gave himselfe
willingly, soe saith he, "I lay downe my life, and noe man taketh it
from me," though the Jewes layd violent hands upon him, which made them
inexcusable; yet because yf he would have resisted, they could not have
effected their malice, therefore his subjection to their violence was
voluntary.

Nowe from informing your understandings, give me leave, said he, to
proceede to the reforming your wills and affections.

Vses. Since Christ hath giuen himselfe for vs, such worthles creatures,
such nothings indeed, let us dedicate our soules, ourselves, our
thoughts, and actions to his service for a reasonable sacrifice. Christ
gaue his whole person for vs, wee must give our whole selues to him; not
as some which are content to be present at his seruice, but haue their
myndes about other matters; or as others which will say they haue given
their mynds to God, and serue him in their soule, though their bodies be
present where he is most dishonored, as the yong degenerat trauayler
that can be content, be present, and perhaps partaker at a masse, and
yet thinke he can be sound at the hart for all that. But wee must apply
both body and soule to Christs seruice. Most trauaylers returne, either
worse men or worse subjects; caveat in permitting to many trauailers.
Some can be content to be feruent and zealous in the halcion dayes of
the gospell, as Peter, but lett the sword, persecution, be once drawne
out the[y] strait withdrawe them selves and leaue their maister. Yf
the[y] think they spie a tempest but comming a farr of, strait they runn
under hatches. Yf Judas come with a kisse, and a companie with swordes
and staues, they are gone. All were hott and zealous against the Papist
in the beginning of hir Majesties raigne; all cold, as it were asleepe,
nay dead, in these tymes.

MR. LAYFEILD AT ST. CLEMENTS.

His text, 2 Cor. iii. 7: "Whoe hath alsoe made us fitt ministers of the
Newe Testament, not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter
killeth, but the spirit quickeneth."

He had preached heretofore of this text, and had in that sermon obserued
out of this place that the duty of a Christian and a fitt minister are
severall and distinct. Nowe he considered the object whereabout the
office of a minister is imployed, which is the Newe Testament, and to
this purpose he shewed the difference betwixt the Old and Newe
Testament, the old lawe and the newe, which consisted not onely in this
(which the Papists make to all), that the newe is more plaine then the
old, and that Moses was the writer of the first and Christ of the
latter; but this the true essentiall difference, the old was a covenant;
a mutuall sponsion and stipulacion; a promise upon condicion; something
to be performed on either part. _Fac hoc_, sayth God to man, this is the
lawe to be observed by man, _et vives_, and I will give thee lyfe; trust
me with that. But the gospell, the Newe Testament, is a covenant
absolute, like that "I have made a covenant with myne eyes," and that "I
have made a covenant with David that I will not fayle:" a promise on
Gods part onely, like a testament in this, that it is a free donacion
without condicion precedent, all meerely of grace and favour from God.
Noe merit from us. When he assended he gave gifts unto men.

When man had entered into covenant with God, and by breaking of it
became soe farre his debtor that he had forfayted body and soule for his
synn, God dealt mercifully with him, and tooke a sacrifice of some
living beast as a bond which deferred, not satisfied, the debt, and this
to continue till Christs comming, whose death should be a discharge of
that obligacion, and the whole debt alsoe for soe manie as could obtaine
Christs favour.

In the afternoone, the same man at the same place. After a briefe
recapitulacion of what he had deliuered in the forenoone, he proceeded
to shewe the office of a minister of the Newe Testament, with the
difference betweene the preists of the Old and the ministers of the Newe
Testament. The office of those was to teache the covenant, to denounce
the curse, and to take sacrifices of synners as obligacions and
testimonies against the synner that he had soe often forfayted his soule
and body; the office of the minister of the New Testament is to preache
both the lawe to deject and humble the synner by the operacion of the
spirit; and the gospell to rayse and comfort him, that he may not
despayre and dye, but beeleeve and be saved; their office is alsoe as
executors of Christs testament to dispose of his legacyes, his promises;
that is, to remitt synnes to every penitent beleeving synner; and
lastly, to impart and confirme the graces by ministring his blessed
sacraments.

The letter killeth, for that sayth in the lawe, Thou must doe this, thou
must not doe that, otherwise God must be satisfied; thou must be
punished, or els thou must have pardon. Man could not obserue them; man
was not able to abide the punishment--was like a man in prison, could
not gett forth to sue for pardon; was like a poor man deepely indebted,
had noe meanes to make satisfaction. The gospell likewise in the letter
sayth, Thou must repent, thou must beleeue, or els thou canst not be
saued; and yet none of them is in our power. But the spirit quickeneth;
that shewes vs Christ hath satisfied, and giues vs grace to beleeve it,
&c.

The lawe of the Old Testament is not abolished by the Newe, but the old
covenant, the condicion of the lawe, is taken awaye; for the lawe
continues and hath a singular vse in the ministry of the Newe Testament,
to make a synner knowe and confesse himselfe such a one, for before he
finde his synnes greuous he hath noe neede of a sauiour; as Christ sayd,
"I came not to call the righteous but synners to repentaunce," and "Come
vnto me, all ye that are weary, and I will easye you," and "The whole
neede not the physitian."

Yf the minister dispense Christs legacyes to a counterfayt and
dissemblinge penitent, yet they haue done their duty. And as Christ sayd
to his disciples, "When you enter into anie place, say peace be with
you, and yf the Sonne of peace be not there, your peace shall returne
againe vnto you."

Christ made his testament, bequeathed legacyes, made his executors the
disposers of them: therefore there must be certaine markes and notes, as
certaine as the names of persons to knowe the persons to whom the
legacyes are bequeathed, otherwise the executors cannot knowe howe [to]
dispose of them. And these markes are fayth and repentaunce, for to
euery one that repenteth and beleeueth remission of syn is giuen: and
therefore it followeth, against the doctrine of the Church of Rome, that
a man must beleeue, and knowe that he beleeueth, hath fayth and
repentaunce, for that generall fayth of that church in generall is noe
more but to beleeue noe [more?] but this, that all that is in the
Scripture is true, that all that beleeue shall be saued, and that noe
man knoweth whether he beleeue or repent. But, on the contrarie, we hold
that beleeue and fayth must be in particuler, and then such a person is
become a legatary certaine in Christs testament, and capable of the
disposicion of the promise.

the second lesson; having sat a good tyme before in the pulpit, willed
them to sing to the glorie of God and theire owne edifying, the 66 Psal.
2 part; after he made a good prayer, then turnd the glas, and to his
text, Acts vii. 23, &c. Here he made a recapitulacion of that he had
deliuered the last Sabboth, and soe he came to deliuer doctrines out of
this text. When he had said what he thought good of it, he went to
catachise; it seemes an order which he hath but newely begun, for he was
but in his exordium questions; then he prayed, sung a plasme [psalm],
gave the blessing, and soe an end.

He remembred out of his former text these notes, v. 17: That God
performes his promises not in our tyme, but in his tyme, which is best,
because he is wisest. 2. The pollicy of man folishnes with God. They may
maliciously oppose themselves therein, but cannot alter his decree. 3.
God makes our enimies become our frends, and causeth them to doe good
vnwittingly. 4. Parents ought to giue their children educacion, as well
as foode and rayment, and rather bring them up in learning and trades,
then proud inheritances with wronge. 5. Moses a good orator and a good
warrior, mighty in wordes and in deedes, yet modest in all.

Then in his text: Not dispaire of calling, for Moses was 40 yeares old
before he thought of this busines. 2. God put the motion in his heart.
3. Lawefull to protect the wronged and reproue them that doe ill, though
a man be hated for his labour. 4. The good rejoyce and are glad to see
the magistrate, and euery good Cristian and true subiect glad to see the
principall magistrat with a gard about, as well to reward and protect
the good, as to reuenge the wronged, glad like[132] one that in a hott
sunshine sees a fayre leauy tree, which promiseth a shaddowe yf he be
sunburnt; such is the prince to the good subject.

He defined catechising to be a breife and familiar kinde of teaching the
principles of relligion, in a plaine manner by way of question and
aunswere, either publiquely by the minister, or privately by the maister
or mistres of the family. Herein noted the difference betwixt preaching
and catechising, that that is a large continued course of speache, and
may be performed onely by the minister.


It is the custome (not the lawe) in Fraunce and Italy, that yf anie
notorious professed strumpet will begg for a husband a man which is
going to execution, he shal be reprieved, and she may obteine a pardon,
and marry him, that both their ill lives may be bettered by soe holie an
action. Hence grewe a jeast, when a scoffing gentlewoman told a
gentleman shee heard that he was in some danger to haue bin hangd for
some villanie, he answered, "Truely, madame, I was a feard of nothing
soe much as you would have begd me." * * *

in brasse and prefixed in print to his Survey of London.[133] He sayth
of it, as Pilat sayd, "What I have written, I have written," and thinkes
himselfe worthie of that title for his paynes, for he hath noe gaines by
his trauaile. He gaue me this good reason why in his Survey he omittes
manie newe monuments: because those men have bin the defacers of the
monuments of others, and soe thinks them worthy to be depriued of that
memory whereof they have injuriously robbed others. He told me that the
Cheife Citizens of London in auncient tymes were called Barons, and soe
divers kinges wrote unto them "_Portegrevio et Baronibus suis London._,"

In the afternoone, at a church in Foster Lane end, one Clappam, a blacke
fellowe, with a sower looke, but a good spirit, bold, and sometymes
bluntly witty; his text Salomon's Song, iv. ca. 3 v.: "Thy lips are like
a thred of skarlett." For the exposicion of this text he said he would
not doe as many would after the fancy of their owne braine, but
according to the Scripture, expound it by some other place, and that was
ii. of Josua, where he findeth the same words, a skarlet thred, v. 21,
"Shee bound the skarlet threed in the windowe." He told a long story of
Rahab before he came to the threed; and after almost all his sermon was
some allusion to that story. Rabby Shulamo makes this comparison, that
the lips are said to be like a threed of skarlett, to signifie such
person in the churche whose promises are performaunces, whose wordes are
workes, as the red threed was a simbole and a signe unto Rahab. Rahab
was a tauernes, and it signifies alsoe an harlot, because such kinde of
people in that country used to sell their honesty with their meate. Like
scarlett; the colour sheweth life within, as palenes death.

Joshua a type of Jesus, and the wordes the same in seuerall languages.
Moses could not bring the children of Israel into the land of promise,
but that was the office of Joshua; the lawe could not be our saviour,
but Christ is he that must bring us to heaven. Joshua sent two spies;
Christ obserued the same number, and alwayes sent two disciples
togither. 3. What the spies undertooke and promised according to their
commission was firme and ratified by Joshua; whose synnes the disciples,
and nowe the ministers, according to their power, remitt or binde on
earth, shalbe remitted or bound in heaven.

There are enough of Rahab's profession in euery place; a man may finde a
greate many more then a good sorte. "I would not give a penny for an 100
of them," said he.

Rahab beleeved and shewed it by hir workes. Every one will say he
beleeues, but except he can showe it to me by his workes, I will not
give two strawes for it; lett him carry it to the exchange and see what
he can gett for it.

finde I goe away with some wound or other. "Be therefore comforted" sayd

When God deliuered his people from the Aegiptians he led them with a
pillar of light, but caste a darke cloud betwixt, "and soe the blinde
buzards," said he, "ran up and downe, they knewe not about what."

When he shewed that Salmon was the husband of Rahab, he said "Yf anie
nowe, after 44 yeares preaching, and the bible being in English were
ignorant of that, it were a horrible shame." And here he sett downe a
posicion that none could soundly interpret or vnderstand the Scripture
without genealogy, which he commended verry highly.

and it is apparent that noe sureties are put in since the death of my
cosen, nor since the death of one Savil an other obligor. The condicion
of the other was, whereas Mr. Aldriche had deputed William Sumner to
exercise his office, that he should not comitt any thing which might
amount to a forfayture of the letters patents whereby Mr. Aldriche held
his office, and alsoe that William Sumner should performe all covenants

of payment, his widdowe executrix desyred the whole, Sumner denied all,
yet, in regard that Mrs. Aldriche should cancell his bondes and make him
a generall acquittaunce, he offred 20 markes, and the arbitrators gaue
but 20_l._, which Sumner refuseth to pay, and therefore the widdowe

Dyned with my cosen Watts, at my cosen Cranmers in Canterbury. In
discourse howe obstinate some are, that they will not confesse a fact,
wherefore they were justly condemned, my cosen Cranmer remembred this
story. Not long since one Keyt a Kentishe man had made [his] will,
whereby he bequeathed a great legacy to one Harris, but after, being
displeased, he gave out that he would revoke his will, and Harris should
have nothing, whereupon Harris, thinking to prevent his purpose, hired a
thrasher to murther him. This poore knave having effected this villany
began to grow resty, could not endure to worke any more, but would be
maynteyned by Harris for this feate, otherwise most desperatly he
threatened to reveall the matter. Thus the fellowe fedd soe long, and
spent soe lavishly upon himselfe and his queanes, out of Harris's purse,
that Harris, growing weary of the charge, began to thinke howe he might
conceale the first by practising a second murther; which he plotted in
this manner, he would invite the knave to a dynner at Maidstone, and
procure some to murther him as he should come through the woodes. But
the fellowe, fearing the worst (because they had bin at some hott words
before) imparted his feare to his whore whome he kept, told hir that yf
he were murthered shee should accuse the Harrisses, and wisht hir to
looke in the bottome of his deske, and there shee should finde that
would be sufficient to hang them. As he feared it happened, for he was
murthered; the queane brought all to light, and those papers in his
deske shewed the whole manner of the former murther of Keyt, whereupon
the Harrises were indited, found gilty, and adjudged to be hanged. The
former tooke it upon his death that he was guiltles of the latter
murder, but the other confest it as he was tumbling from the ladder.

AT PAULES CROSSE.

One BARLOWE, a beardless man of Pembroke Hall in Cambridge.

[Sidenote: fo. 86^b.]

After his prayer and before he came to his text, he made a large
exordium after this fashion; that yf Paule sayth of himselfe that he was
amongst the Corinthians in weaknes, in feare and trembling, much more
might he say the like of himselfe: whoe was weake in deliveraunce and
methode, &c. Yet he entreated they would not heare, as some say they
will heare, the man, but that they would regard the matter. Of all parts
of Scripture the book of the Preacher may seeme most befitting a
preacher, wherein is lively depainted the vanity of the world and all
things therein: wherof at this time he intended to speake, but not out
of the Preacher, but out of the words of St. Paule, and those were
written in the viiith chapter to the Romans, the 19, 20, 21, and 22
verses. His distribution of this text, or rather context as he called
it, because he said it was like Christs garment soe wouen togither that
it might not be parted, was into five points: 1. That the creature is
subject to vanity, v. 20. 2d. The reason of this subjection, by reason
of him which hath subdued it vnder hope. 3. That the creatures shall be
delivered, and hope for deliveraunce. 4. The effects of the subjection
to vanity: every creature groneth with us, v. 22. 5. The effect of hope,
the feruent desyre of the creature wayteth, &c. v. 19. He said this
place of Scripture is accounted the hardest in all Paules Epistles. For
the first, that the creature is subject to vanity, he interpreted the
word by "creature" is ment, in this place, the heavens, the elements,
all things made of them, or conteyned in them, except men and angells.
The vanity of the creature is in two points, 1. In the frustracion of

and the service of good men, for whom he made them. The 2d vanity, that
they are subject to corruption, not of annihilacion of matter, but
decaying in force and virtue.

The creatures, yf they had their owne will, would destroy the wicked and
save the godly alone. As the earth would open hir mouth and swallowe
them quicke, as it did Datham and Abiram. The lyons would devoure them,
as it did the accusers of Daniel, but shutt their mouths against the
innocent. The fier would burne them, as it did those which cast the
three children into the furnace. It hath bin obserued that as well the
influence of the heauens as the fertilnes of the earth is decayed, and
that the whole world is the worse for wearing, the heavens themselves
growing old as doth a garment.

2. God hath subdued the creature, for it is he alone that maketh the
sunne shine, and powreth downe rayne as well upon the good as the bad,
&c. and the reason of this subjection is the synn of man; for all these
being created for mans vse, when he synned they were punished with him.

We may truely say that the afflictions of these tymes wherein we liue
are not worthy the glory, for these are non, wee living in abundant
prosperity and peace, but tymes of persecution may come, wherein these
may be comfortable arguments; and, he said, that for ought he could see

By primority of birth Kaine had the inheritaunce of land, and the rule
of his brother Habel. He was Lord over him, and did domineer, a title
that was used, and is allowed by all to temporall persons, but by some
fantasticall curious heads of late denied to the ecclesiasticall
governors. A sort of busie superstitious and factious braines there be,
and some in this city, that are afrayed of they know not what, would
haue something if they could tell what it ment: they are like a goose
that stoopes when it comes in at a barne dore, though it knowe not
wherefore. These forsoothe crye into the eares of those auditors that
like and followe them, that there must be noe such title as Lord given
to anie ecclesiastike person, because Christ sayd to his disciples; "Be
ye not called Lord," and "The rulers of the Gentiles beare dominacion,
but you not soe," Math. xx. Indeede the Scripture talkes after that
manner, but not that meaning, and at last they come out with a place,
and tell the people they read, Luke xxii. 25. "The kings of the Gentiles
be called Gracious Lords, but ye shall not be soe:" and this they say
cuts home indeede, just as a leaden sawe; for they may well say they
reade so: but I dare say they cannot reade soe in the Scripture, they
bely Christ when they say he said soe; he never spake those words; it
is a punishment for our synnes that wee cannot reade right in this age.
They are unlearned malitious that reade soe. The word in the text
originall is [Greek: euergetai], derived of the particle [Greek: eu],
good, and the other verbe [Greek: ergazomai] to worke; in Latin they are
called Benefactores, we may call them Good Workers, a title which the
kings of the Southerne Nations, those which Daniel describeth to be the
kingdome that stands upon black legges, when they had done some little
good to their state, they would arrogate; soe Ptolome Euergetes, and soe
it is forbidden by way of arrogancy for good deedes: because the glory
must be ascribed to God.

And by their reason they might as well deny the name of Maister, and
Father, for both are forbidden, as well as the other, and soe they might
quickly be amongst the Anabaptists, and overturne all difference and
jurisdicion. Lord is a name sometyme of place, and sometyme of grace;
and soe the ecclesiastike may haue it as well as the temporall, for to
the temporall it is a name of place onely, but the ecclesiasticall by
their merit may haue it of grace. Neither is it soe strange a title;
Jacob useth it to his brother Esau, and the prophet Isay takes it, my
Lord, Adoni; Christ acknowledged the name, and some of the Apostles did
not refuse it.

"Then Kain spake to Habell;" it is not sett downe what he said: yet some
have adventured to say that he said _Transeamus in campos_, but
whatsoever it was it is not here mentioned, but left to be conceived, as
in iii. Gen. v. 22, least he put forth his hand [and] take alsoe of the
tree of lyfe: it is left what he resolved. Not that yf Adam had tasted
of the tree of lyfe that he should have liued for ever, noe more then he
that receives the Sacrament vnworthily shall be a member of Christs
body, but that was spoken _ironice_.

It is like he spake fayre words, being in the house in presence of his
father and mother, and that he used dissembling flattering speaches to
draw him to such a place where he might with aduantage execute his
purpose. A common practise in this world, and an old one, you see, a
Machiuilian tricke. They will match the diuel in this age, to carry
fayre countenaunce to him whome they meane to overthrowe; to glose and
insinuate, to offer hart roote and all, till he may take him at such a
vantage that he may cutt his throate or breake his necke, a familiar
fashion amongst the nobility in Court, not altogither unusuall amongst
the Clergy.

And when they were in the feild Kain rose up against his brother and
killed him, a pittifull and a wonderfull matter, will some say, that God
will suffer the wicked thus to murther the good; pittifull indeed, but
not wonderfull, for the synnes of the best have deserved greater
punishment.

Murder an auncient synn, the first open offence after the fall that was

"Where is Habel thy brother?" The Lord careth for the righteous.

"Whoe answered, I cannot tell." He flaps God in the mouth with a ly at

_Out of a poeme intituled The Tragicall History of_ MARY QUEEN OF SCOTTS
_and Dowager of Fraunce._[145] _Hir Ghost to Baldwyne._

    [Footnote 145: The poem from which the following lines were
    extracted remained unpublished for two centuries after the time of
    our Diarist. It was written in the style of the Mirror for
    Magistrates, and was clearly intended for insertion in some
    subsequent edition of that popular work, but there were obvious
    reasons connected with its subject-matter which would operate
    against its publication in the reign of Elizabeth and in that of her
    successor, and after that time the Mirror had fallen out of fashion,
    another style of poetry had come into vogue, Queen Mary and her
    sorrows had lost for a time their hold upon the public mind, and the
    Tragicall History was consequently entirely lost sight of. In 1810
    it was found by Mr. John Fry in a manuscript belonging to a
    gentleman named Fryer, and was published by Mr. Fry in a volume
    entitled "The Legend of Mary Queen of Scots and other ancient Poems,
    now first published from MSS. of the 16th century." (Lond. 8vo.) At
    the end of the principal poem there occurs in Mr. Fryer's MS. the
    date of the 10th July 1601, with the name of the supposed and, in
    all probability, the real author, Thomas Wenman. He is thought to be
    the person of those names who contributed one of the commendatory
    poems prefixed to the second part of Browne's Britannia's Pastorals,
    published in 1616. Wenman was of the Inner Temple. He was Public
    Orator of the University of Oxford from 1594 to 1597 (Wood's Athenae,
    ii. 365. Fasti, i. 251. Hardy's Le Neve, iii. 534,) and, as may be
    gathered from Mr. Fryer's MS., was a Roman Catholic. We doubted
    whether the extracts given by our Diarist should be printed, the
    whole poem having been included in the volume edited by Mr. Fry, but
    after consideration we have come to the conclusion that it was best
    to do so: 1, Because Mr. Fry's impression was an extremely small
    one, and the poem is consequently very little known, even to
    poetical antiquaries; and 2, Because many of the lines here quoted
    supply other readings, and in many cases correct obvious
    misreadings, in the edition of Mr. Fry. The tenour of the writer's
    opinions upon the moot points of Queen Mary's history may be
    gathered even from our Diarist's disjointed extracts. The numbers
    added in the margin within brackets refer to the stanzas of the poem
    as printed by Mr. Fry.]

AT THE TEMPLE CHURCHE, DR. ABBOTTES,[156] Deane of [Winchester.[157]]

    [Footnote 156: Dr. George Abbot, Dean of Winchester, from 1599-1600
    to 1609, when he was appointed Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, and
    in 1611 translated to the see of Canterbury. (Hardy's Le Neve, i.
    26, 556, iii. 22.)]

    [Footnote 157: Blank in original.]

His text, 59 of Isay, v. 12: "For our tresspasses are many before thee,
and our synnes testify against us, for our trespasses are with us, and
we knowe our iniquities."

He began with a commendacion of this prophet for the most eloquent and
evangelique, in soe much that St. Jerome said he might rather be placed
amongst the Evangelists then the Prophets.

All men are synners. "Our trespasses." When Christ taught his disciples
to pray, it was one peticion, "Forgive us our trespasses:" to lett them
knowe that they were his chosen disciples, yet they were not without
synn.

Some may say they have liued _sine crimine, sine querela, sed nemo
absque peccato_.

Hence we must learne not to be presumptuous, but to worke out our
salvacion with feare and trembling, since all are synners. 2. Not to
despayre, since the best haue synned.

Our synnes are before God, his eyes are 10,000 tymes brighter then the
sunne, nothing hid from his knowledge. Synne is like a smoke, like fyre,
it mounteth upward, and comes even before God to accuse us; it is like a
serpent in our bosome, still ready to sting us; it is the diuels
daughter. A woman hath hir paynes in travaile and delivery, but
rejoyceth when she seeth a child is borne; but the birth of synn is of a
contrary fashion; for all the pleasure [is] in the bringing forth, but
when it is finished and brought forth, it tormenteth us continually;
they haunt us like the tragicall furies.

In the afternoone, MR. CLAPHAM; his text, Math. xxiv. 15.


"Lett him that readeth consider it." He said this chapter is not to be
understoode of doomesday, but of the destruction of Jerusalem; and that
the 28 v. "Wheresoever the dead carcase is, thither doe the eagles
resort," cannot be applied to the resurrection and congregacion of the
saints into state of glory with Christ, as some notes interpret, but of
the gathering togither of Christes people in the kingdome of grace: for
Christ in his kingdome of glory cannot be sayd a carcase, but nowe he
may, because he is crucified. And the 29 v. "The sunne shall be
darkened, and the moone shall not give hir light, and the stars shall
fall from heaven," he expounded thus, That the temporall and
ecclesiasticall state of the Jewes in Jerusalem, and the starres, i. e.
their magistrates, shall loose their authority.

He expounded the opening the seven seales in the Revelacion to have
reference to sundry tymes, and the 6. to the destruction of Jerusalem. 7
tymes 7 makes a weeke of yeares, the Jewes true Jubilee, wherein 7
trumpets should be blowne.

    through many editions and was translated into the principal
    languages of Europe.]

The Revelacion might be better understood if men would better studye it;
and that it may be understood, and hath good use, he alledged the word,
1. 3. "Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the wordes of this
prophesy, and keepe those thinges which are written therein;" which were

Towards the end of his sermon he told his auditory howe it had bin
bruited abroade, as he thought by some Atheists or Papists whose profest
enemy he is, that this last weeke he had hanged himselfe, but some of
his friends, he said, would not believe it, but said some other had done
it; yet others that like him not for some opinion, said it was noe
marvaile yf he hanged himselfe, for he had bin possest of the diuel a
good while, "but I thinke rather," said he, "they were possessed that
said soe, and yet not soe possessed as some hold possession now a dayes,
that is essentially," and here he shewed his opinion that there can be
noe essentiall possession: 1. Because the diuel can effect as much
without entering into the person as yf he were essentially in him, and
then it is more then needes. 2. Because there cannot be assigned anie
proper token or signe to knowe that anie is essentially possessed. Which
signe must be apparent in all such as are soe possessed, and not in anie
others. This opinion of his, he said, he would hold till he sawe better
reason to the contrary.

In his sermon he told a tale of the Jewes Thalmud, which, he said, was

Rabbi Haley had conference with Elias in a caue, and would knowe of
Elias when Messias should come. Elias told him, Goe aske of the Messias
himselfe. Rabbi Haley required where the Messias might be found. Elias
told him he should find him at Rome gates amongst the poore; a verry
scoffe and a flout, he thought, to the Papists, to shewe that Christ
neuer came within their city, but they kept him out of dores, and that
he was not amongst their Cardinals, but the beggars, &c.

glorified him." He spake much of humility. _Melior est peccator humilis,
quam superbus justus. Peccare non potest nisi superbus, nec penitere
nisi humilis._ He first dilated of three meanes to knowe God; by his
greatnes, by the prophets in the old, by his sonne in the newe
Testament. Against pride in beauty; the diuel playes the sophister
whiles he perswades women to paint that they may seeme fayrer than they
are; which painting being discovered, makes them to be thought fouler
than they are. Pride in apparell is pride of our shame, for it was made
to cover it, and as yf one should embroyder a sheete wherein he had done
pennaunce, and shewe it in bragging manner. It is said by some that St.
John Baptist for his humility is rewarded with the place which the diuel
lost for his pride.

He spake against duellisme, or single combat, and said that yf two goe
into the field with purpose to fight an the one be slayne, he is a
murderour of himselfe. He exhorted the judges to severity, telling them
that there is more incouragement taken by one that escapes the

he confesse, and when his confession comes to late he may confesse and
be hanged to, well enough. For repentant confession must come while
grace is offered, while it is called to-day. God deales as the debtor
which tenders his money till sunne goe downe. When night is come, up
goes his money and a fig for his creditor. Yf men take not tyme while
grace is offered, but delay till the sunne of grace be gonne downe,
there remaines nothing but horrible desperat reprobacion. A vagabond; an
excommunicate person is a vagabond, turned out of the society of Gods
Churche both here in earth, and in heaven too, yf it were done by the

hast obedient subjects, thou hast sheepe, thou hast a scepter, thou hast
a crooke; thy fold is thy counsell chamber, and the greene field thy
flourishing pallace. Thy companions are the sunne, the moone, and the
stars, of whom thou makest continuall use, and from the vieue of their

then a theife by profession," said the Lord, "and yet yf thou beest a
theife thou art but a prettie little one. But, sirra, you rogue, what

said the Lord. Soe leaving Hill when he could not force him to confesse,
he went to the accuser, and told him he must not come and trouble him

Upon one Sunday this moneth DR. HOLLAND, Professor at Oxeford,[168] made
a sermon at Paules Crosse, his text, Luke xii. v. 13, 14, &c.

    [Footnote 168: Dr. Thomas Holland, Fellow of Balliol College, and

"Take heede of covetousnes, for though a man have abundaunce, his life
standeth not in riches." 2 parts; a caveat. 2. the reason. The reason by
a negative, 1. Mans lyfe not in abundance. 2. by a similitude. He noted
a difference between the Syriack and the Greeke. The Syriac sayth Christ
spake to his disciples; the Greeke to the brethren that strove for the
inheritaunce.

In the caveat, considered 1. the giver, Christ; 2. the brevity; 3. the
occasion, the falling out of brethren.

All that followe Christ are his disciples.

The giver is Christ, which is Amen, _verax_, omniscient, he that knowes
the waye of the serpent upon the stone, of an arrowe in the ayre, and a
ship in the sea. _Multa habent auctoritatem propter dicentem._ He can
tell us _latet anguis in herba_. The two eyes of the lambe a great
watchman to tell us the danger of synn, that it hath the face of a
woman, but the sting of a scorpion.

[Sidenote: fo. 104^b.]

Brevitye. One word of Christ a whole sermon--the ten commaundments are
called but ten words, Deut. iv. 13. The whole have but one word, Love,
of God and our neighbour, [Greek: o on, o ei, o erchomenos, a] and
[Greek: o]. One word of God overthrewe the whole kingdome of Assyria.
Adams synn was the breach but of one commaundement, yet condemned the
whole world. Relligion is one, though questions be infinit, yet all must
be determined _per unum verbum domini scriptum_. _Verbum indicabit_, all
must be resolved _per primam veritatem_. Our soule can never be quiet
till it be resolved by the word of God. Neither can wee have any
perfection till wee have a seed of God.

Some have gone about to shewe the truth of relligion by casting out
divels. David must come out with his two stones, the Old and the Newe
Testament, before Goliah can be slayne.

He would not speake against the good use of riches. _Divitiae nec
putentur mala, quia dantur bonis; neque bona, quia conferuntur malis._
Though the soule neede none of these goods of riches, yet the body doth,
_propter victum et vestitum_, and therefore we pray, _Da nobis hodie
panem nostrum quotidianum_. God is the author of them, and soe, being
the gifts of God, they cannot be evil in their nature. Diverse virtues
followe and depend upon riches; as magnificence, munificence, &c.; hence
have these goodly churches beene builded, famous colledges found[ed],
warrs maynteyned, &c. The use of riches is to serve our owne necessity,
Gods glory; to doe good to the poore, to lend to the needy, to reward
the virtuous, to make frend of, &c. Yet the gift cannot merrit, for yf I
give all that I have, yet yf I want charitie, &c. Yet _facta in fide
Mediatoris_, they shall not want a reward. "Come ye blessed of my
Father, when I was naked you clothed me," &c. The abuse of riches is
covetousnes. Covetousnes is an Hydra with seven heades, the diuel is the
author of it. He tempted Christ with riches, when he shewed him [Greek:
doxan], the glory of the world; the diuel could make shewes, he was a
cunning juggler.

The second head, the name, which is an ill name, to covet house, land,
&c. allways taken in the ill part; _avaritia_, in Latin, _aviditas
aeris_, [Greek: philargyria]; not a good name amongst them all.

3. The daughters of covetousnes: 1. _Rapina_, robbery. 2. [Greek:
philargyria]. 3. _Oppressio._ 4. _Furtum._ 5. _Homicidium._ 6.
_Proditio._ 7. _Fallacia._ 8. _Mendacia._ 9. _Obduratio._ Whereof more
at this day then the Bishop of Constance burnt poore people in a barne
which came for a dole. 10. _Usuria._ This rangeth abroad over the whole
land. 11. Bribery. 12. _Symonia_, Lady Symonie, a shameles on. 13.
_Sacrilegium._ The end _Superbia_, which conteines all, and holds all
things to base for himselfe.

Fourth head, the effects of covetousnes: 1. Hatred. 2. Misery. 3.
Contempt. 4. Forgetfulnes of God. 5. _Suffocatio_, sorrowe. 6. Danger,
death of body and soule; howe many have bin slayne for riches, or dyed
in them.

Fifth head, it is the roote of all evill. 1 Tim. vi. 10; it is an euill
of generality. Some nations are sicke but of one vice; but he that hath
this, hath all; it is hardly cured, it growes by continuance, _peccatum
clamans_, it is _maxime inimicum Deo_, for hee gave all by creacion to
all equally, but this strives to drawe all to it selfe most unequally.
Of such a man it is sayd _abstulit a pauperibus, congregavit, et manet
in aeternum ejus infamia_.

disquieting kinde of thirst; to leaches, which sucke till they burst.

7. The end, he gathers he knowes not for whom; the reason, mans life
consists not in the abundance of riches, 1. Because both when wee came
into the world, though wee were naked, yet wee then lived, and before
that too. 2. Wee shall carry nothing away with us when we dye, yet our
soules shall live. 3. They cannot deliver us from death.

Riches are incertayne, and therefore Eschines compares them to Euripus,
which ebbes and flowes oftentymes in a day. An other says they are
winged, because the[y] passe away soe swiftly; and Fortune hir selfe is
allways painted upon a wheeling stone, to note the inconstancy of
riches; and certaine it is that, at last, yf they part not from us, wee
must part from them.

The parable. A riche man, though he be riche, yet he must dye; for he is
but a man. God would have some riche, some poore, for distinction sake,
and the mutuall exercise of liberality and patience, whereby the opinion
of the Anabaptists is easily confuted, whoe would have all things alike
common; _admirabilis concatenatio_ in the order of things and states.
God made noe miraculous provision for his disciples, therefore there
ought to be an ordinary provision for the ministery. As the people love
the ministers for their spirituall blessings, soe the ministers love the
people for their temporall commodities. The order of professions. 1.
Relligion. 2. Husbandry. 3. Merchandise. 4. Souldiery.

Abuse _in acquirendo, concupiscendo, consumendo_.

"I will pull doune;" surely he was a man of this age, pul downe
colledges, churches, cyties, kingdomes; every one cryes "Downe with
Jerusalem!" An easy matter to pull downe that which was in building
forty yeares; he will build it agen, soe will not many an other doe.

The foole when his owne belly is full thinkes all the worlde hath
enoughe. "Eate soule! drinke soule!" a hog may say as much. I will pull
downe, I will build; here is all "I," nothing but himselfe. Presumption
that he shall enjoy all; whence he noted his infidelity, security,
carnality, [Greek: eutrapelia].

Of the soule. The soule is the image of God, _Christi redempta sanguine,
haeres cum angelis, capax caelestis beatitudinis, simplex, immortalis,
incorporea_. It useth _organa_, instruments. God giveth, not man
begge[tte]th it. 21 Exod. 22. _Creando infunditur, infundendo creatur._
God is the father of soules, and the soule returneth to God that gave
it; Ecclesiastes. _Anima imago Dei, in justitia et dominio._

Relligion of the Turk more towards their Alcoran then our[s] to the
Scripture; speake but against that there it is death. He that
dishonoureth his father, or disobeyeth the magistrat, every where
punished, but for Gods dishonour fewe take care or vengeance.

This thought he spake to himselfe, but God puls him by the sleeve, and
calls him by his name, "Thou foole!"

other parts adjoining instantly of merchants became good men of warr,
and tooke our merchants fleete and forced them to lend 50,000_l._, which
was never repayd. Yet when they had served their turnes for that
extremity, and after divers complaints made by our merchants to our

desist from those courses, they presently retyred themselves on a

Notes of a sermon upon the xv. ch. to the Corinth, verse 22.

"As in Adam all dye, soe in Christ shall all men be made alive." The
judgement of the first disobedience was death. And in truth, God could
doe noe lesse, unlesse he would be unjust, for as in wisdome he had
ordayned that man should dye when he tasted the fruit of the forbidden
tree, soe in justice he was to execute what in wisdom he had decreed.

Christ was like Adam in his preheminence, in being the cheife and having
goverment over all creature[s]. But yet unlike in this that Adam was the
cause of death, but Christ is the cause of lyfe unto all that beleeve in
him. There is a tyme for all to dye: and this act of dying is done by
us, and upon us. It is a sentence which comprehendeth all, though all
apprehend not it. Adam was one before all, one ouer all, and all in one,
by whose synn all taynted; soe Christ, by whom all saved. 1 Tim. ii. 4.
Man is the principall cause in the course of generacion, but woman was

Notes of a Sermon upon Matthew v. 17.

"Thinke not that I am come to destroy the lawe, or the prophets: I am
not come to destroy them, but to fullfill them." The best could not live
free from slaunders, as Nehemias was charged to have rebelled, &c. and
Christ himselfe could not escape the malitious censures of the wicked.
When he cured the sicke of the palsy saying, Thy synnes bee forgiven
thee, these whispered in their hartes, and called that speache
blasphemy. When he disposs[ess]ed the man that was vexed with a deuil,
they said he cast out deuils by Beelzebub the prince of the deuils. When
he suffered for us they sayd he was plagued for his owne offences. But
Augustine sayth well of these men; "_Hoc facilius homo suspicatur in
altero, quod sentit in seipso._"

The lawe stretcht noe further then the outward action, but Christ layes
it to the secret thought. Synnes in our thoughtes are like a snake in

from our garments, lest yf wee be once sett on fyre with them all our
teares shall not quenche them. The divel puts synn in our thoughtes, as

chaplens preache, and to be assured whether the Queene were living or

out of the Psalme [cxvi. 18, 19] "Nowe will I pay my vowes unto the Lord
in the middest of the congregacion," &c. It was a verry learned,
eloquent, relligious, and moving sermon: his prayer, both in the

The doctrine was concerning vowes, which were growne in contempt and
hatred, because the Jews of old and the Papists of later tymes have used
them, whereas the thing itselfe, in its owne nature, is reasonable and
commendable. Wee owe all that wee have, that wee are, vnto God; and all
that wee can doe is but our bounden duty, yet those offices may seeme to
please him best, and be most gratefull, [in] which even besydes those
dutyes which he requires; wee doe enter of our owne will as it were into
a newe, a neere[r] bond. And he defined it to be a promise made unto
God, to performe some service in such manner as we are not otherwise
bound by duty to performe. It must be made to God, soe differs from
other promises; it must be voluntary, and soe it differs from required
dutyes; it must be deliberate, which takes away rashnes; it must be of
thinges possible within our power, of things that are good, and tending
to Gods glory and our bettering. And they are generally either
_penitentiae_, of a strict course of life, in punishing our synfull
bodies by sparer dyet, &c.; _gratitudinis_, for benefits received;
_amicitiae_, testimonyes of our love, _dona_.

heare the Arch[bishop] speake of hope of hir longer lyfe, but when he
prayed or spake of Heaven, and those ioyes, shee would hug his hand, &c.
It seemes shee might have lived yf she would have used meanes; but shee
would not be persuaded, and princes must not be forced. Hir physicians
said shee had a body of a firme and perfect constitucion, likely to have
liued many yeares. A royall Maiesty is noe priviledge against death.

This morning about three at clocke hir Majestic departed this lyfe,
mildly like a lambe, easily like a ripe apple from the tree, _cum leue
quadam febre, absque gemitu_. Dr. Parry told me that he was present, and
sent his prayers before hir soule; and I doubt not but shee is amongst
the royall saints in Heaven in eternall joyes.


About ten at clocke the Counsel and diverse noblemen having bin a while
in consultacion, proclaymed James the 6, King of Scots, the King of
England, Fraunce, and Irland, beginning at Whitehall gates; where Sir
Robert Cecile reade the proclamacion which he carries in his hand, and
after reade againe in Cheapside. Many noblemen, lords spirituell and
temporell, knights, five trumpets, many heraulds. The gates at Ludgate
and portcullis were shutt and downe, by the Lord Maiors commaund, who
was there present, with the Aldermen, &c. and untill he had a token
besyde promise, the Lord Treasurers George, that they would proclayme
the King of Scots King of England, he would not open.

Upon the death of a King or Queene in England the Lord Maior of London

gate and street, day and night, by housholders, to prevent garboiles:
which God be thanked were more feared then perceived.

The proclamacion was heard with greate expectacion and silent joye, noe
great shouting. I thinke the sorrowe for hir Majesties departure was soe
deep in many hearts they could not soe suddenly showe anie great joy,
though it could not be lesse then exceeding greate for the succession
of soe worthy a king. And at night they shewed it by bonefires, and
ringing. Noe tumult, noe contradicion, noe disorder in the city; every
man went about his busines, as readylie, as peaceably, as securely, as
though there had bin noe change, nor any newes ever heard of
competitors. God be thanked, our king hath his right! _Magna veritas et

Doubtles there was grave wise counsell and deliberacion in fact; _sed
factum est hoc a Domino_, we must needes confessse, and I hope wee may
truly say, _nobis parta quies_. The people is full of expectacion, and
great with hope of his worthines, of our nations future greatnes; every
one promises himselfe a share in some famous action to be hereafter
performed for his prince and country. They assure themselves of the
continuance of our Church goverment and doctrine. Their talke is of
advauncement of the nobility, of the subsidies and fifteenes taxed in
the Queenes tyme; howe much indebted shee died to the Commons,
notwithstanding all those charges layed upon them. They halfe despayre
of payment of their privey seales, sent in Sir William Ceciles tyme;
they will not assure themselves of the lone. One wishes the Earl of
Southampton and others were pardoned and at liberty; others could be
content some men of great place might pay the Queenes debts, because
they beleeve they gathered enough under hir. But all long to see our
newe king.

This evening prayer at Paules the King was publikely prayed for in forme

At White Hall;

DR. THOMPSON, Deane of Windsore, whoe at thys tyme attendes still with
Dr. Parry as Chaplein, was by course to have preached this day, but DR.
KING was appointed and performed that duty.


His text was the Gospell for this day, the xi. of Luke and the 14.
verse, and soe forward. He prayed for the King, that as God had given
him an head of gold, soe hee would give him a golden brest, golden legs
and feet alsoe; that as he had a peaceable and quiet entrance, soe he
would graunt him a wise and happie goverment, and a blessed ending,
whensoever he should take him from us. That it would please God to laye
his roote soe deepe that he may flourishe a long tyme, and his braunches
never fayle. The summe of his text in these parts; 1. A diuel cast out.
2. The dumb speake. 3. The multitude wonder. 4. The Scribes and
Pharisees slander. 5. Christ confuteth. 6. A woman confesseth. The ende
of Christs comming was to dissolve the workes of the diuel, whereof
possession was not the meanest. Can there be a greater then to take the
temple of the Holy Ghost, and make it the sell and shrine of the diuels
image?

_Non requiritur intelligendi vivacitas, sed credendi simplicitas._

_Indocti coelum rapiunt, dum nos cum doctrina nostra trudimur in
infernum._

The workes of Christ, his miracles, were manifest, _posuit in sole
tabernaculum_: he cast out a diuel, they sawe it, they could not deny
it, but then, what malice could, they deprave the fact or diminishe and
eclipse his glory.

_Judei signum quaerunt._ Julian cals it the rusticity of fayth, as though
none but the simple rude multitude beleeve.

[Sidenote: fo. 114.

27 Mar. 1603.]

_Invidia non quaerit quid dicat, sed tantum ut dicat._

The envious and malitious live onely in contradiction, like the bettle
in dung and filthines. They said not that Christ could not cast out a
diuel, and soe denyed his power, which is a synn against the Holy Ghost,
but they said himselfe was possessed, nay more that he was Belzeebub.

Beelzebub signifies an idoll of flyes: because there was soe much bloud
spilt in sacrifice before it that many flyes bred and lived upon it.

Christ confuted them by four reasons: 1. From autority; a maxime and
rule in all policy, that a kingdome divided against itselfe cannot
stand. 2. From example. By whom doe your children, his apostles and
disciples he meanes, cast them out? Yf they doe it by the finger of God,
then must I, except the same thing be not the same, yf other persons doe
it. Atticus and Ru ... (_idem non idem si non per eundem_) unles they
will allowe the thing and condemne the person. But he said, _testes mei
judices vestri_. 3. From a similitude of a stronge and a stronger man,
two warlike men, yf one keepe possession, he must be stronger that puts
him out: soe he must be greater than the diuel that can cast him out. 4.
From the contrary; the repugnancy betwixt Christ and the diuel.

[Sidenote: fo. 114^b.

27 Mar. 1603.]

He insisted most upon his first reason, of intestine discord: which he
said is like a consumption; as yf the head should pull out the eye, or
the mouth refuse to eate because the belly receives it, &c. This is that
plague that Aegypt shall fight against Aegypt, brother against brother.
In the 11 of Zacharia there are two staves mentioned, the one of beauty,
the other of bonds; it is a grevous plague which is there threatened,
_dissolvam germanitatem eorum_, their brotherhood of Judah and Israel.
Ephraim against Manasse and Manasse against Ephraim, two tribes of the
same family: the incomparable miseryes of Jerusalem by intestine
sedicion. _Auxilia humana firma consensus facit._ Agesilaus shewed his
armed men, a mind in consent for defence of the city, and said, _Hij
sunt muri Spartae, scutum haerens scuto, galeae galea, atque viro vir_.
Friends at discord are most deadly enimyes, and those thinges which
before were _ligamenta amoris_ became then _incitamenta furoris_. The
greatest wrongs are most eagerly pursued; such are commonly the causes
for which frends fall out. _Quasi musto inebrientur sanguine._

Even the diuel must have his due; it was commendable that a legion of
them could dwell togither in one man without discord amongst themselves;
scarse a few in one house but some jar betwixt them. Yet their concord
was not _ex amicitia, sed ex communi malitia_, like Herod and Pilat.
_Aliquod bonum absque malo, sed nullum malum absque aliquo bono_, even
in the diuels their essence and their order is good.

There is a tyme to gather, said he, and a tyme to scatter, but he had
scattered what he had scarce any tyme to gather; his comming up to this
place being _tanquam fungus e terra_, an evening and a morning being the
whole tyme allotted for meditacion, and disposicion.

Wee may not be unmindefull of our late Soverayne whom God hath called to

The finger of the Spirit directed the Churche, and the order of [the]
Church leads me (said he) to the choise of this text, being the Gospell
for this day. There are that have slandered, but they are Scribes and
Pharisees; and that being the worst part of this text, he would passe
over it. There were feares and foretellinges of miseries like to fall
upon us at these times, but blessed be the God of peace, that hath
settled peace amongst us. Blessed be the God of truth that his kingdome
came unto us long since, and I hope shall continue even till the comming
of Christ; and blessed be the father of lights, that wee see the truth,
and be not scattered.

The miracle of dispossession. Wee have seene the exile of the diuel out
of our country, his legends, his false miracles, exorcismes,
superstitions, &c. and lett him goe walking through dry places, wee are
watered with heavenly deawe, and wee hope he shall never returne againe;
but the favour of God towards us shall be like the kindenes of Ruth,
more at the latter end than it was at the beginning.

Our State hath sustayned some division of late. "I meane not," sayd he,

as of the body and soule, of the vine and the branches, of the husband
and the wife, of the head and the body. The prince and the land hath bin

This Gospell makes mention of an excellent woman that sang not to hir
selfe and hir muses, but went amongst the multitude, and blessed an
other woman more excellent then hirselfe; yet soe blessed hir as a
mother for hir babes sake. Soe there are two excellent women, one that
bare Christ and an other that blessed Christ; to these may wee joyne a
thrid that bare and blessed him both. Shee bare him in hir heart as a
wombe, shee conceived him in fayth, shee brought him forth in
aboundaunce of good workes, and nurst him with favors and protection:
shee blessed him in the middest of a froward and wicked generacion, when
the bulls of Bazan roared, and the unholie league, and bound themselves
with oathes and cursings against the Lord and his annoynted. "And am I
entred into hir prayses," said he; "and nowe is the tyme of prayse, for
prayse none before their death; and then _gratissima laudis actio cum
nullus fingendi aut assentandi locus relinguitur_. Yet such prayses are
but like a messe of meate sett upon a dead mans grave which he cannot
tast, or like a light behind a mans back which cannot him direct." He
would say little, _non quod ingratus, sed quod oppressus multitudine et
magnitudine rerum dicendarum_. Onely he would say that hir government
had bin soe clement, temperat and godly, that he may say _sic imbuti
sumus, non possumus nisi optimum ferre_. Those which in Theodosius the
Emperours tyme went to Rome called their travel _felix peregrinatio_,
because they had seen Rome, they had seen Theodosius, they had seene
Rome and Theodosius togither; soe have and may strangers that have bin
to visit our kingdome thinke them selves happie that [they] had seene
England and Queen Elizabeth, and England and Queene Elizabeth togither.
But there are panegyricks provided for hir, faythfully registred, and as
she merited. Shee was _preteritis melior_, better then those which went
before hir, and may be a precedent to those that shall followe hir; the
taking hir from us was a great division, but God hath sowed it up
againe; it was a grevious sore, but God hath healed it; he hath given us
a worthy successor, a sonne of the nobles; one that is fleshe of our
fleshe. God seemes to say unto us, "Open thy mouth wide and I will fill
it with aboundant blessing;" he may say as he did to his vine, "what
should I have done that I have not done unto thee, O England?" Noe
vacancy, noe interregnum, noe interruption of goverment, as in Rome
an[d] other places, where in such tymes the prisons fly open, &c. but a
quiet, a peaceable, and present succession of such a King, _quem populus
et proceres voce petebant_; the best wished and the onely agreed upon.
The Lord from his holy sanctuary blesse him in his throne! It was noe
shame for Solomon to walke in the wayes of his father David; neither can
it be a dishonour for our King to walke in the steps of his mother and
predecessor. Lett the foster-sonne and sonnes sonne continue their
glory, grace, and dignity, and never lett him want one of his seede to
sit upon his seate.

Then to the nobles for their wise menaging those greate affayres,
"_Utinam retribuat Dominus_," said he, "and, as Nehemias prayed for
himselfe, 'Remember them, O God! in goodnes.' Your peace," said he,
"continued ours, and long may you continue in firme alledgeance to doe
your prince and country service in wisdome, honour, and piety." And this
is noe _detractio, sed attractio; impius in tenebris latet_, he holds
his peace, but Lord open thou our lips, and our mouth shall shewe forth
thy prayse; _Paratum est cor meum_, My heart is ready, my heart is
ready, &c.

AT WHITE HALL.

DR. MONTAGUE, Master of Sydney Colledge in Cambridge, made a sermon; his
text Matt xviii. 11. "The Sonne of Man came to save that which was
lost."

In his prayer: "Wee give ourselves to synn, without restraint in our
conscience before, or remorse after." He considered 3 points: 1. The
stile of Christ; the Sonne of Man. 2. To whom he came; to the lost. 3.
The end of his coming; to save. Where men come of an honourable
parentage, or beare an office of dignity, it is their use to stile
themselves in the name of their auncesters, as Solomon the sonne of
David, &c. But where they have none, the Jewes call them Ben Adam, the
sonne of man. Howe happens it then that Christ which is _Salvator
mundi_, [Greek: Soter], the best word that the Greekes have, that he
takes upon him this stile of basenes? For two reasons: 1. Because the
nearer he came to our nature, the neerer he came to our name; first
before the lawe he was called _Semen mulieris_, then _Shilo_, after
_Messias_, and nowe himselfe gives himselfe this name, the Sonne of Man,
by speciall effect changing his name; when he was Silo wee were but
servants, &c.

He layd downe his name to take up ours, that wee might for his sake lay
downe our lives to take up his glory.

[Sidenote: fo. 122.

8 Aprill 1603.]

He would not have his glory upon earth: he would never suffer himselfe
to be called God upon earth, nor suffer his miracles to be blazoned, he
would have his fame spread by the inward persuasion of the spirit not
the outward applause of the mouth. And hence he noted the difference
betwixt the fame of a magistrat and of a minister; for from the outward
action of the magistrat we come to an inward approbacion of his virtue;
but contrary in a minister, from our inward perswasion of his virtue to
the outward approbacion of his actions.

Exinanition [Exaninition] of Christs glory on earth typified in the
auncient Jewish manner of coronacion, and enthronizing their kings, when
they powred a horne of oyle upon his head, to shewe that as the horne
was emptied to annoint him, soe out of his fullnes he should enrich
others. Oyle is taken for grace.

[Sidenote: fo. 122^b.

8 Aprill 1603.]

Second point; to those that were lost. The Rabbins devide all the people
into three sorts, _Sapientes_, such were the Scribes and Pharises; 2.
_Sapientum filij_, such as held nothing for opinion, nor did any thing
for action, but that which was approved by the Pharisees; 3. _Terrae
filij_, the children of the world, publicans and synners, reputed as
lost sheepe: to these Christ came, and for conversing with these he was
obrayded; to teache men what a different course there is in the managing
of heavenly and earthly things. The greate affayres of the world begin
at the Prince, and soe are derived by a long course to the people, but
the matters of heaven begin in the people, and soe rise up to the
Prince. The first newes of Christs birth was brought but to a company of
silly shepheards, from them to a poore city, Bethleem, from thence to
Jerusalem, and soe by calculacion it was neere two yeares before it came
to the Kings eare.

There are two Kingdomes in this world, a temporall and a spirituall or
mysticall, eache needing other. Where the rich feeling their poverty in
spirituell, come to the minister to be furnished in that commodity, and
the minister feeling his wants in the riches of this lyfe, followeth
great men, to be relieved in that necessity. _Communis indigentia est
societatis vinculum_, mutuall necesity is the surcingle of the world.

[Sidenote: fo. 123.

8 Aprill 1603.]

Second reason; Christ came to these, as the fittest to receive his
doctrine, and yet it is clapt in amongst his miracles that the poor
beleeved. The promises of a kingdome in heaven is a greate matter which
greate men according to their course in earth will hardly beleeve can be
effected without greate meanes, and therefore a miracle yf princes
receive Christ. Our Prince did, and our King doth continue this miracle;
for shee did, and he doth, hold and will maintaine the truth of the
Gospell, "and this hath king'd him," said he.

Two conclusions; better to be a lost sheepe in the wild field, then put
up safe in the fold of the Pharisees.

There have bin three great monarchies in the world, the first of Synn,
the second of the Lawe, the third of Grace, and these had severall ends;
the first was death, the next Christ, and the last is lyfe; and these
were attained by severall meanes, for synn brought us to death by
concealment of our faults, the lawe brought us to Christ by knowing our
syn, by revealing our syn, and Christ by his grace leads us to
everlasting lyfe. In each soule those three kingdomes have their
succession yf it be saved. Though the lawe was delivered with thunder,
yet there insued comfort in the first word, "I am thy God." The lawe
like a bason of water with a glas by it, serves to discover, and scower
away the filthines.

[Sidenote: fol. 123^b.

Aprill 1603.]

Second conclusion. Noe syn soe greate that should discourage us from
comminge to Christ. Aesculapius, as the poets faine, dewised more
remedys against poison out of a serpent than any other creature, yet the
serpent more poisonous in it selfe then anie man. Soe from syn. Our
confidence, _i. e._ from the nature of God, whoe regards not soe muche
what a man hath bin, but what he is, and will bee. Whereas the judgment
of man, on the contrary, is ground[ed] upon _vita anteacta_, and
forepassed actions; soe Ananias made conjecture of Paule. God more
delights to pardon the synner, then to punish the synne.

2. From the nature of Christ; more mild and mercyfull than Moses: for
Christ never executed any point of judgment. He is an intercessor, and
shall be our judge: but that tyme is not come, soe our creede notes,
"From thence He shall come to judge." And this seemes to be the reason,
that under the lawe, yf anie strang syn had escaped the hand of the
magistrat, yet it was usually punished by the hand of God: whereas nowe,
yf offences slip the magistrat, they are seldome or neuer revenged from
heaven.

Christ is not soe muche a remedy for easy synns, but even for such
synners as even beginn to stink and rott in them, as Lazarus did in the
grave. Shee that had hir issue 12 yeares was healed with the touch of
his garment, &c. He is more ready to pardon a synner upon repentance
then to punishe him upon perseverance.

3. The end: To save. Christus salvat; solutione debiti et applicatione
remedij. Debitum nostrum 2^x; Obedientiae; Poenae.

Wee must obey the lawe or indure the punishment. Christ by his lyfe hath
payd the dett of our obedience, and by his death had cleered the debt of
our punishment. Both were necessary to our plenary redemption: his life
to ripe age to accomplishe our righteousnes; his passion by death to
meritt of [_sic_] our salvacion. Righteousnes of his lyfe. Merit of his
passion.

[Sidenote: fo. 124.

Aprill 1603.]

[Sidenote: fo. 124^b.

Aprill 1603.]

The applicacion; by taking upon him our syns, and imputing unto us his
righteousnes. In all synn, three things, _culpas_, _reatus_, _poena_,
and the remedy must have something contrary to the malignant quality of
the disease: soe Christ cureth the fault by his obedience, the guilt by
his innocency, and the punishment by his passion; soe by applicacion all
our synns are his. All his righteousnes is become ours. But heere surges
a doubt, howe it comes to passe that synce the imputacion of his merits
makes us righteous, the imputacion of our synn cannot make him synfull.
_Ferrum candens absorbet aquam_, and the drop of our synn cannot infect
the ocean of his innocency; _finiti ad infinitum nulla proportio._ The
applicacion of our syn to him is but a mere imputacion, but his merits,
beside an imputacion, worke in us alsoe an inherent righteousnes. For
applicacion; the commaundments are given in the second person; and the
bible written in fashion of a story, not precepts and rules, because it
is more for practise then speculacion, and God would have us rather good
Christians then good schollers. Without particular applicacion all is
nothinge but like the rude chaos, for before the incubacion of the
Spirit of God, there was noe separacion, noe vilificacion, noe
animacion. In the sacrifice in the old lawe it was noe idle thing that
they were to sprinkle the right eare, the right thombe, and the right
foote too, to shewe the inward affection must be moved by the eare, and
the action by the thomb and the toe.

The Virgin liked the newes well which was brought hir, "but howe shall
this come to passe," quoth shee; soe it is welcome to every one to heere
that he shall be the Sonne of God, but howe shall he knowe that? There
is but thre wa[y]s of knowing himselfe to be the Sonne of God: 1.
_Scientia unionis_, and soe Christ onely knowes himselfe to be the Sonne
of God. 2. _Scientia visionis_, and soe the Saints. 3. _Scientia
revelationis_, and soe every Christian. And this last is twofold, either
by a descendant course, whereby Gods spirit comes downe to us, and this
those knowe which have it. Philosophie sayth every lambe knowes his owne
dame, _non per eundem sonum sed per eundem Spiritum_: as the uniting of
the Father and the Sonne in the Trinity is _per communionem Spiritus_.
"My sheepe heare my voyce," by inward perception. "Did not our harts
glowe within us?" The difference is knowne to them that have it. Samuel,
before he was acquainted with it, thought it had bin the voyce of a man,
but Ely could discerne it. 2. Wee knowe by our Spirit ascending to God:
the Spirit like fyre, still ascendeth, like a steele toucht with the
magnet turnes northward, soe this heavenward. Wee are placed twixt
heaven and earth; like an iron betwixt two loadstones wee incline still
to one of them.

MR. LAYFEILD; his text. "Not preaching ourselves." Noo heretike ever
preached himselfe directly, for they never can be heretikes except they
professt Christ, and such as preach themselves for saviours deny Christ;
but preaching them selves undirectly is when by preaching men stake
their owne glory or advauncement, as the cheifest end of their
preaching. "Labour not for meat;" that is, make not meate the chiefest
end of labour, but the service of God in that vocation, and the benefit
of the State; soe labour in all your trades as yf you laboured for God,
making not the hyer the maine end, though it be an end alsoe.

Every man spends more then he can gett; untill thirty yeare commonly men
doe nothing but spend, and then when they begynn to gaine, yet expenses
runne on with their tyme.

Every manuary trade is called a mystery, because it hath some slight or

carpentour of his owne fortune. The faults of preachers in preaching
themselves and false doctrine, like a physicion that poisoneth his

the father is well pleased. He consider[ed] the subject, "All yee," &c.
the invitacion "Come unto me," and the promise, "I will ease you." "All
yee" is heere specially limited to those that labour and are laden,
which are [have?] greate synnes and feele the waight of them. Noe synn

of Durrham[189] hath tendered his duty in all humility, craving pardon
for his opposicion heretofore, with promise of faythfull service; hath
preacht at Berwike before the King, and said grace at his table twise or
thrise.

    was translated to York. (Hardy's Le Neve, iii. 295.) The opposition
    alluded to was probably connected with Border quarrels.]


The Queene nominated our King for hir successor: for being demaunded
whom shee would haue succede, hir answere was there should noe rascals
sitt in hir seate. "Who then?" "A King," said shee. "What King?" "Of
Scotts," said shee, "for he hath best right, and in the name of God lett
him haue it."


The Papists verry lately put up a supplicacion to the King for a
tolleracion; his aunswre was, Yf there were 40,000 of them in armes
should present such a petition, himselfe would rather dye in the feild
than condiscend to be false to God. Yet seemed he would not use
extremity, yf they continued in duty like subjects.


The Queene would sometymes speake freely of our King, but could not
endure to heare anie other use such language. The Lord of Kenlosse,[190]
a Scott, told our nobles, that they shall receive a verry good, wise,
and relligious King, yf wee can keepe him soe; yf wee mar him not.

    [Footnote 190: Sir Edward Bruce, Lord Bruce of Kinloss, who came to
    England with the Earl of Mar in 1601, ostensibly on a visit of
    congratulation to Queen Elizabeth, but really to effect an
    understanding with Sir Robert Cecil, and pave the way, which he did
    most successfully, for his master's succession. He was appointed
    Master of the Rolls in 1604, and lies buried in the Rolls Chapel.]


Lord Henry Howard[191] would come and continue at prayers when the
Queene came, but otherwise would not endure them, seeming to performe
the duty of a subject in attending on his prince at the one tyme, and at
the other using his conscience. He would runne out of the Queenes
chamber in hir sicknes when the chaplein went to prayer. Their prayer,
for him, like a conjuracion for a spirit.

Henry Nevill with the counsellors; like either shall be one of their
rankes.


It is a common bruit, yet false, that Sir Walter Rhaly is out of his
Captainship of the Guard; _facile quod velint credunt, quod credunt

Sir Amias Preston, an auncient knight, sent a challendge a while since
to Sir Wa. Ra. which was not aunswered. Sir Ferdinand Gorge is out with
him, as some say.[192]

    Amias Preston's challenge. Speaking of a book against the title of
    King James to succeed Elizabeth, which Cobham had stated that "he
    had" from Raleigh,--"I never gave it him," answered Raleigh, "he
    took it off my table. For I remember a little before that time I
    received a challenge from Sir Amias Preston, and, for that I did
    intend to answer it, I resolved to leave my estate settled,
    therefore laid out all my loose papers, amongst which was this
    book." (State Trials, ii. 21.) As to the relations between Sir

Mr. Hemmings, sometyme of Trinity College in Cambridge, in a sermon at

naught; and yf he should chaunce to find a good one, yet he were not
suer to hold hir soe: for women are like a coule full of snakes amongst
which there is one eele, a thousand to one yf a man happen upon the
eele, and yet if he gett it in his hand, all that he hath gotten is but
a wett eele by the tayle. (_Mr. Osborne._)

friend Emanuell Drom of London, merchant, overseer of the same, unto
whom I give for his pains therein 10_l._

The residue I give to my executor, and I require, charge, and adjure him
by all the love and duty which he oweth me, for all my love and
liberality which I have always borne him and his heretofore, but chiefly
in this my will, that he perform and pay all and every legacy in this my
last will given within six months at the farthest after my death, those
excepted that are appointed to be paid at certain days limited, and
those also to be duly paid at their days appointed and limited, all
according to my true intent and meaning, as my trust is in him, and as
he will answer afore God and me at the latter day.

If it be needful, I confirm to my executor the grant and gift formerly
by me unto him made of all this my mansion house called Bradborne with
my lands situate in East Malling, except as in the same gift is
excepted, in which said grant I have reserved to myself a power to
dispose of the premises, by will or otherwise, to what persons I list
for the space of five years after my decease, as by the said deed dated
3rd January in the 7th year of the King that now is appears. I renounce
the said power, and leave the premises to John Manningham and his heirs
for ever immediately after my death.

I give to the said John Manningham all other my lands in East Malling,
and to his heirs for ever, except one tenement lately purchased of John
Goldsmyth, now in the occupation of Harry Metcalfe, and that other
tenement in Melstreet [Mill street?] called Hackstables, lately
purchased of John Dowle, both which tenements I give to my bailiff
Thomas Rayner and to his heirs for ever; and also excepting to my poor
servant Thomas Whithead his dwelling use and profit of that cottage
called Poor John's during his life.

I give to the said John Manningham all my lands in Cranbrook, to him and
his heirs for ever.

Lastly, I give to my kinsman John Arnold of St. Alban's, and to my
kinsman Richard Lawrence of Maidstone, and to my maid-servant Annis
Hull, and to their heirs for ever, my thirty acres of land called
Larkhall in Hadlow or elsewhere in Kent, lately purchased of Thomas
Tutsom, now in the occupation of John Bredger, to be equally divided
between them, and I give to each of them 20 nobles in money.

Having thus, I thank God, finished this my last will and testament, and
set an order in my worldy affairs, I will now henceforward await God's
merciful will and pleasure, to depart hence in peace when his blessed
will shall be to call for me, most humbly beseeching him of his infinite
goodness and mercy that when the final day of my dissolution shall be
come I may by his grace be armed with a true and lively faith, firm
hope, and constant patience against all the assaults and temptations of
my ghostly enemy the Devil, and to be willing and ready to forsake all
to go to my blessed Saviour and Redeemer Jesus Christ. Amen, good Lord.

Will all written with mine owne hand in five whole pages and eight lines
of the sixth page fastened together with my seal in merchants' wax.

Attestation states the length of the will, and that, in the presence of
the witnesses, the testator fastened all the pages together with his
seal in merchants' and hard wax.

Witnesses: William Prew, rector de Ditton; Richard Brewer; Matthew
Crowhurst; William Whiller.

Proved in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury before Dr. Thomas Edwardes
on the first May 1612, by John Manningham, the executor. Registered in

ADDENDA AND CORRIGENDA.


_Introd. p. x._--Although born in Hampshire, there is reason to believe,
from a similarity of arms, that Thomas Manningham, Bishop of Chichester,
was descended from the Cambridgeshire branch of our Diarist's family. He
was educated at Winchester and New College, Oxford. His principal
preferments in the church were the Preachership at the Rolls, the
Lectureship at the Temple, and the Rectory of St. Andrew's Holborn, to
which last he was presented by the Crown in 1691; he also held a royal
chaplaincy, and the Deanery of Windsor, to which he was appointed in
1708. He kept his Deanery in _commendam_ with his Bishopric.[195] Many
of his sermons were published; one preached at St. Andrew's on the death
of Queen Mary, 4to. London, 1695, passed through at any event three
editions, and has an interest from the preacher's delineation of the
amiable character of his royal mistress.

    [Footnote 195: See Wood's Athenae, iv. 555; and Dallaway's Sussex, i.
    94.]

Sir Richard Manningham published, besides certain more strictly
professional works, "An Exact Diary" (another Manningham's Diary) "of
what was observ'd during a close attendance upon Mary Toft, the
pretended Rabbet-Breeder of Godalming in Surrey, from Monday Nov. 28 to
Wednesday Dec. 7 following. Together with an account of her confession
of the Fraud. By Sir Richard Manningham, Kt. Fellow of the Royal
Society, and of the College of Physicians, London." (Lond. 8vo. 1726.)
Another of Sir Richard's good deeds was the erection of the well-known
Park Chapel, Chelsea.[196] He died on the 11th May 1759, and was buried
at Chelsea.

    [Footnote 196: In Munk's Roll of the Royal College of Physicians,
    ii. 67, an excellent work of reference, to which I am indebted for
    most of these particulars, "Chelsea" is misprinted, in this
    instance, "Cheltenham."]

_P._ 13. _l._ 11.--_For_ Dene, _read_ Drewe.

_P._ 18. _l._ 5.--The anagram upon the name "Davis," here attributed to
"Martin," should have had a note to point out that the combination of
these two names leads one to suppose that the Davis alluded to was
probably the future Sir John Davies, and that the Martin to whom this
saucy witticism is attributed, may have been the Richard Martin
commemorated by Ben Jonson, and the person for a scandalous attack upon
whom Davies was temporarily struck off the books of the Middle Temple,
as mentioned at p. 168. The outrage occurred on the 9th February 1597-8.
Davies was restored to his membership of the Inn on the 30th October
1601. The late Lord Stowell, in his communication to the Society of
Antiquaries on this subject (Archaeologia, xxi. 108,) somewhat favours a
suggestion of Alexander Chalmers that a rivalry between Martin and
Davies in colloquial wit may have led to Davies's misconduct. The
peculiarity in Sir John's gait noticed at p. 168, and which would
attract more attention among young students than it deserved, was
probably not unique. Sir Walter Scott, who no doubt drew from an
original, describes something very like it in the instance of Baillie
Macwheeble, who waddled across the court-yard of the manor-house of
Tully Veolan, like a turnspit walking upon its hind legs.

Autobiography.

_P._ 85, _third line from the bottom_.--These remarks may perhaps be a
young man's judgment upon the works of the celebrated Dr. John Reynolds,
president of Corpus Christi College, Oxford. Bishop Hall spoke of him in
other terms:--"He alone was a well-furnished library, full of all
faculties, of all studies, of all learning; the memory and reading of
that man were near to a miracle." The opinion of all his most
distinguished contemporaries agreed with that of Bishop Hall. (Wood's
Athenae, ii. 11.)

TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE


Throughout the text, paragraph spacing varied, with some paragraphs
having more whitespace above them. I have retained this paragraph
spacing. In cases in which a paragraph started at the top of the
page and was surrounded by other "spaced" paragraphs, I added space
above it if the top-of-the-page paragraph did not relate closely
to the paragraph before it.

"^" was placed before a character to show that it is superscript.

Long blank space within paragraph text has been maintained on:

  - Page 50
  - Page 59

In the Index at the end of the book, there are references to three
items that do not exist in the text. Consequently, I have been
unable to link these items:

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
