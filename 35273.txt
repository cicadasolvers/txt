   Transcriber's Note

   Led by the belief that the spelling and punctuation of each
   entry is based directly on the original title pages no
   intentional 'corrections' have been made to the content. The
   text in this e-book is as close to the original printed text
   as pgdp proofing and postprocessing could get it. In some
   entries larger spaces are used as spacers between
   bibliographic fields instead of punctuation. These have been
   retained to the best of our ability and are represented as
   non-breaking spaces.

the Publick ought to thank us, and with which it was in the Power of

POPE, ALEXANDER.--The Dunciad. an Heroic Poem. In three Books, [woodcut
of vase of flowers] Dublin, Printed, London Reprinted for A. Dodd. [May
28] 1728. _8vo, brown morocco, blind-tooled, gilt top, uncut edges._

An uncut copy of the first issue of the first edition, measuring 8-1/4
by 5 inches. "B" of Thoms's list, similar to the copy in the British
Museum.

The distinguishing marks of this first issue are the misprint, "Book and
the man I sing" instead of "Books," page 1, line 1, and the blank page
on the verso of H2 instead of an advertisement.

Three varieties of the Owl frontispiece are found in the different
editions; the first as in this issue, the second in that edition of 1728
which is entirely reset (page 302), and the third in the variorum
edition, 1729. Perhaps the simplest method of identification is by means
of the legend on the scroll held by the Owl. In variety No. 1, the
second line, "Dunci-" has a hyphen at the end; in No. 2 it has not; in
No. 3 the second line is the complete word "Dunciad." The Owl in No. 1
is better drawn than in No. 2; the "s" in "Shakesp." is a long "s" in
No. 1, which is not the case in No. 2; all the lettering in No. 1 is
smaller than in No. 2. The Owl in No. 3 is more like No. 1 than No. 2
is; "P. & K. Arthur," on the book under the Owl's claws in 1 and 2 is
changed to "Gildon & Woolston" in No. 3; "New-castle" on the back of
the book next the floor in 1 and 2 is changed to "Blackmore" in No. 3.
The lettering in No. 3 corresponds more nearly in size to No. 1 than
does that in No. 2.

The present copy was once owned by Jonathan Richardson, the painter.

Second issue of the first edition. "C" of Thoms's list.

The distinguishing mark of this issue is on page 1, line 1 (ending with
"who"), where "Book and the man I sing" is corrected to "Books." The
text was probably printed from the same forms of type as the first
issue, with corrections of some, but not all, typographical
irregularities; e.g., on page vii of the Preface the second "i" of the
Roman numeral extends above the line in both issues; on page 1, line 1,
of the second issue the last letter in "who" has been raised to the
line, whereas in the first it is below. On page 5 the same space exists
in both issues between "F" and "i" of "First" in the running head-line;
on page 23, line 159, the misprint "spirits" occurs in both issues. In
the note on page 5 "Interlude" of the first issue is changed to
"Enterlude" in the second.

In the first issue the verso of H2 is blank; in the second it contains
an announcement: "Speedily will be Published The Progress of Dulness,
an Historical Poem. By an Eminent Hand. Price 1s. 6d."

Signature A of the first issue is not lettered; the first page of the
Preface in the second is lettered A3.

Page vii of the Preface in the first issue is lettered "b"; in the
second issue it is unlettered, making six leaves in A, the present issue
being a 12mo in sixes, the first an 8vo in fours, with corresponding
alterations in signature marks.

POPE, ALEXANDER.--The Dunciad. an Heroic Poem. In three books. The
Second Edition. Dublin, Printed; London, Reprinted for A. Dodd. 1728.
_12mo, maroon morocco, blind-tooled, gilt top, uncut edges._

"D" of Thoms's list. Presumably the third issue of the first edition,
although the title-page says "second edition." The Address from the
Publisher to the Reader appears to have been printed from the same forms
as the two preceding issues ("B" and "C" of Thoms's list), because of
many similarities of dropped letters and defective types. The text was
probably printed from the same type reimposed to admit of the
interpolation of notes, e.g., on page 5, "Lord Mayor of London" is added
to the note, "Sir Geo. Tho--"; on page 6, line 94, "And furious D--n" is
changed to "D--s"; on page 7 two notes are added, "Old Printers." and
"Sec. Philemon Holland." On page 22 the addition of a note of three lines
necessitated the transference of two lines of text to the top of page
23; "Spirts," line 159, page 23, is here correctly printed, whereas in
the previous issue it is "Spirits." The advertisement of "The Progress
of Dulness" on the verso of F2 does not occur here.

POPE, ALEXANDER.--The Dunciad. an Heroic Poem. In three books. [Square
printer's ornament] Dublin, Printed, London Reprinted for A. Dodd. 1728.
_12mo, maroon morocco, blind-tooled, gilt top, uncut edges._

Undescribed by Thoms.

Another edition of 1728, presumably the second, rather than the
preceding. The type is entirely reset in the body of the work, although
the same founts are used. On the title-page it is larger and of a
heavier face than in the preceding edition, and the ornament is
different. The "U" in "Dunciad" is not symmetrical, as in the other
edition, but has a straight right and a curved left side. The Owl
frontispiece has been re-engraved (variety No. 2).

The first page of the Preface, A2 (A3 in the other edition), has a
large, heavy capital "I" for "It," whereas the other begins with an "I"
in a woodcut border.

"Who," the last word of the first line of the other edition, is the
first word of the second line here,--the distinguishing mark of this
edition. The type of the final page of advertisement is of much lighter
face than in the other edition.

It does not contain the additional notes on pages 5, 7, and 22, and the
spelling of "Interludes" in the note on page 5 is preserved; therefore
it was probably set up from a copy of "B" rather than "C," although the
misprint "spirits," page 23, line 159, is corrected.

POPE, ALEXANDER.--The Dunciad, variorvm. With the Prolegomena of
Scriblerus [vignette of Ass]   London. Printed for A. Dod. 1729. _4to,
red levant morocco, gilt back and sides, gilt top, uncut edges, by
Riviere._

First complete, and author's first avowed edition. "F" of Thoms's list.

Four varieties of the Ass frontispiece are found in different editions.
No. 1 as in the present edition, No. 2 in the first variorum 8vo
edition, No. 3 in the reprint of the variorum 4to (page x), and No. 4 in
the Collected Works, folio, 1735.

Although the difference between Nos. 1 and 2 is perfectly evident when
the two plates are compared side by side, the details of No. 1 are so
faithfully re-engraved in No. 2 that a definite mark of differentiation
is difficult to give. In No. 1 the spacing of the letters in "vicum" in
the inscription at the left of the vignette is uneven; there is too much
space between "v" and its adjacent letters. This is not so in No. 2. In
No. 2, on the other hand, the "o" in "deferor" is raised above the line,
as it is not in No. 1. Perhaps the surest means is measurement; No. 1 is
4 inches in height; No. 2, 3-7/8 inches.

No. 3 is much smaller and has very evidently been re-engraved. The
spelling "Heywood" is found here instead of "Haywood," as in Nos. 1 and
2. In No. 4 the caption of the paper in the right foreground is "The
Free Briton" instead of "Bakers journal," as in Nos. 1, 2, and 3.

It is difficult to determine the priority of the various editions of the
four Epistles composing this Essay. Whereas there were once supposed to
be only four editions, it is now generally conceded that there are ten
or eleven, two of the First Epistle with "Part I." on the title-page,
two of the First with "Epistle I." on the title-page, three of the
Second, two of the Third, and one of the Fourth.

No recorded investigations are sufficiently advanced to be of service,
and in the matter of the numbering of the lines or neglect to number,
one theory is as plausible as another. It is granted, however, that the
editions of the First Epistle with "Part I." on the title-page were
earlier printed than those bearing "Epistle I."

The wording of the third title-page is the same as the second, with the
substitution of "Epistle III." for "Epistle II.," but they are
differently set up. In the imprint of Epistle II, "J. Wilford" is in
lower case italics, in Epistle III in small capitals; "Chapter-House" in
Epistle III is in lower case italics, and not in Epistle II.

In the Address to the Reader preceding Epistle II, Pope says, "The
Author has been induced to publish these Epistles separately for two
Reasons; The one, that he might not impose upon the Publick too much
at once of what he thinks incorrect; The other, that by this Method, he
might profit of its Judgement on the Parts, in order to make the Whole
less unworthy of it."

First edition of Epistle IV. Epistle I, although it contains only five
lines more than in the first edition, i.e., 286, is considerably
altered: e.g., between lines 22 and 23, six lines are inserted in the
present edition; lines 29-34 are here omitted, and 35-42 of the first
are transposed after 60; 95-100 and 111-114 in the first edition are
omitted in the second; 115-116 in the second are new; 149 in the first
is omitted in the second, and 142 in the second is new. These are a few
of the alterations.

In Epistle II the lines are not numbered, except line 175, although the
number is the same as in the first edition.

Epistle III is printed from the same forms of type as the first edition.

First editions. The Epistle to Lord Cobham, Of the Knowledge and
Character of Men, Of the Characters of Women, and Of the Use of Riches
are the first three of the four Moral Essays written in the form of
Epistles.

In this edition of the Characters of Women, Philomede (Henrietta,
Duchess of Marlborough in her own right), Atossa (her mother the Duchess
Sarah), and Chloe (Lady Suffolk) do not appear. The Epistle to Dr.
Arbuthnot is the Prologue to the Satires.

The First Satire of the Second Book of Horace is presumably the first of
four issues of the first of two editions printed in 1733, with no
defective type on the title-page, and the catch-word on page 13
misprinted "In" for "Whether." It has been asserted that there were five
editions of this poem in 1733, but an examination of various copies
shows that defective type in the text occurs in the same places in four
out of five instances. This would indicate that the type was actually
reset only once, although variations of signature marks and marginal
signs show that slight typographical changes were made as the sheets
passed through the press. These, however, are not important enough to
constitute new editions. The real test is in the composition of the text
itself. The sheets of the four issues are the same, but on one
title-page the words "Price One Shilling" are added after the date.

It has been asserted that there are three editions of the Second Epistle
of the Second Book of Horace; but, on the same grounds as in the
previous poem, it seems more probable that there were three issues of
one edition, parts of which were possibly reset, as indicated by
occasional corrections of defective type. The present issue is
presumably the first, with the misprint "16" for "15" at the foot of
page 12, an error corrected in the other two issues.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
