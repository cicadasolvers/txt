PREFACE


The career of Daniel Alexander Payne Murray, who served as a member of
the staff in various capacities "up to an assistant librarian" from 1871
to 1922, is a natural starting point for a discussion of Negro materials
in the Library of Congress. While serving in his first position in the
Library, as a personal assistant to the Librarian, Ainsworth R.
Spofford, Mr. Murray undertook the systematic study of "the origin and
historical growth of the colored race throughout the civilized world,"
which he hoped would result in an encyclopedic history of his race.
Almost 30 years later, he was chosen by Herbert Putnam, then just
beginning his career as Librarian, to respond to a request from
Ferdinand W. Peck, Commissioner General of the United States to the
Paris exposition of 1900, that a collection of books and pamphlets by
Afro-American authors be made a feature of the American exhibit at the
exposition. Within a period of 2 weeks, Mr. Murray prepared a
preliminary list of 223 works written by 152 Negro authors. The purpose
of this list was to aid in securing a copy of "every book and pamphlet
in existence, by a Negro Author, the same to be used in connection with
the exhibit of Negro Authorship in the Paris Exposition of 1900, and
later placed in the Library of Congress."

It was soon discovered that, owing to Dr. Spofford's foresight, the
Library of Congress was "uncommonly rich in such books and pamphlets,"
but "no little difficulty was encountered then and subsequently in
identifying them." By the time the world exposition at Paris opened in
May 1900, however, Mr. Murray had located 1,100 titles written by Negro
authors, of which about 500 were forwarded to the exposition. Thomas J.
Calloway, special agent for the U.S. Commission at the exposition, wrote
that "the most creditable showing in the exhibit is by Negro authors
collected by Mr. Daniel Murray of the library of Congress."

After the close of the Paris exposition, Mr. Murray continued to collect
works by Afro-American, Afro-European, and West Indian authors and to
amass a varied collection of Afro-Americana. At his death in 1925, the
library of Congress received by provision of his will a unique
collection of some "1,448 volumes and pamphlets, 14 broadsides, and 1
map, with the idea that it should form part of the material especially
selected by him for exhibit purposes." The books that had been sent to
the Paris exposition were kept together upon their return to the
Library. This small collection, along with Mr. Murray's bequest and a
few volumes presented to the library by Mrs. Anna Murray after her
husband's death, became the "Colored Author Collection." Many of the
titles have since been cataloged and added to the general collections.

_The Preliminary List of Books and Pamphlets by Negro Authors, for Paris
Exposition and Library of Congress_ (1900), compiled by Daniel Murray,
appears to have been the first effort on the part of the Library to draw
attention to works by and about Negroes.

In 1906 Appleton Prentiss Clark Griffin, chief of the Division of
Bibliography, directed the compilation of a _Select List of References
on the Negro Question_, published by the library. It contained entries
for 232 books and 286 periodical articles published during the period
1879-1906. The library also published in the same year a _List of
Discussions of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments_, which comprised
103 entries. Both bibliographies included titles relating primarily to
Negro suffrage and the Negro in the South and were compiled to "meet
requests by letter upon topics of current interest."

In 1940, for the 75th anniversary of the proclamation of the 13th
amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which abolished
slavery, the Library prepared and issued a bibliography of its special
materials on the Negro. In connection with this anniversary, the Library
also mounted an exhibition of books, manuscripts, and works of art and
arranged a series of concerts. The festival of music and the exhibits
that opened on December 18, 1940, vividly presented the contribution of
the American Negro to American culture.

Without question both scholars and the general public are aware that the
Library of Congress has extensive holdings on the Negro, not only
printed books and periodicals but also manuscripts, music, prints,
photographs, motion pictures, and sound recordings. This awareness is
reflected in the steady flow of requests for bibliographies and other
guides to Negro studies that the Library receives. The factors that
stimulate such requests are rooted in the national--indeed, the
worldwide--interest in the American Negro which recent social and
cultural events in this country have intensified. For many years the
Library has responded to this interest by issuing from time to time
typed lists relating to various aspects of Negro life.

The mounting interest in Negro history and culture, manifested
particularly by the introduction of courses in these subjects in high
school, college, and university curricula, has given rise to a demand
for lists of books that can be used to support such studies. The present
bibliography is designed to meet the current needs of students,
teachers, librarians, researchers, and the general public for
introductory guidance to the study of the Negro in the United States.

This bibliography is selective rather than exhaustive. Among the topics
covered are the urban Negro, relations between the races, discriminatory
practices in all areas, and efforts to obtain political and economic
freedom, as well as the education and cultural history of the Negro, his
religious life, the social conditions under which he lives, and his
historical past. Included are works depicting the lives of outstanding
Negroes--abolitionists, fugitive slaves, educators, civil rights
leaders, scientists, journalists, religious leaders, artists, athletes,
and literary figures.

The selection of many of the titles, especially in the fields of
literature and history, was based on the frequency of requests for
particular works in large library collections on the Negro and on their
inclusion in the numerous bibliographies and reading lists now being
compiled for use in junior colleges, colleges, and universities. In
addition, bibliographic lists and essays appended to such works as _From
Slavery to Freedom_, by John Hope Franklin; _North of Slavery_, by Leon
F. Litwack; _The Burden of Race: a Documentary History of Negro-White
Relations in America_, by Gilbert Osofsky; _The Negro in the Civil War_,
by Benjamin Quarles; _The Black Power Revolt_, edited by Floyd B.
Barbour; and _The Negro in the United States_, by E. Franklin Frazier,
were consulted. Use was also made of previously published bibliographies
such as Monroe Work's _Bibliography of the Negro in Africa and America_
and Erwin A. Salk's _A Layman's Guide to Negro History_.

While some books written especially for children and young people are
included, and some of the other publications cited are well adapted to
their use, no systematic effort was made to represent material of this
type. Lists such as Miles M. Jackson's _Bibliography of Negro History &
Culture for Young Readers_ may be used as guides in this field.

Identification of writers by race has not been attempted except in the
section on fiction, which lists only novels and short stories written by
representative Negro authors. While the writings of white novelists are
not cited, the importance of the treatment of Negro characters and the
educational, moral, and artistic value of works by such authors as
Howard Fast, William Faulkner, Harper Lee, Du Bose Heyward, Julia
Peterkin, Lillian Smith, Harriet Beecher Stowe, T. S. Stribling, and
Mark Twain are undisputed. Apart from fiction, the publications of both
white and Negro writers are included throughout the bibliography.

The compiler gratefully acknowledges the invaluable editorial assistance
of Mary Jane Gibson, assistant head of the Bibliography and Reference
Correspondence Section, General Reference and Bibliography Division,
Library of Congress. Miss Gibson also prepared the index. The compiler
wishes to express her appreciation as well to Ruth S. Freitag, head of
the Bibliography and Reference Correspondence Section, for helpful
suggestions and for assistance in indexing and proofreading, and to
Robert H. Land, chief of the General Reference and Bibliography
Division, for emphasizing the need for the bibliography and offering
encouragement while the work was in progress.

NOTE TO THE USER


_Scope._ The emphasis of this bibliography is on recent monographs in
the collections of the library of Congress, although a number of
important older works, a few periodicals, and several titles from the
holdings of other American libraries are included.

_Arrangement._ Entries are arranged alphabetically by author under broad
subject headings that reveal the Negro's part in numerous aspects of
American life, culture, and history. An index of names and subjects is
provided.

_Annotations._ Entries have been given brief annotations where
clarification seemed necessary. Because of the increasing importance for
the building of library collections of scholarly reprints of long
unavailable classics in Negro literature and history, indication of
reprint editions has been made where possible.

_Call numbers and location symbols._ Location of items is indicated
either by a Library of Congress call number or location symbol, or, for
material in another library, by the National Union Catalog symbol for
that library. A key to the symbols used is given on the next page.

A Word from Project Gutenberg


We will update this book if we find any errors.

This book can be found under: http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36021

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no one
owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and
you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission
and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth in the
General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to copying and
distributing Project Gutenberg(tm) electronic works to protect the
Project Gutenberg(tm) concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a
registered trademark, and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks,
unless you receive specific permission. If you do not charge anything
for copies of this eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may
use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative
works, reports, performances and research. They may be modified and
printed and given away - you may do practically _anything_ with public
domain eBooks.  Redistribution is subject to the trademark license,
especially commercial redistribution.



The Full Project Gutenberg License


_Please read this before you distribute or use this work._

To protect the Project Gutenberg(tm) mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work (or
any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg(tm) License available with this file or online at
http://www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1. General Terms of Use & Redistributing Project Gutenberg(tm)
electronic works


*1.A.* By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg(tm)
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all the
terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy all
copies of Project Gutenberg(tm) electronic works in your possession. If
you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg(tm) electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

*1.B.* "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few things
that you can do with most Project Gutenberg(tm) electronic works even
without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See paragraph
1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg(tm) electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg(tm) electronic
works. See paragraph 1.E below.

*1.C.* The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of
Project Gutenberg(tm) electronic works. Nearly all the individual works
in the collection are in the public domain in the United States. If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you
from copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating
derivative works based on the work as long as all references to Project
Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope that you will support the
Project Gutenberg(tm) mission of promoting free access to electronic
works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg(tm) works in compliance with
the terms of this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg(tm) name
associated with the work. You can easily comply with the terms of this
agreement by keeping this work in the same format with its attached full
Project Gutenberg(tm) License when you share it without charge with
others.

*1.D.* The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg(tm) work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

*1.E.* Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

*1.E.1.* The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg(tm) License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg(tm) work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
    almost no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away
    or re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License
    included with this eBook or online at http://www.gutenberg.org

*1.E.2.* If an individual Project Gutenberg(tm) electronic work is
derived from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating
that it is posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can
be copied and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying
any fees or charges. If you are redistributing or providing access to a
work with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on
the work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs
1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg(tm) trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

*1.E.3.* If an individual Project Gutenberg(tm) electronic work is
posted with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and
distribution must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and
any additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg(tm) License for all works posted
with the permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of
this work.

*1.E.4.* Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project
Gutenberg(tm) License terms from this work, or any files containing a
part of this work or any other work associated with Project
Gutenberg(tm).

*1.E.5.* Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg(tm) License.

*1.E.6.* You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg(tm) work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg(tm) web site
(http://www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or
expense to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a
means of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include
the full Project Gutenberg(tm) License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

*1.E.7.* Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg(tm) works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

*1.E.8.* You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg(tm) electronic works
provided that

  - You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
    the use of Project Gutenberg(tm) works calculated using the method
    you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
    to the owner of the Project Gutenberg(tm) trademark, but he has
    agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
    Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
    within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
    legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
    payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
    Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
    Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
    Literary Archive Foundation."

  - You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
    you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
    does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg(tm)
    License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
    copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
    all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg(tm)
    works.

  - You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
    any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
    electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
    receipt of the work.

  - You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
    distribution of Project Gutenberg(tm) works.


*1.E.9.* If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg(tm) electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg(tm) trademark. Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3. below.

*1.F.*

*1.F.1.* Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg(tm) collection.
Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg(tm) electronic works, and the
medium on which they may be stored, may contain "Defects," such as, but
not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data, transcription
errors, a copyright or other intellectual property infringement, a
defective or damaged disk or other medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

*1.F.2.* LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg(tm) trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg(tm) electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal fees.
YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY,
BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE PROVIDED IN
PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE TRADEMARK OWNER, AND
ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES
EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

*1.F.3.* LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund. If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

*1.F.4.* Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

*1.F.5.* Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law. The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

*1.F.6.* INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg(tm) electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg(tm) electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg(tm)
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg(tm) work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg(tm)


Project Gutenberg(tm) is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg(tm)'s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg(tm) collection will remain
freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and
permanent future for Project Gutenberg(tm) and future generations. To
learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and
how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the
Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org .


Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state
of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue
Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification number is
64-6221541. Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf . Contributions to the
Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation


Project Gutenberg(tm) depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where
we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any
statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside
the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways
including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate,
please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg(tm) electronic
works.


Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg(tm)
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg(tm) eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg(tm) eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless
a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks
in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's eBook
number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected _editions_ of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed.
_Versions_ based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

    http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg(tm),
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
