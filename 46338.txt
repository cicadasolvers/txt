  'Twill be wintry weather till the calends of May.

       *       *       *       *       *

The wind of the South will be productive of heat and fertility; the
wind of the West, of milk and fish; the wind from the North, of cold
and storm; the wind from the East, of fruit on the trees.

  _Scotland._

       *       *       *       *       *

        At New Year's tide
  The days lengthen a cock's stride.

         *       *       *       *       *

A cold January, a feverish February, a dusty March, a weeping April, a
windy May, presage a good year and gay.

                                        _France._

       *       *       *       *       *

Warwickshire countrymen to ensure good luck bow nine times to the first
New Moon of the year.

       *       *       *       *       *

  A snow year, a rich year.

       *       *       *       *       *

  The blackest month of all the year
  Is the month of Janiveer.

       *       *       *       *       *

  Through all the sad and weary hours
    Which cold and dark and storms will bring,
  We scarce believe in what we know--
    That time drags on at last to Spring.

       *       *       *       *       *

  The empty pastures blind with rain.

       *       *       *       *       *

  If the grass grow in Janiveer
  'Twill be the worse for 't all the year.

       *       *       *       *       *

  A fair day in winter is the mother of a storm.

       *       *       *       *       *

Under water famine, under snow bread.

       *       *       *       *       *

      March in Janiveer,
  Janiveer in March I fear.

       *       *       *       *       *

A year of snow a year of plenty.

                                        _Spain._

       *       *       *       *       *

  Winter time for shoeing;
  Peascod time for wooing.

                                        _Devon._

On Twelve-eve in Christmas, they used to set up as high as they can
a sieve of oats, and in it a dozen candles set round, and in the
centre one larger, all lighted. This in memory of our Saviour and His
Apostles, lights of the world.

                                        _Westmeath custom._

       *       *       *       *       *

In the South-hams of Devonshire, on the Eve of the Epiphany, the farmer
attended by his workmen, with a large pitcher of cyder, goes to the
orchard, and there, encircling one of the best bearing trees, they
drink the following toast three several times:

        "Here's to thee, old apple-tree,
  Whence thou mayst bud, and whence thou mayst blow!
  And whence thou mayst bear apples enow!
        Hats-full, caps-full!
        Bushel-bushel-sacks-full!
  And my pockets full too! Huzza!"

       *       *       *       *       *

OLD CUSTOM OF BLESSING APPLE TREES ON TWELFTH DAY.

  Apple-tree, apple-tree,
  Bear apples for me:
  Hats full, laps full,
  Sacks full, caps full:
  Apple-tree, apple-tree,
  Bear apples for me.

       *       *       *       *       *

"Twelfth-Day--came in a tiffany suit, white and gold, like a queen on a
frost-cake, all royal, glittering, and Epiphanous."

                                        _Elia._

       *       *       *       *       *

January the fourteenth will be either the coldest or wettest day of the
year.

                                        _Huntingdon._

       *       *       *       *       *

ST. ANTHONY. (_January 17th._)

It is affirmed of him that all the world bemoaned his death, for
afterwards there fell no rain from heaven for three years.

ST. VINCENT. (_January 22nd. Old Style. February 3rd. New Style._)

  Remember in St. Vincent's Day
  If the sun his beams display,
  'Tis a token bright and clear,
  That you will have a prosperous year.

       *       *       *       *       *

Winter's thunder's summer's wonder.

       *       *       *       *       *

ST. PAUL'S EVE. (_January 24th._)

  Winter's white shrowd doth cover all the grounde,
  And Caecias blows his bitter blaste of woe;
  The ponds and pooles, and streams in ice are bounde,
  And famished birds are shivering in the snowe.

         *       *       *       *       *

  Still round about the house they flitting goe,
  And at the windows seek for scraps of foode
  Which Charity with hand profuse doth throwe,
  Right weeting that in neede of it they stoode,
  For Charity is shown by working creatures goode.
  The sparrowe pert, the chaffinche gay and cleane,
  The redbreast welcome to the cotter's house,
  The livelie blue tomtit, the oxeye greene,
  The dingie dunnock, and the swart colemouse;
  The titmouse of the marsh, the nimble wrenne,
  The bullfinch and the goldspink, with the king
  Of birds the goldcrest. The thrush, now and then,
  The blackbird, wont to whistle in the spring,
  Like Christians seeke the heavenlie food Saint
  Paul doth bring.

                                        _Dr. Forster._

       *       *       *       *       *

ST. PAUL'S DAY.

  If Saint Paul's Day be fair and clear,
  It promises then a happy year;
  But if it chance to snow or rain,
  Then will be dear all sorts of grain;
  Or if the wind do blow aloft,
  Great stirs will vex the world full oft;
  And if dark clouds do muff the sky,
  Then foul and cattle oft will die.

                                        _T. Passenger._

       *       *       *       *       *

OF GARDENS.

For the latter part of January and February, the mezerion tree, which
then blossoms; crocus vernus, both the yellow and the gray; primroses,
anemones, the early tulippa, hyacinthus orientalis, chamairis,
frettellaria.

                                        _Bacon._

       *       *       *       *       *

  A January spring
  Is worth no thing.

       *       *       *       *       *

  Pluck broom, broom still,
  Cut broom, broom kill.

                                         _Tusser._

       *       *       *       *       *

  Good gardener mine,
  Make garden fine,
  Set garden pease,
  And beans if ye please.
  Set respis and rose,
  Young roots of those.
  Who now sows oats
  Gets gold and groats.
  Who sows in May,
  Gets little that way.

                                        _Tusser._

       *       *       *       *       *

  A kindly good January freezeth pot by the fire.

       *       *       *       *       *

  O Winter! wilt thou never--never go!
  O Summer! but I weary for thy coming!

                                        _David Gray._

       *       *       *       *       *

If the robin sings in the bush, then the weather will be coarse; but if
the robin sings on the barn, then the weather will be warm.

                                        _Norfolk._




FEBRUARY


  Ancient Cornish name:
  Hu-evral, whirling month.

       *       *       *       *       *

  Jewel: Amethyst. Sincerity.

       *       *       *       *       *

  One month is past, another is begun,
  Since merry bells rang out the dying year,
  And buds of rarest green began to peer,
  As if impatient for a warmer sun;
  And though the distant hills are bleak and dun,
  The virgin snowdrop, like a lambent fire,
  Pierces the cold earth, with its green-streaked spire;
  And in dark woods the wandering little one
  May find a primrose.

                                        _Hartley Coleridge._

       *       *       *       *       *

  Fair rising from her icy couch,
  Wan herald of the floral year,
  The snowdrop marks the spring's approach,
  Ere yet the primrose groups appear,
  Or peers the arum from its spotted veil,
  Or violets scent the cold capricious gale.

                                        _Charlotte Smith._

       *       *       *       *       *

  Candlemas shined, and the winter's behind.

       *       *       *       *       *

  If Candlemas Day be fair and bright
  The winter will take another flight;
  But if it should be dark and drear
  Then winter is gone for another year.

       *       *       *       *       *

  When on the Purification sun hath shined,
  The greater part of winter comes behind.

       *       *       *       *       *

The badger peeps out of his hole on Candlemas Day, and if he finds
snows, walks abroad; but if he sees the sun shining, he draws back into
his hole.

                                        _German saying._

       *       *       *       *       *

  On Candlemas Day if the thorns hang-a-drop,
  Then you are sure of a good pea crop.

       *       *       *       *       *

  When the wind's in the East on Candlemas Day,
  There it will stick till the second of May.

       *       *       *       *       *

  February fill the ditch,
  Black or white we don't care which.

                                        _Hants._

       *       *       *       *       *

  All the months of the year
  Fear a fair Februeer.

       *       *       *       *       *

  The dim droop of a sombre February day.

       *       *       *       *       *

  There is an old proverb,
  That birds of a feather
  On Saint Valentine's day
  Will meet together.

       *       *       *       *       *

1733.

  Why, Valentine's a day to choose
  A mistress, and our freedom lose?
  May I my reason interpose,
  The question with an answer close?
  To imitate we have a mind,
  And couple like the winged kind.

                                        _John Dunton._

       *       *       *       *       *

  I early rose, just at the break of day,
  Before the sun had chased the stars away;
  Afield I went, amid the morning dew,
  To milk my kine (for so should housewives do),
  Thee first I spied, and the first swain we see.
  In spite of fortune, shall our true-love be.

                                        _Gay._

       *       *       *       *       *

SHROVE-TIDE.

  Beef and bacon's out of season,
  I want a pan to parch my peason.

                                        _Berks._

       *       *       *       *       *

  Knick-knock, the pan's hot,
  And we are come a-shroving,
  For a piece of pancake,
  Or a piece of bacon,
  Or a piece of truckle cheese
  Of your own making.

                                        _Hants._

       *       *       *       *       *

  On Shrove Tuesday night, though the supper be fat,
  Before Easter Day thou mayst fast for that.

                                        _Isle of Man._

       *       *       *       *       *

PANCAKE BELL. (_Congleton._)

  The housekeeper goes to the huxter's shop,
  And the eggs are brought home, and there's flop! flop! flop!
  And there's batter, and butter, and savoury smell,
  While merrily rings the Pancake Bell.

       *       *       *       *       *

So much sun as shineth on Pancake Tuesday, the like will shine every
day in Lent.

       *       *       *       *       *

  A hoar frost,
  Third day crost,
  The fourth lost.

                                        _Lancs._

       *       *       *       *       *

BEAN SOWING.

  One for the mouse, one for the crow,
  One to rot, one to grow.

       *       *       *       *       *

  Sow peason and beans in the wane of the moone,
  Who soweth them sooner, he soweth too soon;
  That they with the planet may rest and rise,
  And flourish with bearing, most plentiful wise.

                                        _Tusser._

       *       *       *       *       *

  If February gives much snow
  A fine summer it doth foreshow.

       *       *       *       *       *

  Now set for thy pot
  Best herbs to be got,
  For flowers go set,
  All sorts ye can get.

                                        _Tusser._

       *       *       *       *       *

In Oxfordshire the first bee seen in February is saluted, as this is
said to bring good luck.

       *       *       *       *       *

THRUSH'S SONG.

  "Did he do it? Did he do it?
  Come and see, come and see;
  Knee deep, knee deep;
  Cherry sweet, cherry sweet,
  To me! to me! to me!"

       *       *       *       *       *

  The pretty lark,
  Climbing the welkin clear,
  Chaunts with a "Cheer, here, peer,
  I near my dear!"
  When stooping thence,
  Seeming her fall to rue,
  "Adieu," she cries,
  "Adieu! dear Love, adieu!"

       *       *       *       *       *

When after a rough and stormy day there is a lull in the wind at the

When a moorland shepherd meets his sheep on a winter's night coming
down from the hilltops (where they prefer to sleep) he knows that a
storm is brewing.




MARCH


  Ancient Cornish name:
  Miz-merp, horse month.

       *       *       *       *       *

  Jewel: Bloodstone. Courage and wisdom.

       *       *       *       *       *

  Upon St. David's Day
  Put oats and barley in the clay.

       *       *       *       *       *

  The leeke is white and green, whereby is ment
  That Britaines are both stout and eminent;
  Next to the lion and the unicorne,
  The leek's the fairest emblyn that is worne.

                                        _Harleian MS._

       *       *       *       *       *

  On the first of March
  The crows begin to search,
  By the first of April
  They are sitting still,
  By the first of May
  They are a' flown away;
  Croupin' greedy back again,
  Wi' October's wind and rain.

       *       *       *       *       *

He who freely lops in March will get his lap full of fruit.

                                        _Portuguese saying._

       *       *       *       *       *

  Tossing his mane of snows in wildest eddies and tangles,
    Warlike March cometh in, hoarse, with tempestuous breath.
  Through all the moaning chimneys, and 'thwart all the hollows and angles,
    Round the shuddering house, breathing of winter and death.

                                        _W. D. Howells._

       *       *       *       *       *

  Welcome, O March! whose kindly days and dry
  Make April ready for the throstle's song,
  Thou first redresser of the winter's wrong.

                                        _W. Morris._

       *       *       *       *       *

OF GARDENS.

For March there come violets, especially the single blue, which are the
earliest; the early daffodil, the daisy, the almond tree in blossom,
the peach tree in blossom, the cornelian (dogwood) tree in blossom,
sweetbrier.

                                        _Bacon._

       *       *       *       *       *

  A frosty winter, and a dusty March,
  And a rain about Aperill,
  And another about the Lammas time
  When the corn begins to fill,
  Is worth a ploughy of gold
  And all her pins theretill.

       *       *       *       *       *

  Come gather the crocus-cups with me,
  And dream of the summer coming;
  Saffron, and purple, and snowy white,
  All awake to the first bees humming.

  The white is there for the maiden-heart,
  And the purple is there for sorrow;
  The saffron is there for the true true love,
  And they'll all be dead to-morrow.

                                        _Sebastian Evans._

       *       *       *       *       *

  Beside the garden path the crocus now
  Puts forth its head to woo the genial breeze,
  And finds the snowdrop, hardier visitant,
  Already basking in the solar ray.
  Upon the brooke the water cresses float
  More greenly, and the bordering reeds exalt
  Higher their speary summits. Joyously,
  From stone to stone, the ouzel flits along,
  Startling the linnet from the hawthorn bough;
  While on the elm-tree, overshadowing deep
  The low-roofed cottage white, the blackbird sits
  Cheerily hymning the awakened year.

       *       *       *       *       *

  Blank earth-baldness clothes itself afresh,
  And breaks into the crocus-purple hour.

                                        _Tennyson._

       *       *       *       *       *

  Spring's an expansive time: yet I don't trust
  March with its peck of dust,
  Nor April with its rainbow-crowned brief showers,
  Nor even May, whose flowers
  One frost may wither through the sunless hours.

                                        _C. Rossetti._

       *       *       *       *       *

If it does not freeze on the tenth of March a fertile year may be
expected.

         *       *       *       *       *

  In March is good graffing, the skilful do know,
  So long as the wind in the east do not blow:
  From moon being changed, till past be the prime,
  For graffing and cropping is very good time.

                                        _Tusser._

       *       *       *       *       *

  In March and in April, from morning to night,
  In sowing and setting good huswives delight:
  To have in a garden or other like plot,
  To trim up their house, and to furnish their pot.

                                        _Tusser._

TO THE DAFFODIL.

  O Love-star of the unbeloved March,
    When cold and shrill,
  Forth flows beneath a low dim-lighted arch
    The wind that beats sharp crag and barren hill,
    And keeps unfilmed the lately torpid rill!

  Herald and harbinger! with thee
  Begins the year's great jubilee!
  Of her solemnities sublime
  (A sacristan whose gusty taper
  Flashes through earliest morning vapour)
  Thou ring'st dark nocturns and dim prime.
  Birds that have yet no heart for song
  Gain strength with thee to twitter,
  And, warm at last, where hollies throng,
  The mirror'd sunbeams glitter.

                                        _A. De Vere._

       *       *       *       *       *

  The softest turf of English green,
  With sloping walks and trees between,
  And then a bed of flowers half-seen.

  Here daffodils in early Spring
  And violets their off'rings bring,
  And sweetest birds their hymns outsing.

       *       *       *       *       *

  When country roads begin to thaw
    In mottled spots of damp and dust,
  And fences by the margin draw
    Along the frozen crust
  Their graphic silhouettes, I say,
  The Spring is coming round this way.

  When suddenly some shadow bird
    Goes wavering beneath the gaze,
  And through the hedge the moan is heard
    Of kine that fain would graze
  In grasses new, I smile and say,
  The Spring is coming round this way.

                                        _Whitcomb Riley._

  Oh, what a dawn of day!
  How the March sun feels like May!
  All is blue again
  After last night's rain.

  No summer flowers are half so sweet
  As those of early Spring.

       *       *       *       *       *

  Under the furze is hunger and cold,
  Under the broom is silver and gold.

       *       *       *       *       *

THE SPRING.

  When wintry weather's all a-done,
  An' brooks do sparkle in the zun,
  An' naisy-builden rooks do vlee
  Wi' sticks toward their elem tree;
  When birds do zing, an' we can zee
  Upon the bough the buds o' spring--
  Then I'm as happy as a king,
  A'vield wi' health an' sunshine.

  Vor then the cowslips hangin' flow'r
  A-wetted in the zunny show'r,
  Do grow wi' vi'lets, sweet o' smell,
  Beside the wood-screen'd graegle's bell;
  Where drushes aggs, wi' sky-blue shell,
  Do lie in mossy nest among
  Thorns, while they do zing their zong
  At evenin' in the zunsheen.

DIVINATION BY A DAFFODIL.

  When a daffodil I see
  Hanging down his head t'wards me,
  Guesse I may what I must be:
  First, I shall decline my head;

APRIL


  Ancient Cornish name:
  Miz-ebrall primrose month.

       *       *       *       *       *

Jewel for the month: Sapphire. Frees from enchantment.

       *       *       *       *       *

  If it thunders on All Fool's day
  It brings good crops of grain and hay.

  The first thunder of the year awakes

       *       *       *       *       *

MS. 250 YEARS OLD.

The first Monday in April Cain was born, and Abel was slain.
The second Monday in August Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed.
The thirty-first of December Judas was born, who betrayed Christ.
These are dangerous days to begin any business, fall sick, or undertake
any journey.

  Auricula with powdered cup, primrose

  Shall to the planet overpay
  The ravage of a year of war.

    In wild moor or sterile heath,
  Bright with the golden furze, beneath
  O'erhanging bush or shelving stone,
  The little stonechat dwells alone,

  His pretty love-songs tinkling sound,
  And rest low seated on the ground;

  That leads him through the secret grass.

HOW VIOLETS CAME BLEW.

  Love on a day (wise poets tell)
  Some time in wrangling spent,
  Whether the Violets sho'd excell,
  Or she, in sweetest scent.
  But Venus having lost the day,
  Poore Girles, she fell on you,
  And beat ye so (as some dare say),
  Her blowes did make ye blew.

of the day when they heard the first note of the cuckoo.

       *       *       *       *       *

There is an old superstition that where one hears the cuckoo first
there one will spend most of the year.

       *       *       *       *       *

  Use maketh maistry, this hath been said alway;
  But all is not alway as all men do say.
  In April, the koocoo can sing her song by rote,
  In June of tune she cannot sing a note:

ODE TO THE CUCKOO.

  Hail, beauteous stranger of the grove!
  Thou messenger of Spring!
  Now Heaven repairs thy rural seat
  And woods thy welcome sing.

  What time the daisy decks the green,
  Thy certain voice we hear;
  Hast thou a star to guide thy path,
  Or mark the rolling year?

  "Cuckoo! cuckoo!" The first we've heard!
  "Cuckoo! cuckoo!" God bless the bird
  Scarce time to take his breath,
  And now "Cuckoo!" he saith.
  Cuckoo! cuckoo! three cheers!
  And let the welkin ring!
  He has not folded wing
  Since last he saw Algiers.

APRIL.

          Winter is so quite forced hence
  And locked up underground, that ev'ry sense
  Hath several objects: trees have got their heads,
  The fields their coats; that now the shining meads
  Do boast the paunse, lily, and the rose;
  And every flower doth laugh as zephyr blows,
  The seas are now more even than the land;
  The rivers run as smoothed by his hand;
  Only their heads are crisped by his stroke.

  Blossom of the almond trees,

  Trust the cruel outer air;
  When the royal kingcup bold
  Dares not don his throat of gold;
  And the sturdy blackthorn spray
  Keeps his silver for the May;
  Coming when no flowerets would
  Save thy lowly sisterhood;
  Early violets, blue and white,
  Dying for their love of light.

  Wild rivers and wild birds sing songs together,

  Save when the wee wren flits with stealthy wing,
  And cons by fits and bits her evening trill.

  When passing o'er this streamlet,
    One fragrant morn in May,
  The meadows, wet with dewdrops,
    Shone bright at dawn of day;
  The crimson-breasted robin
    Was pouring forth his lay;
  The cuckoo's note of gladness
    Arose from scented spray.

  The mavis warbles loudly
    From yonder leafy tree;
  The wren now joins the chorus,
    And chirps aloud with glee;
  The linnet is preparing
    Her cheerfulness to show,
  While black-cocks greet their partners
    With cooing soft and low.

"bird tides."

  The linnet's warble, sinking towards a close,
  Hints to the thrush 'tis time for their repose;
  The shrill-voiced thrush is heedless, and again
  The monitor revives his own sweet strain;
  But both will soon be mastered, and the copse
  Be left as silent as the mountain-tops,
  Ere some commanding star dismiss to rest
  The throng of rooks, that now from twig or nest,
  (After a steady flight on home-bound wings,
  And a last game of mazy hoverings
  Around their ancient grove) with cawing noise,
  Disturb the liquid music's equipoise.

  Whirl through the evening sky.

  Where clove carnations overgrow the places where they were set,
  And, mist-like, in the intervening spaces creeps mignonette.

SIGNS OF RAIN.

  The hollow winds begin to blow,
  The clouds look black, the glass is low,
  The soot falls down, the spaniels sleep,
  The spiders from their cobwebs creep,
  Last night the sun went pale to bed,
  The moon in halo hid her head,
  The boding shepherd heaves a sigh,
  For see! a rainbow spans the sky.
  The walls are damp, the ditches smell,
  Clos'd is the pink ey'd pimpernel.
  Hark! how the chairs and tables crack;
  Old Betty's joints are on the rack.
  Loud quack the ducks, the peacocks cry,
  The distant hills are looking nigh.
  How restless are the snorting swine!
  The busy flies disturb the kine.
  Low o'er the grass the swallow wings;
  The cricket, too, how loud it sings.
  Puss on the hearth, with velvet paws,
  Sits smoothing o'er her whiskered jaws.
  Through the clear stream the fishes rise,
  And nimbly catch the incautious flies.
  The sheep are seen at early light
  Cropping the meads with eager bite.
  Tho' June, the air is cold and chill;
  The mellow blackbird's voice is still.
  The glow-worms, numerous and bright,
  Illumed the dewy dell last night.
  At dusk the squalid toad was seen
  Hopping, crawling, o'er the green.
  The frog has lost his yellow vest,
  And in a dingy suit is dress'd.
  The leech disturb'd is newly risen
  Quite to the summit of his prison.
  The whirling winds the dust obeys,
  And in the rapid eddy plays.
  My dog, so altered in his taste,
  Quits mutton bones on grass to feast;
  And see yon rooks, how odd their flight,
  They imitate the gliding kite,
  Or seem precipitate to fall,
  As if they felt the piercing ball.
  'Twill surely rain--I see with sorrow,
  Our jaunt must be put off to-morrow.

MIDSUMMER FAIRIES.

  And golden daffodils, plucked for May's queen;

  And hyacinth, long since a fair youth seen,
  Whose tuneful voice, turned fragrance in his breath,
  Kissed by sad zephyr, guilty of his death.

  The little birds are piping yet
  Among the bushes and the trees;
  There's a cuckoo, and one or two thrushes,
  And a far-off wind that rushes,
  And a sound of water that gushes,
  And the cuckoo's sovereign cry
  Fills all the hollow of the sky,
  Who would "go parading,"
  In London "and masquerading,"
  On such a night in June,
  With the beautiful soft half-moon,
  And all these innocent blisses?

  All impatient to be on the wing,
  And to wander from us, seeking
  Their beloved Spring.

  Stumbling on melons, as I pass,
  Insnared with flowers, I fall on grass.

  Autumn, among her drooping marigolds,
  Weeps all her garnered fields and empty folds
  And dripping orchards, plundered and forlorn.

  Winking at the blushing trees,

    Of the southward flying swallow.
  Sweet and smiling are thy ways,
  Beauteous, golden, Autumn days!

  Shivering, quivering, tearful days,
    Fretfully and sadly weeping;
  Dreading still, with anxious gaze,
    Icy fetters round thee creeping;
  O'er the cheerless, withered plain,
    Woefully and hoarsely calling;
  Pelting hail and drenching rain,
    On thy scanty vestments falling.
  Sad and mournful are thy ways,

  He nerves the limbs that are lazy grown,
    And braces the languid sinew;
  So while we have voices and lungs to cheer,
    And the winter frost before us,
  Come chant to the king of the mortal year,
    And thunder him out in chorus.

  "Decay, decay," the wildering west winds cry;
  "Decay, decay," the moaning woods reply;
  The whole dead autumn landscape, drear and chill,
  Strikes the same chord of desolate sadness still.

Full moon in October without frost, no frost till full moon in November.

NOVEMBER 1ST. (_All Saints' Day._)

  On All Saints' Day hard is the grain.
  The leaves are dropping, the puddle is full,
  At setting off in the morning
  Woe to him that will trust a stranger.

  On All Saints' Day blustering is the weather,
  Unlike the beginning of the past fair season:
  Besides God there is none that knows the future.

  Their loveliness of life and leaf

  The melancholy days are come, the saddest of the year,
  Of wailing winds, and naked woods, and meadows brown and sere;
  Heaped in the hollows of the grove, the withered leaves lie dead,
  They rustle to the eddying gust, and to the rabbit's tread.
  The robin and the wren are flown, and from the shrub the jay,
  And from the wood-tops calls the crow, through all the gloomy day.

  Sweet is the Summer's evening gale,
  And sweet the autumnal winds that shake

  The silence of the wintry scene,
  When Nature shrouds herself, entranced
    In deep tranquillity.

OF GARDENS.

I do hold it, in the royal ordering of gardens, there ought to be
gardens for all the months in the year, in which, severally, things of
beauty may be then in season.

For December and January, and the latter part of November, you must
take such things as are green all winter, holly, ivy, bays, juniper,
cypress trees, yew, pines, fir trees, rosemary, lavender, periwinkle,
the white, the purple, and the blue; germander, flags, orange trees,
lemon trees, and myrtles, if they be stoved; and sweet marjoram, warm
set.

       *       *       *       *       *

  If frost do continue, take this for a law,
  The strawberries look to be covered with straw,
  Laid overly trim upon crotches and bows,
  And after uncovered, as weather allows.
  The gilliflower also, the skilful do know,
  Doth look to be covered in frost and in snow:
  The knot and the border, and rosemary gay,
  Do crave the like succour, for dying away.

DECEMBER 5TH. (_St. Nicholas's Eve._)

St. Nicholas, besides being the patron of children, was supposed to
have provided marriage portions for portionless maidens.

  Saint Nicholas money used to give to maidens secretlie,
  Who, that he still may use his wonted liberalitie,
  The mothers all their children on the eve do cause to fast,
  And, when they every one at night in senseless sleepe are cast,
  Both apples, nuttes, and peares they bring, and other things beside,
  As caps, and shooes and petticotes, which secretlie they hide,
  And in the morning found, they say, that this Saint Nicholas brought:
  Thus tender mindes to worship Saints, and wicked things are taught.

  No longer floats the thistle-down;
  The crimson heath is wan and sere;
  The sedge hangs withering by the mere,
  And the broad fern is rent and brown.

  The owl sits huddling by himself,
  The cold has pierced his body through;
  The patient cattle hang their head;
  The deer are 'neath their winter shed;
  The ruddy squirrel's in his bed,
  And each small thing within its burrow.

  And when 'tis safely kept, the fiend

Childermas Day, and what soever day that falls on, whether on the
Monday, or Tuesday, or any other, nothing must be begun on that day

NEW YEAR'S EVE.

  Hark, the cock crows, and yon bright star
  Tells us the day himself's not far;
  And see where, breaking from the night,
  He gilds the western hills with light.

  With him old Janus doth appear,
  Peeping into the future year,
  With such a look as seems to say,
  The prospect is not good that way.

  If New Year's Eve night wind blows south
  It betokeneth warmth and growth;
  If west, much milk, and fish in the sea;
  If north, much cold and storms there will be;
  If east, the trees will bear much fruit;
  If north-east, flee it man and brute.

       *       *       *       *       *

  The New Year, with its yet unacted history,
    Claims the homage of our last departing chime;

    Of the youngest and the freshest birth of Time.

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing

that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
