Greeting

  Time was, is, and will be. Almanacks
  have come and Almanacks
  have gone. But Time has survived.
  Only the Foolish Almanack
  has been equal to the pleasant
  Task of Killing it.

HELPFUL HINT FOR JANUARY:


Do not give way to vain regrets because you did not keep the
good resolves you made a year ago. It might be worse. You
might have kept the resolutions and have had no incentive
for leading a better life this year.

ECLIPSES FOR THE COMING YEAR

If there are as many Eclipses as during 1905-6, it will be a
hard year on grafters and bosses. The editor is optimistic,
however, believing that the sanitary revolution which swept
the country has about blown over. Public confidence and
laxity have been restored in a large measure and the time is
now about ripe for us to get it in the neck again.

Note: We demanded a diagram for the above and the author
reluctantly provided it. He thinks that any one should know
that _Me._ is the abbreviation for Maine and that to make
the 2d and last lines rhyme you will readily read _Pe._ as
abbreviation for _pain_ and _Age._ as abbreviation for
_again_. We feel much better now and we hope you do, dear
reader.--_The Editor._

FORECAST FOR JANUARY


From January 1st until the 7th, and possibly in some cases
until the 9th or 10th, it will be very DRY. This drouth will
be followed by a long wet spell. The Zodiacal sharp who runs
things during January is Aquarius, which being translated
means "water-wagon." The only folks who never heard of
Aquarius live in the corn-belt of Kentucky.

       *       *       *       *       *

From January 10th to the 15th, the weather will devote its
time to making up its mind what it is going to do. From the
15th to the 20th it will do it.

       *       *       *       *       *

Dark clouds of remorse and despondency will reign during the
last week in January, but by February 1st you will have
become accustomed and resigned to your old habits.

[Illustration]

January will also be marked by "white goods sales," and (if
it's windy in the shopping district) skirt sails.

            (2001) It was decided to build a lock-sea-level
                   canal instead.

TUESDAY     (3000 A.D.) At a quiet meeting, Daughters of

                   unanimously.

Why a Kentucky "Colonel" is a "good Judge."

                   stone before delivering his address on

FRIDAY      (1906) T. Roosevelt began publishing a series

FOR THE HOME COMING


Before meeting his wife and family at the station a wise man
will put his house in order for the home coming.

       *       *       *       *       *

A pleasant way of doing this is to give a house-cleaning
party. Divide your party into the Sweepers, the Dusters, the
Scrubbers, and the Dish Washers, giving each group proper
utensils and offering a prize for the best results.

       *       *       *       *       *

Let the party begin at midnight, after a pleasant dinner,
and at about 2 in the morning the police will probably come
in and finish cleaning the place up.

that he was made President. And very few men get into office

HOW TO SKATE


February is perhaps as good a month as any other to learn to
skate.

The simplest, and most approved method, is as follows:

One high-ball, another high-ball, 1 more high-ball, simply a
high-ball, just one more high-ball, ditto, the same, and
lastly, a highball. (Note--After the glass is full say, "Not
another drop.")

You will be surprised at the ease with which you can skate.

       *       *       *       *       *

"Spreading the Eagle" is a very pretty and artistic skating
figure. It is done by trying to get from one side of the
street to the other all in the same night.

       *       *       *       *       *

"Looping the lamp-post" is also quite an achievement in
skating. It doesn't make any difference which of the two
lamp-posts you loop--take your choice. It is difficult to
give directions how to do this. The feat has to be seen to
be learned. There is a simpler way of doing it, however, and
that is--stand perfectly still while the lamp-post passes
around you.

       *       *       *       *       *

Two persons skating together for mutual assistance are known
as "a pair of skates."

       *       *       *       *       *

An expert skater can skate just as well in July as in
February.

HOW TO COMPOSE A SHORT STORY


"Ambitious" asks the compiler of this Almanack to tell her
the easiest way to compose a short story.

       *       *       *       *       *

This depends somewhat on the short story, but a few general
observations may be of interest. Some short stories are more
excited than others.

       *       *       *       *       *

Lead the short story to a quiet place and soothe it by
praise delivered in a gentle, monotonous, but authoritative
tone of voice. Be careful not to criticize, as that will
make it more and more nervous. When the short story shows
signs of yielding to this influence, smooth it gently with
one hand and pat it on the back with the other. When quite
composed, withdraw quietly, still speaking in a low tone.

       *       *       *       *       *

A short story by Mary Wilkins can be composed more quickly
than a short story by Kipling. In the latter case it may be
necessary to gently persuade the short story to take an
opiate.

HELPFUL HINT FOR MARCH


Now is a good time to think about having your last summer's
suit and hat cleaned and fixed up to last another season.
You can stand at the window and look out at the snow, and
think about this to your heart's content. This probably will
warm you to such an extent that you will save a bit on your
coal bill.

HOW TO HANDLE A MUCK-RAKE

The owner of a muck-rake should first get a magazine to keep
it in. This practice originated with Laws Tomson, the
celebrated Norse Berserker.

Select your muck and rake it diligently until you find a
large, fat check; then leave that pile and begin on another.

SPRING, GENTLE SPRING


One life-size morning nearly six thousand years ago Jubal
sat outside of dear old Eden, whanged his harp and warbled
the following:

  "Gentle Spring has come at last,
  So keep your furnace fires full blast!"

       *       *       *       *       *

It was thus that Spring was invented, also the first Spring
poet. But why Spring should appeal to humanity as a season
of romance, no one who gives this problem serious thought
can imagine.

       *       *       *       *       *

It was in the Spring that poor old Adam first had to work,
and from that time on we have had that tired feeling in the
Spring. (See footnote.)

       *       *       *       *       *

It was also in the Spring that Eve wearied of her fig-leaf
toque. She stuck a couple lyre bird tails in one side, three
lotos buds in the other, and that settled it. Ever since man
has had to hustle in the Spring to get his wife a new hat.
(See footnote.)

       *       *       *       *       *

It was in the Spring that Cain moved. That became a habit
with humanity and knocked more romance out of Spring.

       *       *       *       *       *

GEOGRAPHICAL NOTES


The principal river of Egypt is the Nile. Its smaller
tributaries are the juveniles.

The capital of Ireland seems destined to have the largest
population of any city in the world. It's D'ublin, every
year.

The United States are best for married people.

Americans are noted for being fond of jokes. Their country
was originally named for A-merry-cus. (Vespucchi.)

When the flood subsided it is probable that Noah and his
family landed in the vicinity of Little Rock, for we are
given to understand that he came forth from the Ark-an'-saw
land.

Those who say that constancy is not a feminine quality

HINTS TO AMATEUR GARDENERS


In the spring look after your potatoes carefully. Have their
eyes examined by a good oculist, and provide spectacles for
such as need them.

       *       *       *       *       *

Never string your beans till they are old enough to
understand it. If you begin too early, they are apt to lose
their temper.

       *       *       *       *       *

Don't attempt to graft your pie-plants. Many have tried
grafting a custard to a mince, in the hope that the brandy
in the latter would assimilate with the custard and make a
Tom and Jerry, but it never works.

       *       *       *       *       *

Before planting your punkins, carefully remove the punk.

       *       *       *       *       *

If you have any difficulty harvesting the fruit of your
boot-tree, use a boot-jack.

       *       *       *       *       *

Owing to the well-known fact that the mongoose is the deadly
foe of snakes, it is thought that the best way to
exterminate them from your garden is to cultivate the
mon-gooseberry. Try it.

       *       *       *       *       *

The mint-julep does not belong to the tulip family, although
the latter has a strong affinity for it.

AN APRIL PASTEL


There is no better spring month in which to move than April.
Look among your papers and if you don't find a rent receipt
for March you will know that it's your move. Plant an elm
tree on Arbor day--it may grow up to be the tree under which
Gen. Washington stopped to rest when he was pursuing the
British--who knows! The farmer will do well to apply
fertilizer to his land this month. There is no better
fertilizer on the market than Limburger cheese. It costs
considerable, but a little of it will inoculate a large
area.

Have you ever thought how much money you waste in paying
rent? Now that you are about to sign a new lease, it is time
to ponder this subject. Say you pay $50 a month rent. That
is $600 a year. Think! If you should pay rent for two
thousand years you would waste as much money as Pierpont
Muchgain makes on a little deal in railroads of a dull
afternoon.

From the 1st to the 10th spring house-cleaning will take
place. Look out for soft soap on the stairs. Meals will be
served to gentlemen down town. There is no place like home
during spring house-cleaning--this is why home is so
generally avoided during that period.

       *       *       *       *       *

From the 10th to the 20th buds will burst with deafening

HELPFUL HINT FOR MAY


The careful wife and mother will find a most excellent plan
for utilizing a spring bonnet of the vintage of 1906 will be
to tell her husband that she will make it do another season.
Then manage to be out in the rain with it on, and with no
umbrella. Further instruction is unnecessary.

       *       *       *       *       *

TIMELY HINTS

A great many cows come in fresh in May. If you have a good
calf, wear open-work hose and don't be ashamed to show it on
a rainy day. Plant beans, pumpkins, and squashes about May
20th, but don't mix the seed. This is also a good month to
set hens on door-knobs, and old ink-bottles, thus playing a
great joke on the hens.

Getting rich is a simple matter if one goes about it right.
If you will deposit one penny in the bank on the first day
of the month and double each deposit each day thereafter,
until the end of the month (30 days), you will find yourself
rich beyond the dreams of avarice. Thus:--

LITTLE STUDIES IN NATURAL HISTORY


_The Secretary-bird, or Loebriole._

This little creature belongs to the "Knowitall" class and
has no fear, often perching on the "Big Stick" itself. His
distinguishing characteristic is a thick oak board where
most birds wear tail-feathers. He only sings when there is a
storm coming, and then his song has a plaintive note as he
warbles "Ki-yi, blame it on me."

_How to Make Credit Grow._

Select a choice "bluff." Prepare this carefully, for the
size of the credit depends entirely upon the general
appearance of the bluff. When you think the bluff is strong
enough, take it to a bank. If it goes there, you will have
no further trouble. Your credit is now ready to transplant.
Should it begin to droop, give it a check. Be careful not to
use too many, for the proper use of the credit-plant is to
enable its owner to live without money.

DECKLE-EDGE FRECKLES


Summer begins June 20. By this time your freckles ought to
have a good start.

       *       *       *       *       *

Do you know what a freckle is, children? It is a
golden-brown splash on the northwest corner of a young
woman's nose, although her dearest friend says it is a
fright.

       *       *       *       *       *

A freckle is the same to a druggist as a pipe line is to
Rockefeller--ready money and a lot of it.

       *       *       *       *       *

One large deckle-edge freckle will cause a girl to buy nine
kinds of cold cream, a dozen lemons, a pint of three-ply
acid, and a gross of poudre-de-phiz every Saturday
afternoon.

       *       *       *       *       *

All this gives vigor to the freckle.

WEDNESDAY   (1904) It was reported that Cassie Chadwick

                   the Interstate Commerce Commission to
                   issue an injunction against them under
                   the plea of restraint of trade. The
                   injunction was issued, and withdrawn
                   later when the Supreme Court decided
                   that confidence was too universal to be
                   made the basis of a monopoly.

RAISING CORN


Great care should be exercised in raising corn, especially
the variety _Johnus Barley-cornicus_. This may be raised
with either hand. Some superstitious agriculturists believe
in the efficacy of a simple incantation to be used in the
act of raising this variety, such as "Here's how!" "Over the
hot sands!" etc.

[Illustration]

This kind has never been known to fail in getting to a head.
"Kernels" of Barleycorn originated in Kentucky.

HOW TO PLANT A BEER GARDEN


Now is the time for the ruddy faced beer gardener to lay out
his beer garden. First procure a license and a few nice
rustic chairs and tables. Next extract the seeds from a
couple of seedy old suits and get your wife to sew them.
Your barber will gladly supply you with cuttings, or, if you
have the chance, unscrew a dozen or so bulbs from some
healthy young electric light plant.

       *       *       *       *       *

With ordinary summer weather you should soon have a blooming
fine lot of Anheuser bushes. As soon as the "buds" begin to
pop, pack the roots with ice. Care should be taken to keep
the plants from drying out.

       *       *       *       *       *

Bottle flies, while annoying, do no real injury to the
plant, and a judicious use of fly-paper will hold them in
check.

       *       *       *       *       *

In weeding, the beer gardener should be careful to
distinguish between true widow's weeds and grass widow's
weeds. The latter not only add color and beauty to the
garden, but also give life to the plant.

       *       *       *       *       *

Beer was never worn so much or used so extensively for
interior decoration as it is today. There is a ready market
for it at five cents a small bunch, and with intelligent
grafting the bearing of the plant can be increased tenfold.

[Sidenote: _THERMOMETER ECONOMY_: This is the best time to

the house has been placed in a cold storage vault. A cat
loves its favorite corner when it is mentally disquieted.

 3. Photographers and correspondents were not allowed to
inspect the officers' wardrobes.

 4. There was no San Juan Hill.

 5. The officers gave no afternoon teas, dinners, or balls.

 6. The officers looked after their commands instead of
writing magazine articles.

 7. The soldiers were fed real food.

 8. Thousands upon thousands of soldiers were killed.

 9. The ships sunk in the naval battle were sunk in deep

SUNDAY    A GREAT JAG

NUT CUTLET

Procure two dozen new nuts from any hardware shop. Grind
them into a paste of about the consistency of the average
politician. Over this pour a little Standard Oil from which
the dividends have been removed, and stir briskly with a
subpoena till the oil begins to run; pour off, strain, and
beat the paste with an axe until it looks and tastes like a
veal cutlet.

To cure seasickness: Turn the entire system inside out and
hang it over the rail of the ship where the salt spray can
drench it. Under this treatment the patient is pretty sure
to feel somewhat relieved within a few days after the time
of going ashore.

       *       *       *       *       *

Persons troubled with poor circulation should ascertain how
to increase the same by consulting the editor of their
favorite Sunday newspaper.

Weak respiration may be improved by a diet of onions. They
are highly recommended for strengthening the breath.

       *       *       *       *       *

For insomnia try snoring, which is always a symptom of SOUND
sleep.

       *       *       *       *       *

To prevent hay fever: Go not in the way of the kittenish
grass widow.

LITTLE STUDIES IN NATURAL HISTORY


_How to Trim Rich Relations._

This is a very dangerous and delicate operation as the
subjects can only be approached when they are asleep.

Provide yourself with a black-jack, a bottle of chloroform
and a sponge. About three in the morning enter the room
where the Richest Relation is sleeping. Going noiselessly to
the bed, hold the sponge saturated with chloroform above the
Richest Relation's nose. As his sleep becomes more profound,
lower the sponge, and finally, with a quick motion, jam it
in his mouth. Then strike his head with the black-jack,
using all your strength. Rich Relations are suspicious and
you cannot be too careful in business matters. This done,
cut out the gold, silver, or bills, from his pockets, and
any jewels or trinkets that you may find.

Note: In most cases it will not be necessary to kill the
subject before you can do the trimming.

RECIPE FOR MAKING PUMPKIN PIE


THE KIND THAT MOTHER DIDN'T USED TO MAKE

(Copyrighted)

First get your pumpkin. Then kill it and skin it. Cut
pumpkin into small hunks with an axe. Boil the hunks. Boil
them some more. Continue to boil hunks until they become a
mucky gob. Unless you produce a mucky gob, the pie will be
lumpy. Add fresh picked eggs to common cow's milk. Beat the
eggs. They may be hard to beat, but beat them. Use a carpet
beater if necessary. Now pinch the salt and add the pinch.
Add a dash of cinnamon, add a few nutmegs (whole); these
will give the pie that rich, nutty flavor so much desired.
Add three-fourths cup of molasses. Do not add mustard--this
is not a mustard plaster, it is a pie. Now add this mixture
to the mucky gob. Stir until thoroughly mixed. Let stand
while you give your pie-pans a coat of crust. Then pour
mixture into pie-pans until they slop over. Place in a hot
oven. When you can't stick a fork into the pies, they are
done. Remove pies from oven and place on the back piazza to
cool. If the dog likes them, they're all right.

Do not put brandy in your mince pies. It spoils it--the

We cannot speak too strongly against the pernicious habit of
doctoring mince meat with brandy. It lures men on. The first
baleful bite rouses the appetite, and soon they will be
eating mince pie after mince pie all day, and eventually be
laid up with indigestion. And even the aggressive clove
curls up and faints when ordered to disguise a mince pie
breath.

same. Another way to relieve cold feet is to get out of the
game. From the 9th to the 16th there will be hard sledding

HOW TO VIEW AN ECLIPSE


To properly view an eclipse to its full, a party of several
good spirits should get together. Whether an eclipse of the
sun or the moon, each should take a glass and smoke it. A
great deal depends on the quality and character of the
glass. Some glasses are much more certain to reveal an
eclipse than are others.

       *       *       *       *       *

If the first glass when properly smoked does not show the
eclipse, try another and a stronger one. It is very probable
that this glass will show the sun or the moon in the throes
of an eclipse. Still another glass will show two suns or two
moons. The third glass is likely to show several moons and
several suns, fixed stars and those that need fixing, comets
and milky ways, sky-rockets and pin-wheels, all combining to
eclipse the finest display of Fourth of July fireworks ever
projected by the mind of man.

       *       *       *       *       *

And when the beholder of this mighty spectacle wakes up
during the afternoon of the following day and sees but one
simple unadorned sun doing business in the whole expanse of
the broad, blue heavens, he has a feeling of pity for all
those who retired early the night before and missed the
social, spiritual, and educative uplift that comes from
viewing an eclipse under just the proper conditions.

HELPFUL HINT FOR DECEMBER


Now, do not show your resentment toward those who forgot to
send you presents last Christmas. Send each of them a little
remembrance--but be sure to select something that will force
them to spend forty or fifty dollars to take care of it or
to surround it with the proper atmosphere. This is much
better than mailing a post card and letting it go at that.

It is a deplorable fact that human
vision is falling below the normal
standard day by day. A great many
people weaken their eyes by looking
for work, others in trying to see a
joke where there is no joke.

Our patent home eye tester is
presented herewith. Why pay
good money to an oculist when you
can test your eyes yourself?

DIRECTIONS FOR USING EYE-TESTER

     Hold black disc and parallel lines 18
     inches in front of your eyes. Close
     your eyes and look at diagram intently.
     If, then, any one line in the diagram
     seems to you to be more alike than any
     other line, or if any one line looks to
     be more parallel than two lines, you
     ought to wear spectacles.

FARMING IN ALASKA


It is encouraging to note that farming in our far Northwest
possessions is on the boom. [Note to printer--be careful not
to make "bum" out of "boom."] A bulletin issued by the
Agricultural Department of our government, just as we go to
press, shows that there are at present in Alaska 12 farms,
four oxen, 13 cows, 176 chickens, 10 pigs, several cases of
pneumonia and numerous games of "freeze-out." During the
fiscal year there was harvested in Alaska $165 worth of hay,
$95 worth of eggs and poultry, and a big crop of ice. There
are certain advantages of farming in Alaska. In harvest
time, for instance, a man never sweats at work. He markets
his milk frozen and sells it by the hunk. You never hear of
anybody crying over spilt milk in Alaska. It's the same way
with eggs--no cold storage needed; the eggs are frozen
before they are layed, thus retaining their fine, fresh
flavor until used. You never hear of an egg passing from the
sublime to the ridiculous stage in Alaska.

       *       *       *       *       *

Farmers in Alaska plow with ice-picks and shoot the seed
into the soil with a double-barreled shotgun. The 12 farmers
in Alaska held a farmers' institute recently to talk over
prospects for the current year. Basing prospects on $165
worth of hay raised last year, they figure that if
conditions are favorable they will raise $175 worth this
year.

THE PUBLISHER'S COZY CORNER CHAT

ONE OF OUR AWFUL SMART BOYS


Little George Hathadash lives in Megawolloppey, Maine, and
is now three years old.

This brave ruddy-cheeked boy immediately took the
Megawolloppey agency for the "Saturday Evening Roast,"
feeling sure that his ruddy cheek would carry him through
successfully. Next Sunday, when everybody was gathered in
church, who should come toddling down the aisle but George
Hathadash distributing his first bundle of "Roasts," just as
he had seen the train boy sell candy on a train of cars.
"Better and brighter than any thermon," cried George
Hathadash in his childish treble. "Here's your 'Thaturday
Evening Roast,' the brother-in-law of the 'Ladies' Wall
Paper.' Better and brighter than any thermon."

Of course that attracted attention, and almost before he
knew it George had disposed of his whole bundle and
established himself in business. He is now well on his way
to win the beautiful prize of a silver carving knife that
the "Roast" offers as an extra inducement to its hustling
young salesmen.

There are other prizes and any boy with a good ruddy cheek
is likely to get one of them.

But all boys are not like George Hathadash. We think _he_ is
going to be a President of the Common Council.

ADVICE TO PARENTS


It is now pretty generally believed that the name given to
one to bear with him night and day, during all his years,
has a most important influence in the work of shaping his
life and fortune.

       *       *       *       *       *

No doubt a careful investigation of the subject would show
that most of the bare-pated men of the nation are so because
while they were still helpless little children they were
named Archibald, Theobald, Baldwin, and the like, whereas,
had they been named Harry, or Harold, or Aaron, they would
still be blest with well-thatched polls.

       *       *       *       *       *

It is the bounden duty of parents to determine the business
or profession in which they intend their children shall
engage. If they wish their son to become a fancy
poultry-breeder they should name him Egbert or Henry; if
they wish him to become a surgeon they should call him
Lancelot; if an arithmetician, Adam; if a clown, Guy or
Joshua; if a street car driver, Oscar; if a real estate
dealer, Lot or Orlando; if a man of wealth, Richard; if a
debtor, Owen; and if they wish him to "go to grass,"
Timothy.

       *       *       *       *       *

The same degree of thoughtful care should be exercised in
naming girls, as well. If a girl is to become a musician she
should be called Octavia or Dora; if a milliner, Hattie; if
a writer, Adaline; if a cook, Dinah or Amelia; and so on to
the end of the chapter.

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
