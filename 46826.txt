THE COMPLIMENTS OF THE SEASON

(_Founded upon the Farce of Christmas Cards._)

Scene--_A London Drawing Room._ PATERFAMILIAS _discovered reading a
paper, and_ MATERFAMILIAS _superintending the despatch of a number of
cards_.

_Mater._ (_in a tone of irritation_). I really think, JOHN, that,
considering you have nothing earthly to do this afternoon, you might
come and help me.

_Pater._ You have said that twice before, my dear. Don't you see I am
enjoying myself?

_Mater._ So like you! As if you couldn't give up that stupid paper--you
declare there's no news in it--and do me a favour!

_Pater._ (_putting down his paper_). Well, anything for a quiet life!
What is it?

_Mater._ I am sending a card to Mrs. BROWN.

_Pater._ (_taking up his paper again_). Send it.

_Mater._ My dear JOHN, _do_ attend. I want to know what I shall put
into the envelope.

_Pater._ (_giving up paper, and examining Christmas Cards with some
vague show of interest_). Oh, well--here. (_Casually picking up a
picture of a country churchyard by moonlight_). Won't this be the sort
of thing?

_Mater._ (_shocked_). How _can_ you, John! Don't you know that Mrs.
Brown lost her husband only a year ago?

_Pater._ Then why are you wishing her "A Merry Christmas"?

_Mater._ Well, you see she has married again, and so I thought of
sending her something with "A Happy New Year" in it.

_Pater._ (_taking up a card showing an owl in an ivy bush_). Why not
this?

_Mater._ Well that would be better, but then she might think that the
owl was intended for a sneer at her second husband. And then I always
like to keep the happy new year cards till Christmas is over, as you
can send them afterwards to the people who have remembered you when you
have forgotten them.

_Pater._ But you wouldn't have "A Merry Christmas," and now you object
to "A Happy New Year." What _do_ you want?

_Mater._ Can't you get something impersonal?

_Pater._ (_taking up card_). Well, here's a yacht in full sail.

_Mater._ Oh, _how_ cruel! It will remind her of her cousin who was lost
at sea!

_Pater._ (_selecting another sketch_). Then why not this bouquet of
flowers?

_Mater._ Not for worlds! One never knows what the flowers may mean, and
we might offend her.

_Pater._ (_trying again_). Well, here is a windmill.

_Mater._ My dear John, you are absolutely provoking. A windmill is
suggestive of frivolity, and I wouldn't let Mrs. Brown think that we
meant _that_ on any account.

_Pater._ (_making another selection_). Well, here's a parrot in a cage.

_Mater._ You surely are not serious? Fancy sending such a card! Why, as
everyone knows that dear Mrs. BROWN is rather talkative, all the world
would say it was an "insult."

_Pater._ (_losing patience_). Oh, hang Mrs. BROWN!

_Mater._ I am ashamed of you, JOHN! And I suppose you would hang the
cards, too! You would curse "Merry Christmas."

_Pater._ (_promptly_). That I would, and what is more, I would--well
never mind--the glad New Year!

THREE CHRISTMAS GREETINGS.

  Before the fireside's ruddy glow
    I sit, and let my thoughts fly free;
  Lo, these my Christmas greetings go
    To three good friends beyond the sea.
  Vain is the winter tempest's wrack,
  It cannot keep my greetings back.

  Oh wind and rain, and rain and wind,
    How purposeless and blind ye are,
  Like fate, for fate was surely blind
    That bade my three friends range afar.
  Like mine, perchance, their fancy strays
  To other scenes and distant days.

  Dear FRANK, I think I see you now,
    My flaxen-haired American,
  Brave heart, grey eye, unclouded brow,
    Two stalwart yards of wilful man,
  How oft in laughter and in song
  With you I sped the hours along.

  Ah me, the days were all too short,
    Too swift the unreturning hours
  In that old town of Hall and court,
    Of ancient gateways flanked with towers,
  Where once we feared the near exam...
  And dared the dons, and stirred the Cam.

  You went, and now expound the law
    (As _Bumble_ said, the law's a hass)
  And argue, as I note with awe,
    For litigants in Boston, Mass.;
  And, though you wear no warlike suit,
  They call you "General" to boot.

  And, FRED, how fares it now with you
    In that drear country of the North?
  Too great your needs, your means too few,
    A whim of temper drove you forth.
  On far Vancouver's shore, alone
  You hear the sad Pacific moan.

  With us, God wot, you little throve;
    Your life all fire, and storm, and fret,
  Against relentless fate you strove,
    But strove in vain--and yet, and yet
  God shapes in storm and fire his plan,
  And moulds a world or makes a man.

  Good luck be yours on that bleak shore,
    Some fortunate, some golden prize;
  Then be it mine to see once more
    Those friendly, lustrous, Irish eyes.
  Return and face with us your fate,
  The world is small and England great.

  You shall return and fill your place,
    But never shall I clasp his hand,
  Whose bright and smiling boyish face
    Makes sunshine in the shadowland.
  Yet shall the night my heart beguile,
  And let me dream I see him smile.

  Your voice I may not hear again,
    Oh dear and unforgotten friend,
  Beloved, but ah! beloved in vain,
    Whom love could mourn, but not defend.
  Still take, though far and lost you dwell,
  My love, dear HUGH, and so farewell.

  And thus before the fireside's glow
    I sit and let my thoughts fly free;
  Lo, these my Christmas greetings go
    To three good friends beyond the sea;
  To FRANK, to FRED, and ah, to you,
  Beloved, irrevocable HUGH.

TO PHILADELPHIA.

_To Resolve his Doubt._

  I have no passion to bestow,
    My heart no more can beat
  Like the caged bird that to and fro
    Flutters your hand to greet.

  In a sad peace no raptures stir
    My twilight years have set,
  Embalming but in bitter myrrh
    All I cannot forget.

  When hope is dead, and sweet desire
    And love's brief April rains,
  Only the spirit to inquire
    Unconquered still remains.

  'Tis that that bows my soul; although
    I'm prostrate at your feet,
  Only because I want to know--
    That's why I ask you, sweet!

title would have been _Fore-Newnes at the Zoo_.

A DOG ON HIS DAY.

(_A Pitiful Epistle from Pongo to Mr. Punch at Christmastide._)

  Every dog has his day--so they say,--
    And mine it seems comes round once a year.
  When all the painter fellows mix their blacks and browns and yellows,
    And paint me, in some attitude that's queer,
  And unnatural, and silly; spilling milk or supping skilly;
  With a bonnet or a bib on, or tied up in bows of ribbon!
  Oh, the Dogs' "Decline and Fall" might inspire a doggish Gibbon!
  And they make me most unhappy, and my temper sharp and snappy,
  Do these pictures poor and pappy. I'm a decent doggish chappie,
  But in gaudy Christmas Numbers, watching o'er the sloppy slumbers
  Of a baby pink and podgy; or squatting scared and stodgy,
  Like a noodle of a poodle--oh! its really wretched foodle!--
    At a beetle or a frog staring wildly, in a fog,
  Or lapping baby's custard, or refusing baby's mustard,
  Or dress'd up like a guy, or winking t'other eye,
  In a gown, trimmed with down, like a clown,
          Or coquetting with a cat,
          Or chasing that old rat
  Down that everlasting hole in the stable! On my soul,
  A dog as is a dog, and not a duffer,
  When the Yuletide pictures come is bound to suffer
  Endless agonies of shame at the loss of his good name
  As the sonsie friend of man, and a watchful guar-di-an,
          _Not_ an adjunct of the nursery!
          At this happy anniversary
                (_Mr. Punch_)
                I could cr-r-r-runch!
  The daubers who malign me, and such stupid _roles_ assign me.
          _Why, it's worse than hydrophoby!!!_
          _Mr. Punch_, do turn on Toby,
  As our champion canine to request each painter chap
  To turn off the old stale tap of the porridge and the pap, and the
      baby in the cap, or the kid (who needs a slap) and the pug (not
      worth a rap) in an apoplectic nap, the toy-terrier on the snap, or
      a-sniffing at a trap, or essaying milk to lap, like a small
          pot-bellied
      Jap; and all the old clap-trap
  Which makes a decent doggy in sheer desperation say
  That he'd rather be a kitten with a ball and string to play,
  Or live on clockwork rats, or make breakfast on chopped hay,
  Or be smeared all o'er with mustard like a cold beef sandwich,--Aye!
  Or--_whisper!_--Bite a Baby!!--on the nose!! in nursery play!!!
  Better dare renewed distemper than another Christmas Day!!
  For unless I have your promise--and dear Toby's--I much fear
  I must spend a pappy Christmas and a yappy New Year!

AN AFTERPART A LA L. C. C.

As the L. C. C. have taken in hand the morals of the music halls, and
shown an inclination to supersede the Lord Chamberlain, it may be as
well to publish a rough sketch of a specimen scene from the afterpart
of a pantomime for the guidance of theatrical managers desirous of
standing well with the successors to the members of the Metropolitan
Board of Works. The "opening" would, of course, be written by "a
serious bard with a mission." No doubt the story would be told in a
manner most productive to the manufacture of prigs. The transformation
over, Clown, Pantaloon, Harlequin and Columbine would be discovered in
a group.

_Clown_ (_in the conventional tone_). Here we are again!

_Bumble_ (_representing the L. C. C._). Scarcely. Allow me to point out
that in future you will be entirely different.

_Clown_ (_as before_). Come along, old'un; let's make a butter slide.

_Bumble._ You must permit me to interpose. The Council cannot recognise
any practical joke of the kind. If you wish to have the same sort of
fun, pull up the streets in the most frequented thoroughfares in the
metropolis--the Strand and Fleet Street for choice.

_Clown_ (_as before_). Oh, here's a baby! Let's smash it!

_Bumble._ Please accept my advice. The Council do not object to
the keeping down of babies in the abstract. But personal violence
is contrary to the law. If you really wish to decrease the surplus
population, why not work it to death at a board-school? It may be a
slower process than throwing it over a lamp-post, but the incident will
be truer to life, and therefore more convincing.

_Clown_ (_as before_). Oh! old 'un, here's a peeler coming!

_Bumble_. Pray be under no apprehension. Until the Police Force is
placed under the direct control of the Council, the members will do
their best to protect you. It stands to reason that a great community
like London should have its own guardians under its own direct control.

_Clown_ (_as before_). And now let's jump through this building.

_Bumble_. Again I must put my veto upon your proceedings. If you were
to jump through that wall no doubt a placard would appear bearing
the legend "Somersault Place." This might be apt, but no change in
the nomenclature of the streets can be permitted without the direct
sanction of Spring Gardens.

_Clown_ (_as before_). And now let's pelt this house, and all who's in
it!

_Bumble._ Stop, stop! You are attacking our own sacred building. (_To_
Harlequin). Will you be so good as to change the _locale_. (Harlequin
_strikes building, which turns into the Mansion House_.) Now you may do
what you please. For the Corporation of the City of London is so effete
that we have no sympathy for it!

THOSE LANCERS.

  Pretty partner, how are you
    After such a set of lancers?
  No one knowing what to do;
    We alone of sixteen dancers,
      Knew a figure, one or two.
      Pretty partner, how are you?

  Seven men and seven girls,
    All in such a fog together;
  One pair strides, and one pair twirls,
    Neither of them knowing whether
      That is what they ought to do,
      Pretty partner, not like you.

  You, who dance so very well,
    Slight, and light, and quite delightful,
  Belle who bears away the bell;
    We were forced to stop, how frightful!
      Yet I found one thing to do,
      Pretty partner--look at you.

  In that lamentable block,
    Some poor lout was sure to trample
  On the lace that trims your frock,
    Though the space of floor seemed ample
      Even for his feet which flew,
      Pretty partner, after you.

  Oh, the links of that "grand chain"
    In such desperate confusion!
  Feet, not hands, I met with pain,
    Stamps on toes, kick, bruise, contusion!
      Yet, alive, I've struggled through,
      Pretty partner, here with you.

  Figures! one alone was good,
    That was yours, so slim and charming.
  In your company I would
    Welcome bruises more alarming.
      I would dance till all was blue,
      Pretty partner, if with you.

AT THE WESTMINSTER PLAY

_Plaudite! Bravo! Brave! Domini Quippus et Punnus_ are very much
alive! A fact that may be inferred from just one line (there are more
whence this came) in the Westminsterial play, when _Davus_ takes
_Mysis_ "the New Woman," for his wife, and exclaims:--

  "O Mysis, Mysis, tu mea Missis eris!"

Surely if the punhating Criticus Sagitarius (Mundi) were
present he must have staggered out weeping on hearing the
Latin-Anglo-modern-classical pun! O shade of 'Arry Stophanes! O Ghost
of Terence (the Corkasian)! are our youths at Westminster to start
thus on their career, with nothing better than a poor pun not worth a
punny in their pockets! Let Sagitarius watch this youthful punster's
line of life! He will live to be punished! or to be rewarded as he
deserves? After all, Great Pun is not dead; he may be dull, commonplace
sometimes, but as he was prehistoric, so is he immortal. There is a
great future before the author of the Westminster epilogue.

  BORN NOVEMBER 13, 1850.
  DIED DECEMBER 8, 1894.

  Brave bringer-back of old Romance
    From shores so few may see,
  Who oft hath made our pulses dance
    With thy word-wizardry.
  We wished, who loved thee long and well,
  Thy life as endless as the spell
   Which lured us lingeringly
  To loiter, like a moon-witched stream,
  Through thine enchanted world of dream.

  We mused, with much-expectant smile,
    On that strange life afar,
  Flower-girt, in yon Pacific isle,
    Whereto an alien star
  Had drawn thee from thy northern home,
  Scourged by a greyer, chillier foam,
    Yet dear as the white bar
  Whose snowy break home-haven marks
  To battered shore-returning barks.

  And now across the sundering seas,
    Delayed, unwelcome, dread,
  Comes news that breaks our dreamful ease.
    The Great Romancer dead?
  It comes like an unnatural blight.
  That sunny vision quenched in night,
    That subtle spirit fled?
  One-half our best soul-life seems gone
  Out like a spark with STEVENSON.

  Enough for fame that hand had wrought,
    But not enough for those
  Who dreamed his dream, who thought his thought,
    And grieve that so should close
  Fresh-opened doors to Faeryland
  Before the poet-Prospero's wand
    Had wrought the spells he chose.
  Without _him_ amaranth-blooms to cull
  The world looks Stygian now, and dull.

  Teller of Tales, those southern folk
    Their _Tusitala_ hailed.
  Samoan hearts may mourn the stroke.
    We, who must leave unscaled,
  Save in fond fancy, that high peak
  Where he is tombed, who, though flesh-weak
    In spirit never failed
  More than his stalwart fathers,--we
  Send half our hearts across the sea.

  The lighthouse-builder raised no light
    That shall outshine the flame
  Of genius in its mellowest might
    That beacons him to fame.
  And Pala's peak shall do yet more
  Than the great light at Skerryvore
    To magnify his name,
  Who mourned, when stricken flesh would tire,
  That he was weaker than his sire.

  Teller of Tales! Of tales so told
    That all the world must list.
  Story sheer witchery, style pure gold,
    Yet with that tricksy twist
  Of Puck-like mockery which betrays
  The wanderer in this world's mad maze,
    Not blindly optimist,
  Who wooes Romance, yet sadly knows
  That Life's sole growth is _not_ the Rose.

  Dreamer of dreams! Such dreams as draw
    Glad through the Ivory Gate,
  In rapt and visionary awe,
    The soul alert, elate;
  Eblis obscure, Elysium dim,
  And a strange Limbo of wild whim,
    Upon us seem to wait,
  In solemn pomp, when willing thrall
  To him who held the keys of all.

  Thinker of thoughts, fresh, poignant, fine,
    Wherein no wit may trace
  That burthen of the Philistine,
    Chill, barren Commonplace.
  Who hath not felt the subtle stroke
  Which can in one choice phrase invoke
    The soul of charm and grace,
  Haunting the ear like an old rhyme,
  A cherished memory for all time?

  No more, no more! We shall not see
    Again the glorious show;
  No more will wake the wizardry,
    Nor the charmed music flow.
  Samoa's silence holds it hushed,
  The voice whereat our cheeks have flushed
    A hundred times; and lo!
  For happy hours, for haunted days,
  We can but pay with sad, proud praise!

CRACKERS.--TOM SMITH, the up-to-date magician, sends forth from his

least they won't remain so long, especially if any quiet demon of a
schoolboy with martial aspirations hears a report of "The Gatling Gun
Cracker." The repeating process will be an uncertain pleasure--to
others. Then "Snap Shots," taken unawares by a naughty little Cupid--we
can imagine the "Surprises!" Knick-knacks are boomed in "Ye Olde
Curiosity Shop"--but soft! I will not reveal any further the secrets of
the "King of Crackers." Get them--they are an "Open Sesame" to a gaiety
of delights.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.

A Baronitess junior sends word from the children's quarters that _Your
Fortune and Character_ is an amusing game, told by WILLIAM SHAKSPEARE,
but published by JOHN JAQUES & CO.--evidently not a descendant of the
"melancholy JAQUES," for he would have "rail'd on Lady Fortune in good
terms" had the game been at his expense.

Massa BLACKIE & SON send in a story by G. A. HENTY, always so
Hentytaining, entitled _When London Burned_. We all ken that when Rome
burned NERO fiddled, but this hero--not an 'ero--had every opportunity
of extinguishing--my Baronite means "distinguishing himself;" and our
cavalier availed himself, after many other wondrous episodes, to rush
with warm enthusiasm to throw cold water on this enlightenment of
London. Needless to remark, he came scatheless through the fire!

_From Snowdon to the Sea_, by MARIE TREVELYAN, shows us Wales in the
days of _Merlin_ and mythical superstitions, likewise of queer doings
on the part of bold, bad buccaneers, in whom we seem to trace something
of the origin of the modern Welsher.

A perfect black and white school romance is continued in _My Lost
Manuscript_, by MAGGIE SYMINGTON (WELLS, GARDNER AND DARTON).
Evidently this youthful writer had not read the wise counsels conveyed
in a manual _On the Art of Writing Fiction_ (brought out by same
publishers), or so much ink would not have been wasted. "After perusing
this cheery little book, the much encouraged aspirant," quoth our
Baronitess with a sigh, "for literary fame, will promptly lay down the
pen and write no more." Good news for the editors.

MISS BRADDON, in her delightful story _Christmas Hirelings_ (SIMPKINS,
MARSHALL & CO.), hits upon a novel suggestion for those folks who
don't know how to keep the festive season as it should be kept. Away
flies boredom! How? I will not reveal the secret, but if any nicely
suppressed little children possess an average Scrooge-like relative,
take my advice, and present him with this book. The result will be
more than even a child's dream can anticipate. Rather powder in
jam to boys will be _The Battle of Frogs and Mice_, by JANE BARLOW
(METHUEN), who is evidently a distant connection of the immortal _Mr.
Barlow_, with so much kind thought for youthful learning. It may be
Greek to many who have but a dim, far-off knowledge of the first great
burlesque writer: but this his book will bring it all Homer again to
us. Quite a relief to turn to our dear _Nonsense Songs and Stories_, by
EDWARD LEAR (FREDERICK WARNE & CO.) Vague yellow undulating pessimism
notwithstanding, how pleasant is real good nonsense! And even the
fairy story cannot be crushed by our juggernaut modern science, than
which the imaginative impossible, as in _Thought Fairies_, by HELEN
WATERS, and in the _Seven Imps_, by KATHLEEN WALLIS, is so much more
attractive to youthful brains. Both books issued by DIGBY, LONG, & CO.,
and wise of them to do so. MACMILLANS issue a splendid new edition of
the wonderful _Gulliver's Travels_, with over a hundred illustrations
by CHARLES E. BROCK, which ought to make the book go off like BROCK'S
fireworks. Its very warm cover suggests a seasonable book, _A Righte
Merrie Christmasse_, by JOHN ASHTON (_Leadenhall Press_), who, fancying
that some of its customs and privileges might be forgotten, collects
all that has been done or could be done at this annual event. Some
of ye anciente goinges on make one wonder whether feasts were better
kept when they spelt with such unreasonable euphony. It must have been
"merrie in halle" when the wassail song was ordinarily sung as depicted
by A. C. BEHREND in his exquisite copper etching.

_London Society_ is peculiarly bright and cheerful this Yuletide, and
keeps up its excellent reputation. A good medley is _London Society_.
And here is a very bright little _Woman_ this Christmastide. Quite a
festive party with her capital stories and supplement of "Types of the
World's Women." Just "Woman, lovely woman" in all styles and shades.
Without being more vain than any other average islander, one feels
grateful for belonging to the British group--no offence to the other
ladies, to whom we take off our hat, and, whilst including the rest,
salute advancing _Woman_. "And it is this New _Woman_, not _the_ New
Woman of the period, whom," quoth the Baron, "I salute with pleasure,"
and to whom he wishes a happy Christmas and a prosperous New Year, and
signs himself

READING BETWEEN THE LINES.

(_A Physician's Protest._)

MR. PUNCH,--As a specialist of some standing and experience, I wish,
Sir, to call attention, through the medium of your valuable paper, to
the injurious effects of a certain occupation upon the minds of the
individuals engaged therein, and their protection.

The occupation to which I refer is that of devising and arranging
what I understand are technically known as "headlines" for the
contents-bills of the more inexpensive London evening papers--an
occupation which I have no hesitation in characterising, on evidence
unconsciously supplied by the sufferers themselves, as highly dangerous
employment.

I am not sufficiently versed, Sir, to the _minutiae_ of newspaper
routine, to know what precise class of persons are entrusted with this
particular responsibility, though I have a strong suspicion that it may
be one of the many forms of degrading drudgery which the selfishness of
man has imposed upon the weaker sex. If so, of course it only increases
the necessity for interference.

And, whoever and whatever the persons performing such duties may be, it
is painfully obvious that they are labouring under conditions of mental
excitement, the strain of which no nervous system can support for any
length of time without inevitable and complete collapse.

Should there be any who consider this an overstatement on my part, I
merely ask them to give a glance at some of these same content-sheets
which are nightly displayed in our chief thoroughfares. Let them mark
the monstrous size of the lettering, the peculiar extravagance of the
epithets selected, the morbid insistence upon unpleasant details, and
then doubt, if they can, that the unhappy persons employed in such
an industry are affected thereby with some obscure form of hysteria.
Otherwise, let me ask you, Sir, is it likely, is it credible, that
seasoned journalists, tough men of the world, in touch with life
at innumerable points, could, in a normal state of health, be so
constantly "Startled," "Amazed," "Astounded," "Shocked," "Appalled,"
and "Revolted," as they admit themselves to be, almost every evening,
by reports and rumours which a little reflection would convince them
were utterly unfounded, or by events too ordinary and commonplace, one
might have supposed, to upset the mental equilibrium of a neurotic
rabbit?

Occasionally, too, there are symptoms of an excessive reverence for
rank, which, when found in the more democratic organs (where, indeed,
they are chiefly observable), denote a somewhat distempered state of
intellect, the delusion apparently being that the mere possession of
any sort of title renders its owner immaculate. Thus, they announce
with awestricken solemnity "A Peer's Peccadilloes," or "A Baronet Bilks
his Baker," giving these events a poster all to themselves, as others
would an earthquake, or some portent of direst significance.

Now this loss of the sense of proportion in human affairs, Sir, is a
very bad sign, and a well-nigh infallible indicator of nerve-strain and
general overpressure.

But I find a yet more unmistakable evidence in support of my contention
in the extraordinary emotional sensibility revealed by these headlines
whenever some unfortunate person has been sentenced to death for
the most commonplace murder. There is clearly a profound conviction
that the jury who heard the evidence, the judge who pronounced their
verdict of guilty, the only possible conclusion they could reasonable
come to, and the HOME SECRETARY who found himself unable to recommend
a reprieve, were, one and all, engaged in a cold-blooded conspiracy
against a perfectly innocent man. The convict has said to himself, and
that seems to be considered sufficient. And so, night after night, the
authors of these headlines harrow themselves by announcing such items
as "Blank protests his innocence to his Solicitor." "A petition in
Preparation." "Painful Interview." "Blank Hopeful." "Blank Depressed."
"Distressing Scene on the Scaffold." "Blank's Last Words."

Consider the strain of all these alterations of hope and despair,
repeated time after time, and almost invariably without even the
consolation of deferring the fate of their _protege_ by a single hour!
Is it not too much for the strongest constitution to endure? a service
which the society has no right to demand from any of its members?

Yes, Sir, whether these devoted servants of the public know it or not,
they are running a most frightful risk; the word which hangs above
their heads may fall at any moment.

Suppose, for example--and it is surely not wholly an imaginary danger
I foresee--suppose that some day some event should happen somewhere
of real and serious importance. Have they left themselves any epithet
in reserve capable of expressing their sensations at all adequately?
They have not; they have squandered participles and adjectives in such
reckless profusion that they will discover they are reduced to the
condition of inarticulate bankrupts; and, speaking as a medical man,
acute cerebral congestion would be the very least result that I should
anticipate.

Or the determining shock might come from more trivial causes. For
instance, we might lose a distinguished statesman, or an ironclad,
at the very moment when a football match was decided, or when the
professional tipster attached to their particular journal published his
"finals." Think of the mental conflict before determining the relative
importance of these events, and awarding one or the other its proper
prominence on the posters; and then ask yourself, Sir, whether it is an
ordeal that any human being of an impressionable, excitable temperament
should be required to undergo.

What precise remedy should be adopted I do not profess to point out.
Perhaps some one of the numerous leagues established to protect adult
citizens against themselves might take the matter up, and insist upon
these contents-bills being set up for the future in smaller type and
with epithets of a more temperate order. Perhaps Parliament or the
London County Council might be asked to interfere. All that is not
within my province, Sir, but this I do say: unless some measures are
taken _soon_, the heavy responsibility will be upon us of having
permitted a small but deserving class of our fellow-creatures to
hurry themselves into premature mental decay by the pernicious and
unwholesome nature of their employment.

  I am, Sir,
  Your obedient servant,

"OH, THE MISTLETOE BOUGH!"

(_A New Seasonable Song to an old Seasonable Tune._)

  The mistletoe hung on the brave old oak,
  The sickle went clinketing stroke upon stroke;
  The lads and the lasses were blithe and gay,
  And gambolled in Old Father Christmas's way.
  Old Christmas held high with a joyous pride
  The berried branch dear unto damsel and bride;
  For its silvery berries they seemed to be
  The stars of that goodly companie.
        Oh! the Mistletoe Bough!
          Oh! the Mistletoe Bough!!

  "Who wearies of kissing?" the Old Man cried.
  "Let her be a New Woman, but never a bride!
  Ha! ha! The old custom's approval I trace
  In red lip and blue eye upon every face.
  It was ever so, since time began.
  'Tis the way of the maid, 'tis the way of the man.
  'Tis also 'the way of a man with a maid,'
  For Cupid's barter's the oldest trade."
        Oh! the Mistletoe Bough!
          Oh! the Mistletoe Bough!

  "They are seeking to-day every new fangled way;
  Some tell us that wooing has had its day.
  In the highest, the lowest, the loneliest lot,
  The gleam of Love's berry makes one bright spot.
  And years may fly, as they will fly, fast,
  But one good old custom at least shall last;
  And when Christmas appears still the maids will cry:--
  'See! the Old Man bears the Love-berry on high!'"
        Oh! the Mistletoe Bough!
          Oh! the Mistletoe Bough!!

  "Gather!" he cried, and he waved his sickle.
  "Oh! fortune changes, and fashion's fickle;
  And youth grows mannish, and manhood old,
  And red lips wither, warm hearts grow cold:
  But whenever I come, midst the Yuletide snows,
  'Tis not Spring's lily, or Summer's rose
  Young men and maidens demand, I trow.
  But old Winter's white-berried Kissing-bough."
        Oh! the Mistletoe Bough!
          Oh! the Mistletoe Bough!!

  "For lilies wither, and roses pale,
  But the Kissing-bough keeps up the old, old tale.
  And dull were the world should the old tale cease!
  Be it kiss of passion, or kiss of peace,
  The meaning when lip unto lip is laid
  Is goodwill on earth to man, and maid.
  That's Yule's best lesson, good friends I vow,
  So reck ye the rede of the Mistletoe Bough!"
        Oh! the Mistletoe Bough!
          Oh! the Mistletoe Bough!!

  So they gather around him with laugh and joke,
  'Neath the spreading boughs of that brave old oak,
  Which hath shelter for all, from the English rose
  To the whitest snow-bell from Canada's snows,
  Or hot India's lotus-bud dainty and sweet.
  But the cry of them all, as in mirth they meet
  Old Father Christmas, as ever, so now,
  Is "Hands all round 'neath the Mistletoe Bough!"
        Oh! the Mistletoe Bough!!
          Our brave, bonny Mistletoe Bough!!!

CURIOUS ACCIDENT TO MRS. RAMSBOTHAM.

Strolling through Pimlico the other day Mrs. R. was attracted by
evidence of a sale by auction going forward in one of the residences in
that desirable quarter. Having half an hour to spare she thought she
would look in. "I was quite surprised," she writes to her son, "when I
entered the room to see a gentleman standing in a pulpit which I knew
was Mr. PIPCHOSE, leastway, his whiskers were not so mutton-choppy;
but I could not mistake him, though meeting him only once at tea at
Mrs. BROWN'S where he was very pressing with the muffins. He looked
at me in just the same meaning way as when he said, 'Mrs. RAM. won't
you take another piece of sugar, though as I know it's carrying coals
to Newcastle?' I'm not above recognising my friends, wherever I meet
them, and gave him a friendly nod, and before I knew where I was, I
found I had bought for L3 9_s._ 6_d._ a wool mattress; a pair of tongs
(rather bent); a barometer (with the quicksilver missing); a small iron
bedstead; a set of tea-things (mostly cracked); an armchair, and a sofa
warranted hair-stuffed, but certainly having only three legs. It wasn't
Mr. PIPCHOSE at all, as I might have known if I had taken another look
at his whiskers, but only a forward auctioneer."

TO MELENDA.

(_A Repentance in Triolets._)

  I swore to you, dear, there was mistletoe there,
    Though I knew all the time there was none.
  As I stole a sweet kiss from you out on the stair
    I swore to you, dear, there was mistletoe there.
  I have plenty of sins on my soul, dear, to bear,
    But at least I've confessed now to one.
  I swore to you, dear, there was mistletoe there
    Though I knew all the time there was none.

  I am sorry. I never will do it again,
    And please am I fully forgiven?
  In the future from falsehood I mean to refrain.
    I am sorry. I never will do it again,
  But look at yourself in your glass to explain
    Why to mistletoe tale I was driven.
  I am sorry. I never will do it again,
    And please am I fully forgiven?

  There's an answer you'll send if you're thoroughly kind,
    That will make me feel free from all blame.
  I hope you'll be glad, dear MELENDA, to find
    There's an answer you'll send if you're thoroughly kind.
  It's this, "Though the mistletoe was but a blind,
    Still with none I'd have done just the same."
  _There_'s the answer you'll send if you're thoroughly kind
    That will make me feel free from all blame.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS.

[Illustration]

Genoa in November. It is summer time. Put on thin suit, drink my _cafe
au lait_ by open window, and stroll out into beautiful Genoa, basking
in the sunshine. _Dejeuner_ in the garden of a restaurant, among the
old palaces. Sit in the shade, without my hat. Think of all the poor
people in London. Wonder if anyone is having a frugal lunch at the
funny little open-air restaurant in Hyde Park. Lemonade and a bath bun
in a fog. Should imagine not.

Charming place, Genoa. Hardly any Germans. Can at last hear people
talking Italian. In Venice there are so many Germans that one might as
well be in Germany. Sitting out on the Piazza, one hears incessantly
their monotonous, guttural chatter, always in the same tone of voice,
without inflections, without emotion, and, worst of all, without end.
Watched at the hotel _table d'hote_ a German lady sitting between two
German gentlemen. One man talked loudly without ceasing, mouth full
or mouth empty, from soup to dessert. The other man, rather older
and feebler, also talked without ceasing, but he could not equal the
other's noise; he only added to it. As for the lady, her lips moved all
the time; one could imagine the _ja wohl_, the _ach, so?_ the _ja, ja,
ja_, but one could not hear a word. At Florence, at Milan, on the Lakes
it is the same. If by chance one hears a Frenchman speak, his charming
language sounds more vivacious and melodious than ever before. So it
is good to be in Genoa, where even the best hotel is kept by Italians.
Apparently every other good hotel in Italy is kept by HERR SCHMIDT,
or HERR WEBER, or HERR SOMETHINGOROTHER, and all the servants are
German also. There is one hotel in Genoa kept by a German. It faces the
harbour. All night long there are whistles, screams, bangs, rumblings,
bumps, roars, and other sounds from trains, ships, and tramways. All
day long there is the same noise, only more of it. But the Germans
do not mind; they talk just the same, and they make each other hear
through it all.

Charming place, Genoa, with a town hall that is the gayest imaginable.
Marble staircases, vestibules adorned with palms, beautiful little
gardens, at all sorts of levels, outside the windows of the various
offices. Everywhere flowers. If the town rates in Genoa are paid at
the Town Hall, the paying of them must be almost pleasant. One would
go with that horrible demand note, if that is used also in Italy, and
fancy that one was arriving at a ball. The palm-decorated entrance
looks just like it. It only needs a lady rate collector, such as one
hears of in England, and one surely, in whatever manner the Italians
may say it, would beg the charming signora to give one the honour and
pleasure of a dance, and scribble her name on the programme--I mean the
demand note. And no doubt, the Italian officials being leisurely and
the space being ample, one could find time for a waltz in the intervals
of rate paying, or at least sit it out in one of the delightful little
gardens of this ideal Palazzo Municipale.

And so farewell to sunny Genoa, and off to Turin. German hotel again,
German proprietor, German servants. Solitary German visitor drinking
his morning coffee. The hotels of Turin are not crowded; he and I are
alone. What will the poor man do? He must talk his awful language
to someone. He shan't talk it to me, for I will pretend I do not
understand even one word. The waiter has left the room. Must the poor
man be silent? Thunderweather, ah no! Happilywise he is saved. The
considerate proprietor, thoughtful of his countryman's needs, enters;
he stands by the visitor's table, and the talk begins. When it ends I
cannot say, for I leave them, well started and in good voice, and hear,
as I think, their sweetly melodious phrases for the last time in Italy.
The train carries me away. There is not much more of Italy now, for
here is the Mont Cenis tunnel. Farewell, beautiful country, beautiful
pictures, beautiful language! There is someone leaning out of the next
carriage window. No doubt he is also saddened; he is speaking to others
inside, his voice is cheerful, he is evidently trying not to give way
to despair. Now I hear what he says, "_Da werde ich ein Glas Bier
trinken, ja, ja, ja!_"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
