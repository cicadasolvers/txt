FINANCIAL.


The receipts to December 31st, the first quarter of the fiscal year,
are $6,586.98 more than for the same period last year--an increase
in donations of $6,874.52, in income of $890.20, and in tuition of
$1,652.58--a decrease in estates for current work of $2,830.32 under
the policy of reserve legacy account.

We are greatly cheered by this increase in donations. We appreciate
the cordial response of the churches, Sunday-schools, Endeavor
Societies and individuals to the necessities of this great work. We
call especial attention to the efforts which are being made to
increase the gifts of this Association for the current year
thirty-three and one-third per cent. This is the amount of increase
which the Council Committee of Fifteen have asked from the churches.
The large work demands at least this per cent. of addition to the
gifts for the current year. Will not each individual church and
Sunday-school see that their contribution for this year is at least
a third larger than for the former year?

In addition to this amount needed for the work which has been
established in other years, the claims of Porto Rico are pressing.
Ten thousand dollars was a very conservative estimate of the amount
that was needed at once in this new island territory. The churches,
and especially the Sunday schools, have responded generously in
bringing up the gifts to about half this amount. There is imperative
need immediately for the full amount, properly and energetically to
press the work in Porto Rico along the lines of Christian education
and evangelization.

THE PROGRESSIVE SOUTH.


It is encouraging to note the signs of progress at the South towards
meeting the heavy responsibilities of the situation. It is a mistake
to imagine that the Southern situation does not improve from year to
year. Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, appreciate the trend
of events and the necessity for the elevation of the depressed
millions with whom they are intermingled. The Southern tragedies of
murder and violence have awakened the same horror in their hearts as
throughout the country at large. There is a rising sentiment against
lynching and for enforcing justice by the cold and passionless
execution of law. There is a strong desire to give the advantages of
education to both the ignorant whites and the ignorant blacks. There
is a growing sympathy for the beneficent efforts to this end which
are put forth from the North.

It is a great mistake to confuse the whole South with certain lower
elements in its vast and varied populations. It is also a mistake to
imagine that sporadic instances of violence here and there are
sufficient indices of the situation at large. Millions of the
Southern whites and blacks are dwelling together in amity and co
operation for the advance of education and for moral progress.
Illustrations are multiplying on every side of the desire on the
part of the progressive South to fulfil the duties and meet the
heavy responsibilities thrust upon it by the masses of population
submerged in ignorance.

These immense masses are the burden not only of the South, but of
the American people at large. Ignorant labor is shiftless and
wasteful labor. The growth of varied and inter-related manufactures
cannot rest upon a labor element of clumsiness and stupidity. Civil
duties demand intelligence and morals. The best patriotism of the
South joins hands with that of the North in the elevation of the
lowly and ignorant. What has been done is only the initiation of the
ten times more which must be done.

It is a significant fact that the last national census showed that
the white illiteracy of the South was deeper than even the foreign
illiteracy of the North; while that of the Southern black population
was fearfully darker. Both public and private efforts are being made
in countless communities of the South to begin the lifting of this
great burden. Some of the States have already taken encouraging
measures in this direction. While there are reactions, the general
tide is that of progress. It is easy to make too much of the violent
reactionary outcries of a few Southern newspapers. It must be
remembered that these shrill expostulations against progress are
comparatively isolated and do not represent the general and
deliberate sense of the intelligent South. The day has come when
intelligent leaders, North and South, can unite their efforts and
push forward the work of popular upliftment throughout the South.
The lesson of the hour is not that of impatience and denunciation,
but of mutual sympathy and co-operation. The hopeful progress of the
past is a presage to the magnificent progress assured to the
immediate future.

No more timely words have been spoken than those of a Southern
philanthropist when he said: "The Negro must be educated. It is
absolutely necessary to both races that his education go on. In our
extremity we look to wise and just people in the Northern States to
help us to help both races."

GREETINGS TO PORTO RICANS.


At a meeting of the representatives of the different benevolent
societies of our Protestant denominations who are entering upon
mission work in Porto Rico a committee was appointed to draw up
a paper containing a greeting to these people. The paper was to
be published in Spanish and English. The copies in English were
to go especially to the missionaries to be scattered among
English-speaking people. The Spanish translation was intended for
the native Porto Ricans. This paper was signed by representatives
of different denominations as will be seen. This broad,
comprehensive and loving message from the Christians of America to
the people of Porto Rico, who are now a part of our own country,
must meet the approval of all those interested in the progress of
the Kingdom of God rather than some narrow denominational victory.
This greeting to the Porto Ricans is as follows:

"We rejoice that your beautiful island has become part of the United
States. We take you by the hand as fellow-citizens of this Republic.
We pray that you may share fully with us in all the blessings it has
to give. We have come among you to show our interest in and our
sympathy with you, and to do what we can to help you and your
children toward the larger life that is possible to us all.

"We come to you as we have gone to all other parts of our beloved
land--as messengers of the gospel of Jesus Christ our Saviour. We
have come as brethren in Christ, as joint-members of that spiritual
body of which He is the head, to preach and teach among you, and
thus in mutual helpfulness to build up the Kingdom of our common
Lord and to answer His prayer 'that they all may be one,' and that
His will may 'be done in earth as it is in heaven.'

"We are agreed in the great truths of our holy religion, and we will
work together that they may produce in this historic island all the
choicest fruits of Christian life and culture. We would teach the
children the way of eternal life, and bring to the men and
women--full of cares and burdens--the rest and comfort and hope that
come through faith in the Saviour. And so shall they and we all be
brethren and sisters in Christ.

"These are the common purposes that bring us hither. In the name of
our common Master we pray you give us and our preachers welcome, and
join your labors with ours that this island, so charming in its
natural features, may more and more have the beauty of a pure and
purifying religion. Then happy will be your homes and happy your
people--as Holy Scriptures declare, 'Happy is that people whose God
is the Lord.' Education will brighten the lives of the children;
Christian morality will stand guard in every community against sin,
and the peace which Christ promised to His people will rest upon us
and ours.

"Praying for God's richest blessings upon you, beloved people of
Porto Rico, and asking your co-operation with us, we are

  Yours in Gospel of Jesus Christ,

  (Signed) C. L. THOMPSON,

  T. J. MORGAN,

  W. H. WARD."

PIONEERS IN PORTO RICO.

SECRETARY CHARLES. J. RYDER.


The opening of this new island territory for the Christian schools
and the evangelistic work of the American Missionary Association is
of great interest. Many questions are naturally asked by those who
are in sympathetic touch with this new and important movement.

_Who have gone to this field? Where have they gone and what fields
are opening? Why have they gone?_ These questions present themselves
to the attention of those who have watched with great interest the
opening of this island to an intelligent and progressive Christian
influence. Let us answer these questions in this article.

[Illustration: A SHACK--A PEASANT'S RESIDENCE.]

First, who have gone in this pioneer band of missionaries to Porto
Rico?

The educational work is especially under the care and direction of
Prof. Charles B. Scott and his wife. Prof Scott is a graduate of
Rutgers College and of Oswego State Normal School. He is a teacher
of many years' experience and thoroughly qualified for the
establishment and direction of the educational work of the
Association among this people. Mrs. Scott, a graduate of Michigan
University, also takes an active part in this work. They are both
devoted Christians, and the religious quickening and spiritual
elevation of the people comprise an important part of their
efforts.

[Illustration: MISS JULIA D. FERRIS.]

Miss Julia D. Ferris goes from Saginaw, Michigan. She received her
education at Wellesley College after leaving the High School of her
own city. She has been a teacher for several years and has attained
marked success in this work.

[Illustration: MISS ISABEL FRENCH.]

Miss Isabel French is a graduate of a classical school in New York
City and pursued a post-graduate course at Barnard College. She has
had large experience in teaching and in Christian and philanthropic
work, which qualifies her for this mission field.

[Illustration: MISS JENNIE L. BLOWERS.]

Miss Jennie L. Blowers has already had experience in the mission
schools of the American Missionary Association, having taught in
Chandler Normal School at Lexington, Ky. Her home is in Westfield,
New York. She was reappointed to work in the South, but was ready to
enter this more distant island field. She is well qualified for this
new work.

[Illustration: MISS KATHERINE M. ROWLEY.]

Miss Katherine M. Rowley comes from Oberlin, Ohio, being a member of
the First Congregational Church of that city. She is a graduate of
Oberlin College and is cordially recommended for this missionary
service by her professors and teachers.

Miss Mary L. Daniels is a member of Dr. Munger's church in New
Haven, Conn. She has been a teacher in the public schools, where she
has attained a high position as a very competent instructor. She
takes with her the regard and confidence of a large circle of
friends and there is every prospect of her abundant success.

[Illustration: MISS MARY L. DANIELS.]

All these teachers understand the Spanish language to some extent.
This is essential, in order to do the work in Porto Rico.

Rev. John Edwards, a pastor from Ohio, has been sent out by the
Association as an evangelist in this same field. The preaching of
the gospel is greatly needed, and Mr. Edwards' circuit covers a
large area in evangelistic services. He is in eastern Porto Rico,
where there is scarcely any other missionary work.

And so this little band of eight devoted men and women have entered
upon the pioneer work in opening up Porto Rico to an intelligent
gospel. They have gone out with the prayers and sympathy of
thousands of those who have been greatly interested in the important
work in this island territory. The future promises large things in
the building up of Christian character and the establishment of
progressive Christian institutions.

[Illustration: REV. JOHN EDWARDS,

_Evangelist_.]

_Where have these missionaries gone?_ They landed first at San Juan,
on the northeastern portion of the island. They established a school
at Santurce, which is a few miles distant from San Juan. From this
field Miss Blowers writes as follows:

[Illustration: AMERICAN MISSIONARY ASSOCIATION SCHOOL, SANTURCE.]

"The schoolhouse opens on the street (the military road), where
there is a constant stream of passers by. There is not an hour in
the day that there are not spectators peering in at doors and
windows with idle curiosity or eager interest. Sometimes there are
not more than three or four, but often as many as eighteen or
twenty. Let me tell you of the various persons who composed this
outside audience, as I watched them one morning. A native policeman,
a business man waiting for his car, three beggars, boys with large
trays of bread, fruit and sweetmeats on their heads, a washerwoman
with a huge basket of clothes poised securely on her head, the
driver of an ox-cart, who stopped his team while we sang "America,"
three women going to market, a party of daintily dressed,
sweet-faced senoritas with their chaperone, a dirty, wild-looking
old hag who almost frightened me, a young mother carrying a naked
baby in her arms, and boys--well, it was no use to count them. What
do you think? Are we not being well advertised?"

[Illustration: ON THE MILITARY ROAD FROM SAN JUAN TO LARES.]

Great care was taken in locating these schools. Rev. A. F. Beard,
Senior Secretary of the A. M. A., and Rev. William H. Ward, D.D., a
member of the Executive Committee, visited the island to examine the
conditions and discover the best points for such work. Prof. Scott,
after reaching the island, also made thorough investigation
concerning the most important location. He wrote after reaching
Porto Rico: "The railroad from Arecibo is impassable. I hired a pony
and a boy to guide me and started for the town. The only way of
traveling now, except on military roads, is by pony. I had never
ridden two miles on horseback in my life, but it had to be done and
I am still intact, and have ridden twenty to twenty-five miles
to-day without even getting stiff. We reached Arecibo, having to
ford or ferry streams five times. There were no bridges left.

"Friday I rode to Lares, eighteen miles over the roughest trail
imaginable. Much of it is as steep as a stairway, with stones of all
sizes replacing the steps. But I managed to stick to my pony. We
reached Lares at eight o'clock, the eighteen miles taking nine
hours, with three hours at noon waiting for the rain to cease."

Lares, a town of 3,000 population, is situated in the western part
of the island. It was finally decided that this should be the place
for the second school planted by the American Missionary
Association. Prof. Scott writes also: "Lares is a very pleasant
place, built around the top of a hill, the best residences at the
top, with best possible drainage and supplied with excellent spring
water. I had a letter to the Alcalde (Mayor) and to the leading
doctor of the town, a very intelligent man, who speaks English. I
examined several buildings and found one admirably adapted to our
purpose. It is central, with a large room on the ground floor and
five bedrooms, a dining room and kitchen for the teachers.
Everything is in excellent order. The sanitary condition, with some
changes, cannot be surpassed. The house seems just built for our
purpose, and with a minimum expense can be enlarged to give two
good-sized dormitories. All the people whom I saw were very much
interested in our work. The city can do nothing. They have paid no
salaries for months."

The schools at Lares and Santurce represent the present educational
work of the Association in Porto Rico. Both schools are well under
way and large numbers of eager pupils are in attendance. Prof. Scott
wrote so urgently for reinforcements in order to meet the needs
already pressing, that an additional missionary teacher was sent in
January. Miss Johanna Blinka was selected for this important
mission, as she was thoroughly acquainted with the Spanish language
and had had large experience in educational and missionary work.
This completes the force of eight teachers already engaged in the
educational work under the American Missionary Association in the
island of Porto Rico.

Rev. John Edwards has begun work in the eastern part of the island.
There are few missionaries here and the opportunities for
evangelistic work are pressing. The following interesting facts were
received under recent date from Mr. Edwards: He writes from Fajardo,
eastern Porto Rico, "There are many circumstances attending the work
here that are very trying and require the greatest of patience.
Still, on the whole, there is great encouragement. I have rented a
building here at Fajardo, to occupy as the centre of missionary work
in this region. I ordered a dozen benches with backs, to be used for
public service. A little table stands at the end of the room, on
which I place the Bible and use as a pulpit. It is my intention to
develop fully the promising conditions both here at Fajardo and also
at Humacao, where I have found a warm welcome.

"I understand the best time on Sunday for public worship is in the
evening. The young men are most of them occupied during the day.
Sunday is their busy market day until three or four o'clock in the
afternoon, when the market and stores close and all are free to go
whither they like. Some of the young men told me that a number would
attend our meetings in the night, that could not come during the
day. Of course, this is a condition unfavorable to such Christian
work, and yet I hope to be able to gather considerable audiences and
reach this needy people with the living gospel of Jesus Christ. I
speak in Spanish with comparative ease. We held services Sunday
morning, at which I preached. We then sang several hymns which the
people are rapidly learning. We need hymn books to offer them for
sale, that they may be used in our meetings."

[Illustration: A STREET IN SANTURCE--A SUBURB OF SAN JUAN.]

From this letter it will be seen that work is opening hopefully
before our evangelist. As the work develops it will demand a
reinforcement of preachers capable of doing the same sort of
earnest, evangelistic work. The demand in every department of this
new island territory is pressing and imperative. Surely the churches
of our Congregational fellowship will see to it, each one of them,
that the work is fully and cordially supported.

But a very natural question remains to be answered, namely, why have
these missionaries gone to this island field? The answer is easy and
natural. In the first place, Porto Rico is the only territory that
has come under the immediate direction and control of the United
States government as a result of the war with Spain. It is
emphatically a home missionary field. The responsibility of our
American churches is immediate and direct for the spread of the
gospel among the inhabitants of this island, who are even now our
fellow citizens. The American Missionary Association follows the
flag. By the adjustment of work suggested by the churches years
ago, at which the Association surrendered its foreign field and took
the work among the Indians as a legitimate department of its home
work, it has confined its missions to the territory of the United
States. Patriotism reinforces the demands of Christianity for the
physical, intellectual and religious development of the people in
Porto Rico. The time is immediate and the command imperative. It is
the command of our country as truly as of God.

Churches, expressing their views through resolutions of local
conferences and associations, urged upon the A. M. A. to occupy this
island field. This was another reason for going.

The appeal put before the churches in behalf of this important new
work met with immediate and hopeful response. Ten thousand dollars
are still demanded in order to put the work upon a proper and
permanent foundation. Buildings should be erected for the schools,
and this immediately. Also homes for the teachers, where model
housekeeping can reinforce the instruction of the schoolroom and
industrial class. Has not some friend, who reads these messages from
Porto Rico, the ability and desire to send a check to our treasury
at once, to put one of these mission schools in permanent quarters
and thus greatly reinforce the present work and secure its
permanency?

Little by little, as the evangelistic movements progress, chapels
will be needed for the accommodation of audiences that gather for
Christian worship. Here again is a large increase upon the demands
of Christian people for this new work of the American Missionary
Association.

Surely this little band of heroic Christian missionaries and
teachers who have gone out from their homes and from our shores,
responding at once to the call of the Master to enter this important
and large field, will not be forgotten by Christian men and women in
our churches. The work must not suffer. It should be reinforced
promptly and largely. In God's providence, mysterious and
incomprehensible, this island has become a part of our country. The
call now comes to occupy the field, not with armies and military
movements, but with the peaceful influences of Christianity. The
intellectual and moral quickening of the youth and children through
the Christian institutions planted among them, and the preaching of
the simple gospel of Jesus Christ to this destitute people, create a
responsibility which our Congregational churches must meet
courageously and generously.

There was romance in its birth. Regimental bands headed the
procession; army officers, men of renown, North and South, gathered
in the hospital barracks; thousands of ex-slaves, were there. One
passion animated this dusky throng. To learn to read was the
ambition of the bright colored boy, of his sedate but none the less
eager sire, and of the veteran grandparent with white hair and with
eyes that must learn the alphabet by the aid of spectacles.

[Illustration: JUBILEE HALL.

It was a moment of inspiration. The man to appreciate the hour and
give utterance to its meaning, was there. He had hardly surrendered
his commission as chaplain in the army. He had fought to win the
freedom of a race. To make that race true free men was a task much
more vast than to emancipate them. The parting of the ways had come.
An illiterate people must be taught. No longer should it be a crime
to instruct them. The rather was he the criminal who should deny
them an education. It was an hour for the voice of a prophet. With
the ken of a seer, Chaplain Cravath, representing the American
Missionary Association, Jan. 9th, 1866, made the proclamation, that
the founding of the school inaugurated that day was the beginning of
a great educational institution, that should give to the emancipated
race the opportunities and advantages of education which had so long
been furnished to the white race in their colleges and universities.

Gen. Fisk, the brilliant soldier and ardent philanthropist, lent
invaluable aid and consented to have the institution, so
problematical in its existence, bear his name. Governor Brownlow and
the pioneer educator of colored youth, Professor John Ogden, added
the weight of their words and helpful deeds, and Fisk had come into
being.

[Illustration: FISK'S FINISHED PRODUCT.]

ROMANCE ATTENDED THE EARLY LIFE OF THE UNIVERSITY.--Nearly four
years had passed, when the Professor of music started out with a
band of colored youth, who had been named the Jubilee Singers. That
they could sing with incomparable sweetness he knew. That the songs
they were to sing had incomparable pathos no one who heard them
doubted. But nothing short of sublimest faith could have sent forth
this band of friendless youth on their mission. They often were
penniless as they went from town to town. They arrived at Oberlin
and were permitted to sing before the National Council, then in
session at that stronghold of the colored man. The tide turned. It
rose with rapidity. Plymouth, Brooklyn, and other churches were
opened to them. The entire North gave them welcome. They crossed the
Atlantic; that gracious friend of humanity Queen Victoria, gave them
audience. Her incomparable prime minister, Gladstone, made them his
guests at Hawarden. Germany and France heard them. At the end of
seven years they returned to Nashville and laid at the feet of the
University the munificent sum of $150,000, a large part of which was
devoted to the erection of Jubilee Hall and the remainder to the
paying for the campus of thirty-five acres, once a slave plantation,
now the most commanding location in the Athens of the South, as
Nashville, the seat of four universities, is justly called.

THERE HAS BEEN ROMANCE IN ALL ITS LIFE. Never for a year has the
hard work, the distasteful drudgery, the, at the time, apparently
fruitless toil been undertaken on the basis of cold calculating
judgment; from its birth to the present hour, ideals that to most
men would have seemed dreams and wild fancies, have animated the
leaders of this enterprise--such ideals as have underlain the
world's greatest achievements and have given heart to the world's
victors.

WISDOM AND PAINSTAKING ATTENTION to the material interests of the
University, that have challenged the admiration of those who have
watched its growth, have been coupled with all this romance. The
ideal has been made actual. This has not been due to one man, nor
one sex, nor one race. For a quarter of a century and more, have men
and women, white and black, worked with an unanimity rarely equaled,
with patience and self-sacrifice. As the outcome there is

  FISK OF TO-DAY.

The building of Jubilee Hall set the pace for the progress of the
institution. Thorough workmanship, good taste and belief in a large
future, have prevented the erection of buildings which could be used
only a short time and must be replaced by structures adapted to the
work. Eight substantial buildings afford the facilities now needed
and are so grouped that in the near future the Central and Music
Halls can be erected, to complete the general plan. Already the
large enrolment of pupils, coming, as they do, from more than a
score of the states of our Union, is making the proposed buildings a
necessity and affording other givers the opportunity to bless
humanity that has been so handsomely met by those large-minded
donors who have built the structures already erected.

THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF THE UNIVERSITY is first of all religious. With
no cant, with the avoidance of undue emotion, with a constant appeal
to Christian manhood and womanhood, men and women loyal to Jesus,
seeking less their rights than to faithfully perform their duties,
are being reared. For nine months in a year the faculty of Fisk,
like those who in large cities man college settlements, day and
night seek in every way and by all means to arouse and perpetuate
the highest Christian ideals. Added to these are intellectual
training, musical culture and a spirit of true gentility. The
student body honors scholarship, awakens ambitions, cultivates good
manners, frowns upon untidyness of appearance, while by firmly
sustained legislation the faculty forbids any display of
extravagance in attire. Patches and darns are expected; soiled or
neglected garments the school will not permit. In a word, what one
would expect to find in a Caucasian institution, composed of pupils
of moderate means, with high ideals and gentle manners, are found at
Fisk. The choicest of the recently emancipated race are here seeking
a training. As always and everywhere, none reach the highest ideal.
Some are found who fail to aspire to it; a few are intractable, but
to one who recalls the life of the race and the treatment it has
received before and since it was freed, life at Fisk is a constant
miracle.

[Illustration: "AS GOOD AS NEW."]

THE FISK IDEA is an expression often on the lips of its alumni. It
may be summed up in this: The rudiments of learning for all, manual
training for those that are adapted to it and will use it in their
after life, the best of culture for those who are capable of
receiving and employing it. In a word, capacity not color,
Christianity not caste, is to decide the question as to the kind of
education a youth is to receive, whether he dwell in the North or
South, whether he be an Ethiopian or an Anglo-Saxon. Exceeding few
in comparison with the vast multitude of their race will be those
who receive their diploma at Fisk; but they are to be the leaders of
a people sorely needing leadership. And Fisk's determination to rear
such leaders is an abiding protest against the spirit which denies
to any human being a chance, and a declaration that the Church, like
its divine Master, is to minister especially to those who most need
help.

FISK PRODUCTS are the test of its work. Each year it publishes to
the world its list of graduates, and over against each name what he
is doing for the world. It does not hesitate to compare this list
with a like catalogue of any institution with equipment equal to its
own. It has faith to believe that the demon of prejudice will not
always hold its flaming sword to bar true manhood deserving success
at the threshold of life. It would do its part to overcome this
demon by producing self-respecting manhood, which in the eyes of
all true men commands respect.

FISK'S NEEDS are great. It needs such an endowment as shall enable
it to decline help from that truest foster mother--the A. M. A. Its
chairs professorial and for instructors should be placed upon a
permanent footing. In no other way can its fine plant be utilized.
If Northern institutions of learning must rely upon endowments to
pay from two-thirds to three-quarters of the cost of educating their
students, certainly an institution educating the youth of a race
scarcely forty years out of the house of bondage, and hence poor
beyond all expression, needs vastly more the income of an endowment
to supplement the meagre tuitions which its pupils pay. Here is an
opportunity for the man of large means to bestow a princely gift,
while the man of slender means none the less can invest in the same
undertaking.

The man or men who shall thus endow Fisk, will have ever the favor
of Him who has declared Himself the friend of the poor and needy.

[Illustration: DANIEL HAND MODEL SCHOOL.

Hand bequest.]

Fisk's greatest need is an answer to the prayer of God's people for
that constant indwelling of the divine Spirit which shall keep in
stout heart those who, with personal self-sacrifice, are doing its
work.

CHEYENNE AND ARAPAHOE INDIANS.

REV. W. M. WELLMAN, OKLAHOMA.


Christian work among the Cheyenne and Arapahoe Indians of Oklahoma
was first entered upon some ten years ago. It was begun by two
Christian Indians who labored with their own people until they were
discouraged and the work well-nigh died. Afterwards several young
men, one after another, came into the field, but though they were
individually earnest, their work did not make much impression. They
procured tables, chairs and reading matter and fitted up a room, but
nine out of ten of those to whom they were sent could neither read
nor write, and of course did not seem to be greatly drawn to current
literature. In 1893, however, Mr. and Mrs. G. W. Woodward took
charge, and did most excellent service, remaining almost a year
until they left to become missionaries in India.

[Illustration: (1) MISSION, DARLINGTON, OKLAHOMA.]

[Illustration: (2) MR. AND MRS. WELLMAN AND INDIAN WOMAN AND CHILD.]

Up to this time, for lack of funds and steady workers, the work had
been but poorly organized, and though the men who had been leading
were wise, earnest and true, yet as a force for permanent good, it
was somewhat in question.

In 1895 Rev. R. H. Harper, coming to take charge, found, he says,
one cheap two-room cottage, one pony, an old wagon and harness and
besides these a table and a few chairs. He knew that unless more
buildings could be procured, the work would amount to nothing. Upon
request, the Interior Department set aside two acres of land near
the government school for the use of the mission.

The Church-Building Society has at different times extended generous
help, as a result of which the mission finally secured a beautiful
chapel, with rooms and apartments above and below. Mr. Harper did
much excellent service throughout his stay, until 1897, when, his
wife's health giving way, he was compelled to leave the field.

[Illustration: ON THE ROAD.]

I succeeded him at once, and the work went forward, apparently
without abatement. I organized the work at the two government
schools carefully, and instituted evangelistic work in both. This
phase of the work was so successful that on the following Easter, 37
Indian young people gave their hearts to God and were baptized, and
on Children's Day, in June following, 29 others came in the same
way. A fervent religious interest prevailed in both of the
government schools, so that, at Christmas time, 35 others came into
the Church on an intelligent confession of faith. This most blessed
work could not be kept within the narrow bounds of the schoolroom.
It spread to the camp and field. The parents came to me to learn,
and I had many requests to go to them and tell them about Jesus,
till in at least two places, 18 and 20 miles distant from the
Agency, the camp Indians have asked to have a church organized and a
house built. On Easter Sunday, 1898, the climax was reached, so far
as numbers were concerned, when 67 young people, from ten to
twenty-six years of age, from both tribes, gave themselves to
Christ, and presented themselves for baptism. The interest is still
general though somewhat abated in intensity. Several times in the
last few months have smaller numbers united with the Church.

[Illustration: IN CAMP.]

A few weeks ago I returned to my work from the East, where dear
friends showed me every courtesy and sympathy possible, and while at
the Mohonk Conference of Indian Workers I met many whose hearts and
purses were open to pray for and help the helpless and abused red
man. During my visit East I found a general interest and sympathy
from churches and individuals, and money was put into my hands
sufficient to add two or three warm rooms to our parsonage, which we
have vacated and turned over to the sick and distressed Indians for
a hospital. With the rooms we have just added--work is now going
on--this parsonage hospital has one kitchen, one general work-room,
two rooms sufficient for four beds, a room for reading and study, a
laundry or general purpose room, and a bathroom; this latter,
however, we cannot finish at present for lack of money to provide
water facilities. Chairs and tables will be put in, and bead and
embroidery work, done in both silk and worsted, will be persistently
encouraged, so far as funds will allow.

There is attached to the mission a free medical dispensary, to
which a great many come. It is, however, only intended to be
supplemental to the general medical work under the direction of the
stationed Government physician, who is not only a thoroughly trained
and competent physician, but a careful and painstaking one as well.
A great many questions mingled with doubt are frequently asked us,
by those who look upon the Indian more as a curiosity than a human
being, or as a painted entity watching for an opportunity to wreak
vengeance on the white man. "Do you really think these young people
and camp Indians understand what they are doing," etc., etc.

[Illustration: IN WINTER QUARTERS.]

I say, "We certainly do, when a boy or girl, or a young man or
woman, no matter what color the skin may be, comes to us of his own
will, and says, 'I want to have a good heart and love Jesus and want
to be a Christian,' and then in the presence of both white and red
scoffers, is baptized and unites with the Church, and lives a
consistent and prayerful life, I have no reason or no right to
doubt." A few months ago there walked into the church, just as
service had begun one Sunday morning, eleven fine-looking Arapahoe
Indians. They were not richly attired, but they were clean. Only one
could even partially understand my words, but they were quiet and
attentive. After service they lingered. I said, addressing the
leader, "Coyote, what do you want?" "We Indians come 20 miles, want
to talk about Jesus. We hear you talk some days back, down on Big
River. You say, God love Indian just the same He love white man.
You say, Jesus came to help Indian be good just the same as white
man. Indian want good heart, to know how to love squaw and children.
Indian love Jesus and Indian give Jesus heart and brain and hand and
feet." "Well," I said, "let us pray and ask God." We knelt. I
prayed, Coyote prayed, and, with some hesitation, they all, in turn,
prayed fervently. I have no doubt they understood, although I have
not taken them into the Church yet.

A few weeks ago an old Indian woman with gray hair came into the
church. She could not talk much, but in their sign language I asked,
"Are you a Christian?" "Yes, yes," she replied; "I could not live if
Jesus leave me," and then making the sign as if washing on a
wash-board, and the sign for spirit (soul), pointing to my white
cuff--Jesus has washed my soul white--do they not understand? Can
we, dare we, turn one of these, His little ones, away?

SOUTHERN FIELD NOTES.

BY REV. GEORGE W. MOORE.


Quite a number of students and graduates of our A. M. A. schools are
in business and professional life in northern and western cities, as
well as in the South. A growing number of colored youth from the
North attend our Southern institutions. Thus Dr. Dubois, the noted
negro scholar and writer, came from Massachusetts to Tennessee to
take his college training at Fisk University. But it is of the
Southern field, as I have seen it during the last six weeks, that I
wish to speak.

Our Chandler Institute at Lexington, Ky., is filled with earnest
students, under the direction of Miss Fanny J. Webster and her
associates. Every year well-trained young people go out from this
school to their life-work. During a gospel meeting recently held
with the Lexington Church, more than fifty of the pupils of Chandler
School avowed their faith in Christ.

The church is built upon the site of an old slave-pen, the key of
which is preserved as a relic of those dark days. The neat chapel
now stands as a symbol of light and truth to the people. The pastor,
Rev. W. L. Johnson, is a graduate of Fisk, and his wife is from Le
Moyne Institute. She has taught in our service at Memphis and
Mobile.

Some of the most representative and influential citizens are members
of our Lexington Church, among whom are the two leading physicians,
the supervising principal and several teachers of the public
schools.

A directory of the negro in business reports: four physicians, two
dentists, two lawyers, an editor, two undertaking establishments,
several groceries, a drug store and other business enterprises,
besides mechanics, farmers, etc. They support a home for orphans,
and maintain a number of benevolent organizations.

The colored people of Lexington hold an Annual Fair at the State
Fair Grounds, which is a most attractive feature of Kentucky life.
During the week of the Fair the city is crowded, and the daily
attendance numbers thousands of the best people of both races. The
Negro Fair Association is entirely under the management of colored
men, and has a paid-up capital of several thousand dollars.

The thrift and intelligence of the colored people can be seen by the
large number of neat and well-appointed homes owned by them.

Plymouth Church, at Louisville, is making hopeful progress under the
ministry of Rev. E. G. Harris. Among the members of this church are
three teachers of the Colored High School, who are Fisk graduates.
The president of the Christian Endeavor is Dr. Whipple, a physician
of note, and the superintendent of the Sunday-school is Professor
Perry, the principal of a large public school of over a thousand
pupils. Some of the most active workers are mechanics and people in
humble life.

Rev. Gilbert Walton was present at one of our meetings and gave an
interesting address on the work among the people of the mountains of
Kentucky and Tennessee.

The colored people of Louisville are also making encouraging,
material progress. Dr. Whedbee and other colored physicians have
opened a medical school under the auspices of the Colored State
College. They have also opened a free sanitarium in the central part
of the city, which is supported by the colored people.

Our school at Florence, Ala., is crowded with boys and girls who are
eager for an education. Many of them walk in from the country a
distance of several miles. Among the pupils are two men who are
preachers. Miss M. L. Corpier and Miss Nicholson are in charge of
this school. They are both graduates of Fisk University. A revival
of great spiritual power was held in connection with the Florence
church and school. Four men of mature life and heads of families
were among the converts. The church is growing in numbers and
influence under the ministry of Rev. R. J. McCann, a graduate of
Talladega College.

We visited eight families of the church who lived in the country. In
one of these country homes we held a service in which four persons
were converted, whom we baptized. Two small children were also
baptized. There was joy in that home.

One of the most unique institutions of Birmingham, Ala., is the
Penny Savings Bank, under the management of colored men. This bank
has stood the storms of several panics and has been in successful
operation for more than a decade; it has the confidence of the
entire community. Mr. B. H. Hudson, the cashier, a graduate of
Talladega College, is a leading member of our Congregational Church.

Rev. Abraham Simmons is pastor of the church. At our closing service
at Birmingham, the three principals of the public schools, and a
number of teachers who graduated at A. M. A. schools, a graduate of
Fisk and now a theological student of Oberlin, several business men,
and men and women of humble life, all testified to their loyalty to
Christ and joy in His service.

A successful revival service was also held at Knoxville, Tenn., in
which more than thirty conversions were reported. I was greatly
cheered on Thanksgiving Day by the receipt of twenty-five messages
from these young disciples of their love to Christ and desire to
serve Him.

NEWS FROM ARCTIC ALASKA.

W. T. LOPP.


A letter just received from Mr. W. T. Lopp, who is missionary in
Arctic Alaska at Cape Prince of Wales, which was written under date
of October 2d, is of very great interest. It brings the latest
message from this distant mission-field, and this message is one of
great encouragement. Mr. Lopp writes:

"Now that the American Missionary Association is out of debt, we
hope you will be able to send us a missionary with a missionary wife
to be with us. It is hardly necessary for us to cite reasons for
this. He should be a minister, if possible. It would not be right to
subject children of school age to the influences of the life here.
You wrote us up last year as having 'no time for gold hunting, and
yet gold has been discovered within a few miles of the Cape.' This
brings upon us new anxiety and greater work. Should these claims
turn out well, the American Missionary Association will not be
forgotten.

"The _Bear_ has made a wonderful cruise this season. I doubt if she
ever made a longer one. She arrived here too late to look after some
whaling vessels, but considerable testimony has been secured, and if
the present captain commands the _Bear_ again next year I think
certain whalers will be seized if they do not change their ways. The
present captain has made a very conscientious commander, and has
surely exerted himself to perform his duty vigorously and honestly.
He has administered the law toward the Eskimo as well as white men,
and arrested those who were guilty of crime. He was very kind to the
natives, giving them help in coming from Cape Prince of Wales to
this point and also across the straits to Siberia. When the sea was
too rough for their skin boats he would have them hoisted up on
deck. The United States surgeon has also been exceedingly kind to
us.

"We now have 437 reindeer, and have sent an order signed by Dr.
Jackson to the station on Norton Sound for the 277 which are yet due
us. These will be driven up some time this winter. After they come
we will make an estimate of the number belonging to the Eskimo boys
and mark them. I have taken one new herder as an apprentice, and
hope to take another or two next year. We sold reindeer at thirty
dollars per head to the Bureau of Education, which furnished money
for training other apprentices. Our old apprentices can now pay
their own way, and the sale of the reindeer in the future will go
toward helping new apprentices till they can help themselves.

"The Woman's Home Missionary Association of Boston have contributed
toward the support of native workers. We received word about it and
rejoiced in their generous gifts. I will use it in helping support
Sokweena at our little mission at Mitle-tok. As I wrote last year,
we were enabled to start this mission through a small contribution
of about twenty-five dollars from the generous Endeavorers of
Westboro, Mass. Then some other friends sent in a little help that
went toward the support of Sokweena and his wife. It is not enough,
but we will try to make it do for the present. We were unable to
visit Sokweena but three times last winter. If we could only visit
him oftener and help him more he would be able to accomplish more.
But some of the children at his mission learn to spell and write a
little and to sing. We had some very good meetings. Lucy and I went
up and stayed three days. We took a lantern. Many of the old folks
had professed Christ and seemed to be earnest and sincere in their
prayers. The position for Sokweena is a hard one at times.

"Adlooat, one of our brightest boys, was typo and artist for the
_Eskimo Bulletin_. We will not be able to get the _Bulletin_ out
before November, I am afraid.

"We have just erected a building twelve by forty feet, which we have
decided to call 'Thornton House.' It is to be used as a workshop,
club-room and other purposes for the natives. The need of such a
building had occurred to Mr. Thornton and myself in 1890. Last year
Mrs. Thornton succeeded in gathering one hundred and twenty-seven
dollars, which was sufficient to purchase the lumber and pay the
freight on it. Two natives and I have put up the building. The
natives did most of the work on it, as I could not leave our house
long at a time."

CHRISTIAN ENDEAVORERS AMONG THE INDIANS.

F. B. RIGGS.


It will be ten years this February since the first Indian Christian
Endeavor Society was organized in Santee Normal Training School, at
Santee, Nebraska.

The Christian Endeavor movement was rapidly gaining everywhere, and
it was not long before other societies were started--in the Oahe
mission school, and the Presbyterian mission school at Sisseton,
South Dakota. Fourteen months later the first Indian Christian
Endeavor Society was started at Santee.

[Illustration: CHAPEL, SANTEE NORMAL SCHOOL, NEB.

[Illustration: MAMIE DAKA ELDER,

_Pres't Santee Endeavor Soc._]

This year at Santee the young people's society includes twenty-one
of the Indian pupils with three or four of the teachers, and there
are two junior societies, one of girls and one of boys. There is a
mothers' society, which was started three or four years ago among
the women of the mission church. All these societies have an
important place in the Indian mission work.

[Illustration: ETTA R. STAMFORD,

_Sec'y Santee Endeavor Soc._]

In the young people's society many of the members remain the
same from year to year; but during the ten years one hundred and
thirty-two young people have joined. They have come from eighteen
different agencies, and in several cases from more than one village
in the agency. Out of this one-hundred and thirty-two, twenty-three
have been engaged, since leaving school, in direct missionary work,
most of them as preachers and teachers of day-schools, but a few
as the wives of such teachers, or as teachers in mission
boarding-schools or missionary helpers. Some of these have done
excellent work, and those of whom this is true are nearly always
those who were most faithful and active during their school course
in the Christian Endeavor Society. Three or four of the most
promising have died before they had any opportunity to work at their
homes, but some of these short lives were so faithful and patient
that perhaps they did more good than many longer lives.

[Illustration: SANTEE JUNIOR ENDEAVOR SOCIETY.]

Three other societies have been started among the Indians, where the
leaders were chiefly from those who had been members at Santee. But
the societies not connected with mission schools have been
transient, or intermittent in their life. Those at Santee and
Sisseton, and one at Fort Berthold mission school in North Dakota,
have lived. A society is to be started at the Omaha Agency soon.

The young people's society at Santee has been a training school for
its members. It has broadened their feeling of Christian fellowship
with the great army of fellow Endeavorers. It has given them songs
that they enjoy very much. It has increased their interest in
missions and deepened their feeling of responsibility for service to
the Master.

The junior work at Santee has been especially encouraging among the
girls, who are rather more responsive than the boys. Of the twelve
little girls in the picture, one died last year, but eight are now
members of the senior society.

In the monthly meetings of the Mothers' Society of Christian
Endeavor many questions are asked and answered concerning the care
and training of children, and the children are remembered in prayer.

One thing, at least, these Christian Endeavor Societies have done.
They have emphasized the idea of _endeavor_ and _service_. It
expresses itself in the use of a new word, or rather the use of an
old word a thousand times where it was used once before. The name in
Dakota means "The society of those who want to work for Jesus," and
"working for Jesus" has become a more prominent thought in all their
religious life.

Last year a Junior Endeavor Society of Indian girls gave one dollar
to the Church-Building Society, one dollar to the Education Society,
one dollar to the Dakota Native Missionary Society, and one dollar
to the American Board. A Junior Endeavor Society of Indian boys gave
one dollar to the American Missionary Association. A Senior Endeavor
Society of Indian boys and girls last year gave fourteen dollars to
the American Board and three dollars to the Woman's Missionary
Union. The Endeavor Society proves, therefore, among the Indian
boys and girls and young people just what it does everywhere else.
It gives them larger views of the kingdom of God, it stimulates them
to greater sacrifice in giving of their means to the spread of this
kingdom, and awakens within them deeper spiritual earnestness. The
life of a Christian Endeavorer, wherever that life may be spent,
cannot be a narrow, selfish life, if loyal to the great Christian
Endeavor idea. This society is an important factor in Christian
enlargement and quickening among our young people on the prairie.

LINCOLN MEMORIAL SUNDAY.


Sunday, February 11th, marks this celebration in the calendars of
our Congregational Sunday-schools. A new Concert Exercise has been
prepared and will be sent to superintendents and teachers who desire
to keep this day in the interests of Christian patriotism and for
the support of the work among the needy millions represented in the
life and history of our martyred President, Abraham Lincoln. The A.
M. A. reaches by Christian education the American Highlanders, from
whom Abraham Lincoln came. It sends missionaries and teachers to the

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
