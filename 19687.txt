[Transcriber's note: I have made several changes from the original text
for this online text edition.  First, although I have not indicated
it here, in the original text the whole preface (with the exception
of the word dukkeripens) is italicized. Next, I have changed all the
sidebars to section headings. Next, the illustrations in the original
text consisted of rectangular graphs and numbers, and I have made
approximations of these diagrams with dashes and vertical bars.
The Master Column illustration (Fig. 13) originally had shading in
some of the rectangles, which I have indicated by X's.  Finally, in
the paragraph starting "Let it be minded..." I changed "Sex in Court
Cards" to "Six in Court Cards". All other spelling remains the same.]

Editorial Preface

"'Tis easy as lying."--_Hamlet_

It is safe to presume that even the most inquisitive book-hunters of
the present day, and few of the fellowship during two or three
generations past, have encountered the scarce and curious little
volume here presented, as in a friendly literary resurrection--
Robert Antrobus's "The Square of Sevens, and the Parallelogram."
Its mathematical title hardly hints at the amusement that the book
affords. With its solemn faith in the gravity of its mysteries, with
its uncertain spellings and capital-icings such as belong to even the
Eighteenth Century's early part, with its quaint phrases and sly
observations (all the time sticking strictly close to business), it has
a literary character, as well as me occult, that is quite its own.

Fortune-telling with cards and belief in fortune-telling with cards--
like a hundred greater and lesser follies of the mind--were straws
floating along the current of British life, intellectual and social,
during the reign of George the Second. This was the case, in spite
of the enlightening influences of religion, science, and philosophy.
Modish society was addicted to matters over which argument was
hardly worth while--in which respect we find modish society the
same in all epochs. Our ancestresses particularly were often
charming women, and almost as often sensible women; but, like
the men of Athens, they were too superstitious. Often were they
such in a fond and amusing degree. Lady Betty or Lady Selina--for
that matter, even Sir Tompkin and my lord Puce--might be spirited
men and women of the world. But they did not repudiate the idea
of ghosts. They abhorred a mirror's breakage. They disliked a
Friday's errand. They shuddered over a seven-times sneeze or at a
howling dog at midnight. And the gentle sex, especially, would
and did tell fortunes almost as jealously as play quadrille and
piquet. Let us be courteous to them. Let us remember that Esoteric
Buddhism, Faith Healing, and Psychic Phenomena were not yet
enjoying systematic cultivation and solemn propagandism; and
that relatively few dying folk were allowed to "go on with their
dying" as part of a process of healing which excludes medicine
and insists on the conviction that the invalids are not ill!

But to our "Square of Sevens"--with which even a Gallio may
deign to be diverted--especially if in using it the air is found to be
full of coincidences. The story of the book is already alluded to, as
odd. The inquisitive reader may be referred to "certain copies
only." Therein, "inserted by Afterthought on the Author's part"
(and therefore in a mere fraction of whatever represented the
extremely small edition of the work), may be sought the "Prefatory
Explication, made for the Benefit of My Friends, Male and
Female." In recounting the origin of the manual, its author is
candid, but at the same time too long-winded for quoting entire.
Enough to say, as the substitute for a lengthy tale of facts, that
prior to the year 1731 the author of "The Square of Sevens," Mr.
Robert Antrobus, "a Gentleman of Bath," was called in the month
of November to pass sundry months in Tretelly, that antique but
still lively little town of Cornwall. He describes himself
as "exceedingly vexed and inconvenienced by Summons on my
Affairs connected with the Parcelling of a piece of Property,
unexpectedly acquired." Mr. Antrobus--who, by-the-bye, may
perhaps be associated in the memories of readers of minor
Eighteenth-Century correspondence with such notables of the day
as William Pitt, Dr. Johnson, Admiral Byng, Mark Akenside,
William Pulteney, the Duke of Cumberland, and many others of
the time--was a shy, silent man of wealth. Also was he one of
considerable learning, out of the way and other, including an
interest in gypsies and gypsy language remarkable for the period.

He lodged at "the only Inn of any suitability" in the place. Thereby
be made an unexpected acquaintance. Before a week had elapsed,
he became much interested in the fact that under the same roof,
but in more bumble quarters than his own, was lying and dying
another stranger in the place. This was a man of some forty years,
known only as "Mr. George." His home is not a clear matter, nor
that he had any relatives except a little girl of six or seven years
old, his child. It is likely that in alluding to him in the "Prefatory
Explication" mentioned, Mr. Antrobus disguised what was already
obscure, and that "Mr. George" of the "troublesome Talk of the
Inn-people" is an abbreviated pseudonyme.

Mr. Antrobus was a humane and benevolent man, as well as an
inquisitive one. He delicately assisted to make the sick guest
more comfortable in his wasting body. He won his confidence,
genuinely compassionated his anxieties, and presently pledged
himself to a most kindly office--the care and provision in future
for the child soon to be fatherless; long before this time
motherless. Whether she was motherless by the actual death of the
parent, or not, Mr. Antrobus did not learn, or does not tell. But he
did learn, by a confession, that "Mr. George" was really George
X--, a gypsy, and one withal of unusual education and breeding.
More remarkable still, he was a gypsy intensely embittered
against' a race from which he had lived for many years wholly
withdrawn. The cause of such sentiments and renegade existence
good Mr. Antrobus "tryed in vain, with much Delicacy" to
discover. At the clearest, it appeared to him to date from the dying
man's marriage and from some stormy period of his career. In any
case, the renunciation of "Mr. George" in lot and part in gypsydom
was of savage sincerity. He would not tolerate the idea of his child
being left open to such influences; and, as a matter of her happy
fortune in meeting with our kind Bath antiquarian, she never
encountered them.

Recognising in his benefactor not only a generous man, but one
genuinely interested in the whole topic of gypsy life, character,
and affairs (moderately studied at the time preceding a Borrow or
a Leland), "George X--" entertained Mr. Antrobus "for hours and
dayes" in what must have been an extraordinarily free parliament.
It discussed not merely the concerns in general, but the secrets, of
Egypt. "Mr. George" bad travelled much. He bad acquired a deal
of special knowledge delightful to Antrobus. It is provoking that
Antrobus did not commit more of it to paper. But, among other
matters, Mr. Antrobus was enlightened on the secrets of  looking
into _dukkeripens_ in a degree of minuteness that few gorgios
enjoy.

As part of this last confidence--the rarest from one of the Blood--
did George X-- disclose in course of certain seances the "Square of
Sevens," that most particular and potent method of prying into the
past and present and future. In it figures the wonderful
"Parallelogram," with its "Master Cards," "Influences," and so on--
which our book records. Moreover, George X-- declared that
whereas most of his race can or will use only corrupted or quite
frivolous versions of it, this statement set its real and rare self
forth with the utmost purity, value, and completeness, in a degree
"known to only a few of all the families of Egypt." As such a
weighty bit of Black Art did Mr. Antrobus make its details into a
book. As such he printed it. Doubtless he thought that a betrayed
secret may lawfully be re-betrayed as fully as possible.

Nevertheless, it was not so much of a re-betrayal. For less than
what a publisher of this day would call one fair-sized edition of
"The Square of Sevens," printed for Antrobus by the great John
Gowne, of The Mask book-shop, has ever appeared. And, to
account for the semi-privacy surrounding the little work, must be
set forth the dolesome incident of a printing-house fire burning,
"all except about a dozen or so of copies," before there had been
any "distribution of the Book" among the author's "Friends, Male
or, Female, or to the Publick." By some sudden change of his own
mind or his conscience, Mr. Antrobus did not order any new
edition. The prefatory "Afterthought" mentioned may be found,
only if stuck in some of the copies of the volume--doubtless by
quick and clumsy after-pastings.

Why Antrobus did not give the volume real currency is not known.
That he was urged to do so is certain. It is likely, however, that
about this same time some pecuniary losses withheld him from
such expensive bobbies as printing books. He returned to Bath,
and died there in 1740. We have no particulars of the event, nor
are there more than allusions to it in the journal of the date or in
the letters of contemporaries. Lady Lavinia Pitt, however,
mentions the disease as the smallpox, then so much dreaded.

He left no family--except his young ward, the mysterious daughter
of "Mr. George"--of the Tretelly Inn. To her Antrobus had given
his name, and she inherited half his estate. Shortly after her kind
guardian's death she married an Exeter gentleman of high family.
Her father, "Mr. George," died in the course of Mr. Antrobus's
stay at Tretelly.

To some beaux and belles of the reigns of George II. and George
III. this book, originating in the conversation of another George--
George the Unknown--could well seem an interesting matter. All
the more might it be so in view of its scarceness, from the first.
There are no more copies of it, despite the fact that fashionable
dilettanti in things occult have borne it in mind. Could anything be
more characteristic of Horace Walpole than to find him in a letter,
from serene Strawberry Hill, confessing--to no purpose--that he is
"desirous of getting hold of that damned queer old woman's
fortune-telling book, by Bob Antrobus." In the Diary of the
sprightly Louisa Josepha Adelaide, Countess of Bute (afterward so
unfortunate a wife and an even more unfortunate mother), she
describes a droll scene at a Scotch castle one evening, in which the
unexpected statements of  "The Square of Sevens" as to the lives
and characters of the company "put to the blush several persons of
distinction" who rashly tempted its wisdom--especially including
the aged Earl of Lothian. For what Lady Morgan thought of it, and
the characteristic story of the peculiar terms on which she offered
"to sell her copy to Archbishop Dacre," the reader is referred to the
Bentijack Correspondence.

It is on its face a model method of fortune-telling with cards;
easily the first for completeness and directness. Our author, in a
letter to his cousin, Henry Antrobus, quotes the eminent Brough as
styling it not only the most authoritative little book on its topic,
certainly the most interesting one; hit the only volume on the
subject "which is not a confusing and puerile farrago of nonsense--
troublesome to look into and unsatisfactory to acquire."
Certainly our ancient enthusiasts record can be learned and used
systematically, exactly as is the case with such excellent and
approved systems of chiromancy as Mr. Heron-Allen's and others.
It may be thought fortunate for modern students of card-divination
that the work has survived, so complete and clear. Its discreetness,
too, is delightfully adroit, when it suggests that its tenses, past,
present, and future, are not as definite as one might desire.

There is no copy of the hook in the British Museum, nor in the
Paris Bibliotheque Nationale, nor in any public collection of
America, England, or France that I can name. One worn but
perfect MS copy is to be found in a private library in the United
States. Another might yet be sought in far Australia, if still owned
by descendants of Mr. Antrobus's young ward. Only by a special
personal interest in the matter, and with a sense of risk to an
heirloom, I am permitted to make the manuscript for this edition.

Undoubtedly, as "R.A.," Mr. Antrobus dressed the mystic
"Significances" of the cards in the book's "Tavola" in English less
blunt and uncultivated than they came to his ears from the lips of
the dying "George--." But that he took no other liberties of
the least consequence is pretty certain. He respected the
"Supernaturall" here, as in his grave brochure on the Cock Lane
Ghost, which spectre, alas! mightily took him in. And, by the way,
the reader will please observe in his pages here following that
though the method of "building" and so of forming the "Square,"
and of "reducing" it, seems at first glance bothersome and
complicated, it is only a childishly easy performance in the way of
making a square of seven rows of seven cards, and then of making
the rows only three cards deep, at most! Crazy superstition and the
aim at mummery have added the details of process that seem
tedious. And, really, they are not ineffective in a drawing-room.

What we read of thus as carefully put together, conscientiously
printed as a thing to be taken with seriousness, in its author's time,
may in our social day serve a lighter end--and entertain the parlor,
rather than awe the boudoir. With this intent, as well as in offering
something of a literary curio, the present Editor assists it toward
the glimpses of--not the moon, but the electric chandelier. And its
Nineteenth-Century sponsor hopes that many curious and pleasant
"fortunes" may be read by it; and that in its pages the ominous
Spade, the mischief-working "Influencing-Card," the stern
"Master-Card," the evil "Female or Male Enemy," and the "Vain
and Amoratious Man" (who must be ever, indeed, a terrible
combination to endure) may not be frequently encountered--in any
case, that along with many other troubles and trials, such
unpleasing meetings may not come outside the vagaries of a pack
of cards.

THE SQUARE OF SEVENS



_Of the Preparing of the "Square of Sevens" from which is made
the Parallelogram; with the due Shuffles, Deals, and Disposals
thereto_.


Take a Pack of Fifty-Two Cards, Shuffle the same well, Seven
times. Then present the Pack to the Person whose Queries you
seek to answer, who accordingly shall be called your _Querist_.
Therewith must your _Querist_ chuse from the Pack, without
seeing the cards in it--three several Cards, which are to be called
his _Wish-Cards_; the same being chosen with a Cut between each
Choice. The _Querist_ must not seek to see these same Wish-Cards;
they are to be laid apart on the Table, or left to Repose in
the _Querist's_ care, till all that followeth of the _Square_, the
_Parallelogram_, and the _Reading_ be ended.

Of the Dealing of a _First Seven_ Cards.

Again take in hand your Pack and Shuffle it yet smartly, there
being Forty-nine Cards now left in it. Proceed next earnestly to
Deal them forth on the table in the following Order and Manner,
and without first seeing their Faces. And be solicitous of laying
them down just as they shall come, Faces upward, in a Downward
and Oblique Line; taking them from the Topmost of the Pack until
you have laid forth Seven, Cards. And while you cruise and lay
down the same, and indeed during all that here ensueth of
Directions for your following, avoid foolish Conversation and
sottish Pleasantries with those about you;

Observe that each side of your Figure thereby has Four Cards, and
its midmost Rows, horizontal and perpendicular contain, like the
first Row laid, Seven cards apiece; and offer thereby a Fair
_Cross_, the Goodliest Sign.

The first Figure needed, the _Square_, is now nearing Shape; its
Rows, diagonal or horizontal or perpendicular, equalizing. Shuffle,
and deal from the Bottom of the Pack, a Rightward Border of
_Three_ Cards, upward laid. (Fig. 8.) You have now four rows of
sevens, in your figure: a _Cross_, withal still to be found in its
middle--reckoned up and down and right and left.

You must now Shuffle--so well as your lessened cards will allow,
yet with but one Shuffle--and deal, from your Pack's Top, a
downward Left-Hand Border of _Three_ Cards. (Fig.9.) Note that
you now have in your Figure _three Rows of Sevens_; which you
may well

    FIG. 12

For now have you before you the very _Square of Sevens_: being
a magicall Square Figure of Forty-nine Cards, whose Rows
include ever _Seven_ Cards, taken anyways. And that same
mysticall Square now must be made ready for use in Reading your
Querist's Fortune (or Experiences) by making it into a
Parallelogram of smaller compass, through what is called its
formal _Reduction_.



_Of the Square Formally Reduced to The Parallelogram; and of
The Master-Cards & The Sacrifice_.

Having thus built your Square, chuse the extreme right-hand card
in its Uppermost Row. Lay it on such card of the same Suit as lieth
nearest it, in the same Row, if there be such; save on the last Card
on the Left of the Row.

Of the _Master-Card _and_ Master-Column_.

This Leftward Card in each Row is called the Row's _Master-Card_,
and it cannot be covered by any other card, nor be moved.
It must open and alone abide as it is; and the Seven Master-Cards,
counted downward on the Square's left Edge, make what is called
the _Master-Column_.

If you have no other card of the same Suit as your right-ward card
--or none save those of the _Master-Column_--let it lie. But if you
can lay it on another, not a _Master-Card_, of any degree in the
Suit--for observe the degree here matters not--so do. And then
mark if, leftward and toward the _Master-Card_ of the Row, lies
another of the same Suit. If so, take up the two cards you laid
together; and lay them on this third one. Look again and carefully;
and, if another of the Suit be found, carry to it the former ones. So
do until you have no more of its Suit toward its left, to join unto,
and until all the cards of one Suit in the Row lie piled together;
save the _Master-Card_, which even if it be of the Suit lieth alone,
leftward, as it was first dealt out and down, in the last Square.

Of the _Reduction_.

Proceed then with the next Suit in the Row: and so with each Row,
until you have thus sorted all the cards save the Master-Cards.
This is the _Reduction_.

Close now and straiten-up together each of the Rows thus broken
into Piles; pushing ever toward the _Master-Row_. Thus have you
a new Figure, smaller than the last Square of Sevens, and
somewhat irregular: there be in some Rows five cards, in others
less; even so few, though rarely, as three or two. Note that a Pile
of Cards is reckoned only as one card. Note, too, that with cards
that have become hid beneath others you have no concern.

Of the _Sacrifice_.

Next, cast or lay aside in a parcel, all Cards in the Figure that are
not contained in the three Columns, leftward (the _Master-Column_,
and two other Columns). If, your _Reduction_ done, any Row offer
to sight but two Cards--the _Master-Card_ and its neighbor--so
must the Row abide. But this comes rarely. You will best not
disturb the Cards hid in the Piles, for it is well to let
Sleeping Dogs lie, and moreover needless Fingering and Quiddling
of the Parallelogram is not commended. With the cards thus
rejected have you no more to do. They are called the _Sacrifice_.

The _Parallelogram_ made.

Now have you a _Parallelogram_ of One-and-Twenty Cards in
sight (Fig. 13), reduced from the Square that formerly held
Nine-and-Forty. With these One-and-Twenty now under your eyes
I will be your Querist's affair.

You may indeed ask why so much Labour is made of building the Square
only to reduce it, to despoil it, and to force it to hide or to
part with so many of its Sevens--as by a sudden Slaughter or a
Panic or a Plague. But it is held that by such prior Shufflings,
Dealings, and Placings are much cherished the accidentall
Declarings of Fates intelligence; and that by the other Processes,
embracing The _Sacrifice_, there remain for _Reading_ just the
Cards decreed; free from disposition by light-fingered Craft, or
from ticklish Arrangements by Skill.

A Thing of Great Mystery and Fair Harmony--as Jacobus of
Utrecht calleth the _Soul_.

And the Square itself, the Parent of the Parallelogram, is of great
Harmony as a Mystery. Indeed all other Methods of reading
fortune in Cards are incomparable to it.

_Of Summarizing in the Parallelogram its Aspect and of the
Fortune or Experience of the Querist that it will Report_.

With your Parallelogram thus built, observe it as an Whole; and
remark if it hath an Agreeable or Unpleasing _Aspect_--one
Auspicious or Unkind, according as it contains rather the red or
the black Suits. For a Red Aspect is kindly. A Black Aspect
contains many less favorable cards, especially if they be _Spades_.

Of _Hearts_ as a Portent.

And, for another Matter, and a wider Notice as to the Suits of
Cards:--it has long been assured by those best knowing Card
Intelligences that the Suit of _Hearts_ is the Suit of the Affections,
Passions, Fancies and Feelings.

Of _Diamonds_.

And the Suit of _Diamonds_ ever refers to Condition in Life,
Society, Wealth, Position and the Fine Arts; and contains many
Comfortable Cards.

Of _Clubs_.

In the _Clubs_ lies the Judgment, the Intellect, the Will, and the
Affairs of a Man's Brains, and what he doeth of his own Mastery
and Genius.

Of the ominous _Spades_ suit.

The _Spades_ is ever the suit of doubtful or worse Prognosticks;
of the Events that arbitrarily fall to Man's Lot, those things which
hardly can any Prescience or Plans or Conditions of our own
making amend. Thence is it that in especiall comes a serious, nay
even a gloomy appearance to the _Parallelogram_. Your first
Glance at it, therefore, gives you a Generall Character in it, to
state first to the Querist before its details.

Of a particular _Uncertainty_ in a Prognostick.

But particularly note that Matters to be read in its Cards may often
refer not to the Future, or to the Present, but to the Past. Especially
is this the truth with the Old or Elderly or with those Wed. Such
must expect to be told of Experiences that lie behind them, rather
than before them, of Good or Evil; for Fate oft allows sparingly of
Incident to those of middle years, or later; and therewith she is
often pleased to make her Oracle speak coldly to a Querist, of
Ancient Circumstances.

The Shot seldom goeth twice into the same hole; and a Dead
Trouble or Joy rarely Reviveth.  And a Blessed Thing that 'tis so!

Hence, whether a Significancy in a Card speak of what is come or
is yet to come, at best is none too certain; only it is true that the
greater or harder Experiences of Mortall Lives seldom be
duplicated. With the Young or Unwedded, the Significancies are
of the Future, with far more determination.



_Of the Reading of the Parallelogram, according to the Tavola;
and of the Wish-Cards_.

Note now your Card in the Right-Hand column, and also the Card
next it, of course to the Leftward; which Leftward Card is spoken
of as _Influencing _the other.

Of the Influences, In which the Philosophick will find a likeness to
Human Circumstances.

The Significancy of it, for good or evil, is given in the _Tavola_
that follows in this Book, by its proper Suit and Degree: and this
you will tell to your Querist. Next note the card, which was just
now an Influencing Card, but which, now in its turn, is to be
considered according to the _Influence_ cast _on_ it by the
Master-Card, beyond it, leftward. Declare this Significancy. Last,
declare what may be the Significancy of the Master-Card, as such
and alone. And so proceed, as to each card in the _Parallelogram_,
ever naming _last_ the Significance of the Master-Card, until your
_Parallelogram_ is all interpreted to the Querist. And note that the
Master-Card even as an _Influence_ is not more potent than
another, (as far as is known), and that its Dignity and Potency arise
only in its being uninfluenced; and, so speaking, from its
Significance with a certain Individuality not belonging to its
two Fellows. Nor are there; any Influences cast _Upward_ or
_Downward_ by the Cards, out of the Row in which each lieth.

Having read the Parallelogram from beginning to end, slowly and
honestly, lay forth those three _Wish Cards_, early chosen by your
Querist, but not dealt in the Square.

Of the _Querist's Wish_.

If they contain more _Red_ than _Black_ Cards, this shall come:
the Querist may wish a _Wish_ for his own Profit or Pleasure,
even in removal of an Evil that hath been read to him in the
_Parallelogram_. If there be Black rather than Red cards in the
Three, he must wish a like wish for _Another_. And in either case,
if the cards deciding his Privilege be of high degree, such as
_Court Cards_, Aces or above the Eight, his Wish is likely to be
granted, or at least it is not in vain in some sort. But if the Cards
be low in Values he has desired to Fruitlessness.

Let it be minded that by the Phrase an _high_ or a _low_ Card in a
Suit is ever meant, respectively, the cards above or below the
_Eight_; the Aces being reckoned as the highest in a Suit. And
indeed Cards must ever be read with a Considering of their
Degree, and of the Six in Court Cards. Where there be no speciall
Significancies given to the Degrees, the Judgement must I shift as
best it can.

It is well not to oblige, of any one evening, or on a set and single
occasion, more than a Querist or so--maybe, oblige at most three
Querists--by making Squares of Sevens and Reducing the same and
Reading what may lie therein. Too much of any good thing makes it
over-common, blunts the Appetite and dulls the Apprehensiveness
of the Reader. With fatigue, too, may come Carelessness and,
on good occasion, even Lying: and, besides, let us respect the
Supernaturall.



THE _TAVOLA_ OF SIGNIFICANICIES AND INFLUENCES, PROPER TO THE
TRUE _READING_ OF THE PARALLELOGRAM; ADJUSTED IN A SYSTEM OF
ALTERNATIVES


NOTE

In transcribing this "Tavola," the Editor has somewhat modernized
the spelling and capitalizing, for the convenience of the reader.
With reluctance, but of necessity, he has also amended--or
emended--the phrasing, where it is in the original hardly consonant
with modern taste.


OF HEARTS

_The Ace_.

As a _Master-Card_, a special Emotional Experience. Influenced
by a _King_ of like Suit, there is figured an Intimate Friend, or
one in whom the Querist is much bound. By a _Queen_ of like
Suit--an Emotion for a Woman of beauty and charm. By a Knave
of like Suit, an Attachment to a Man younger than the Querist.
Influenced by any _high heart_ other than those above, an
Amorous or Affectionate Temper of mind or body. By a _low
heart_, an impressionable, kindly Nature. These are Five Special
Interpretings. The more general are: influenced by a Diamond,
Good Fortune in something, measured by the degree of the
Influencing Card. By a Club, a Talent or Gift to be made much of.
By a Spade, an Error, or Disappointment, in the degree of the
influencing card.

_The King_.

As Master-Card, is figured that the Querist deals or has had much
to do with a Man of fair skin and light type, of good temperament.
Influenced by an Ace of like suit, one notably unselfish. By
Knave, a Lover, Husband, Friend. By a Queen, a Love-match. By
a Diamond, a Man of Wealth or artistic nature. By a high club, a
Man of Energy withal; by a low club, one of Prudence. By a
Spade, a man of some defect of Temperament, or of a Chronic
Malady or Blemish, ominous to him and others.

_The Queen_.

As Master-Card, is referred to specially, an amiable, affectionate
Woman, rather one sentimental than of intellect. Influenced by
like suit, if an Ace, she is admired of Many; if a King, she is
wedded, betrothed, or beloved by one in especial. By a Knave of
like suit, she is beloved by a Male Relative in especial, not of her
own near family. By other cards of like suit, degrees of regard. By
a Diamond, a Woman gifted, and esteemed much in Modish Life.
By a Club, though not learned she appreciates knowledge in
others. By a spade, she is not of firm health; or not of wholly firm
Virtue.

_The Knave_.

As Master-Card--the Querist's closest Friend; yet likely held such
because of feeling rather than judgment. Influenced by an Ace of
like suit, there is no Inequality in the affection. By a King of
like suit, Resemblance to the Querist in physique or mind or
disposition. By a Queen of like suit, one with distinctively
feminine traits. By another card of like suit, a popular man with
his fellows. By a diamond, of wealth or social Position; but if by a
Nine of Diamonds, not enduring in such Happy Fortune. By a
Club, a Friend of judgment and good at advice. By a Spade, a
Friend of not too sound health: or apt of offence.

_Ten_.

As Master-Card, a general reference to Matrimony, as being ever
the card-matrimonial. Influenced by like suit, a High-Marriage and
that auspicious: by a low heart, a Marriage not one's first or
first-wished. By a Diamond, a Marriage with money in it. By a
Club, a Marriage of reason or of circumstances. By a Spade, an
Interrupted or more or less Disastrous Match.

_Nine_.

As Master-Card: a Card of Good Augury for what we wish for
Another. Influenced by its like suit, an unexpected Meeting, with a
person much affected or desired. By a Diamond, a Pleasure in
store. By a Club, a Wish partly fulfilled, rather than wholly. By a
Spade, a Wish fulfilled but followed by some detrimental Event.

_Eight_.

As Master-Card, a Love-Interest. As influenced by like suit,
an Interest of much Romance. By a Diamond, a Lost Article
recovered. By a Club, the Victory in a difference or argument as to
some plan or act. By a Spade, a Caprice to warm the heart; or a
new Article of dress or household stuff.

_Seven_.

As Master-Card: the Card of Trust and Confidence approved of.
Influenced by like suit, honest Love, or Family regard. By a
Diamond, wise Trust in a commercial or social step. By a Club, in
a Secret. By a Confidence misplaced in a person or event.

_Six_.

As Master-Card: A strong Inclination, a Desire, or Action is well
rewarded. Influenced by like suit, it concerns another even more
than ourselves, or as much. By a Diamond, a step of social or
artistic or pecuniary vantage; save if the diamond be the nine,
which leaves the result in Doubt of full success. By a Club, a
Matter of Judgment and practical bearing, seen and discussed of
others; or a Remark, or a Letter of more consequence than would
appear. By a Spade, an Inclination or desire, not wholly honorable:
or of brief realization.

_Five_.

As Master-Card, an amusing and diverting Affair heard of, or
entered into. Influenced by its like suit, a Feeling not hitherto
returned is met at last. By a Diamond, a Success in some-thing
particularly wished. By a Club, a keen and shrewd Chance at a
remark to be well caught. By a Spade, an Ache, Pain, or Breaking.

_Four_.

As Master-Card, is figured the existence of an obstinate Sentiment
toward one, or an Opinion not of our own building up. Influenced
by the like suit, it is troublesome, causing thought, new to one, or
burdensome. By a Diamond, it is known to others, or guessed. By
a Club, it is apt to lead to acts officious or of manoeuvre. By a
Spade, it is a Sentiment based on error and lack of full insight; or
it will be abruptly weakened.

_Three_.

An Act of Charity and Generosity, by or toward the Querist, if
read as Master-Card. Influenced by like suit, Action in a matter of
very confidential sort. By a Diamond, it is in part a Matter of
Money or Office or from a Superiour--and may be associated with
an investment, a society, an entertainment. By a Club, it figures a

matter is enjoined, or the Loss of a good will; or a Surprise not
welcome wholly.

_Two_.

As Master-Card, favorable News, or a Letter acceptable. If
influenced by its like suit, the Person from whom it comes, or also
referred to in it, is much valued, or a near Relative. By a Diamond,
a Present, a Visit, a Meeting of service, a Letter, respectively. By a
Club, a "yes" in a matter open. By a Spade, it concerns Another
more than the Querist; or else will not be altogether correct in
statement.

As Master-Card, is figured as within the Querist's life, a Relative,

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
