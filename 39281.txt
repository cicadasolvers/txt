PREFACE.


Long before writing and books were in common use, proverbs were the
principal means of imparting instruction. In modern times there is not
so much need to apply these old sayings as a means of educating the
people, but they are still constantly met with in the newspapers and in
general literature, and they are rightly considered as "The texts of
common life."

The late Earl Russell very aptly described a proverb as "The wisdom of
many and the wit of one." We value proverbs chiefly as moral maxims
teaching some practical lesson set forth in concise, pithy sentences,
which are fixed in the memory without effort, and retained without being
burdensome. They have been found useful for guidance in almost every
condition of life; but, on the other hand, it is quite true that many
dangerous precepts have been propounded in proverbs, and some of the
older ones gave such questionable advice, or were couched in such
objectionable language, that they have been very properly omitted from
every collection intended, as this is, for general use. Other old
proverbs have become obsolete, and as their meaning is now obscure, they
have not been included in the Dictionary.

This series of "Handy Books" would hardly be complete without a
collection of English Proverbs. Many books on the subject have been
written, but it is hoped that this collection will, in some respects, be
found to be an improvement on all its predecessors. Like _The Dictionary
of Daily Blunders_, this _Dictionary of English Proverbs_ has been
framed so as to enable the reader to find what he wants without
difficulty. The Dictionary itself is arranged according to the principal
words, and there is also a Copious Index of additional principal words.

Other modern collections profess to give an "Alphabetical Index," but
such an index is of little use when we find that it is framed on the
rule that because a proverb begins with the article _A_, it should
therefore be indexed under that letter. As, "A bald head is soon
shaven." In another similar Index we find the proverb, "'Tis the second
blow makes the fray," inserted under the letter _T_. In one index of
this kind there are no less than twenty-two pages of _A's_ and almost
as many of _The's_. Indeed the whole index is compiled without the
slightest regard to the subject of the proverbs. On this subject
Disraeli, in his essay on the "Philosophy of Proverbs," says "The
arrangement of proverbs has baffled the ingenuity of every one of their
collectors. Ray, after long premeditation, has chosen a system with the
appearance of an alphabetical order, but it turns out that his system is
no system, and his alphabet is no alphabet. After ten years' labour the
good man could only arrange his proverbs by commonplaces." In this
little Dictionary, as we have already stated, the proverbs are arranged
in alphabetical order, according to the leading words, and are
consecutively numbered. But, in order to avoid repetition (as most of
the proverbs contain, at least, two leading words), the _subject words_
are used for the Dictionary, and the other principal words will be found
in the Index, with a numerical reference to the proverb. The great
advantage of this arrangement is, that if only one important word of a
proverb be remembered, that word can be turned to in the Dictionary,
and, if not found there, will certainly be in the Index. Nearly two
thousand of the leading words are thus indexed--enough to make it almost
impossible to miss finding what is wanted. This plan has also the
effect of bringing together the proverbs on kindred subjects, which is
often a matter of importance to writers, and is, moreover, most amusing
to those who only read the book to while away a leisure hour. Ready
reference is further facilitated in the Index by the addition of
associated words. If one word only had been given, the reader might have
had to refer to eleven proverbs before he found the one he required; as,
for example, in the case of _Dog_.

It may be convenient to state that the Dictionary has been compiled
principally from Ray's collection, first published in 1670. The
remainder of the proverbs have been collected from ancient and modern
literature; but some few of them will not be found in any other
published collection.

It only remains to remind the reader that this is a collection of
ENGLISH Proverbs only; and we may appropriately conclude our Preface
with a further extract from Disraeli's essay, wherein he very justly
remarks that "The experience of life will throw a perpetual freshness
over these short and simple texts; every day may furnish a new
commentary; and we may grow old and still find novelty in proverbs by
their perpetual application."

Useful knowledge. . . . Invaluable alike as desk or pocket companion.
. . . Treats of the multitude of errors daily made in speaking and
writing, and offers corrections collected from the best authorities. Its
dictionary form enables any one in doubt to readily turn to the word

which appear to be ineradicable, and will not be corrected, even if the
Blunder Dictionary arrives at its thousandth edition. . . . Next to the
slave who attended a Roman Emperor in triumph to remind him that he was
mortal . . . surely the object most to be dreaded is the editor of a
Dictionary of Blunders, arranged on such a complete and systematic
plan, as to form a court of appeal to which every household can be
conveniently referred. . . . The volume is actually published, and
contains 126 closely printed pages, containing examples of errors that
are to be found in the daily speech even of well-educated persons. . . .
The Editor is to be thanked for his useful book.--_Daily Telegraph._

Pleasantly written. . . . In its dimensions it is handy, and the utility
of its contents is beyond question. The legion of "self-educated" men
who adorn our age should not be without this useful companion, for, by
its aid, the blunders of speech more particularly common to them would
be advantageously avoided.--_Citizen._

So far as we can discover from a brief perusal of the handy little
volume, the author's work has been very well done.--_AthenA|um._

A well-meant attempt to keep people clear of some common errors. . . .
There is certainly evidence enough, of one kind or another, in the
volume before us, of the existence of blunders which could hardly have
been suspected.--_Saturday Review._

Beautifully printed. . . . may be confidently recommended to those for
whose use it is designed.--_Manchester Guardian._

. . . Of value, and worth knowing. . . . Amusing, and to an extent,
useful also.--_Dublin Freeman's Journal._

Will be found useful and amusing. . . . It is arranged alphabetically,
and contains a considerable vocabulary of words supposed to present a
difficulty either in spelling, meaning, or pronunciation. Some of the
comments on popular mistakes are very well done.--_Record._

Those who are not quite sure as to their grammar, their pronunciation,
or their spelling, will doubtless find this pocket volume very
useful.--_Sunday Times._

Will be of use to every one who has either to speak or to write. As this
embraces all mankind, the book may be said to be of value to everybody.
Very neatly got up.--_Scotsman._

A glance through the pages of this book is very amusing, almost as
entertaining as a selection of wit and humour would be. There is no
doubt as to the general accuracy and usefulness of the corrections.
. . . . We heartily recommend the Dictionary.--_Liverpool Albion._

Corrected from the best authorities and arranged in alphabetical
order. . . . The student can turn readily to the remarks made upon any
particular mistake.--_Dublin Evening Mail._

A useful aid to correct speech.--_Literary World._

The value of a book is not always to be reckoned by its size. This
little dictionary would go into the waistcoat pocket, yet every word in
it has its value, and the common mistakes in speaking and writing which
it undertakes to correct are nearly always put right in the best way. In
a few instances in which we are inclined to criticise, a conflict of
opinion among the authorities would probably be found to
exist.--_Bookseller._

A manual such as this will not be out of place at the right hand of all
who desire not to blunder.--_Dundee Advertiser._

An excellent little book, which cannot be too well known or too widely
circulated. We know a large number of persons who would preserve
themselves from perpetrating the most unfortunate blunders if they would
carefully consult it.--_Christian World._

The compiler of _A Dictionary of Daily Blunders_ at least deserves
credit for an excellent idea. . . . Even the most practised speaker or
writer is liable to momentary uncertainty about simple points of
pronunciation or spelling--not to say construction of sentences. . . .
Contains some good material. . . . A useful feature of the book is the
publication in full of participles, in the spelling of which a writer is
often apt to get confused, and which are rarely included in
dictionaries.--_Nottingham Guardian._

Evidently at great pains, the author of this useful handbook has brought
together a large number of blunders which are heard often in speaking
and seen in writing. We have gone rather minutely over the work, and can
say that the corrections are nearly all just. . . . The book will be
useful to many, and the reader will be surprised to find in what a great
number of instances he is wrong in the usage and pronunciation of words.
We recommend this handbook heartily.--_Dundee Courier._

We can speak highly of this publication. . . . A credit to the publishers,
and we have little doubt will have a very large circulation.--_Wigan
Observer._

The selection has been very judiciously made. One must be a remarkably
faultless speaker and writer who does not get several useful hints from
this booklet.--_Aberdeen Journal._

. . . There is in this small volume a good deal of really useful matter,
and many readers (especially among those who are also writers) might
derive more benefit from its study than would by themselves be
imagined.--_Exchange._




_Excerpts from the Press Notices of Familiar Latin Quotations and
Proverbs._


A translation of the Latin phrases which are of most common use in the
literature of the day, which is likely to be useful.--_The Echo._

In a cheap and handy little volume we have here a large selection of
Latin phrases, proverbs, and quotations. It is ample in all respects,
and is likely to be of great and general utility.--_Sunday Times._

To newspaper men, public speakers, and correspondents in every
direction, this little "Vade mecum" will prove most
useful.--_News-Vendor._

The English translations are given as literally as possible, and they
frequently embrace all the most generally accepted renderings. So far as
we have been able to detect, the book has been carefully edited by a
competent and capable writer.--_Railway Fly-Sheet._

A small work of reference such as has been greatly needed. We recommend
it especially to all readers who want to understand what they read, and
do not know Latin, and to all writers who want to seem more learned than
they are.--_Civil Service Review._

A very handy selection of "Familiar Latin Quotations and Proverbs," of
which not only translations but also explanations are given. We
confidently recommend this little book.--_Printers' Register._

A very handy little book. It contains, arranged in alphabetical order,
all the most common Latin quotations with their signification, and many
which are not so well known. The author has been careful in doing his
work, and has produced a really good little book of
reference.--_Scotsman._

To those whose classical education has been wholly neglected the work
will be found to be a suitable "Vade mecum," and even to those who
learnt a good deal of Latin at school it will be found to be highly
useful.--_North British Advertiser._

It is a most admirable compilation. We can heartily recommend it as a
book of reference, and from which most genuine instruction can be
extracted.--_Glasgow Citizen._

In this handy little book the compiler has collected the Latin
quotations which occur most frequently in the serial literature of the
day, arranging them alphabetically along with translations. This is
truly a "handy referential volume," and deserving of a large
sale.--_Edinburgh Courant._

A very useful little work which will be invaluable to the reader whose
studies have not included the classic languages. In the space of 120
pages are compressed no fewer than fifteen hundred Latin words, phrases,
and proverbs, frequently met with in newspapers, political or
philosophical works, law books, etc. We have looked over the book
carefully, and tested it by searching for less usual quotations; but in
every case we have found what we sought. Each phrase is rendered as
literally as the construction of the English and Latin languages will
admit; and where necessary a paraphrase or explanation is appended in
addition.--_Irish Times._




_FAMILIAR ENGLISH QUOTATIONS._


The object of this little volume is to trace the Familiar Quotations so
constantly in use to their proper authorship, and to correct the errors
so frequently made by public speakers and writers. The origin of such
everyday sayings as

     "He that fights and runs away,
     May turn and fight another day,"

(erroneously supposed to be in Butler's "Hudibras,") and a number of
other phrases of a like character, is given, and the _exact place_ of
them in the different authors' works is recorded.

The errors constantly made in quoting are remarkable. The author of
an interesting volume, comprising many well-known passages, names
"Hudibras" as containing the lines

     "They that in quarrels interpose,
     Will often wipe a bloody nose."

In an essay on "Misquotations," which recently appeared in a very ably
conducted newspaper, the object of the writer being to _correct_ the
blunders constantly made, he falls into the usual mistake of quoting
Nat. Lee as writing

     "When Greek meets Greek, then comes the tug of war,"

and a learned and eminent divine, a certain Dr. B., some years ago, in
the presence of a large party, obstinately insisted that

     "A man convinced against his will"

was a correct passage from "Hudibras," and was only satisfied as to his
blunder by the production of Butler's immortal work. Even so
accomplished a scholar as Mr. Gladstone--_quandoque bonus dormitat
Homerus_--errs; in a recently published number of the _Nineteenth
Century_, quoting Byron's words,

     "The bubbling cry
     Of some strong swimmer in his agony,"

he names them as occurring in "Childe Harold," instead of in "Don Juan."

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
