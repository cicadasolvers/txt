                          Son and Heire to the Right
                      Honourable RICHARD _Lord_ ROBERTS
                     of _Truro_: the Vnualuable Riches of
                     sincere Grace here, and of Eternall
                              Glory hereafter.


                                HONOVRABLE SIR,

  Although it bee true (which a       |
  worthy Diuine[a] obserueth) that    | [Note a: M^r. _Bolter_ Disc. of
  formall Hypocrites are heartned and | true Happinesse, p. 61.]
  hardned in their lewd courses &     |
  false conceits of happinesse, when  |
  they heare more infamous Sinners    |
  than themselues, gloriously and     |
  flatteringly commended at their     |
  Deaths; yet we need not feare any   |
  such bad effect by the              |
  Funerall-commendation of Gods true  |
  Saints; because the publike         |
  Testimonie of their iust Praises    |
  doth not onely make the wicked more |
  inexcusable, and the Glory of Gods  |
  Graces shine farre brighter to      |
  Posteritie; but also enkindleth in  |
  the hearts of the godly a greater   |
  fire of Zeale for imitation. These  | [Note b: _Psalm. 37. 37. Deut.
  are some of the Ends, why it hath   | 34. 7, 10, 11, 12. Hebr._ 3. 2. &

  vnreproueable Custome in Gods       |
  Church, that the Godly should be    | [Note c: _2 Chron. 32. 33._]
  _Marked_[b] and _Honoured_[c] at    |
  their Deaths, as _Hezekiah_ was by  |
  all _Iudah_ & _Ierusalem_:          |

  such as are truly beautified,       |

  their Humble Soules[A]. This praise |
  the Lord will Prosper[g], which is  | [Note g: _Eccles. 15. 10._]
  vttered in that _Wisdome_[h],       |
  whereof the _Feare of the Lord is   | [Note h: _Prou. 9. 10._]
  the beginning_. But for the Saints  |
  themselues: I dare say with Saint   | [Note i: _Epist. 125._ where S.
  _Augustine_[i], that they desire    | _Augustine_ refuseth to commend

  Commendation of their vertues: and  | wife that was dead, not onely
  therefore to tell you the truth (as | because she desired not his praise,
  the same Father doth his friend)    | saying: _Laudem ab hominibus iam

  from the holy Fathers[l], whereof I |
  need not to be ashamed) may be      | [Note l: _--Ingenuo pudore qui

  and eternally Glorifie your Soule   |
  and Bodie in Heauen. Abandon then I |
  beseech you in the name of          |
  Christ[m], all iniquitie, and all   | [Note m: _2 Thess. 3. 6. 2 Tim.

  able to encline and enlarge them    |
  to the pursuit and practise of so   |
  excellent and Glorious a Grace as   |
  the _Feare of the Lord_; because    |
  this godly Feare and the impenitent |
  Allowance of any lust, is as        |
  incompatible as Heauen and Hell: so |
  that if you should hate to be       |
  diuorced from your Bosome-sin       |
  whatsoeuer it be (which God forbid) |
  you could haue no true right and    |
  interest to the precious promises   |
  of this and of that other life[n].  | [Note n: _1 Tim. 4. 8._]
  Thinke on this continually, and     |
  hold it your greatest Honour, the   |
  Noblest imployment of your Soule,   |
  as it is indeed, to keep your selfe |
  (as a King[o] did before you.) from | [Note o: _Psal. 18. 23._]
  your iniquitie. _Quod si tu (quod   |

                                THE PRAISE OF A
                                  Godly Woman.


                                  PROV. 31. 30.

                  _--But a woman that feareth the Lord, shee
                                shall be praised._

  Praise is a Debt (saith _Gregory    |
  Nazianzen_[a]) and it must be paid, | [Note a: _Orat. 25. fol. 439. Rom.
  not to men alone, but to women      | 13. 7, 8._]
  also; yet not to euery woman, be    |
  shee neuer so noble, wittie,        | [Note: The Diuision.]
  wealthy or faire[b], vnlesse she be |
  godly withall: For _fauour is       | [Note b: _Non possumus reprehendere
  deceitfull, and beautie is vaine;   | diuini artificis opus; sed quem
  but a woman that feareth the Lord,  | delectat corporis pulchritudo,
  shee shall be praised_.             | multo magis illa delectet venustas,
                                      | quae ad imaginem, Dei est intus, non
  A promise this is and affirmatiue,  | foris comptior. S. Ambr. Instit.
  and an affirmatiue promise hath two | Virg. c. 4. Prou. 11. 22. Eccle.
  parts in it. The first is the       | 11. 2. ... Homo igitur mihi non tam
  Partie to whom it is made, and shee | vultu quam affectu admirand^s
  is _Muliertimens Dominum_. _A woman | emineat atque excellat: vt in his
  that feareth the Lord_, which is    | laudatur, in quibus etiam Deus
  also the reason why she shall be    | prophetico iudicio laudatur de quo
  praised: euen because she is _a     | scriptum est Psal. 66. 5.
  woman fearing the Lord_. The second | Terribilis in consiliis super
  is the thing promised, and that is  | filios hominum; cuius opera coram
  _Laudabitur, she shall be praised_. | Deo luceant, qui bona iugibus
                                      | operibus facta contexat. Id. ib.
                                      | cap. 3._]
  In the former, it is not enough     |
  that she is a woman, because        | [Note I.]
  euery woman is not _Timens_, one    |
  that _Feareth_, nor sufficient that | [Note c: _Naturale vocabul[=u] est
  she _Feareth_; because euery woman  | Foemina. naturalis vocabuli
  that feareth is not _Timens         | generale, Mulier.--Tert. de Virg.
  Dominum_, one _that feareth the     | Veland. cap 4._]
  Lord_; but _she_ that _shall be     |
  praised_, is all three. 1. A woman  | [Note d: _Aliud est Timere
  by nature[c], where the weaker her  | simpliciter, aliud Timere
  sex is, the more shee shall be      | Deum----quippe timere & amare
  commended. 2. By Grace[d], _a woman | simpliciter prolata, affectione:
  that feareth_, where the continuall | cu^m additamento aute virtutes
  act of this Fearing is required. 3. | signific[=a]t. Simplices nempe
  _That feareth the Lord_, where the  | affectiones insunt naturaliter
  right Obiect of her continuall      | nobis tanquam ex nobis, Additamenta
  feare is limited.                   | ex Gratia. S. Bern. de Grat. & lib.
                                      | Arb._]
  And in the latter we are to         |
  consider; First, to what matters,   | [Note II.]
  _Laudabitur_, her praise will       |
  reach, and in what respect to       |
  _Ipsa_ Her person. Then secondly,   |
  When _she shall be praised_; not    |
  for the present, perhaps, no more   |
  than she hath beene heretofore; yet |
  _Laudabitur_, the time will come    |
  when _she shall be praised_, and    |
  then too her praise shall so be,    |
  that it shall be still. Thirdly, of |
  whom shee shall haue praise, for    |
  _Laudabitur_ is an action, and must |
  bee done of some agent, therefore   |
  we must finde who shal praise her,  |
  and they will fall out to be her    |
  Husband and her Children (if she    |
  haue them[e]) and if they faile in  | [Note e: _Mulier enim no natura
  this dutie, then the godly shall    | nomen est vxoris, sed vxor
  praise her; and if they cease to    | coditione nomen est mulieris. Tert.
  doe it, then her own workes shall   | ib. c. 5. Gen. 2. 23. Haec vocabitur
  praise her, yea rather than faile,  | mulier, quoniam de viro suo sumpta
  God himselfe shall praise her,      | est: Quia sumpta est (inquit) de
  which is best of all. So sure she   | viro suo, non quia virum experta
  is to be praised, not for the       | ... Non enim corruptelae, sed sexus
  present onely, but for euer. And so | vocabulum est. Gal. 4. 4. Luke 1.
  this Text besides that it is a      | 28. S. Ambr. ibid. c. 5._]
  _Promise_, it is also a _Motiue_ to |
  stirre vs vp to feare God, that so  | [Note: A Promise, and Motiue.]
  we also may haue true and eternall  |
  praise of God. It is both, and      | [Note: _I. The partie that shall be
  both waies wee to haue vse of it,   | praised._]
  as of a _Promise_, and as of a      |
  _Motiue_: both these waies at once; |
  _A woman that feareth the Lord she  |
  shall be praised._                  |
                                      |
  A weake sex[f] to beginne with, and | [Note f: _1 Pet. 3. 7. Ier. 50.
  yet being strengthned by Grace[g],  | 37. Nah. 3. 13. Gal. 3. 27, 28._]
  no impediment; but that a woman as  |
  wel as a man may feare the Lord,    | [Note g: _--Ex parte natura (nisi
  and haue praise of him, and so      | sit fortitude maioris gratiae)
  become the partie who shall, and    | facilius incarnatur ad malum sexus
  one Reason too, why _shee shall be  | formineus. Bonau. L. 2. d. 21. q.
  praised_.                           | 3. p. 18._]
                                      |
  For a woman must be more good than  |
  nature, art, policie, preferment    |
  can make her, else shee is not good |
  enough for Gods Spirit to praise    |
  her. He commends neither men nor    |
  women considered in their pure      |
  Naturalls only, in that estate of   |
  corruption, they all heare alike to | [Note h: _Rom. 3. 9._]
  their disgrace, that they are _All  |
  vnder sinne[h]_, _All come[i] short | [Note i: _Rom. 3. 23._]
  of the glory of God_, and are _All  |
  the children of[k] wrath_, because  | [Note k: _Ephes. 2. 3._]
  they _Are without all feare of      |
  God_[l]                             | [Note l: _Rom. 3. 18._]
                                      |
  By nature then both sexes are alike |
  faultie, alike disc[=o]mendable in  |
  Gods sight, and so they should be   |
  in ours. We should not dispraise    |
  women more than men, for the sex    |
  sake only (as some doe[m]) because  | [Note m: _Eurip. Plutarc. de
  they haue as noble soules as men,   | Tranquilit Mulier quantibuis proba,
  for[n] soules haue no sexes, (as    | Mulier tamen est._]
  Saint _Ambrose_ saith) nor praise   |
  women for the endowments of the     | [Note n: _Anima enim sexum non
  flesh onely (as othersome doe[o])   | habet.--De Virg. som. 1. lib: 3.
  vnlesse they be adorned also with   | fol. 99._]
  the sauing Graces of the Spirit,    |
  whereof a chiefe one is not noble   | [Note o: _Cornel. Agrip. de
  birth, great wealth, excellent wit, | Nobilit. foeminei sexus. Bocacius
  or rare beautie: but _the feare of  | de claris mulieribus._]
  the Lord_, his treasure.[A] This    |
  godly feare is that, that makes a   | [Note A: _Es. 33. 6._]
  Woman in relation[p] to God,        |
  praise-worthy. And good reason it   | [Note p: _Caiet. in. loc._]
  should do so, if we regard the      |
  weaknesse of a woman, in whom so    |
  excellent a Grace as _the feare of  |
  the Lord_, is found, and the        |
  Noblenesse of fearing the Lord,     |
  being so found.                     |
                                      |
  First, a womans weaknesse is        |
  naturally[q] greater than the mans, | [Note q: _Naturaliter etiam maior

  nor of Euery one[l], for Praise is  |
  not comely in the mouth of euery    | [Note l: _Luk. 6. 26. Eccles. 15.

                                      |
  But first of the Time.              | [Note m: _Esay 28. 16. 30. 18. 40.
                                      | 31. 64. 4. Heb. 10. 36, 37, 38.
  Many when they heare a Promise (and | Hab. 2. 3, 4._]
  a Promise I told you at first, this |
  is) thinke to haue it by and by;    | [Note n: _1 Cor. 4. 5._]
  but they marke not, that a Promise  |
  and the Fruition of it is not all   | [Note o: _1 Pet. 1. 7. Et nos
  at once. It must be waited for[m],  | ergo n[=o] a nobis laudem exigamus,
  especially this Promise of Praise:  | nec praeripiamus iudicium Dei &
  _Vntill the Lord come_ (as the      | praeueniamus sententiam iudicis, sed
  Apostles limit the Time) _and       | suo Tempori, suo Iudici

  and Glory_. Therefore in the mean   | [Note p: _Nam si laudari ante

  1. Not only because it is safest    | Ambr. de Bono Mort. c. 8. tom. 4.
  praising Her as a Master of a ship  | Merito ergo differtur, vt sequatur

  swolne with others commending him,  | nudantur opera eius. Id. Instit.
  that (as _Arrianus_ reports) it     | Virg. c. 3. tom. 1._]
  grew greater than two Cubits[r].    |
                                      | [Note q: _Act. 12. 21._]
  2. Nor only because actuall praise  |
  is in the lips of the praiser, and  | [Note r: _Arrian. Epict. l. 3. c.
  so a wicked woman may be praised,   | 2._]
  and yet not be worthy of it, and a  |
  godly woman may be praise-worthy,   |
  and yet not haue it, whereas        |
  praise-worthinesse is euer in the   |
  partie to be praised, and fewest    |
  (you know) haue this worth; but     |
  many haue praise without it,        |
  therefore praise-worthinesse is the |
  Nobler Grace of the two, and        |
  consequently best for a Woman to be |
  worthy of praise, though she be not |
  praised for the present.            |
                                      |
  3. But one of the chiefest Reasons  |
  is this; because indeed all our     |
  earthly praise is _Laudatur_, that  |
  is, for the present; but continueth |
  not. Is, but shall not be.          |
  Sometimes a godly woman is          |
  commended, and sometimes she is     |
  not. As S. _Paul_ praised the       |
  _Corinthians_[s], _Now I praise you | [Note s: _1 Cor. 11. 1, 22_]
  Brethren_, and by and by he saith:  |
  _Shall I praise you in this? I      |
  praise you not_: whereas This       |
  praise here promised so Is, that it |
  _shall be_ still, and that cannot   |
  be in this Transitory world; but in |
  Heauen, where Her praise that       |
  feareth the Lord for euer, endureth |
  for euer: _Laudabitur, She shall be |
  praised_.                           |
                                      |
  The best Time then for commending   | [Note: III.
  Her is yet to come, and that from   | _Of whom shee shal be praised._]
  Him who can best doe it; But I must |
  tell you first, this Time should    | [Note t: _2 Kings 9. 11. Act. 24.
  neuer come, could the scoffing      | 5. & 26. 24. Neh. 6. 13._]

  railing vpon, iesting at, belying   | [Note u: _Tert. Apolog. c. 7. &c.

  many disgracefull censures to dimme | [Note x: _Gratias ago Deo meo, quod
  the glory of the children of Light, | dignus sum, quem mundus oderit._
  spitefully to aggrauate their       | _S. Ierom. Asellae._]
  tender frailties, rather than to    |
  commend their vnreproueable Graces. | [Note y: _Ephes. 5. 15. Phil. 4.

  verse of this Chapter, saying:      |
  _Many daughters haue done           |
  vertuously; but thou excellest them |
  all_[f]: or should the Godly cease  | [Note f: _Prou. 31. 28, 29._]

  yet who is such a Woman? We haue    |

  chiefly by reason of that spiritual |
  Helpe and refreshment, which they   |
  might get by conuersing with Her in |
  the choicest passages of            |
  Sanctification. For shee had the    |
  Art to vphold holy conferences      |
  about perplexities of conscience,   |
  Relapses into sin, and Remedies     |
  against the same: Shee had the      |

  the Death of any of Gods zealous    | [Note e: _Paulin. in Vita D.

  solitary conferences with her God,  |
  feruent prayers and eiaculations,   |
  which (as the sweetest incense)     |
  shee euer and anon sent vp to the   |

  her sinnes, the fauour of God, the  |

  home, being summoned by Sicknesse,  |
  by and by she set her _House in     |
  order_, like _Hezekiah_; She spake  |
  to the Hearts of Her Children,      |
  Friends, and Seruants, that were    |
  then about Her (like _Iacob_) by    |
  putting them in remembrance of Her  |
  Departure and their Duties: She     |
  hungered and thirsted after the     |
  Body and Bloud of Her Dearest       | [Note: _Worthy receiving the

                                      |
  And now (Beloued) that she lieth on |
  the bed of Languishing, we must not |
  be austere in reprehending euery    |
  Infirmity; but Pitifull in          |

  Consider therefore O Man (as that   |

  must much more beare with a fraile  |
  Minde and Body too. Consider also O |
  Man, that this her Pettishnesse did |
  more wound her to the heart, than   |
  any iniury thou couldst presse her  |
  with. Neither doe I speake this to  |
  nourish passion in any, or to proue |
  her Anger to be Sinlesse[s]; but to | [Note s: _Vitemus ergo aut

  Faith quenched the flame of this    |
  fiery passion in Christs Bloud,     |
  resolued and melted her heart into  |
  many penitent Teares afterwards.    | [Note: _Repentance for the same._]
  Oh, said she to me, (pressing her   |
  with _Dauids_ example, _Psal.       |

  any iniury, and deemed it base and  |
  vngodly, not to be able to doe so;  |
  but now (I know not how) me thinkes |
  I am ouer-tender in bearing them. I |
  am impatient indeed, and then I     |
  weepe for my impatiencie. For I     |
  know (as she her selfe vrged) _The  |
  wrath of Man doth not accomplish    | [Note t: _Iam. 1. 20. Psalm. 4.

  without renting his owne heart from |

  vnlesse he forsake betimes, will    |
  bring him to euerlasting            | [Note x: _Ezek. 18. 13, 30._]

  of this her Agonie, after shee had  |

  any articulate or distinct speech,  |
  yet vpon triall made of Her sense   |
  and memory by demanding of Her,     |
  whether she would haue prayers made |
  for Her, she answered plainly: With |
  all my heart, pray, pray. And then  |
  as _Gregory Nazianzen_[a] reports   | [Note a: _Orat. 28. de Funere
  of his Father, that though He was   | Patris. Tom. 2._]
  daily, yea hourely, in great paine  |

  still and quiet from paine, onely   |
  while Diuine Seruice was saying; so |

  rehearsing distinctly part of the   |
  Lords Prayer, you might heare Her,  |
  when S. _Stephens_ Vision and last  |
  words[b] were read vnto Her, repeat | [Note b: _Act. 7. 53, 56, 59._]
  very often these last words of Her  |
  Sauiour[c]: _O Heauenly Father into | [Note c: _Luke 23. 46._]
  thy hands I commend my spirit_.     |
  Thus on a sudden I haue told you    | [Note A: _Reuel. 14. 13._]
  how she _Dyed in the Lord_[A], and  |
  is _with Christ_[B].                | [Note B _Phil. 1. 23._]
                                      |
  And though we saw her afterwards    |
  mouing her lips; but heard not her  |
  Voice, no more than they that were  |
  at Saint _Ambroses_ Death did heare | [Note d: _Paulin. in D. Ambros
  his Voice; but only saw his lips    | Vita._]
  moue[d]; yet we must not thinke     |
  _The Spirit of strength_[e], of     | [Note e: _Esai. 11. 2._]
  _Prayer_ and _Grace_[f], is then    |
  onely strong, when we heare a Dying | [Note f: _Zach. 12. 10._]
  Saint pray, because Christs Spirit  |
  cries in Gods Children, _Abba,      |
  Father_[g], with Vnutterable        | [Note g: _Gal. 4. 6._]
  Groanings[h] which we cannot heare, |
  and therefore I doubt not, but this | [Note h: _Rom. 8. 26._]
  Elect Lady cried loudest in Gods    |
  eares, when we heard not her words; |
  and why may we not thinke now, our  |
  sinnes hindered vs from hearing     |
  them? I am sure, heretofore she     |
  hath spoken againe and againe many  |
  Heart-piercing speeches to deterre  |
  from Sinne, and to allure to        |
  Holinesse of Life. If she be not    |
  hearkened to now, henceforth wee    |
  shall heare Her speake no more. _I  |
  charge you therefore before God and |
  the Lord Iesus Christ, and the      |
  Elect Angells_:[A] you (I say) I    | [Note A: _1 Tim. 5. 21._]
  charge whomsoeuer shee hath iustly  |
  reproued for any Sin, that you      |
  forsake those Sins; and whomsoeuer  |
  she hath zealously exhorted to holy |
  Duties, that you performe those     |
  holy Duties, for henceforth you     |
  shall heare Her speake no more.     |
                                      |
  But why should I detaine thee       | [Note: _Conclusion. Sed quid ego te

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
