For Instant Use

    As a reliable remedy, in cases of Croup, Whooping Cough, or
    sudden Colds, and for the prompt relief and cure of throat and
    lung diseases, Ayer's Cherry Pectoral is invaluable. Mrs. E. G.
    Edgerly, Council Bluffs, Iowa, writes: "I consider Ayer's Cherry
    Pectoral a most important remedy for home use. I have tested its
    curative power, in my family, many times during the past thirty
    years, and have never known it to fail. It will relieve the most
    serious affections of the throat and lungs, whether in children
    or adults." John H. Stoddard, Petersburg, Va., writes: "I have
    never found a medicine equal to

    AYER'S
    Cherry Pectoral

    for the prompt relief of throat and lung diseases peculiar to
    children. I consider it an absolute cure for all such affections,
    and am never without it in the house." Mrs. L. E. Herman, 187
    Mercer St., Jersey City, writes: "I have always found Ayer's
    Cherry Pectoral useful in my family." B. T. Johnson, Mt. Savage,
    Md., writes: "For the speedy cure of sudden Colds, and for the
    relief of children afflicted with Croup, I have never found
    anything equal to Ayer's Cherry Pectoral. It is the most potent
    of all the remedies I have ever used." W. H. Stickler, Terre
    Haute, Ind., writes: "Ayer's Cherry Pectoral cured my wife of a
    severe lung affection, supposed to be Quick Consumption. We now
    regard the Pectoral as a household necessity." E. M.
    Breckenridge, Brainerd, Minn., writes: "I am subject to
    Bronchitis, and, wherever I go, am always sure to have a bottle
    of

    Ayer's Cherry Pectoral

    with me. It is without a rival for the cure of bronchial
    affections."

INDIGESTION

    To strengthen the stomach, create an appetite, and remove the
    horrible depression and despondency which result from
    Indigestion, there is nothing so effective as Ayer's Pills. These
    Pills contain no calomel or other poisonous drug, act directly on
    the digestive and assimilative organs, and restore health and
    strength to the entire system. T. P. Bonner, Chester, Pa.,
    writes: "I have used Ayer's Pills for the past 30 years, and am
    satisfied I should not have been alive to-day, if it had not been
    for them. They

    Cured

    me of Dyspepsia when all other remedies failed, and their
    occasional use has kept me in a healthy condition ever since." L.
    N. Smith, Utica, N. Y., writes: "I have used Ayer's Pills, for
    Liver troubles and Indigestion, a good many years, and have
    always found them prompt and efficient in their action." Richard
    Norris, Lynn, Mass., writes: "After much suffering, I have been
    cured of Dyspepsia and Liver troubles

    By Using

    Ayer's Pills. They have done me more good than any other medicine
    I have ever taken." John Burdett, Troy, Iowa, writes: "For nearly
    two years my life was rendered miserable by the horrors of
    Dyspepsia. Medical treatment afforded me only temporary relief,
    and I became reduced in flesh, and very much debilitated. A
    friend of mine, who had been similarly afflicted, advised me to
    try Ayer's Pills. I did so, and with the happiest results. My
    food soon ceased to distress me, my appetite returned, and I
    became as strong and well as ever."

The receipts published in this number bring us to the end of the
first three months of our fiscal year. The summary given above shows
how we stand as compared with last year. Total compared with total,
we are behind. May we not, however, hope that the turning-point will
soon be reached, and that all through the rest of the year it shall
be our privilege to chronicle a steady increase? We are out in the
current of our work. We cannot turn back. The thirteen thousand
dollar deficit from the last year adds to our solicitude. We ask our
friends to keep their eyes upon the figures as we publish them from
month to month. They will prove to be very suggestive teachers.

       *       *       *       *       *

The papers are having a good deal to say these days about "hard
times." Capital is sensitive and seeks cover at the slightest alarm.
People hesitate about investing when they feel uncertain as to
security. Benevolent societies are the first to feel the depression
of business reverse. This fact is a storm signal whose significance
we should sacredly heed. It proclaims danger, yet a danger that, with
thought and prudence, can be averted. There are many whose gifts have
come to us from an overflowing abundance. Suppose, now, that they
should join the grand army of self-sacrificing givers that, at such a
stress as hard times produce, is in sore need of recruits; suppose,
farther, that by personal effort new contributors are secured, and
then suppose some of the capital that may be withdrawn from
investment for fear of loss, instead of being hidden away or placed
under lock and key, should be sent out into the active service of the
Lord, and be converted into redeemed souls and regenerated manhood.
Just let these suppositions be realized, and the danger threatened
will never be encountered. If the readers of the MISSIONARY will
think, pray, talk and preach along such lines as the above
suppositions mark out, we are confident that we shall be brought
safely and triumphantly through. What if the record should show
larger gifts in the treasury of the Lord than were ever known in
times of acknowledged business prosperity! From the Christian
stand-point, why not?

       *       *       *       *       *

OUR ROLL OF HONOR.


We publish this month the names of our missionaries and the stations
at which they are located. These names constitute our Roll of Honor.
We are proud of them. Some of them are the names of old and
long-tried veterans, the story of whose experience is full of romance
and thrilling interest. All of them are the names of men and women
who have made themselves of no reputation because of the work in
which they are engaged. And what is that work? The salvation of the
lost. The enlightenment of the ignorant. The elevation of the
degraded.

It is surely very strange that opposition should be encountered in
such work. It would seem as if it ought to have the benedictions of
the good and the well wishes even of the bad. And yet the fact is,
the good names of these missionaries are evilly spoken of; many times
their personal safety has been imperilled, and they have been, and
still are, made social outlaws because of their work.

This is not as it ought to be. It is not as it will be. Truth is
steadily pushing for the light. Right is constantly asserting its
claim for recognition. Old prejudices and false customs die hard;
but their doom is written, and die they must. Problems will demand
solution, in whose clearing up will vanish many a cherished folly.
Here is such a problem for our Southern friends to solve. That most
excellent Christian scholar and divine, Rev. Atticus G. Haygood,
D.D., of Georgia, states it thus: "If, on other grounds, the teacher
is entitled to personal and social recognition, the fact of his
teaching a negro school should be no bar. Think, for example, of
people admiring David Livingstone, and then turning up their noses at
a teacher, not because he is bad, or ignorant, or ill-bred, nor yet
even because he is a negro, but, forsooth, because he teaches a negro
school! There is a very large intimation of 'sham' in this
distinction without a difference. It is utterly absurd. May it not
also be sinful?" We commend this problem to the good Christian people
among whom our missionaries dwell, for solution. They will be sure to
come out where Dr. Haygood leads them. And when they see the
absurdity of their attitude in regard to our missionaries, we believe
they will soon see the farther conclusion, namely, that it is sinful.

Meanwhile, our missionaries will keep on faithfully doing what they
believe to be right, accomplishing thus two things at once:
Witnessing for the truth and helping the needy. All honor to this
noble band of self-denying, principle-maintaining men and women. They
are standard-bearers of our advancing Christianity. They are where,
as standard-bearers, they ought to be, at the front, the post of
sacrifice and danger, but they are leading in a cause that is sure to
win.

       *       *       *       *       *

THE FREEDMAN'S CASE IN EQUITY.


This is the title of a most thorough and refreshingly candid paper
from the pen of Geo. W. Cable, published in the January _Century_.
His opening sentence, "The greatest social problem before the
American people to-day is, as it has been for a hundred years, the
presence among us of the negro," indicates his estimate of the
importance of the subject. From beginning to end the paper bears the
marks of carefulest thought, profound conviction, and loyalty to
truth. Mr. Cable is a native of Louisiana, an ex-Confederate soldier,
the son and grandson of slave-holders. He has a right to be heard. He
knows the subject. He knows the American people. He evidently
believes that nothing is ever settled that is not settled right. He
does not believe that the freedman's case has as yet been thus
settled. Moral questions will not be suppressed. If ignored in the
domain of private morals, they "spring up and expand once more into
questions of public equity; neglected as matters of public equity,
they blossom into questions of national interest; and despised in
that guise, presently yield the red fruits of revolution." On the
basis of such a principle, he argues that there will be no quiet to
the agitation until the freedman is a free man in all respects. And
he is right. We commend our readers to secure this article if
possible and read it. They will be amply repaid.

       *       *       *       *       *

We hope none of our readers will fail to read Prof. Crogman's
address, published in this number of the MISSIONARY. Prof. Crogman is
a graduate of our Atlanta University, and is now a Professor in the
Clark University, a school for colored youth in Atlanta sustained by
Methodists. The splendid tribute he pays the teachers who went South
to teach the colored people is very handsomely done--and it is just.

       *       *       *       *       *

And still the votes are coming in. Subscriptions for THE AMERICAN
MISSIONARY last month number nearly one-half the total subscriptions
of the preceding year. Most heartily do we thank our friends. There
are thousands yet to be heard from. We know fifty cents is not a very
convenient sum to send, but we beg our readers to remember that a
dollar answers for two years. _Vote early and often._ In politics,
this is not a commendable motto. In the peculiar election we are just
now trying to carry through, we put special emphasis on the _vote
early_, and yet do not object to the vote often--that is, if the
voters feel like it.

A SANITARY VIEW OF INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION.


From the time when it was made manifest that man by the sweat of his
brow must provide his bread, there has been occasion for industrial
education. Its ameliorating consequences is a good reason for it.
Indirectly, at least, it has the example of the Carpenter's Son for
its authority; His mighty works were for the most part in relief of
physical wants. An industrial education serving such ends has an
unquestionable warrant.

In the August number of THE AMERICAN MISSIONARY we gave statistics of
mortality of colored people in several Southern cities. For the last
week in May the number of deaths per 1,000 among the blacks in
Atlanta was 49, in Charleston 39, and in Richmond 50; while the death
rate among the whites in those cities was 19, 18 and 19,
respectively--less than one-half. This showing was not on account of
the negro's inaptitude for the climate; that is especially favorable
for him. It was in consequence of his ignorance of hygienic laws on
the one hand, and his inability or indisposition to observe them on
the other.

On several occasions, a few years since, colored missionaries for
Africa were submitted to a thorough medical examination, when it was
found that among the females but few were sound in body. Different
physicians informed us repeatedly that most negro women in this
country were in like unhealthy condition, for which ignorance,
poverty, neglect and wrong were chargeable. To avert such evils from
the coming generation is a part of the work of this Association. The
negro will never be at his best either for this country or Africa
until his physical condition is improved.

Looking at an industrial education simply from this point, much will
be found to emphasize its urgency. The colored people have been
limited to a very meagre variety of food. Pork with corn-bread
improperly prepared has been the chief staple of a majority of them.
In our different boarding institutions and in our schools for cookery
we teach that suitable food should be used and how it should be
prepared. The blacks are apt students in this department; they have
ability as cooks. The Southern country is capable of producing a
large variety of crops, and we seek to encourage such agricultural
industries as will be most helpful. At Berea a fruit-canning
establishment has been put in operation. At Tougaloo, truck is raised
for the Northern market. At Atlanta, experiments with a variety of
crops have been abundant and successful, so that by these simple
household and agricultural industries a good variety for invalids,
young children and others is being furnished. We are rendering great
service also by teaching our students to have care for the protection
of their persons. They need good houses; we teach them carpentry.
Their clothing has been limited and unsuitable. They are often
ignorant of what is required for health, and when and how to wear
their garments. We instruct them in their proper use, and how
clothing should be made. Exposure to wet and cold, over-exertion and
improper indulgences--these account largely for the diseases among
the females to which we have referred. We aim to remedy these evils.
Lady missionaries, lady physicians, ladies in charge of industrial
schools, one and all are mindful for the health of those to whom they
minister, and not a little of their work consists in urging the
observance of sanitary laws; and we believe that however weighty
other considerations for an industrial education are, none appeal
more powerfully to the Christian heart than those mentioned, and that
the death-rate to which we have alluded indicates that human pity, as
well as Christianity, renders such work not only timely but
imperative.

BENEFACTIONS.


Hon. S. A. Smith has given $50,000 to McGill University, Montreal,
for separate higher instruction for women.

Dr. Taylor, late President, has presented to Wooster, O., University
an additional gift of property, valued at $5,000.

E. A. Goodnow, of Worcester, has pledged the sum of $10,000 to the
Huguenot Seminary of South Africa, on the same terms as his recent
gift to Iowa College.

The $6,000 given by Mrs. Knowles for an industrial building at
Atlanta University, has provided a neat and suitable building for the
institution.

A Northern gentleman interested in the Slater work, has given $25,000
to Emory College, and other friends have pledged $30,000, for a
School of Technology in the college.

The children of the late Caleb Van Husan, of Detroit, give $6,000 to
Kalamazoo College, $2,000 to the Chicago Baptist Theological
Seminary, and $500 to the Clinton Avenue Baptist Church, It having
been their father's intention to make such gifts himself.

THE A. M. A. AT THE NEW ORLEANS EXPOSITION.


As a matter of interest to many of our readers, we here quote,
slightly abbreviated, a report of our exhibit in New Orleans, given
in the _Daily Picayune_ of that city:

     The American Missionary Association display closes the
     educational exhibits in the east gallery. It occupies large
     space and is gayly decorated with pale-blue and white draperies.
     In this display will be found a complete report for eye and mind
     of the progress made by the colored school children and by the
     Indians during the past years. Upon long tables are ranged for
     examination books in use, neatly bound, copy-books and
     innumerable specimens of drawing, fancy work, knitting and plain
     sewing, also agricultural and blacksmithing specimens from
     various training schools.

     Straight University, which has nearly 600 pupils, sends
     examination pamphlets, a number of pictures and silk embroidery.

     It is curious to note what most interests visitors in certain
     departments. Straight University sends large numbers of
     imaginary letters written by pupils from various parts of the
     world. The visiting public read these letters with as much
     avidity as if the innocent epistles were real letters, and the
     neat manuscripts are already well thumbed. One of the best
     letters, all things considered, is from a pupil from Honduras,
     who has only been studying English two years. His letter, signed
     Emilio Mazien, is first rate.

     The display from the Indian School at Santee, Neb., consists of
     school books printed in the Sioux Indian language, and these are
     a first, second and third reader, a moderately advanced
     geography, a hymn-book, and "Dakota Wowapi Wakan," or Bible in
     the Sioux tongue. A little oblong crocheted tidy is made of
     parti-colored stripes, each one the work of a young Pocahontas,
     who has added her name, age and tribe to which she belongs. In
     fact all the Indian work is thus marked--the young red men and
     maidens seeming particularly careful to give their tribe. This
     school also exhibits shoes, harness, tin cans, step ladders and
     models of household furniture. The girls have sent long linen
     bands full of buttonholes, aprons and undergarments finely
     hemmed.

     The Atlanta University sends silk-worms, cocoons, a neatly drawn
     map of the city, and fine examples of free-hand drawings applied
     with colors.

     The kindergarten exhibits from Storrs Atlanta school are very
     cunning, and the photograph of the ebony kindergarteners, taken
     while at their tasks, is like a picture. The work of the
     children, braided wraps, embroidered animals and paper
     contrivances, will compare favorably with any kindergarten in
     the country.

     The exhibit from the Hampton Institute, Virginia, is placed upon
     a pedestal. This school is properly a State Agricultural
     University for the negro race in Virginia and for such Indians
     as may be sent to it by the National Government. It has 600
     members, and these have sent some very fine harness, woolen work
     and carpentry work.

     A curious display from the Gregory Institute, Wilmington, N. C.,
     teaches quite a lesson in domestic economy. The girls have sent
     specimens of "stocking darning" and of that still more
     economical and homely employment known as "re-footing old
     stockings." A patchwork quilt made by the boys, forms a part of
     this display. Looking over the exhibits made under the American
     Missionary Association, the writer is pleasantly impressed with
     the excellent care with which the colored and Indian pupils all
     over the country are being instructed in trades. As cooks,
     carpenters, blacksmiths, farmers, brick-makers they are being
     practically instructed, as well as being given good collegiate
     educations.

     The display of drawings from the Le Moyne Institute, of Memphis,
     is exceedingly beautiful and attracts universal admiration, as
     being most artistic and complete.

THANKSGIVING ADDRESS AT ATLANTA UNIVERSITY.

BY. PROF. W. A. CROGMAN.


If I were asked to-day what one thing since the close of the war has
contributed most to the permanent prosperity of the South, I should
unhesitatingly answer, Christian charity--that charity which has
exhibited itself not only in the giving of gifts, not only in the
lavish expenditure of immense sums for the elevation of the degraded
masses; but by its prayers, by its sentiments promptly and fearlessly
expressed against wrong, by its patient endurance, and by its
individual sacrifices made in a field which could promise but little
more to the laborer than the reward of conscience for having served
at a critical period his country and his kind. It is just nineteen
years since the surrender at Appomattox, nineteen short years. But
what events have crowded into that brief period! What stupendous
changes have been wrought within that time in American society,
especially in Southern society!--changes as radical in their nature
as they will be far-reaching in their consequences. It is true that
these changes have not always been accompanied by peace and quiet and
good feeling. This was hardly to be expected. There have been
bloodshed and murders. There have been individual sufferings.
Thousands have perished by violence and privation. But what, after
all, are the sufferings of the thousands compared with the freedom of
the millions, and all the possibilities which that freedom grants?
And whatever may have been the sufferings, it is safe, I think, to
say that they would have been multiplied many times, had it not been
for the tireless energies of the Christian churches.

The victories of peace are more glorious than those of war, it is
said. I believe it; for they are generally more difficult to achieve.
It is easier by far to kill a man than to change his opinions. It is
easier by far to overrun a country than to root out of the hearts of
its inhabitants their long cherished hatreds and prejudices. This
requires time. This requires patience. This requires sacrifice. This
requires forbearance and love. Hence it has ever been the lot of
Christianity to follow in the track of armies, and reconquer that
which was said to be conquered. Caesar with invincible legions may
carry Roman eagles into the very heart of Britain; but the proper
subjugation of that island dates from the time when Pope Gregory the
First sent St. Augustine and forty monks to preach the gospel to
those fierce, wild, uncouth barbarians. And so, when the victorious
army of the North was passing in review before President Johnson in
the streets of Washington, another army vastly inferior in numbers,
imbued with a different spirit, and armed with no other weapons than
the Bible and the spelling book, was marching under the eye of God
down into this very field from which Grant and Sherman had but
recently withdrawn. Silently came they into the field. There was no
heralding of their approach, no display. Hopefully came they into the
field, notwithstanding they knew that to the majority of the people
their presence would be obnoxious. They came with faith in God and
love for man. They came impelled by Christian duty and patriotism to
wage a new war against the more deadly enemies of the
republic--ignorance and vice.

It is not necessary; nor is it desirable to dwell here on the state
of the South at that time. It could but present a picture dark and
confused at the best. It is not necessary to remind you here of the
bitter opposition which existed then to negro education, an
opposition which only too often manifested itself in acts of violence
and brutality. Nor need I remind you here of the hatred and contempt
that was heaped upon the so called "nigger teacher." This is history,
known and read of all men. Pleasanter by far will it be, and
certainly appropriate on this good Thanksgiving Day, to revert for a
few moments to the splendid achievements, under God, of these
faithful, Christian workers.

Their work, as we have said, was begun in confusion; but out of chaos
they have brought order, out of darkness light. Previous to the
emancipation not more than 30,000 colored persons in all these United
States could read and write. To-day, according to the statement of
Commissioner Orr, of this State, a statement verified by statistics,
fully 1,000,000 colored children are in the schools. I say, previous
to the emancipation, not more than 30,000 colored persons could read
and write. To-day, according to the last report of the society under
whose auspices I have been laboring for many years, that society
alone has given instruction to 80,000 persons, and these in turn to
tens of thousands more. This number could, of course, be greatly
swelled by the figures which could be shown by the
Congregationalists, Baptists and Presbyterians, who for these many
years have been laboring with equal patience, zeal and love, for the
advancement of mankind.

There are some, however, who think that there has not been enough
accomplished in these years, for the time, the money and the energy
spent. Well, perhaps there has not. But suppose these various
societies had accomplished, up to this time, nothing more than the
teaching of these thousands simply how to read and write, who could
estimate the value of the achievement? Who could measure the scope of
its influence and tell where that influence will end! When you have
once taught a man to read you have placed in his hands the key with
which he may--if he be industrious--unlock all the stores of
knowledge in his own language. When you have once taught a man to
read you have opened up to him unlimited possibilities, and laid the
foundations for a broad and liberal culture. When you have once
taught a man to read you have introduced him into the best society of
all the ages; you have made him the companion of Shakespeare, Milton
and Bunyan; of Bacon and of Burke; of Tennyson, Longfellow, Bryant
and Emerson; and you have quite unfitted him for slavery. When years
ago a kind mistress, in the State of Maryland, undertook to teach a
little slave boy to read, little did she think that she was awakening
aspirations never again to be quenched; little did she dream that she
was unchaining extraordinary powers, and kindling the first fires of
eloquence in the soul of a Douglass. The alphabet was made for
freemen. It is the weapon most dreaded by tyrants. When Martin Luther
would break most effectually and for all time the papal yoke from the
neck of Germany, he translated the Bible and set the people to
reading. I am thankful to-day for the pen of Lincoln and for the
sword of Grant; but more thankful by far for the patient "school
ma'am" who taught the negro his letters, and set a million of us to
reading.

INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION. III.--WHAT THE A. M. A. IS DOING.

BY SUPT. ALBERT SALISBURY.


In two previous articles (Oct. and Nov., 1884) I have set forth the
general aspects of Industrial Education and its relations to a
missionary work like that of the American Missionary Association. I
wish now to set forth, briefly, the practical possibilities and the
present undertakings of the Association in this line.

Among all the industrial schools of this continent, Hampton Institute
stands easily first in the amount of invested capital, or plant, and
in the variety and extent of its operations. It is, moreover, unique;
there is nothing else like it, and perhaps never will be, either in
its scope or in the genius which marks its administration. To give
any adequate account of the work in actual operation there would
occupy all the space at my command.

The A. M. A. can not attempt to duplicate Hampton Institute; it has
neither the means nor the man for such an undertaking.

I therefore pass to the consideration of what it is possible for us
to do on our wider field in the present and near future. The
industrial training which can be given by the A. M. A. schools is
necessarily limited, both by financial and other considerations, not
only in extent but also in variety. The ways in which we can wisely
make effort seem to be as follows: 1. _Agriculture_, which is to be,
after all, the occupation of the great majority of the people for
whom we are laboring. In this, we may well give somewhat of
theoretical instruction through lectures and even text-books; but
more important than this, and not incompatible with it, is that
effective teaching which comes by working out the practical object
lesson of a thoroughly well tilled farm, as is done at Hampton, and
to a less degree, as yet, at Tougaloo and Talladega. In this a
two-fold purpose is served. Employment is given to needy students,
and practical education is at the same time given, with but partial
interruption of the progress of intellectual training.

But the idea of running school farms simply for the first-named end,
the giving of employment to students, was long ago abandoned. Student
labor is too costly, simply as service. It must be made thoroughly
educational in order to be justified. Fortunately, the style of
farming which is most truly educational is also most nearly
remunerative. Good tools, good live stock, and good tillage are the
indispensable factors in this sort of object lesson.

2. _Wood-working_, of which the principal branch is
carpentry--turning and carving occupying a minor place. This has an
advantage over agriculture, and also over the other trades, in the
greater ease with which it may be made a matter of class instruction.
Much can be accomplished in teaching the use and care of tools
without entering at all upon processes of manufacture. Thus, classes
numbering as high as twenty or twenty-five were taught during the
past year at Atlanta University. Classes are also under instruction
at Talladega College, Tougaloo University, and Lewis Institute
(Macon). Repairs and additions to the various buildings of the
several institutions furnish opportunity for practical application of
the instruction given at the benches of the class-room; and in the
course of time some lines of manufacture may also be found
practicable, varying in kind with the locality. Along with
wood-working, instruction in glazing would seem to be feasible, and
even in that most useful art, soldering.

3. _Blacksmithing._--There are many good blacksmiths among the older
colored men; and there is no reason, except lack of opportunity for
learning, why there should not be more among the rising generation.
In school shops it is possible to teach this trade successfully to
classes. One teacher can instruct from six to ten pupils at as many
forges, but the expense is greater than in teaching the use of
wood-working tools. There is an inevitable consumption of coal and of
metal--a serious loss unless some market can be found for simple
articles of handiwork. Instruction in this branch is quite limited,
though something is being done at Tougaloo, and more at the Santee
Indian school.

Wheelwrighting is fast becoming an obsolete art in the North. The
great factories have pushed the hand-made wagon out of the market. In
the South, however, there is still much need of capable wheelwrights
for the extensive repairs necessitated by the horrible roads--or
rather lack of roads.

4. _Tinning._--This is also limited in its possibilities. A market is
necessary for the disposal of products. Even a few pupils under a
competent instructor can turn off an inconvenient amount of tin-ware,
if storage proves to be its fate rather than sale; and schools are
always at a disadvantage in the market. A fair beginning has been
made in this branch at Tougaloo University.

5. _Printing._--If I were to name yet another branch of handiwork
which it is possible to carry on as an educational accessory, it
would be "the art preservative." The experience of A. M. A.
institutions in sundry attempts hitherto is not at all of an
encouraging sort; but this is very likely because they were not
managed as educational agencies, under careful and skillful
supervision. A start under the new method is being made at Fisk
University, with many points in favor of its success.

The reader is perhaps surprised that I have not named _shoe-making_
as one of the practicable branches, since it has so often been
incorporated into the industrial organization of various reformatory
institutions; but it no longer seems a feasible undertaking for an
industrial school of the modern type. The shoe-maker's occupation is
gone, except as he becomes a part of the mechanism of a great
factory, not making _shoes_, but confining himself to the simplest
elements of a shoe, cutting uppers or scraping soles. Moreover, there
is such competition and such depression in the shoe business as make
this trade too unprofitable for prosecution in connection with school
work.

6. _Drawing._--So far, I have been considering only manual training
for boys. But there is one branch of a true industrial training which
knows no sex. It is suitable and, when rightly considered, essential
for boys and girls alike. While visiting the St. Louis Manual
Training School two years ago, I said to Prof. Woodward, "What can we
of the missionary schools, with our financial limitations, do best in
this line of manual training?" He answered, "There is one thing that
you can do in any school: it costs little, needs no special
appliances or plant, and is the fundamental part of any industrial
training, _drawing_." And he was right so far as the utility of the
study is concerned. Drawing, not as a matter of picture-making, but
as a means of systematic training for eye and hand, a training to
accuracy and method, and as a vital help toward foremanship in any
trade, ought everywhere to be held as a necessary element of
industrial education. Some beginning in industrial drawing has been
made in all our institutions. But, in a work like ours, the lack of
special preparation on the part of most teachers, their insufficient
appreciation of and faith in the study, and the lack of close direct
supervision, are serious hindrances to complete success.

The range of industrial work for girls is less wide than that for
boys, and lies chiefly in the zone of home making and keeping.

1. _Sewing_ is the first subject of instruction. The generation of
women who came out of slavery knew nothing, and still know nothing,
of needle-work. And so in all our schools, even the day schools,
classes in plain sewing have long found a place; though of late the
work has been taken up more systematically, all the girls of certain
grades being held to the sewing classes as strictly as to reading or
writing. After plain sewing comes the cutting and making of garments,
the various forms of seductive "fancy work" being almost wholly
ignored.

In our exhibit at the Madison meeting of the National Educational
Association last summer were numbers of aprons, dresses, shirts,
etc., made by pupils, often of the primary grades; and one of the
most noticed specimens was a neatly darned stocking. Even darning
must be taught to these girls in school; there is no instructor at
home.

2. _Cooking_ is much more widely understood by the colored mothers.
Indeed, there is a sort of illusory tradition abroad that the negroes
are a race of cooks; though, according to my observation, nothing
could be farther from the truth. And cooking is only one part of
_domestic economy_. Of this art as a whole, the colored women are
densely ignorant. They know nothing of orderly housekeeping, of
marketing, or of economy in any true sense of the word.

In several of our schools--notably Le Moyne Institute at
Memphis--instruction in domestic economy, including cooking, is now
well systematized as a part of the course of study for girls. At
Atlanta University, a class of young women each year is inducted into
a full and careful knowledge of good housekeeping by what is called
the cottage plan, the girls doing their own housekeeping through the
year under the training of a cultivated house-mother.

Nor should it be forgotten that in every boarding school of the A. M.
A. the regular ongoing of the domestic work of the institution,
nearly all of which except the cooking and washing is done by the
students, furnishes no insignificant or ineffectual training in the
art of housekeeping.

8. _Nursing_ and the general care of the sick is also a branch in
which instruction and training are sadly needed by the colored women.
Few things are more pitiful than the condition of the sick among any
half-civilized people, with their caprices, their superstitions and
their irregularities. In this direction, Fisk University takes a
prominent place among our institutions, employing a professionally
trained woman who gives her whole time to the hygiene of the school
and the training of the students in health-preserving and
health-restoring.

It would have been easy to double the length of this article by going
more into details with respect to the industrial features in process
of incorporation into the work of all our leading institutions, and
their industrial influence, the "unconscious tuition" of industry
which they have come more and more to exert. Suffice it to add,
without hyperbole, that it is easy to _track_ these missionary
schools, to trace their influence by their results upon the home life
and domestic ambitions of the young people who have gone out from
them to the work of the world. And this influence is yet in its
beginnings.

       *       *       *       *       *

THE OUTLOOK.

REV. W. C. POND.


With the beginning of a new fiscal year there came to me a deep sense
of dissatisfaction with the present status of our work--a sadness
which almost touched the borders of discouragement at the decrease in
attendance on our schools, and the lack of eager outreaching and
aggressive endeavor on the part of us all--Superintendent, Teachers
and Chinese helpers,--all alike. The methods, which had been so
strikingly efficient in years past, seemed to be failing us now. We
were settled down into them, as ruts; and, no matter how slow or hard
or fruitless our movements along the old line, it seemed impossible
to see what else to do, or how we could strike out into new paths, or
plan any material change in the ordering of our campaign.

Sometimes the question would arise; Is our work done? Has the
Restriction Act, which for the present diminishes so greatly the
incoming of fresh recruits for our schools, rung the knell of our
missionary success? But to this question only one answer was
possible. Even if, looking out from a stand-point of consummate
Calvinism, we should venture to decide that the Lord's elect among
the Chinese in California had all been gathered in, there were,
nevertheless, these little flocks of Christ's own sheep and lambs
already gathered that must not be left without a shepherd's care.
Surely there is a duty that we owe to these, and to leave them
untended in this wilderness would be to count ourselves in among the
goats on the left hand of the Judge.

But no Calvinism of any sort--and certainly not of our sort--gives us
any basis for such an unchristian decision. We cannot shelter behind
it, and think to retire with honor when we have as yet only
skirmished on the edges of the field. For the Chinese heathenism of
California remains to-day, so far as we can see, substantially a
solid mass, without any fissure, though not without a scar. Many
chips have been struck off from it, and for these we bless God; but
the rock-like hardness of the Chinese heart remains substantially
unbroken. Say that all our missions have reached, in the aggregate,
5,000 of these souls--there remain 65,000 virtually untouched.
Suppose that we could count 1,000 born of God in all the missions
(and this would be a large estimate) there remain 69,000 that are
still aliens from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers to the
covenants of promise, without God and without hope in the world. To
penetrate, somehow, this Chinese wall of prejudice, conceit and
superstition, and pierce, with the sword of the spirit, the hearts
intrenched behind it--to reach, somehow, the myriads not reached, and
to bring them forth from the darkness that they love into the saving
light that now they hate--this was the problem. You can look at it. I
_have_ looked at it--till the sense of helplessness and uselessness
threw me down upon my knees with my heart next door to despair. But
there the still small voice was heard again, the voice of an
_infinite_ Saviour saying, "Be not afraid, only believe." "If ye have
faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say even to _this_
mountain, Remove hence, and it _shall remove_."

But with fresh courage, born of faith, came a conviction that some
change of method,--not as abandoning by any means our schools, but as
introducing new methods, breaking in upon an old and worn routine,
was indispensable. What it should be I could not tell. One could
conceive of several plans of operation, which would be beyond our
reach for lack of means, but to find the work and then the workers,
and still keep inside the line of safe expenditure--this called for a
wisdom which could come to _me_, at any rate, only from above. We
have been seeking this guidance. I say, "we," for I believe that
teachers and helpers have prayed with me for it. We expect it to
come. We venture to hope that we see it coming.

One token is the opening of new fields, especially at San Diego and
Tulare--experiments yet, but hopeful ones. Another token is that in
one, at least, of our helpers evangelistic power seems to appear. Not
without anxiety did I see him brought within the fascination of the
"Holiness Band" and the "Salvation Army," and my fears were not
groundless, as some minor symptoms in his spiritual life clearly
disclosed. But I believe that his Master and ours knew what was going
on and will bring him forth out of it all, unscathed and better
fitted for high service than he has ever been hitherto. At present
he is in Oroville. After being there less than a week he wrote, "God
has given me three souls--one of them at the meeting last night." And
later, Rev. Joseph Adams, pastor of our church there, wrote as
follows: "There is a very blessed work going on among the Chinese
here. After conference with Wong Ock I invited him to bring to my
house all the boys he thought were Christians. I fixed an evening
about ten days ago, and invited my church clerk and Dr. Read to be
present. Wong Ock came with eight boys. We were occupied with them
until nearly midnight. It was one of the most blessed meetings I have
had in this county. I examined them, through Wong Ock, as
interpreter, in relation to their conversion, how it was brought
about, and what was their present experience. Two professed to find
peace with God during the meeting. Their child-like faith and ready
acceptance of the statements and promises of the gospel were simply
delightful. Considering their former training, and the small
advantages of Christian knowledge, it was truly wonderful. My
brethren agreed with me, that beyond all dispute they exhibited a
glorious work of the spirit of God."

[Illustration: Class of Chinese girls]

A third token of approaching answers to our prayer I see in the
coming among us of Rev. D. D. Jones, who has been connected with our
South China Mission, under Rev. C. R. Hager of Hong Kong. The French
war has so disturbed the people among whom he was laboring, and, for
the present, so closed the doors to missionary service, that he has
seized the opportunity for a visit to us. He is well fitted for
street preaching, and seems to have the evangelistic spirit. By way
of experiment I have asked him to labor with us in this city for a
month or two--hoping, if the Lord accepts our endeavor, to have him
visit Sacramento, Marysville and other points. The beginnings of his
work are encouraging, and we venture to hope that fruit already
appears. We ask the readers of the _Missionary_ to add their requests
to ours, that these tokens may be what the cloud was, big as a man's
hand--precursor of glad out-pourings such as those in which Elijah
left the mount of conflict and of prayer.

LETTER FROM AN INDIAN BOY.


The letter given below was written by a Sioux Indian boy, whose
entire education has been gained in the three years he has now been
at Hampton Institute. It was written in acknowledgment of a Christmas
gift of ten dollars for the purchase of books for himself, sent by a
Sabbath-school class of boys in New York city.


     HAMPTON, Va. Dec. 18th, 1884.

     DEAR FRIENDS: It is impossible for me to write a few lines. I am
     glad that I will try to say a few words Of my people. We were
     just like a little baby. When Columbus discovered America, Until
     now To-day, we are different from what we were at that time. It
     is hard for us to leave our own old Indian ways at once. You
     know how hard it is for a crazy man get better from his crazy.
     It is just so with the Indians, it is hard for us. When I was at
     home, I was the youngest, But I try to do my best. So my parents
     wanted me to be kept there, As long as I could. But some of my
     friends think it will better for me to get a little education,
     and them some more to help them. It seem to me come to schools,
     And now I am school in this institution, and it is hard for me
     to do right. But I try to do my best as well as possible. And I
     learn little bits of English language or composition and also
     some history, Ever since I been here about over three years ago.
     So I am anxious to tell you something about my people, but as I
     say I have been here three years, I did not know how they
     getting along--But I think they are become like as civilized
     now, As some of them try very hard to do as the white people's.
     But there are some white men in our agencies, are good but only
     few of them, And there are most of all bad ones. Those bad ones
     who are try hard to pull us down. So hoping you will help and
     pray for us. We may stand against these bad temptation. And
     finally we shall be risen very slowly, from the lowest to the
     highest civilization. Some of the white man those who opposed
     the Indian they said--"The Indians can never be civilized are
     dead Indian not lives Indians but dead, them are unsuccessful
     and good for anything." It may be very true. But if some always
     good people will help us to do right, We shall be civilized as
     well as any other nation. my friends I wish I could do more, but
     the language which I am using is rather and difficult for me and
     keeps me back. Therefore I cannot express of my desire but as I
     say again We shall not be civilized at once, but we shall in the
     future. I thank you for money very much.

     I am most sincerely an Indian friend.


     BENJ. OHITIKA.


The attempt of the writer of the letter to quote the inhuman
sentiment so often uttered by bad white men: "There is no good Indian
but a dead Indian," illustrates the extreme difficulty an Indian has
in acquiring our language. The penmanship of this boy would bear
favorable comparison with that of young men of his age as they
graduate from our public schools. It is an interesting fact that the
Indian under education uniformly excels in penmanship.

The Independent,

No. 251 Broadway, New York.

    "One of the ablest weeklies in existence."--_Pall Mall Gazette,
    London._

In its thirty-sixth year of publication THE INDEPENDENT stands easily
at the head of religious and literary weekly newspapers wherever
published. Being undenominational, it has the opportunity offered it
to present to its readers discussions upon all religious questions,
many clergymen and laymen seeking its pages for a freer and fuller
discussion than any denominational paper will grant. Having
thirty-two folio pages, it has space to give all the important
religious intelligence; and to aid it in doing so, it has paid corps
of correspondents scattered all over the world. The matter of expense
is not considered in its aim to give its readers the most valuable
discussions and most trustworthy facts by the ablest and most popular
writers.

For thirty years past the design of THE INDEPENDENT has been to
publish the ablest and best family paper in the world, and it now
occupies that position. Aside from the religious element of THE
INDEPENDENT, its literary attractiveness is unequaled. A glance at
the names of our general contributors, which will be sent to any
address upon application, will convince any one that the literary
merit of THE INDEPENDENT is of the first class. Its department
devoted to book reviews is probably better and fuller than can be
found in this country, and is only equaled by that of the _Academy_
and _Athenaeum_ of London.

It has altogether twenty-two different departments, nearly all of
which are edited by or contributed to by specialists. These
departments are: Editorials, Fine Arts, Music, Science, Religious
Intelligence, Missions, School and College, News of the Week, Hymn
Notes, the Sunday-school, Legal, Sanitary, Pebbles, Biblical
Research, Farm and Garden, Insurance, Weekly Market Reports,
Financial and Commercial, Dry Goods, Dry Goods Quotations,
Personalities.

THE INDEPENDENT has thirty-two pages; the other weeklies have from
twelve to, not over, twenty-four. At $3.00 per year--its subscription
price--THE INDEPENDENT costs about six cents per week, which almost
any person or family in the United States can well afford for a paper
which gives them such wonderful returns. The cost each week for
contributed articles alone ranges from $250.00 to $800.00, which is
probably two or three times as great as that expended by any similar
weekly religious paper in the country.

THE INDEPENDENT rigidly excludes from its advertising columns
advertisements of a doubtful character, or any by which, in the
opinion of its managers, subscribers might not receive an equivalent
for their money. In consequence, its advertising columns are sought
after by the very best class of advertisers, to the satisfaction both
of the advertiser and subscriber.

THE INDEPENDENT ought, because of its merit alone, to be taken by at
least 100,000 more people than now subscribe for it, and if any
person who sees this advertisement would like to make its
acquaintance, he can do so by sending a postal-card request for a
free specimen copy; or, if he prefers, he can subscribe for any
length of time from one month up to five years, as per rates below.

During the past year THE INDEPENDENT, desiring that its subscribers
should have stories by the very best living authors, has published
contributions from W. E. Norris, author of "Matrimony," "No New
Thing," etc.; J. S. of Dale, author of "Guerndale," "The Crime of
Henry Vane," etc.: Julia Schayer, author of "Tiger Lily and Other
Stories"; Sir Samuel W. Baker, the Celebrated Egyptian Explorer; Mrs.
J. H. Riddell, author of "The Senior Partner," etc.; Thomas Hardy,
author of "A Pair of Blue Eyes," "Two on a Tower," etc.; Edward
Everett Hale, author of "Ten Times One is Ten," etc.; James Payn, the
celebrated English novelist; Lucy C. Lillie, F. W. Robinson, Fred. D.
Storey, Henry W. Lucy, Harriet Prescott Spofford, Rebecca Harding
Davis, Sarah Orne Jewett, Frank R. Stockton, H. H. Boyesen, Ivan
Tourgeneff, and others.

The same general policy of providing original stories by the foremost
living authors will be maintained.

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
