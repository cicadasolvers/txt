Morphological Variation in a Population of the Snake, Tantilla gracilis
Baird and Girard

By

LAURENCE M. HARDY AND CHARLES J. COLE




INTRODUCTION


Variation of selected taxonomic characteristics of flat-headed snakes
(_Tantilla gracilis_ Baird and Girard) from several midwestern states
was studied by Force (1935), but she did not attempt a comprehensive
evaluation. Taylor (1936) reported on variation in _T. gracilis_ from
various localities in Kansas; Kirn, Burger, and Smith (1949) studied
selected structures of specimens of _T. gracilis_ from throughout its
range. The present study was undertaken to determine the variation in
both currently used and potential taxonomic characteristics of _T.
gracilis_ from one locality.

We are thankful to Charles W. Myers, Gorgas Memorial Laboratory, for
suggestions concerning characteristics examined. We are indebted to Drs.
William G. Degenhardt, University of New Mexico, Herndon G. Dowling, New
York Zoological Society, Charles H. Lowe, University of Arizona, and
Richard G. Zweifel, American Museum of Natural History, for criticizing
the manuscript. Dr. William E. Duellman permitted us to study specimens
in the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History.


Materials and Methods

The specimens examined were donated to the Museum of Natural History,
University of Kansas, by the late Paul Anderson of Independence,
Missouri. All specimens (KU numbers 83435-83680; N = 246) were collected
in the vicinity of Winfield, Cowley County, Kansas, by Charles E. Burt
and students from Southwestern College in the period from 1938 to 1941,
inclusive.

Both authors gathered data on most characteristics and examined each
atypical individual. Hardy determined characters of the maxillae (which
were removed; N = 20), body and total lengths, and the scale formula of
KU 83620.

We examined 22 characteristics of external morphology and 10 of the
maxillae. All paired characteristics (excepting those of the maxillae)
were examined on both sides of each snake and are referred to from the
left side to the right side (for example, "preoculars 1-2" means there
is one preocular on the left side and there are two on the right).
Oviducts and oviducal eggs were observed on specimens designated as
females; hemipenes were examined on specimens designated as males. Total
length was measured by straightening each snake along a 300 mm. scale.
Tail length was measured only on snakes having complete tails, and body
length (snout-vent) was considered as total length minus tail length.
The body length was measured on snakes having incomplete tails.

Supralabials, infralabials, preoculars and postoculars were counted, and
we followed Peters (1960:9) in determining the nature of the temporals.
Occasionally the primary (anterior) temporal is separated from the
postocular by contact of the parietal and a supralabial (Taylor,
1936:338). We followed Peters (1964:219-220) in determining
characteristics of the nasal and we looked for contact of the prefrontal
with particular supralabials (Taylor, 1936:338). We determined which
supralabials are in contact with the eye and whether the mental is in
contact with the anterior pair of chin-shields.

The number of rows of dorsal scales was determined at five locations: a)
around the neck--counts were made from each side diagonally and
posteriorly from the anteriormost dorsal scale in contact with the first
ventral (see below)--counts from the left and right sides are the first
and second counts, respectively, recorded in the scale formula; b) one
head length posterior to head--counts were made either diagonally and
posteriorly or in a zig-zag pattern, beginning at the end of the second
count around the neck--this is the third count recorded in the scale
formula; c) midbody (approximated)--counts were made either diagonally
and posteriorly or in a zig-zag pattern--this is the fourth count in the
scale formula; d) anterior to anus (preanal)--counts were made in a
zig-zag pattern beginning on one side and ending on the other at the
first dorsal scale in contact with the anal plate--this is the fifth
count in the scale formula.

We followed the method of Dowling (1951:98-99) in counting ventrals, and
the anal plate was determined as entire, divided, or partly divided.
Subcaudals were counted on only the right side beginning at the first
scale that contacts a corresponding scale from the opposite side; fusion
of particular pairs of subcaudals was determined. The "spine" at the tip
of the tail was not counted. The head scutellation of each specimen was
examined for abnormalities.

We determined the number of fangs and the number of maxillary teeth
anterior to them and recorded the presence or absence of a diastema
between the anterior fang and the maxillary tooth immediately preceding
it. The diastema, if present, is a space distinctly wider than the
spaces separating the prediastemal teeth.

The point of intersection of two perpendicular lines of an ocular grid
determined which tooth-socket occurs directly opposite the distal tip of
the suborbital process (Fig. 5b), but if that point occurs between two
sockets then the number recorded was the number of the tooth immediately
anterior to that point plus one-half.

The anterior and posterior edges of the suborbital process were
determined as parallel or not at any point by aligning them with
parallel lines on an ocular grid (Fig. 5b).

The angle of the posterior edge of the lateral flange was determined as
an acute, obtuse, or right angle by fitting it to a pair of
perpendicular lines of an ocular grid (Fig. 5b).

The number of lateral anterior foramina (Fig. 4b) was determined. If
only two are present, their lengths (anterior to posterior) were
compared by measuring them with an ocular micrometer. Also, if two
lateral anterior foramina are present, the point of intersection of two
perpendicular lines of an ocular grid determined which tooth-socket
occurs directly below the center of the posterior foramen (Fig. 4b).




RESULTS


General Characteristics

From the data given by Force (1935), Taylor (1936), and Kirn _et al._
(1949), and from our own data, we conclude that a typical specimen of
_gracilis_, meaning a specimen having the usual characteristics of the
species, has the following characteristics in combination: supralabials
6-6; infralabials 6-6; preoculars 1-1; postoculars 1-1; temporals 1 + 1
on each side; nasal divided below naris; supralabials 3 + 4 entering
orbit; mental in contact with chin-shields; all five dorsal scale counts
15; and plate divided. (In the present work we use the words usual,
unusual, typical, and atypical with neither quotation marks nor
apology).

Of the 244 specimens on which we could examine each of these
characteristics, only 125 (51.2%) have all of the typical
characteristics in combination. The 119 specimens that do not possess
all of the typical characteristics in combination include 31 (12.7% of
the 244) that lack at least two of the typical characteristics.


Sex

The sample (N = 246) is composed of 107 (43.5%) females and 139 (56.5%)
males.


Measurements

Females have total lengths from 96 to 244 mm. (mean, 173.3; N = 79). One
female (KU 83480) measuring 244 mm. may be the longest specimen known
(Conant, 1958, reports the longest as 9-1/8 inches--approximately 232
mm.). Males have total lengths from 96 to 215 mm. (mean, 162.4; N =
109). Females have tail lengths from 16 to 50 mm. (mean, 34.6; N = 79),
and males have tail lengths from 21 to 53 mm. (mean, 37.8; N = 109).

The ratio of tail length to total length in females is from 0.17 to 0.22
(mean, 0.20; N = 79); in males it is from 0.21 to 0.27 (mean, 0.23; N =
109; Fig. 1). Juveniles (those less than 125 mm. in total length
according to Force, 1935: tables 1 and 2) have proportionally shorter
tails than do adults; the ratio of tail length divided by total length
is 0.17-0.21 (mean, 0.18; N = 14) in females and 0.21-0.23 (mean, 0.22;
N = 16) in males. Adult females (125 mm. or more in total length) have
ratios from 0.18 to 0.22 (mean, 0.20; N = 65) and adult males have
ratios from 0.21 to 0.27 (mean, 0.23; N = 93).

[Illustration: FIG. 1. Ratio of tail length to total length in females
and males of _T. gracilis_.]

Of the 246 specimens examined, 58 have incomplete tails. Of these 58
specimens, six had freshly broken tails, so we assume that 52 (21.1% of
the 246) have incomplete tails resulting from natural causes; the
remaining six specimens could have had their tails broken at or soon
after capture, assuming that none of the snakes was retained in
captivity for an extended period.


Supralabials

The supralabials are either six (usually) or seven on a side (Table 1).
When seven supralabials are present on either one or both sides, the
addition results from one of the following conditions: a) 5 is divided
to form 5 and 6 (N = 6); b) 2 and 3 form 2, 3, and 4 (N = 1); c) 5 and 6
form 5, 6, and 7 (N = 12); d) 4, 5, and 6 form 4, 5, 6, and 7 (N = 1);
e) 1 and 2 form 1, 2, and 3 (N = 1); f) 1, 2, and 3 form 1, 2, 3, and 4
(N = 1); g) 2 is fused with the nasal, and 3 and 4 are reduced to
granules (N = 1); h) type of addition unknown (N = 5).

        6-7   |     10   |    4.1    |     5-6    |    4    |   1.6
        7-6   |     10   |    4.1    |     6-5    |    5    |   2.0
        7-7   |      4   |    1.6    |     6-6    |  229    |  93.1

              |          |           |     7-6    |    2    |   0.8
  ------------+----------+-----------+------------+---------+----------

In three of the four specimens with 7-7 supralabials, the type of
addition is the same on each side, whereas the other specimen has a
different type of addition on each side. Of the 23 examples for which
the type of addition is known, 19 (82.6%) have the increase in number on
the posterior half of the series.

In one specimen the third supralabial on the right is diagonally divided
and the resulting upper part does not contact the edge of the lip; hence
the specimen has 6-6 supralabials.


Infralabials

The infralabials are five, six (usually), or seven on a side (Table 1).
When five infralabials are present on either one or both sides, the
reduction results from one of the following conditions: a) 2 and 3 are
fused (N = 3); b) 1, 2, and 3 form 1 and 2 (N = 6); c) 2, 3, and 4 form
2 and 3 (N = 3); d) 5 is separated from the edge of the lip by a
projection from an adjacent infralabial (N = 1); e) 1, 2, 3, and 4 form
1, 2, and 3 (N = 2); f) type of reduction unknown (N = 4).

Of the specimens with 5-5 infralabials, two have the same type of
reduction on each side, one has a different type of reduction on each
side, and the type of reduction is unknown for the other two specimens.

When seven infralabials are present on either one or both sides, the
addition can result from infralabials 2 and 3 forming 2, 3, and 4 (N =
2); the type of addition is unknown in one specimen.

In one specimen the second infralabial on the right side is reduced to a
small wedge-shaped granule and in another specimen several infralabials
on both sides are irregularly divided horizontally, although both
specimens have six infralabials on the sides having the abnormalities.


Preoculars

Of the 245 specimens examined, 242 (98.8%) have one preocular on each
side. Both preoculars are absent from two specimens, and one specimen
has 1-0. In each case when a preocular is lacking, the "preocular" and
prefrontal are fused. One specimen having 1-1 preoculars has both of
them reduced to small vertical slivers.


Postoculars

Of the 245 specimens examined, 242 (98.8%) have one postocular on each
side. Postoculars are 2-1 in two specimens and 1-2 in one. In one
specimen the lower of the two postoculars on each side is very small,
being approximately 1/6 the diameter of the upper one (measured with an
ocular micrometer).


Temporals

Of the 245 specimens examined, 235 (95.9%) have 1 + 1 temporals on each
side. Four specimens exhibit addition of temporals: one specimen has two
secondary temporals on the left, and one has a tertiary temporal on the
left. Two specimens have partly healed head injuries that probably
caused atypical temporal conditions: one specimen has two primary
temporals on the left, and one has two secondary temporals on the left
and two upper and one lower secondary temporal on the right.

Six specimens exhibit reduction of temporals: one lacks a primary
temporal on the left ("temporal" is fused with sixth supralabial), two
lack secondary temporals on the right, and three lack secondary
temporals on the left. The right secondary "temporal" of one specimen is
separated from the supralabials by a posterior extension of the primary
temporal.

Of the 246 specimens examined, 200 (81.3%) have both primary temporals
in contact with their adjacent postoculars. Thirteen specimens (5.3%)
have only the left primary temporal in contact with the postocular and
eight (3.3%) have only the right primary temporal in contact with the
postocular. Twenty-five specimens (10.2%) have both primary temporals
separated from the postoculars. Separation of the primary temporal from
the postocular, whenever it occurs, results from contact of mutual
extensions from the adjacent parietal and supralabial (usually the
fifth).


Nasal

Of the 243 specimens examined, 237 (97.5%) have the nasal divided below
the naris on both sides. Three specimens have the nasal completely
divided (above and below the naris) on only the left side; one specimen
has a completely divided nasal on only the right side. A groove, but not
a complete division of the nasal, is present above the left naris of one
specimen. One specimen lacks the typical division below the naris on
both sides, but a complete suture is present posterior to the naris and
the resulting postnasal scales are, according to position, loreals.


Contact of prefrontal with supralabials

Of the 243 specimens examined, 147 (60.5%) have the prefrontal separated
from the labials on each side. Of the remaining 96 specimens, 53 (21.8%
of the 243) have the prefrontals in contact with the second labial on
each side; five other variations of this characteristic were observed
(Table 2).

  ----------------------------------------------------+---------+----------

The specimen having the prefrontal in contact with labial 2 on the left
and labial 3 on the right has seven supralabials on the right, the extra
labial being added anterior to the eye. In two of the three specimens
with the prefrontals in contact with labial 3 on the left and labial 2
on the right, the preoculars and prefrontals are fused on each side; the
third specimen has each preocular reduced to a small vertical sliver. Of
the three specimens having the prefrontals in contact with labial 2 on
the left and labials 2 and 3 on the right, two are typical with respect
to other characteristics that might result in this atypical condition,
but one has the prefrontals and preoculars fused.


Supralabials entering orbit

Of the 246 specimens examined, 233 (94.7%) have the third and fourth
supralabials entering each eye (Table 3). All snakes that have the
fourth and fifth labials entering the orbit on either side also have
seven supralabials on the same side. One specimen having only the fourth
labial entering the eye on the right side also has six supralabials on
that side, but the third supralabial is split diagonally and the part
contacting the eye does not contact the lip and hence is not a
supralabial. The remaining three atypical conditions (4/3 + 4; 3 + 4/3 +
4 + 5; 3 + 4 + 5/3 + 4) occur only one time each and on snakes having
6-6 supralabials.


Contact of mental with chin-shields

Of the 246 specimens examined, 190 (77.2%) have the mental in contact
with both anterior chin-shields. The mental is in contact with only the
left anterior chin-shield in 15 specimens, only the right anterior
chin-shield in 2 specimens, and the mental does not contact either
anterior chin-shield in 39 specimens. Separation of the mental and an
anterior chin-shield always results from the posterior elongation of a
first infralabial.

Dorsal scale rows

Of the 245 specimens examined for this characteristic, 228 (92.7%) have
scale counts of 15-15-15-15-15. The number of scale rows around the neck
and one head length behind the head are 15 except in a single specimen
that has 14 scale rows at these three places. The number of scale rows
around midbody is 15 in 244 of 246 specimens (99.2%); two specimens have
14 scale rows around midbody. The number of preanal scale rows is more
variable; counts of 14 through 17 were recorded. Fourteen specimens have
14 preanal scale rows (5.7%), 229 have 15 preanal rows (93.1%), two have
16 preanal rows (0.8%), and one has 17 preanal rows (0.4%). Known causes
for atypical numbers of preanal scale rows are listed in Table 4. A
preanal count at one head length anterior to the anus would have omitted
most of the above variation in numbers of preanal scale rows.

Specimen 83620 is the only one for which we have determined the complete
dorsal scale formula. Obviously the formula is complex, and possibly the
specimen is atypical in this regard. Nevertheless, addition and
reduction of scale rows is apparent on other specimens and can be easily
observed by examining specimens under a dissection microscope.


Anal plate

Of the 246 specimens examined, 232 (94.3%) have the anal plate divided.
Of the 14 specimens having undivided anal plates, four have an
incomplete groove anteriorly in the plate.


Ventrals

[Illustration: FIG. 2. Number of ventrals in females and males of _T.
gracilis_.]

Females have from 122 to 137 (mean, 130.8 +- 0.26; N = 107) ventrals;
males have from 117 to 131 (mean, 122.3 +- 0.21; N = 139; Fig. 2). Of the
246 specimens examined, 29 (11.8%; 11 females and 18 males) have an
added half-ventral immediately anterior to the anal plate. Of these
specimens, 27 have the added half-ventral on the left side and two have
it on the right. Five specimens have the last ventral divided similar to
the normal division of the anal plate. One specimen has the last ventral
incompletely divided transversely. Excluding the last ventral, seven
specimens have divided ventrals (half-ventrals). Four of these specimens
have added half-ventrals on the right side (two specimens with one
half-ventral each, one specimen with two half-ventrals, and one specimen
with three half-ventrals), and four have added half-ventrals on the left
side (one half-ventral on each specimen).


Subcaudals

Females have from 37 to 47 (mean, 42.0 +- 0.20; N = 79) subcaudals; males
have from 43 to 55 (mean, 48.4 +- 0.23; N = 109; Fig. 3). Of the 187
specimens examined, 13 (7.0%) have the last pair of subcaudals fused.
One specimen has left subcaudal 28 fused with both adjacent subcaudals
(also fused) on the right. While reading proof we found two omissions in
Fig. 3; there should be illustrated two males with 43 subcaudals and
three males with 44 subcaudals.

[Illustration: FIG. 3. Number of subcaudals in females and males of _T.
gracilis_.]


Ventrals minus subcaudals

The value for number of ventrals minus the number of subcaudals varies
from 80 to 96 (mean, 88.8 +- 0.39) for 79 females, and from 67 to 83
(mean, 73.8 +- 0.28) for 109 males.


Additional scale characteristics

Of the 246 specimens examined, four (1.6%) have the rostral in contact
with the left prefrontal, and hence the internasals are separated from
one another. One snake has approximately one-fourth (anteriorly) of the
suture between the parietals fused. One specimen has the posterior edge
of the frontal fused with the left parietal. One specimen has the
parietal shield on the right side abbreviated posteriorly. One specimen
has both prefrontals fused with the frontal, although an incomplete
suture is present.


Maxillary characteristics (_Figs. 4 and 5_)

Maxillary teeth anterior to fangs 10-14 (mean, 12.1; N = 20);
tooth-socket number 6.5-8.5 (mean, 7.2; N = 20) directly opposite distal
tip of suborbital process; lateral anterior foramina 1-3 (mean, 1.8; N =
20); tooth number 6-9 (mean, 6.9; N = 12) directly below center of
posterior foramen (if only two foramina present). Three specimens lack a
diastema and 17 specimens have a diastema. The anterior and posterior
edges of the suborbital process are parallel in two specimens and not
parallel in 14; the process is broken in four specimens. The lengths
(anterior to posterior) of the lateral anterior foramina (if only two
are present) are approximately equal in six specimens, and in six the
anteriormost one is the longest; six specimens have one foramen and two
specimens have three foramina. All specimens examined have two fangs,
with the posterior edge of the lateral flange forming an obtuse angle.

(KU 83484), x 39. Actual length of bone is 2.44 mm. A. Detail of bone.
B. Outline sketch of bone to illustrate characteristics examined.
Lateral anterior foramina (LF); fangs (F); "prediastemal" maxillary
teeth (MT); lateral flange (PLF); perpendicular lines, A-B and C-D, are
used to determine which tooth-socket occurs directly below the center of
the posterior foramen (the specimen illustrated is atypical because
there are three foramina present).]


Discussion and Conclusions

Generic characteristics of _Tantilla_ are as follows: size small, body
slender, head not noticeably distinct from body; preoculars one;
postoculars one or two; nasals two; loreal absent; smooth dorsal scales
in 15 rows; anal plate usually divided but sometimes single; subcaudals
paired; usually two enlarged, posterior, grooved fangs on the maxilla
separated by a small diastema from the other maxillary teeth (Baird and
Girard, 1853:131; Cope, 1900:1110; Dunn, 1928:24; Blanchard, 1938:369;
Schmidt and Davis, 1941:268; Wright and Wright, 1957:722; Conant,
1958:180). Of these characteristics, only the following were invariable
in our sample: size small, body slender, head not noticeably distinct
from body; postoculars one or two; smooth dorsal scales; posterior
grooved fangs on maxilla. The dorsal scales, anal, and subcaudals were
"correct" 92 per cent of the time; the preoculars and nasals were
"correct" 97 per cent of the time.

(KU 83484), x 39. Actual length of bone is 2.44 mm. A. Detail of bone.
B. Outline sketch of bone to illustrate characteristics examined.
Lateral flange (PLF) forms an obtuse angle (ADC) with main axis of bone
(AB); a reference line (2), perpendicular to the main axis of the bone,
is used to locate the tooth-socket directly opposite the tip of the
suborbital process (SOP); the anterior and posterior edges of the
suborbital process are not parallel at any point (reference lines 1 and
3).]

_Tantilla_ reportedly has two nasals (Baird and Girard, 1853:131; Cope,
1900:1110; Wright and Wright, 1957:722). _Tantilla gracilis_ usually has
a single nasal that is divided below the naris; variation in this
characteristic is discussed above.

In addition to the generic characteristics, specific characteristics for
_T. gracilis_ are as follows: supralabials 5-8 (usually 6); supralabials
3 and 4 entering orbit; infralabials 5-7 (usually 6); temporals 1 + 1;
ventrals 115-138 in females, 106-132 in males; subcaudals 33-53 in
females, 40-57 in males; tail length 13-27 per cent total length in
females, 15-30 per cent in males (Baird and Girard, 1853:132; Cope,
1900:1111-12; Force, 1935:653-54; Taylor, 1936:337-38; Blanchard,
1938:371-72; Kirn, Burger, and Smith, 1949:240-49). Excepting the number
of temporals and the supralabials entering the orbit, the
characteristics of the specimens in our sample are within the ranges of
variation mentioned above. Of the 10 maxillary characteristics studied,
no variation was observed in number of fangs or angle of lateral flange.

Because our data have some bearing on the problem of geographic
variation in _T. gracilis_ and the recognition of subspecies, we comment
briefly on the status of subspecies in _T. gracilis_. Kirn, Burger and
Smith (1949) proposed the recognition of two subspecies of _Tantilla
gracilis_ (_T. g. gracilis_ Baird and Girard and _T. g. hallowelli_
Cope). These subspecies were diagnosed on the basis of differences in
ventrals, subcaudals, and the ratio of tail length to total length;
sexual dimorphism in each characteristic was considered. We do not
recognize these subspecies for the reasons given below.

The data of Kirn _et al._ (1949) appear to be presented inaccurately in
part. Both of us independently recalculated the mean given for each
characteristic for each subspecies, using the data in figures 2-4 of
Kirn _et al._ (1949:242, 244-245). Of their 12 means presented (table 1,
p. 247) only two agree with our recalculated means, although the means
calculated by each of us independently are in complete agreement (Table
5). Also, we independently calculated the percentages of specimens of
each "subspecies" that are included in the ranges of variation given in
their diagnoses (Table 5); again, our independent calculations are in
complete agreement. In our opinion the differences between the
populations for the characteristics analyzed do not warrant recognition
of subspecies (Fig. 6).

The data presented by Kirn _et al._ do not demonstrate intergradation
between two populations. Moreover, the diagnostic ranges of the number
of subcaudals in males of _hallowelli_ and the ratio of tail length to
total length in males of _gracilis_ do not include the recalculated
means for those characteristics. Furthermore, the means for the
following characteristics are dangerously close to being excluded from
their respective "diagnostic" ranges: in _hallowelli_, the number of
ventrals in males; in _gracilis_, the number of subcaudals in females,
and the ratio of tail length to total length in females. It is
incongruous that Kirn _et al._ state (p. 243) that "the coefficient of
geographic divergence is .6 per degree latitude" for ventrals, and on
the same page they state that "The average number of ventrals gradually
increases toward the north in _Tantilla gracilis_ except in southern
Oklahoma and central Arkansas (the area of intergradation between _T. g.
gracilis_ and _T. g. hallowelli_) where the change seems to be more
abrupt." The data presented in Kirn _et al._ (1949) do not demonstrate
an abrupt change.

The present sample of _T. gracilis_ from Kansas is clearly within the
geographic range of _T. g. hallowelli_ as mapped by Kirn _et al._
(1949:241). However, for the sample from Kansas, the mean number of
subcaudals of males is well within the diagnostic range for _T. g.
gracilis_ (Table 6), the mean number of subcaudals of females is closer
to the mean of _gracilis_ than it is to the mean of _hallowelli_ (Table
5), and the mean of the ratio of tail length to total length of both
sexes is within or very close to the diagnostic range for _gracilis_
(Table 6).

Smith and Sanders (1952:218) pointed out an error in the range of
subcaudals in female _T. g. gracilis_ as stated in table 1 (p. 247) of
Kirn _et al._ We add some additional corrections that should be made on
the same page. In table two, column two ("Sex"), the words "male" and
"female" are reversed for each characteristic. Also, in table two,
column four ("Means from data of Force"), the means for caudals should
be corrected from 33.61 to 43.61 in females and from 39.99 to 50.32 in
males, as based on our recalculations from Force's data; we did not
recalculate the means of Force's data for the other characteristics.

The discussion above demonstrates that the number of subcaudals and the
ratio of tail length to total length are weak characteristics for
diagnosing _T. g. gracilis_ and _T. g. hallowelli_. The only remaining
diagnostic characteristic given by Kirn _et al._ (1949) is the number of
ventrals. Nevertheless, a step-cline in the number of ventrals, if one
exists, is yet to be demonstrated. Therefore, we completely agree with
Dowling (1957:32), who stated that "... the overlap in each character is
so great that any subspecific differences appear to be as yet undefined.
It is here suggested that _T. gracilis_ be retained as binomial...."

will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
