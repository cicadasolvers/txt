PREFACE.


The following is a brief untechnical presentation of general features
characterizing economically important species of wood. It is the
result of notes originally brought together from many already
existing sources and later augmented, and verified so far as possible
for the present use, by personal observation. The work of preparation
has not been as simple as the result would indicate, and although
great care has been taken to check each fact, errors do no doubt
exist, although it is not believed that there are important ones.

Engineers while writing upon woods have, save exceptionally,
emphasized strength beyond most other properties. Other works
for expert foresters or botanists are of necessity too special,
voluminous, fragmental, or technical for the casual student. Some
popular books on trees, as distinct from woods, are available. The
present form is distinct from these and is intended for those who are
not foresters or botanists, but who use woods or desire knowledge of
their distinguishing properties. Allusions to trees, historical and
other references, aside from those directly regarding woods, are made
for completeness and in order to mark, distinguish, or separate the
species.

Acknowledgments are particularly due to the publications of the U. S.
Division of Forestry, to Prof. Sargent's studies as set forth in Vol.
IX of the Tenth U. S. Census, to Dr. B. E. Fernow, to Mr. Raphael G.
Zon for suggestions and for technical revision, to the _Northwestern
Lumberman_ and other trade journals, to many dealers, who have been
uniform in their courtesy, and incidentally to Mr. Morris K. Jesup,
whose magnificent collection of woods at the New York Museum of
Natural History has been available to the writer as to others. These,
with other sources of information acknowledged by the writer, and
suggested to others, are suitably arranged in the following list. Of
the 155 illustrations, 138 are original, the drawings having been
prepared under the supervision of the writer from actual specimens by
Mr. Irving T. Worthly of Cornell University and several students of
New York University, and the photographs by Mr. John Hopfengartner,
Jr., of Westchester, New York City. Other illustrations are, so far
as possible, acknowledged in place.

 THE PRINCIPAL SPECIES OF WOOD.




 INTRODUCTION.


A tree has been defined as a woody plant that produces naturally and
in its native place one principal erect stem with a definite crown of
foliage. A plant thus attaining to the dignity of a tree is said to
be arborescent.[1]

There are nearly five hundred distinct species of trees growing
in the United States,[2] as well as many others peculiar to other
countries, yet the great mass of wood everywhere utilized is derived
from comparatively few of them.[3] Many woods will be more generally
employed as their valuable properties become more familiar or as the
supplies of wood now utilized continue to diminish.

The same tree is often called by different common names in different
places. Nearly thirty names are thus applied to the longleaf pine
(_Pinus palustris_). Such confusion can be avoided only by regarding
the recognized botanical nomenclature.

The botanical name of a plant consists of two principal terms
denoting genus and species. Quercus, for example, is [p002] the
generic name including all species of oak. Alba, rubra, and others
are specific names denoting the said species. Quercus alba and
Quercus rubra are completed terms. Genera are not fixed but differ
with authorities, so that the abbreviated name of the botanist
responsible for the classification adopted is often added, as Quercus
alba Linn. and Ulmus fulva Michx.

A species is a collection of individuals that might well have
sprung from some single root. A genus is a collection of related
species. Genera are gathered into families. Families and genera
differ with authorities. A variety includes individuals differing
slightly from accepted species. Its name when existing is part of the
specific name. "Quercus robur var. pedunculata" specifies a variety
(pedunculata) of "red" or strong (robur) oak (Quercus). A variety of
one botanist is sometimes a distinct species of another.

The size and character of the trunk, and the range, locality, or
distribution of the tree, have much to do with the utility of the
wood, since large or perfect timbers cannot be derived from species
characterized by small or crooked trees, and since wood is always
more used if it is widely distributed so as to be easily available.[4]

 [Illustration: FIG. 1.--SOME WOOD ELEMENTS.]

Wood is made up of cell-structures; as, the true fibre, which
originates from several cells; the tracheid (tra-ke-id), which
originates from one; the vessel, which is a short, wide tube joined
vertically end to end with others of its kind; the pith-ray; the
resin-duct, and others,--all of which are often popularly referred to
as fibres. [p003]

The character and the arrangement of cell-structures differ with
species. Wood is hard, soft, light, heavy, tough, porous, elastic, or
otherwise, because of these differences. Appearance is affected, and
woods may be distinguished from one another, because of this fact.[5]

Most wood is used in "construction," that is, in mines, railways,
houses, and ships, where demand is for size or quantity, and where
finish and appearance amount to but little. Much wood is used in
decoration and furniture, where appearance, appropriateness, and
finish are called for; but these woods, although much in evidence,
are infinitely less in quantity than those employed in construction.
Some wood is required for implements, turnery, carvings, and
small-piece work, where size is secondary and where qualities such as
hardness, fine grain, and uniformity, controllable in small pieces,
are primary. Some wood is used indirectly, as in the manufacture of
paper-pulp, gunpowder, and chemicals. There are also by-products of
trees, such as tanbark, turpentine, resin, nuts, and sugar.

The weight, strength, and other measurable properties of wood are
variable. Weight varies from day to day as water is absorbed and
evaporated. Strength differs with grain, age, moisture, specific
gravity, and many other things. Two pieces from different portions
of the same tree differ from each other. The proportions of sap
and heart wood are seldom constant. Results from small specimens
may differ from those obtained from larger ones.[6] The botanical
accuracy of a specimen is not always certain, therefore figures
relating to the physical properties of wood should be employed with
greater caution than those relating to the more homogeneous metals.

Many of the experiments conducted to establish statements regarding
the physical properties of wood have been defective [p004] in that
while the conclusions were correct as applied to the specimens
immediately studied, such specimens did not stand for the species at
large. The recognition of difficulties, the selection of specimens,
the scientific standardizing of methods so that results could be
generally utilized, as distinct from the simple manipulation of
specimens in testing-machines, have not been exhaustively attempted
until recently.[7]

The experiments that have been made to determine the strength of
woods may be grouped into the four following divisions:

 (1) Experiments conducted by the U. S. Division of Forestry (Dr.
 B. E. Fernow, Chief), under the direction of Professor J. B.
 Johnson. About forty thousand tests were made, distributed over
 thirty-one American species, the results, so far as obtained, being
 undoubtedly the most valuable in existence. The detail considered
 and methods evolved have in a way reclassed the testing of woods and
 must influence all future efforts, but results are disappointing
 in that they have been obtained for so few species, and some of
 these of commercially secondary importance. These experiments are
 characterized as follows:

 Completeness and Reliability of Records.
 Large and Small Test Pieces.
 Moisture Conditions Standardized at 12% Dry Weight.
 Samples from Representative Portions of Tree.
 Selection of Representative Trees.
 Uniformity of Methods.
 Large Number of Individual and Total Tests.
 Small Number of Species Covered.
 Specific Gravity Determinations.
 Soil and Forest Conditions Indicated.
 Botanical Accuracy Assured.

 These experiments are originally described in Circular No. 15
 and other publications of the U. S. Forestry Division, also in
 "Materials of Construction," by Professor J. B. Johnson.

 (2) Experiments conducted for the Tenth U. S. Census by Mr. J.
 P. Sharpless at the Watertown (Mass.) Arsenal upon specimens
 botanically selected by Professor Sargent. These experiments are
 less complete in detail, and averages are based upon infinitely
 [p005] fewer tests for each species. So far as known most specimens
 were from butts. Nothing is known of moisture conditions save that
 specimens were "carefully seasoned." Tests were upon about twelve
 hundred specimens divided over four hundred and twelve species,
 allowing but a small number for each. The series is most valuable
 in that the species attempted were so numerous as to present an
 almost complete American series; in that the botanical identity of
 the specimens was beyond question, and because it gives a general
 idea of relative values. The results are frequently quoted and
 appear on the accompanying pages in spaces immediately following
 those occupied by, or set apart for, "Forestry" figures or their
 alternates. The tests are characterized as follows:

 Botanical Accuracy Assured.
 Specific Gravity Determinations.
 Uniformity of Methods.
 Limited Number of Individuals and Total Tests.
 Large Number of Species Covered.
 Small Test Pieces Only.
 Selection and Moisture Conditions Indefinite.

 They are originally described in Vol. IX, Tenth U. S. Census;
 Executive Document No. 5, Forty-eighth Congress, First Session; in
 Catalogue of the "Jesup Collection," by Professor C. S. Sargent, and
 elsewhere.

 (3) Experiments conducted upon full-sized pieces. The most reliable
 investigations under this head were either conducted by Professor
 Lanza, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or else are
 noted by him in his work, "Applied Mechanics" (ed. 1895, pp.
 673-711). They are valuable in that specimens were selected on a
 commercial rather than on a scientific basis. Professor Lanza claims
 that such actual pieces are less perfect and show approximately one
 half the unit strength developed by the more carefully selected
 smaller specimens. These experiments are characterized as follows:

 Life-sized Specimens.
 Miscellaneous Selections as if for Practical Construction.
 Moisture and Other Data Indefinite.

 (4) All other experiments. Many experiments have been made from
 time to time which, while valuable, are not distinguished by any
 particular method or principle, such as separate the investigations
 noted in the preceding articles. Data as to selection of specimens,
 moisture, and other conditions are either incomplete or else
 absolutely lacking. Such tests are referred to as are noted in works
 of Hatfield, Trautwein, Lazlett, Rankine, Thurston, and others. Some
 of these series are exceedingly valuable comparatively. Professor
 Rankine and Mr. Lazlett experimented principally upon foreign woods.
 [p006]

The figures established by the United States Division of Forestry
and alluded to in item 1, page 4, appear, so far as they exist, upon
the following pages. Where they do not exist, the leading spaces set
apart for them are left vacant for other insertions as preferred.
All coefficients are in pounds per square inch. Fractions of pounds
in weight and lower figures in coefficients have been omitted as
superfluous.

It is not always easy to determine the species of living trees,
because forms in the forest differ from those in the open, because
bark varies with age, and because fruit and leaves of many trees are
lacking in the winter. It is easier to tell genus than species--that
a tree is an oak, than whether it is a red or a pin oak. Experience
is required in this connection.

Trees are divided into two general divisions known as Exogens and

 EXOGENOUS TREES.
 (_Dicotyledons_.)


Exogenous trees are those the trunks of which are built up by rings
or layers, each deposited consecutively upon the outside of the
others. A section exhibits first a central point or canal known as a
pith-cavity, next and consecutively the annual layers, and finally
the bark. The woods of this series are familiar to all. The oaks,
pines, and practically all of the merchantable lumbers are among
them. The forests are widely distributed, and the species are so
numerous as to present an almost infinite range of possibilities.

 [Illustration: FIG. 2.--SECTION BOXELDER, SHOWING PITH-CAVITY AT
  CENTRE.]

The young wood of exogenous trees is porous. It permits the passage
of sap and is known as sapwood (Alburnum). As a layer is enclosed by
others and retreats from the surface of the tree, it becomes denser,
its canals are filled with gums or tannin, color changes, and the
result is heartwood (Duramen). This change goes forward rapidly in
some trees, such as locusts, so that their sections appear to be
almost wholly heartwood; other species require longer time, and
sapwood then predominates.

Heartwood gives stability to the tree, but is not needed in its
physiological processes. It is tougher, heavier, stronger, and more
valued in construction. Sapwood is vitally essential to the life of
the tree, but is lighter, weaker, less durable, and less valued in
construction. Sapwood is pliable, and the sapwoods of several trees
are valued for this reason.

Wood-making varies as it takes place in the springtime and in the
summer. Consequent differences in the densities [p008] of the
deposits serve to mark the limits of the yearly rings. Some species,
as the oaks and hickories, show pores throughout their spring woods
which thus contrast with denser summer growths. Others, as Southern
pines, change sharply, and their spring and summer growths appear
as solid bands. In even climates, where seasons are not pronounced,
growth is more regular and layers correspondingly less definite.[9]

The cellular structure of wood is principally vertical, a fact that
explains the ease with which wood is split up and down. Beside the
vertical, there are horizontal cells, that cross the tree, strengthen
and bind the vertical cells, and assist in the life-processes of the
tree. These horizontal cells form what are known as medullary or
pith-rays and appear as simple lines or glistening plates according
to the way in which the wood is cut. Woods differ in the size and
number of these rays, which are by no means always visible to the eye
(see plate 3).

 [Illustration: FIG. 3.]

Woods are easy or difficult to work in proportion as their fibres
are arranged in a simple or a complicated manner. This is shown in
the figures on plate 4. A knife pressed upon the oak must crush or
cut into the fibres themselves, whereas with the pine it finds some
natural passage between the cells. Wood may be cut so as to develop
cross-sections (_C_, Fig. 3), radial sections (_R_), or tangential
sections (_T_). The respective [p009] markings are in a general
way indicated on the boards in the figure.

  one is a resin-duct; the circles are ends of fibres (tracheids);

Logs are sometimes sawn into quarters and then into pieces crossing
and exposing the yearly rings. (See Fig. 4.) These "quarter-sawn"
surfaces are structurally stronger and better, but are, by reason
of waste or small pieces, more costly than others. The pith-rays of
some woods, such as oaks, are very prominent when split as they are
in "quarter-sawing," and the appearance of such woods is consequently
improved.[10]

 [Illustration: FIG. 4.]

Exogenous trees are divided into broad-leaved trees and needle-leaved
conifers. The broad, flat leaves of trees such as oaks and chestnuts
gave rise to the former term, while the narrow resinous leaves of the
pine and hemlock gave rise to the latter. The woods of the former
group are usually referred to as hard woods, although some of them
are very soft; those of the latter group are referred to as soft
woods, although some of them are very hard. Most, but not all, of the
broadleaf trees are deciduous, that is, they change their foliage
every year; and most, but not all, of the needleleaf trees are
evergreen, that is, the foliage is persistent. Needleleaf trees are
also known as conifers, that is, cone-bearers.

It is usual to associate the terms broadleaf, deciduous, and hard
wood; and likewise the terms needleleaf, conifer, evergreen, and
soft wood. While generally correct, this is, as seen, not always so.
A better division is into broadleaf trees or woods, and needleleaf
conifers. [p010]


 BROADLEAF WOODS.

The trees affording these woods are found in natural forests and
under cultivation in nearly every portion of the globe. The histories
of some of them extend back to very remote periods. Their woods were
the principal ones in construction until the advent of American soft
woods. The oaks, elms, maples, and other so-called hard woods are of
this group.

Broadleaf woods are characterized by complex fibre conditions,
absence of resins, and greater weights.[11] They are composed of
several kinds of cells and fibres, arranged without the regularity so
noticeable in the conifers. Cross-sections exhibit numerous, often
easily visible pores, arranged in zones or scattered throughout
the rings (see plate 2). Pith-rays are numerous and more or less
conspicuous, save in softer hard woods such as poplar. Woods are
difficult to work in proportion as they are complicated in structure.
The numerous members of the group vary from one another and present
an extensive range of properties. Trees do not usually afford
large pieces. Woods for cabinet work, implements, and other fine
purposes are from this group. The total requirement is less than for
needleleaf woods.

The leaves of broadleaf trees are easily distinguished from the
resinous, usually evergreen ones of the conifers. Most of them are
deciduous, that is, shed every season, although some are persistent,
that is, "evergreen." "Broadleaf," "deciduous," and "hardwood" trees
are the same. [p011]

 [Illustration: PLATE 5. WHITE OAK (_Quercus alba_).]


 OAK.
 (_Quercus_.)

The oaks are found on all of the continents of the northern
hemisphere, as well as at high altitudes just south of the equator.
Their woods stand pre-eminent among those of the broadleaf series
and have been highly prized from early periods. Formerly relied
upon for all purposes of house and naval architecture, they did not
give way to the so-called "soft woods" for houses, and to iron for
vessels, until comparatively recent periods. They were supplanted
for the former purposes upon the opening of the soft-wood forests of
North America and of the Baltic, and for vessels subsequent to the
conclusions of the American Civil War.

The historical importance of oak is founded upon the reputation
of the English Oak as derived from two trees, Quercus robur var.
pedunculata and Quercus robur var. sessiliflora, usually taken as
sub-species of Quercus robur.[12] It is said that these trees once
formed large forests over Northern and Central Europe. Live-oak has
always been highly esteemed, but is now very scarce. It is one of the
hardest, heaviest, and most durable of constructive woods and was
once largely employed in ship-building. The wood of the White Oak
(_Quercus alba_) is at present preferred for most purposes for which
oak is now employed, and is one of the most valuable of the American
hard woods.

Oak is tough, durable, easily obtained, liable to warp and check
in seasoning, often hard to nail without splitting, susceptible
of high polish, and not greatly liable to attack by insects. It
contains gallic acid, causing peculiar taste and odor and attacking
iron, the solutions staining the wood. Experiments[13] indicate
that iron fastenings are shortly protected by an insoluble scale
of resulting salt, and that the wood, although [p012] darkened,
remains practically uninjured. The later oaken vessels were
iron-fastened,[14] and cabinet-makers now employ that metal in
joining oak. The barks of all species are also so charged with acid
as to be used in the tanning of leather. The several kinds of oak are
commercially divisible into three general groups, white oak, red or
black oak, and live oak.[15] The principal species affording woods
under each head are as follows:

 White Oak.
 White Oak (Q. alba).
 Cow Oak (Q. michauxii).
 Chestnut Oak (Q. prinus).
 Post Oak (Q. minor).
 Bur Oak (Q. macrocarpa).
 Pacific Post Oak (Q. garryanna).

 Red or Black Oak.
 Red Oak (Q. rubra).
 Pin Oak (Q. palustris).
 Spanish Oak (Q. digitata).
 Yellow or Black Oak (Q. velutina).

 Live Oak.
 Live Oak (Q. virginiana).
 California Live Oak (Q. agrifolia).
 Live Oak (Q. chrysolepis)

 [Illustration: WHITE OAK (_Quercus alba_).]

 [Illustration: RED OAK (_Quercus rubra_).]

Oak trees are characterized by oblong, thin-shelled kernels,
protruding from hard scaly cups and called acorns. The foliage is
sometimes deciduous and sometimes evergreen. Most oaks require many
years to reach maturity, but are then long-lived. Fifty of the nearly
three hundred known species of oak are natives of the United States
and Canada; all but four become trees under favorable conditions.
Quercus is from two Celtic words, _quer_, signifying fine, and
_cuex_, a tree. [p013]

 red, but robur is a noun meaning strength; the adjective robustus
 means "oaken" or vigorous. [p027]

 [Illustration: PLATE 6. WHITE ASH (_Fraxinus americana_).]


 ASH.
 (_Fraxinus_.)

Ash is widely distributed over the temperate regions of the northern
hemisphere, and occurs in the tropics, on the island of Cuba. The
tree has occupied a position second only to that of oak. Our Teutonic
forefathers relied upon its wood for boats and weapons. Their ancient
faith connects it with the creation of the original man. It is often
associated with oak in country proverbs.[21] Europeans regard the
trees for ornamental purposes, but Americans value them for wood.

 [Illustration: White Ash (_Fraxinus americana_).]

Ash and oak woods resemble one another in that there are bands of
open pores in both woods, but the pith-rays of the ash are thinner
and scarcely discernible. Ash is coarser, less attractive, easier
to work, tough, elastic, and somewhat lighter than oak. It seasons
well, but does not last when exposed to the weather. Lumbermen
separate the woods into white and black ash, the former including the
lighter-colored and more desirable pieces. This commercial division
is also a botanical one in the North, where the only species of
any note are the white ash and black ash (_F. americana_ and _F.
nigra_). The Southern green ash (_F. lanceolata_) is usually classed
as white ash. The trees that grow up after the cutting of the virgin
forest afford tougher, more pliable, but not necessarily stronger
pieces, known as "second-growth" ash. Although not relied upon for
out-of-door construction, ash is one of the most important of the
cheaper cabinet woods and is used in stairs, furniture, and similar
works. [p028]

One half of the thirty known species of the genus Fraxinus inhabit
North America. [p029]


 FOOTNOTES

 [Footnote 21: A tradition, old in Pliny's time, is that serpents
 avoid ash trees; another is that ash is particularly liable to be
 struck by lightning. (Keeler.)]

 The name ash is also applied to several species of the genus
 Pyrus or Sorbus, to which the apple, pear, quince, and some other
 trees belong. "Mountain Ash" is either Pyrus americana or Pyrus
 sambucifolia. Both species, with their bright red berries, are to
 be classed as shrubs rather than trees; their light, soft, weak,
 close-grained woods having no economic importance, save perhaps for
 fuel. The series is partially as follows:

  Pyrus malus (Common apple).
  Pyrus coronaria (American crab-apple).
  Pyrus communis (Common pear).
  Pyrus vulgaris (Common quince).
  Pyrus americana (Mountain ash).
  Pyrus sambucifolia (Mountain ash).
  Pyrus ancuparia (Rowan tree, European Mountain ash).

 The Toothache Trees, Xanthoxylum americana and Xanthoxylum
 clava-herculis (Linn.), are known as ash and prickly ash. The gopher
 wood, Cladrastis tinctoria, is yellow ash. These woods are not
 important.

 ELM.
 (_Ulmus_.)

The different species of elm are distributed over the cold and
temperate portions of the northern hemisphere, save western United
States and Canada. A high degree of perfection is attained in eastern
North America, where trees are greatly prized for their form and
appearance.

The foliage of the elm is concentrated at the top, and the absence of
lower branches causes it to be a good tree to plant near houses or
along streets. Much of the wood is tough, fibrous, durable, strong,
hard, heavy, and, because it is so often cross-grained, difficult to
split and work. The large pores of the spring wood arranged in one
or several rows mark the annual deposit, while the minute pores of
the summer wood arranged in concentric wavy lines are so peculiar as
to distinguish this wood from all others. The tall, straight trunks
afford pieces of considerable size. Elm piles sustain constant and
severe shocks for long intervals. The grain arrangement of elm is
often very beautiful, so that it is increasingly used for decoration.
It is more commonly employed in the construction of cars, wagons,
boats, agricultural implements, machinery, and furniture.

 [Illustration: ELM (_Ulmus americana_).]

The shape of the trees is so marked as to cause them to be easily
noted. Fifteen or sixteen species have been recognized. Five are
known to exist in the eastern American forests, and all of them
furnish good wood of commercial importance. _Ulmus_ was the ancient
name of the elm. [p036]

 MAPLE.
 (_Acer_.)

The maples grow on all of the continents of the northern hemisphere.
Nearly one half of the known species belong in China, Japan, and the
Orient. The principal European species (_Acer pseudo-platanus_) is
the European sycamore.[25] The hard or sugar maple (_Acer saccharum_)
is one of the principal deciduous trees of North America.

Maple wood[26] is characterized by its appearance and by its fine
compact texture. The first quality is so marked that selected pieces
take rank among the most beautiful of cabinet woods; the last is so
pronounced as to fit it for carvings and even for type. "Birdseye,"
"blister," and "curly" maples are not from different species, but
are the results of fibre distortions, possible in some form in any
tree of any species, but peculiarly liable to occur in the maple;
birdseye and blister effects for the most part in the hard maples,
curly effects in the hard, but generally in the softer, species. The
distortions do not occur in all trees, and it is seldom possible to
tell whether the woods are thus figured until after the trees have
been cut. Maple wood shrinks moderately, stands well in protected
places, is strong, tough, but not durable when exposed. Pores are
not arranged in circles, but are scattered irregularly throughout
the layers. Maple is used for ceiling, flooring, panelling, car and
ship construction, shoe-lasts, shoe-pegs, furniture, school supplies,
implements, and machinery. Sugar is principally, although not
exclusively, present in the sap of the sugar maple.[27] The softer
species are sometimes [p041] tapped, and sugar is also present
in the sap of other trees, such as the butternut and birch. A sugar
maple will, on an average, produce about twenty-five gallons of sap,
containing a total of about six pounds of sugar, in a season.

 [Illustration: PLATE 8. SUGAR MAPLE (_Acer saccharum_).]

 [Illustration: "Curly" Maple Wood (_dissection_).]

The Boxelder (_Acer negundo_) is a true maple, remarkable in that it
is widely distributed from Canada to Mexico and from the Atlantic to
the Rocky Mountains, on low bottom lands, and at elevations of five
thousand and six thousand feet.[28] The trees are beautiful and, like
other maples are valued for ornamental purposes. The soft, light wood
is not particularly noted, although occasionally used for woodenware,
interior finish, and paper-pulp. Small quantities of sugar are
present in the sap of this tree.

 [Illustration: _a_, Box Elder. _b_, Hard or Sugar Maple. _c_, Soft or
  Red Maple. _d_, Soft or Silver Maple.]

The maples may be told by their leaves of characteristic shape, but
chiefly by their two-seeded fruit or "keys," the two wings of which
spread differently in different species. The leaves of some species
change in autumn from green to red and other brilliant colors. Those
of other species change to yellow without trace of red. Sixty to
seventy species have been distinguished, nine of which occur in North
America. [p042]

 Black Walnut Tree (_Juglans nigra_).
 Black Walnut Trunk (_Juglans nigra_).
 Black, White, and English Walnuts.

 WALNUT.
 (_Juglans_.)

The English or Royal Walnut (_Juglans regia_), a native of Persia,
was the only available species of this genus until the introduction
of the nearly similar Black Walnut of North America.[29] As oak gave
way first to soft woods for construction, so it gave way first to
walnut for cabinet purposes. The wood soon became very fashionable,
and exorbitant prices were paid for it. Walnut was extremely popular
in the United States until about 1880, when oak began to resume its
place as the popular cabinet wood. The nuts of the English or Persian
walnut are better than those of the American species, but the wood of
the latter is superior.

The use of walnut wood for gun-stocks began in Europe, the demands
early becoming so great that, until the general peace following
the battle of Waterloo, the greater part of the French product was
diverted for that purpose, while prices rose in England so that
six hundred pounds sterling is reported to have been paid for a
single tree. In spite of the innumerable woods that have since been
introduced, this one is yet regarded as best for gun-stocks.[30]
Walnut is a firm, hard, chocolate-colored wood, with pores not
arranged in rings but scattered somewhat irregularly. The sombre,
although rich, color has been objected to for some positions. Large
excrescences or "burrs" are common on foreign trees, particularly
those near the Black Sea and in Italy. The grain in such growths is
beautifully irregular, and the wood, known as "burl," is prized for
veneers. Trees are very scarce, and walnut is now seldom seen save
in cabinet work or gun-stocks. The related White Walnut or Butternut
(_Juglans cinerea_) affords a less-prized and [p048] lighter-tinted
wood. The nuts of the walnuts are a source of profit.

Black walnut trees seldom form forests by themselves, but occur
generally in mixed growth. They grow quickly, but the heartwood for
which the tree is valued begins to form only when the tree is at a
considerable age, so that a number of years must elapse before a tree
can produce wood of the desired quality. Trees one hundred years old
furnish the best quality of wood.

Walnut trees may be known by their nuts, the husks or pods of which
adhere unbroken, instead of loosening, completely divide into four
sections, as with the hickories. Juglans is from _Jovis_, signifying
Jove's, and _glans_, signifying acorn. This nut, not the fruit of the
oak, was the acorn of the ancients.[31] [p049]

 [Illustration: PLATE 10. HICKORY (_Hicoria ovata_).]


 HICKORY.
 (_Hicoria_ or _Carya_.)

The Hickories occur only in the eastern part of North America. They
produce woods in which the qualities of toughness, elasticity, and
resilience are unusually pronounced, and since these qualities are
greatest in the sapwood, hickories are peculiar in that the sapwood
is more valuable than the heart. Second-growth wood is much prized,
since, being younger, it contains more of the pliable sapwood.[32]

Hickory is not durable when exposed and is more or less subject to
attack by boring-insects. It is used for implements, machinery,
carriages, and the like; hickory axe-helves have no superiors. The
nuts of the shagbark or white hickory are a source of considerable
profit. The pecan (_Hicoria pecan_) affords wood so inferior as to
be little used in construction, although it makes an excellent fuel.
Pecans are planted in many of the Southern States because of the
nuts, for which a considerable demand exists.

The Hickories are known by their nuts, the husks or pods of which
loosen completely from the nut in four pieces, instead of adhering
unbroken as in the case of the walnuts. The nine species are American
trees, eight of them being natives of the United States. _Carya_ was
the Greek name of the common walnut. Hickory is said to be derived
from the Indian _powcohicora_, a liquor once obtained from the nuts
of the hickory. [p052]

 CHESTNUT, CHINQUAPIN.
 (_Castanea_.)

The chestnut is found in the temperature regions of central and
southern Europe, northern Africa, China, Japan, and eastern North
America. The wood is valued in construction, and the much-prized nuts
are regarded as a food rather than a confection. European chestnut
wood was once high in favor, although examination of structures
in which it was supposed to have been used indicates that in some
instances oak had been mistaken for it and had been employed in its
place.

The North American chestnut affords a weak, brittle, but easily
worked and very durable wood, such as is admirably adapted for
beams, ties, and sills, where lightness and durability rather
than much transverse strength are required. Trees in Europe have
attained to great size and age. Micheaux mentions one thirty feet in
circumference six feet from the ground and said to have been standing
for a thousand years. The famous Mt. Etna chestnut[37] is reported
to have measured two hundred and four feet in circumference. Large
trunks are apt to be hollow, affording brittle, useless wood. The
botanical relation between the American and European chestnuts is
not distinct. Some consider the former a distinct species, others a
variety only. The name "Chinquapin" applies to two distinct botanical
species, one, the Castanea pumila, closely related to the common
chestnut; the other, Castanopsis chrysophylla, belonging to the same
family (Cupuliferae), but to quite another genus. Both afford woods
resembling, but heavier than, chestnut.

 [Illustration: PLATE 11. CHESTNUT (_Castanea dentata_).
 (_Courtesy N. C. Geological Survey_.)]

The chestnut may be known by its large prickly burr, [p057]
containing from one to three thin-shelled, triangular, wedge-shaped
nuts. Both chinquapins have prickly burrs containing one, or
sometimes two, sweet edible nuts. Three of the four known species of
the genus Castanea grow in North America, one the common chestnut
(_Castanea vulgaris_); another the Chinquapin (_Castanea pumila_);
the third a plant never attaining to the size of a tree. The
Chinquapin (_Castanopsis chrysophylla_) is the only North American
representative of a genus including twenty-five species. Keeler
says that Castanea is from a town of that name in Thessaly, or from
another town of that name in Pontus. [p058]

(_Fagus atropunicea_) is the only American representative. Eastern
species have figured in literature since the time of Virgil. The
northern nations early wrote upon thin tablets of beechwood, and
_boc_, _bok_, and _buche_, the northern names for beech, finally gave
origin to the word book.[38] American Indians believed that the beech
was proof against lightning.

 [Illustration: BEECH (_Fagus atropunicea_).]

Beechwood is hard, heavy, strong, not durable when exposed, and
somewhat subject to attack by insects. European engineers employ it
to a considerable extent in construction, but it is seldom used in
America save for indoor finish, furniture, handles, flooring, and
the like. The small edible nuts, known as beech-mast, are pressed
abroad for a fixed oil, resembling and used in place of that from the
olive. They are seldom gathered in this country, but are devoured by
animals. Beech-trees have smooth, light-colored bark, and are very
attractive in their winter appearance. They may be recognized earlier
in the season by their small prickly burrs, each containing two
triangular, sharp-edged nuts. There are fifteen or more species known
to belong to this genus. _Fagus_ is from _phago_, to eat, and refers
to the nut.

 [Illustration: PLATE 12. BEECH (_Fagus_).]

The name Ironwood has been applied to Blue Beech (_Carpinus
caroliniana_), to the Hornbeam (_Ostrya virginiana_), and to at least
eight other North American species affording unusually hard and heavy
woods, such as are used for handles [p061] and implements.[39]
Trunks of trees affording these woods are generally small and
the weight of the woods is so great as to prevent their use in
construction. [p062]

 SYCAMORE.
 (_Platanus_.)

The name Sycamore applies to a maple (_Acer pseudo-platanus_) in
Europe, to a fig-tree (_Ficus sycomorus_) in the Orient,[40] and to
the buttonball or plane tree (_Platanus_) in North America. Of the
plane trees (_Platanus_) the common or Oriental plane (_Platanus
orientalis_) is a native of Europe; the plane, buttonball, or
sycamore tree (_Platanus occidentalis_) is a native and common tree
in eastern North America; and the California plane, buttonball, or
sycamore (_Platanus racemosa_) is a native of western North America.

The sycamore stands for curiosity, because of its Biblical
association with Zaccheus. Many European sycamores were planted by
religious persons during the middle ages because of the belief that
they were the trees thus referred to in the Bible.

 [Illustration: SYCAMORE (_Platanus occidentalis_).]

The woods afforded by the American sycamores have unusually
complicated, cross-grained, but beautiful structures, difficult
to work, but standing well and valued for cabinet work and small
articles. American trees are often very large.

American buttonball or sycamore trees are distinguished by rough
balls which remain hanging on long stems throughout the winter. The
bark also is shed to an unusual extent; flakes of the outer cover
drop away, exposing smooth inner surfaces so white as to appear as if
painted. Six or seven species are included in the genus; three occur
in North America. _Platanus_ is from _platus_, signifying broad, and
refers to the shape of the leaves. [p066]

 BIRCH.
 (_Betula_.)

The birches grow in Europe, Asia, and North America, their ranges on
the latter continent extending far into the north.[42] Their history
is remote and probably began with attention to the bark rather than
to the wood.

Birch-bark is smooth, pliable, water-tight, and by reason of its
resinous oils so durable that it often remains intact long after the
wood inside of fallen trees has disappeared. It is separable into
thin layers and was early employed as a writing material.[43] Houses
have been covered by it and it has been used for cordage, utensils,
"damp courses," and even rude clothing. The American Indians employed
it for canoes, tents, troughs, and buckets. The wood is hard, heavy,
strong, fine-grained, and beautiful. It shrinks in seasoning,
works easily, stands well when not exposed. It is used for spools,
woodenware, and other small articles, as well as for interior finish
and cabinet work. Figured birch is one of the most beautiful of
American cabinet woods.[44] Birch is often stained so as to imitate
cherry and mahogany; the best imitations of the latter wood are of
birch. Birch is commercially divided, according to the quantity
of heartwood present, into white birch and red birch. The wood is
"white" when the amount is small, and as heartwood increases with age
the same tree might at one time afford white and at another red wood.

Birch trees may be known by their more or less laminated bark with
its peculiar long horizontal lenticles or dashes. The [p069]
leaves of the several birches differ but little, but the decided
colors exhibited by their barks give names and serve to distinguish
the species. Nine of the twenty-four known species of birch occur in
North America; six are trees and the others low shrubs. _Betula_ is
said to be derived from bitumen. [p070]

 Honey Locust (_Gleditsia triacanthos_).
 Locust Wood.]


 LOCUST, MESQUITE.
 (_Robinia, Gleditsia, Prosopis_.)

The name Locust applies to species of three distinct genera, all of
which belong to the family Leguminosae. The black locust (_Robinia
pseudacacia_), the honey locust (_Gleditsia triacanthos_), and
the Mesquite or honey locust (_Prosopis juliflora_) are principal
representatives of their respective kinds. The first-named genus is
North American, the other two have species on both continents.

 [Illustration: BLACK LOCUST (_Robinia pseudacacia_).]

Black locust wood is tough, durable, unequalled for torsional
strength and resilience, and is in every way in the first rank of
American woods. It is fitted not only for exposed constructions,
but for finer articles; hubs, pins, bolts, and trenails having no
superiors. Trees develop rapidly when young, heart wood forming as
early as the third year. Later growth and ultimate commercial value
in the United States are much affected by insect borers, which
practically limit the usefulness of the species. The black locust may
be known by its clusters of large pea-blossom-shaped flowers, its
bean-shaped pods, three to six inches in length, and by the prickles
on the bark. The genus has six species, four of which are natives
of the United States.[45] _Robinia_ is from Robin, the name of an
early French botanist. [p076] The black locust has been extensively
introduced into Europe, both for ornamentation and for wood.[46]

The wood of the honey locust resembles that of the black locust,
but is seldom used or appreciated save for fencing and similarly
unimportant purposes. Trees grow rapidly and are not subject to
the attacks of insects, so that they frequently attain to normal
proportions. The flowers are much smaller than those of the
black locust, but the pods are several times as long (twelve to
eighteen inches). These often curl in drying and are thus rolled
to some distance by the wind. Thorns or spines are present on some
individuals and are often from three to six inches in length. The
foliage resembles but is more delicate than that of the black locust.
There is at least one other American species. _Gleditsia_ is from
Gleditsch, the name of a botanist.

Mesquite, also called honey locust, affords wood that is hard, heavy,
and almost indestructible in exposed positions. The tree grows in
the desert where vegetation would often seem to be impossible. The
roots are developed to great size by their search for water, and are
gathered and burned in the absence of other fuel. The trunks are
small, but afford posts and ties. There are pods filled with rich
edible pulp. Sixteen or more species belong to this genus, prosopis,
of which one other, the screw-pod mesquite (_Prosopis odorata_), is
found in the United States. [p077]

 WHITEWOOD OR TULIP-TREE WOOD,     POPLAR OR COTTONWOOD,
 (_Liriodendron_.)                 (_Populus_.)

 CUCUMBER-TREE WOOD,               BASSWOOD.
 (_Magnolia_.)                     (_Tilia_.)

These trees are not related, but are all noted for woods with soft,
fine qualities, such as fit them for carvings, woodenware, and
paper-pulp. No one of the woods is durable when exposed, and all are
used for boxes because they nail without splitting. The names are
commercially interchangeable.

The whitewood or tulip tree (_Liriodendron tulipifera_) is a
native of America and an acclimated tree in Europe. It is the sole
surviving species of its genus. The wood is soft, stiff, clean,
fine, straight-grained, and obtainable in large-sized pieces. Much
whitewood is made into lumber, the wood standing among those of the
broadleaf series as white pine does among the conifers. Whitewood
is particularly suitable for carvings. In spite of its name it is
largely greenish yellow. It is often divided commercially, according
to color, into "white poplar" and "yellow poplar." Trunks often
attain to a very large size. Matthews mentions a specimen[48]
thirty-three feet in circumference. The species may be known by its
large tulip-shaped flower. _Liriodendron_ is from two Greek words
meaning lily and tree.

 [Illustration: PLATE 16. WHITEWOOD OR TULIP TREE (_Liriodendron
  tulipifera_).]

The poplars, sometimes called cottonwoods because of their seeds
covered with a cotton-like down, are represented on both continents.
The wood was made into shields by the [p081] ancients, because
it was light and tough and would indent without breaking. The wood
is often substituted for whitewood, but is less desirable, although
valuable as a basis for paper-pulp. The trees may be known by the
long drooping catkins that appear early in the spring before the
leaves, and that are followed by white downy seeds that soon escape
to whiten the surrounding ground. The poplars are noted for foliage
more or less constantly in agitation. This peculiarity, so pronounced
in the aspen (_Populus tremuloides_), is due to the very long
petioles or leaf-stems. The cottonwoods abound in many otherwise arid
regions of American Western deserts.

The cucumber trees are of the magnolia family and grow in many of the
Eastern States. The wood resembles and is probably often mistaken for
whitewood, for which it is a fair substitute. The trees may be known
by their fruit, which resembles vegetable cucumbers. Magnolia is from
Magnol, a botanist of the seventeenth century.

Basswood is a name applied to trees known in Europe and America
as limes, lime trees, lind, linden, tiel, tiel trees, bass, and
basswood trees. The trees and their wood were early esteemed, the
first for their shade and appearance, and the last for their working
qualities, which resemble, but are inferior to, whitewood.[49] The
trees are characterized by their dense foliage and clusters of small
cream-colored fragrant flowers, so attractive to bees as to have
originated the further name bee-tree. _Tilia_ arises from the ancient
name for these trees. [p082]

 WILLOW.
 (_Salix_.)

The willows are very widely distributed over both continents, and
their history extends back over a very considerable period. Pliny
states that Britons used to make voyages in boats of willow. The
willow mentioned in the Bible was the Salix babylonica, or weeping
willow, later acclimated in this country.

The principal experience with the tough, light, workable, elastic
wood has been in Europe. The ancients used it for shields, because
it was one of the woods that would indent without breaking. Lazlett
states that it is used for cart-linings because it will not splinter
when struck by stones. It has been used for lap-boards, cricket-bats,
keels, paddles, and water-wheels. It resists heat and friction and is
therefore used for lining friction-brakes. Willow charcoal ignites
readily and is highly esteemed in the manufacture of the finer kinds
of gunpowder. The bark is used in tanning. The little branches have
long been associated with baskets and woven work. American trees are
seldom cut up into lumber, but are valued for shade and appearance,
and are often planted along the banks of streams to prevent erosion.

Willows grow very rapidly and have a characteristic and attractive
appearance. They usually prefer low moist places. There are so many
hybrids and peculiar species as to render classification in all
cases difficult.[50] Black willow is the native species, oftenest
attaining to tree size in North America. The White, Crack, Bedford,
and Goat Willows (_Salix alba_, _S. fragilis_, _S. russeliana_, and
_S. caprea_) are said to afford good wood. _Salix_ is said to be from
the Celtic _sal_, meaning near, and _lis_, water. Salicylic acid is
abundantly present in the bark of some species. [p089]

 CATALPA.
 (_Catalpa_.)

Many kinds of wood that were formerly plentiful are now much less
so. Attention is being turned to trees that give best results under
artificial conditions. Catalpa, formerly but little known, now bids
fair to become of some importance in this connection.

The catalpa grows rapidly and produces a coarse, brittle, weak, but
durable and desirable, lumber, well fitted to meet the requirements
of railways and other branches of construction where the annual
consumption is the largest. Fifty thousand catalpa trees have
recently been planted by a Western railway at a cost of one cent
apiece. Catalpas at Hutchison, Kansas, were large enough to cut for
posts at the end of six years.[51] A sample tie recently removed
from a Western railway was found to be perfect after fifteen years
of service. Mr. John Brown[52] mentions specimens sixteen inches in
diameter seventeen years after planting. The species Catalpa speciosa
is said to be much the more desirable in that it is hardy and reaches
a tall upright form.

The catalpa may be known by its showy flowers, suggesting those of
the horse chestnut. These are succeeded by long pods filled with
many-winged seeds and often used by children as cigars. [p091]

 [Illustration: PLATE 19. SASSAFRAS (_Sassafras officinale_).]


 SASSAFRAS.       MULBERRY.
 (_Sassafras_.)   (_Morus_.)

The sassafras was one of the first American trees to be described
in Europe,[53] where many fictitious properties were early credited
to its aromatic essences. The wood is not distinguished by unusual
qualities, but trees are cut for lumber as encountered with other
and more valuable species in the forest. The mucilaginous leaves
are of three separate shapes. Some have lobes on both sides of the
central surface, others have one lobe at one side so as to resemble
mittens, while yet others on the same branch have simple oval shapes.
The dark-blue berries on bright-red stems are so eagerly devoured
by birds as to be seldom seen. The characteristic flavor is most
pronounced in the bark of the root.

The Red, White, and Black Mulberries are named from the color
of their fruits. The former, which is the American species, has
wood resembling that of the sassafras, only in that it is not
distinguished by unusual qualities. Its leaves, like that of
the sassafras, are of several shapes on the same tree. The very
sweet fruit resembles blackberries in form. The leaves used in
silkworm-culture are from the Russian mulberry, a cross between the
white mulberry and black mulberry (M. alba and M. nigra).[54] [p094]

 BUCKEYE. HORSE CHESTNUT.
 (_Aesculus_.)

The buckeye and horse chestnut are species of the same genus. The
common horse chestnut (_Aesculus hippocastanum_) was once thought
to have been a native of Asia, but it is now quite certain that
it originated on the mountains of northern Greece. Trees have
been cultivated in Europe for at least three centuries and are
now extensively grown over the United States. The name buckeye is
generally applied to such species as are natives of North America.

 [Illustration: Horse Chestnut (_Aesculus hippocastanum_).]

The woods resemble one another in that they are soft,
straight-grained, easily worked, and decay rapidly when exposed.
They are employed to some extent in woodenware, artificial limbs,
and paper-making. The trees may be known by their round prickly
pods, containing smooth chestnut-colored bitter nuts. The leaves
of the buckeye are arranged in groups of five, while those of the
horse chestnut are in groups of seven. The horse chestnut produces
showy spotted flowers. There are thirteen species of this genus,
eight of which are North American. The name "horse chestnut" may
refer ironically to the coarse nuts, or may arise from the fact that
they are occasionally eaten by cattle, or from a horseshoe marking
seen on young twigs. _Hippocastanum_ is from _hippos_, a horse, and
_castanea_, a chestnut. The name buckeye refers to the appearance
of the brown nut through the paler husk partly separated when ripe,
suggesting the eye of the common deer. [p097]

 [Illustration: PLATE 21. SWEET GUM (_Liquidambar styraciflua_).]


 GUM.
 (_Liquidambar, Nyssa_.)

This name is applied to two unrelated American trees--the Sweet or
Red Gum (_Liquidambar styraciflua_), a member of the witch-hazel
family, and the Sour or Black Gum (_Nyssa sylvatica_), which is one
of the dogwoods.

The woods afforded by these two trees are also distinct from one
another, although both are referred to by the one name, gum. The
softer Sweet Gum figures in carpentry. Selected pieces so resemble
black walnut as to be cut into veneers and made up into furniture.
Sour Gum is harder, it splits with difficulty, and is fitted for
small work and implements, such as wagon-hubs and tool-handles. Both
woods are close-and often cross-grained, besides being strong, heavy,
tough, and difficult to season.

 [Illustration: SWEET GUM (_Liquidambar styraciflua_).]

The Sweet Gum tree is characterized by rough, round balls, resembling
those of the sycamore, by pointed star-like leaves, suggesting those
of the sugar maple, and by corky ridges on the bark of younger
branches. These latter cause the bark to resemble alligator-skin and
give rise to the name alligator-wood. _Liquidambar_ refers to gums
excreted by the tree and sometimes used in medicine. The Sour Gum
bears ovoid bluish-black sour drupes, or fruit containing single
roughened seeds. The thick oval leaves are dark green above and dull
or hairy below. The foliage of both species becomes brilliant in
autumn. [p100]

 (_Ilex_.)   (_Buxus, Cornus, etc_.)   (_Guajacum_.)

The woods afforded by these trees are all demanded in small and
very perfect pieces to fill needs for which no others appear to be
perfectly fitted. The holly (_Ilex_) grows in Europe and America,
where the brilliant evergreen foliage and red berries have long been
associated with the Christmas season. The name holly is probably a
subversion of "Holy."[57] The true boxwood (_Buxus sempervirens_)
attains to some size in Europe and Asia, but remains a small shrub in
America, where it is seldom if ever cut for wood, but is placed as a
decoration along the borders of walks and gardens. The wood called
"boxwood" in America is not therefore derived from the "box." The
Lignumvitaes grow in Florida, the West Indies, and on the northern
coast of South America.

Holly-wood is noted for its fine, even grain, but chiefly for its
smooth, ivory-white color, fitting it for the white of inlaid work,
for carvings and other decorations where white color and fine
qualities are required. The principal European source is the Ilex
aquifolium, while in America it is the Ilex opaca. Boxwood is, as
stated, the name applied to several woods, all noted for their fine
compact structure, rendering them suitable for very fine carvings
such as are required in wood-engraving. The Eastern product as cut
from the true box is so highly prized as to be sold by the pound.
American boxwood is chiefly derived from the Flowering Dogwood, the
Mexican Persimmon, and the Rose Bay. In Australia several species
of Eucalyptus are said to be used. Lignumvitae is noted for great
strength and hardness. Layers of fibres alternately cross one another
so that the wood may be said to crumble rather than split. It has no
superior for implements that must be [p104] fine, true, and strong,
such as the sheaves of pulleys and handles of tools. The supply is
obtained from two species (Guajacum sanctum and Guajacum officinale).

Holly may be known by its foliage and berries. Box (_Buxus_) has
small, smooth, ovate, dark, evergreen leaves joining the stem so as
to be opposite one another. The Dogwood is known by its flowers; the
Lignum-vitae is a low gnarled tree. [p105]

 LAUREL.
 (_Magnolia, Rhododendron, Arbutus, etc._)

The name Laurel applies locally or botanically to a number of
American plants, several of which attain to the dignity of trees.

The Big Laurel or Magnolia (_M. grandiflora_) is an ornamental tree
of the highest rank, extensively planted in parks and gardens of
American cities as far north as Washington, and also grown in Europe.
The wood is suitable for interior finish and is also used for fuel.
The California Laurel (_Umbellularia californica_) and the Madrona
or Madrona Laurel (_Arbutus menziesii_) are Pacific coast species
of beautiful appearance, the strong, heavy, hard woods of which are
of economic importance. Professor Sargent considers[58] that the
former is the most valuable interior or cabinet wood produced by the
forests of the Pacific coast. The wood of the Madrona has little or
no place in construction, but its charcoal is used in the manufacture
of gunpowder. The wood of the Great Laurel or Rose Bay (_Rhododendron
maximum_) has been used as boxwood. The gnarled roots of the Mountain
Laurel or calico bush (_Kalmia latifolia_) are used for rustic
hanging-baskets, seats, and the like.

All of the kinds here noted have evergreen foliage. [p109]

 PERSIMMON.       OSAGE ORANGE.   CHERRY.
 (_Diospyros_.)   (_Maclura_.)    (_Prunus_.)

The Persimmon (_Diospyros virginiana_) grows in many of the central
and southern United States and affords a hard, tough wood, resembling
fine-grain hickory, that is used for implements and other small
work. The plum-like fruit is remarkably astringent when green, but
is sweet, rich, and palatable when ripe. The persimmon is a member
of the ebony family (_Ebenaceae_), and the extremely close-grained
heartwood is almost black. The ebony of commerce is derived from
tropical species of this genus.

The Osage Orange or Bois D'Arc (_Maclura aurantiaca_) is found in the
Gulf and neighboring States, and has been cultivated in the North.
The wood is unusually hard and strong, and is of a yellow color,
which, however, darkens with age. It is in many ways a unique and
serviceable product, widely utilized locally in the South, but almost
unknown in the North, and nowhere sufficiently appreciated. The
aborigines made bows and arrows of it, whence the name Bois D'Arc.
The tree affords a useless fruit somewhat resembling the common
orange in appearance.

The widely distributed Wild Cherry or Wild Black Cherry (_Prunus
serotina_) supplies the cherry wood of commerce. This wood is
strong, hard, fine-grained, red-colored, and one of the most popular
decorative woods of the American forests. Sweet or Cherry Birch
(_Betula lenta_) is often stained so as to imitate it, while it
of itself is stained so as to resemble mahogany. The wood of the
cultivated cherry is not used in the United States. The wild cherry
bears purplish-black fruit somewhat larger than peas, sweetly bitter
when ripe. The bark is also bitter. It should be noted of these woods
that the thin heart of the persimmon is black, that of the Bois
d'Arc is yellow, and that of the cherry is red. Each receives a high
polish. [p112]

 TEAK.          GREENHEART.
 (_Tectona_.)   (_Nectandra_.)

There are two Teaks; the principal one (_Tectona grandis_), a native
of Asia, has been called the "Oak" of the Indian forests, the other
(_Oldfieldia africana_) is an African tree.[60] The Greenheart
(_Nectandra rodiali_) is of the laurel family and grows in South
America. The woods, although foreign, are of such nature as to have
widely established reputations, and each has at some time been used
in construction.

Teak suggests oak, save that it is lighter and has a more uniform
structure. It is very durable, and an oily secretion repels insects
and preserves iron fastenings. During the supremacy of wooden vessels
it was regarded as one of the best ship-building woods in existence.
The grain fits it for carvings, and it is now known in North America
chiefly because of this fact. Indian teak is the wood usually
referred to.

Greenheart was early placed among the first class of ship-building
woods by Lloyd's Register, and is yet taken to Europe to some extent
for dock-and ship-building and for implements, but is seldom found
and but little known in the United States. It is strong, hard,
durable, and extremely heavy, the latter quality being so pronounced
as to limit its field of usefulness. [p116]


 FOOTNOTE

 [Footnote 60: It was long supposed that African teak was supplied
 by the species Swietenia senegalensis. It is now known that the
 source is Oldfieldia africana, of the family Euphorbiaceae. It is not
 impossible that wood passing as teak may be derived from yet other
 species.]

 MAHOGANY.
 (_Swietenia, Khaya, Soymida, Cedrela, etc._)

There are three principal mahogany trees: the Central American or
true mahogany (_Swietenia mahogani_), the African mahogany (_Khaya
senegalensis_), and the Indian mahogany (_Soymida febrifuga_). There
are also minor species called mahoganies.[61] American mahogany was
originally divided by dealers into Spanish and Honduras wood, the
former from the then Spanish-American possessions. A considerable
supply now comes from Mexico, taking name from port of shipment;
as, Frontera, Laguna, Santa Ana, Tecolutla, Minatitlan, and Tonala,
desirability being much in the order named. The African field is the
latest and probably most important, very large quantities of its wood
being distributed through English markets.

 [Illustration: PLATE 25. MAHOGANY (_Swietenia mahagoni_).
 Two Specimens of Wood.]

Mahogany, placed among the second class of ship-building woods by
Lloyd's Register, was once used to some extent in place of oak in
naval architecture, but is now so greatly valued for decoration as
to be employed for little else, save occasionally the hulls of small
pleasure craft. The decorative value is due to a combination of
beauty, working qualities, and durability. Beauty is influenced by
both grain and warm red color. The latter is generally light, and
although it subsequently darkens, in most cases, to a characteristic
and rich reddish-brown, is usually induced immediately by stains.
The grain is not only beautiful of itself, but is such as to receive
those stains and finishing processes thus demanded. Different
localities produce woods varying in tint and grain. Individual
[p119] trees also differ in desirability. No two are alike.
Beautiful grain effects are often obtained in "crotches" or junctions
between trunk and branch, and such pieces bring high prices.
Mahogany is generally used as a veneer. Layers are glued either to
some central piece or "core" or else to one another. The layers are
arranged so as to cross one another's grain, and results are usually
thought to be more desirable than those obtained from solid wood. Few
woods glue better, and few shrink or distort less when in place.

"Spanish Cedar" (_Cedrela odorata_) is a broadleaf wood, and not a
conifer as is usually supposed. It is nearly related to, and usually
found and cut with, true mahogany. Lindley[62] divides Cedrelecae
into two sub-orders: Swieteniae, including the true mahoganies, and
Cedrelae, with nine genera and twenty-five species distributed over
tropical Asia and America.

Prima vera or white mahogany belongs to Bignoniaceae, which also
includes the catalpas. [p120]

 EUCALYPTUS.
 (_Eucalyptus_.)

These trees, locally known as Stringy-barks, Iron-barks, and
Gum-trees, are natives of Australia and the neighboring islands. Some
of the nearly four hundred species have been widely transplanted,
although none have thus far succeeded in this country outside of
Florida and California.[63] The Blue Gum (_E. globulus_) is the
species commonly referred to when Eucalyptus is mentioned in North
America.

The Eucalypts are noted for their great size, rapid growth, tough,
durable wood, and alleged effect upon health. Size is illustrated by
the species Eucalyptus amygdalina, specimens of which have reached
a height of four hundred and eighty feet and are thus the tallest,
although not the largest, trees known to man. Growth is shown by
specimens of the Eucalyptus gunnii, which have grown in excess of
two feet a month during the first year.[64] The working qualities of
Jarrah, Karri, and Tuart woods (_E. marginata_, _E. diversicolor_,
and _E. gomphocephala_) are such as to cause them to take high rank
in local construction. The first two have been preferred beyond all
other species for paving the streets of London and of Paris. Some
improvement in health is said to have followed the introduction of
the Blue Gum (_Eucalyptus globulus_) in malarial districts, such
as those around Rome. It is not certain whether these results are
due to the presence of essences in the foliage, although medicinal
properties are ascribed to them and they are used in the preparation
of listerine and similar compounds, or [p124] whether they are due
to the fact that the leaves evaporate unusual quantities of water
drawn by the roots from the soil.[65]

The trees are characterized by leathery evergreen foliage of many
shades, such as blue, gray, and green. The leaves of young and old
trees differ widely in some species. Those of young blue gums are
bright blue, oval, and stalkless, while leaves of older trees have
stems, are dark green and sickle-shaped. The characteristic odor is
the only point in common between the foliage of the old and young
of this species. There are, as stated, nearly four hundred species.

 NEEDLELEAF WOODS.

The trees affording these woods cover large areas in the natural
forests of the Northern Hemisphere. They exist, but to an unimportant
extent, in the South. Cedar, larch, and cypress figure in ancient
history, but woods generally were not employed until recent
times.[71] Pine, spruce, hemlock, and other so-called soft woods are
of this group.

Needle-leaved woods are characterized by uniform fibre-conditions,
presence of resins, and lighter weights. The vertical structure
consists of simple, similar, elongated tubes or cells, tapering and
finally closing at their ends, known as tracheids. These are arranged
with more or less regularity, and woods are correspondingly easy to
work. Pith-rays are scarcely visible, and sections do not show pores.
Cavities known as resin-ducts, and which are not real vessels but
rather simple intercellular spaces, secrete resins so important in
making these woods durable and elastic. Trees afford large, straight
pieces. Woods are used in carpentry and heavy constructions. The
total requirement greatly exceeds that for hard woods.

The resinous, usually evergreen, leaves and the cones are sufficient
to identify these trees. Needleleaf, softwood, conifer, and evergreen
trees are the same. [p130]


 FOOTNOTE

 [Footnote 71: See Oak, pages 11 _et seq._ The woods have always been
 important in the United States.]


 PINE.
 (_Pinus_.)

These trees were not regarded seriously until about the latter half
of the eighteenth century. Their woods are now the principal ones
in carpentry and construction, and are more used than any others.
They are to the soft woods what the oaks are to the hard woods, and
they stand at present with reference to all woods much as iron does
to all metals. Pine is prized because of a combination of strength,
elasticity, light weight, working qualities, and availability, such
as fits it for those constructions requiring the largest quantities
of wood.

The pines have smooth, straight, solid trunks, usually destitute of
branches for many feet from the ground. There are needle-shaped,
more or less cylindrical, evergreen leaves from one to many inches
in length, gathered in clusters of two, three, or five, their number
and the fact that they are thus clustered being important bases of
classification. There are also cones of woody overlapping scales.
They reproduce with difficulty,[72] and mature so slowly that
ultimate survival of modern conditions must probably be as cultivated
trees.

Thirty-nine of the seventy known species of pine are found in the
United States. These with their woods are separated into two groups
known as _hard_ and _soft_ pines. The Dantzic or Northern pine
(_Pinus silvestris_) is the principal European species. [p131]


 FOOTNOTE

 [Footnote 72: The roots of most species die with cutting of trees.
 There is no power of producing new shoots. (The pitch pine (_Pinus
 rigida_) is an exception to this rule.) Seeds also have short-lived
 vitality. Trees are easily raised from fresh seeds.]


 SOFT PINE.

Soft pine is soft, clean, light, uniform, easily worked, not strong,
free from knots and resins, and obtainable in large and perfect
pieces. The wood is whitish and the yearly rings are not pronounced.
The supply is divided, as obtained from the white pine on the one
hand, and from the sugar-pine and all other species on the other.

White pine (_Pinus strobus_) grows in the north, central, and eastern
United States and was formerly the important tree of North America.
It emphasized the forest industries of Maine and of Michigan,
and methods connected with harvesting it have influenced logging
practices in many fields. It was long the only softwood seriously
considered by Northern lumbermen. Thirty per cent of the sawn
timber and lumber used in this country in 1899 was drawn from this
species.[73] White pine is diminishing so rapidly as to be already
practically unobtainable in many places.

The Sugar Pine (_Pinus lambertiana_) of the Western States is a tree
growing at high elevations and is so large as to take rank with the
redwoods and other of the world's greatest trees. Some material is
derived from the Western white pine (_Pinus flexilis_) and one or
more minor species. Sugar pine resembles, but is not as desirable as,
white pine. The sweetish exudations from this tree are sometimes used
in medicine. [p132]

 HARD PINE.

Hard pine differs from soft pine in that it is hard, resinous, heavy,
harder to work, and very strong. It also is obtainable in large
pieces. The orange-yellow wood is more or less figured. The annual
deposits are pronounced and are separated into two sharply divided
rings. The supply is chiefly derived from the longleaf, shortleaf,
Cuban, and loblolly pines of the South Atlantic States.

The longleaf pine (_Pinus palustris_) is distinctly the most
important of its group. The wood is ideal for heavy constructions.
Beams, docks, trestles, and frames of cars are formed of it. The
trees afford the greater bulk of turpentine, tar, and resin, or
"naval stores," produced in this country.[74] Cuban, shortleaf, and
loblolly pine woods (_P. heterophylla_, _P. echinata_, and _P. taeda_)
are nearly similar. Longleaf and Cuban pines are seldom separated,
while shortleaf and loblolly pines are also mixed. Longleaf pine
usually affords finer structure and more heartwood than Cuban pine.
Strength and weight averages of both woods are in excess of those
of shortleaf and loblolly pines. No method of invariably telling
these four woods apart has as yet been determined. (Roth.) Any or
all of them are practically liable to be delivered in response to a
demand for Southern pine. Johnson considers shortleaf pine as good as
longleaf pine of equal weight, and suggests environment as a means of
identification.

Palustris, signifying "swampy," is misleading, since long leaf pine
prefers dry, sandy soil and tracts known as "pine barrens." _Mitis_
refers to the soft, delicate foliage of shortleaf pine. _Taeda_
signifies "torch." The trees may be told by differences in their
leaves and cones. [p133]

A confusion exists in the naming of the pines. American white pine
is known as yellow or Weymouth pine in Europe, and all American hard
pines are there often known as pitch pines. The European, Dantzic,
or Northern pine has also many names, principally depending on port
of shipment. Georgia, Southern, Yellow, Hard, and even Pitch pine,
are interchangeable names in this country. The species palustris has
thirty local names. [p134]

 KAURI PINE.
 (_Dammara_.)

This New Zealand tree affords one of the best substitutes for
northern pine. Although not true pine, it belongs to the same family
as the pine and other conifers. The light, strong, durable, elastic
wood is obtainable in large-sized pieces suitable for masts.

The species is universally noted for its resin, which possesses the
quality of uniting more perfectly than others with linseed oil.[82]
Kauri gum is thus one of the most valuable constituents of good
varnish.[83] The best gum occurs as a fossil, and is collected by
digging over areas known to be fruitful but from which trees have
long since disappeared. The pieces, varying in size from small
pebbles to lumps as large as eggs, are scraped and otherwise cleansed
by natives in the fields.[84] [p147]

 SPRUCE.
 (_Picea_.)

The spruces form forests in Europe and North America. The black
spruce (_P. nigra_) and the white spruce (_P. alba_) predominate
in eastern United States, while the white spruce (_P. engelmanni_)
is important in the West. The Norway spruce, or white fir (_P.
excelsa_), is the chief European species. American trees prefer
Northern ranges characterized by short summers and long winters.

The soft, light, clean woods resemble and are probably the best
substitute for soft pine. They are apt to warp and twist in seasoning
and so are not good for posts and trusses. Spruce is the principal
wood in New England for studding and floor-joists. The product is
divided commercially and according to appearance, but irrespective of
species, into white and black spruce. These terms depend sometimes,
at least, on the wide and narrow rings of the black spruce (_P.
nigra_). It should be remembered that spruce and fir woods are often
confused with one another, and that there are trees, as the Douglas
spruce and Kauri pine or spruce, that are called, but are not, true
spruces. European spruce is often locally known as white deal.

Spruce trees have single, sharp-pointed, short leaves, pointing
everywhere, and keeled above and below so as to appear four-sided;
the cones hang down. Spruce may be distinguished from the pines,
firs, and hemlocks by the fact that pine leaves are longer and in
clusters, that hemlock leaves are flat, blunt, and two-ranked, and
that fir cones point upward. The genus picea has twelve species, five
of which are North American. The resins of the black and red spruce
are used as confections. [p149]

 [Illustration: PLATE 29. BLACK SPRUCE (_Picea nigra_).]

The following table sets forth the primary distinctions between the
spruces and the pines, firs, and hemlocks:

 FOOTNOTE

 It is often difficult to distinguish between black and white spruce
 trees. The foliage of the former is darker as a whole, and there
 are differences in shape and persistence of cones. The names double
 spruce and single spruce are without evident foundation. Woods
 exhibit similar qualities and are classed together by lumbermen. Red
 Spruce (_Picea rubens_) resembles, and is sometimes considered a
 variety of, black spruce.

 DOUGLAS SPRUCE.
 (_Pseudotsuga_.)

The Douglas or Red Pine, Spruce, or Fir, of the Pacific coast is
neither true pine, spruce, nor fir, but a sort of bastard hemlock.
The name "pseudotsuga" is from _pseudo_, or false, and _tsuga_, or
hemlock. The trees are among the greatest known. The wood resembles
larch or hard pine in properties, appearance, and applications. Trees
have been successfully planted in the Adirondacks. The species was
earlier classed as Pinus taxifolia and as Abies taxifolia. [p155]

 FIR.
 (_Abies_.)

Several of the fir-trees of the western United States attain to
very great size. The silver fir (_Abies grandis_) and the white fir
(_Abies concolor_) supply much wood in the section in which they
grow. The balsam fir (_Abies balsamea_) of the Eastern States is of
some commercial importance.

Fir wood resembles spruce in appearance and in structural qualities.
It may be told from spruce as well as from pine and larch by the fact
that fir has no resin-ducts. The balsam fir is distinguishable by
clear liquid resin which appears in blisters in the bark. The coarse,
weak wood is cleaner than the bark would indicate. Spruce and fir
woods are often confused in the United States, while pine, spruce,
and fir are similarly confounded in Europe.

 HEMLOCK.
 (_Tsuga_.)

The hemlocks are distributed over northern United States from Maine
to Michigan, in the Rocky Mountains, and on the Pacific coast. They
generally mingle with broad-leaved and other needle-leaved species,
but occasionally form pure forests by themselves.

The wood is coarse, often crossed-grained, perishable, brittle,
liable to wind-shakes, hard to work, and apt to warp and splinter. It
holds nails firmly and is used for coarse lumber, dimension pieces,
paper-pulp, and latterly for cheap finish. It should not be relied
upon to receive shocks. The bark is used in tanning.

Hemlock trees may be known by their blunt, flat, evergreen leaves,
appearing two-ranked and whitened beneath (see foot-note under
Spruce). Red inner bark. [p163]

 LARCH. TAMARACK.
 (_Larix_.)

Larch was well known in the older time, and was prized in Europe
and the Orient. The two principal American species are also called
tamarack and hackmatack. The Eastern larch or tamarack (_L.
americana_) prefers peculiar low, wet areas known as tamarack swamps.
The Western tree (_L. occidentalis_) resembles the European species
and prefers dry places.

Larch wood has always been regarded as very durable. It is noted by
Pliny and other ancient authors.[88] Vitruvius mentions a bridge
that, having burned, was replaced by one of larch, because that wood
would not burn as readily.[89] The foundation-piles of Venice are
said to be of larch.[90] It should be remembered that the identities
of ancient woods are not always beyond question. American larch
resembles, if it does not equal, true foreign wood. The trees are
tall and straight, but so slender as to be seldom cut into lumber,
almost the entire supply being demanded for posts, ties, and poles.
The exceedingly durable wood resembles spruce in structure, and hard
pine in weight and appearance.

Larch trees are marked by the fact that their foliage is deciduous.
The little leaves, gathered in tufts or bundles, are of a bright
pea-green when fresh in the springtime. The appearance of tamarack
trees when divested of foliage in the winter is very gloomy.

 CEDAR.
 (_Cedrus, Thuya, Chamaecyparis, Libocedrus, Juniperus_.)

Cedar was a name first applied to the true or Lebanon cedars
(_Cedrus_) of the Eastern continent, but later to certain Arborvitaes
(_Thuya_), Junipers (_Juniperus_), and Cypresses (_Chamaecyparis_),
and other trees (see "Spanish Cedar," page 122) from which durable,
fine-grained, more or less fragrant woods, known as cedar, are
obtained. Cedar was highly prized by the ancients, who employed it in
costly constructions, such as the temples of Solomon and of Diana at
Ephesus.[91][92] Woods known as cedar are divided into so-called Red
and White Cedars.

Red Cedar is very fine-grained, soft, light, durable, fragrant, and
of a pinkish-red color. Much wood is derived from the Red Cedars,
_Juniperus virginiana_, _Juniperus scopulorum_, and _Juniperus
barbadensis_, of the Eastern, Western, and Southern States
respectively. Although seen in construction, red cedar is chiefly
used in chests, closets, lead-pencils, and cigar-boxes. One hundred
and twenty-five thousand trees (125,000)[93] are annually required
for lead-pencils alone. The waste is often converted into shavings
and used instead of camphor to protect woolens. The demand is greater
than the supply. Trees are easily grown on almost any soil. Trees
and wood are subject to fungus diseases which apparently cease after
trees have been felled; the wood is then durable.[94]

White Cedar is best defined as all cedar that is not "red cedar,"
[p168] and is obtained from several valuable trees.[95] The
arborvitaes (_T. occidentalis_) vary in size from large bushes used
in hedging and ornamentation to small-sized trees gathered for wood.
They are most vigorous on cold, wet areas known as cedar swamps.[96]
The giant arborvitae (_T. gigantea_), noted for its great girth, and
the yellow and Lawson Cypresses, are important Pacific coast species.
The incense cedar, while much subject to fungus trouble, is also
prized.[97] White cedar wood is durable, plentiful, and employed in
exposed positions as ties and shingles.

Arborvitaes (_Thuya_) have very small overlapping leaves that form
flat rods or fan-like sprays. The cones are oblong, less than
one-half inch in length, and all of their six or eight scales
separate or open when ripe. The cypresses (_Chamaecyparis_) exhibit
similar foliage, but their tiny cones are simple, roughened, close,
or solid globules. The Junipers (_Juniperus_) often, but not always,
bear bluish-black berries powdered with a whitish-blue bloom. The
true cedars (_Cedrus_) differ from the others in that they have
simple needle leaves, an inch, more or less, in length, together with
cones erect and several inches in length. The Deodar or cedar of
India is of this genus. The principal American red and white cedars
are as follows:

 Red Cedar.
 Red Cedar (_Juniperus virginiana_).
 Red Cedar (_Juniperus scopulorum_).
 Red Cedar (_Juniperus barbadensis_).

 Spanish Cedar. (See page 99.)

 CYPRESS.
 (_Cupressus and Taxodium_.)

The name cypress has been chiefly applied to trees of the genera
Chamaecyparis, Cupressus, and Taxodium. Most species of the genus
Chamaecyparis are now called cedars (see page 167). The Cupressus,
while true cypresses and important in Europe, have no significance in
America. The single species of the genus Taxodium is not a cypress,
but supplies the "cypress" wood of American commerce. It is perhaps
best to confine the name cypress to the true cypress (_Cupressus_)
and to the commercial cypress (_Taxodium_).

The true cypress (_Cupressus_) was once important in the East, and
is thought by some to have given the gopher wood of which the Ark
was built.[98] Pliny mentions cypress doors good after four hundred
years, and a statue good after six hundred years. Herodotus and
other ancient authors[99] speak of it. Authorities in the middle
ages thought that it would never decay. The cypress gates of the
early St. Peter's, removed after one thousand years of service,
were found to be in perfect condition.[100] Cypress was much prized
for mummy-cases. Living trees long figured as funeral emblems, and
are yet planted over graves in Italy and Turkey.[101] The common
or evergreen cypress is the chief European species. The eight or
nine American representatives are of little note save as they are
sometimes used for hedges and ornamentation. The Monterey and Gowan
cypresses (_Cupressus macrocarpa_ and _Cupressus goveniana_) are thus
employed. There are small evergreen scale-like leaves. [p178]

 [Illustration: BALD CYPRESS (_Taxodium distichum_).]

The American or Bald Cypress (_Taxodium distichum_) is a tree of
considerable importance. It grows in the South Atlantic and Gulf
States, on submerged lands or in deep swamps where unusual logging
methods are necessitated. The seasoned wood resembles white cedar in
that it is soft, light, and very durable. It has been called by many
names. Pieces were once called black or white cypress according as
they sank or floated. All dark pieces are now called black cypress.
The tinted woods of some localities are called red or yellow cypress.
The name bald cypress was caused by the leafless appearance of the
trees in winter. The living trees are subject to a peculiar fungous
disease, causing numerous cavities in the wood. These so resemble
perforations made by small pegs that the wood is termed "peggy." The
trouble ceases as the trees are cut, and the wood is then as durable
as that from perfect trees. About one third of the standing supply
is thus affected.[102] The roots frequently project upward above
the surface in what are known as cypress knees. The single species
of this genus may easily be recognized by its deciduous foliage;
the little leaves are separated and are not in tufts as with the
tamaracks. [p179]

 REDWOOD.
 (_Sequoia_.)

These trees grow only in California. There are two species: the
common redwood (_S. sempervirens_), noted for its lumber, and the
big or mammoth tree (_S. washingtoniana_), so remarkable for its
great size. Geological evidence indicates that the genus was once
represented by many species on both hemispheres, but that all
disappeared during the glacial period save the two here noted.

The common redwood is a large and perfect tree and supplies a wood
suggesting good red cedar. This soft, light, clean, reddish-brown,
durable wood works and stands well, is not easily inflamed, and is
obtainable in large-sized pieces for use in large constructions.
Coffins and shingles are made of it, also large quantities of wooden
water-pipe employed for irrigation purposes. The average wood is seen
in cheaper forms of indoor finish, while occasional pieces, in which
the grain is distorted, are classed as curly redwood and used for
costlier decorations.

Big or Mammoth trees have been measured up to three hundred and
twenty feet in height and thirty-five feet in diameter (Sargent).
They are thus the largest of American trees and the most massive,
although not the tallest, of all trees. Specimens twenty-five feet
in diameter have been estimated as thirty-six hundred years old,
and it is thought that under favorable conditions trees can survive
for five thousand years, or even longer. The oldest trees are sound
throughout. The almost incombustible bark is nearly two feet in
thickness; the wood is brittle, but otherwise resembles ordinary
redwood. It should be noted that large exceptional trees are all
known, and that most of them have names such as the "Pride of the
Forest," the "Grizzly Giant," and the "U. S. Grant." These, with
younger trees, are grouped in [p181] the Mariposa, Calavaras, and
other groves. Many sawmills are unfortunately engaged on the trees of
this species.

 ENDOGENOUS TREES.
 (_Monocotyledons_.)


Endogenous trees are those that increase from within. Their elemental
parts are similar to those of exogenous trees but the arrangement
of such parts differs in that the newer fibres of the Endogen
intermingle with the old, pass through a pith-like tissue, and cause
cross-surfaces to appear as dotted, whereas the new material of the
Exogen is deposited altogether and upon the outside of the old, their
sections exhibiting rings or layers. The Palms, Yuccas, Cornstalks,
and Bamboos are of the endogens. Bark is unusual on trees of the
series.

Endogenous woods are hardest and most compact at circumferences. The
stems of palm trees are solid, but those of some of the grasses,
particularly those that grow quickly, are hollow.[107] The tube or
canal, when existing, is due to sluggishness on the part of the
central pith, which, developing more slowly than the outer tissues,
finally ruptures and disappears at the center. There are also more or
less permanent joints or knots,[108] such as are made familiar by the
canes and bamboos. The stems of Endogenous plants are seldom cut up
into lumber, but are used in segments, or else entire, as for troughs
or piles.[109] The use of Palm wood must be more or less [p184]
limited to the neighborhoods in which such trees flourish, but it is
probable that the Bamboo can be much more generally employed.

The Endogens include numerous families and many thousand
species.[110] The grasses, including wheat, rye, and Indian corn at
the North and sugar-cane and bamboo at the South, belong to this
group. Most Endogens are herbs; comparatively few furnish material
for structural purposes. The Palms, including the palmetto, rattans,
cane palms, and others, the Yucca, including the Joshua tree, Spanish
bayonet, and others, and the Bamboos, representatives of the grasses,
are thus useful. Endogens are also known as Monocotyledons. [p185]


 FOOTNOTES

 [Footnote 107: The Bamboo, which is a grass, is hollow, while the
 cornstalk, which is also a grass, is not.]

 [Footnote 108: The knots of endogens correspond to the nodes of
 exogens. Spaces between the nodes, known as internodes, mark the
 annual lengthening. Knots are places whence leaves have emerged.]

 [Footnote 109: Palm in marine work appears to repel the teredoe.
 This is probably because of the porous character of the wood. See
 "Marine Wood Borers," Trans. Am. Soc. C. E., Vol. XL, pages 195 and
 204.]

 [Footnote 110: Bastin ("College Botany," p. 379) divides into about
 fifty natural orders distributed among seven divisions. Warming
 ("Systematic Botany," pp. 277, 278) divides into seven families
 corresponding with Bastin's seven divisions. A. Gray divides into
 twenty-one orders or families. Coulter ("Plants," p. 237) divides
 into forty families, including twenty thousand species.]

 PALM.
 PALMACEAE.

This is one of the largest and most important orders of plants known
to man. The one thousand[111] or more known species are distributed
over the tropical and semitropical regions of the entire world. Only
a few species, including the palmettos of the Gulf States and the fan
palms of California are native in the United States.

Palms have tall, columnar trunks without branches, but with crowns of
large leaves at their summits. Their forms and proportions are often
magnificent. The wood is soft, light, more or less porous, difficult
to work, and not strong. The shapes of trunks sometimes cause them
to be locally prized for piles, while the porous qualities of the
wood are such as to repel teredo.[112] There are many by-products,
as fruit, nuts, oil, etc. The rattan or cane palms of India and the
Malayan Islands sometimes grow to a height of two hundred feet and
are imported into Europe and America for chair-bottoms and the like.

Sudworth[113] enumerates the following as attaining to the dignity of
trees in the United States:

 Cabbage Palmetto (_Sabal palmetto_).
 Silvertop Palmetto (_Thrinax microcarpa_).
 Silktop Palmetto (_Thrinax parviflora_).
 Mexican palmetto (_Sabal mexicana_).
 Sargent Palm (_Pseudoph[oe]nix sargentii_).

 YUCCA.
 (_Yucca_.)

The eighteen species constituting this genus are all American. Twelve
of them are found in the southern and western United States, and
eight of these are mentioned by Sudworth[114] as arborescent. Several
of the Yuccas are cultivated because of their beautiful lily-like
flowers. The Tree Yucca or Joshua-tree affords wood.

This last named species produces a short stout trunk, peculiar in
that it is covered by thick bark. The soft, spongy wood is sometimes
sawn into lumber, made into souvenirs and lately into artificial
limbs. An attempt to manufacture it into paper-pulp[115] is said
to have failed because of high cost made necessary by the remote
position of the industry. Hough notes[116] that trees are sometimes
attacked by borers that impregnate the walls of their tunnels with
hardening antiseptic solutions, causing such parts to remain after
the disappearance of the others. And that these parts are described
as "petrified wood," and are prized for fuel since they burn with
"little smoke and great heat."

The eight species noted by Sudworth are as follows:

 Yucca arborescens (Joshua tree).
 Yucca treculeana (Spanish Bayonet).
 Yucca gloriosa (Spanish Dagger).
 Yucca mohavensis (Mohave Yucca).
 Yucca aloifolia (Aloe-leaf Yucca).

 BAMBOO.
 (_Bambusae_.)

The bamboos are giant members of a group (grasses[118]), the other
individuals of which, while widely distributed, valued, and very
numerous, are for the most part insignificant as to bulk, height,
and structural characteristics. The canes and bamboos are exceptions
in that they form what may well be called forests, and produce woods
used in construction. The Bamboos (_Bambusae_), including about twenty
genera and two hundred species,[119] are distributed unevenly over
the tropical zone.

 [Illustration: PLATE 39. BAMBOO (_Bambusae_).
 Bamboo Grove, Philippines.

 Bamboo Grove, China.
 Bamboo sections, 5-1/4 inches diameter.]

The bamboo plant with its numerous stalks and delicate foliage
resembles a plume of giant ostrich feathers. The stems attain heights
of seventy feet and diameters of four and six inches (see Fig. 3
plate). Knots or joints are at first close together, but are later
one or two feet apart. Growth is surprisingly rapid. A Philippine
specimen, which when measured was eighteen inches high and four
inches in diameter, grew two feet in three days.[120] Florida stalks
have reached heights of seventy-two feet in a single season.[121] The
plants are apt to take complete possession of the ground on which
they grow. Those who use bamboo value it highly. It is employed
entire or else split into segments. Some can be [p191] opened
and flattened into rough boards, splitting everywhere but holding
together.[122] For vessels it is cut off with reference to the
partitions. The subject is thus summarized by Dr. Martin:[123] "The
Chinese make masts of it for their small junks, and twist it into
cables for their larger ones. They weave it into matting for floors,
and make it into rafters for roofs. They sit at table on bamboo
chairs, eat shoots of bamboo with bamboo chop-sticks. The musician
blows a bamboo flute, and the watchman beats a bamboo rattle.
Criminals are confined in a bamboo cage and beaten with bamboo rods.
Paper is made of bamboo fibre, and pencils of a joint of bamboo in
which is inserted a tuft of goat's hair."

The manipulation of this valuable material is not yet understood in
America. Prof. Johnson notes[124] that the wood of "bamboo is just
twice as strong as the strongest wood in cross-bending, weight for
weight, when the wood is taken in specimens, with a square and solid
cross-section." Dr. Fernow considers the bamboo worthy of extensive
trial throughout the Gulf region.[125] [p192]


 FOOTNOTES

 [Footnote 118: Grasses, "one of the largest and probably one of
 the most useful groups of plants. . . . If grass-like sedges be
 associated, . . . there are about 6000 species, representing
 nearly one third of the Monocotyledons." (Coulter, "Plants," pp.
 240-241.) The various pasture-grasses, cereals, and sugar-canes are
 here included. Bamboos and canes are distinct in that they afford
 structural materials.]

Transcriber's note:

Original spelling and grammar have usually been retained.

Each footnote has been moved from the bottom of a page to the end of
its section.

Illustrations have been moved from within paragraphs to nearby
locations between paragraphs.

Plates were originally printed on unnumbered pages and followed by a
blank page.

Pages 26 and 116: the name "Laslett", retained, probably refers to
"Lazlett".

Page 35: Some paragraphs of the original printed book appear to be
footnotes, but lack an anchor in the text. For example, the one on
page 35 is likely a general reference for the Genus Ulmus (Elm).
Pages 123-124 contain a particularly interesting example. This
Chapter on Eucalyptus contains five footnote paragraphs. The third
and fifth are not anchored. It may be that either: (1) the third
paragraph was meant to be part of the second footnote, or (2) the
third paragraph was meant to be a general reference for Eucalyptus,
or (3) the anchor for the third paragraph was simply not printed
due to typographical error. Since such ambiguity is rather common
in this book, the footnote paragraphs, both anchored and not, have
been retained in the order printed, but relocated to the end of the
immediate containing section.

Page 57: "chrysaphylla" changed to "chrysophylla".

Page 60: the original second footnote, " * Keeler notes experiments
made to prove resistance on part of beechwood." had no anchor in the
text, and in the 1908 edition (the Second Edition, First Thousand),
this footnote was omitted entirely from the corresponding chapter.
Herein, it is retained.

Page 64: "virginina" changed to "virginiana".

Page 88: the names "Salix babylonica", and "Salix babylonica" (the
latter in the index), are both retained. There are several other
retained instances of spelling inconsistencies in the use of accents,
or "ae-ligature" versus "ae".

Page 120: "Santa Anna" on page 120 and "Santa Ana" on page 118 are
both retained.

Pages 133, 149: these two data tables were recast in a different
shape to achieve shorter line length.

Page 168: The table says "Spanish Cedar. (See page 99.)". This may be
a misprint, referring to page 119.

Page 198: Index entry "_Nectanara_, 115" changed to "_Nectandra_,
115". Also, "_Negunao_" to "_Negundo_".

Page 201: "Caliofrnia" (under "Sassafras") to "Californian".

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
