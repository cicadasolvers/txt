SUPPLEMENTAL CHARTER,
9th September, 1884.


Victoria, by the grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Ireland Queen, Defender of the Faith, Empress of India, to all to
whom these presents shall come, greeting.

_Whereas by a Royal charter granted on the 2nd day of May in the
two-and-twentieth year of the reign of his late Majesty King Charles
the Second (in this our charter called "the original charter"), a
company was incorporated by the name of "The Governor and Company of
Adventurers of England trading into Hudson's Bay" with a common seal,
for the purpose of trading within the territories mentioned in said
original charter:

And whereas by the said original charter, after declaring that one of
the Company should be elected in manner thereafter mentioned, to be
called the Governor of the Company, and that the said Governor and
Company should or might elect seven of their members in such form as
thereafter mentioned, to be called the Committee of the Company, which
Committee of seven or any three of them, together with the Governor
or the Deputy-Governor for the time being, should have the general
management of the affairs of the Company, it was declared that the
Governor and Company and their successors should from thenceforth for
ever be ruled, ordered, and governed according to such manner and form
as was thereafter expressed, and not otherwise:

And whereas by the said original charter, after appointing Prince
Rupert to be the first Governor of the Company, and seven persons to
be the seven first Committees of the Company, it was provided that
it should and might be lawful to or for the said Governor and Company
for the time being or the greater part of them at any public assembly,
commonly called the Court General, to be holden for the said Company,
the Governor of the said Company being always one from time to time,
to elect, nominate, and appoint one of the said Company to be Deputy to
the said Governor, which Deputy should take a corporal oath before the
Governor and three or more of the Committee of the said Company for the
time being, well and truly and faithfully to execute his said office
of Deputy to the Governor of the said Company, and after his oath so
taken should and might from time to time, in the absence of the said
Governor, exercise and execute the office of Governor of the said
Company in such sort as the said Governor ought to do:

And whereas the said original charter similarly provided for the election
in each and every year between the first and last day of November of one
of the Company to be Governor for one whole year then next following,
and required the Governor or Deputy-Governor for the time being to be
present at each such election, and required the person so elected to
be Governor of the Company, before being admitted to execute his office,
to take a corporal oath before the last Governor being his predecessor,
or his Deputy, and any three or more of the Committee of the said
Company for the time being, that he would well and truly execute the
office of Governor:

And whereas the said original charter similarly provided for the election
in each and every year between the first and last day of November of
seven of the Company to be a Committee of the Company for one whole year
then next ensuing, and required the Governor or the Deputy-Governor of
the Company for the time being to be present at each, such election,
and required the persons so elected to be a Committee of the Company,
before being admitted to execute their office to take a corporal oath
that they and every of them should well and faithfully perform their
office of Committee.

And whereas the said original charter similarly provided for the
election of a Governor or a Deputy-Governor of the Company in the
event of the Governor or Deputy-Governor for the time being, at any
time within one year after being elected and sworn to the office of
Governor or Deputy-Governor, dying or being removed from his office
(which Governor or Deputy-Governor not demeaning himself well in his
office was to be removeable at the pleasure of the rest of the Company
or the greater part of them present at a general court), and provided
that the Governor or Deputy-Governor so elected should hold office for
the residue of the said year, and before being admitted to execute his
office should take a corporal oath as aforesaid:

And whereas the said original charter similarly provided in the event
of any person or persons of the Committee of the Company for the time
being within one year after being elected and sworn to such office
dying or being removed from his or their office (which Committee not
demeaning themselves well in their said office were to be removeable at
the pleasure of the Governor and Company or the greater part of them,
whereof the Governor for the time being, or his deputy should be one),
for the election of one or more of the Company to be of the Committee
in the place of him or them dying or being removed as aforesaid,
and the said original charter provided that the person or persons
so elected should hold office for the residue of the said year, and
before being admitted to execute the office of Committee should take
a corporal oath as aforesaid, and the Governor or the Deputy-Governor
for the time being was required to be present at each such election.

And whereas by the said original charter the Governor and Company were
empowered to assemble themselves and hold court for the Company and
the affairs thereof, and it was thereby declared that it should be
lawful for them and the greater part of them present at such assembly,
whereof the Governor or his Deputy for the time being should be one,
to make, ordain, and constitute such and so many laws, constitutions,
orders, and ordinances as to them or the greater part of them being there
present should seem necessary and convenient for the good government
of the Company, and at their pleasure to revoke and alter the same or
any of them as the occasion should require:

And whereas by the said original charter the Governor or Deputy-Governor
for the time being was required to be present at the admission into
the Company of servants, factors, and other persons:

And whereas by the said original charter it was declared that it should
be lawful in all elections and bye-laws to be made by the general court
of the Adventurers of the said Company, that every person should have
a number of votes according to his stock, that was to say, for every
hundred pounds by him subscribed or brought into the present stock one
vote, and that any of those who had subscribed less than one hundred
pounds might join their respective sums to make up one hundred pounds
and have one vote jointly for the same, and not otherwise:

And whereas by a deed under the seal of the Company, dated the nineteenth
November, One thousand eight hundred and sixty-nine, certain rights of
government and other rights and privileges granted, by the said original
charter, but not affecting the subject matter of this our charter,
were duly surrendered to Her Majesty, and such surrender was duly
accepted by Her Majesty by an instrument under her sign manual:

And whereas for many years the capital of the Company has comprised no
stock, but has been and is now divided into shares of equal value, and
it is desirable that the qualification for votes should be changed from
the holding of stock in the Company to the holding of shares therein:

And whereas many of the provisions contained in the original charter have
been found very inconvenient in practice, and are not in accordance with
the usual provisions regulating the affairs of modern companies, and in
particular the following provisions have been found very inconvenient,
that is to say: the provisions requiring the Governor, Deputy-Governor,
and Committee to be elected every year, and fixing the date of the
election between the first and last day of November; the provisions
requiring the presence of the Governor or Deputy-Governor at the general
courts for the elections of Governors or Members of the Committee, and at
the general courts assembled for the purpose of making bye-laws, and on
other occasions specified in the said original charter; the provisions
requiring a corporal oath to be taken by the Governor, Deputy-Governor,
and Committee, and by certain other persons on certain occasions.

And whereas, in addition to the above provisions complained of, the
absence of any power in the said original charter enabling the Governor,
Deputy-Governor, or any member of the Committee, to resign office, or
enabling votes to be taken by proxy, and the absence of several other
powers usually given to trading companies for the better regulation
of their internal affairs, has been found in practice to be very
inconvenient and detrimental to the interests of the Company.

And whereas the Company is desirous that the provisions in the original
charter above complained of should be cancelled or modified, and
has applied to us for a supplemental charter embodying more suitable
provisions._

Now know ye that We by these presents do will and ordain that the
several provisions contained in the said original charter relating to
the election to the office of Governor, Deputy-Governor, or Committee,
and to the filling up of any vacancy in any such office, and requiring
corporal oaths to be taken, and the other provisions contained in the
said original charter, shall, so far as they are inconsistent with the
provisions contained in this our charter, on and after the day of the
date of this our charter, cease to be in force and be annulled.

And We do hereby further will and ordain that, notwithstanding anything
contained in the original charter, the presence of the Governor or
Deputy-Governor at any general court or at any meeting of the Governor,
Deputy-Governor, and Committee (who are hereinafter collectively referred
to as the Board) shall not be essential for the proper holding of such
court or Board meeting, and that nothing done at any general court or
meeting of the Board shall be questioned or disputed on the ground
of the absence of the Governor or Deputy-Governor from such general
court or meeting of the Board, and that in case neither the Governor
nor Deputy-Governor happen to be present at any such general court or
meeting of the Board, at the appointed time for holding such general
court or meeting of the Board, the members of the Committee present or
the major part of them shall nominate and appoint one of themselves
Chairman or President of such court or Board, and that the general
powers of management and other powers given by the said original charter
to any three members of the Committee, together with the Governor or
Deputy-Governor, shall be exerciseable by any four members of the Board,
whether the Governor or Deputy-Governor shall form one of such four or
not.

And We do hereby further will and ordain that, notwithstanding anything
contained in the original charter, a general court for the Company shall
be held every year at such place and on such day in November or December
as may be appointed by the Board.

And We do hereby further will and ordain that every question submitted
to a general court shall be decided by a show of hands, unless before
or upon the declaration of the result of the show of hands, a poll is
demanded by at least five members present at such general court, and
holding in the aggregate not less than One hundred shares, and unless
a poll is so demanded a declaration by the Chairman that the motion has
been carried or lost, or carried or lost by a particular majority, shall
be deemed conclusive evidence of the fact without proof of the number or
the proportion of the votes recorded in favour of or against the motion,
and that if a poll is demanded as aforesaid, it shall be taken in such
manner and at such time and place and either at once or after an interval
or adjournment, as the Chairman of the general court directs, and the
result of such poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the general
court at which the poll was demanded. In case of an equality of votes,
the Chairman shall, whether on a show of hands or at the poll, have a
casting vote in addition to the vote or votes to which he may be entitled
as a member.

In computing the majority when a poll is demanded, reference shall be
had to the number of votes to which each member is entitled by this our
charter.

And We do hereby further will and ordain that, notwithstanding anything
contained in the original charter, every member of the Company shall
have one vote for every five shares in the Company held by him, and
that any of those members who hold less than five shares may join their
respective shares, so as to make up five or more shares, and have one
vote jointly for the same; provided nevertheless that no member shall
be entitled to vote, or to join with any other member or members in
making up a joint vote at any general Court in respect of any shares
or share, unless he shall have been the holder of such shares or share
for at least six months prior to such general Court.

And We do hereby further will and ordain that votes may be given at
every general court either personally or by proxy, but such proxy must
be a proprietor in the Company, and himself entitled to vote, and the
appointment of every such proxy must be in writing and must be in the
form following or to the like effect, that is to say:

  I (or we) appoint ___ my (our) proxy to vote and act for
  me (us) and in my (our) name (names) on all questions at
  the general court of the Hudson's Bay Company to be held
  on the ___ day of ___ and every adjournment thereof whereat
  I (we) shall not be present in person. Dated this ___ of ___.

And We do hereby further will and ordain that the Chairman may, with
the consent of the meeting, adjourn any general court from time to time
and place to place, but that no business shall be transacted at any
adjourned general court other than the business left unfinished at the
general court from which the adjournment took place.

And We do hereby further will and ordain that, notwithstanding anything
contained in the original charter, the Governor, Deputy-Governor,
and Committeemen shall, after the year One thousand eight hundred
and eighty-four, hold their respective offices subject to retirement
by rotation as hereinafter provided, that is to say, at the general
court to be held in the year One thousand eight hundred and eighty-five,
and at every succeeding general court, three members of the Board shall
retire from office, and that, until all the present Board shall in turn
have retired, the members of the Board to retire shall from time to time
be determined by ballot or otherwise amongst the members of the present
Board, or such of them as for the time being shall not have retired,
but afterwards the members of the Board to retire shall be those who
shall have been longest in office since their last election, and as
between members of the Board of equal seniority the member or members to
retire shall be determined by lot; provided always that the Governor and
Deputy-Governor shall not both retire at the same time, and that in the
ballot for determining who shall retire in the year One thousand eight
hundred and eighty-five, the Governor and Deputy-Governor shall not both
be included, but only one of them, such one to be determined by lot;
and in the event of neither the Governor nor the Deputy-Governor being
selected by ballot to retire in the year One thousand eight hundred and
eighty-five, one of them to be determined by lot shall retire in the
year One thousand eight hundred and eighty-six. And provided always
that a retiring member of the Board shall be eligible for re-election,
and that, if the retiring member be the Governor or Deputy-Governor of
the Company, he shall be eligible for re-election, or any other member of
the Board shall be eligible for election as Governor or Deputy-Governor
respectively; and in the event of any member of the Board being elected to
the office of Governor or Deputy-Governor, in the place of the retiring
Governor or Deputy-Governor such member shall be deemed to have retired
from his former office.

And We do hereby further will and ordain that, notwithstanding anything
contained in the original charter, the Company at any general court at
which any members of the Board retire in manner aforesaid shall if it be
the turn for the Governor or Deputy-Governor to retire first fill up that
office, and then shall fill up the other vacated offices, including any
office rendered vacant by the election of any member of the Board to the
office of Governor or Deputy-Governor as aforesaid, by electing a like
number of persons to be members of the Board; and that every election or
re-election to the office of Governor, Deputy-Governor, or Committee shall
be conducted in the manner and according to the forms from time to time
to be prescribed by the bye-laws of the Company, and that such notice
of the names of every candidate for election or re-election to any such
office shall be given as may be required by the bye-laws for the time
being in force.

And We do hereby further will and ordain that notwithstanding anything
contained in the original charter, any member of the Board may at
any time give notice to the Board in writing of his wish to resign,
and on the acceptance of his resignation by the Board, but not before,
his office shall be vacant.

Nothing in this our charter contained shall affect the power given by the
original charter to the Company to remove any Governor, Deputy-Governor,
or member of the Committee who should not demean himself well in his
respective office.

And We do hereby further will and ordain that, notwithstanding anything
in the original charter contained, any casual vacancy occurring among
the members of the Board through death, resignation, removal, or other
cause, except the expiration of the period of office, may be filled up by
the Board or the remaining members of the Board, whatever there number
may be, and if the casual vacancy occur in the office of Governor or
Deputy-Governor, such vacancy may be filled by electing any one of the
remaining members of the Board; and if so filled up a casual vacancy shall
be deemed to have occurred in the office of the member of the Board so
elected to the office of Governor or Deputy-Governor; provided always that
any person so chosen to fill up any casual vacancy shall retain his office
until the next general court held for the election of members of the
Board, and at such general court the Company shall either confirm such
person in his office or shall elect some other person to hold such office
in his place, and provided always that the person so chosen and confirmed
as aforesaid or the person elected by the Company in his stead (as the
case may be) shall retain his office so long only as the vacating member
of the Board would have retained the same if no vacancy had occurred,
and provided always that, notwithstanding any vacancy in the Board,
the continuing members of the Board may act so long as there remains
not less than four members of the Board.

And We do hereby further will and ordain that, notwithstanding anything
contained in the original charter, the corporal oath thereby required to
be taken on the occasions and by the persons therein mentioned shall no
longer be required to be taken by any person on any occasion whatsoever.

In witness whereof we have caused these our Letters to be made
patent. Witness Ourself at Westminster, the ninth day of September,
in the forty-eighth year of our reign.

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
