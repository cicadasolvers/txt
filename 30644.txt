PALINDROME VERSES.

BOEOTICUS inquires (Vol. vi., p 209.) whence comes the line--

 "Roma tibi subito motibus ibit amor."

In p. 352. of the same volume W. W. T. (quoting from D'Israeli's
_Curiosities of Literature_ a passage which supplies the hexameter
completing the distich, and attributes the verses to Sidonius Apollinaris)
asks where may be found a legend which represents the two lines to have
formed part of a dialogue between the fiend, under the form of a mule, and
a monk, who was his rider. B. H. C., at p. 521. of the same volume, sends a
passage from the _Dictionnaire Litteraire_, giving the complete distich:

 "Signa te, signa, temere me tangis et angis.
  Roma tibi subito motibus ibit amor,"

and attributing it to the devil, but without supplying any more authentic
parentage for the lines. The following Note will contribute a fact or two
to the investigation of the subject; but I shall be obliged to conclude by
reiterating the original Query of BOEOTICUS, Who was the real author of the
lines?

In a little work entitled _A Summer in Brittany_, published by me in 1840,
may be found (at p. 99. of vol. i.) a legend, which relates how one Jean
Patye, canon of Cambremer, in the chapter of Bayeux, rode the devil to
Rome, for the purpose of there chanting the epistle at the midnight mass at
Christmas, according to the tenor of an ancient bond, which obliged the
chapter to send one of their number yearly to Rome for that purpose. This
story I met with in a little volume, entitled _Contes populaires, Prejuges,
Patois, Proverbes de l'Arrondissement de Bayeux, recueillis et publies_,
par F. Pluquet, the frontispiece of which consists of a sufficiently
graphic representation of the worthy canon's feat. Pluquet concludes his
narrative by stating that--

    "Etienne Tabourot dans ses _Bigarrures_, publiees sous le nom du
    _Seigneur des Accords_, rapporte que c'est a Saint Antide que le
    diable, qui le portait a Rome sur son dos, adresse le distique latin
    dont il est question ci-dessus."

It should seem that this trick of _carrying people to Rome_ was attributed
to the devil, by those conversant with his habits, in other centuries
besides the nineteenth.

I have not here the means of looking at the work to which Pluquet refers;
but if any of your correspondents, who live in more bookish lands than
this, will do so, they may perchance obtain some clue to the original
authorship of the lines; for in Sidonius Apollinaris I cannot find them.
The only edition of his works to which I have the means of referring is the
quarto of Adrien Perrier, Paris, 1609. Among the verses contained in that
volume, I think I can assert that the lines in question are not. We all
know that the worthy author of the _Curiosities of Literature_ cannot be
much depended upon for accuracy.

Once again, then, Who was the author of this specimen, perhaps the most
perfect extant, of palindromic absurdity?

    "When I was born, I drew in the common air, and fell upon the earth,
    which is of like nature, _and the first voice which I uttered was
    crying, as all others do_."--_Wisd._ vii. 3.

 "Tum porro Puer, ut saevis projectus ab undis
  Navita, _nudus, humi jacet_, Infans, indigus omni
  Vitali auxilio; cum primum in luminis oras
  Nixibus ex alvo matris natura profudit:
  _Vagituque locum lugubri complet_, ut aequum est,
  Cui tantum in vita restet transire malorum."
                  _Lucret. De Rer. Nat._, v. 223.

For the benefit of the lady-readers of "N. & Q." I subjoin a translation of
these beautiful lines of Lucretius:

    "The infant, as soon as Nature with great pangs of travail hath sent it
    forth from the womb of its mother into the regions of light, lies, like
    a sailor cast out from the waves, _naked upon the earth_ in utter want
    and helplessness; _and fills every place around with mournful wailings_
    and piteous lamentation, as is natural for one who has so many ills of
    life in store for him, so many evils which he must pass through and
    suffer."

 "Thou must be patient: we came crying hither;
  Thou know'st, the first time that we smell the air,
  We wawle and cry--
  When we are born, we cry that we are come
  To this great stage of fools."--Shakspeare's _Lear_.

    "Who remindeth me of the sins of my infancy? 'For in Thy sight none is
    pure from sin, not even the infant whose life is but a day upon the
    earth.' (Job xxv. 4.) Who remindeth me? Doth not each little infant, in
    whom I see what of myself I remember not? What then was my sin? Was it
    that I _hung upon the breast and cried_?"--St. Austin, _Confess._, lib.
    i. 7.

    "For man's sake it should seeme that Nature made and produced all other
    creatures besides; though this great favour of hers, so bountifull and
    beneficiall in that respect, hath cost them full deere. Insomuch as it
    is hard to judge, whether in so doing she hath done the part of a kind
    mother, or a hard and cruell stepdame. For first and foremost, of all
    other living creatures, man she hath brought forth all naked, and
    cloathed him with the good and riches of others. To all the rest she
    hath given sufficient to clad them everie {344} one according to their
    kind; as namely shells, cods, hard hides, prickes, shagge, bristles,
    haire, downe, feathers, quils, skailes, and fleeces of wool. The verie
    trunkes and stemmes of trees and plants, shee hath defended with bark
    and rind, yea, and the same sometime double against the injuries both
    of heat and cold: man alone, poore wretch, she hath laid _all naked
    upon the bare earth, even on his birth-day, to cry and wraule presently
    from the very first houre that he is borne into this world_: in suche
    sort as, _among so many living creatures, there is none subject to shed
    teares and weepe like him. And verily to no babe or infant is it given
    once to laugh before he be fortie daies old_, and that is counted verie
    early and with the soonest.... The child of man thus untowardly borne,
    and who another day is to rule and command all other, loe how he lyeth
    bound hand and foot, weeping and crying, and beginning his life with
    miserie, as if he were to make amends and satisfaction by his
    punishment unto Nature, for this onely fault and trespass, that he is
    borne alive."--Plinie's _Naturall Historie_, by Phil. Holland, Lond.
    1601, fol., intr. to b. vii.

The following queries are extracted from Sir Thomas Browne's "Common-place
Books," _Aristotle, Lib. Animal._:

    "Whether till after forty days children, though they cry, weep not; or,
    as Scaliger expresseth it, 'Vagiunt sed oculis siccis.'

    "Whether they laugh not upon tickling?

    "Why, though some children have been heard to cry in the womb, _yet so
    few cry at their birth_, though their heads be out of the
    womb?"--Bohn's ed. iii. 358.

Thompson follows Pliny, and says that man is "taught _alone_ to weep"
("Spring," 350.); but--not to speak of the

                 "Cruel crafty crocodile,
  Which, in false grief hiding his harmful guile,
  Doth weep full sore and sheddeth tender tears,"

as Spenser sings--the camel weeps when over-loaded, and the deer when
chased sobs piteously. Thompson himself in a passage he has stolen from
Shakspeare, makes the stag weep:

                  ----"he stands at bay;
  _The big round tears_ run down his dappled face;
  He groans in anguish."--Autumn, 452.

    "Steller relates this of the _Phoca Ursina_, Pallas of the camel, and
    Humboldt of a small American monkey."--Laurence _On Man_, Lond. 1844,
    p. 161.

Risibility, and a sense of the ridiculous, is generally considered to be
the property of man, though _Le Cat_ states that he has seen a chimpanzee
laugh.

The notion with regard to a child crying at baptism has been already
touched on in these pages, Vol. vi., p. 601.; Vol. vii., p. 96.

Grose (quoted in Brand) tells us there is a superstition that a child who
does not cry when sprinkled in baptism will not live; and the same is
recorded in Hone's _Year-Book_.

UNPUBLISHED LETTER OF LORD NELSON.

The following letter of Lord Nelson may, especially at the present moment,
interest and amuse some of the readers of "N. & Q." The original is in my
possession, and was given me by the late Miss Churchey of Brecon, daughter
of the gentleman to whom it was addressed. Can any of your readers inform
me where the "old lines" quoted by the great hero are to be found?

Merton, Oct. 20, 1802.

Sir,

Your idea is most just and proper, that a provision should be made for
midshipmen who have served a certain time with good characters, and
certainly twenty pounds is a very small allowance; but how will your
surprise be increased, when I tell you that their _full_ pay, when
watching, fighting and bleeding for their country at sea, is not equal to
that sum. An admiral's half-pay is scarcely equal, including the run of a
kitchen, to that of a French cook; a captain's but little better than a
valet's; and a lieutenant's certainly not equal to a London footman's; a
midshipman's nothing. But as I am a seaman, and faring with them, I can say
nothing. I will only apply some very old lines wrote at the end of some
former war:

   "Our God and sailor we adore,
    In time of danger, not before;
  The danger past, both are alike requited,
  God is forgotten, and the sailor slighted."

Your feelings do you great honour, and I only wish all others in the
kingdom were the same. However, if ever I should be placed in a situation
to be useful to such a deserving set of young men as our mids, nothing
shall be left undone which may be in the power of,

          Dear Sir,
              Your most obedient servant,
                      NELSON AND BRONTE.

FOLK LORE.

_Devonshire Superstitions._--Seeing that you sometimes insert extracts from
newspapers, I forward you a copy of a paragraph which appeared in _The
Times_ of March 7, 1854, and which is worth a corner in your folk-lore
columns:

    "The following gross case of superstition, which occurred as late as
    Sunday se'nnight, in one of the largest {345} market towns in the north
    of Devon, is related by an eye-witness:--A young woman, living in the
    neighbourhood of Holsworthy, having for some time past been subject to
    periodical fits of illness, endeavoured to effect a cure by attendance
    at the afternoon service at the parish church, accompanied by thirty
    young men, her near neighbours. Service over, she sat in the porch of
    the church, and each of the young men, as they passed out in
    succession, dropped a penny into her lap; but the last, instead of a
    penny, gave her half-a-crown, taking from her the twenty-nine pennies
    which she had already received. With this half-crown in her hand, she
    walked three times round the communion-table, and afterwards had it
    made into a ring, by the wearing of which she believes she will recover
    her health."

HAUGHMOND ST. CLAIR.

_Quacks._--In the neighbourhood of Sevenoaks, Kent, a little girl was
bitten by a mad dog lately. Instead of sending for the doctor, her father
posted off to an old woman famous for her treatment of hydrophobia. The old
woman sent a quart bottle of some dark liquid, which the patient is to take
twice or thrice daily: and for this the father, though but a poor labourer,
had to pay one pound. The liquid is said by the "country sort" to be
infallible. It is made of herbs plucked by the old woman, and mixed with
milk. Its preparation is of course a grand secret. As yet, the child keeps
well.

Near Whitechapel, London, is another old woman, equally famous; but her
peculiar talent is not for hydrophobia, but for scalds. Whenever any of the
Germans employed in the numerous sugar-refineries in that neighbourhood
scald themselves, they beg, instead of being sent to the hospital, to be
taken to the old woman. For a few sovereigns, she will take them in, nurse,
and cure them; and I was informed by a proprietor of a large sugar-house
there, that often in a week she will heal a scald as thoroughly as the
hospital will in a month, and send the men back hearty and fit for work to
boot. She uses a good deal of linseed-oil, I am told; but her great secret,
they say, is, that she gives the whole of her time and attention to the
patient.

Minor Notes.

_Vallancey's Green Book._--Perhaps your readers are not aware of the
existence of the curious and interesting volume mentioned in the following
cutting from Jones's last _Catalogue_ (D'Olier St. Dublin). It may
therefore be worth making a note of in your columns:

    "1008. Vallancey's Green Book, _manuscript, folio_.

    *** Vallancey's Green Book, so named from being bound in green vellum,
    was the volume in which the celebrated Irish antiquary, General Charles
    Vallancey, entered the titles of all the manuscripts and printed works
    relative to Ireland which he had occasion to consult in his antiquarian
    researches. The copy now offered for sale is believed to be the only
    one extant. Bound in the same volume is a collection of the titles of
    all the manuscripts relating to Ireland, which are preserved in the
    Archbishop of Canterbury's library, at Lambeth, London."

_Herrings._--"The lovers of fish" may be glad to learn what a bloater is, a
mystery which I endeavoured to unravel when lately on the Norfolk coast. A
bloater, I was informed, is a large, plump herring (as we say a _bloated_
toad); and the genuine claimants of the title fall by their own weight from
the meshes of the net.

The origin of the simile--"As dead as a herring"--may not be generally
known. This fish dies immediately upon its removal from the native element
(strange to say) from want of air; for swimming near the surface it
requires much, and the gills, when dry, cannot perform their function.

_Byron and Rochefoucauld._--The following almost word-for-word renderings
of two of Rochefoucauld's _Reflexions_ occur in the third and fourth
stanzas of the third canto of Byron's _Don Juan_. I am not aware that any
notice has been taken of them beyond a note appended to the first passage,
in Moore's edition of Byron's _Works_, attributing the _mot_ to Montaigne:

 "Yet there are some, they say, who have had _none_,
  But those who have ne'er end with only _one_."--_Byron._

    "On peut trouver des femmes qui n'ont jamais eu de galanterie; mais il
    est rare d'en trouver qui n'en aient jamais eu
    qu'une."--Rochefoucauld's _Maximes et Reflexions Morales_.

 "In her first passion, woman loves her lover,
  In all the others all she loves is love."--_Byron_

    "Dans les premieres passions les femmes aiment l'amant; dans les autres
    elles aiment l'amour."--Rochefoucauld's _Maximes et Reflexions
    Morales_.

"_Abscond._"--This is a word which appears to have lost its primary meaning
of concealment, apart from that of escape. Horace Walpole, however, uses it
in the former sense:

    "Virette _absconds_, and has sent M. de Pecquigny word that _he shall
    abscond_ till he can find a proper opportunity of fighting him."

CHEVERELLS.

_Garlands, Broadsheets, &c._--Will you allow me to suggest to your
correspondents, that it would be very desirable, for literary and
antiquarian purposes, to form as complete a list as possible of public and
private collections of garlands, broadsheets, chap-books, ballads, tracts,
&c.; and to ask them to forward to "N. & Q." the names of any such public
or private collections as they may be acquainted with. I need not say
anything of the importance and value of the ballads, &c., contained in such
collections, to the historical student and the archaeologist, for their
value is too well known to require it; but I would earnestly urge the
formation of such a list as the one I now {348} suggest, which will greatly
facilitate literary researches.

_Life-belts._--Suppose that each person on board the Tayleur had been
supplied with a life-belt, how many hundreds of lives would have been
saved? And when it is considered that such belts can be made for less than
half-a-crown each, what reason can there be that government should not
require them to be carried, at least in emigrant vessels, if passengers are
so ignorant and stupid as not voluntarily to provide them for themselves?

Italy, the Greek Islands, to Constantinople, &c._ (2nd edit., two vols.
8vo. 1794):

    "The Turks have been, and indeed deserve to be, praised for the manner
    in which they declared war against the Russians. They sent by Mr.
    Bulgakoff, her Imperial Majesty's minister at the Porte, to demand the
    restitution of the Crimea, which had been extorted from them by the
    merciless despot of R----a, (_sic_) when too much distressed by a
    rebellion in Egypt to protect it. On his return without an answer they
    put him in the Seven Towers, and commenced hostilities. They hate the
    Russians; and to show it the more, frequently call a Frank _Moscoff_.
    To the English they are more partial than to any other Christian
    nation, from a tradition that Mahomet was prevented by death from
    converting our ancestors to his faith."--Vol. ii. pp. 276-7.

"_Verbatim et literatim._"--As this phrase often finds insertion, even in
the pages of "N. & Q.," it may be well to call attention to the fact that
there is no such adverb as _literatim_ in the Latin language. There is the
adverb _literate_, which means after the manner of a literate man,
learnedly; but to express the idea intended by the coined word _literatim_,
I think we must use the form _ad literam_--"_Verbatim et ad literam._"

PRINTS OF LONDON BEFORE THE GREAT FIRE.

In addition to the Tower, there was in Cromwell's time the fortification of
Baynard's Castle, near Blackfriars, and the city gates were also
fortifications on a small scale; they were rebuilt (St. John's,
Clerkenwell, excepted, which was spared) after the Great Fire, and were
taken down somewhere about 1760. Can any of your readers tell me whether
there is any series of prints extant of the most remarkable buildings which
were destroyed by the fire? There are some few maps, and a print or two
interspersed here and there, in the British Museum; but is there any
regular series of plates? We know that Inigo Jones built a Grecian portico
on to the east end of the Gothic cathedral of old St. Paul's, surmounted
with statues of Charles I., &c.; that the Puritans destroyed a beautiful
conduit at the top of Cheapside; that Sir Thomas Gresham's Exchange was
standing. But among the many city halls burnt down, were there any fine
specimens of architecture, any churches worthy of note? And as Guildhall
was not entirely consumed, what parts of the present edifice belong to the
olden time?

You are doubtless aware that the fire did not extend to St. Giles's
Cripplegate, and that at the back of the church are remains of the old city
walls.

BATTLE OF OTTERBURN.

On what authority does Mr. Tytler (_History of Scotland_, vol. iii. pp.
45--53.), in his otherwise very fair account of this celebrated battle,
assert that the Earl of Douglas was a younger man than Hotspur? I have no
doubt that he found it so recorded somewhere, and willingly believed that
his countrymen had prevailed, not only over superior numbers of the enemy,
but also over greater experience on the part of the hostile general; but a
little more investigation would have shown him that the difference of age
lay the other way. Henry Percy, by his own account (in the Scrope and
Grosvenor Controversy), was born in 1366, and was therefore twenty-two when
the battle was fought. I do not know that there is any direct evidence to
Douglas's age, but the following considerations appear to me decisive as to
his being much older than his rival.

1. Froissart's visit to Scotland was undoubtedly prior to 1366 (although
the exact date is not given), and during his stay of fifteen days at
Dalkeith, he saw much of the youthful heir of that castle, the future hero
of Otterburn, and describes him as a "promising youth."

2. Hotspur, in his deposition above mentioned, says that he first bore arms
at the siege of Berwick in 1378; but his antagonist must have commenced his
military career long before, as Froissart mentions him as knighted on the
occasion of the battle fought a few days after the surrender of that place,
between Sir Archibald Douglas and Sir Thomas Musgrave; none but kings' sons
were knighted in childhood in those days, or without undergoing a long
previous probation in the inferior grades of chivalry.

3. An early and constant family (if not general) tradition asserts that
Douglas had a natural son {349} (ancestor of the Cavers family), old enough
to bear his father's banner in the battle; on this, however, I lay little
stress, as Froissart distinctly assigns that honourable post to another
person, David Campbell, who was slain by the side of his lord.

Mr. Tytler is also evidently wrong in placing, on the authority of
Macpherson's _Notes on Winton_, this battle on the 5th of August, 1388.
Froissart gives the date as the 19th of August, and as the moon was full on
the 18th, the combatants would have bright moonlight all night, which
agrees with all the narratives; on the 5th they would have little
moonlight, and would have lost it soon.

Though not very germane to the matter, except as being a point of
chronology, I may add here that the remarkable solar eclipse, long
remembered in Scotland by the name of the "Dark Hour," did not occur, as
stated by Mr. Tytler, on 17th June, 1432, but on the same month and day of
the following year.

DE BEAUVOIR PEDIGREE.

I have in my possession a curious ancient pedigree of De Beauvoir and
Harryes, headed thus:

    "The name De Beauvoir is from ---- in the kingdom of England; came into
    England with y^e Conquest of the Norman Duke, from whom is descended
    all that are now in England, they bearing for their coate armour the
    _first_, Azure, a chevron or, between three cinquefeuilles argent, by
    the name of De Beauvoir. The _second_ he beareth the guelles a chevron
    between three hayeres heads erased, by the name of Harreys. The _third_
    (or) a lyon rampant azure, by the name of Throlpe. The _fourth_,
    Argent, a fess between three cressentes azure, by the name of ...
    within a mantle doubled guelles on two helmetes and torseyes proper and
    the first a demy-dragon, adorned properly guelles and argent, vert, by
    the foresaid name De Beauvoir; on the second a harye sitting argent
    between two bushes vert."

The pedigree begins with "Sir Robert Beauvoir, Lord Beauvoir, Lord Baron of
Beaver Castle, Knt.;" and the maternal line with "Sir Robert Harryes of
Malden in Essex, Knt., came into England with the Saxons."

In the tenth descent the sole heiress is represented as marrying "Robert,
Lord Bellmoint," whose sole daughter married "John, Lord Manners, father of
Edmund Manners, first Earl of Rutland, from whom is descended Roger, Earl
of Rutland, now living."

The pedigree ends with the nineteenth descendant, Henry de Beauvoir, of the
Isle of Guernsey, who married the daughter of Peter Harreys of the Isle of
Guernsey.

Can any reader of "N. & Q." inform me whether descendants of that marriage
are still to be found, and where?

There are points in the pedigree, as genealogists will see, totally
discrepant from the Peerages.

_Dog-whippers: Frankincense._--Can any reader throw light upon the
following entries in the churchwardens' account-book for the parish of
Forest Hill, near Oxford?

    "1694. P^d to Tho. Mills for whipping dogs out of church, 1 shilling.

    "1702. P^d for frankincense for the church, 6 pence."

The only passage which occurs to me as at all bearing upon so late a use of
incense in parish churches in this country, is the following extract from
Herbert:

    "The country parson hath a care that his church be swept and kept
    clean; and at great festivals, strewed and stuck with boughs, and
    perfumed with incense."

This hardly brings the custom later than 1630.

As regards the former entry, I am told by a friend that the office of
dog-whipper existed about fifty years ago for the church of Heversham in
Westmoreland.

_Atchievement in Yorkshire--Lipyeatt Family._--Found and noted in a
Yorkshire church tower, an atchievement painted apparently about forty or
fifty years ago, of which no account can be given by the sexton or parish
clerk. Query, to what names do the bearings belong? viz. Vert, on a fess
or, between three bezants, three lions passant azure. Impaling: Vert, three
swans in tri, statant, wings erect, argent. Crest, a lion passant azure,
langued gules. The swans have head, neck, and body like swans, but their
legs appear to have been borrowed from the stork. It is suspected that the
dexter coat belongs to one of the Wiltshire Lipyeatts.

Is there any pedigree of the Lipyeatt family, who were burghers of wealth
and consideration in the town of Marlborough, from the middle of the
seventeenth century down to the latter part of the eighteenth?

_Helen MacGregor._--In Burke's _Landed Gentry_ (Supplement, art. "MacGregor

woman of _agreeable temper_ and domestic habits, active and careful in the
management of her family affairs." This is so directly opposed, not only to
Scott's description, but to the generality of traditions about her, that,
as Campbell says, "it makes the hair of one's literary faith stand on end."
Helen was, very likely, a different person from what she afterwards became,
ere the events happened that drove Rob Roy "to the hill-side to become a
broken man;" but one can hardly imagine her, in her most happy days, to
have been such a person as is above depicted--an amiable wife and clever
housekeeper. The pen of a descendant is evident, in the partial description
given of both husband and wife.

near Maidstone, in 1778. I think the trial took place then, or within a
year or two of that date; and should be thankful to any reader of "N. & Q."
who would supply me with the precise date when the court-martial assembled?

James: "I, King of Kings, come to James the First and Sixth, nothing
wavering."

    "These puns much applauded in those times, insomuch that the preacher

Upsal; but other accounts are to be met with. What however I particularly
refer to, is the question, who was the mother of his daughter Alice, who
married Sir Gilbert Talbot? Lady Talbot could not have been by the daughter
of Lord Scroope of Upsal; as, if so, she and her issue would have inherited
her grandfather's barony, which it is certain was enjoyed by his younger
brothers. Very likely Mr. Scroope's unpublished volume on the Lords Scroope
and their seat Coombe Castle explains this.

_"Chair" or "Char."_--I am desirous of ascertaining the meaning of this
term, as occurring frequently in the Cambridgeshire Fens. It is variously
spelt, _chair_, _chaire_, _chare_, or _char_. In the Cambridgeshire dialect
it may be remarked, _air_ or _are_ is pronounced as "ar." Thus, _upstairs_,
_bare_, are "upstars," "bar." There is a Char Fen at Stretham, laid down in
Sir Jonah Moore's Map (1663). There is also a Chare Fen at Cottenham; and
at Littleport is a place called Littleport Chair. This last had the name at
least as early as Edward II.'s reign; as in a description of a neighbouring
fen, not later than that date, one boundary is "A le _chaire_ per
Himmingslode usque Gualslode End." A friend who has searched the documents
in the Fen Office at Ely on this subject for me, has been unable to
discover the least clue to the meaning of the term.

At Newcastle-on-Tyne, a narrow street or passage between houses is called a
_chare_; but there is nothing narrow about Char Fen, which was part of an
open common. The course of the rivers at Littleport may be imagined to form
a rude outline of a chair or seat; but this does not apply to the other
instances in which the name occurs.

There are numerous local names in the fens, of which the history may be
traced for some centuries, deserving investigation.

_Aches._--I am aware that there is abundant proof of "aches" being a

    from that privilege of even perpetual curates."--Lecture xi., p. 133.

_Shelley's "Prometheus Unbound."_--Can any of your correspondents, by
conjecture or reference to the original MS., elucidate the meaning of the
following passage, which occurs in Act II. Sc. 4. of this extraordinary

understand it.

 "_Asia._ Who made that sense which, when the winds of spring
  In rarest visitation, or the voice
  Of one beloved heard in youth alone,
  Fills the faint eyes with falling tears which dim
  The radiant looks of unbewailing flowers,
  And leaves this peopled world a solitude
  When it returns no more?"

Shelley's mysticism is very often such as to render him unintelligible to
ordinary readers, but it is combined here with a want of grammatical {352}
connexion that makes obscurity ten times more obscure. I have not the least
idea whether "fills" refers to "sense which," or to "voice;" but
whichsoever it may belong to, it is evident that the other nominative
singular, as also the plural "winds of spring," have no verbs, either
expressed or understood, to govern. A line or two may have dropped out; but
all editions as far as I am aware, give the passage as above. In Act I., at
p. 195. line 7 of the edition of 1853, occurs a curious error (I presume of
the press); Mercury, addressing the Furies, says:

       "Back to your towers of iron,
  And gnash beside the streams of fire, and wail
  Your foodless teeth."

The having no food to put between one's teeth is no doubt a very sufficient
cause for wailing, but still I think the passage would run better if
"gnash" and "wail" exchanged places. How do other editions give it?

On a disk, of about six inches in diameter, are engraved the royal arms of
Great Britain, without the harp, but with the Scots lion. You will at once
perceive the peculiarity of this bearing, the harp and the lion having been
added at the same time by James I. The leopards occupy the first quarter,
the ground of which is semeed with _hearts_; the Scots lion the second, his
feet resting upon a quaint band, which seems to occupy the place of the
usual bordure. The three fleurs-de-lis, very much broadened, and taking
almost the shape of crowns, occupy the places of the third and fourth
quarters.

The only instance I can find of a single lion or leopard appearing upon a
coin without the harp, is a coin (a half-florin) of Edward III., on the
obverse of which appears a leopard crowned, with a banner of the arms of
England fastened to his neck, and flowing back upon his shoulder.

GWYDDNO'S Query regarding Leicester's Rangership of Snowdon, and the
patriotic opposition offered to his oppressions. I regret I am unable to
afford the desired information respecting the imprisonment of the Welsh
gentleman in the Tower. Could not this be furnished by some of your readers
who have access to public documents and records of the period? This
imprisonment is not mentioned either in the account I append, or in a
longer one to be found in Appendix XVI. vol. iii. of Pennant's _Tour in
Wales_:

    "Among the Welsh nobility who formed a part of her Majesty's household,
    were Sir Richard Bulkeley, Bart., and Mrs. Blanche Parry, both of whom
    seem to have been brought up in the court from their infancy, and,
    consequently, in great esteem with her Majesty; so much so, that the
    Earl of Leicester, the Queen's favourite, began to be jealous of Sir
    Richard: and with a view of having him removed from court, he made an
    attempt to have him accused, upon false evidence, of treason. With this
    wicked design, the Earl of Leicester informed her Majesty that the
    council had been examining Sir Richard Bulkeley, and that they found
    him a dangerous person; that he dwelt in a suspicious corner of the
    world, and should be committed to the Tower. 'What! Sir Richard
    Bulkeley!' said the Queen; 'he never intended us any harm. We have
    brought him up from a boy, and have had special trial of his fidelity;
    ye shall not commit him.' 'We have the care of your Majesty's person,'
    said the Earl, 'and see more and hear more of the man than you do: he
    is of an aspiring mind, and lives in a remote place.' 'Before God!'
    replied the Queen; 'we will be sworn upon the Holy Evangelists, he
    never intended any harm.' And then her Majesty ran to the Bible, and
    kissing it, said: 'You shall not commit him; we have brought him up
    from a boy.' Sir Richard, however, was too high-minded to suffer such
    an imputation to be laid to his character. He insisted on an inquiry;
    during which it appeared, that Lord Dudley, Earl of Leicester, had been
    appointed a ranger of the Royal Forest of Snowdon, which, in the
    Queen's time, included some portion of Merioneth and Anglesey. This
    nobleman's insolence to the inhabitants of the forest was more than
    could be brooked. He tried to bring many freeholders' estates within
    the boundary; juries were empannelled, but the commissioners rejected
    their returns as unfavourable to the Earl. Those honest jurors,
    however, persisted, and found a verdict for the country. But in the
    year 1538, he succeeded by a packed jury, who appeared in his livery,
    blue, with ragged staves on the sleeves; men who, after this nefarious
    act, were stigmatised with the title of 'The Black Jury who sold their
    country.' Sir Richard Bulkeley, who, with Sir William Herbert and
    others, superseded a prior commission, resisted this oppression with
    great firmness, and laid those odious grievances before the Queen,
    whose regard for her loyal subjects in Wales was evinced by the
    recalling of the first commission, by proclamation at Westminster, in
    1579. The Earl being worsted, sought the life of Sir Richard by having
    him charged as above. But this generous and patriotic nobleman, by his
    excellent and manly conduct, overthrew every malevolent design of his
    enemy; and came out of this fiery trial as clear as the pellucid
    crystal of Snowdon."

INMAN FAMILY.

(Vol. ix., p. 198.)

A SUBSCRIBER having challenged me by name to assist him in resolving his
"historic doubts," I hasten to afford him what information I possess,
conscious at the same time that I can add little or nothing that will
materially aid him in his investigation.

First, then, as to Owen Gam. This name savours strongly of the leek, both
Christian and surname being unequivocally British. _Gam_, in Welsh,
signifies the "one-eyed;" we may conclude, therefore, that this gentleman,
or one of his progenitors, had lost an eye in one of the frays common in
bygone days, and so acquired the appellation of _Gam_. A SUBSCRIBER has
omitted to give dates with his Queries, and thus leaves us in the dark as
to the precise period he refers to; still, it may interest him to know that
David Gam, a landed proprietor of some importance in Herefordshire, temp.
Henry IV. and V., who had married the sister of Owen Glyndwr, was
discovered in an attempt to assassinate his brother-in-law, the royal
chieftain; and was, in consequence, arrested {354} and confined ten years
in Owen's prison at Llansaintffraid. He was afterwards released; and
distinguished himself, together with some near relatives, as Pennant
relates, at the battle of Agincourt, where he fell, pierced with wounds,
while assisting in the rescue of his royal master King Henry. Possibly,
Owen Gam may have been a descendant of this half-hero, half-assassin.

Llewellyn Clifford, again, is a name strongly suggestive of its owner's
connexion with Cambria. If A SUBSCRIBER has exhausted the resources of the
Clifford pedigrees, it were, I suppose, useless to refer him to the
ancestry of the defunct Earls of Cumberland; and especially to that part of
it represented by Sir Roger de Clifford, of Clifford, co. Hereford, a
famous soldier in the days of Henry III. and Edward I. He accompanied the
latter monarch in his inroads into Wales, and fell in battle there, not far
from Bangor, circa 1282-3, leaving several children; one of the younger of
whom I conjecture to have been the father of the before-named Llewellyn
Clifford. After having subjugated the country, we can easily fancy the
conquerors perpetuating the event by naming certain of their posterity
after the fallen prince Llewellyn.

As for Sir William de Roas (or Ros), A SUBSCRIBER is wrong in supposing his
name to have been Ingman; for although he resided at Ingmanthorpe, co.
York, his surname, in common with that of a long line of ancestry and
descendants, was De Ros only. He was the grandson of Robert de Ros, the
founder of the two castles, Werke and Hamlake, and one of the leaders of
the baronial forces in their armed opposition to the tyrant King John.

Before closing this communication, I would suggest to A SUBSCRIBER, and to
all others propounding genealogical Queries, the absolute necessity of
affixing _dates_ to their inquiries in every possible instance; as nothing
is easier than to go astray, sometimes for half-a-dozen generations, in
fixing the identity of a solitary individual.

ROBERT DUDLEY, EARL OF LEICESTER.

(Vol. ix., pp. 105. 160.)

That this infamous man _did_ die of poison, is, I believe, the general
opinion. The late Dr. Cooke Taylor has the following passage upon the
subject, in his _Romantic Biography of the Age of Elizabeth_, vol. i.
p. 115.:

    "Nearly all the cotemporary writers assert that Leicester fell a victim
    to poison; Naunton declares that he, by mistake, swallowed the potion
    he had prepared for another person; and, as there can be no doubt that
    the Earl was a poisoner of great eminence and success, the story is far
    from being improbable. The Privy Council must have believed that his
    death was not natural, for they minutely investigated a report that he
    had been poisoned by the son of Sir James Crofts, in revenge for the
    imprisonment of his father. Some suspicious circumstances were elicited
    during the examination; but the matter was suddenly dropped, probably
    because an inquiry into any one of the complicated intrigues of
    Elizabeth's court would have involved too many persons of honour and
    consequence."

Drummond of Hawthornden, in his _Notes of Conversations with Ben Jonson_,
has the following curious note:

    "The Earl of Leicester gave a bottle of liquor to his lady, which he
    willed her to use in any faintness; which she, after his returne from
    Court, not knowing it was poison, gave him, and so he died."

This is a strong confirmation of the statement given by Sir Robert Naunton.

In one of the many valuable notes appended by Dr. Bliss to the _Athenae
Oxonienses_, is the following cotemporary narrative, copied from a MS.
memoranda on a copy of _Leicester's Ghost_:

    "The author (of the poem) hath omitted the end of the Earle, the which
    may thus and truely be supplied. The Countesse Lettice fell in love
    with Christopher Blunt, gent., of the Earle's horse; and they had many
    secret meetings, and much wanton familiarity; the which being
    discovered by the Earle, to prevent the pursuit thereof, when Generall
    of the Low Countreys, hee tooke Blunt with him, and theire purposed to
    have him made away: and for this plot there was a ruffian of Burgundy
    suborned, who, watching him in one night going to his lodging at the
    Hage, followed him and struck at his head with a halbert or battle-axe,
    intending to cleave his head. But the axe glaunced, and withall pared
    off a great piece of Blunt's skull, which was very dangerous and longe
    in healinge: but he recovered, and after married the Countesse; who
    took this soe ill, as that she, with Blunt, deliberated and resolved to
    dispatch the Earle. The Earle, not patient of this soe greate wrong of
    his wife, purposed to carry her to Kenilworth; and to leave here there
    untill her death by naturall or by violent means, but rather by the
    last. The Countesse also having a suspicion, or some secret
    intelligence of this treachery against her, provided artificial meanes
    to prevent the Earle; which was by a cordiall, the which she had no fit
    opportunity to offer him till he came to Cornebury Hall, in
    Oxfordshire; where the Earle, after his gluttonous manner, surfeiting
    with excessive eating and drinking, fell soe ill that he was forced to
    stay there. Then the deadly cordiall was propounded unto him by the
    Countesse; as Mr. William Haynes, sometimes the Earle's page, and then
    gentleman of his bed-chamber, told me, who protested hee saw her give
    that fatall cup to the Earle, which was his last draught, and an end of
    his plott against the Countesse, and of his journey, and of himselfe;

HARDMAN'S ACCOUNT OF WATERLOO.

(Vol. viii., p. 199.; Vol. ix., p. 176.)

I perfectly recollect reading, when a boy, a critique on this poem, and
being much amused thereby. The critique appeared in the _Literary Gazette_
or _Athenaeum_, as well as I remember. I never saw the poem, but I recollect
some of the lines quoted, which went nearly as follows:--

 "The following morning, at break of day,
  An orderly dragoon did come this way:
  'Holloa! holloa! I say, give ear,
  Is Adjutant Hardman quartered here?
  Holloa! halloa! I am not wrong,
  Is Adjutant Hardman here at home?'"

I merely quote from memory and hope, therefore, that any deviations from
the original may be pardoned.

Lieutenant (Brevet Captain) Hardman, if not a first-rate poet, is a gallant
soldier, and I rejoice to see his name in the _Army List_ for March, 1854.
I cannot ascertain at what period he joined the army, but he was present at
the cavalry engagements of Sahagun and Benevente, on December 20th and
27th, 1808, on the retreat of Sir John Moore's army to Coruna, for which he
is decorated with a Peninsula medal. For his bravery as a non-commissioned
officer he was promoted, May 19, 1813, to a cornetcy in the royal wagon
train; and was transferred, August 12 following, to the 23rd Light
Dragoons, and was same day appointed Regimental Adjutant of that corps. On
the almost total change of officers that took place in the 10th Hussars,
owing to the quarrels of Colonels Quentin and Palmer, Lieutenant Hardman
succeeded Captain Bromley, on December 15, 1814, as Lieutenant and Adjutant
in the corps in which he had commenced his military career; a sufficient
proof of his having been a zealous, active, and efficient non-commissioned
officer, when serving as such in the regiment. He embarked at Ramsgate with
the service squadrons of his regiment in April, 1815, and landed at Ostend,
whence the 10th regiment proceeded to Brussels: it was present at Quatre
Bras, although not engaged with the enemy: and at Waterloo it behaved with
the greatest gallantry, and lost two officers, nineteen soldiers, and
fifty-one horses killed, in addition to six officers and twenty-six men
wounded. Lieutenant Hardman's position as adjutant necessarily kept him in
the vicinity of his commanding officers, Col. Quentin and Major Howard;
therefore he was an eye-witness of poor Howard's death. Lieutenant Hardman
received the Waterloo medal. The 10th Hussars landed at Ramsgate, from
Boulogne, in January, 1816, and marched to Brighton, where Lieutenant
Hardman resigned the adjutantcy, February 8, 1816, and exchanged to
half-pay of the regiment, June 6, same year, since which period he has not
served upon full pay.

CHURCHES IN "DOMESDAY BOOK."

(Vol. viii., p. 151.)

A. W. H. says, "In the case of many parishes it is stated [in _Domesday
Book_], that there was a church there: is it considered _conclusive_
authority that there was not one, if it is not mentioned in _Domesday
Book_?" This question has, I doubt not, often engaged the attention of
antiquaries; and I am somewhat surprised that the Query has elicited no
reply. The conclusion has often been drawn that, no church being mentioned,
none existed before the survey. It would appear this conclusion has been an
erroneous one. In the last volume issued by the Chetham Society (_Documents
relating to the Priory of Penwortham, and other Possessions in Lancashire
of the Abbey of Evesham_, edited by W. A. Hulton, Esq.) that point is ably
discussed; and as Mr. Hulton's views on a subject of so much interest
cannot but be valuable, I venture to extract them, as worthy of a place in
"N. & Q." He says:

    "Donations of churches with tithes are made directly after the survey
    of _Domesday_ was taken. And yet that survey is entirely silent as to
    their existence. Similar omissions have given rise to doubts, whether
    the institution of our parochial economy had been carried out to its
    full extent previous to the Conquest, and whether we are not indebted
    to the Normans for its full perfection. Such doubts are unfounded....
    There is nothing in _Domesday_ to justify the doubts alluded to. A
    consideration of the objects of that survey will dissipate them: the
    purpose was principally financial. It was directed so as to obtain a
    correct account of the taxable property within the kingdom. And it was
    immaterial whether the proceeds were paid altogether to the owner, or a
    definite portion was diverted into other channels. Therefore those
    churches which were endowed only with tithes of the surrounding
    districts, as Eccleston and Croston, Penwortham and Leyland, in Leyland
    Hundred, and Rochdale and Eccles, in Salford Hundred, were unnoticed,
    although the two first-named churches were granted by Roger de Poictou,
    with their tithes and other appurtenances, to the Priory of Lancaster;
    and the pages of the _Coucher Book of Whalley_ prove the two latter
    churches to have existed at a date perhaps anterior to the Conquest.
    But the case was different when a church was endowed with glebe-land.
    Such a church appeared in the light of a landowner, and in that
    character is its existence notified. Thus, in modern Lancashire, south
    of the Ribble, the churches of Wigan and Winwick, Childwall, Walton,
    Warrington, Manchester, Blackburn, and Whalley are expressly named in
    _Domesday_, but invariably in connexion with the ownership of land. It
    seems clear, therefore, that the silence of _Domesday_ cannot be urged
    as a proof of the {356} non-existence of a church, or of the subsequent
    grant of those rights and privileges by which its due efficiency is
    maintained."--_Introd._, p. xxiii.

MEMOIRS OF GRAMMONT.

(Vol. viii., pp. 461. 549.; Vol. ix., pp. 3. 204.)

    "Ceste noble race de Grantmont."--_Brantome._

The following are some of the principal events in the life of the Chevalier
de Grammont.

He was born in the year 1621, probably at the family seat of Bidache, in
Gascony.

He was sent to the college at Pau in Bearn, the nearest university to the
family residence. His studies here did not much benefit him; and although
intended for the church, we find him at a later period actually highly
commending the Lord's Prayer, and seriously inquiring by whom it was
written. On his declining a clerical life, he was sent to the French army
in Piedmont in 1643. He served under his brother, the Marshal, and the
Prince de Conde; and was present at the three battles of Fribourg on the
3rd, 5th, and 9th Aug. 1644; and at that of Nordlinguen on the 3rd Aug.
1645. It was at the battle of Fribourg that the Prince de Conde, having
failed in his first attack on the enemy, got off horseback, and placed
himself at the head of the regiment of Conti, whilst all the officers and
volunteers alighted also, amongst whom is mentioned the Chevalier de
Grammont; and this reassuring the soldiers, they charged the enemy, who
fled into a wood under favour of the approaching night. At Nordlinguen, the
Marshal de Grammont was taken prisoner, and nearly murdered by the Germans,
to revenge the death of their General, the great Mercy, who was slain in
the battle. The Marshal was subsequently exchanged against Gen. Gleen.

In 1647 Grammont served again under his brother and the Prince de Conde in
Spain: and in 1648 he was present with them at the battle of Lens on the
20th Aug., where the Archduke Leopold and General Beck were totally
defeated in Flanders.

The troubles of the Fronde now commenced; and in the first instance
Grammont zealously attached himself to the prince. In Dec. 1649, he tested
the accuracy of the report that it was intended to assassinate the prince
by sending his own coach with the prince's liveries over the Pont Neuf, to
see what would occur. The result was, the coach was fired at; but, as no
one was in it, the would-be assassins did no harm. During the imprisonment
of the princes, Grammont, with others, joined the Spanish army which had
advanced into Picardy, in consequence of the treaty the Duchesse de
Longueville and Turenne had made with the King of Spain.

We do not find when Grammont left the prince's party; the prince himself
admitted it was with honour. He seems to have connected himself with
Gaston, Duke of Orleans; and is styled about this time by "la Grande
Mademoiselle" as one of her father's gentlemen. She also relates that when
the royal forces threatened Orleans, the inhabitants sent to the duke for
succour, and he sent the Count de Fiesque and Mons. de Grammont, who
appeased their fears. The duke also advised his daughter to take the
opinion of Fiesque and Grammont in all matters, as they had been in Orleans
long enough to know what ought to be done. When Mademoiselle was trying to
effect an entrance into the city, Grammont incited the inhabitants to
assist in breaking open a gate, which the authorities, under fear of the
royal displeasure, were afraid to direct. The gate was broken open, and she
was borne in triumph along the streets.

It was probably at this period that Grammont sighed for the Countess de
Fiesque (about whom he, and his nephew the Count de Guiche, quarrelled); as
Mademoiselle, in her _Memoirs_, relates that, in the year 1656, on her
interview with Christina, Queen of Sweden, she presented to her, amongst
others, the Countess de Fiesque, one of her ladies of honour. The Queen
observed: "The Countess de Fiesque is not so beautiful as to have made so
much noise; is the Chevalier de Grammont still in love with her?"

In 1654 Grammont accompanied the Court to Peronne; where they anxiously
awaited Turenne's attempt to force the Prince de Conde's lines at Arras, as
related in the _Memoirs_.

On the 25th Nov. 1655, Madame de Sevigne writes to Bussi-Rabutin, relating
an anecdote in which Grammont was a party.

Madame de Motteville relates that Queen Christina rallied the Chevalier de
Grammont on the passion he had then for the Duchesse de Mercoeur, one of
Cardinal Mazarin's nieces; and spared him only on account of the utter
hopelessness of it.

It is about this period we are inclined to place Grammont's first visit to
England; where curiosity, Hamilton informs us, drew him to see so
remarkable a character as Cromwell; but this visit will be a good
starting-place for the next Number.

CELTIC AND LATIN LANGUAGES.

(Vol. viii., pp. 174. 280. 353.; Vol. ix., p. 14.)

    "Professor F. W. Newman, in his little work entitled _Regal Rome_,
    maintains that the old languages of Italy, especially the Umbrian and
    Sabine, contained a striking predominance of Celtic ingredients, and he
    wishes to show that this is still evident even in the Latin of Cicero.
    His proof rests on vocabularies (pp. 19--26.), especially in regard to
    the military, political, and {357} religious words which he supposes
    the Romans derived from the Sabines (p. 61.). With regard to these
    lists, I have to observe, that while all that is valid in the
    comparison merely gives the Indo-Germanic of the Celtic languages--a
    fact beyond dispute--Mr. Newman takes no pains to discriminate between
    the marks of an original identity of root, and those words which the
    Celts of Britain derived from their Roman conquerors."--Donaldson's
    _Varronianus_, p. 64.

    "It is to be remarked, that almost _all the words_ of the British
    tongue agree either with the Greek or Latin. It is this strong
    similarity of features between their own language and those of Greece
    and Italy, that has induced so many of my countrymen to claim for it
    the honour of being the mother-tongue of all, and to scorn all
    examination which did not commence with this confession. Even the late
    learned Dr. Owen Pugh has, in his _Dictionary_, by arbitrarily
    selecting certain syllables as the roots of all Cumrian words, done
    much to foster this overweening conceit. The system was carried to its
    extreme point of absurdity by the Rev. Edward Davies, who by the help
    of such syllables expected to unravel the mysteries of all languages.
    This failure has I hope paved the way for the more sober consideration
    of the question, which, if worked out fairly, will in my opinion
    establish the claim of the Cumrian tongue, if not to be the mother of
    all tongues, at least to be a valuable branch of the Caucasian tree of
    languages. Now, had the two races, the Roman and Cumrian, remained
    always separate, a comparative etymology would have been an easy task;
    for no more would be necessary than to put the similar roots, having
    the same meaning, side by side. But, unfortunately for the scholar who
    undertakes to prove the question, the Romans were in this island four
    hundred years, colonised it partly, and partly gave it their own form
    of civilisation. As before mentioned, the inhabitants adopted with
    avidity the Roman dress, language, and literature. That language must
    therefore be supposed to have entered deeply into the composition of
    the present Cumrian tongue. The sceptical examiner may therefore
    reasonably object, that any similarity between the two languages might
    have originated in the adoption of that of Rome by the British
    provincials. In answer to this I refer in the first place to Lloyd's
    reasoning, quoted in the note," viz. that the same similarity exists
    between the Latin and the Erse [see Newman, in the _Classical Museum_,
    vol. vi.]. "In the second place to the fact, that Wales and Cornwall do
    not appear to have been occupied, like the rest of England, by the
    Romans."... "Still, however, the long residence of the Romans in the
    island, with the known influence always produced by such a state of
    things, renders every statement grounded on the similarity alone of the
    languages of the two races, the conquered and the conquerors, liable to
    suspicion. I have therefore been compelled to enter upon an exceedingly
    difficult investigation, which, if successful, must prove the radical
    identity of the Latin and Cumrian tongues. The proof is this: If there
    are derivative words in the Latin, of which we must seek the primitives
    in the Cumrian, and if these primitives be shown to furnish an
    explanation of many words before inexplicable on etymological
    principles. For example, if the word 'to tread' under various forms be
    found, with the meaning 'to trample with the feet,' in most of the
    western languages of Europe, and have no noun to base itself upon in
    these languages, and yet the noun 'traed the feet' be found in one of
    them, the inference is irresistible that the verb in all its forms was
    derived from this root. To deny this would be equivalent to a denial
    that the Latin verb _calcare_ came from _calx_, 'the heel.' In the
    following list, such words alone, with a few exceptions for the sake of
    etymological illustration, have been introduced. It might have been
    indefinitely extended, but the difficulty was to confine the examples
    within moderate limits."--Williams on _One Source of the Non-Hellenic
    Portion of the Latin Language_.[2]

This eminent scholar supplies sixty-two, with explanatory notes, and
subjoins a list of sixty-three. Under the example "Occo, occare, _to
harrow_," he observes:

    "Persons who wish to draw subtle inferences say that all the terms of
    the Romans connected with agriculture may be referred to a Greek
    source, while the terms expressive of war and hunting are non-Hellenic.
    The induction fails completely in both parts, as might easily be shown.
    When Caesar landed in Britain, the natives were agriculturists, densely
    planted. And Halley proved, that the harvest which Caesar's soldiers
    reaped had ripened at the average period of a Kentish harvest in his
    days. Assuredly then the Britons had not the agricultural names to
    learn from the Romans of an after age."

    "I begin," says Newman, "with the country and domestic animals, which
    will show how very far from the truth Niebuhr was, when he imagined
    that in words connected with 'the gentler pursuits of life' the Roman
    language has peculiarly extensive agreement with the Hellenic."

When your correspondent T. H. T. says--

    "Professor Newman, in his _Regal Rome_, has drawn attention to the
    subject; but his induction does not appear sufficiently extensive to
    warrant any decisive conclusion respecting the position the Celtic
    holds as an element of the Latin,"--

he could not have known that the same writer has, in the sixth volume of
the _Classical Museum_, continued the comparison at great length; and as
that work falls into the hands of but few, I shall transcribe some passages
which may throw light on the subject:

    "It has for some years been recognised, at least by several English
    scholars, that there is a remarkable similarity between the Celtic
    languages and Latin. In the case of Welsh it was, I believe, at first
    supposed that the words must have been introduced by the Roman dominion
    in Britain; but when the likeness was found to exist in the Erse, and
    that the Erse was even more like to Latin (as regards the consonants)
    than the Welsh is, this idea of course fell to {358} the ground. The
    scholar and physiologist, who pressed into notice the strong
    similarities of the Celtic to the European languages, and claimed a
    place for Celtic within that group, Dr. Prichard, has naturally fixed
    his attention with so much strength on the _primitive_ relations of all
    these tongues, as to be jealous and suspicious of an argument, which
    alleges that the one has borrowed from the other. Some ten years ago,
    by his favour, I read a MS. of a vocabulary (the composition of Dr.
    Stratton, formerly of Aberdeen), which compared the Gaelic with the
    Latin tongue in alphabetical order without comment or development. From
    this vocabulary Prichard gives an extract in his chapter on the Italian
    nations, and finds it entirely to confirm his views that the Roman
    language has not suffered any larger admixture by a foreign action.
    What is or was Dr. Stratton's opinion, I never heard. His vocabulary
    first suggested to me the value of this inquiry, and that is all.
    Having now been led to a fuller examination of the Welsh and Gaelic
    dictionaries, I find not only a far greater abundance of material
    (especially in the Welsh) than I could have imagined; but also, that by
    grouping words aright, conclusions result such as I had not expected,
    and adverse to those of Dr. Prichard."

Professor Newman, as T. H. T. has observed, confined himself to a tabular
view of Celtic and Latin words; but the grammatical structure and formal
development of the two languages have not been overlooked in the
philological literature of England. These interesting inquiries have been
pursued by Dr. Prichard, in his elaborate treatise on the _Eastern Origin
of the Celtic Nations_, and the Rev. W. D. Conybeare, (in his _Theological
Lectures delivered in Bristol College in 1831-33_) has shown that it is by
thus analysing the grammatical structure, which forms the very skeleton of
languages, rather than by confining our attention to mere vocabularies,
that we may best detect their true affinities, and has illustrated this
doctrine by a few Welsh examples. In the _West of England Archaeological
Journal_ is exhibited (I believe by the same author) the identity of verbal
forms in the Welsh and Latin languages.

Nevertheless, Archdeacon Williams maintains that two languages may have a
common vocabulary, but different grammars[3]:

    "The Latin language, whether from Pelasgic or Achaean influence, adopted
    at an early period the Hellenic grammar; and, under the skilful hands
    of the bilingual Ennius, became that polished interpreter of thought,
    which yields in regularity and majesty to the Greek alone. The Cumri
    either retained, which is more probable, a still more ancient, or
    invented a grammar, now peculiar to themselves. This, although it be
    simple and scientific in the highest degree, is so completely at
    variance with all the other grammars of the civilised world, that
    scholars who have to acquire it late in life feel the strongest
    repugnance to its forms and principles, and are tempted to regard a
    language more fixed and unchangeable in its principles than any other
    existing, as more slippery and grasp-escaping than the Proteus of the
    Grecian mythology."

Since I wrote these extracts, I have been much gratified by the perusal of
Archdeacon Williams's _Gomer_, which I recommend to all interested in this
inquiry.

_Box Sawdust for Collodion._--The following will be of some use to your
photographic readers:

I find that, by treating box sawdust with nitric and sulphuric acid (in the
same manner as cotton), and then dissolving it in ether, it gives a far
more sensitive collodion than either cotton or paper, and the pictures
produced by it are of unequalled brilliancy.

Can you inform me whether portraits can be taken _for sale_, by the
collodion process, without infringing upon the patents?

_Proportions of Chlorides and Silver._--I trust you will allow me space in
your valuable work for some remarks in reference to an important
photographic query, viz. What are the proportions of chlorides and silver
uniformly suited to give the best positive pictures?

I am led to propose this subject for the consideration of practical
photographists, and, if possible, that amateurs may arrive at something
like a rule to guide them in printing positives that will please.

The necessity of these remarks, to me at least, appear very evident from
the wide space which stands between the proportions proposed by various
operators. MR. LYTE, "N. & Q.," Vol. ix., p. 158., says 42 grains of
chloride and 100 grains of silver to 1 oz. of water. MR. POLLOCK, "N. &Q.,"
Vol. vii., p. 588., says 20 grains chloride, and 90 grains of silver to the
ounce. MR. HOCKIN has 10 grains chloride, silver 60. MR. DELAMOTTE, for
albumenized paper, chloride 60 grains, silver 120. MR. THORNTHWAITE begins
as low as chloride 1/2 grain, and silver 30 grains; and lastly, amidst a long
range of proportions, from 1 grain of chloride to the ounce, and silver 20
grains to the ounce, DR. DIAMOND, a great authority in photography, assures
all that the best results can be obtained by using of chloride 5 grains to
the ounce, and of silver 40 grains to the ounce. If so, let the
photographic world know that the latter proportions are sufficient, and the
others needless, wasteful, and expensive without cause. I trust you agree
with me in thinking that it would be of use to a large number of beginners
to have the proportions best suited for printing positives defined as near
as possible, and not be left to guess at proportions varying from 1/2 grain
to 60 grains, and from 20 to 120. I have written hurriedly, and hope you
will see the object I aim at.

_Photographic Copies of Rembrandt._--The extreme rarity and great pecuniary
value of many of Rembrandt's finest etchings are doubtless well known to
many of our readers, as being such as to put these master-pieces of art
beyond the reach of ordinary purchasers. This series of works, calculated
beyond all others of their kind to delight the possessor, will however,
thanks to photography, soon be obtainable by all admirers of the great
master. Two distinguished French photographers, the brothers MM. Bisson,
have succeeded in obtaining, by means of this wonderful art, copies of a
fidelity attainable by no other process: so that the wondrous lights,
shades, half-tones, and chiaro-obscuro, for which Rembrandt is so
remarkable, are preserved in all their original beauty. The plates will be
accompanied by descriptive letter-press, and by a Biography of Rembrandt
from the pen of M. Charles Blanc. As the works are so numerous, the first
series will consist of forty plates, to be issued in ten livraisons, each
containing four plates, price twenty francs; a very moderate sum, if we
remember that among the works thus to be issued, at a cost of five francs
each, will be found copies of such gems as the _Avocat Tolling_ and the
_Piece de Cent Florins_.

_Coloured Photographs._--I have lately seen, and very much admired, some
specimens of photographic coloured portraits. They have all the broad
effect of the great masters perfectly in detail, and none of the niggling
effect of many coloured photographs, which are in fact specimens of
miniature painting rather than photography--the outline alone being given
by the photographic art. The specimens I refer to appear to have been
soaked in oil, or some transparent varnish, and then coloured in separate
tints, probably from the back; the shadows being _entirely_ photographic.
It is evident they are quickly and easily executed; but I am desirous of
knowing the exact process, and shall be much obliged for information on the
subject.

_Christian Names_ (Vol. vii., pp. 406. 488. 626.).--The earliest instance I
have yet met with, of an individual with two Christian names, occurs in the
compulsory cession of the Abbey of Vale Royal to King Henry VIII.; the deed
conveying which is still extant in the Augmentation Office. It is in Latin,
and signed by John Harwood the Abbot, Alexander Sedon the Prior, _William
Brenck Harrysun_, and twelve other monks of the Abbey. Vale Royal Abbey is
now the seat of Lord Delamere, into whose family it came by purchase in
1616, from the descendant of Sir Thomas Holcroft, the original grantee from
the crown.

I send you a much earlier instance of two Christian names than any that has

_Abigail_ (Vol. iv., pp. 424., &c.; Vol. viii., p. 653.).--Your recent
correspondents on this subject do not appear to have met with the passage
in which I mentioned, that since putting the question, I had found that a
waiting-maid in Beaumont and Fletcher's comedy of _The Scornful Lady_ was
named Abigail; and that, as the play appeared to have been a favourite one,
the application of the name to the class generally was probably owing to
it. In the absence of any proof of its having been previously used in this
sense, I still continue to think that this conjecture was well founded.
Considering the terms on which Dean Swift was with the Mashams, he was the
last person in the world to have used such a term, unless it had been so
long in familiar use as to be deprived of all appearance of personal
allusion to them.

"_Begging the question_" (Vol. viii., p. 640.).--This phrase is identical

of that time. I hope this subject may be well ventilated, as considerable
misapprehension exists about it.

_Garble_ (Vol. ix., p. 243.).--Your correspondent E. S. T. T. was mistaken
when he said that the "corrupt" meaning of the word _garble_ is now the
only one ever used. In proof of this I would give one instance, familiar to
me, in which it still retains its "good" signification. In "working"
cochineal, spices, and other similar merchandise at the warehouse in which
they are stored upon their arrival in this country, the operation of {360}
sifting and separating the good from the bad is termed _garbling_: the word
being here employed in the very same sense as in the examples quoted by
E. S. T. T., illustrative of its original meaning, and which sense he
erroneously stated it no longer possessed.

R. V. T.

Mincing Lane.

I cannot agree with your correspondent E. S. T. T., that a corruption of
meaning has taken place in this word; and that whereas it originally meant
a selection of the good and a discarding of the bad parts of anything, its
present meaning, is exactly the reverse of this. Its original signification
is correctly stated: the garbling of spices, drugs, &c., meant the
selection of the good and the rejection of the bad. But the garbling of a
passage cited as a testimony is a precisely analogous process. The person
who garbles the passage omits those parts which can be used against his
view, and adduces only those parts which support his conclusion. He selects
the parts which are good, and rejects those which are bad, _for his
purpose_. When a passage is said to be garbled, it is always implied that
the person who quotes it has suppressed a portion which tells against
himself; but that portion is, so far as he is concerned, the _bad_, not the
_good_ portion. The secondary and metaphorical is therefore precisely
analogous to the primary and literal sense of the word, and not the reverse
of it.

_Electric Telegraph_ (Vol. ix., p. 270.).--As every new attempt to improve
this invaluable invention, and to extend its use, is of world-wide
importance, the following extract from _La Presse_, a French newspaper of
March 23rd, will excite inquiry:

    "On ecrit de Berne, le 17 Mars, MM. Brunner et Hipp, directeurs des
    telegraphes electriques de la Suisse, viennent d'inventer un appareil
    portatif a l'aide duquel, en l'appliquant a un point quelconque des
    fils telegraphiques, on peut transmettre une depeche. L'essai de cet
    appareil a ete fait a deux lieues de Berne, dans un lieu ou il n'existe
    aucune section de telegraphie."

The writer goes on to say that the experiment had been tested with success
on the lines to Zurich, Basle, Geneva, &c.

_Butler's "Lives of the Saints"_ (Vol. viii., p.387.).--The inquiry
respecting the various editions of this valuable work not having yet
received any answer, the following information may in some degree satisfy
the inquirer. The first edition of the Rev. Alban Butler's _Lives of the
Saints_ was published in the author's lifetime, at various intervals from
1754 to 1759, when the last of the four volumes appeared, of which the
edition was composed. Part II. of vol. iii. is now before me, with the date
1758. No other edition appeared till after the death of the learned and
pious author, which took place in 1773.

The second edition was undertaken by the most Rev. Dr. Carpenter, Roman
Catholic Archbishop of Dublin, and appeared in 12 vols. in 1779. It is
stated in the title-page to be "corrected and enlarged from the author's
own MS." It did contain all the notes omitted in the previous edition, and
other matter prepared by the author. The third edition was published in
Scotland, and other editions followed; but I am unable to give any
particulars of them. But the splendid stereotype edition, published in
London by Murphy, in 1812, in 12 vols., is by far the best ever produced,
or ever likely to appear. Since this there have been other editions; one in
2 vols., published in Ireland, and a cheap edition in 12 small vols.,
printed at Derby; but they deserve little notice.

_Anticipatory Use of the Cross_ (Vol. viii. _passim_).--In answer to
particular inquiry, I have been furnished by a resident in Macao with an
answer, of which the following is the substance:--The cross is commonly
used in China, and consists of any flat boards of sufficient size, the
upright shaft being usually eight to ten feet high. The transverse bar is
fixed by a single nail or rivet, and is therefore often loose, and may be
made sometimes to traverse a complete circle. It is not so much an
instrument of punishment in itself, as it is an operation-board whereon to
confine the criminal, not with nails, but ropes, to undergo--as in the case
of a woman taken in adultery--the cutting away of the flesh from the bosom.
He adds, that he has witnessed such punishment, and he has no doubt that
the cross has been used in this way in China immemorially. Any of your
correspondents will much oblige me by correcting or confirming this
statement from positive testimony.

_The Marquis of Granby_ (Vol. ix., p. 127.).--A portrait of this nobleman
constitutes the sign of a public-house at Doncaster, and of another at
Bawtry, nine miles from that town. His lordship, it is said, occasionally
occupied Carr House, near the former place, as a hunting-box in the middle
of the last century. As an instance of his lordship's popularity, I may
here add, that out of compliment to him, and for his greater convenience in
hunting, at a period when there was a considerable extent of uninclosed and
undrained country around Doncaster, the corporation directed several banks
and passages to be made on their estate at Rossington; and in 1752, that
body likewise presented the Marquis with the freedom of the borough.

R., What is the authority for stating that the Rev. John Cawley, rector of
Didcot, was a son of Cawley the regicide? I send you the following extract
from Wood's _Athenae_ (Bliss's edition), vol. iv. col. 580.:

    "John Cawley, son of Will. Cawley of the city of Chichester, gent.,
    was, by the endeavours of his father, made Fellow of All Souls' College
    (from that of Magdalen) by the visitors appointed by Parliament, anno
    1649; took the degrees in arts, that of Master being completed in 1654;
    and whether he became a preacher soon after, without any orders
    conferred on him by a bishop, I cannot tell. Sure I am, that after his
    Majesty's restoration, he became a great loyalist, disowned the former
    actions of his father, who had been one of the judges of King Charles
    I.; when he was tryed for his life by a pretended court of justice,
    rayled at him (being then living in a skulking condition beyond sea);
    and took all opportunities to free himself from having any hand or
    anything to do in the times of usurpation. About which time, having
    married one of the daughters of Mr. Pollard of Newnham Courtney, he
    became rector of Dedcot, or Dudcot, in Berkshire; rector of Henley in
    Oxfordshire; and in the beginning of March, 1666, Archdeacon of
    Lincoln."

_New Zealander and Westminster Bridge_ (Vol. ix., pp. 74. 159.).--Your
correspondents have traced this celebrated passage to a letter from Horace
Walpole to Sir H. Mann, and to passages in poems by Mrs. Barbauld and Kirke
White. It appears to me that the following extract from the Preface to
P. B. Shelley's _Peter Bell the Third_, has more resemblance to it. It is
addressed to Moore:

    "Hoping that the immortality which you have given to the Fudges you
    will receive from them; and in the firm expectation, that when London
    shall be an habitation of bitterns, when St. Paul's and Westminster
    Abbey shall stand shapeless and nameless ruins, in the midst of an
    unpeopled marsh; when the piers of Westminster Bridge shall become the
    nuclei of islets of reeds and osiers, and cast the jagged shadows of
    their broken arches on the solitary stream; some transatlantic
    commentator will be weighing in the scales of some new and now
    unimagined system of criticism, the respective merits of the Bells, and
    the Fudges, and their historians."

Several passages from different writers having been mentioned in your
columns as likely to have suggested to our brilliant essayist and historian
his celebrated graphic sketch of the New Zealander meditating over the
ruins of London, I would beg leave to hint the probability that not one of
those many passages were present to his mind or memory at the moment he
wrote. The fact is that the picture is so true to nature, and has been so
often sketched, and the associations and reflections arising from it so
often felt and described, that I cannot for a moment admit the insinuation
of a charge of plagiarism, or even unconscious adaptation of another's
thoughts in one so abundantly stored with imagery of his own, that the very
overflowings of his own wealth would enrich a generation of writers. It has
however occurred to me that his classic mind might have remembered the
picture of Marius amid the ruins of Carthage, or, more probably, the still
more striking passage in the celebrated letter of Sulpicius to Cicero, on
the death of his daughter Tullia, in which he describes himself, on his
return from Asia, as sailing from AEgina towards Megara, and contemplating
the surrounding countries:

    "Behind me lay AEgina, before me Megara; on my right I saw Piraeus, and
    on my left Corinth. These cities, once so flourishing and magnificent,
    now presented nothing to my view but a sad spectacle of desolation."

And he then proceeds with his melancholy reflections on so many perishing
memorials of human glory and grandeur in so small a compass.

_Misapplication of Terms_ (Vol. ix., p. 44.).--I cannot pretend to set up
my judgment against that of MR. SQUEERS, who has in his favour the
proverbial wisdom of the Schools. Riddle, however, who I believe is an
authority, gives the word LEGO no such meaning as "to hearken." If Plautus
uses the word in that sense, as it is an uncommon one, the passage should
have been quoted, or a reference given. The meaning of {362} the word
appears to be "to collect, run over, see, read, choose." In justification
of my criticism, and in reply to MR. SQUEERS, I shall quote Horne Tooke's
remark, in speaking of "[Greek: ta deonta], or things which ought to be
done;" _Div. Purley_, Pt. II. ch. viii. (vol. ii. pp. 499-501., edit.
1849):

    "The first of these, LEGEND, which means _That which ought to be read_,
    is, from the early misapplication of the term by impostors, now used by
    us as if it meant, _That which ought to be laughed at_. And so it is
    explained in our Dictionaries."

At the hazard of being again deemed hypercritical, while on this subject,
_the misapplication of terms_, I must question the correctness of the
phrase "_Under_ the _circum_stance." A thing must be _in_ or _amidst_ its
_circum_-stances; it cannot be _under_ them. I admit the commonness of the
expression, but it is not the less a solecism. Can you inform me when it
was introduced? I hope it is not old enough to be considered inveterate.
The best authors write "in the circumstances;" and yet so prevalent is the
anomaly, that in a very respectable periodical, not long since, the French
"_dans_ les circonstances presentes," given as a quotation, is rendered
"_Under_ the present circumstances."

published anonymously in 1709, in retaliation of Edward Holdsworth's
_Muscipula_. "Hoglandia" is Hampshire, and Holdsworth probably was a
Hampshire man, for he was educated at Winchester, and we may presume the
anonymous author to have been a Cambro-Briton.

W. A. W. (Brighton). _The specked appearance is entirely owing to your
having the wrong paper for your negatives. When Turner's paper is really
good it is invaluable, but the specks so abundant in it are a great
drawback._

H. H. (Glasgow). _We think a practical lesson from some _experienced_ hand
would put you right in all your little failures. It is evident from your
perseverance that great success will ultimately attend you. It is very
difficult to describe all the minutiae by correspondence._

A SUBSCRIBER (Atherstone). _1. We think your failures appear to arise from
defective iodized paper. If the least portion of iodide of potash remains,
the browning will take place; or the acetic acid may not be pure: add a
little more. 2. If the least portion of hypo. contaminates your silver
solutions, they are useless; to reduce it to its metallic state again is
the only remedy. 3. The views taken_ instantaneously _are with collodion.
It may be applied equally well upon paper as glass; and the advantage of
paper negatives is very great over glass_.

PHOTOGRAPHY.--_We hope next week to lay before our readers the particulars
of a new process, combining all the advantages of the_ waxed-paper, _but
without its difficulties and uncertainties_.

pleasure in bearing testimony to their merits and capabilities. It appears
to us impossible to produce instruments of the same size possessing a

The SCALE OF PREMIUMS adopted by this Office will be found of a very
moderate character, but at the same time quite adequate to the risk
incurred.

FOUR-FIFTHS, or 80 per cent. of the Profits, are assigned to Policies
_every fifth year_, and may be applied to increase the sum insured, to an
immediate payment in cash, or to the reduction and ultimate extinction of
future Premiums.

ONE-THIRD of the Premium on Insurances of 500l. and upwards, for the whole
term of life, may remain as a debt upon the Policy, to be paid off at
convenience; or the Directors will lend sums of 50l. and upwards, on the
security of Policies effected with this Company for the whole term of life,
when they have acquired an adequate value.

SECURITY.--Those who effect Insurances with this Company are protected by
its Subscribed Capital of 750,000l., of which nearly 140,000l. is invested,
from the risk incurred by Members of Mutual Societies.

The satisfactory financial condition of the Company, exclusive of the
Subscribed and Invested Capital, will be seen by the following Statement:

  On the 31st October, 1853, the sums
  Assured, including Bonus added,
  amounted to                          L2,500,000

  The Premium Fund to more than           800,000

  And the Annual Income from the
  same source, to                         109,000

Insurances, without participation in Profits, may be effected at reduced
rates.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
