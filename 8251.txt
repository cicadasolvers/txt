Book 24 Jeremiah
001:001 The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests
        who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:
001:002 to whom the word of Yahweh came in the days of Josiah the son
        of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.
001:003 It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah,
        king of Judah, to the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah,
        the son of Josiah, king of Judah, to the carrying away
        of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.
001:004 Now the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
001:005 Before I formed you in the belly I knew you, and before you
        came forth out of the womb I sanctified you; I have appointed
        you a prophet to the nations.
001:006 Then said I, Ah, Lord Yahweh! behold, I don't know how to speak;
        for I am a child.
001:007 But Yahweh said to me, Don't say, I am a child; for to whoever I
        shall send you, you shall go, and whatever I shall command you,
        you shall speak.
001:008 Don't be afraid because of them; for I am with you to
        deliver you, says Yahweh.
001:009 Then Yahweh put forth his hand, and touched my mouth; and Yahweh
        said to me, Behold, I have put my words in your mouth:
001:010 behold, I have this day set you over the nations and over
        the kingdoms, to pluck up and to break down and to destroy
        and to overthrow, to build and to plant.
001:011 Moreover the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, Jeremiah,
        what see you?  I said, I see a rod of an almond tree.
001:012 Then said Yahweh to me, You have well seen:  for I watch
        over my word to perform it.
001:013 The word of Yahweh came to me the second time, saying, What see you?
        I said, I see a boiling caldron; and the face of it is
        from the north.
001:014 Then Yahweh said to me, Out of the north evil shall break
        forth on all the inhabitants of the land.
001:015 For, behold, I will call all the families of the kingdoms
        of the north, says Yahweh; and they shall come, and they
        shall set everyone his throne at the entrance of the gates
        of Jerusalem, and against all the walls of it round about,
        and against all the cities of Judah.
001:016 I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness,
        in that they have forsaken me, and have burned incense
        to other gods, and worshiped the works of their own hands.
001:017 You therefore gird up your waist, and arise, and speak
        to them all that I command you:  don't be dismayed at them,
        lest I dismay you before them.
001:018 For, behold, I have made you this day a fortified city,
        and an iron pillar, and bronze walls, against the whole land,
        against the kings of Judah, against the princes of it,
        against the priests of it, and against the people of the land.
001:019 They shall fight against you; but they shall not prevail against you:
        for I am with you, says Yahweh, to deliver you.
002:001 The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
002:002 Go, and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus says
        Yahweh, I remember for you the kindness of your youth, the love
        of your weddings; how you went after me in the wilderness,
        in a land that was not sown.
002:003 Israel [was] holiness to Yahweh, the first fruits of his increase:
        all who devour him shall be held guilty; evil shall come
        on them, says Yahweh.
002:004 Hear you the word of Yahweh, O house of Jacob, and all the families
        of the house of Israel:
002:005 thus says Yahweh, What unrighteousness have your fathers found in me,
        that they have gone far from me, and have walked after vanity,
        and are become vain?
002:006 Neither said they, Where is Yahweh who brought us up out
        of the land of Egypt, who led us through the wilderness,
        through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of
        drought and of the shadow of death, through a land that none
        passed through, and where no man lived?
002:007 I brought you into a plentiful land, to eat the fruit of it and
        the goodness of it; but when you entered, you defiled my land,
        and made my heritage an abomination.
002:008 The priests didn't say, Where is Yahweh? and those who handle
        the law didn't know me:  the rulers also transgressed against me,
        and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things
        that do not profit.
002:009 Therefore I will yet contend with you, says Yahweh, and with
        your children's children will I contend.
002:010 For pass over to the islands of Kittim, and see; and send
        to Kedar, and consider diligently; and see if there has been
        such a thing.
002:011 Has a nation changed [its] gods, which yet are no gods? but my
        people have changed their glory for that which does not profit.
002:012 Be astonished, you heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid,
        be you very desolate, says Yahweh.
002:013 For my people have committed two evils:  they have forsaken me,
        the spring of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns,
        broken cisterns, that can hold no water.
002:014 Is Israel a servant? is he a native-born [slave]? why is
        he become a prey?
002:015 The young lions have roared on him, and yelled; and they have made
        his land waste:  his cities are burned up, without inhabitant.
002:016 The children also of Memphis and Tahpanhes have broken the crown
        of your head.
002:017 Haven't you procured this to yourself, in that you have forsaken
        Yahweh your God, when he led you by the way?
002:018 Now what have you to do in the way to Egypt, to drink the waters
        of the Shihor? or what have you to do in the way to Assyria,
        to drink the waters of the River?
002:019 Your own wickedness shall correct you, and your backsliding
        shall reprove you:  know therefore and see that it is an evil
        thing and a bitter, that you have forsaken Yahweh your God,
        and that my fear is not in you, says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies.
002:020 For of old time I have broken your yoke, and burst your bonds;
        and you said, I will not serve; for on every high hill and under
        every green tree you did bow yourself, playing the prostitute.
002:021 Yet I had planted you a noble vine, wholly a right seed:
        how then are you turned into the degenerate branches of a
        foreign vine to me?
002:022 For though you wash yourself with lye, and use much soap,
        yet your iniquity is marked before me, says the Lord Yahweh.
002:023 How can you say, I am not defiled, I have not gone after
        the Baals? see your way in the valley, know what you have done:
        [you are] a swift dromedary traversing her ways;
002:024 a wild donkey used to the wilderness, that snuffs up the wind
        in her desire; in her occasion who can turn her away? all
        those who seek her will not weary themselves; in her month
        they shall find her.
002:025 Withhold your foot from being unshod, and your throat from thirst:
        but you said, It is in vain; no, for I have loved strangers,
        and after them will I go.
002:026 As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house
        of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their princes,
        and their priests, and their prophets;
002:027 who tell a stock, You are my father; and to a stone, You have
        brought me forth:  for they have turned their back to me,
        and not their face; but in the time of their trouble they
        will say, Arise, and save us.
002:028 But where are your gods that you have made you? let them arise,
        if they can save you in the time of your trouble:
        for according to the number of your cities are your gods, Judah.
002:029 Why will you contend with me? you all have transgressed
        against me, says Yahweh.
002:030 In vain have I struck your children; they received no correction:
        your own sword has devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.
002:031 Generation, see the word of Yahweh.  Have I been a wilderness
        to Israel? or a land of thick darkness? why say my people,
        We are broken loose; we will come no more to you?
002:032 Can a virgin forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? yet
        my people have forgotten me days without number.
002:033 How trimmest you your way to seek love! therefore even the wicked
        women have you taught your ways.
002:034 Also in your skirts is found the blood of the souls
        of the innocent poor:  you did not find them breaking in;
        but it is because of all these things.
002:035 Yet you said, I am innocent; surely his anger is turned away
        from me.  Behold, I will enter into judgment with you,
        because you say, I have not sinned.
002:036 Why go you about so much to change your way? you shall be
        ashamed of Egypt also, as you were ashamed of Assyria.
002:037 From there also shall you go forth, with your hands on your head:
        for Yahweh has rejected those in whom you trust, and you
        shall not prosper with them.
003:001 They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him,
        and become another man's, will he return to her again?
        Won't that land be greatly polluted?  But you have played
        the prostitute with many lovers; yet return again
        to me, says Yahweh.
003:002 Lift up your eyes to the bare heights, and see; where have
        you not been lain with?  By the ways have you sat for them,
        as an Arabian in the wilderness; and you have polluted the land
        with your prostitution and with your wickedness.
003:003 Therefore the showers have been withheld, and there has
        been no latter rain; yet you have a prostitute's forehead,
        you refused to be ashamed.
003:004 Will you not from this time cry to me, My Father, you are
        the guide of my youth?
003:005 Will he retain [his anger] forever? will he keep it to the end?
        Behold, you have spoken and have done evil things, and have
        had your way.
003:006 Moreover Yahweh said to me in the days of Josiah the king,
        Have you seen that which backsliding Israel has done? she
        is gone up on every high mountain and under every green tree,
        and there has played the prostitute.
003:007 I said after she had done all these things, She will return to me;
        but she didn't return:  and her treacherous sister Judah saw it.
003:008 I saw, when, for this very cause that backsliding Israel had
        committed adultery, I had put her away and given her a bill
        of divorce, yet treacherous Judah, her sister, didn't fear;
        but she also went and played the prostitute.
003:009 It happened through the lightness of her prostitution,
        that the land was polluted, and she committed adultery
        with stones and with stocks.
003:010 Yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah has not returned
        to me with her whole heart, but only in pretense, says Yahweh.
003:011 Yahweh said to me, Backsliding Israel has shown herself more
        righteous than treacherous Judah.
003:012 Go, and proclaim these words toward the north, and say,
        Return, you backsliding Israel, says Yahweh; I will not look
        in anger on you; for I am merciful, says Yahweh, I will not
        keep [anger] forever.
003:013 Only acknowledge your iniquity, that you have transgressed
        against Yahweh your God, and have scattered your ways to
        the strangers under every green tree, and you have not obeyed
        my voice, says Yahweh.
003:014 Return, backsliding children, says Yahweh; for I am a husband to you:
        and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family,
        and I will bring you to Zion:
003:015 and I will give you shepherds according to my heart, who shall
        feed you with knowledge and understanding.
003:016 It shall come to pass, when you are multiplied and increased
        in the land, in those days, says Yahweh, they shall say no more,
        The ark of the covenant of Yahweh; neither shall it come to mind;
        neither shall they remember it; neither shall they miss it;
        neither shall it be made any more.
003:017 At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of Yahweh;
        and all the nations shall be gathered to it, to the name
        of Yahweh, to Jerusalem:  neither shall they walk any more
        after the stubbornness of their evil heart.
003:018 In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house
        of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land
        of the north to the land that I gave for an inheritance
        to your fathers.
003:019 But I said, How I will put you among the children, and give
        you a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the armies
        of the nations! and I said, You shall call me My Father,
        and shall not turn away from following me.
003:020 Surely as a wife treacherously departs from her husband, so have
        you dealt treacherously with me, house of Israel, says Yahweh.
003:021 A voice is heard on the bare heights, the weeping [and]
        the petitions of the children of Israel; because they have
        perverted their way, they have forgotten Yahweh their God.
003:022 Return, you backsliding children, I will heal your backsliding.
        Behold, we are come to you; for you are Yahweh our God.
003:023 Truly in vain is [the help that is looked for] from the hills,
        the tumult on the mountains:  truly in Yahweh our God is
        the salvation of Israel.
003:024 But the shameful thing has devoured the labor of our fathers
        from our youth, their flocks and their herds, their sons
        and their daughters.
003:025 Let us lie down in our shame, and let our confusion cover us;
        for we have sinned against Yahweh our God, we and our fathers,
        from our youth even to this day; and we have not obeyed
        the voice of Yahweh our God.
004:001 If you will return, Israel, says Yahweh, if you will return to me,
        and if you will put away your abominations out of my sight;
        then you shall not be removed;
004:002 and you shall swear, As Yahweh lives, in truth, in justice,
        and in righteousness; and the nations shall bless themselves
        in him, and in him shall they glory.
004:003 For thus says Yahweh to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem, Break up
        your fallow ground, and don't sow among thorns.
004:004 Circumcise yourselves to Yahweh, and take away the foreskins
        of your heart, you men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem;
        lest my wrath go forth like fire, and burn so that none can
        quench it, because of the evil of your doings.
004:005 Declare you in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say,
        Blow you the trumpet in the land:  cry aloud and say,
        Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the fortified cities.
004:006 Set up a standard toward Zion:  flee for safety, don't stay;
        for I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction.
004:007 A lion is gone up from his thicket, and a destroyer of nations;
        he is on his way, he is gone forth from his place, to make your
        land desolate, that your cities be laid waste, without inhabitant.
004:008 For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and wail;
        for the fierce anger of Yahweh hasn't turned back from us.
004:009 It shall happen at that day, says Yahweh, that the heart
        of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes;
        and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall wonder.
004:010 Then said I, Ah, Lord Yahweh! surely you have greatly deceived
        this people and Jerusalem, saying, You shall have peace;
        whereas the sword reaches to the life.
004:011 At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A hot
        wind from the bare heights in the wilderness toward the daughter
        of my people, not to winnow, nor to cleanse;
004:012 a full wind from these shall come for me:  now will I also utter
        judgments against them.
004:013 Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots [shall
        be] as the whirlwind:  his horses are swifter than eagles.
        Woe to us! for we are ruined.
004:014 Jerusalem, wash your heart from wickedness, that you may be saved.
        How long shall your evil thoughts lodge within you?
004:015 For a voice declares from Dan, and publishes evil from
        the hills of Ephraim:
004:016 make you mention to the nations; behold, publish against Jerusalem,
        [that] watchers come from a far country, and give out their
        voice against the cities of Judah.
004:017 As keepers of a field are they against her round about,
        because she has been rebellious against me, says Yahweh.
004:018 Your way and your doings have procured these things to you;
        this is your wickedness; for it is bitter, for it reaches
        to your heart.
004:019 My anguish, my anguish!  I am pained at my very heart;
        my heart is disquieted in me; I can't hold my peace;
        because you have heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet,
        the alarm of war.
004:020 Destruction on destruction is cried; for the whole land is
        laid waste:  suddenly are my tents destroyed, [and] my curtains
        in a moment.
004:021 How long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound
        of the trumpet?
004:022 For my people are foolish, they don't know me; they are
        foolish children, and they have no understanding; they are
        wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.
004:023 I saw the earth, and, behold, it was waste and void;
        and the heavens, and they had no light.
004:024 I saw the mountains, and behold, they trembled, and all the hills
        moved back and forth.
004:025 I saw, and behold, there was no man, and all the birds
        of the sky were fled.
004:026 I saw, and behold, the fruitful field was a wilderness, and all
        the cities of it were broken down at the presence of Yahweh,
        [and] before his fierce anger.
004:027 For thus says Yahweh, The whole land shall be a desolation;
        yet will I not make a full end.
004:028 For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black;
        because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and I have
        not repented, neither will I turn back from it.
004:029 Every city flees for the noise of the horsemen and archers;
        they go into the thickets, and climb up on the rocks:
        every city is forsaken, and not a man dwells therein.
004:030 You, when you are made desolate, what will you do?
        Though you clothe yourself with scarlet, though you deck you
        with ornaments of gold, though you enlarge your eyes with paint,
        in vain do you make yourself beautiful; [your] lovers despise you,
        they seek your life.
004:031 For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail,
        the anguish as of her who brings forth her first child,
        the voice of the daughter of Zion, who gasps for breath,
        who spreads her hands, [saying], Woe is me now! for my soul
        faints before the murderers.
005:001 Run you back and forth through the streets of Jerusalem,
        and see now, and know, and seek in the broad places of it,
        if you can find a man, if there are any who does justly,
        who seeks truth; and I will pardon her.
005:002 Though they say, As Yahweh lives; surely they swear falsely.
005:003 O Yahweh, don't your eyes look on truth? you have stricken them,
        but they were not grieved; you have consumed them, but they
        have refused to receive correction:  they have made their faces
        harder than a rock; they have refused to return.
005:004 Then I said, Surely these are poor; they are foolish; for they
        don't know the way of Yahweh, nor the law of their God:
005:005 I will get me to the great men, and will speak to them;
        for they know the way of Yahweh, and the law of their God.
        But these with one accord have broken the yoke,
        and burst the bonds.
005:006 Therefore a lion out of the forest shall kill them, a wolf
        of the evenings shall destroy them, a leopard shall watch
        against their cities; everyone who goes out there shall
        be torn in pieces; because their transgressions are many,
        [and] their backsliding is increased.
005:007 How can I pardon you? your children have forsaken me, and sworn
        by them that are no gods:  when I had fed them to the full,
        they committed adultery, and assembled themselves in troops
        at the prostitutes' houses.
005:008 They were as fed horses roaming at large; everyone neighed
        after his neighbor's wife.
005:009 Shall I not visit for these things? says Yahweh; and shall
        not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
005:010 Go up on her walls, and destroy; but don't make a full end:
        take away her branches; for they are not Yahweh's.
005:011 For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt
        very treacherously against me, says Yahweh.
005:012 They have denied Yahweh, and said, It is not he; neither shall
        evil come on us; neither shall we see sword nor famine:
005:013 and the prophets shall become wind, and the word is not in them:
        thus shall it be done to them.
005:014 Therefore thus says Yahweh, the God of Armies, Because you speak
        this word, behold, I will make my words in your mouth fire,
        and this people wood, and it shall devour them.
005:015 Behold, I will bring a nation on you from far, house of Israel,
        says Yahweh:  it is a mighty nation, it is an ancient nation,
        a nation whose language you don't know, neither understand
        what they say.
005:016 Their quiver is an open tomb, they are all mighty men.
005:017 They shall eat up your harvest, and your bread, [which] your sons
        and your daughters should eat; they shall eat up your flocks
        and your herds; they shall eat up your vines and your fig trees;
        they shall beat down your fortified cities, in which you trust,
        with the sword.
005:018 But even in those days, says Yahweh, I will not make a full
        end with you.
005:019 It shall happen, when you shall say, Why has Yahweh our God
        done all these things to us? then shall you say to them,
        Like as you have forsaken me, and served foreign gods in your land,
        so shall you serve strangers in a land that is not yours.
005:020 Declare you this in the house of Jacob, and publish it
        in Judah, saying,
005:021 Hear now this, foolish people, and without understanding;
        who have eyes, and don't see; who have ears, and don't hear:
005:022 Don't you fear me? says Yahweh:  won't you tremble at my presence,
        who have placed the sand for the bound of the sea,
        by a perpetual decree, that it can't pass it? and though
        the waves of it toss themselves, yet they can't prevail;
        though they roar, yet they can't pass over it.
005:023 But this people has a revolting and a rebellious heart;
        they are revolted and gone.
005:024 Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear Yahweh our God,
        who gives rain, both the former and the latter, in its season;
        who preserves to us the appointed weeks of the harvest.
005:025 Your iniquities have turned away these things, and your sins
        have withheld good from you.
005:026 For among my people are found wicked men:  they watch,
        as fowlers lie in wait; they set a trap, they catch men.
005:027 As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit:
        therefore they are become great, and grew rich.
005:028 They are grew fat, they shine:  yes, they overpass in deeds
        of wickedness; they don't plead the cause, the cause
        of the fatherless, that they may prosper; and the right
        of the needy they don't judge.
005:029 Shall I not visit for these things? says Yahweh; shall not my
        soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
005:030 A wonderful and horrible thing is happen in the land:
005:031 the prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule
        by their means; and my people love to have it so:
        and what will you do in the end of it?
006:001 Flee for safety, you children of Benjamin, out of the midst
        of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and raise up
        a signal on Beth Haccherem; for evil looks forth from the north,
        and a great destruction.
006:002 The comely and delicate one, the daughter of Zion, will I cut off.
006:003 Shepherds with their flocks shall come to her; they shall
        pitch their tents against her round about; they shall feed
        everyone in his place.
006:004 Prepare you war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon.
        Woe to us! for the day declines, for the shadows of the evening
        are stretched out.
006:005 Arise, and let us go up by night, and let us destroy her palaces.
006:006 For thus has Yahweh of Armies said, Hew you down trees, and cast
        up a mound against Jerusalem:  this is the city to be visited;
        she is wholly oppression in the midst of her.
006:007 As a well casts forth its waters, so she casts forth her wickedness:
        violence and destruction is heard in her; before me continually
        is sickness and wounds.
006:008 Be instructed, Jerusalem, lest my soul be alienated from you;
        lest I make you a desolation, a land not inhabited.
006:009 Thus says Yahweh of Armies, They shall thoroughly glean
        the remnant of Israel as a vine:  turn again your hand
        as a grape gatherer into the baskets.
006:010 To whom shall I speak and testify, that they may hear? behold,
        their ear is uncircumcised, and they can't listen:
        behold, the word of Yahweh is become to them a reproach;
        they have no delight in it.
006:011 Therefore I am full of the wrath of Yahweh; I am weary
        with holding in:  pour it out on the children in the street,
        and on the assembly of young men together; for even the husband
        with the wife shall be taken, the aged with him who is
        full of days.
006:012 Their houses shall be turned to others, their fields and their
        wives together; for I will stretch out my hand on the inhabitants
        of the land, says Yahweh.
006:013 For from the least of them even to the greatest of them
        everyone is given to covetousness; and from the prophet
        even to the priest everyone deals falsely.
006:014 They have healed also the hurt of my people slightly,
        saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.
006:015 Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay,
        they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush:
        therefore they shall fall among those who fall; at the time
        that I visit them they shall be cast down, says Yahweh.
006:016 Thus says Yahweh, Stand you in the ways and see, and ask
        for the old paths, where is the good way; and walk therein,
        and you shall find rest for your souls:  but they said,
        We will not walk [therein].
006:017 I set watchmen over you, [saying], Listen to the sound of the trumpet;
        but they said, We will not listen.
006:018 Therefore hear, you nations, and know, congregation,
        what is among them.
006:019 Hear, earth:  behold, I will bring evil on this people,
        even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not listened
        to my words; and as for my law, they have rejected it.
006:020 To what purpose comes there to me frankincense from Sheba,
        and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt offerings
        are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices pleasing to me.
006:021 Therefore thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will lay stumbling blocks
        before this people; and the fathers and the sons together shall
        stumble against them; the neighbor and his friend shall perish.
006:022 Thus says Yahweh, Behold, a people comes from the north country;
        and a great nation shall be stirred up from the uttermost
        parts of the earth.
006:023 They lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy;
        their voice roars like the sea, and they ride on horses,
        everyone set in array, as a man to the battle, against you,
        daughter of Zion.
006:024 We have heard the report of it; our hands wax feeble:
        anguish has taken hold of us, [and] pangs as of a woman in travail.
006:025 Don't go forth into the field, nor walk by the way;
        for the sword of the enemy, [and] terror, are on every side.
006:026 Daughter of my people, gird you with sackcloth, and wallow
        yourself in ashes:  make you mourning, as for an only son,
        most bitter lamentation; for the destroyer shall suddenly
        come on us.
006:027 I have made you a tester of metals [and] a fortress among my people;
        that you may know and try their way.
006:028 They are all grievous rebels, going about with slanders;
        they are brass and iron:  they all of them deal corruptly.
006:029 The bellows blow fiercely; the lead is consumed of the fire:
        in vain do they go on refining; for the wicked are
        not plucked away.
006:030 Refuse silver shall men them, because Yahweh has rejected them.
007:001 The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,
007:002 Stand in the gate of Yahweh's house, and proclaim there
        this word, and say, Hear the word of Yahweh, all you of Judah,
        who enter in at these gates to worship Yahweh.
007:003 Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, Amend your ways
        and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place.
007:004 Don't you trust in lying words, saying, The temple of Yahweh,
        the temple of Yahweh, the temple of Yahweh, are these.
007:005 For if you thoroughly amend your ways and your doings;
        if you thoroughly execute justice between a man and his neighbor;
007:006 if you don't oppress the foreigner, the fatherless,
        and the widow, and don't shed innocent blood in this place,
        neither walk after other gods to your own hurt:
007:007 then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land
        that I gave to your fathers, from of old even forevermore.
007:008 Behold, you trust in lying words, that can't profit.
007:009 Will you steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely,
        and burn incense to Baal, and walk after other gods that you
        have not known,
007:010 and come and stand before me in this house, which is called
        by my name, and say, We are delivered; that you may do
        all these abominations?
007:011 Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers
        in your eyes?  Behold, I, even I, have seen it, says Yahweh.
007:012 But go you now to my place which was in Shiloh, where I caused
        my name to dwell at the first, and see what I did to it
        for the wickedness of my people Israel.
007:013 Now, because you have done all these works, says Yahweh, and I
        spoke to you, rising up early and speaking, but you didn't hear;
        and I called you, but you didn't answer:
007:014 therefore will I do to the house which is called by my name,
        in which you trust, and to the place which I gave to you
        and to your fathers, as I did to Shiloh.
007:015 I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all
        your brothers, even the whole seed of Ephraim.
007:016 Therefore don't you pray for this people, neither lift up
        a cry nor prayer for them, neither make intercession to me;
        for I will not hear you.
007:017 Don't you see what they do in the cities of Judah and in
        the streets of Jerusalem?
007:018 The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire,
        and the women knead the dough, to make cakes to the queen
        of the sky, and to pour out drink offerings to other gods,
        that they may provoke me to anger.
007:019 Do they provoke me to anger? says Yahweh; [do they] not
        [provoke] themselves, to the confusion of their own faces?
007:020 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Behold, my anger and my
        wrath shall be poured out on this place, on man, and on animal,
        and on the trees of the field, and on the fruit of the ground;
        and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched.
007:021 Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel:  Add your burnt
        offerings to your sacrifices, and eat meat.
007:022 For I didn't speak to your fathers, nor command them in the day
        that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt
        offerings or sacrifices:
007:023 but this thing I commanded them, saying, Listen to my voice,
        and I will be your God, and you shall be my people;
        and walk you in all the way that I command you, that it may
        be well with you.
007:024 But they didn't listen nor turn their ear, but walked in [their
        own] counsels [and] in the stubbornness of their evil heart,
        and went backward, and not forward.
007:025 Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt
        to this day, I have sent to you all my servants the prophets,
        daily rising up early and sending them:
007:026 yet they didn't listen to me, nor inclined their ear, but made
        their neck stiff:  they did worse than their fathers.
007:027 You shall speak all these words to them; but they will not
        listen to you:  you shall also call to them; but they will
        not answer you.
007:028 You shall tell them, This is the nation that has not listened
        to the voice of Yahweh their God, nor received instruction:
        truth is perished, and is cut off from their mouth.
007:029 Cut off your hair, [Jerusalem], and cast it away, and take up
        a lamentation on the bare heights; for Yahweh has rejected
        and forsaken the generation of his wrath.
007:030 For the children of Judah have done that which is evil in my sight,
        says Yahweh:  they have set their abominations in the house
        which is called by my name, to defile it.
007:031 They have built the high places of Topheth, which is
        in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons
        and their daughters in the fire; which I didn't command,
        nor did it come into my mind.
007:032 Therefore, behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that it shall
        no more be called Topheth, nor The valley of the son of Hinnom,
        but The valley of Slaughter:  for they shall bury in Topheth,
        until there be no place [to bury].
007:033 The dead bodies of this people shall be food for the birds
        of the sky, and for the animals of the earth; and none shall
        frighten them away.
007:034 Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from
        the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth and the voice
        of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride;
        for the land shall become a waste.
008:001 At that time, says Yahweh, they shall bring out the bones
        of the kings of Judah, and the bones of his princes,
        and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets,
        and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves;
008:002 and they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon,
        and all the army of the sky, which they have loved,
        and which they have served, and after which they have walked,
        and which they have sought, and which they have worshiped:
        they shall not be gathered, nor be buried, they shall be
        for dung on the surface of the earth.
008:003 Death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue
        that remain of this evil family, that remain in all the places
        where I have driven them, says Yahweh of Armies.
008:004 Moreover you shall tell them, Thus says Yahweh:  Shall men fall,
        and not rise up again?  Shall one turn away, and not return?
008:005 Why then is this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual
        backsliding? they hold fast deceit, they refuse to return.
008:006 I listened and heard, but they didn't speak aright:
        no man repents him of his wickedness, saying, What have I
        done? everyone turns to his course, as a horse that rushes
        headlong in the battle.
008:007 Yes, the stork in the sky knows her appointed times;
        and the turtledove and the swallow and the crane observe the time
        of their coming; but my people don't know Yahweh's law.
008:008 How do you say, We are wise, and the law of Yahweh is with us?
        But, behold, the false pen of the scribes has worked falsely.
008:009 The wise men are disappointed, they are dismayed and taken:
        behold, they have rejected the word of Yahweh; and what manner
        of wisdom is in them?
008:010 Therefore will I give their wives to others, and their
        fields to those who shall possess them:  for everyone from
        the least even to the greatest is given to covetousness;
        from the prophet even to the priest every one deals falsely.
008:011 They have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly,
        saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.
008:012 Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay,
        they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush:
        therefore shall they fall among those who fall; in the time
        of their visitation they shall be cast down, says Yahweh.
008:013 I will utterly consume them, says Yahweh:  there shall be no
        grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, and the leaf
        shall fade; and [the things that] I have given them shall
        pass away from them.
008:014 Why do we sit still?  Assemble yourselves, and let us enter
        into the fortified cities, and let us be silent there;
        for Yahweh our God has put us to silence, and given us water
        of gall to drink, because we have sinned against Yahweh.
008:015 We looked for peace, but no good came; [and] for a time of healing,
        and behold, dismay!
008:016 The snorting of his horses is heard from Dan:  at the sound
        of the neighing of his strong ones the whole land trembles;
        for they are come, and have devoured the land and all that is in it;
        the city and those who dwell therein.
008:017 For, behold, I will send serpents, adders, among you, which will
        not be charmed; and they shall bite you, says Yahweh.
008:018 Oh that I could comfort myself against sorrow!  My heart
        is faint within me.
008:019 Behold, the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people from a land
        that is very far off:  isn't Yahweh in Zion?  Isn't her King in her?
        Why have they provoked me to anger with their engraved images,
        and with foreign vanities?
008:020 The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.
008:021 For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt:
        I mourn; dismay has taken hold on me.
008:022 Is there no balm in Gilead? is there no physician there? why
        then isn't the health of the daughter of my people recovered?
009:001 Oh that my head were waters, and my eyes a spring of tears,
        that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter
        of my people!
009:002 Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men;
        that I might leave my people, and go from them! for they
        are all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men.
009:003 They bend their tongue, [as it were] their bow, for falsehood;
        and they are grown strong in the land, but not for truth:
        for they proceed from evil to evil, and they don't
        know me, says Yahweh.
009:004 Take you heed everyone of his neighbor, and don't you trust
        in any brother; for every brother will utterly supplant,
        and every neighbor will go about with slanders.
009:005 They will deceive everyone his neighbor, and will not speak
        the truth:  they have taught their tongue to speak lies;
        they weary themselves to commit iniquity.
009:006 Your habitation is in the midst of deceit; through deceit they
        refuse to know me, says Yahweh.
009:007 Therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies, Behold, I will melt them,
        and try them; for how [else] should I do, because of the daughter
        of my people?
009:008 Their tongue is a deadly arrow; it speaks deceit:
        one speaks peaceably to his neighbor with his mouth,
        but in his heart he lays wait for him.
009:009 Shall I not visit them for these things? says Yahweh;
        shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
009:010 For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing,
        and for the pastures of the wilderness a lamentation,
        because they are burned up, so that none passes through;
        neither can men hear the voice of the livestock; both the birds
        of the sky and the animals are fled, they are gone.
009:011 I will make Jerusalem heaps, a dwelling place of jackals; and I
        will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant.
009:012 Who is the wise man, that may understand this? and [who is]
        he to whom the mouth of Yahweh has spoken, that he may declare
        it? why is the land perished and burned up like a wilderness,
        so that none passes through?
009:013 Yahweh says, Because they have forsaken my law which I set
        before them, and have not obeyed my voice, neither walked therein,
009:014 but have walked after the stubbornness of their own heart,
        and after the Baals, which their fathers taught them;
009:015 therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, Behold, I
        will feed them, even this people, with wormwood, and give
        them water of gall to drink.
009:016 I will scatter them also among the nations, whom neither they nor
        their fathers have known; and I will send the sword after them,
        until I have consumed them.
009:017 Thus says Yahweh of Armies, Consider you, and call for the mourning
        women, that they may come; and send for the skillful women,
        that they may come:
009:018 and let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us,
        that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush
        out with waters.
009:019 For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we ruined!
        we are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land,
        because they have cast down our dwellings.
009:020 Yet hear the word of Yahweh, you women, and let your ear receive
        the word of his mouth; and teach your daughters wailing,
        and everyone her neighbor lamentation.
009:021 For death is come up into our windows, it is entered into our palaces;
        to cut off the children from outside, [and] the young men
        from the streets.
009:022 Speak, Thus says Yahweh, The dead bodies of men shall fall as dung
        on the open field, and as the handful after the harvester;
        and none shall gather [them].
009:023 Thus says Yahweh, Don't let the wise man glory in his wisdom,
        neither let the mighty man glory in his might, don't let
        the rich man glory in his riches;
009:024 but let him who glories glory in this, that he has understanding,
        and knows me, that I am Yahweh who exercises loving
        kindness, justice, and righteousness, in the earth:
        for in these things I delight, says Yahweh.
009:025 Behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will punish all
        those who are circumcised in [their] uncircumcision:
009:026 Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab,
        and all that have the corners [of their hair] cut off, who dwell
        in the wilderness; for all the nations are uncircumcised,
        and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart.
010:001 Hear the word which Yahweh speaks to you, house of Israel!
010:002 Thus says Yahweh, "Don't learn the way of the nations,
        and don't be dismayed at the signs of the sky; for the nations
        are dismayed at them.
010:003 For the customs of the peoples are vanity; for one cuts a tree
        out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman
        with the axe.
010:004 They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails
        and with hammers, that it not move.
010:005 They are like a palm tree, of turned work, and don't speak:
        they must be carried, because they can't go.  Don't be afraid
        of them; for they can't do evil, neither is it in them
        to do good."
010:006 There is none like you, Yahweh; you are great, and your name
        is great in might.
010:007 Who should not fear you, King of the nations? for to you does
        it appertain; because among all the wise men of the nations,
        and in all their royal estate, there is none like you.
010:008 But they are together brutish and foolish:  the instruction
        of idols! it is but a stock.
010:009 There is silver beaten into plates, which is brought from Tarshish,
        and gold from Uphaz, the work of the artificer and of the hands
        of the goldsmith; blue and purple for their clothing;
        they are all the work of skillful men.
010:010 But Yahweh is the true God; he is the living God,
        and an everlasting King:  at his wrath the earth trembles,
        and the nations are not able to abide his indignation.
010:011 Thus shall you say to them, The gods that have not made
        the heavens and the earth, these shall perish from the earth,
        and from under the heavens.
010:012 He has made the earth by his power, he has established the world
        by his wisdom, and by his understanding has he stretched
        out the heavens:
010:013 when he utters his voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens,
        and he causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth;
        he makes lightnings for the rain, and brings forth the wind
        out of his treasuries.
010:014 Every man is become brutish [and is] without knowledge;
        every goldsmith is disappointed by his engraved image;
        for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.
010:015 They are vanity, a work of delusion:  in the time of their
        visitation they shall perish.
010:016 The portion of Jacob is not like these; for he is the former
        of all things; and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance:
        Yahweh of Armies is his name.
010:017 Gather up your wares out of the land, you who abide in the siege.
010:018 For thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants
        of the land at this time, and will distress them, that they
        may feel [it].
010:019 Woe is me because of my hurt! my wound is grievous:
        but I said, Truly this is [my] grief, and I must bear it.
010:020 My tent is destroyed, and all my cords are broken:
        my children are gone forth from me, and they are no more:
        there is none to spread my tent any more, and to set
        up my curtains.
010:021 For the shepherds are become brutish, and have not inquired
        of Yahweh:  therefore they have not prospered, and all their
        flocks are scattered.
010:022 The voice of news, behold, it comes, and a great commotion out
        of the north country, to make the cities of Judah a desolation,
        a dwelling place of jackals.
010:023 Yahweh, I know that the way of man is not in himself:
        it is not in man who walks to direct his steps.
010:024 Yahweh, correct me, but in measure:  not in your anger,
        lest you bring me to nothing.
010:025 Pour out your wrath on the nations that don't know you,
        and on the families that don't call on your name:
        for they have devoured Jacob, yes, they have devoured him
        and consumed him, and have laid waste his habitation.
011:001 The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,
011:002 Hear you the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Judah,
        and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem;
011:003 and say you to them, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel:  Cursed be
        the man who doesn't hear the words of this covenant,
011:004 which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them
        forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the iron furnace, saying,
        Obey my voice, and do them, according to all which I command you:
        so shall you be my people, and I will be your God;
011:005 that I may establish the oath which I swore to your fathers,
        to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as at this day.
        Then answered I, and said, Amen, Yahweh.
011:006 Yahweh said to me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah,
        and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear you the words
        of this covenant, and do them.
011:007 For I earnestly protested to your fathers in the day that I
        brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even to this day,
        rising early and protesting, saying, Obey my voice.
011:008 Yet they didn't obey, nor turn their ear, but walked
        everyone in the stubbornness of their evil heart:
        therefore I brought on them all the words of this covenant,
        which I commanded them to do, but they didn't do them.
011:009 Yahweh said to me, A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah,
        and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
011:010 They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers,
        who refused to hear my words; and they are gone after other gods
        to serve them:  the house of Israel and the house of Judah
        have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers.
011:011 Therefore thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will bring evil on them,
        which they shall not be able to escape; and they shall cry to me,
        but I will not listen to them.
011:012 Then shall the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem
        go and cry to the gods to which they offer incense:
        but they will not save them at all in the time of their trouble.
011:013 For according to the number of your cities are your gods, Judah;
        and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have
        you set up altars to the shameful thing, even altars to burn
        incense to Baal.
011:014 Therefore don't you pray for this people, neither lift up cry
        nor prayer for them; for I will not hear them in the time
        that they cry to me because of their trouble.
011:015 What has my beloved to do in my house, seeing she has worked
        lewdness [with] many, and the holy flesh is passed from you?
        when you do evil, then you rejoice.
011:016 Yahweh called your name, A green olive tree, beautiful with
        goodly fruit:  with the noise of a great tumult he has kindled
        fire on it, and the branches of it are broken.
011:017 For Yahweh of Armies, who planted you, has pronounced evil
        against you, because of the evil of the house of Israel and
        of the house of Judah, which they have worked for themselves
        in provoking me to anger by offering incense to Baal.
011:018 Yahweh gave me knowledge of it, and I knew it:  then you shown
        me their doings.
011:019 But I was like a gentle lamb that is led to the slaughter;
        and I didn't know that they had devised devices against me,
        [saying], Let us destroy the tree with the fruit of it,
        and let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his
        name may be no more remembered.
011:020 But, Yahweh of Armies, who judges righteously, who tests
        the heart and the mind, I shall see your vengeance on them;
        for to you have I revealed my cause.
011:021 Therefore thus says Yahweh concerning the men of Anathoth,
        who seek your life, saying, You shall not prophesy in the name
        of Yahweh, that you not die by our hand;
011:022 therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies, Behold, I will punish them:
        the young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their
        daughters shall die by famine;
011:023 and there shall be no remnant to them:  for I will bring evil
        on the men of Anathoth, even the year of their visitation.
012:001 Righteous are you, Yahweh, when I contend with you; yet would
        I reason the cause with you:  why does the way of the wicked
        prosper? why are all they at ease who deal very treacherously?
012:002 You have planted them, yes, they have taken root; they grow,
        yes, they bring forth fruit:  you are near in their mouth,
        and far from their heart.
012:003 But you, Yahweh, know me; you see me, and try my heart toward you:
        pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them
        for the day of slaughter.
012:004 How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of the whole
        country wither? for the wickedness of those who dwell therein,
        the animals are consumed, and the birds; because they said,
        He shall not see our latter end.
012:005 If you have run with the footmen, and they have wearied you,
        then how can you contend with horses? and though in a land
        of peace you are secure, yet how will you do in the pride
        of the Jordan?
012:006 For even your brothers, and the house of your father, even they
        have dealt treacherously with you; even they have cried aloud
        after you:  don't believe them, though they speak beautiful
        words to you.
012:007 I have forsaken my house, I have cast off my heritage;
        I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand
        of her enemies.
012:008 My heritage is become to me as a lion in the forest:
        she has uttered her voice against me; therefore I have hated her.
012:009 Is my heritage to me as a speckled bird of prey? are the birds
        of prey against her round about? go you, assemble all the animals
        of the field, bring them to devour.
012:010 Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden
        my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion
        a desolate wilderness.
012:011 They have made it a desolation; it mourns to me, being desolate;
        the whole land is made desolate, because no man lays it to heart.
012:012 Destroyers are come on all the bare heights in the wilderness;
        for the sword of Yahweh devours from the one end of the land
        even to the other end of the land:  no flesh has peace.
012:013 They have sown wheat, and have reaped thorns;
        they have put themselves to pain, and profit nothing:
        and you shall be ashamed of your fruits, because of the fierce
        anger of Yahweh.
012:014 Thus says Yahweh against all my evil neighbors, who touch
        the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit:
        behold, I will pluck them up from off their land, and will
        pluck up the house of Judah from among them.
012:015 It shall happen, after that I have plucked them up, I will return
        and have compassion on them; and I will bring them again,
        every man to his heritage, and every man to his land.
012:016 It shall happen, if they will diligently learn the ways
        of my people, to swear by my name, As Yahweh lives;
        even as they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall
        they be built up in the midst of my people.
012:017 But if they will not hear, then will I pluck up that nation,
        plucking up and destroying it, says Yahweh.
013:001 Thus says Yahweh to me, Go, and buy you a linen belt, and put
        it on your waist, and don't put it in water.
013:002 So I bought a belt according to the word of Yahweh, and put
        it on my waist.
013:003 The word of Yahweh came to me the second time, saying,
013:004 Take the belt that you have bought, which is on your waist,
        and arise, go to the Euphrates, and hide it there in a cleft
        of the rock.
013:005 So I went, and hid it by the Euphrates, as Yahweh commanded me.
013:006 It happened after many days, that Yahweh said to me, Arise,
        go to the Euphrates, and take the belt from there, which I
        commanded you to hide there.
013:007 Then I went to the Euphrates, and dug, and took the belt from
        the place where I had hid it; and behold, the belt was marred,
        it was profitable for nothing.
013:008 Then the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
013:009 Thus says Yahweh, After this manner will I mar the pride of Judah,
        and the great pride of Jerusalem.
013:010 This evil people, who refuse to hear my words, who walk in
        the stubbornness of their heart, and are gone after other gods
        to serve them, and to worship them, shall even be as this belt,
        which is profitable for nothing.
013:011 For as the belt cleaves to the waist of a man, so have I caused
        to cleave to me the whole house of Israel and the whole house
        of Judah, says Yahweh; that they may be to me for a people,
        and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory:
        but they would not hear.
013:012 Therefore you shall speak to them this word:  Thus says Yahweh,
        the God of Israel, Every bottle shall be filled with wine:
        and they shall tell you, Do we not certainly know that every
        bottle shall be filled with wine?
013:013 Then shall you tell them, Thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will fill
        all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings who sit
        on David's throne, and the priests, and the prophets,
        and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness.
013:014 I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and
        the sons together, says Yahweh:  I will not pity, nor spare,
        nor have compassion, that I should not destroy them.
013:015 Hear you, and give ear; don't be proud; for Yahweh has spoken.
013:016 Give glory to Yahweh your God, before he cause darkness,
        and before your feet stumble on the dark mountains, and,
        while you look for light, he turn it into the shadow of death,
        and make it gross darkness.
013:017 But if you will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret
        for [your] pride; and my eye shall weep sore, and run down
        with tears, because Yahweh's flock is taken captive.
013:018 Say you to the king and to the queen mother, Humble yourselves,
        sit down; for your headdresses are come down, even the crown
        of your glory.
013:019 The cities of the South are shut up, and there is none to open them:
        Judah is carried away captive, all of it; it is wholly
        carried away captive.
013:020 Lift up your eyes, and see those who come from the north:
        where is the flock that was given you, your beautiful flock?
013:021 What will you say, when he shall set over you as head those
        whom you have yourself taught to be friends to you? shall
        not sorrows take hold of you, as of a woman in travail?
013:022 If you say in your heart, Why are these things come on me?
        for the greatness of your iniquity are your skirts uncovered,
        and your heels suffer violence.
013:023 Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots?
        then may you also do good, who are accustomed to do evil.
013:024 Therefore will I scatter them, as the stubble that passes away,
        by the wind of the wilderness.
013:025 This is your lot, the portion measured to you from me, says Yahweh;
        because you have forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood.
013:026 Therefore will I also uncover your skirts on your face,
        and your shame shall appear.
013:027 I have seen your abominations, even your adulteries,
        and your neighing, the lewdness of your prostitution,
        on the hills in the field.  Woe to you, Jerusalem! you will
        not be made clean; how long shall it yet be?
014:001 The word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah concerning the drought.
014:002 Judah mourns, and the gates of it languish, they sit in black
        on the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up.
014:003 Their nobles send their little ones to the waters:
        they come to the cisterns, and find no water; they return
        with their vessels empty; they are disappointed and confounded,
        and cover their heads.
014:004 Because of the ground which is cracked, because no rain
        has been in the land, the plowmen are disappointed,
        they cover their heads.
014:005 Yes, the hind also in the field calves, and forsakes [her young],
        because there is no grass.
014:006 The wild donkeys stand on the bare heights, they pant for air
        like jackals; their eyes fail, because there is no herbage.
014:007 Though our iniquities testify against us, work you for
        your name's sake, Yahweh; for our backslidings are many;
        we have sinned against you.
014:008 You hope of Israel, the Savior of it in the time of trouble,
        why should you be as a foreigner in the land, and as a wayfaring
        man who turns aside to stay for a night?
014:009 Why should you be like a scared man, as a mighty man who can't
        save? yet you, Yahweh, are in the midst of us, and we are
        called by your name; don't leave us.
014:010 Thus says Yahweh to this people, Even so have they loved to wander;
        they have not refrained their feet:  therefore Yahweh does
        not accept them; now he will remember their iniquity,
        and visit their sins.
014:011 Yahweh said to me, Don't pray for this people for [their] good.
014:012 When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer
        burnt offering and meal offering, I will not accept them;
        but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine,
        and by the pestilence.
014:013 Then said I, Ah, Lord Yahweh! behold, the prophets tell them,
        You shall not see the sword, neither shall you have famine;
        but I will give you assured peace in this place.
014:014 Then Yahweh said to me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name;
        I didn't send them, neither have I commanded them, neither spoke
        I to them:  they prophesy to you a lying vision, and divination,
        and a thing of nothing, and the deceit of their own heart.
014:015 Therefore thus says Yahweh concerning the prophets
        who prophesy in my name, and I didn't send them,
        yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land:
        By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed.
014:016 The people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the
        streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword;
        and they shall have none to bury them--them, their wives,
        nor their sons, nor their daughters:  for I will pour their
        wickedness on them.
014:017 You shall say this word to them, Let my eyes run down with
        tears night and day, and let them not cease; for the virgin
        daughter of my people is broken with a great breach,
        with a very grievous wound.
014:018 If I go forth into the field, then, behold, the slain with
        the sword! and if I enter into the city, then, behold, those who
        are sick with famine! for both the prophet and the priest go
        about in the land, and have no knowledge.
014:019 Have you utterly rejected Judah? has your soul loathed Zion?
        why have you struck us, and there is no healing for us?
        We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of healing,
        and behold, dismay!
014:020 We acknowledge, Yahweh, our wickedness, and the iniquity
        of our fathers; for we have sinned against you.
014:021 Do not abhor [us], for your name's sake; do not disgrace the throne
        of your glory:  remember, don't break your covenant with us.
014:022 Are there any among the vanities of the nations that can
        cause rain? or can the sky give showers?  Aren't you he,
        Yahweh our God? therefore we will wait for you; for you
        have made all these things.
015:001 Then said Yahweh to me, Though Moses and Samuel stood
        before me, yet my mind would not be toward this people:
        cast them out of my sight, and let them go forth.
015:002 It shall happen, when they tell you, Where shall we go
        forth? then you shall tell them, Thus says Yahweh:  Such as
        are for death, to death; and such as are for the sword,
        to the sword; and such as are for the famine, to the famine;
        and such as are for captivity, to captivity.
015:003 I will appoint over them four kinds, says Yahweh:
        the sword to kill, and the dogs to tear, and the birds of the sky,
        and the animals of the earth, to devour and to destroy.
015:004 I will cause them to be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms
        of the earth, because of Manasseh, the son of Hezekiah,
        king of Judah, for that which he did in Jerusalem.
015:005 For who will have pity on you, Jerusalem? or who will bemoan
        you? or who will turn aside to ask of your welfare?
015:006 You have rejected me, says Yahweh, you are gone backward:
        therefore have I stretched out my hand against you,
        and destroyed you; I am weary with repenting.
015:007 I have winnowed them with a fan in the gates of the land;
        I have bereaved [them] of children, I have destroyed my people;
        they didn't return from their ways.
015:008 Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas;
        I have brought on them against the mother of the young men
        a destroyer at noonday:  I have caused anguish and terrors
        to fall on her suddenly.
015:009 She who has borne seven languishes; she has given up the spirit;
        her sun is gone down while it was yet day; she has been
        disappointed and confounded:  and the residue of them will I
        deliver to the sword before their enemies, says Yahweh.
015:010 Woe is me, my mother, that you have borne me a man
        of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth!
        I have not lent, neither have men lent to me; [yet] everyone
        of them does curse me.
015:011 Yahweh said, Most certainly I will strengthen you for good;
        most certainly I will cause the enemy to make supplication
        to you in the time of evil and in the time of affliction.
015:012 Can one break iron, even iron from the north, and brass?
015:013 Your substance and your treasures will I give for a spoil
        without price, and that for all your sins, even in all your borders.
015:014 I will make [them] to pass with your enemies into a land
        which you don't know; for a fire is kindled in my anger,
        which shall burn on you.
015:015 Yahweh, you know; remember me, and visit me, and avenge me
        of my persecutors; don't take me away in your longsuffering:
        know that for your sake I have suffered reproach.
015:016 Your words were found, and I ate them; and your words were
        to me a joy and the rejoicing of my heart:  for I am called
        by your name, Yahweh, God of Armies.
015:017 I didn't sit in the assembly of those who make merry, nor rejoiced;
        I sat alone because of your hand; for you have filled
        me with indignation.
015:018 Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, which refuses
        to be healed? will you indeed be to me as a deceitful [brook],
        as waters that fail?
015:019 Therefore thus says Yahweh, If you return, then will I bring
        you again, that you may stand before me; and if you take
        forth the precious from the vile, you shall be as my mouth:
        they shall return to you, but you shall not return to them.
015:020 I will make you to this people a fortified bronze wall; and they
        shall fight against you, but they shall not prevail against you;
        for I am with you to save you and to deliver you, says Yahweh.
015:021 I will deliver you out of the hand of the wicked, and I will
        redeem you out of the hand of the terrible.
016:001 The word of Yahweh came also to me, saying,
016:002 You shall not take a wife, neither shall you have sons or daughters,
        in this place.
016:003 For thus says Yahweh concerning the sons and concerning
        the daughters who are born in this place, and concerning
        their mothers who bore them, and concerning their fathers
        who became the father of them in this land:
016:004 They shall die grievous deaths:  they shall not be lamented,
        neither shall they be buried; they shall be as dung on the surface
        of the ground; and they shall be consumed by the sword,
        and by famine; and their dead bodies shall be food for the birds
        of the sky, and for the animals of the earth.
016:005 For thus says Yahweh, Don't enter into the house of mourning,
        neither go to lament, neither bemoan them; for I have taken
        away my peace from this people, says Yahweh, even loving
        kindness and tender mercies.
016:006 Both great and small shall die in this land; they shall not
        be buried, neither shall men lament for them, nor cut themselves,
        nor make themselves bald for them;
016:007 neither shall men break [bread] for them in mourning,
        to comfort them for the dead; neither shall men give them the cup
        of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother.
016:008 You shall not go into the house of feasting to sit with them,
        to eat and to drink.
016:009 For thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel:  Behold, I will
        cause to cease out of this place, before your eyes and in
        your days, the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness,
        the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride.
016:010 It shall happen, when you shall show this people all these words,
        and they shall tell you, Why has Yahweh pronounced all this
        great evil against us? or what is our iniquity? or what is
        our sin that we have committed against Yahweh our God?
016:011 Then shall you tell them, Because your fathers have forsaken me,
        says Yahweh, and have walked after other gods, and have
        served them, and have worshiped them, and have forsaken me,
        and have not kept my law;
016:012 and you have done evil more than your fathers; for, behold,
        you walk every one after the stubbornness of his evil heart,
        so that you don't listen to me:
016:013 therefore will I cast you forth out of this land into the land
        that you have not known, neither you nor your fathers;
        and there shall you serve other gods day and night;
        for I will show you no favor.
016:014 Therefore, behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that it shall
        no more be said, As Yahweh lives, who brought up the children
        of Israel out of the land of Egypt;
016:015 but, As Yahweh lives, who brought up the children of Israel
        from the land of the north, and from all the countries where
        he had driven them.  I will bring them again into their land
        that I gave to their fathers.
016:016 Behold, I will send for many fishermen, says Yahweh, and they
        shall fish them up; and afterward I will send for many hunters,
        and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill,
        and out of the clefts of the rocks.
016:017 For my eyes are on all their ways; they are not hidden from
        my face, neither is their iniquity concealed from my eyes.
016:018 First I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double,
        because they have polluted my land with the carcasses
        of their detestable things, and have filled my inheritance
        with their abominations.
016:019 Yahweh, my strength, and my stronghold, and my refuge in the day
        of affliction, to you shall the nations come from the ends
        of the earth, and shall say, Our fathers have inherited
        nothing but lies, [even] vanity and things in which there
        is no profit.
016:020 Shall a man make to himself gods, which yet are no gods?
016:021 Therefore, behold, I will cause them to know, this once will I
        cause them to know my hand and my might; and they shall know
        that my name is Yahweh.
017:001 The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron, [and] with the point
        of a diamond:  it is engraved on the tablet of their heart,
        and on the horns of your altars;
017:002 while their children remember their altars and their Asherim
        by the green trees on the high hills.
017:003 My mountain in the field, I will give your substance and all your
        treasures for a spoil, [and] your high places, because of sin,
        throughout all your borders.
017:004 You, even of yourself, shall discontinue from your heritage
        that I gave you; and I will cause you to serve your enemies
        in the land which you don't know:  for you have kindled a fire
        in my anger which shall burn forever.
017:005 Thus says Yahweh:  Cursed is the man who trusts in man,
        and makes flesh his arm, and whose heart departs from Yahweh.
017:006 For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not
        see when good comes, but shall inhabit the parched places
        in the wilderness, a salt land and not inhabited.
017:007 Blessed is the man who trusts in Yahweh, and whose trust Yahweh is.
017:008 For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, who spreads
        out its roots by the river, and shall not fear when heat comes,
        but its leaf shall be green; and shall not be careful in the year
        of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit.
017:009 The heart is deceitful above all things, and it is
        exceedingly corrupt:  who can know it?
017:010 I, Yahweh, search the mind, I try the heart, even to give
        every man according to his ways, according to the fruit
        of his doings.
017:011 As the partridge that sits on [eggs] which she has not laid,
        so is he who gets riches, and not by right; in the midst
        of his days they shall leave him, and at his end he shall
        be a fool.
017:012 A glorious throne, [set] on high from the beginning,
        is the place of our sanctuary.
017:013 Yahweh, the hope of Israel, all who forsake you shall
        be disappointed.  Those who depart from me shall be written
        in the earth, because they have forsaken Yahweh, the spring
        of living waters.
017:014 Heal me, O Yahweh, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall
        be saved:  for you are my praise.
017:015 Behold, they tell me, Where is the word of Yahweh? let
        it come now.
017:016 As for me, I have not hurried from being a shepherd after you;
        neither have I desired the woeful day; you know:
        that which came out of my lips was before your face.
017:017 Don't be a terror to me:  you are my refuge in the day of evil.
017:018 Let them be disappointed who persecute me, but let not me
        be disappointed; let them be dismayed, but don't let me
        be dismayed; bring on them the day of evil, and destroy them
        with double destruction.
017:019 Thus said Yahweh to me:  Go, and stand in the gate of the children
        of the people, through which the kings of Judah come in,
        and by which they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem;
017:020 and tell them, Hear you the word of Yahweh, you kings of Judah,
        and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
        that enter in by these gates:
017:021 Thus says Yahweh, Take heed to yourselves, and bear no burden
        on the Sabbath day, nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem;
017:022 neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the Sabbath
        day holy, neither do any work:  but make the Sabbath day,
        as I commanded your fathers.
017:023 But they didn't listen, neither turn their ear, but made
        their neck stiff, that they might not hear, and might
        not receive instruction.
017:024 It shall happen, if you diligently listen to me, says Yahweh,
        to bring in no burden through the gates of this city
        on the Sabbath day, but to make the Sabbath day holy,
        to do no work therein;
017:025 then shall there enter in by the gates of this city
        kings and princes sitting on the throne of David,
        riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their princes,
        the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem;
        and this city shall remain forever.
017:026 They shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the places
        round about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from
        the lowland, and from the hill country, and from the South,
        bringing burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and meal offerings,
        and frankincense, and bringing [sacrifices of] thanksgiving,
        to the house of Yahweh.
017:027 But if you will not listen to me to make the Sabbath day holy,
        and not to bear a burden and enter in at the gates of Jerusalem
        on the Sabbath day; then will I kindle a fire in the gates of it,
        and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall
        not be quenched.
018:001 The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,
018:002 Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there I will cause
        you to hear my words.
018:003 Then I went down to the potter's house, and behold, he was
        making a work on the wheels.
018:004 When the vessel that he made of the clay was marred in the hand
        of the potter, he made it again another vessel, as seemed
        good to the potter to make it.
018:005 Then the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
018:006 House of Israel, can't I do with you as this potter? says Yahweh.
        Behold, as the clay in the potter's hand, so are you in my hand,
        house of Israel.
018:007 At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning
        a kingdom, to pluck up and to break down and to destroy it;
018:008 if that nation, concerning which I have spoken, turn from their evil,
        I will repent of the evil that I thought to do to them.
018:009 At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning
        a kingdom, to build and to plant it;
018:010 if they do that which is evil in my sight, that they not obey
        my voice, then I will repent of the good, with which I said
        I would benefit them.
018:011 Now therefore, speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants
        of Jerusalem, saying, Thus says Yahweh:  Behold, I frame
        evil against you, and devise a device against you:
        return you now everyone from his evil way, and amend your ways
        and your doings.
018:012 But they say, It is in vain; for we will walk after our
        own devices, and we will do everyone after the stubbornness
        of his evil heart.
018:013 Therefore thus says Yahweh:  Ask you now among the nations,
        who has heard such things; the virgin of Israel has done
        a very horrible thing.
018:014 Shall the snow of Lebanon fail from the rock of the field? [or]
        shall the cold waters that flow down from afar be dried up?
018:015 For my people have forgotten me, they have burned incense to
        false [gods]; and they have been made to stumble in their ways,
        in the ancient paths, to walk in byways, in a way not built up;
018:016 to make their land an astonishment, and a perpetual hissing;
        everyone who passes thereby shall be astonished,
        and shake his head.
018:017 I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy;
        I will show them the back, and not the face, in the day
        of their calamity.
018:018 Then said they, Come, and let us devise devices against Jeremiah;
        for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel
        from the wise, nor the word from the prophet.  Come, and let
        us strike him with the tongue, and let us not give heed
        to any of his words.
018:019 Give heed to me, Yahweh, and listen to the voice of those who
        contend with me.
018:020 Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have dug a pit
        for my soul.  Remember how I stood before you to speak good
        for them, to turn away your wrath from them.
018:021 Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, and give
        them over to the power of the sword; and let their wives
        become childless, and widows; and let their men be slain of death,
        [and] their young men struck of the sword in battle.
018:022 Let a cry be heard from their houses, when you shall bring
        a troop suddenly on them; for they have dug a pit to take me,
        and hid snares for my feet.
018:023 Yet, Yahweh, you know all their counsel against me to kill me;
        don't forgive their iniquity, neither blot out their sin
        from your sight; but let them be overthrown before you;
        deal you with them in the time of your anger.
019:001 Thus said Yahweh, Go, and buy a potter's earthen bottle,
        and [take] of the elders of the people, and of the elders
        of the priests;
019:002 and go forth to the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is by
        the entry of the gate Harsith, and proclaim there the words
        that I shall tell you;
019:003 and say, Hear you the word of Yahweh, kings of Judah,
        and inhabitants of Jerusalem:  thus says Yahweh of Armies,
        the God of Israel, Behold, I will bring evil on this place,
        which whoever hears, his ears shall tingle.
019:004 Because they have forsaken me, and have estranged this place,
        and have burned incense in it to other gods, that they
        didn't know, they and their fathers and the kings of Judah;
        and have filled this place with the blood of innocents,
019:005 and have built the high places of Baal, to burn their sons
        in the fire for burnt offerings to Baal; which I didn't command,
        nor spoke it, neither came it into my mind:
019:006 therefore, behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that this place
        shall no more be called Topheth, nor The valley of the son
        of Hinnom, but The valley of Slaughter.
019:007 I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place;
        and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies,
        and by the hand of those who seek their life:  and their dead
        bodies will I give to be food for the birds of the sky,
        and for the animals of the earth.
019:008 I will make this city an astonishment, and a hissing;
        everyone who passes thereby shall be astonished and hiss
        because of all the plagues of it.
019:009 I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and
        the flesh of their daughters; and they shall eat everyone
        the flesh of his friend, in the siege and in the distress,
        with which their enemies, and those who seek their life,
        shall distress them.
019:010 Then shall you break the bottle in the sight of the men
        who go with you,
019:011 and shall tell them, Thus says Yahweh of Armies:  Even so will I
        break this people and this city, as one breaks a potter's vessel,
        that can't be made whole again; and they shall bury in Topheth,
        until there be no place to bury.
019:012 Thus will I do to this place, says Yahweh, and to the inhabitants
        of it, even making this city as Topheth:
019:013 and the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings
        of Judah, which are defiled, shall be as the place of Topheth,
        even all the houses on whose roofs they have burned incense
        to all the army of the sky, and have poured out drink offerings
        to other gods.
019:014 Then came Jeremiah from Topheth, where Yahweh had sent him
        to prophesy; and he stood in the court of Yahweh's house,
        and said to all the people:
019:015 Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, Behold, I will
        bring on this city and on all its towns all the evil that I have
        pronounced against it; because they have made their neck stiff,
        that they may not hear my words.
020:001 Now Pashhur, the son of Immer the priest, who was chief officer
        in the house of Yahweh, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things.
020:002 Then Pashhur struck Jeremiah the prophet, and put him
        in the stocks that were in the upper gate of Benjamin,
        which was in the house of Yahweh.
020:003 It happened on the next day, that Pashhur brought forth
        Jeremiah out of the stocks.  Then said Jeremiah to him,
        Yahweh has not called your name Pashhur, but Magormissabib.
020:004 For thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will make you a terror
        to yourself, and to all your friends; and they shall fall
        by the sword of their enemies, and your eyes shall see it;
        and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon,
        and he shall carry them captive to Babylon, and shall kill
        them with the sword.
020:005 Moreover I will give all the riches of this city, and all the gains
        of it, and all the precious things of it, yes, all the treasures
        of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies;
        and they shall make them a prey, and take them, and carry
        them to Babylon.
020:006 You, Pashhur, and all who dwell in your house shall go into captivity;
        and you shall come to Babylon, and there you shall die,
        and there shall you be buried, you, and all your friends,
        to whom you have prophesied falsely.
020:007 Yahweh, you have persuaded me, and I was persuaded;
        you are stronger than I, and have prevailed:  I am become
        a laughing-stock all the day, every one mocks me.
020:008 For as often as I speak, I cry out; I cry, Violence and
        destruction! because the word of Yahweh is made a reproach to me,
        and a derision, all the day.
020:009 If I say, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more
        in his name, then there is in my heart as it were a burning
        fire shut up in my bones, and I am weary with forbearing,
        and I can't [contain].
020:010 For I have heard the defaming of many, terror on every side.
        Denounce, and we will denounce him, [say] all my familiar friends,
        those who watch for my fall; peradventure he will be persuaded,
        and we shall prevail against him, and we shall take our
        revenge on him.
020:011 But Yahweh is with me as an awesome mighty one:  therefore my
        persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail;
        they shall be utterly disappointed, because they have not
        dealt wisely, even with an everlasting dishonor which shall
        never be forgotten.
020:012 But, Yahweh of Armies, who tests the righteous, who sees
        the heart and the mind, let me see your vengeance on them;
        for to you have I revealed my cause.
020:013 Sing to Yahweh, praise you Yahweh; for he has delivered the soul
        of the needy from the hand of evil-doers.
020:014 Cursed be the day in which I was born:  don't let the day
        in which my mother bore me be blessed.
020:015 Cursed be the man who brought news to my father, saying, A boy
        is born to you; making him very glad.
020:016 Let that man be as the cities which Yahweh overthrew,
        and didn't repent:  and let him hear a cry in the morning,
        and shouting at noontime;
020:017 because he didn't kill me from the womb; and so my mother
        would have been my grave, and her womb always great.
020:018 Why came I forth out of the womb to see labor and sorrow,
        that my days should be consumed with shame?
021:001 The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, when king Zedekiah
        sent to him Pashhur the son of Malchijah, and Zephaniah
        the son of Maaseiah, the priest, saying,
021:002 Please inquire of Yahweh for us; for Nebuchadnezzar king
        of Babylon makes war against us:  peradventure Yahweh
        will deal with us according to all his wondrous works,
        that he may go up from us.
021:003 Then said Jeremiah to them, Thus shall you tell Zedekiah:
021:004 Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, Behold, I will turn back
        the weapons of war that are in your hands, with which you
        fight against the king of Babylon, and against the Chaldeans
        who besiege you, without the walls; and I will gather them
        into the midst of this city.
021:005 I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand
        and with a strong arm, even in anger, and in wrath,
        and in great indignation.
021:006 I will strike the inhabitants of this city, both man and animal:
        they shall die of a great pestilence.
021:007 Afterward, says Yahweh, I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah,
        and his servants, and the people, even such as are left in this
        city from the pestilence, from the sword, and from the famine,
        into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand
        of their enemies, and into the hand of those who seek their life:
        and he shall strike them with the edge of the sword;
        he shall not spare them, neither have pity, nor have mercy.
021:008 To this people you shall say, Thus says Yahweh:  Behold, I set
        before you the way of life and the way of death.
021:009 He who remains in this city shall die by the sword,
        and by the famine, and by the pestilence; but he who goes out,
        and passes over to the Chaldeans who besiege you, he shall live,
        and his life shall be to him for a prey.
021:010 For I have set my face on this city for evil, and not for good,
        says Yahweh:  it shall be given into the hand of the king
        of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.
021:011 Touching the house of the king of Judah, hear you the word of Yahweh:
021:012 House of David, thus says Yahweh, Execute justice in the morning,
        and deliver him who is robbed out of the hand of the oppressor,
        lest my wrath go forth like fire, and burn so that none can
        quench it, because of the evil of your doings.
021:013 Behold, I am against you, O inhabitant of the valley,
        [and] of the rock of the plain, says Yahweh; you that say,
        Who shall come down against us? or who shall enter
        into our habitations?
021:014 I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings,
        says Yahweh; and I will kindle a fire in her forest, and it
        shall devour all that is round about her.
022:001 Thus said Yahweh:  Go down to the house of the king of Judah,
        and speak there this word,
022:002 Say, Hear the word of Yahweh, king of Judah, who sits on
        the throne of David, you, and your servants, and your people
        who enter in by these gates.
022:003 Thus says Yahweh:  Execute you justice and righteousness,
        and deliver him who is robbed out of the hand of the oppressor:
        and do no wrong, do no violence, to the foreigner, the fatherless,
        nor the widow; neither shed innocent blood in this place.
022:004 For if you do this thing indeed, then shall there enter in by
        the gates of this house kings sitting on the throne of David,
        riding in chariots and on horses, he, and his servants,
        and his people.
022:005 But if you will not hear these words, I swear by myself,
        says Yahweh, that this house shall become a desolation.
022:006 For thus says Yahweh concerning the house of the king
        of Judah:  You are Gilead to me, [and] the head of Lebanon;
        [yet] surely I will make you a wilderness, [and] cities
        which are not inhabited.
022:007 I will prepare destroyers against you, everyone with his weapons;
        and they shall cut down your choice cedars, and cast them
        into the fire.
022:008 Many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say every man
        to his neighbor, Why has Yahweh done thus to this great city?
022:009 Then they shall answer, Because they forsook the covenant
        of Yahweh their God, and worshiped other gods, and served them.
022:010 Don't you weep for the dead, neither bemoan him; but weep
        sore for him who goes away; for he shall return no more,
        nor see his native country.
022:011 For thus says Yahweh touching Shallum the son of Josiah,
        king of Judah, who reigned instead of Josiah his father,
        [and] who went forth out of this place:  He shall not return
        there any more.
022:012 But in the place where they have led him captive, there shall
        he die, and he shall see this land no more.
022:013 Woe to him who builds his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers
        by injustice; who uses his neighbor's service without wages,
        and doesn't give him his hire;
022:014 who says, I will build me a wide house and spacious chambers,
        and cuts him out windows; and it is ceiling with cedar,
        and painted with vermilion.
022:015 Shall you reign, because you strive to excel in cedar?
        Didn't your father eat and drink, and do justice and righteousness?
        then it was well with him.
022:016 He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well.
        Wasn't this to know me? says Yahweh.
022:017 But your eyes and your heart are not but for your covetousness,
        and for shedding innocent blood, and for oppression,
        and for violence, to do it.
022:018 Therefore thus says Yahweh concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah,
        king of Judah:  they shall not lament for him, [saying], Ah my
        brother! or, Ah sister!  They shall not lament for him,
        [saying] Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!
022:019 He shall be buried with the burial of a donkey, drawn and cast
        forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.
022:020 Go up to Lebanon, and cry; and lift up your voice in Bashan,
        and cry from Abarim; for all your lovers are destroyed.
022:021 I spoke to you in your prosperity; but you said, I will not hear.
        This has been your manner from your youth, that you didn't
        obey my voice.
022:022 The wind shall feed all your shepherds, and your lovers
        shall go into captivity:  surely then shall you be ashamed
        and confounded for all your wickedness.
022:023 Inhabitant of Lebanon, who makes your nest in the cedars,
        how greatly to be pitied shall you be when pangs come on you,
        the pain as of a woman in travail!
022:024 As I live, says Yahweh, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim
        king of Judah were the signet on my right hand, yet would I
        pluck you there;
022:025 and I will give you into the hand of those who seek your life,
        and into the hand of them of whom you are afraid, even into
        the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand
        of the Chaldeans.
022:026 I will cast you out, and your mother who bore you,
        into another country, where you were not born; and there
        shall you die.
022:027 But to the land whereunto their soul longs to return,
        there shall they not return.
022:028 Is this man Coniah a despised broken vessel? is he a vessel
        in which none delights? why are they cast out, he and his seed,
        and are cast into the land which they don't know?
022:029 O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of Yahweh.
022:030 Thus says Yahweh, Write you this man childless, a man
        who shall not prosper in his days; for no more shall a man
        of his seed prosper, sitting on the throne of David,
        and ruling in Judah.
023:001 Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my
        pasture! says Yahweh.
023:002 Therefore thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, against the
        shepherds who feed my people:  You have scattered my flock,
        and driven them away, and have not visited them; behold, I will
        visit on you the evil of your doings, says Yahweh.
023:003 I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries
        where I have driven them, and will bring them again to their folds;
        and they shall be fruitful and multiply.
023:004 I will set up shepherds over them, who shall feed them;
        and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall
        any be lacking, says Yahweh.
023:005 Behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will raise to David
        a righteous Branch, and he shall reign as king and deal wisely,
        and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.
023:006 In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely;
        and this is his name by which he shall be called:
        Yahweh our righteousness.
023:007 Therefore, behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that they shall
        no more say, As Yahweh lives, who brought up the children
        of Israel out of the land of Egypt;
023:008 but, As Yahweh lives, who brought up and who led the seed
        of the house of Israel out of the north country,
        and from all the countries where I had driven them.
        They shall dwell in their own land.
023:009 Concerning the prophets.  My heart within me is broken,
        all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man
        whom wine has overcome, because of Yahweh, and because of
        his holy words.
023:010 For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing
        the land mourns; the pastures of the wilderness are dried up.
        Their course is evil, and their might is not right;
023:011 for both prophet and priest are profane; yes, in my house
        have I found their wickedness, says Yahweh.
023:012 Therefore their way shall be to them as slippery places
        in the darkness:  they shall be driven on, and fall therein;
        for I will bring evil on them, even the year of their
        visitation, says Yahweh.
023:013 I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied
        by Baal, and caused my people Israel to err.
023:014 In the prophets of Jerusalem also I have seen a horrible thing:
        they commit adultery, and walk in lies; and they strengthen the hands
        of evil-doers, so that none does return from his wickedness:
        they are all of them become to me as Sodom, and the inhabitants
        of it as Gomorrah.
023:015 Therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies concerning the prophets:
        Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink
        the water of gall; for from the prophets of Jerusalem is
        ungodliness gone forth into all the land.
023:016 Thus says Yahweh of Armies, Don't listen to the words of
        the prophets who prophesy to you:  they teach you vanity;
        they speak a vision of their own heart, and not out of
        the mouth of Yahweh.
023:017 They say continually to those who despise me, Yahweh has said,
        You shall have peace; and to everyone who walks in the stubbornness
        of his own heart they say, No evil shall come on you.
023:018 For who has stood in the council of Yahweh, that he should
        perceive and hear his word? who has marked my word,
        and heard it?
023:019 Behold, the storm of Yahweh, [even his] wrath, is gone forth, yes,
        a whirling storm:  it shall burst on the head of the wicked.
023:020 The anger of Yahweh shall not return, until he has executed,
        and until he have performed the intents of his heart:
        in the latter days you shall understand it perfectly.
023:021 I sent not these prophets, yet they ran:  I didn't speak to them,
        yet they prophesied.
023:022 But if they had stood in my council, then had they caused my people
        to hear my words, and had turned them from their evil way,
        and from the evil of their doings.
023:023 Am I a God at hand, says Yahweh, and not a God afar off?
023:024 Can any hide himself in secret places so that I shall not see
        him? says Yahweh.  Don't I fill heaven and earth? says Yahweh.
023:025 I have heard what the prophets have said, who prophesy lies
        in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed.
023:026 How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets who prophesy lies,
        even the prophets of the deceit of their own heart?
023:027 who think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams
        which they tell every man to his neighbor, as their fathers
        forgot my name for Baal.
023:028 The prophet who has a dream, let him tell a dream;
        and he who has my word, let him speak my word faithfully.
        What is the straw to the wheat? says Yahweh.
023:029 Isn't my word like fire? says Yahweh; and like a hammer
        that breaks the rock in pieces?
023:030 Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, says Yahweh,
        who steal my words everyone from his neighbor.
023:031 Behold, I am against the prophets, says Yahweh, who use
        their tongues, and say, He says.
023:032 Behold, I am against those who prophesy lying dreams, says Yahweh,
        and do tell them, and cause my people to err by their lies,
        and by their vain boasting:  yet I didn't send them,
        nor commanded them; neither do they profit this people
        at all, says Yahweh.
023:033 When this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask you,
        saying, What is the burden of Yahweh? then shall you tell them,
        What burden!  I will cast you off, says Yahweh.
023:034 As for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, who shall say,
        The burden of Yahweh, I will even punish that man and his house.
023:035 Thus shall you say everyone to his neighbor, and everyone to
        his brother, What has Yahweh answered? and, What has Yahweh spoken?
023:036 The burden of Yahweh shall you mention no more:  for every
        man's own word shall be his burden; for you have perverted
        the words of the living God, of Yahweh of Armies our God.
023:037 Thus shall you say to the prophet, What has Yahweh answered
        you? and, What has Yahweh spoken?
023:038 But if you say, The burden of Yahweh; therefore thus
        says Yahweh:  Because you say this word, The burden of Yahweh,
        and I have sent to you, saying, You shall not say,
        The burden of Yahweh;
023:039 therefore, behold, I will utterly forget you, and I will cast
        you off, and the city that I gave to you and to your fathers,
        away from my presence:
023:040 and I will bring an everlasting reproach on you, and a
        perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.
024:001 Yahweh shown me, and behold, two baskets of figs set before
        the temple of Yahweh, after that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon
        had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim,
        king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the craftsmen
        and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon.
024:002 One basket had very good figs, like the figs that are first-ripe;
        and the other basket had very bad figs, which could not be eaten,
        they were so bad.
024:003 Then said Yahweh to me, What see you, Jeremiah?  I said, Figs;
        the good figs, very good; and the bad, very bad, that can't
        be eaten, they are so bad.
024:004 The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
024:005 Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel:  Like these good figs,
        so will I regard the captives of Judah, whom I have sent
        out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans, for good.
024:006 For I will set my eyes on them for good, and I will bring them again
        to this land:  and I will build them, and not pull them down;
        and I will plant them, and not pluck them up.
024:007 I will give them a heart to know me, that I am Yahweh:
        and they shall be my people, and I will be their God;
        for they shall return to me with their whole heart.
024:008 As the bad figs, which can't be eaten, they are so bad,
        surely thus says Yahweh, So will I give up Zedekiah the king
        of Judah, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem,
        who remain in this land, and those who dwell in the land of Egypt,
024:009 I will even give them up to be tossed back and forth among
        all the kingdoms of the earth for evil; to be a reproach
        and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places where I
        shall drive them.
024:010 I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence,
        among them, until they be consumed from off the land that I
        gave to them and to their fathers.
025:001 The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah,
        in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah
        (the same was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon),
025:002 which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah,
        and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying:
025:003 From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon,
        king of Judah, even to this day, these twenty-three years,
        the word of Yahweh has come to me, and I have spoken to you,
        rising up early and speaking; but you have not listened.
025:004 Yahweh has sent to you all his servants the prophets,
        rising up early and sending them, (but you have not listened,
        nor inclined your ear to hear),
025:005 saying, Return you now everyone from his evil way, and from the evil
        of your doings, and dwell in the land that Yahweh has given
        to you and to your fathers, from of old and even forevermore;
025:006 and don't go after other gods to serve them or worship them,
        and don't provoke me to anger with the work of your hands;
        and I will do you no harm.
025:007 Yet you have not listened to me, says Yahweh; that you may provoke
        me to anger with the work of your hands to your own hurt.
025:008 Therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies:  Because you have not
        heard my words,
025:009 behold, I will send and take all the families of the north,
        says Yahweh, and [I will send] to Nebuchadnezzar the king
        of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land,
        and against the inhabitants of it, and against all these nations
        round about; and I will utterly destroy them, and make them
        an astonishment, and a hissing, and perpetual desolations.
025:010 Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth and the voice
        of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice
        of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light
        of the lamp.
025:011 This whole land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment;
        and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.
025:012 It shall happen, when seventy years are accomplished,
        that I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation,
        says Yahweh, for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans;
        and I will make it desolate forever.
025:013 I will bring on that land all my words which I have pronounced
        against it, even all that is written in this book,
        which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations.
025:014 For many nations and great kings shall make bondservants of them,
        even of them; and I will recompense them according to their deeds,
        and according to the work of their hands.
025:015 For thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, to me:  take this cup
        of the wine of wrath at my hand, and cause all the nations,
        to whom I send you, to drink it.
025:016 They shall drink, and reel back and forth, and be mad,
        because of the sword that I will send among them.
025:017 Then took I the cup at Yahweh's hand, and made all the nations
        to drink, to whom Yahweh had sent me:
025:018 [to wit], Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and the kings
        of it, and the princes of it, to make them a desolation,
        an astonishment, a hissing, and a curse, as it is this day;
025:019 Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his servants, and his princes,
        and all his people;
025:020 and all the mixed people, and all the kings of the land of the Uz,
        and all the kings of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Gaza,
        and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod;
025:021 Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon;
025:022 and all the kings of Tyre, and all the kings of Sidon,
        and the kings of the isle which is beyond the sea;
025:023 Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all who have the corners [of
        their hair] cut off;
025:024 and all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mixed
        people who dwell in the wilderness;
025:025 and all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam,
        and all the kings of the Medes;
025:026 and all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another;
        and all the kingdoms of the world, which are on the surface
        of the earth:  and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them.
025:027 You shall tell them, Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God
        of Israel:  Drink you, and be drunken, and spew, and fall,
        and rise no more, because of the sword which I will
        send among you.
025:028 It shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at your hand
        to drink, then shall you tell them, Thus says Yahweh
        of Armies:  You shall surely drink.
025:029 For, behold, I begin to work evil at the city which is
        called by my name; and should you be utterly unpunished?
        You shall not be unpunished; for I will call for a sword
        on all the inhabitants of the earth, says Yahweh of Armies.
025:030 Therefore prophesy you against them all these words, and tell them,
        Yahweh will roar from on high, and utter his voice from his
        holy habitation; he will mightily roar against his fold;
        he will give a shout, as those who tread [the grapes],
        against all the inhabitants of the earth.
025:031 A noise shall come even to the end of the earth; for Yahweh
        has a controversy with the nations; he will enter into
        judgment with all flesh:  as for the wicked, he will give
        them to the sword, says Yahweh.
025:032 Thus says Yahweh of Armies, Behold, evil shall go forth
        from nation to nation, and a great storm shall be raised up
        from the uttermost parts of the earth.
025:033 The slain of Yahweh shall be at that day from one end
        of the earth even to the other end of the earth:
        they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried;
        they shall be dung on the surface of the ground.
025:034 Wail, you shepherds, and cry; and wallow [in ashes],
        you principal of the flock; for the days of your slaughter
        and of your dispersions are fully come, and you shall fall
        like a goodly vessel.
025:035 The shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal
        of the flock to escape.
025:036 A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and the wailing of the
        principal of the flock! for Yahweh lays waste their pasture.
025:037 The peaceable folds are brought to silence because of the fierce
        anger of Yahweh.
025:038 He has left his covert, as the lion; for their land is become an
        astonishment because of the fierceness of the oppressing [sword],
        and because of his fierce anger.
026:001 In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah,
        king of Judah, came this word from Yahweh, saying,
026:002 Thus says Yahweh:  Stand in the court of Yahweh's house,
        and speak to all the cities of Judah, which come to worship
        in Yahweh's house, all the words that I command you to speak
        to them; don't diminish a word.
026:003 It may be they will listen, and turn every man from his evil way;
        that I may repent me of the evil which I purpose to do to them
        because of the evil of their doings.
026:004 You shall tell them, Thus says Yahweh:  If you will not listen
        to me, to walk in my law, which I have set before you,
026:005 to listen to the words of my servants the prophets,
        whom I send to you, even rising up early and sending them,
        but you have not listened;
026:006 then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this
        city a curse to all the nations of the earth.
026:007 The priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah
        speaking these words in the house of Yahweh.
026:008 It happened, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all
        that Yahweh had commanded him to speak to all the people,
        that the priests and the prophets and all the people laid
        hold on him, saying, You shall surely die.
026:009 Why have you prophesied in the name of Yahweh, saying, This house
        shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate,
        without inhabitant?  All the people were gathered to Jeremiah
        in the house of Yahweh.
026:010 When the princes of Judah heard these things, they came up
        from the king's house to the house of Yahweh; and they sat
        in the entry of the new gate of Yahweh's [house].
026:011 Then spoke the priests and the prophets to the princes
        and to all the people, saying, This man is worthy of death;
        for he has prophesied against this city, as you have heard
        with your ears.
026:012 Then spoke Jeremiah to all the princes and to all the people,
        saying, Yahweh sent me to prophesy against this house and
        against this city all the words that you have heard.
026:013 Now therefore amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice
        of Yahweh your God; and Yahweh will repent him of the evil
        that he has pronounced against you.
026:014 But as for me, behold, I am in your hand:  do with me as is
        good and right in your eyes.
026:015 Only know for certain that, if you put me to death,
        you will bring innocent blood on yourselves, and on this city,
        and on the inhabitants of it; for of a truth Yahweh has sent
        me to you to speak all these words in your ears.
026:016 Then said the princes and all the people to the priests
        and to the prophets:  This man is not worthy of death;
        for he has spoken to us in the name of Yahweh our God.
026:017 Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spoke
        to all the assembly of the people, saying,
026:018 Micah the Morashtite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king
        of Judah; and he spoke to all the people of Judah, saying,
        Thus says Yahweh of Armies:  Zion shall be plowed as a field,
        and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house
        as the high places of a forest.
026:019 Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him to death?
        Didn't he fear Yahweh, and entreat the favor of Yahweh, and Yahweh
        repented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them?
        Thus should we commit great evil against our own souls.
026:020 There was also a man who prophesied in the name
        of Yahweh, Uriah the son of Shemaiah of Kiriath Jearim;
        and he prophesied against this city and against this land
        according to all the words of Jeremiah:
026:021 and when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men,
        and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put
        him to death; but when Uriah heard it, he was afraid, and fled,
        and went into Egypt:
026:022 and Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, [namely], Elnathan
        the son of Achbor, and certain men with him, into Egypt;
026:023 and they fetched forth Uriah out of Egypt, and brought him
        to Jehoiakim the king, who killed him with the sword,
        and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.
026:024 But the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah,
        that they should not give him into the hand of the people
        to put him to death.
027:001 In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah,
        king of Judah, came this word to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,
027:002 Thus says Yahweh to me:  Make you bonds and bars, and put them
        on your neck;
027:003 and send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab,
        and to the king of the children of Ammon, and to the king of Tyre,
        and to the king of Sidon, by the hand of the messengers
        who come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah;
027:004 and give them a charge to their masters, saying, Thus says Yahweh
        of Armies, the God of Israel, Thus shall you tell your masters:
027:005 I have made the earth, the men and the animals that are on the surface
        of the earth, by my great power and by my outstretched arm;
        and I give it to whom it seems right to me.
027:006 Now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar
        the king of Babylon, my servant; and the animals of the field
        also have I given him to serve him.
027:007 All the nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son's son,
        until the time of his own land come:  and then many nations
        and great kings shall make him their bondservant.
027:008 It shall happen, that the nation and the kingdom which will not
        serve the same Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and that will
        not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon,
        that nation will I punish, says Yahweh, with the sword,
        and with the famine, and with the pestilence, until I have
        consumed them by his hand.
027:009 But as for you, don't you listen to your prophets, nor to
        your diviners, nor to your dreams, nor to your soothsayers,
        nor to your sorcerers, who speak to you, saying, You shall
        not serve the king of Babylon:
027:010 for they prophesy a lie to you, to remove you far from your land,
        and that I should drive you out, and you should perish.
027:011 But the nation that shall bring their neck under the yoke
        of the king of Babylon, and serve him, that [nation] will I let
        remain in their own land, says Yahweh; and they shall till it,
        and dwell therein.
027:012 I spoke to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words,
        saying, Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon,
        and serve him and his people, and live.
027:013 Why will you die, you and your people, by the sword, by the famine,
        and by the pestilence, as Yahweh has spoken concerning
        the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?
027:014 Don't listen to the words of the prophets who speak
        to you, saying, You shall not serve the king of Babylon;
        for they prophesy a lie to you.
027:015 For I have not sent them, says Yahweh, but they prophesy
        falsely in my name; that I may drive you out, and that you
        may perish, you, and the prophets who prophesy to you.
027:016 Also I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying,
        Thus says Yahweh:  Don't listen to the words of your prophets
        who prophesy to you, saying, Behold, the vessels of Yahweh's
        house shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon;
        for they prophesy a lie to you.
027:017 Don't listen to them; serve the king of Babylon, and live:
        why should this city become a desolation?
027:018 But if they be prophets, and if the word of Yahweh be with them,
        let them now make intercession to Yahweh of Armies,
        that the vessels which are left in the house of Yahweh,
        and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem,
        don't go to Babylon.
027:019 For thus says Yahweh of Armies concerning the pillars,
        and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning
        the residue of the vessels that are left in this city,
027:020 which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon didn't take,
        when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim,
        king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles
        of Judah and Jerusalem;
027:021 yes, thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel,
        concerning the vessels that are left in the house of Yahweh,
        and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem:
027:022 They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be,
        until the day that I visit them, says Yahweh; then will I
        bring them up, and restore them to this place.
028:001 It happened the same year, in the beginning of the reign of
        Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month,
        that Hananiah the son of Azzur, the prophet, who was of Gibeon,
        spoke to me in the house of Yahweh, in the presence of the priests
        and of all the people, saying,
028:002 Thus speaks Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, saying, I have
        broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.
028:003 Within two full years will I bring again into this place
        all the vessels of Yahweh's house, that Nebuchadnezzar king
        of Babylon took away from this place, and carried to Babylon:
028:004 and I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son
        of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah,
        who went to Babylon, says Yahweh; for I will break the yoke
        of the king of Babylon.
028:005 Then the prophet Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah
        in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all
        the people who stood in the house of Yahweh,
028:006 even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen:  Yahweh do so;
        Yahweh perform your words which you have prophesied,
        to bring again the vessels of Yahweh's house, and all them
        of the captivity, from Babylon to this place.
028:007 Nevertheless hear you now this word that I speak in your ears,
        and in the ears of all the people:
028:008 The prophets who have been before me and before you of old
        prophesied against many countries, and against great kingdoms,
        of war, and of evil, and of pestilence.
028:009 The prophet who prophesies of peace, when the word of the prophet
        shall happen, then shall the prophet be known, that Yahweh
        has truly sent him.
028:010 Then Hananiah the prophet took the bar from off the prophet
        Jeremiah's neck, and broke it.
028:011 Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus
        says Yahweh:  Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar
        king of Babylon within two full years from off the neck
        of all the nations.  The prophet Jeremiah went his way.
028:012 Then the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, after that Hananiah
        the prophet had broken the bar from off the neck of the
        prophet Jeremiah, saying,
028:013 Go, and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus says Yahweh:  You have
        broken the bars of wood; but you have made in their place
        bars of iron.
028:014 For thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel:  I have put
        a yoke of iron on the neck of all these nations, that they may
        serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him:
        and I have given him the animals of the field also.
028:015 Then said the prophet Jeremiah to Hananiah the prophet,
        Hear now, Hananiah:  Yahweh has not sent you; but you make
        this people to trust in a lie.
028:016 Therefore thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will send you away
        from off the surface of the earth:  this year you shall die,
        because you have spoken rebellion against Yahweh.
028:017 So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.
029:001 Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah
        the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the residue of the elders
        of the captivity, and to the priests, and to the prophets,
        and to all the people, whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away
        captive from Jerusalem to Babylon,
029:002 (after that Jeconiah the king, and the queen mother, and the eunuchs,
        [and] the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the craftsmen,
        and the smiths, were departed from Jerusalem),
029:003 by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son
        of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon
        to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon), saying,
029:004 Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, to all
        the captivity, whom I have caused to be carried away captive
        from Jerusalem to Babylon:
029:005 Build you houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens,
        and eat the fruit of them.
029:006 Take wives, and father sons and daughters; and take wives
        for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands,
        that they may bear sons and daughters; and multiply you there,
        and don't be diminished.
029:007 Seek the peace of the city where I have caused you to be carried
        away captive, and pray to Yahweh for it; for in the peace
        of it shall you have peace.
029:008 For thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel:  Don't let
        your prophets who are in the midst of you, and your diviners,
        deceive you; neither listen you to your dreams which you
        cause to be dreamed.
029:009 For they prophesy falsely to you in my name:  I have not
        sent them, says Yahweh.
029:010 For thus says Yahweh, After seventy years are accomplished
        for Babylon, I will visit you, and perform my good word
        toward you, in causing you to return to this place.
029:011 For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, says Yahweh,
        thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you hope in
        your latter end.
029:012 You shall call on me, and you shall go and pray to me,
        and I will listen to you.
029:013 You shall seek me, and find me, when you shall search for me
        with all your heart.
029:014 I will be found by you, says Yahweh, and I will turn again
        your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations,
        and from all the places where I have driven you, says Yahweh;
        and I will bring you again to the place from where I caused
        you to be carried away captive.
029:015 Because you have said, Yahweh has raised us up prophets in Babylon;
029:016 thus says Yahweh concerning the king who sits on the throne
        of David, and concerning all the people who dwell in this city,
        your brothers who haven't gone forth with you into captivity;
029:017 thus says Yahweh of Armies; Behold, I will send on them the sword,
        the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like vile figs,
        that can't be eaten, they are so bad.
029:018 I will pursue after them with the sword, with the famine,
        and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be tossed back
        and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth, to be an object
        of horror, and an astonishment, and a hissing, and a reproach,
        among all the nations where I have driven them;
029:019 because they have not listened to my words, says Yahweh,
        with which I sent to them my servants the prophets, rising up
        early and sending them; but you would not hear, says Yahweh.
029:020 Hear you therefore the word of Yahweh, all you of the captivity,
        whom I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon.
029:021 Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab
        the son of Kolaiah, and concerning Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah,
        who prophesy a lie to you in my name:  Behold, I will deliver
        them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon;
        and he shall kill them before your eyes;
029:022 and of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captives of Judah
        who are in Babylon, saying, Yahweh make you like Zedekiah
        and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire;
029:023 because they have worked folly in Israel, and have committed
        adultery with their neighbors' wives, and have spoken
        words in my name falsely, which I didn't command them;
        and I am he who knows, and am witness, says Yahweh.
029:024 Concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite you shall speak, saying,
029:025 Thus speaks Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, saying,
        Because you have sent letters in your own name to all the people
        who are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah,
        the priest, and to all the priests, saying,
029:026 Yahweh has made you priest in the place of Jehoiada the priest,
        that there may be officers in the house of Yahweh,
        for every man who is mad, and makes himself a prophet,
        that you should put him in the stocks and in shackles.
029:027 Now therefore, why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth,
        who makes himself a prophet to you,
029:028 because he has sent to us in Babylon, saying, [The captivity]
        is long:  build you houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens,
        and eat the fruit of them?
029:029 Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of
        Jeremiah the prophet.
029:030 Then came the word of Yahweh to Jeremiah, saying,
029:031 Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus says Yahweh
        concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite:  Because Shemaiah has
        prophesied to you, and I didn't send him, and he has caused
        you to trust in a lie;
029:032 therefore thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will punish Shemaiah
        the Nehelamite, and his seed; he shall not have a man to dwell
        among this people, neither shall he see the good that I
        will do to my people, says Yahweh, because he has spoken
        rebellion against Yahweh.
030:001 The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,
030:002 Thus speaks Yahweh, the God of Israel, saying, Write you all
        the words that I have spoken to you in a book.
030:003 For, behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will turn again
        the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, says Yahweh;
        and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave
        to their fathers, and they shall possess it.
030:004 These are the words that Yahweh spoke concerning Israel
        and concerning Judah.
030:005 For thus says Yahweh:  We have heard a voice of trembling,
        of fear, and not of peace.
030:006 Ask now, and see whether a man does travail with child:
        why do I see every man with his hands on his waist, as a woman
        in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?
030:007 Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it:
        it is even the time of Jacob's trouble; but he shall be saved
        out of it.
030:008 It shall come to pass in that day, says Yahweh of Armies, that I
        will break his yoke from off your neck, and will burst your bonds;
        and strangers shall no more make him their bondservant;
030:009 but they shall serve Yahweh their God, and David their king,
        whom I will raise up to them.
030:010 Therefore don't you be afraid, O Jacob my servant, says Yahweh;
        neither be dismayed, Israel:  for, behold, I will save you
        from afar, and your seed from the land of their captivity;
        and Jacob shall return, and shall be quiet and at ease,
        and none shall make him afraid.
030:011 For I am with you, says Yahweh, to save you:  for I will make
        a full end of all the nations where I have scattered you,
        but I will not make a full end of you; but I will correct
        you in measure, and will in no way leave you unpunished.
030:012 For thus says Yahweh, Your hurt is incurable,
        and your wound grievous.
030:013 There is none to plead your cause, that you may be bound up:
        you have no healing medicines.
030:014 All your lovers have forgotten you; they don't seek you:
        for I have wounded you with the wound of an enemy, with the
        chastisement of a cruel one, for the greatness of your iniquity,
        because your sins were increased.
030:015 Why cry you for your hurt? your pain is incurable:
        for the greatness of your iniquity, because your sins
        were increased, I have done these things to you.
030:016 Therefore all those who devour you shall be devoured; and all
        your adversaries, everyone of them, shall go into captivity;
        and those who despoil you shall be a spoil, and all who prey
        on you will I give for a prey.
030:017 For I will restore health to you, and I will heal you
        of your wounds, says Yahweh; because they have called you
        an outcast, [saying], It is Zion, whom no man seeks after.
030:018 Thus says Yahweh:  Behold, I will turn again the captivity
        of Jacob's tents, and have compassion on his dwelling places;
        and the city shall be built on its own hill, and the palace
        shall be inhabited after its own manner.
030:019 Out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of those who
        make merry:  and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few;
        I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.
030:020 Their children also shall be as before, and their congregation
        shall be established before me; and I will punish all
        who oppress them.
030:021 Their prince shall be of themselves, and their ruler shall proceed
        from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near,
        and he shall approach to me:  for who is he who has had boldness
        to approach to me? says Yahweh.
030:022 You shall be my people, and I will be your God.
030:023 Behold, the storm of Yahweh, [even his] wrath, is gone forth,
        a sweeping storm:  it shall burst on the head of the wicked.
030:024 The fierce anger of Yahweh shall not return, until he has executed,
        and until he have performed the intents of his heart:
        in the latter days you shall understand it.
031:001 At that time, says Yahweh, will I be the God of all the families
        of Israel, and they shall be my people.
031:002 Thus says Yahweh, The people who were left of the sword found
        favor in the wilderness; even Israel, when I went to cause
        him to rest.
031:003 Yahweh appeared of old to me, [saying], Yes, I have loved you
        with an everlasting love:  therefore with loving kindness
        have I drawn you.
031:004 Again will I build you, and you shall be built, O virgin of Israel:
        again shall you be adorned with your tambourines, and shall
        go forth in the dances of those who make merry.
031:005 Again shall you plant vineyards on the mountains of Samaria;
        the planters shall plant, and shall enjoy [the fruit of it].
031:006 For there shall be a day, that the watchmen on the hills
        of Ephraim shall cry, Arise you, and let us go up to Zion
        to Yahweh our God.
031:007 For thus says Yahweh, Sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout
        for the chief of the nations:  publish you, praise you,
        and say, Yahweh, save your people, the remnant of Israel.
031:008 Behold, I will bring them from the north country,
        and gather them from the uttermost parts of the earth,
        [and] with them the blind and the lame, the woman
        with child and her who travails with child together:
        a great company shall they return here.
031:009 They shall come with weeping; and with petitions will I lead them:
        I will cause them to walk by rivers of waters, in a straight way
        in which they shall not stumble; for I am a father to Israel,
        and Ephraim is my firstborn.
031:010 Hear the word of Yahweh, you nations, and declare it in the islands
        afar off; and say, He who scattered Israel will gather him,
        and keep him, as shepherd does his flock.
031:011 For Yahweh has ransomed Jacob, and redeemed him from the hand
        of him who was stronger than he.
031:012 They shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow
        to the goodness of Yahweh, to the grain, and to the new wine,
        and to the oil, and to the young of the flock and of the herd:
        and their soul shall be as a watered garden; and they shall
        not sorrow any more at all.
031:013 Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, and the young men
        and the old together; for I will turn their mourning into joy,
        and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow.
031:014 I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my
        people shall be satisfied with my goodness, says Yahweh.
031:015 Thus says Yahweh:  A voice is heard in Ramah, lamentation,
        and bitter weeping, Rachel weeping for her children;
        she refuses to be comforted for her children, because they
        are no more.
031:016 Thus says Yahweh:  Refrain your voice from weeping, and your
        eyes from tears; for your work shall be rewarded, says Yahweh;
        and they shall come again from the land of the enemy.
031:017 There is hope for your latter end, says Yahweh; and [your]
        children shall come again to their own border.
031:018 I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself [thus],
        You have chastised me, and I was chastised, as a calf
        unaccustomed [to the yoke]: turn you me, and I shall be turned;
        for you are Yahweh my God.
031:019 Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I
        was instructed, I struck on my thigh:  I was ashamed, yes,
        even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth.
031:020 Is Ephraim my dear son? is he a darling child? for as often
        as I speak against him, I do earnestly remember him still:
        therefore my heart yearns for him; I will surely have mercy
        on him, says Yahweh.
031:021 Set up road signs, make guideposts; set your heart toward
        the highway, even the way by which you went:  turn again,
        virgin of Israel, turn again to these your cities.
031:022 How long will you go here and there, you backsliding
        daughter? for Yahweh has created a new thing in the earth:
        a woman shall encompass a man.
031:023 Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, Yet again shall they
        use this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities of it,
        when I shall bring again their captivity:  Yahweh bless you,
        habitation of righteousness, mountain of holiness.
031:024 Judah and all the cities of it shall dwell therein together,
        the farmers, and those who go about with flocks.
031:025 For I have satiated the weary soul, and every sorrowful soul
        have I replenished.
031:026 On this I awakened, and saw; and my sleep was sweet to me.
031:027 Behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will sow the house
        of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man,
        and with the seed of animal.
031:028 It shall happen that, like as I have watched over them to pluck up
        and to break down and to overthrow and to destroy and to afflict,
        so will I watch over them to build and to plant, says Yahweh.
031:029 In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten
        sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge.
031:030 But everyone shall die for his own iniquity:  every man who eats
        the sour grapes, his teeth shall be set on edge.
031:031 Behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will make a new
        covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:
031:032 not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers
        in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them
        out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they broke,
        although I was a husband to them, says Yahweh.
031:033 But this is the covenant that I will make with the house
        of Israel after those days, says Yahweh:  I will put my law
        in their inward parts, and in their heart will I write it;
        and I will be their God, and they shall be my people:
031:034 and they shall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man
        his brother, saying, Know Yahweh; for they shall all know me,
        from the least of them to the greatest of them, says Yahweh:
        for I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin will I
        remember no more.
031:035 Thus says Yahweh, who gives the sun for a light by day,
        and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light
        by night, who stirs up the sea, so that the waves of it roar;
        Yahweh of Armies is his name:
031:036 If these ordinances depart from before me, says Yahweh,
        then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation
        before me forever.
031:037 Thus says Yahweh:  If heaven above can be measured,
        and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath,
        then will I also cast off all the seed of Israel for all
        that they have done, says Yahweh.
031:038 Behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that the city shall be built
        to Yahweh from the tower of Hananel to the gate of the corner.
031:039 The measuring line shall go out further straight onward
        to the hill Gareb, and shall turn about to Goah.
031:040 The whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes,
        and all the fields to the brook Kidron, to the corner
        of the horse gate toward the east, shall be holy to Yahweh;
        it shall not be plucked up, nor thrown down any more forever.
032:001 The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh in the tenth
        year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth
        year of Nebuchadnezzar.
032:002 Now at that time the king of Babylon's army was besieging Jerusalem;
        and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard,
        which was in the king of Judah's house.
032:003 For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Why do
        you prophesy, and say, Thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will
        give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon,
        and he shall take it;
032:004 and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand
        of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand
        of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth,
        and his eyes shall see his eyes;
032:005 and he shall bring Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until
        I visit him, says Yahweh:  though you fight with the Chaldeans,
        you shall not prosper?
032:006 Jeremiah said, The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
032:007 Behold, Hanamel the son of Shallum your uncle shall come
        to you, saying, Buy you my field that is in Anathoth;
        for the right of redemption is yours to buy it.
032:008 So Hanamel my uncle's son came to me in the court of the guard
        according to the word of Yahweh, and said to me, Please buy
        my field that is in Anathoth, which is in the land of Benjamin;
        for the right of inheritance is yours, and the redemption
        is yours; buy it for yourself.  Then I knew that this was
        the word of Yahweh.
032:009 I bought the field that was in Anathoth of Hanamel my uncle's son,
        and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver.
032:010 I subscribed the deed, and sealed it, and called witnesses,
        and weighed him the money in the balances.
032:011 So I took the deed of the purchase, both that which was sealed,
        containing the terms and conditions, and that which was open;
032:012 and I delivered the deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah,
        the son of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel my uncle's son,
        and in the presence of the witnesses who subscribed the deed
        of the purchase, before all the Jews who sat in the court
        of the guard.
032:013 I charged Baruch before them, saying,
032:014 Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel:  Take these deeds,
        this deed of the purchase which is sealed, and this deed
        which is open, and put them in an earthen vessel; that they
        may continue many days.
032:015 For thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel:  Houses and
        fields and vineyards shall yet again be bought in this land.
032:016 Now after I had delivered the deed of the purchase to Baruch
        the son of Neriah, I prayed to Yahweh, saying,
032:017 Ah Lord Yahweh! behold, you have made the heavens and
        the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm;
        there is nothing too hard for you,
032:018 who show loving kindness to thousands, and recompense the iniquity
        of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them;
        the great, the mighty God, Yahweh of Armies is his name;
032:019 great in counsel, and mighty in work; whose eyes are open on
        all the ways of the sons of men, to give everyone according
        to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings:
032:020 who performed signs and wonders in the land of Egypt,
        even to this day, both in Israel and among [other] men;
        and made you a name, as in this day;
032:021 and brought forth your people Israel out of the land of Egypt
        with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand,
        and with an outstretched arm, and with great terror;
032:022 and gave them this land, which you did swear to their fathers
        to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey;
032:023 and they came in, and possessed it, but they didn't
        obey your voice, neither walked in your law; they have
        done nothing of all that you commanded them to do:
        therefore you have caused all this evil to come on them.
032:024 Behold, the mounds, they are come to the city to take it;
        and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans who
        fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine,
        and of the pestilence; and what you have spoken has happened;
        and behold, you see it.
032:025 You have said to me, Lord Yahweh, Buy you the field for money,
        and call witnesses; whereas the city is given into the hand
        of the Chaldeans.
032:026 Then came the word of Yahweh to Jeremiah, saying,
032:027 Behold, I am Yahweh, the God of all flesh:  is there anything
        too hard for me?
032:028 Therefore thus says Yahweh:  Behold, I will give this city into
        the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar
        king of Babylon, and he shall take it:
032:029 and the Chaldeans, who fight against this city, shall come
        and set this city on fire, and burn it, with the houses,
        on whose roofs they have offered incense to Baal, and poured
        out drink offerings to other gods, to provoke me to anger.
032:030 For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have
        done only that which was evil in my sight from their youth;
        for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger
        with the work of their hands, says Yahweh.
032:031 For this city has been to me a provocation of my anger and of
        my wrath from the day that they built it even to this day;
        that I should remove it from before my face,
032:032 because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children
        of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they,
        their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets,
        and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
032:033 They have turned to me the back, and not the face:
        and though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them,
        yet they have not listened to receive instruction.
032:034 But they set their abominations in the house which is called
        by my name, to defile it.
032:035 They built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley
        of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters
        to pass through [the fire] to Molech; which I didn't
        command them, neither did it come into my mind, that they
        should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.
032:036 Now therefore thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel,
        concerning this city, about which you say, It is given into
        the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine,
        and by the pestilence:
032:037 Behold, I will gather them out of all the countries,
        where I have driven them in my anger, and in my wrath, and in
        great indignation; and I will bring them again to this place,
        and I will cause them to dwell safely:
032:038 and they shall be my people, and I will be their God:
032:039 and I will give them one heart and one way, that they
        may fear me forever, for the good of them, and of their
        children after them:
032:040 and I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I
        will not turn away from following them, to do them good;
        and I will put my fear in their hearts, that they may not
        depart from me.
032:041 Yes, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant
        them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with
        my whole soul.
032:042 For thus says Yahweh:  Like as I have brought all this great evil
        on this people, so will I bring on them all the good that I
        have promised them.
032:043 Fields shall be bought in this land, about which you say,
        It is desolate, without man or animal; it is given into the hand
        of the Chaldeans.
032:044 Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe the deeds,
        and seal them, and call witnesses, in the land of Benjamin,
        and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah,
        and in the cities of the hill country, and in the cities
        of the lowland, and in the cities of the South:
        for I will cause their captivity to return, says Yahweh.
033:001 Moreover the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah the second time,
        while he was yet shut up in the court of the guard, saying,
033:002 Thus says Yahweh who does it, Yahweh who forms it to establish it;
        Yahweh is his name:
033:003 Call to me, and I will answer you, and will show you great things,
        and difficult, which you don't know.
033:004 For thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, concerning the houses
        of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah,
        which are broken down [to make a defense] against the mounds
        and against the sword;
033:005 while [men] come to fight with the Chaldeans, and to fill them
        with the dead bodies of men, whom I have killed in my anger
        and in my wrath, and for all whose wickedness I have hid
        my face from this city:
033:006 Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them;
        and I will reveal to them abundance of peace and truth.
033:007 I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel
        to return, and will build them, as at the first.
033:008 I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, by which they
        have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities,
        by which they have sinned against me, and by which they
        have transgressed against me.
033:009 [This city] shall be to me for a name of joy, for a praise
        and for a glory, before all the nations of the earth,
        which shall hear all the good that I do to them, and shall
        fear and tremble for all the good and for all the peace that I
        procure to it.
033:010 Thus says Yahweh:  Yet again there shall be heard in this place,
        about which you say, It is waste, without man and without animal,
        even in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem,
        that are desolate, without man and without inhabitant
        and without animal,
033:011 the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of
        the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of those
        who say, Give thanks to Yahweh of Armies, for Yahweh is good,
        for his loving kindness endures forever; [and of them] who
        bring [sacrifices of] thanksgiving into the house of Yahweh.
        For I will cause the captivity of the land to return as at
        the first, says Yahweh.
033:012 Thus says Yahweh of Armies:  Yet again shall there be in
        this place, which is waste, without man and without animal,
        and in all the cities of it, a habitation of shepherds causing
        their flocks to lie down.
033:013 In the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the lowland,
        and in the cities of the South, and in the land of Benjamin,
        and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah,
        shall the flocks again pass under the hands of him who
        numbers them, says Yahweh.
033:014 Behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will perform that
        good word which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel
        and concerning the house of Judah.
033:015 In those days, and at that time, will I cause a Branch
        of righteousness to grow up to David; and he shall execute
        justice and righteousness in the land.
033:016 In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely;
        and this is [the name] by which she shall be called:
        Yahweh our righteousness.
033:017 For thus says Yahweh:  David shall never want a man to sit
        on the throne of the house of Israel;
033:018 neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me
        to offer burnt offerings, and to burn meal offerings,
        and to do sacrifice continually.
033:019 The word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, saying,
033:020 Thus says Yahweh:  If you can break my covenant of the day,
        and my covenant of the night, so that there shall not be day
        and night in their season;
033:021 then may also my covenant be broken with David my servant,
        that he shall not have a son to reign on his throne;
        and with the Levites the priests, my ministers.
033:022 As the army of the sky can't be numbered, neither the sand
        of the sea measured; so will I multiply the seed of David
        my servant, and the Levites who minister to me.
033:023 The word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, saying,
033:024 Don't you consider what this people has spoken, saying, The two
        families which Yahweh did choose, he has cast them off?
        thus do they despise my people, that they should be no more
        a nation before them.
033:025 Thus says Yahweh:  If my covenant of day and night fails,
        if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth;
033:026 then will I also cast away the seed of Jacob, and of David
        my servant, so that I will not take of his seed to be
        rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob:
        for I will cause their captivity to return, and will have
        mercy on them.
034:001 The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, when Nebuchadnezzar
        king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of
        the earth that were under his dominion, and all the peoples,
        were fighting against Jerusalem, and against all the cities
        of it, saying:
034:002 Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, Go, and speak to Zedekiah
        king of Judah, and tell him, Thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will
        give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon,
        and he shall burn it with fire:
034:003 and you shall not escape out of his hand, but shall surely
        be taken, and delivered into his hand; and your eyes shall see
        the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with you
        mouth to mouth, and you shall go to Babylon.
034:004 Yet hear the word of Yahweh, O Zedekiah king of Judah:
        thus says Yahweh concerning you, You shall not die by the sword;
034:005 you shall die in peace; and with the burnings of your fathers,
        the former kings who were before you, so shall they make
        a burning for you; and they shall lament you, [saying], Ah Lord!
        for I have spoken the word, says Yahweh.
034:006 Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah
        king of Judah in Jerusalem,
034:007 when the king of Babylon's army was fighting against Jerusalem,
        and against all the cities of Judah that were left,
        against Lachish and against Azekah; for these [alone] remained
        of the cities of Judah [as] fortified cities.
034:008 The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, after that the king
        Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people who were
        at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty to them;
034:009 that every man should let his male servant, and every man
        his female servant, who is a Hebrew or a Hebrewess, go free;
        that none should make bondservants of them, [to wit],
        of a Jew his brother.
034:010 All the princes and all the people obeyed, who had entered
        into the covenant, that everyone should let his male servant,
        and everyone his female servant, go free, that none should make
        bondservants of them any more; they obeyed, and let them go:
034:011 but afterwards they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids,
        whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into
        subjection for servants and for handmaids.
034:012 Therefore the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,
034:013 Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel:  I made a covenant
        with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out
        of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, saying,
034:014 At the end of seven years you shall let go every man his
        brother who is a Hebrew, who has been sold to you, and has
        served you six years, you shall let him go free from you:
        but your fathers didn't listen to me, neither inclined their ear.
034:015 You were now turned, and had done that which is right in my eyes,
        in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbor; and you
        had made a covenant before me in the house which is called
        by my name:
034:016 but you turned and profaned my name, and caused every man
        his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom you had let
        go free at their pleasure, to return; and you brought them
        into subjection, to be to you for servants and for handmaids.
034:017 Therefore thus says Yahweh:  you have not listened to me,
        to proclaim liberty, every man to his brother, and every
        man to his neighbor:  behold, I proclaim to you a liberty,
        says Yahweh, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine;
        and I will make you to be tossed back and forth among all
        the kingdoms of the earth.
034:018 I will give the men who have transgressed my covenant,
        who have not performed the words of the covenant which they
        made before me, when they cut the calf in two and passed
        between the parts of it;
034:019 the princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs,
        and the priests, and all the people of the land, who passed
        between the parts of the calf;
034:020 I will even give them into the hand of their enemies,
        and into the hand of those who seek their life; and their
        dead bodies shall be for food to the birds of the sky,
        and to the animals of the earth.
034:021 Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into
        the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those who seek
        their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon's army,
        who have gone away from you.
034:022 Behold, I will command, says Yahweh, and cause them to return
        to this city; and they shall fight against it, and take it,
        and burn it with fire:  and I will make the cities of Judah
        a desolation, without inhabitant.
035:001 The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh in the days
        of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying,
035:002 Go to the house of the Rechabites, and speak to them, and bring
        them into the house of Yahweh, into one of the chambers,
        and give them wine to drink.
035:003 Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah,
        and his brothers, and all his sons, and the whole house
        of the Rechabites;
035:004 and I brought them into the house of Yahweh, into the chamber
        of the sons of Hanan the son of Igdaliah, the man of God,
        which was by the chamber of the princes, which was above
        the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper
        of the threshold.
035:005 I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites bowls
        full of wine, and cups; and I said to them, Drink you wine.
035:006 But they said, We will drink no wine; for Jonadab the son of Rechab,
        our father, commanded us, saying, You shall drink no wine,
        neither you, nor your sons, forever:
035:007 neither shall you build house, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard,
        nor have any; but all your days you shall dwell in tents;
        that you may live many days in the land in which you sojourn.
035:008 We have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab,
        our father, in all that he charged us, to drink no wine all
        our days, we, our wives, our sons, or our daughters;
035:009 nor to build houses for us to dwell in; neither have we vineyard,
        nor field, nor seed:
035:010 but we have lived in tents, and have obeyed, and done according
        to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.
035:011 But it happened, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up
        into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem
        for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army
        of the Syrians; so we dwell at Jerusalem.
035:012 Then came the word of Yahweh to Jeremiah, saying,
035:013 Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel:  Go, and tell
        the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will you
        not receive instruction to listen to my words? says Yahweh.
035:014 The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded
        his sons, not to drink wine, are performed; and to this day
        they drink none, for they obey their father's commandment:
        but I have spoken to you, rising up early and speaking;
        and you have not listened to me.
035:015 I have sent also to you all my servants the prophets,
        rising up early and sending them, saying, Return you
        now every man from his evil way, and amend your doings,
        and don't go after other gods to serve them, and you shall dwell
        in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers:
        but you have not inclined your ear, nor listened to me.
035:016 Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed
        the commandment of their father which he commanded them,
        but this people has not listened to me;
035:017 therefore thus says Yahweh, the God of Armies, the God
        of Israel:  Behold, I will bring on Judah and on all the inhabitants
        of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them;
        because I have spoken to them, but they have not heard;
        and I have called to them, but they have not answered.
035:018 Jeremiah said to the house of the Rechabites, Thus says Yahweh
        of Armies, the God of Israel:  Because you have obeyed the
        commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts,
        and done according to all that he commanded you;
035:019 therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel:  Jonadab the
        son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me forever.
036:001 It happened in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah,
        king of Judah, that this word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,
036:002 Take a scroll of a book, and write therein all the words
        that I have spoken to you against Israel, and against Judah,
        and against all the nations, from the day I spoke to you,
        from the days of Josiah, even to this day.
036:003 It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil
        which I purpose to do to them; that they may return every
        man from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity
        and their sin.
036:004 Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah; and Baruch
        wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of Yahweh,
        which he had spoken to him, on a scroll of a book.
036:005 Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I can't go
        into the house of Yahweh:
036:006 therefore go you, and read in the scroll, which you have written
        from my mouth, the words of Yahweh in the ears of the people
        in Yahweh's house on the fast day; and also you shall read
        them in the ears of all Judah who come out of their cities.
036:007 It may be they will present their supplication before Yahweh,
        and will return everyone from his evil way; for great is the anger
        and the wrath that Yahweh has pronounced against this people.
036:008 Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah
        the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words
        of Yahweh in Yahweh's house.
036:009 Now it happened in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah,
        king of Judah, in the ninth month, that all the people
        in Jerusalem, and all the people who came from the cities
        of Judah to Jerusalem, proclaimed a fast before Yahweh.
036:010 Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house
        of Yahweh, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan,
        the scribe, in the upper court, at the entry of the new gate
        of Yahweh's house, in the ears of all the people.
036:011 When Micaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan,
        had heard out of the book all the words of Yahweh,
036:012 he went down into the king's house, into the scribe's chamber:
        and behold, all the princes were sitting there, [to wit],
        Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah,
        and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan,
        and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes.
036:013 Then Micaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard,
        when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people.
036:014 Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah,
        the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying,
        Take in your hand the scroll in which you have read in the ears
        of the people, and come.  So Baruch the son of Neriah took
        the scroll in his hand, and came to them.
036:015 They said to him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears.
        So Baruch read it in their ears.
036:016 Now it happened, when they had heard all the words, they turned
        in fear one toward another, and said to Baruch, We will surely
        tell the king of all these words.
036:017 They asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How did you write
        all these words at his mouth?
036:018 Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words to me
        with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.
036:019 Then said the princes to Baruch, Go, hide you, you and Jeremiah;
        and let no man know where you are.
036:020 They went in to the king into the court; but they had laid
        up the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe;
        and they told all the words in the ears of the king.
036:021 So the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll; and he took it
        out of the chamber of Elishama the scribe.  Jehudi read it
        in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes
        who stood beside the king.
036:022 Now the king was sitting in the winter house in the ninth month:
        and [there was a fire in] the brazier burning before him.
036:023 It happened, when Jehudi had read three or four leaves,
        that [the king] cut it with the penknife, and cast it into
        the fire that was in the brazier, until all the scroll was
        consumed in the fire that was in the brazier.
036:024 They were not afraid, nor tore their garments, neither the king,
        nor any of his servants who heard all these words.
036:025 Moreover Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made
        intercession to the king that he would not burn the scroll;
        but he would not hear them.
036:026 The king commanded Jerahmeel the king's son, and Seraiah the son
        of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch
        the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet; but Yahweh hid them.
036:027 Then the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, after that the king
        had burned the scroll, and the words which Baruch wrote
        at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,
036:028 Take again another scroll, and write in it all the former
        words that were in the first scroll, which Jehoiakim the king
        of Judah has burned.
036:029 Concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you shall say,
        Thus says Yahweh:  You have burned this scroll, saying,
        Why have you written therein, saying, The king of Babylon
        shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause
        to cease from there man and animal?
036:030 Therefore thus says Yahweh concerning Jehoiakim king
        of Judah:  He shall have none to sit on the throne of David;
        and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat,
        and in the night to the frost.
036:031 I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity;
        and I will bring on them, and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
        and on the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced
        against them, but they didn't listen.
036:032 Then took Jeremiah another scroll, and gave it to Baruch
        the scribe, the son of Neriah, who wrote therein from the mouth
        of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king
        of Judah had burned in the fire; and there were added besides
        to them many like words.
037:001 Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned as king, instead of Coniah
        the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon
        made king in the land of Judah.
037:002 But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land,
        did listen to the words of Yahweh, which he spoke by
        the prophet Jeremiah.
037:003 Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah
        the son of Maaseiah, the priest, to the prophet Jeremiah,
        saying, Pray now to Yahweh our God for us.
037:004 Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people; for they
        had not put him into prison.
037:005 Pharaoh's army was come forth out of Egypt; and when the
        Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard news of them,
        they broke up from Jerusalem.
037:006 Then came the word of Yahweh to the prophet Jeremiah, saying,
037:007 Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, Thus shall you tell
        the king of Judah, who sent you to me to inquire of me:
        Behold, Pharaoh's army, which is come forth to help you,
        shall return to Egypt into their own land.
037:008 The Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city;
        and they shall take it, and burn it with fire.
037:009 Thus says Yahweh, Don't deceive yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans
        shall surely depart from us; for they shall not depart.
037:010 For though you had struck the whole army of the Chaldeans
        who fight against you, and there remained but wounded men
        among them, yes would they rise up every man in his tent,
        and burn this city with fire.
037:011 It happened that, when the army of the Chaldeans was broken
        up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh's army,
037:012 then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land
        of Benjamin, to receive his portion there, in the midst
        of the people.
037:013 When he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the guard
        was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah,
        the son of Hananiah; and he laid hold on Jeremiah the prophet,
        saying, You are falling away to the Chaldeans.
037:014 Then said Jeremiah, It is false; I am not falling away to
        the Chaldeans.  But he didn't listen to him; so Irijah laid
        hold on Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes.
037:015 The princes were angry with Jeremiah, and struck him,
        and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe;
        for they had made that the prison.
037:016 When Jeremiah was come into the dungeon house, and into the cells,
        and Jeremiah had remained there many days;
037:017 Then Zedekiah the king sent, and fetched him:
        and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said,
        Is there any word from Yahweh?  Jeremiah said, There is.
        He said also, You shall be delivered into the hand of the
        king of Babylon.
037:018 Moreover Jeremiah said to king Zedekiah, Wherein have I sinned
        against you, or against your servants, or against this people,
        that you have put me in prison?
037:019 Where now are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, The king
        of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?
037:020 Now please hear, my lord the king:  please let my supplication
        be presented before you, that you not cause me to return
        to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.
037:021 Then Zedekiah the king commanded, and they committed Jeremiah
        into the court of the guard; and they gave him daily a loaf
        of bread out of the bakers' street, until all the bread
        in the city was spent.  Thus Jeremiah remained in the court
        of the guard.
038:001 Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashhur,
        and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchijah,
        heard the words that Jeremiah spoke to all the people, saying,
038:002 Thus says Yahweh, He who remains in this city shall die
        by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence;
        but he who goes forth to the Chaldeans shall live, and his
        life shall be to him for a prey, and he shall live.
038:003 Thus says Yahweh, This city shall surely be given into the hand
        of the army of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it.
038:004 Then the princes said to the king, Let this man, we pray you,
        be put to death; because he weakens the hands of the men of war
        who remain in this city, and the hands of all the people,
        in speaking such words to them:  for this man doesn't seek
        the welfare of this people, but the hurt.
038:005 Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand;
        for the king is not he who can do anything against you.
038:006 Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of
        Malchijah the king's son, that was in the court of the guard:
        and they let down Jeremiah with cords.  In the dungeon there
        was no water, but mire; and Jeremiah sank in the mire.
038:007 Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, a eunuch, who was in the
        king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon
        (the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin),
038:008 Ebedmelech went forth out of the king's house, and spoke
        to the king, saying,
038:009 My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they
        have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into
        the dungeon; and he is likely to die in the place where he is,
        because of the famine; for there is no more bread in the city.
038:010 Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying,
        Take from hence thirty men with you, and take up Jeremiah
        the prophet out of the dungeon, before he dies.
038:011 So Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went into the house
        of the king under the treasury, and took there rags
        and worn-out garments, and let them down by cords into
        the dungeon to Jeremiah.
038:012 Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, Put now these rags
        and worn-out garments under your armholes under the cords.
        Jeremiah did so.
038:013 So they drew up Jeremiah with the cords, and took him up
        out of the dungeon:  and Jeremiah remained in the court
        of the guard.
038:014 Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet
        to him into the third entry that is in the house of Yahweh:
        and the king said to Jeremiah, I will ask you a thing;
        hide nothing from me.
038:015 Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, If I declare it to you,
        will you not surely put me to death? and if I give you counsel,
        you will not listen to me.
038:016 So Zedekiah the king swore secretly to Jeremiah, saying,
        As Yahweh lives, who made us this soul, I will not put you
        to death, neither will I give you into the hand of these men
        who seek your life.
038:017 Then said Jeremiah to Zedekiah, Thus says Yahweh, the God
        of Armies, the God of Israel:  If you will go forth to the king
        of Babylon's princes, then your soul shall live, and this
        city shall not be burned with fire; and you shall live,
        and your house.
038:018 But if you will not go forth to the king of Babylon's princes,
        then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans,
        and they shall burn it with fire, and you shall not escape
        out of their hand.
038:019 Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews
        who are fallen away to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me
        into their hand, and they mock me.
038:020 But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver you.  Obey, I beg you,
        the voice of Yahweh, in that which I speak to you:
        so it shall be well with you, and your soul shall live.
038:021 But if you refuse to go forth, this is the word that Yahweh
        has shown me:
038:022 behold, all the women who are left in the king of Judah's house
        shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon's princes,
        and those women shall say, Your familiar friends have set you on,
        and have prevailed over you:  [now that] your feet are sunk
        in the mire, they are turned away back.
038:023 They shall bring out all your wives and your children to
        the Chaldeans; and you shall not escape out of their hand,
        but shall be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon:
        and you shall cause this city to be burned with fire.
038:024 Then said Zedekiah to Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words,
        and you shall not die.
038:025 But if the princes hear that I have talked with you, and they
        come to you, and tell you, Declare to us now what you have said
        to the king; don't hide it from us, and we will not put you
        to death; also what the king said to you:
038:026 then you shall tell them, I presented my supplication before the king,
        that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan's house,
        to die there.
038:027 Then came all the princes to Jeremiah, and asked him;
        and he told them according to all these words that the king
        had commanded.  So they left off speaking with him;
        for the matter was not perceived.
038:028 So Jeremiah abode in the court of the guard until the day
        that Jerusalem was taken.
039:001 It happened when Jerusalem was taken, (in the ninth year of
        Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadnezzar
        king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem,
        and besieged it;
039:002 in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month,
        the ninth day of the month, a breach was made in the city),
039:003 that all the princes of the king of Babylon came in,
        and sat in the middle gate, [to wit], Nergal Sharezer,
        Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergal Sharezer, Rabmag,
        with all the rest of the princes of the king of Babylon.
039:004 It happened that, when Zedekiah the king of Judah and all
        the men of war saw them, then they fled, and went forth
        out of the city by night, by the way of the king's garden,
        through the gate between the two walls; and he went out
        toward the Arabah.
039:005 But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after them, and overtook
        Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho:  and when they had taken him,
        they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah
        in the land of Hamath; and he gave judgment on him.
039:006 Then the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah
        before his eyes:  also the king of Babylon killed all
        the nobles of Judah.
039:007 Moreover he put out Zedekiah's eyes, and bound him in fetters,
        to carry him to Babylon.
039:008 The Chaldeans burned the king's house, and the houses of the people,
        with fire, and broke down the walls of Jerusalem.
039:009 Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive
        into Babylon the residue of the people who remained in the city,
        the deserters also who fell away to him, and the residue
        of the people who remained.
039:010 But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor
        of the people, who had nothing, in the land of Judah,
        and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.
039:011 Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning
        Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying,
039:012 Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm;
        but do to him even as he shall tell you.
039:013 So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent,
        and Nebushazban, Rabsaris, and Nergal Sharezer, Rabmag, and all
        the chief officers of the king of Babylon;
039:014 they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guard,
        and committed him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam,
        the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home:
        so he lived among the people.
039:015 Now the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, while he was shut up
        in the court of the guard, saying,
039:016 Go, and speak to Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus says
        Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel:  Behold, I will bring
        my words on this city for evil, and not for good; and they
        shall be accomplished before you in that day.
039:017 But I will deliver you in that day, says Yahweh; and you shall
        not be given into the hand of the men of whom you are afraid.
039:018 For I will surely save you, and you shall not fall by the sword,
        but your life shall be for a prey to you; because you have put
        your trust in me, says Yahweh.
040:001 The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, after that
        Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah,
        when he had taken him being bound in chains among all
        the captives of Jerusalem and Judah, who were carried away
        captive to Babylon.
040:002 The captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said to him,
        Yahweh your God pronounced this evil on this place;
040:003 and Yahweh has brought it, and done according as he spoke:
        because you have sinned against Yahweh, and have not obeyed
        his voice, therefore this thing is come on you.
040:004 Now, behold, I loose you this day from the chains which are
        on your hand.  If it seems good to you to come with me
        into Babylon, come, and I will take care of you; but if it
        seems bad to you to come with me into Babylon, don't: behold,
        all the land is before you; where it seems good and right
        to you to go, there go.
040:005 Now while he was not yet gone back, Go back then, [said he],
        to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king
        of Babylon has made governor over the cities of Judah,
        and dwell with him among the people; or go wherever it seems
        right to you to go.  So the captain of the guard gave him
        food and a present, and let him go.
040:006 Then went Jeremiah to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah,
        and lived with him among the people who were left in the land.
040:007 Now when all the captains of the forces who were in the fields,
        even they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon
        had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land,
        and had committed to him men, and women, and children,
        and of the poorest of the land, of those who were not carried
        away captive to Babylon;
040:008 then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, [to wit], Ishmael the son
        of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah,
        and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai
        the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite,
        they and their men.
040:009 Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan swore to them and
        to their men, saying, Don't be afraid to serve the Chaldeans:
        dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it
        shall be well with you.
040:010 As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to stand before
        the Chaldeans who shall come to us:  but you, gather you wine
        and summer fruits and oil, and put them in your vessels,
        and dwell in your cities that you have taken.
040:011 Likewise when all the Jews who were in Moab, and among the children
        of Ammon, and in Edom, and who were in all the countries,
        heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah,
        and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam,
        the son of Shaphan;
040:012 then all the Jews returned out of all places where they
        were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah,
        to Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits very much.
040:013 Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of
        the forces who were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah,
040:014 and said to him, Do you know that Baalis the king of the children
        of Ammon has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take your life?
        But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam didn't believe them.
040:015 Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke to Gedaliah in
        Mizpah secretly, saying, Please let me go, and I will kill
        Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know it:
        why should he take your life, that all the Jews who are gathered
        to you should be scattered, and the remnant of Judah perish?
040:016 But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son
        of Kareah, You shall not do this thing; for you speak
        falsely of Ishmael.
041:001 Now it happened in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son
        of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal and [one
        of] the chief officers of the king, and ten men with him,
        came to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they
        ate bread together in Mizpah.
041:002 Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men who
        were with him, and struck Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son
        of Shaphan with the sword, and killed him, whom the king
        of Babylon had made governor over the land.
041:003 Ishmael also killed all the Jews who were with him, [to wit],
        with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans who were found there,
        the men of war.
041:004 It happened the second day after he had killed Gedaliah,
        and no man knew it,
041:005 that there came men from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria,
        even eighty men, having their beards shaved and their clothes torn,
        and having cut themselves, with meal offerings and frankincense
        in their hand, to bring them to the house of Yahweh.
041:006 Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them,
        weeping all along as he went:  and it happened, as he met them,
        he said to them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.
041:007 It was so, when they came into the midst of the city,
        that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah killed them, [and cast them]
        into the midst of the pit, he, and the men who were with him.
041:008 But ten men were found among those who said to Ishmael, Don't kill us;
        for we have stores hidden in the field, of wheat, and of barley,
        and of oil, and of honey.  So he stopped, and didn't kill
        them among their brothers.
041:009 Now the pit in which Ishmael cast all the dead bodies
        of the men whom he had killed, by the side of Gedaliah
        (the same was who which Asa the king had made for fear of
        Baasha king of Israel), Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled
        it with those who were killed.
041:010 Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of
        the people who were in Mizpah, even the king's daughters,
        and all the people who remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan
        the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son
        of Ahikam; Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive,
        and departed to go over to the children of Ammon.
041:011 But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains
        of the forces who were with him, heard of all the evil
        that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,
041:012 then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael
        the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters
        that are in Gibeon.
041:013 Now it happened that, when all the people who were with Ishmael
        saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces
        who were with him, then they were glad.
041:014 So all the people who Ishmael had carried away captive
        from Mizpah turned about and came back, and went to Johanan
        the son of Kareah.
041:015 But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with
        eight men, and went to the children of Ammon.
041:016 Then took Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains
        of the forces who were with him, all the remnant of the people
        whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah,
        from Mizpah, after that he had killed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam,
        [to wit], the men of war, and the women, and the children,
        and the eunuchs, whom he had brought back from Gibeon:
041:017 and they departed, and lived in Geruth Chimham, which is
        by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt,
041:018 because of the Chaldeans; for they were afraid of them,
        because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had killed Gedaliah
        the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor
        over the land.
042:001 Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah,
        and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from
        the least even to the greatest, came near,
042:002 and said to Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we pray you, our supplication
        be presented before you, and pray for us to Yahweh your God,
        even for all this remnant; for we are left but a few of many,
        as your eyes do see us:
042:003 that Yahweh your God may show us the way in which we should walk,
        and the thing that we should do.
042:004 Then Jeremiah the prophet said to them, I have heard you;
        behold, I will pray to Yahweh your God according to your words;
        and it shall happen that whatever thing Yahweh shall answer you,
        I will declare it to you; I will keep nothing back from you.
042:005 Then they said to Jeremiah, Yahweh be a true and faithful
        witness among us, if we don't do according to all the word
        with which Yahweh your God shall send you to us.
042:006 Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will obey the voice
        of Yahweh our God, to whom we send you; that it may be well
        with us, when we obey the voice of Yahweh our God.
042:007 It happened after ten days, that the word of Yahweh
        came to Jeremiah.
042:008 Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains
        of the forces who were with him, and all the people from
        the least even to the greatest,
042:009 and said to them, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel,
        to whom you sent me to present your supplication before him:
042:010 If you will still abide in this land, then will I build you,
        and not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you up;
        for I grieve over the distress that I have brought on you.
042:011 Don't be afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom you are afraid;
        don't be afraid of him, says Yahweh:  for I am with you
        to save you, and to deliver you from his hand.
042:012 I will grant you mercy, that he may have mercy on you,
        and cause you to return to your own land.
042:013 But if you say, We will not dwell in this land; so that you
        don't obey the voice of Yahweh your God,
042:014 saying, No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we
        shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet,
        nor have hunger of bread; and there will we dwell:
042:015 now therefore hear you the word of Yahweh, O remnant
        of Judah:  Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, If you
        indeed set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn there;
042:016 then it shall happen, that the sword, which you fear,
        shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt; and the famine,
        about which you are afraid, shall follow hard after you there
        in Egypt; and there you shall die.
042:017 So shall it be with all the men who set their faces to go
        into Egypt to sojourn there:  they shall die by the sword,
        by the famine, and by the pestilence; and none of them shall
        remain or escape from the evil that I will bring on them.
042:018 For thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel:  As my
        anger and my wrath has been poured forth on the inhabitants
        of Jerusalem, so shall my wrath be poured forth on you,
        when you shall enter into Egypt; and you shall be an object
        of horror, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach;
        and you shall see this place no more.
042:019 Yahweh has spoken concerning you, remnant of Judah, Don't you
        go into Egypt:  know certainly that I have testified to
        you this day.
042:020 For you have dealt deceitfully against your own souls;
        for you sent me to Yahweh your God, saying, Pray for us to Yahweh
        our God; and according to all that Yahweh our God shall say,
        so declare to us, and we will do it:
042:021 and I have this day declared it to you; but you have not obeyed
        the voice of Yahweh your God in anything for which he has
        sent me to you.
042:022 Now therefore know certainly that you shall die by the sword,
        by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place where you
        desire to go to sojourn there.
043:001 It happened that, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking
        to all the people all the words of Yahweh their God, with which
        Yahweh their God had sent him to them, even all these words,
043:002 then spoke Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah,
        and all the proud men, saying to Jeremiah, You speak falsely:
        Yahweh our God has not sent you to say, You shall not go
        into Egypt to sojourn there;
043:003 but Baruch the son of Neriah sets you on against us, to deliver us
        into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they may put us to death,
        and carry us away captive to Babylon.
043:004 So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces,
        and all the people, didn't obey the voice of Yahweh,
        to dwell in the land of Judah.
043:005 But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces,
        took all the remnant of Judah, who were returned from
        all the nations where they had been driven, to sojourn
        in the land of Judah;
043:006 the men, and the women, and the children, and the king's daughters,
        and every person who Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard
        had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan;
        and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah;
043:007 and they came into the land of Egypt; for they didn't obey
        the voice of Yahweh:  and they came to Tahpanhes.
043:008 Then came the word of Yahweh to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,
043:009 Take great stones in your hand, and hide them in mortar
        in the brick work, which is at the entry of Pharaoh's house
        in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah;
043:010 and tell them, Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God
        of Israel:  Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadnezzar
        the king of Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne
        on these stones that I have hidden; and he shall spread his
        royal pavilion over them.
043:011 He shall come, and shall strike the land of Egypt;
        such as are for death [shall be given] to death, and such as
        are for captivity to captivity, and such as are for the sword
        to the sword.
043:012 I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt;
        and he shall burn them, and carry them away captive:
        and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt,
        as a shepherd puts on his garment; and he shall go forth
        from there in peace.
043:013 He shall also break the pillars of Beth Shemesh, that is in
        the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of Egypt shall
        he burn with fire.
044:001 The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews who lived
        in the land of Egypt, who lived at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes,
        and at Memphis, and in the country of Pathros, saying,
044:002 Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel:  You have seen
        all the evil that I have brought on Jerusalem, and on all
        the cities of Judah; and behold, this day they are a desolation,
        and no man dwells therein,
044:003 because of their wickedness which they have committed
        to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense,
        [and] to serve other gods, that they didn't know, neither they,
        nor you, nor your fathers.
044:004 However I sent to you all my servants the prophets, rising up
        early and sending them, saying, Oh, don't do this abominable
        thing that I hate.
044:005 But they didn't listen, nor inclined their ear to turn from
        their wickedness, to burn no incense to other gods.
044:006 Therefore my wrath and my anger was poured forth, and was
        kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem;
        and they are wasted and desolate, as it is this day.
044:007 Therefore now thus says Yahweh, the God of Armies, the God
        of Israel:  Why commit you [this] great evil against your own souls,
        to cut off from you man and woman, infant and suckling,
        out of the midst of Judah, to leave you none remaining;
044:008 in that you provoke me to anger with the works of your hands,
        burning incense to other gods in the land of Egypt,
        where you are gone to sojourn; that you may be cut off,
        and that you may be a curse and a reproach among all the nations
        of the earth?
044:009 Have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers,
        and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness
        of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness
        of your wives which they committed in the land of Judah,
        and in the streets of Jerusalem?
044:010 They are not humbled even to this day, neither have they feared,
        nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before
        you and before your fathers.
044:011 Therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God
        of Israel:  Behold, I will set my face against you for evil,
        even to cut off all Judah.
044:012 I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces
        to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they
        shall all be consumed; in the land of Egypt shall they fall;
        they shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine;
        they shall die, from the least even to the greatest, by the sword
        and by the famine; and they shall be an object of horror,
        [and] an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach.
044:013 For I will punish those who dwell in the land of Egypt,
        as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine,
        and by the pestilence;
044:014 so that none of the remnant of Judah, who have gone into
        the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or be left,
        to return into the land of Judah, to which they have a desire
        to return to dwell there:  for none shall return save such
        as shall escape.
044:015 Then all the men who knew that their wives burned incense to
        other gods, and all the women who stood by, a great assembly,
        even all the people who lived in the land of Egypt, in Pathros,
        answered Jeremiah, saying,
044:016 As for the word that you have spoken to us in the name of Yahweh,
        we will not listen to you.
044:017 But we will certainly perform every word that is gone forth
        out of our mouth, to burn incense to the queen of the sky,
        and to pour out drink offerings to her, as we have done,
        we and our fathers, our kings and our princes, in the cities
        of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem; for then had we
        plenty of food, and were well, and saw no evil.
044:018 But since we left off burning incense to the queen of the sky,
        and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have wanted all things,
        and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine.
044:019 When we burned incense to the queen of the sky, and poured out
        drink offerings to her, did we make her cakes to worship her,
        and pour out drink offerings to her, without our husbands?
044:020 Then Jeremiah said to all the people, to the men, and to the women,
        even to all the people who had given him an answer, saying,
044:021 The incense that you burned in the cities of Judah,
        and in the streets of Jerusalem, you and your fathers,
        your kings and your princes, and the people of the land,
        didn't Yahweh remember them, and didn't it come into his mind?
044:022 so that Yahweh could no longer bear, because of the evil
        of your doings, and because of the abominations which you
        have committed; therefore is your land become a desolation,
        and an astonishment, and a curse, without inhabitant,
        as it is this day.
044:023 Because you have burned incense, and because you have sinned
        against Yahweh, and have not obeyed the voice of Yahweh,
        nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies;
        therefore this evil is happened to you, as it is this day.
044:024 Moreover Jeremiah said to all the people, and to all the women,
        Hear the word of Yahweh, all Judah who are in the land of Egypt:
044:025 Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, saying, You and
        your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and with your
        hands have fulfilled it, saying, We will surely perform
        our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen
        of the sky, and to pour out drink offerings to her:
        establish then your vows, and perform your vows.
044:026 Therefore hear the word of Yahweh, all Judah who dwell in
        the land of Egypt:  Behold, I have sworn by my great name,
        says Yahweh, that my name shall no more be named in the mouth
        of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, As the
        Lord Yahweh lives.
044:027 Behold, I watch over them for evil, and not for good;
        and all the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt shall
        be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there
        be an end of them.
044:028 Those who escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt
        into the land of Judah, few in number; and all the remnant
        of Judah, who have gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there,
        shall know whose word shall stand, mine, or theirs.
044:029 This shall be the sign to you, says Yahweh, that I will punish
        you in this place, that you may know that my words shall
        surely stand against you for evil:
044:030 Thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will give Pharaoh Hophra king
        of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of
        those who seek his life; as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into
        the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, who was his enemy,
        and sought his life.
045:001 The message that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch the son
        of Neriah, when he wrote these words in a book at the mouth
        of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah,
        king of Judah, saying,
045:002 Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, to you, Baruch:
045:003 You did say, Woe is me now! for Yahweh has added sorrow to my pain;
        I am weary with my groaning, and I find no rest.
045:004 Thus shall you tell him, Thus says Yahweh:  Behold, that which I
        have built will I break down, and that which I have planted
        I will pluck up; and this in the whole land.
045:005 Seek you great things for yourself?  Don't seek them;
        for, behold, I will bring evil on all flesh, says Yahweh;
        but your life will I give to you for a prey in all places
        where you go.
046:001 The word of Yahweh which came to Jeremiah the prophet
        concerning the nations.
046:002 Of Egypt:  concerning the army of Pharaoh Necoh king
        of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish,
        which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon struck in the fourth
        year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah.
046:003 Prepare you the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle.
046:004 Harness the horses, and get up, you horsemen, and stand forth
        with your helmets; furbish the spears, put on the coats of mail.
046:005 Why have I seen it? they are dismayed and are turned backward;
        and their mighty ones are beaten down, and have fled apace,
        and don't look back:  terror is on every side, says Yahweh.
046:006 Don't let the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape;
        in the north by the river Euphrates have they stumbled and fallen.
046:007 Who is this who rises up like the Nile, whose waters toss
        themselves like the rivers?
046:008 Egypt rises up like the Nile, and his waters toss themselves
        like the rivers:  and he says, I will rise up, I will cover
        the earth; I will destroy cities and the inhabitants of it.
046:009 Go up, you horses; and rage, you chariots; and let the mighty men
        go forth:  Cush and Put, who handle the shield; and the Ludim,
        who handle and bend the bow.
046:010 For that day is [a day] of the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, a day
        of vengeance, that he may avenge him of his adversaries:
        and the sword shall devour and be satiate, and shall drink
        its fill of their blood; for the Lord, Yahweh of Armies,
        has a sacrifice in the north country by the river Euphrates.
046:011 Go up into Gilead, and take balm, virgin daughter of Egypt:
        in vain do you use many medicines; there is no healing for you.
046:012 The nations have heard of your shame, and the earth is full
        of your cry; for the mighty man has stumbled against the mighty,
        they are fallen both of them together.
046:013 The word that Yahweh spoke to Jeremiah the prophet,
        how that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon should come and strike
        the land of Egypt.
046:014 Declare you in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in Memphis
        and in Tahpanhes:  say you, Stand forth, and prepare you;
        for the sword has devoured round about you.
046:015 Why are your strong ones swept away? they didn't stand,
        because Yahweh did drive them.
046:016 He made many to stumble, yes, they fell one on another:
        and they said, Arise, and let us go again to our own people,
        and to the land of our birth, from the oppressing sword.
046:017 They cried there, Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise;
        he has let the appointed time pass by.
046:018 As I live, says the King, whose name is Yahweh of Armies,
        surely like Tabor among the mountains, and like Carmel by the sea,
        so shall he come.
046:019 You daughter who dwell in Egypt, furnish yourself to go
        into captivity; for Memphis shall become a desolation,
        and shall be burnt up, without inhabitant.
046:020 Egypt is a very beautiful heifer; [but] destruction out of
        the north is come, it is come.
046:021 Also her hired men in the midst of her are like calves of the stall;
        for they also are turned back, they are fled away together,
        they didn't stand:  for the day of their calamity is come
        on them, the time of their visitation.
046:022 The sound of it shall go like the serpent; for they shall march
        with an army, and come against her with axes, as wood cutters.
046:023 They shall cut down her forest, says Yahweh, though it
        can't be searched; because they are more than the locusts,
        and are innumerable.
046:024 The daughter of Egypt shall be disappointed; she shall be
        delivered into the hand of the people of the north.
046:025 Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says:  Behold, I will
        punish Amon of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, with her gods,
        and her kings; even Pharaoh, and those who trust in him:
046:026 and I will deliver them into the hand of those who seek their lives,
        and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and into
        the hand of his servants; and afterwards it shall be inhabited,
        as in the days of old, says Yahweh.
046:027 But don't be afraid you, Jacob my servant, neither be
        dismayed, Israel:  for, behold, I will save you from afar,
        and your seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob
        shall return, and shall be quiet and at ease, and none shall
        make him afraid.
046:028 Don't be afraid you, O Jacob my servant, says Yahweh; for I
        am with you:  for I will make a full end of all the nations
        where I have driven you; but I will not make a full end of you,
        but I will correct you in measure, and will in no way
        leave you unpunished.
047:001 The word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning
        the Philistines, before that Pharaoh struck Gaza.
047:002 Thus says Yahweh:  Behold, waters rise up out of the north,
        and shall become an overflowing stream, and shall overflow
        the land and all that is therein, the city and those who
        dwell therein; and the men shall cry, and all the inhabitants
        of the land shall wail.
047:003 At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong ones,
        at the rushing of his chariots, at the rumbling of his wheels,
        the fathers don't look back to their children for
        feebleness of hands;
047:004 because of the day that comes to destroy all the Philistines,
        to cut off from Tyre and Sidon every helper who remains:
        for Yahweh will destroy the Philistines, the remnant of
        the isle of Caphtor.
047:005 Baldness is come on Gaza; Ashkelon is brought to nothing,
        the remnant of their valley:  how long will you cut yourself?
047:006 You sword of Yahweh, how long will it be before you be quiet?
        put up yourself into your scabbard; rest, and be still.
047:007 How can you be quiet, seeing Yahweh has given you a charge?
        Against Ashkelon, and against the seashore, there has
        he appointed it.
048:001 Of Moab.  Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel:  Woe to
        Nebo! for it is laid waste; Kiriathaim is disappointed,
        it is taken; Misgab is put to shame and broken down.
048:002 The praise of Moab is no more; in Heshbon they have devised
        evil against her:  Come, and let us cut her off from being
        a nation.  You also, Madmen, shall be brought to silence:
        the sword shall pursue you.
048:003 The sound of a cry from Horonaim, desolation and great destruction!
048:004 Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.
048:005 For by the ascent of Luhith with continual weeping shall they go up;
        for at the descent of Horonaim they have heard the distress
        of the cry of destruction.
048:006 Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness.
048:007 For, because you have trusted in your works and in your treasures,
        you also shall be taken:  and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity,
        his priests and his princes together.
048:008 The destroyer shall come on every city, and no city shall escape;
        the valley also shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed;
        as Yahweh has spoken.
048:009 Give wings to Moab, that she may fly and get her away:
        and her cities shall become a desolation, without any
        to dwell therein.
048:010 Cursed be he who does the work of Yahweh negligently;
        and cursed be he who keeps back his sword from blood.
048:011 Moab has been at ease from his youth, and he has settled
        on his lees, and has not been emptied from vessel to vessel,
        neither has he gone into captivity:  therefore his taste
        remains in him, and his scent is not changed.
048:012 Therefore, behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will send
        to him those who pour off, and they shall pour him off; and they
        shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles in pieces.
048:013 Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was
        ashamed of Bethel their confidence.
048:014 How say you, We are mighty men, and valiant men for the war?
048:015 Moab is laid waste, and they are gone up into his cities,
        and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter,
        says the King, whose name is Yahweh of Armies.
048:016 The calamity of Moab is near to come, and his affliction
        hurries fast.
048:017 All you who are round about him, bemoan him, and all you
        who know his name; say, How is the strong staff broken,
        the beautiful rod!
048:018 You daughter who dwells in Dibon, come down from your glory,
        and sit in thirst; for the destroyer of Moab is come up
        against you, he has destroyed your strongholds.
048:019 Inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and watch:
        ask him who flees, and her who escapes; say, What has been done?
048:020 Moab is disappointed; for it is broken down:  wail and cry;
        tell you it by the Arnon, that Moab is laid waste.
048:021 Judgment is come on the plain country, on Holon, and on Jahzah,
        and on Mephaath,
048:022 and on Dibon, and on Nebo, and on Beth Diblathaim,
048:023 and on Kiriathaim, and on Beth Gamul, and on Beth Meon,
048:024 and on Kerioth, and on Bozrah, and on all the cities of the land
        of Moab, far or near.
048:025 The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, says Yahweh.
048:026 Make you him drunken; for he magnified himself against Yahweh:
        and Moab shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall
        be in derision.
048:027 For wasn't Israel a derision to you? was he found among thieves?
        for as often as you speak of him, you wag the head.
048:028 You inhabitants of Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock;
        and be like the dove that makes her nest over the mouth
        of the abyss.
048:029 We have heard of the pride of Moab, [that] he is very proud;
        his loftiness, and his pride, and his arrogance, and the
        haughtiness of his heart.
048:030 I know his wrath, says Yahweh, that it is nothing; his boastings
        have worked nothing.
048:031 Therefore will I wail for Moab; yes, I will cry out for all Moab:
        for the men of Kir Heres shall they mourn.
048:032 With more than the weeping of Jazer will I weep for you,
        vine of Sibmah:  your branches passed over the sea,
        they reached even to the sea of Jazer:  on your summer fruits
        and on your vintage the destroyer is fallen.
048:033 Gladness and joy is taken away from the fruitful field
        and from the land of Moab; and I have caused wine to cease
        from the wine presses:  none shall tread with shouting;
        the shouting shall be no shouting.
048:034 From the cry of Heshbon even to Elealeh, even to Jahaz
        have they uttered their voice, from Zoar even to Horonaim,
        to Eglath Shelishiyah:  for the waters of Nimrim also
        shall become desolate.
048:035 Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, says Yahweh,
        him who offers in the high place, and him who burns incense
        to his gods.
048:036 Therefore my heart sounds for Moab like pipes, and my
        heart sounds like pipes for the men of Kir Heres:
        therefore the abundance that he has gotten is perished.
048:037 For every head is bald, and every beard clipped:
        on all the hands are cuttings, and on the waist sackcloth.
048:038 On all the housetops of Moab and in the streets of it there is
        lamentation every where; for I have broken Moab like a vessel
        in which none delights, says Yahweh.
048:039 How is it broken down! [how] do they wail! how has Moab
        turned the back with shame! so shall Moab become a derision
        and a terror to all who are round about him.
048:040 For thus says Yahweh:  Behold, he shall fly as an eagle,
        and shall spread out his wings against Moab.
048:041 Kerioth is taken, and the strongholds are seized, and the heart
        of the mighty men of Moab at that day shall be as the heart
        of a woman in her pangs.
048:042 Moab shall be destroyed from being a people, because he has
        magnified himself against Yahweh.
048:043 Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are on you, inhabitant
        of Moab, says Yahweh.
048:044 He who flees from the fear shall fall into the pit;
        and he who gets up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare:
        for I will bring on him, even on Moab, the year of
        their visitation, says Yahweh.
048:045 Those who fled stand without strength under the shadow of Heshbon;
        for a fire is gone forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from
        the midst of Sihon, and has devoured the corner of Moab,
        and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.
048:046 Woe to you, O Moab! the people of Chemosh is undone; for your sons
        are taken away captive, and your daughters into captivity.
048:047 Yet will I bring back the captivity of Moab in the latter days,
        says Yahweh.  Thus far is the judgment of Moab.
049:001 Of the children of Ammon.  Thus says Yahweh:  Has Israel
        no sons? has he no heir? why then does Malcam possess Gad,
        and his people well in the cities of it?
049:002 Therefore, behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will cause
        an alarm of war to be heard against Rabbah of the children of Ammon;
        and it shall become a desolate heap, and her daughters shall
        be burned with fire:  then shall Israel possess those who did
        possess him, says Yahweh.
049:003 Wail, Heshbon, for Ai is laid waste; cry, you daughters of Rabbah,
        gird you with sackcloth:  lament, and run back and forth
        among the fences; for Malcam shall go into captivity,
        his priests and his princes together.
049:004 Why glory you in the valleys, your flowing valley, backsliding
        daughter? who trusted in her treasures, [saying], Who shall
        come to me?
049:005 Behold, I will bring a fear on you, says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies,
        from all who are round about you; and you shall be driven
        out every man right forth, and there shall be none to gather
        together the fugitives.
049:006 But afterward I will bring back the captivity of the children
        of Ammon, says Yahweh.
049:007 Of Edom.  Thus says Yahweh of Armies:  Is wisdom no more in Teman?
        is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished?
049:008 Flee you, turn back, dwell in the depths, inhabitants of Dedan;
        for I will bring the calamity of Esau on him, the time that I
        shall visit him.
049:009 If grape gatherers came to you, would they not leave some
        gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, wouldn't they destroy
        until they had enough?
049:010 But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places,
        and he shall not be able to hide himself:  his seed is destroyed,
        and his brothers, and his neighbors; and he is no more.
049:011 Leave your fatherless children, I will preserve them alive;
        and let your widows trust in me.
049:012 For thus says Yahweh:  Behold, they to whom it didn't pertain
        to drink of the cup shall certainly drink; and are you he who
        shall altogether go unpunished? you shall not go unpunished,
        but you shall surely drink.
049:013 For I have sworn by myself, says Yahweh, that Bozrah shall
        become an astonishment, a reproach, a waste, and a curse;
        and all the cities of it shall be perpetual wastes.
049:014 I have heard news from Yahweh, and an ambassador is sent
        among the nations, [saying], Gather yourselves together,
        and come against her, and rise up to the battle.
049:015 For, behold, I have made you small among the nations,
        and despised among men.
049:016 As for your terror, the pride of your heart has deceived you,
        O you who dwell in the clefts of the rock, who hold the height
        of the hill:  though you should make your nest as high
        as the eagle, I will bring you down from there, says Yahweh.
049:017 Edom shall become an astonishment:  everyone who passes by it
        shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues of it.
049:018 As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbor
        cities of it, says Yahweh, no man shall dwell there,
        neither shall any son of man sojourn therein.
049:019 Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the pride of the Jordan
        against the strong habitation:  for I will suddenly make them run
        away from it; and whoever is chosen, him will I appoint over it:
        for who is like me? and who will appoint me a time? and who is
        the shepherd who will stand before me?
049:020 Therefore hear the counsel of Yahweh, that he has taken
        against Edom; and his purposes, that he has purposed against
        the inhabitants of Teman:  Surely they shall drag them away,
        [even] the little ones of the flock; surely he shall make
        their habitation desolate over them.
049:021 The earth trembles at the noise of their fall; there is a cry,
        the noise which is heard in the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds}.
049:022 Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread
        out his wings against Bozrah:  and the heart of the mighty
        men of Edom at that day shall be as the heart of a woman
        in her pangs.
049:023 Of Damascus.  Hamath is confounded, and Arpad; for they have heard
        evil news, they are melted away:  there is sorrow on the sea;
        it can't be quiet.
049:024 Damascus has grown feeble, she turns herself to flee,
        and trembling has seized on her:  anguish and sorrows have
        taken hold of her, as of a woman in travail.
049:025 How is the city of praise not forsaken, the city of my joy?
049:026 Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all
        the men of war shall be brought to silence in that day,
        says Yahweh of Armies.
049:027 I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall
        devour the palaces of Ben Hadad.
049:028 Of Kedar, and of the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadnezzar
        king of Babylon struck.  Thus says Yahweh:  Arise you,
        go up to Kedar, and destroy the children of the east.
049:029 Their tents and their flocks shall they take; they shall carry
        away for themselves their curtains, and all their vessels,
        and their camels; and they shall cry to them, Terror on every side!
049:030 Flee you, wander far off, dwell in the depths, you inhabitants
        of Hazor, says Yahweh; for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has taken
        counsel against you, and has conceived a purpose against you.
049:031 Arise, go up to a nation that is at ease, that dwells
        without care, says Yahweh; that have neither gates nor bars,
        that dwell alone.
049:032 Their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their
        livestock a spoil:  and I will scatter to all winds those who
        have the corners [of their hair] cut off; and I will bring
        their calamity from every side of them, says Yahweh.
049:033 Hazor shall be a dwelling place of jackals, a desolation forever:
        no man shall dwell there, neither shall any son of
        man sojourn therein.
049:034 The word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam,
        in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying,
049:035 Thus says Yahweh of Armies:  Behold, I will break the bow of Elam,
        the chief of their might.
049:036 On Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters
        of the sky, and will scatter them toward all those winds;
        and there shall be no nation where the outcasts of Elam
        shall not come.
049:037 I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies,
        and before those who seek their life; and I will bring evil
        on them, even my fierce anger, says Yahweh; and I will send
        the sword after them, until I have consumed them;
049:038 and I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from there
        king and princes, says Yahweh.
049:039 But it shall happen in the latter days, that I will bring back
        the captivity of Elam, says Yahweh.
050:001 The word that Yahweh spoke concerning Babylon, concerning the land
        of the Chaldeans, by Jeremiah the prophet.
050:002 Declare you among the nations and publish, and set up
        a standard; publish, and don't conceal:  say, Babylon is taken,
        Bel is disappointed, Merodach is dismayed; her images
        are disappointed, her idols are dismayed.
050:003 For out of the north there comes up a nation against her,
        which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein:
        they are fled, they are gone, both man and animal.
050:004 In those days, and in that time, says Yahweh, the children
        of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together;
        they shall go on their way weeping, and shall seek
        Yahweh their God.
050:005 They shall inquire concerning Zion with their faces turned
        toward it, [saying], Come you, and join yourselves to Yahweh
        in an everlasting covenant that shall not be forgotten.
050:006 My people have been lost sheep:  their shepherds have caused
        them to go astray; they have turned them away on the mountains;
        they have gone from mountain to hill; they have forgotten
        their resting place.
050:007 All who found them have devoured them; and their adversaries said,
        We are not guilty, because they have sinned against Yahweh,
        the habitation of righteousness, even Yahweh, the hope
        of their fathers.
050:008 Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land
        of the Chaldeans, and be as the male goats before the flocks.
050:009 For, behold, I will stir up and cause to come up against Babylon
        a company of great nations from the north country; and they
        shall set themselves in array against her; from there she shall
        be taken:  their arrows shall be as of an expert mighty man;
        none shall return in vain.
050:010 Chaldea shall be a prey:  all who prey on her shall
        be satisfied, says Yahweh.
050:011 Because you are glad, because you rejoice, O you who plunder
        my heritage, because you are wanton as a heifer that treads
        out [the grain], and neigh as strong horses;
050:012 your mother shall be utterly disappointed; she who bore you shall
        be confounded:  behold, she shall be the least of the nations,
        a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.
050:013 Because of the wrath of Yahweh she shall not be inhabited,
        but she shall be wholly desolate:  everyone who goes by Babylon
        shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues.
050:014 Set yourselves in array against Babylon round about,
        all you who bend the bow; shoot at her, spare no arrows:
        for she has sinned against Yahweh.
050:015 Shout against her round about:  she has submitted herself;
        her bulwarks are fallen, her walls are thrown down;
        for it is the vengeance of Yahweh:  take vengeance on her;
        as she has done, do to her.
050:016 Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him who handles the sickle
        in the time of harvest:  for fear of the oppressing sword
        they shall turn everyone to his people, and they shall flee
        everyone to his own land.
050:017 Israel is a hunted sheep; the lions have driven him away:
        first, the king of Assyria devoured him; and now at last
        Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has broken his bones.
050:018 Therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel:  Behold, I
        will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished
        the king of Assyria.
050:019 I will bring Israel again to his pasture, and he shall feed
        on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied on
        the hills of Ephraim and in Gilead.
050:020 In those days, and in that time, says Yahweh, the iniquity
        of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none;
        and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found:
        for I will pardon them whom I leave as a remnant.
050:021 Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and against
        the inhabitants of Pekod:  kill and utterly destroy after them,
        says Yahweh, and do according to all that I have commanded you.
050:022 A sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction.
050:023 How is the hammer of the whole earth cut apart and broken!
        how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!
050:024 I have laid a snare for you, and you are also taken, Babylon,
        and you weren't aware:  you are found, and also caught,
        because you have striven against Yahweh.
050:025 Yahweh has opened his armory, and has brought forth the weapons
        of his indignation; for the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, has a work
        [to do] in the land of the Chaldeans.
050:026 Come against her from the utmost border; open her storehouses;
        cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly; let nothing
        of her be left.
050:027 Kill all her bulls; let them go down to the slaughter:
        woe to them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation.
050:028 The voice of those who flee and escape out of the land
        of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of Yahweh our God,
        the vengeance of his temple.
050:029 Call together the archers against Babylon, all those who bend
        the bow; encamp against her round about; let none of it escape:
        recompense her according to her work; according to all that she
        has done, do to her; for she has been proud against Yahweh,
        against the Holy One of Israel.
050:030 Therefore shall her young men fall in her streets, and all her men
        of war shall be brought to silence in that day, says Yahweh.
050:031 Behold, I am against you, you proud one, says the Lord, Yahweh
        of Armies; for your day is come, the time that I will visit you.
050:032 The proud one shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up;
        and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour
        all who are round about him.
050:033 Thus says Yahweh of Armies:  The children of Israel and the
        children of Judah are oppressed together; and all who took
        them captive hold them fast; they refuse to let them go.
050:034 Their Redeemer is strong; Yahweh of Armies is his name:
        he will thoroughly plead their cause, that he may give rest
        to the earth, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.
050:035 A sword is on the Chaldeans, says Yahweh, and on the inhabitants
        of Babylon, and on her princes, and on her wise men.
050:036 A sword is on the boasters, and they shall become fools;
        a sword is on her mighty men, and they shall be dismayed.
050:037 A sword is on their horses, and on their chariots,
        and on all the mixed people who are in the midst of her;
        and they shall become as women:  a sword is on her treasures,
        and they shall be robbed.
050:038 A drought is on her waters, and they shall be dried up;
        for it is a land of engraved images, and they are mad over idols.
050:039 Therefore the wild animals of the desert with the wolves
        shall dwell there, and the ostriches shall dwell therein:
        and it shall be no more inhabited forever; neither shall it
        be lived in from generation to generation.
050:040 As when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbor
        cities of it, says Yahweh, so shall no man dwell there,
        neither shall any son of man sojourn therein.
050:041 Behold, a people comes from the north; and a great nation
        and many kings shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts
        of the earth.
050:042 They lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy;
        their voice roars like the sea; and they ride on horses,
        everyone set in array, as a man to the battle, against you,
        daughter of Babylon.
050:043 The king of Babylon has heard the news of them, and his hands
        wax feeble:  anguish has taken hold of him, [and] pangs
        as of a woman in travail.
050:044 Behold, [the enemy] shall come up like a lion from
        the pride of the Jordan against the strong habitation:
        for I will suddenly make them run away from it;
        and whoever is chosen, him will I appoint over it:
        for who is like me? and who will appoint me a time? and who is
        the shepherd who can stand before me?
050:045 Therefore hear the counsel of Yahweh, that he has taken
        against Babylon; and his purposes, that he has purposed against
        the land of the Chaldeans:  Surely they shall drag them away,
        [even] the little ones of the flock; surely he shall make
        their habitation desolate over them.
050:046 At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth trembles,
        and the cry is heard among the nations.
051:001 Thus says Yahweh:  Behold, I will raise up against Babylon,
        and against those who dwell in Lebkamai, a destroying wind.
051:002 I will send to Babylon strangers, who shall winnow her;
        and they shall empty her land:  for in the day of trouble
        they shall be against her round about.
051:003 Against [him who] bends let the archer bend his bow,
        and against [him who] lifts himself up in his coat of mail:
        and don't you spare her young men; destroy you utterly
        all her army.
051:004 They shall fall down slain in the land of the Chaldeans,
        and thrust through in her streets.
051:005 For Israel is not forsaken, nor Judah, of his God, of Yahweh
        of Armies; though their land is full of guilt against
        the Holy One of Israel.
051:006 Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and save every man his life;
        don't be cut off in her iniquity:  for it is the time
        of Yahweh's vengeance; he will render to her a recompense.
051:007 Babylon has been a golden cup in Yahweh's hand, who made
        all the earth drunken:  the nations have drunk of her wine;
        therefore the nations are mad.
051:008 Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed:  wail for her;
        take balm for her pain, if so be she may be healed.
051:009 We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed:
        forsake her, and let us go everyone into his own country;
        for her judgment reaches to heaven, and is lifted up even
        to the skies.
051:010 Yahweh has brought forth our righteousness:  come, and let us
        declare in Zion the work of Yahweh our God.
051:011 Make sharp the arrows; hold firm the shields:
        Yahweh has stirred up the spirit of the kings of the Medes;
        because his purpose is against Babylon, to destroy it:
        for it is the vengeance of Yahweh, the vengeance of his temple.
051:012 Set up a standard against the walls of Babylon, make the
        watch strong, set the watchmen, prepare the ambushes;
        for Yahweh has both purposed and done that which he spoke
        concerning the inhabitants of Babylon.
051:013 You who dwell on many waters, abundant in treasures, your end
        is come, the measure of your covetousness.
051:014 Yahweh of Armies has sworn by himself, [saying], Surely I
        will fill you with men, as with the canker worm; and they
        shall lift up a shout against you.
051:015 He has made the earth by his power, he has established the world
        by his wisdom, and by his understanding has he stretched
        out the heavens:
051:016 when he utters his voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens,
        and he causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth;
        he makes lightning for the rain, and brings forth the wind
        out of his treasuries.
051:017 Every man is become brutish [and is] without knowledge;
        every goldsmith is disappointed by his image; for his molten
        image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.
051:018 They are vanity, a work of delusion:  in the time of their
        visitation they shall perish.
051:019 The portion of Jacob is not like these; for he is the former
        of all things; and [Israel] is the tribe of his inheritance:
        Yahweh of Armies is his name.
051:020 You are my battle axe and weapons of war:  and with you will I
        break in pieces the nations; and with you will I destroy kingdoms;
051:021 and with you will I break in pieces the horse and his rider;
051:022 and with you will I break in pieces the chariot and him who
        rides therein; and with you will I break in pieces man and woman;
        and with you will I break in pieces the old man and the youth;
        and with you will I break in pieces the young man and the virgin;
051:023 and with you will I break in pieces the shepherd and his flock;
        and with you will I break in pieces the farmer and his
        yoke [of oxen]; and with you will I break in pieces
        governors and deputies.
051:024 I will render to Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea
        all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight,
        says Yahweh.
051:025 Behold, I am against you, destroying mountain, says Yahweh,
        which destroys all the earth; and I will stretch out my hand
        on you, and roll you down from the rocks, and will make you
        a burnt mountain.
051:026 They shall not take of you a stone for a corner, nor a stone
        for foundations; but you shall be desolate for ever, says Yahweh.
051:027 Set up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among
        the nations, prepare the nations against her, call together
        against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz:
        appoint a marshal against her; cause the horses to come up
        as the rough canker worm.
051:028 Prepare against her the nations, the kings of the Medes,
        the governors of it, and all the deputies of it, and all
        the land of their dominion.
051:029 The land trembles and is in pain; for the purposes of Yahweh
        against Babylon do stand, to make the land of Babylon
        a desolation, without inhabitant.
051:030 The mighty men of Babylon have forborne to fight,
        they remain in their strongholds; their might has failed;
        they are become as women:  her dwelling places are set on fire;
        her bars are broken.
051:031 One runner will run to meet another, and one messenger
        to meet another, to show the king of Babylon that his city
        is taken on every quarter:
051:032 and the passages are seized, and the reeds they have burned
        with fire, and the men of war are frightened.
051:033 For thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel:  The daughter
        of Babylon is like a threshing floor at the time when it
        is trodden; yet a little while, and the time of harvest shall
        come for her.
051:034 Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon has devoured me, he has
        crushed me, he has made me an empty vessel, he has, like a monster,
        swallowed me up, he has filled his maw with my delicacies;
        he has cast me out.
051:035 The violence done to me and to my flesh be on Babylon,
        shall the inhabitant of Zion say; and, My blood be on
        the inhabitants of Chaldea, shall Jerusalem say.
051:036 Therefore thus says Yahweh:  Behold, I will plead your cause,
        and take vengeance for you; and I will dry up her sea,
        and make her fountain dry.
051:037 Babylon shall become heaps, a dwelling place for jackals,
        an astonishment, and a hissing, without inhabitant.
051:038 They shall roar together like young lions; they shall growl
        as lions' cubs.
051:039 When they are heated, I will make their feast, and I will make
        them drunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep,
        and not wake, says Yahweh.
051:040 I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams
        with male goats.
051:041 How is Sheshach taken! and the praise of the whole earth seized!
        how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!
051:042 The sea is come up on Babylon; she is covered with the multitude
        of the waves of it.
051:043 Her cities are become a desolation, a dry land, and a desert,
        a land in which no man dwells, neither does any son of
        man pass thereby.
051:044 I will execute judgment on Bel in Babylon, and I will bring
        forth out of his mouth that which he has swallowed up;
        and the nations shall not flow any more to him:  yes, the wall
        of Babylon shall fall.
051:045 My people, go you out of the midst of her, and save yourselves
        every man from the fierce anger of Yahweh.
051:046 Don't let your heart faint, neither fear for the news that
        shall be heard in the land; for news shall come one year,
        and after that in another year [shall come] news, and violence
        in the land, ruler against ruler.
051:047 Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will execute judgment
        on the engraved images of Babylon; and her whole land shall
        be confounded; and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.
051:048 Then the heavens and the earth, and all that is therein,
        shall sing for joy over Babylon; for the destroyers shall
        come to her from the north, says Yahweh.
051:049 As Babylon has caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon
        shall fall the slain of all the land.
051:050 You who have escaped the sword, go you, don't stand still;
        remember Yahweh from afar, and let Jerusalem come into your mind.
051:051 We are confounded, because we have heard reproach; confusion has
        covered our faces:  for strangers are come into the sanctuaries
        of Yahweh's house.
051:052 Therefore, behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will
        execute judgment on her engraved images; and through all her
        land the wounded shall groan.
051:053 Though Babylon should mount up to the sky, and though she
        should fortify the height of her strength, yet from me shall
        destroyers come to her, says Yahweh.
051:054 The sound of a cry from Babylon, and of great destruction
        from the land of the Chaldeans!
051:055 For Yahweh lays Babylon waste, and destroys out of her
        the great voice; and their waves roar like many waters;
        the noise of their voice is uttered:
051:056 for the destroyer is come on her, even on Babylon, and her
        mighty men are taken, their bows are broken in pieces;
        for Yahweh is a God of recompenses, he will surely requite.
051:057 I will make drunk her princes and her wise men, her governors
        and her deputies, and her mighty men; and they shall sleep
        a perpetual sleep, and not wake up, says the King, whose name
        is Yahweh of Armies.
051:058 Thus says Yahweh of Armies:  The broad walls of Babylon
        shall be utterly overthrown, and her high gates shall be
        burned with fire; and the peoples shall labor for vanity,
        and the nations for the fire; and they shall be weary.
051:059 The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son
        of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, when he went with Zedekiah
        the king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign.
        Now Seraiah was chief quartermaster.
051:060 Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come on Babylon,
        even all these words that are written concerning Babylon.
051:061 Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When you come to Babylon, then see
        that you read all these words,
051:062 and say, Yahweh, you have spoken concerning this place, to cut
        it off, that none shall dwell therein, neither man nor animal,
        but that it shall be desolate forever.
051:063 It shall be, when you have made an end of reading this book,
        that you shall bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst
        of the Euphrates:
051:064 and you shall say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not
        rise again because of the evil that I will bring on her;
        and they shall be weary.  Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.
052:001 Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign;
        and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem:  and his mother's
        name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
052:002 He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, according to
        all that Jehoiakim had done.
052:003 For through the anger of Yahweh did it happen in Jerusalem
        and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence.
        Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
052:004 It happened in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month,
        in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king
        of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem,
        and encamped against it; and they built forts against
        it round about.
052:005 So the city was besieged to the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.
052:006 In the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine
        was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people
        of the land.
052:007 Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled,
        and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate
        between the two walls, which was by the king's garden;
        (now the Chaldeans were against the city round about;)
        and they went toward the Arabah.
052:008 But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king,
        and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his
        army was scattered from him.
052:009 Then they took the king, and carried him up to the king
        of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; and he gave
        judgment on him.
052:010 The king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes:
        he killed also all the princes of Judah in Riblah.
052:011 He put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon
        bound him in fetters, and carried him to Babylon, and put
        him in prison until the day of his death.
052:012 Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month,
        which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar,
        king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard,
        who stood before the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem:
052:013 and he burned the house of Yahweh, and the king's house;
        and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every great house,
        burned he with fire.
052:014 All the army of the Chaldeans, who were with the captain of
        the guard, broke down all the walls of Jerusalem round about.
052:015 Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive
        of the poorest of the people, and the residue of the people
        who were left in the city, and those who fell away, who fell
        to the king of Babylon, and the residue of the multitude.
052:016 But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poorest
        of the land to be vineyard keepers and farmers.
052:017 The pillars of brass that were in the house of Yahweh,
        and the bases and the bronze sea that were in the house of Yahweh,
        did the Chaldeans break in pieces, and carried all the brass
        of them to Babylon.
052:018 The pots also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the basins,
        and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass with which
        they ministered, took they away.
052:019 The cups, and the fire pans, and the basins, and the pots,
        and the lampstands, and the spoons, and the bowls--
        that which was of gold, in gold, and that which was of silver,
        in silver,--the captain of the guard took away.
052:020 The two pillars, the one sea, and the twelve bronze bulls
        that were under the bases, which king Solomon had made
        for the house of Yahweh.  The brass of all these vessels
        was without weight.
052:021 As for the pillars, the height of the one pillar was
        eighteen cubits; and a line of twelve cubits did compass it;
        and the thickness of it was four fingers:  it was hollow.
052:022 A capital of brass was on it; and the height of the one capital
        was five cubits, with network and pomegranates on the capital
        round about, all of brass:  and the second pillar also had
        like these, and pomegranates.
052:023 There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides; all the
        pomegranates were one hundred on the network round about.
052:024 The captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest,
        and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers
        of the threshold:
052:025 and out of the city he took an officer who was set over the men
        of war; and seven men of those who saw the king's face,
        who were found in the city; and the scribe of the captain
        of the army, who mustered the people of the land; and sixty
        men of the people of the land, who were found in the midst
        of the city.
052:026 Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought
        them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.
052:027 The king of Babylon struck them, and put them to death at Riblah
        in the land of Hamath.  So Judah was carried away captive
        out of his land.
052:028 This is the people whom Nebuchadnezzar carried away captive:
        in the seventh year three thousand twenty-three Jews;
052:029 in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar he carried away
        captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty-two persons;
052:030 in the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuzaradan
        the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews
        seven hundred forty-five persons:  all the persons were four
        thousand and six hundred.
052:031 It happened in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity
        of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month,
        in the five and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach
        king of Babylon, in the [first] year of his reign, lifted up
        the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth
        out of prison;
052:032 and he spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne
        of the kings who were with him in Babylon,
052:033 and changed his prison garments.  [Jehoiachin] ate bread
        before him continually all the days of his life:
052:034 and for his allowance, there was a continual allowance given
        him by the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day
        of his death, all the days of his life.

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
