Book 22 Song of Solomon
001:001 The Song of songs, which is Solomon's. Beloved
001:002 Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth; for your love
        is better than wine.
001:003 Your oils have a pleasing fragrance.  Your name is oil poured forth,
        therefore the virgins love you.
001:004 Take me away with you.  Let us hurry.  The king has brought me
        into his chambers.  Friends We will be glad and rejoice in you.
        We will praise your love more than wine!  Beloved They are
        right to love you.
001:005 I am dark, but lovely, you daughters of Jerusalem,
        like Kedar's tents, like Solomon's curtains.
001:006 Don't stare at me because I am dark, because the sun has scorched me.
        My mother's sons were angry with me.  They made me keeper
        of the vineyards.  I haven't kept my own vineyard.
001:007 Tell me, you whom my soul loves, where you graze your flock,
        where you rest them at noon; For why should I be as one who is
        veiled beside the flocks of your companions?  Lover
001:008 If you don't know, most beautiful among women, follow the tracks
        of the sheep.  Graze your young goats beside the shepherds' tents.
001:009 I have compared you, my love, to a steed in Pharaoh's chariots.
001:010 Your cheeks are beautiful with earrings, your neck with
        strings of jewels.
001:011 We will make you earrings of gold, with studs of silver.
        Beloved
001:012 While the king sat at his table, my perfume spread its fragrance.
001:013 My beloved is to me a sachet of myrrh, that lies between my breasts.
001:014 My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossoms from the vineyards
        of En Gedi.  Lover
001:015 Behold, you are beautiful, my love.  Behold, you are beautiful.
        Your eyes are doves.  Beloved
001:016 Behold, you are beautiful, my beloved, yes, pleasant; and our
        couch is verdant.  Lover
001:017 The beams of our house are cedars.  Our rafters are firs.
        Beloved
002:001 I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys.  Lover
002:002 As a lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.
        Beloved
002:003 As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved
        among the sons.  I sat down under his shadow with great delight,
        his fruit was sweet to my taste.
002:004 He brought me to the banquet hall.  His banner over me is love.
002:005 Strengthen me with raisins, refresh me with apples; For I am
        faint with love.
002:006 His left hand is under my head.  His right hand embraces me.
002:007 I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, or by
        the hinds of the field, that you not stir up, nor awaken love,
        until it so desires.
002:008 The voice of my beloved!  Behold, he comes, leaping on the mountains,
        skipping on the hills.
002:009 My beloved is like a roe or a young hart.  Behold, he stands
        behind our wall!  He looks in at the windows.  He glances
        through the lattice.
002:010 My beloved spoke, and said to me, "Rise up, my love,
        my beautiful one, and come away.
002:011 For, behold, the winter is past.  The rain is over and gone.
002:012 The flowers appear on the earth.  The time of the singing has come,
        and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land.
002:013 The fig tree ripens her green figs.  The vines are in blossom.
        They give forth their fragrance.  Arise, my love, my beautiful one,
        and come away."  Lover
002:014 My dove in the clefts of the rock, In the hiding places of
        the mountainside, Let me see your face.  Let me hear your voice;
        for your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely.
002:015 Catch for us the foxes, the little foxes that spoil the vineyards;
        for our vineyards are in blossom.  Beloved
002:016 My beloved is mine, and I am his.  He browses among the lilies.
002:017 Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved,
        and be like a roe or a young hart on the mountains of Bether.
003:001 By night on my bed, I sought him whom my soul loves.
        I sought him, but I didn't find him.
003:002 I will get up now, and go about the city; in the streets
        and in the squares I will seek him whom my soul loves.
        I sought him, but I didn't find him.
003:003 The watchmen who go about the city found me; "Have you seen
        him whom my soul loves?"
003:004 I had scarcely passed from them, when I found him whom my soul loves.
        I held him, and would not let him go, until I had brought him
        into my mother's house, into the chamber of her who conceived me.
003:005 I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, or by
        the hinds of the field, that you not stir up, nor awaken love,
        until it so desires.
003:006 Who is this who comes up from the wilderness like pillars
        of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all spices
        of the merchant?
003:007 Behold, it is Solomon's carriage!  Sixty mighty men are around it,
        of the mighty men of Israel.
003:008 They all handle the sword, and are expert in war.
        Every man has his sword on his thigh, because of fear
        in the night.
003:009 King Solomon made himself a carriage of the wood of Lebanon.
003:010 He made its pillars of silver, its bottom of gold,
        its seat of purple, its midst being paved with love,
        from the daughters of Jerusalem.
003:011 Go forth, you daughters of Zion, and see king Solomon,
        with the crown with which his mother has crowned him,
        in the day of his weddings, in the day of the gladness
        of his heart.  Lover
004:001 Behold, you are beautiful, my love.  Behold, you are beautiful.
        Your eyes are doves behind your veil.  Your hair is as a flock
        of goats, that descend from Mount Gilead.
004:002 Your teeth are like a newly shorn flock, which have come
        up from the washing, where every one of them has twins.
        None is bereaved among them.
004:003 Your lips are like scarlet thread.  Your mouth is lovely.
        Your temples are like a piece of a pomegranate behind your veil.
004:004 Your neck is like David's tower built for an armory, whereon a
        thousand shields hang, all the shields of the mighty men.
004:005 Your two breasts are like two fawns that are twins of a roe,
        which feed among the lilies.
004:006 Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee away, I will go
        to the mountain of myrrh, to the hill of frankincense.
004:007 You are all beautiful, my love.  There is no spot in you.
004:008 Come with me from Lebanon, my bride, with me from Lebanon.
        Look from the top of Amana, from the top of Senir and Hermon,
        from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards.
004:009 You have ravished my heart, my sister, my bride.
        You have ravished my heart with one of your eyes, with one
        chain of your neck.
004:010 How beautiful is your love, my sister, my bride!
        How much better is your love than wine!  The fragrance of your
        perfumes than all manner of spices!
004:011 Your lips, my bride, drip like the honeycomb.  Honey and milk
        are under your tongue.  The smell of your garments is like
        the smell of Lebanon.
004:012 A locked up garden is my sister, my bride; a locked up spring,
        a sealed fountain.
004:013 Your shoots are an orchard of pomegranates, with precious fruits:
        henna with spikenard plants,
004:014 spikenard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon, with every kind
        of incense tree; myrrh and aloes, with all the best spices,
004:015 a fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, flowing streams
        from Lebanon.  Beloved
004:016 Awake, north wind; and come, you south!  Blow on my garden,
        that its spices may flow out.  Let my beloved come into his garden,
        and taste his precious fruits.  Lover
005:001 I have come into my garden, my sister, my bride.
        I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my
        honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk.
        Friends Eat, friends!  Drink, yes, drink abundantly, beloved.
        Beloved
005:002 I was asleep, but my heart was awake.  It is the voice
        of my beloved who knocks:  "Open to me, my sister, my love,
        my dove, my undefiled; for my head is filled with dew,
        and my hair with the dampness of the night."
005:003 I have taken off my robe.  Indeed, must I put it on?
        I have washed my feet.  Indeed, must I soil them?
005:004 My beloved thrust his hand in through the latch opening.
        My heart pounded for him.
005:005 I rose up to open for my beloved.  My hands dripped with myrrh,
        my fingers with liquid myrrh, on the handles of the lock.
005:006 I opened to my beloved; but my beloved left; and had gone away.
        My heart went out when he spoke.  I looked for him, but I
        didn't find him.  I called him, but he didn't answer.
005:007 The watchmen who go about the city found me.  They beat me.
        They bruised me.  The keepers of the walls took my cloak
        away from me.
005:008 I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, If you find my beloved,
        that you tell him that I am faint with love.  Friends
005:009 How is your beloved better than another beloved, you fairest
        among women?  How is your beloved better than another beloved,
        that you do so adjure us?  Beloved
005:010 My beloved is white and ruddy.  The best among ten thousand.
005:011 His head is like the purest gold.  His hair is bushy,
        black as a raven.
005:012 His eyes are like doves beside the water brooks, washed with milk,
        mounted like jewels.
005:013 His cheeks are like a bed of spices with towers of perfumes.
        His lips are like lilies, dropping liquid myrrh.
005:014 His hands are like rings of gold set with beryl.
        His body is like ivory work overlaid with sapphires.
005:015 His legs are like pillars of marble set on sockets of fine gold.
        His appearance is like Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.
005:016 His mouth is sweetness; yes, he is altogether lovely.
        This is my beloved, and this is my friend, daughters of Jerusalem.
        Friends
006:001 Where has your beloved gone, you fairest among women?
        Where has your beloved turned, that we may seek him with you?
        Beloved
006:002 My beloved has gone down to his garden, to the beds of spices,
        to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.
006:003 I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine.  He browses
        among the lilies,
006:004 You are beautiful, my love, as Tirzah, lovely as Jerusalem,
        awesome as an army with banners.
006:005 Turn away your eyes from me, for they have overcome me.
        Your hair is like a flock of goats, that lie along
        the side of Gilead.
006:006 Your teeth are like a flock of ewes, which have come up
        from the washing; of which every one has twins; none is
        bereaved among them.
006:007 Your temples are like a piece of a pomegranate behind your veil.
006:008 There are sixty queens, eighty concubines, and virgins
        without number.
006:009 My dove, my perfect one, is unique.  She is her mother's
        only daughter.  She is the favorite one of her who bore her.
        The daughters saw her, and called her blessed; the queens
        and the concubines, and they praised her.
006:010 Who is she who looks forth as the morning, beautiful as the moon,
        clear as the sun, and awesome as an army with banners?
006:011 I went down into the nut tree grove, to see the green
        plants of the valley, to see whether the vine budded,
        and the pomegranates were in flower.
006:012 Without realizing it, my desire set me with my royal
        people's chariots.  Friends
006:013 Return, return, Shulammite!  Return, return, that we may gaze
        at you.  Lover Why do you desire to gaze at the Shulammite,
        as at the dance of Mahanaim?
007:001 How beautiful are your feet in sandals, prince's daughter!
        Your rounded thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands
        of a skillful workman.
007:002 Your body is like a round goblet, no mixed wine is wanting.
        Your waist is like a heap of wheat, set about with lilies.
007:003 Your two breasts are like two fawns, that are twins of a roe.
007:004 Your neck is like an ivory tower.  Your eyes are like the pools
        in Heshbon by the gate of Bathrabbim.  Your nose is like
        the tower of Lebanon which looks toward Damascus.
007:005 Your head on you is like Carmel.  The hair of your head like purple.
        The king is held captive in its tresses.
007:006 How beautiful and how pleasant you are, love, for delights!
007:007 This, your stature, is like a palm tree, your breasts
        like its fruit.
007:008 I said, "I will climb up into the palm tree.  I will take hold
        of its fruit."  Let your breasts be like clusters of the vine,
        the smell of your breath like apples, Beloved
007:009 Your mouth like the best wine, that goes down smoothly for
        my beloved, gliding through the lips of those who are asleep.
007:010 I am my beloved's. His desire is toward me.
007:011 Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field.
        Let us lodge in the villages.
007:012 Let's go early up to the vineyards.  Let's see whether the vine
        has budded, its blossom is open, and the pomegranates are in flower.
        There I will give you my love.
007:013 The mandrakes give forth fragrance.  At our doors are all
        kinds of precious fruits, new and old, which I have stored
        up for you, my beloved.
008:001 Oh that you were like my brother, who sucked the breasts
        of my mother!  If I found you outside, I would kiss you;
        yes, and no one would despise me.
008:002 I would lead you, bringing you into my mother's house,
        who would instruct me.  I would have you drink spiced wine,
        of the juice of my pomegranate.
008:003 His left hand would be under my head.  His right hand
        would embrace me.
008:004 I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, that you not stir up,
        nor awaken love, until it so desires.  Friends
008:005 Who is this who comes up from the wilderness, leaning on
        her beloved?  Under the apple tree I aroused you.
        There your mother conceived you.  There she was in labor
        and bore you.
008:006 Set me as a seal on your heart, as a seal on your arm;
        for love is strong as death.  Jealousy is as cruel as Sheol.
        Its flashes are flashes of fire, a very flame of Yahweh.
008:007 Many waters can't quench love, neither can floods drown it.
        If a man would give all the wealth of his house for love,
        he would be utterly scorned.  Friends
008:008 We have a little sister.  She has no breasts.  What shall we
        do for our sister in the day when she is to be spoken for?
008:009 If she is a wall, we will build on her a turret of silver.
        if she is a door, we will enclose her with boards of cedar.
        Beloved
008:010 I am a wall, and my breasts like towers, then I was in his eyes
        like one who found peace.
008:011 Solomon had a vineyard at Baal Hamon.  He leased out the vineyard
        to keepers.  Each was to bring a thousand shekels of silver
        for its fruit.
008:012 My own vineyard is before me.  The thousand are for you, Solomon;
        two hundred for those who tend its fruit.  Lover
008:013 You who dwell in the gardens, with friends in attendance,
        let me hear your voice!  Beloved
008:014 Come away, my beloved!  Be like a gazelle or a young stag
        on the mountains of spices!

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
