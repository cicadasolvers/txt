TO THE GOOD OLD-FASHIONED PEOPLE

     The deadnin' and the thicket's jes' a b'ilin' full o' June,
     From the rattle o' the cricket, to the yaller-hammer's tune;
     And the catbird in the bottom and the sap-suck on the
         snag,
     Seems's ef they cain't--od-rot-'em!--jes' do nothin' else
         but brag!

     There' music in the twitter o' the bluebird and the jay,
     And that sassy little critter jes' a-peckin' all the day;
     There' music in the "flicker," and there' music in the
         thrush,
     And there' music in the snicker o' the chipmunk in the
         brush!--

     There' music all around me!--And I go back--in a dream
     Sweeter yit than ever found me fast asleep:--And, in the
          stream
     That used to split the medder wher' the dandylions
         growed,
     I stand knee-deep, and redder than the sunset down the
         road.

THE ORCHARD LANDS OF LONG AGO


     The orchard lands of Long Ago!
     O drowsy winds, awake, and blow
     The snowy blossoms back to me,
     And all the buds that used to be!
     Blow back along the grassy ways
     Of truant feet, and lift the haze
     Of happy summer from the trees
     That trail their tresses in the seas
     Of grain that float and overflow
     The orchard lands of Long Ago!

     Blow back the melody that slips
     In lazy laughter from the lips
     That marvel much if any kiss
     Is sweeter than the apple's is.
     Blow back the twitter of the birds--
     The lisp, the titter, and the words
     Of merriment that found the shine
     Of summer-time a glorious wine
     That drenched the leaves that loved it so,
     In orchard lands of Long Ago!

     O memory! alight and sing
     Where rosy-bellied pippins cling,
     And golden russets glint and gleam,
     As, in the old Arabian dream,
     The fruits of that enchanted tree
     The glad Aladdin robbed for me!
     And, drowsy winds, awake and fan
     My blood as when it overran
     A heart ripe as the apples grow
     In orchard lands of Long Ago!




WHEN THE FROST IS ON THE PUNKIN


     When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder's in
          the shock,
     And you hear the kyouck and gobble of the struttin'
          turkey-cock,
     And the clackin' of the guineys, and the cluckin' of the
          hens,
     And the rooster's hallylooyer as he tiptoes on the fence;
     O, it's then's the times a feller is a-feelin' at his best,
     With the risin' sun to greet him from a night of peaceful
          rest,
     As he leaves the house, bare-headed, and goes out to feed
          the stock,
     When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder's in the
          shock.

     They's something kindo' harty-like about the atmusfere
     When the heat of summer's over and the coolin' fall is
          here--
     Of course we miss the flowers, and the blossums on the
          trees,
     And the mumble of the hummin'-birds and buzzin' of the
          bees;
     But the air's so appetizin'; and the landscape through the
          haze
     Of a crisp and sunny morning of the airly autumn days
     Is a pictur' that no painter has the colorin' to mock--
     When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder's in the
          shock.

     The husky, rusty russel of the tossels of the corn,
     And the raspin' of the tangled leaves, as golden as the
          morn;
     The stubble in the furries--kindo' lonesome-like, but still
     A-preachin' sermuns to us of the barns they growed to fill;
     The strawstack in the medder, and the reaper in the shed;
     The hosses in theyr stalls below--the clover overhead!--
     O, it sets my hart a-clickin' like the tickin' of a clock,
     When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder's in the
          shock!

     Then your apples all is getherd, and the ones a feller keeps
     Is poured around the cellar-floor in red and yeller heaps;
     And your cider-makin's over, and your wimmern-folks
          is through
     With their mince and apple-butter, and theyr souse and
          saussage, too!...
     I don't know how to tell it--but ef sich a thing could be
     As the Angels wantin' boardin', and they'd call around
          on ME--
     I'd want to 'commodate 'em--all the whole-indurin'
          flock--
     When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder's in the
          shock!




WHEN THE GREEN GITS BACK IN THE TREES


     In Spring, when the green gits back in the trees,
          And the sun comes out and STAYS,
     And yer boots pulls on with a good tight squeeze,
       And you think of yer bare-foot days;
     When you ORT to work and you want to NOT,
       And you and yer wife agrees
     It's time to spade up the garden-lot,
       When the green gits back in the trees
         Well! work is the least o' MY idees
         When the green, you know, gits back in the trees!

     When the green gits back in the trees, and bees
       Is a-buzzin' aroun' ag'in
     In that kind of a lazy go-as-you-please
       Old gait they bum roun' in;
     When the groun's all bald whare the hay-rick stood,
       And the crick's riz, and the breeze
     Coaxes the bloom in the old dogwood,
       And the green gits back in the trees,--
         I like, as I say, in sich scenes as these,
         The time when the green gits back in the trees!

     When the whole tail-feathers o' Wintertime
       Is all pulled out and gone!
     And the sap it thaws and begins to climb,
       And the swet it starts out on
     A feller's forred, a-gittin' down
       At the old spring on his knees--
     I kindo' like jest a-loaferin' roun'
       When the green gits back in the trees--
        Jest a-potterin' roun' as I--durn--please-
        When the green, you know, gits back in the trees!




WET-WEATHER TALK


     It hain't no use to grumble and complane;
       It's jest as cheap and easy to rejoice.--
     When God sorts out the weather and sends rain,
       W'y, rain's my choice.

     Men ginerly, to all intents--
       Although they're apt to grumble some--
     Puts most theyr trust in Providence,
       And takes things as they come--
         That is, the commonality
         Of men that's lived as long as me
         Has watched the world enugh to learn
         They're not the boss of this concern.

     With SOME, of course, it's different--
       I've saw YOUNG men that knowed it all,
     And didn't like the way things went
       On this terrestchul ball;--
         But all the same, the rain, some way,
         Rained jest as hard on picnic day;
         Er, when they railly WANTED it,
         It mayby wouldn't rain a bit!

     In this existunce, dry and wet
       Will overtake the best of men--
     Some little skift o' clouds'll shet
       The sun off now and then.--
         And mayby, whilse you're wundern who
         You've fool-like lent your umbrell' to,
         And WANT it--out'll pop the sun,
         And you'll be glad you hain't got none!

     It aggervates the farmers, too--
        They's too much wet, er too much sun,
     Er work, er waitin' round to do
        Before the plowin' 's done:
          And mayby, like as not, the wheat,
          Jest as it's lookin' hard to beat,
         Will ketch the storm--and jest about
         The time the corn's a-jintin' out.

     These-here CY-CLONES a-foolin' round--
       And back'ard crops!--and wind and rain!--
     And yit the corn that's wallerd down
       May elbow up again!--
         They hain't no sense, as I can see,
         Fer mortuls, sich as us, to be
         A-faultin' Natchur's wise intents,
         And lockin' horns with Providence!

     It hain't no use to grumble and complane;
       It's jest as cheap and easy to rejoice.--
     When God sorts out the weather and sends rain,
       W'y, rain's my choice.




THE BROOK-SONG


            Little brook! Little brook!
            You have such a happy look--
     Such a very merry manner, as you swerve and
               curve and crook--
          And your ripples, one and one,
          Reach each other's hands and run
            Like laughing little children in the sun!

           Little brook, sing to me:
           Sing about a bumblebee
     That tumbled from a lily-bell and grumbled
                 mumblingly,
           Because he wet the film
           Of his wings, and had to swim,
             While the water-bugs raced round and
                 laughed at him!

           Little brook-sing a song
           Of a leaf that sailed along
     Down the golden-braided centre of your current
               swift and strong,
          And a dragon-fly that lit
          On the tilting rim of it,
            And rode away and wasn't scared a bit.

          And sing--how oft in glee
          Came a truant boy like me,
     Who loved to lean and listen to your lilting
                 melody,
          Till the gurgle and refrain
          Of your music in his brain
            Wrought a happiness as keen to him
               as pain.

            Little brook-laugh and leap!
            Do not let the dreamer weep:
     Sing him all the songs of summer till he sink in
                   softest sleep;
            And then sing soft and low
            Through his dreams of long ago--
              Sing back to him the rest he used to
                  know!




THOUGHTS FER THE DISCURAGED FARMER


     The summer winds is sniffin' round the bloomin'
          locus' trees;
     And the clover in the pastur is a big day fer the bees,
     And they been a-swiggin' honey, above board and on the
           sly,
     Tel they stutter in theyr buzzin' and stagger as they fly.
     The flicker on the fence-rail 'pears to jest spit on his
           wings
     And roll up his feathers, by the sassy way he sings;
     And the hoss-fly is a-whettin'-up his forelegs fer biz,
     And the off-mare is a-switchin' all of her tale they is.

     You can hear the blackbirds jawin' as they foller up the
           plow--
     Oh, theyr bound to git theyr brekfast, and theyr not
           a-carin' how;
     So they quarrel in the furries, and they quarrel on the
           wing--
     But theyr peaceabler in pot-pies than any other thing:
     And it's when I git my shotgun drawed up in stiddy rest,
     She's as full of tribbelation as a yeller-jacket's nest;
     And a few shots before dinner, when the sun's a-shinin'
           right,
     Seems to kindo'-sorto' sharpen up a feller's appetite!

     They's been a heap o' rain, but the sun's out to-day,
     And the clouds of the wet spell is all cleared away,
     And the woods is all the greener, and the grass is greener
           still;
     It may rain again to-morry, but I don't think it will.
     Some says the crops is ruined, and the corn's drownded
           out,
     And propha-sy the wheat will be a failure, without doubt;
     But the kind Providence that has never failed us yet,
     Will be on hands onc't more at the 'leventh hour, I bet!

     Does the medder-lark complane, as he swims high and
           dry
     Through the waves of the wind and the blue of the sky?
     Does the quail set up and whissel in a disappinted way,
     Er hang his head in silunce, and sorrow all the day?
     Is the chipmuck's health a-failin'?--Does he walk, er does
             he run?
     Don't the buzzards ooze around up thare just like they've
             allus done?
     Is they anything the matter with the rooster's lungs er
             voice?
     Ort a mortul be complainin' when dumb animals rejoice?

     Then let us, one and all, be contentud with our lot;
     The June is here this morning, and the sun is shining hot.
     Oh! let us fill our harts up with the glory of the day,
     And banish ev'ry doubt and care and sorrow fur away!
     Whatever be our station, with Providence fer guide,
     Sich fine circumstances ort to make us satisfied;
     Fer the world is full of roses, and the roses full of dew,
     And the dew is full of heavenly love that drips fer me
           and you.




"MYLO JONES'S WIFE"


     "Mylo Jones's wife" was all
     I heerd, mighty near, last Fall--
     Visitun relations down
     T'other side of Morgantown!
     Mylo Jones's wife she does
     This and that, and "those" and "thus"!--
     Can't 'bide babies in her sight--
     Ner no childern, day and night,
     Whoopin' round the premises--
     NER NO NOTHIN' ELSE, I guess!

     Mylo Jones's wife she 'lows
     She's the boss of her own house!--
     Mylo--consequences is--
     Stays whare things seem SOME like HIS,--
     Uses, mostly, with the stock--
     Coaxin' "Old Kate" not to balk,
     Ner kick hoss-flies' branes out, ner
     Act, I s'pose, so much like HER!
     Yit the wimmern-folks tells you
     She's PERFECTION.--Yes they do!

     Mylo's wife she says she's found
     Home hain't home with MEN-FOLKS round
     When they's work like HERN to do--
     Picklin' pears and BUTCHERN, too,
     And a-rendern lard, and then
     Cookin' fer a pack of men
     To come trackin' up the flore
     SHE'S scrubbed TEL she'll scrub no MORE!--
     Yit she'd keep things clean ef they
     Made her scrub tel Jedgmunt Day!

     Mylo Jones's wife she sews
     Carpet-rags and patches clothes
     Jest year IN and OUT!--and yit
     Whare's the livin' use of it?
     She asts Mylo that.--And he
     Gits back whare he'd ruther be,
     With his team;--jest PLOWS--and don't
     Never sware--like some folks won't!
     Think ef HE'D CUT LOOSE, I gum!
     'D he'p his heavenly chances some!

     Mylo's wife don't see no use,
     Ner no reason ner excuse
     Fer his pore relations to
     Hang round like they allus do!
     Thare 'bout onc't a year--and SHE--
     She jest GA'NTS 'em, folks tells me,
     On spiced pears!--Pass Mylo one,
     He says "No, he don't chuse none!"
     Workin'men like Mylo they
     'D ort to have MEAT ev'ry day!

     Dad-burn Mylo Jones's wife!
     Ruther rake a blame caseknife
     'Crost my wizzen than to see
     Sich a womern rulin' ME!--
     Ruther take and turn in and
     Raise a fool mule-colt by hand'

     Jest keeps ca'm--like some folks CAN--
     And 'lows sich as her, I s'pose,
     Is MAN'S HE'PMEET'--Mercy knows!




HOW JOHN QUIT THE FARM


     Nobody on the old farm here but Mother, me and
            John,
     Except, of course, the extry he'p when harvest-time
            comes on,--
     And THEN, I want to say to you, we NEEDED he'p about,
     As you'd admit, ef you'd a-seen the way the crops turned
            out!

     A better quarter-section ner a richer soil warn't found
     Than this-here old-home place o' ourn fer fifty miles
           around!--
     The house was small--but plenty-big we found it from
           the day
     That John--our only livin' son--packed up and went
           away.

     You see, we tuk sich pride in John--his mother more'n
           me--
     That's natchurul; but BOTH of us was proud as proud
           could be;
     Fer the boy, from a little chap, was most oncommon
           bright,
     And seemed in work as well as play to take the same
           delight.

     He allus went a-whistlin' round the place, as glad at heart
     As robins up at five o'clock to git an airly start;
     And many a time 'fore daylight Mother's waked me up
          to say--
     "Jest listen, David!--listen!--Johnny's beat the birds
          to-day!"

     High-sperited from boyhood, with a most inquirin' turn,--
     He wanted to learn ever'thing on earth they was to learn:
     He'd ast more plaguy questions in a mortal-minute here
     Than his grandpap in Paradise could answer in a year!

     And READ! w'y, his own mother learnt him how to read
           and spell;
     And "The Childern of the Abbey"--w'y, he knowed that
           book as well
     At fifteen as his parents!--and "The Pilgrim's
           Progress," too--
     Jest knuckled down, the shaver did, and read 'em through
           and through.

     At eighteen, Mother 'lowed the boy must have a better
           chance-
     That we ort to educate him, under any circumstance;
     And John he j'ined his mother, and they ding-donged and
           kep' on,
     Tel I sent him off to school in town, half glad that he was
           gone.

     But--I missed him--w'y, of course I did!--The Fall and
           Winter through
     I never built the kitchen-fire, er split a stick in two,
     Er fed the stock, er butchered, er swung up a gambrel-pin,
     But what I thought o' John, and wished that he was home
           ag'in.

     He'd come, sometimes--on Sund'ys most--and stay the
           Sund'y out;
     And on Thanksgivin'-Day he 'peared to like to be about:
     But a change was workin' on him--he was stiller than
           before,
     And didn't joke, ner laugh, ner sing and whistle any
           more.

     And his talk was all so proper; and I noticed, with a sigh,
     He was tryin' to raise side-whiskers, and had on a striped
           tie,
     And a standin'-collar, ironed up as stiff and slick as bone;
     And a breast-pin, and a watch and chain and plug-hat of
           his own.

     But when Spring-weather opened out, and John was to
           come home
     And he'p me through the season, I was glad to see him
           come,
     But my happiness, that evening, with the settin' sun went
           down,
     When he bragged of "a position" that was offered him in
           town.

     "But," says I, "you'll not accept it?" "W'y, of course I
            will," says he.--
     "This drudgin' on a farm," he says, "is not the life fer
           me;
     I've set my stakes up higher," he continued, light and
           gay,
     "And town's the place fer ME, and I'm a-goin' right
           away!"

     And go he did!--his mother clingin' to him at the gate,
     A-pleadin' and a-cryin'; but it hadn't any weight.
     I was tranquiller, and told her 'twarn't no use to worry
           so,
     And onclasped her arms from round his neck round mine
           --and let him go!

     I felt a little bitter feelin' foolin' round about
     The aidges of my conscience; but I didn't let it out;--
     I simply retch out, trimbly-like, and tuk the boy's hand,
     And though I didn't say a word, I knowed he'd under-
          stand.

     And--well!--sence then the old home here was mighty
          lonesome, shore!
     With me a-workin' in the field, and Mother at the door,
     Her face ferever to'rds the town, and fadin' more and
           more--
     Her only son nine miles away, a-clerkin' in a store!

     The weeks and months dragged by us; and sometimes the
           boy would write
     A letter to his mother, sayin' that his work was light,
     And not to feel oneasy about his health a bit--
     Though his business was confinin', he was gittin' used
           to it.

     And sometimes he would write and ast how _I_ was gittin'
           on,
     And ef I had to pay out much fer he'p sence he was gone;
     And how the hogs was doin', and the balance of the stock,
     And talk on fer a page er two jest like he used to talk.

     And he wrote, along 'fore harvest, that he guessed he
           would git home,
     Fer business would, of course, be dull in town.--But
           DIDN'T come:--
     We got a postal later, sayin' when they had no trade
     They filled the time "invoicin' goods," and that was why
           he stayed.

     And then he quit a-writin' altogether: Not a word--
     Exceptin' what the neighbers brung who'd been to town
           and heard
     What store John was clerkin' in, and went round to in-
           quire
     If they could buy their goods there less and sell their
           produce higher.

     And so the Summer faded out, and Autumn wore away,
     And a keener Winter never fetched around Thanksgivin'-
           Day!
     The night before that day of thanks I'll never quite fergit,
     The wind a-howlin' round the house-it makes me creepy
           yit!

     And there set me and Mother--me a-twistin' at the
           prongs
     Of a green scrub-ellum forestick with a vicious pair of
           tongs,
     And Mother sayin', "DAVID! DAVID!" in a' undertone,
     As though she thought that I was thinkin' bad-words
     unbeknown.

     "I've dressed the turkey, David, fer to-morrow," Mother
           said,
     A-tryin' to wedge some pleasant subject in my stubborn
           head,--
     "And the mince-meat I'm a-mixin' is perfection mighty
           nigh;
     And the pound-cake is delicious-rich--" "Who'll eat
           'em?" I--says--I.

     "The cramberries is drippin'-sweet," says Mother, runnin'
           on,
     P'tendin' not to hear me;--"and somehow I thought of
           John
     All the time they was a-jellin'--fer you know they allus
           was
     His favorITE--he likes 'em so!" Says I "Well, s'pose
           he does?"

     "Oh, nothin' much!" says Mother, with a quiet sort o'
           smile--
     "This gentleman behind my cheer may tell you after
           while!"
     And as I turnt and looked around, some one riz up and
           leant
     And putt his arms round Mother's neck, and laughed in
           low content.

     "It's ME," he says--"your fool-boy John, come back to
            shake your hand;
     Set down with you, and talk with you, and make you un-
            derstand
     How dearer yit than all the world is this old home that
            we
     Will spend Thanksgivin' in fer life--jest Mother, you
           and me!"

     Nobody on the old farm here but Mother, me and John,
     Except, of course, the extry he'p when harvest-time
           comes on;
     And then, I want to say to you, we NEED sich he'p about,
     As you'd admit, ef you could see the way the crops turn
           out!




A CANARY AT THE FARM


     Folks has be'n to town, and Sahry
     Fetched 'er home a pet canary,--
     And of all the blame', contrary,
         Aggervatin' things alive!
     I love music--that's I love it
     When it's free--and plenty of it;--
     But I kindo' git above it,
         At a dollar-eighty-five!

     Reason's plain as I'm a--sayin',--
     Jes' the idy, now, o' layin'
     Out yer money, and a-payin'
         Fer a wilder-cage and bird,
     When the medder-larks is wingin'
     Round you, and the woods is ringin'
     With the beautifullest singin'
         That a mortal ever heard!

     Sahry's sot, tho'.--So I tell her
     He's a purty little feller,
     With his wings o' creamy-yeller,
         And his eyes keen as a cat;
     And the twitter o' the critter
     Tears to absolutely glitter!
     Guess I'll haf to go and git her
         A high-priceter cage 'n that!




WHERE THE CHILDREN USED TO PLAY


     The old farm-home is Mother's yet and mine,
        And filled it is with plenty and to spare,--
     But we are lonely here in life's decline,
        Though fortune smiles around us everywhere:
             We look across the gold
             Of the harvests, as of old--
        The corn, the fragrant clover, and the hay
             But most we turn our gaze,
             As with eyes of other days,
        To the orchard where the children used to play.

     O from our life's full measure
     And rich hoard of worldly treasure
         We often turn our weary eyes away,
     And hand in hand we wander
     Down the old path winding yonder
        To the orchard where the children used to play

     Our sloping pasture-lands are filled with herds;
        The barn and granary-bins are bulging o'er:
     The grove's a paradise of singing birds-
        The woodland brook leaps laughing by the door
             Yet lonely, lonely still,
             Let us prosper as we will,
        Our old hearts seem so empty everyway--
             We can only through a mist
             See the faces we have kissed
        In the orchard where the children used to play.

     O from our life's full measure
     And rich hoard of worldly treasure
        We often turn our weary eyes away,
     And hand in hand we wander
     Down the old path winding yonder
        To the orchard where the children used to play.




GRIGGSBY'S STATION


     Pap's got his pattent-right, and rich as all creation;
       But where's the peace and comfort that we all had
            before?
     Le's go a-visitin' back to Griggsby's Station--
       Back where we ust to be so happy and so pore!

     The likes of us a-livin' here! It's jest a mortal pity
       To see us in this great big house, with cyarpets on the
            stairs,
     And the pump right in the kitchen! And the city! city!
            city!--
       And nothin' but the city all around us ever'wheres!

     Climb clean above the roof and look from the steeple,
        And never see a robin, nor a beech or ellum tree!
     And right here in ear-shot of at least a thousan' people,
        And none that neighbors with us or we want to go and
             see!

     Le's go a-visitin' back to Griggsby's Station--
        Back where the latch-string's a-hangin' from the door,
     And ever' neighbor round the place is dear as a relation--
        Back where we ust to be so happy and so pore!

     I want to see the Wiggenses, the whole kit-and-bilin',
        A-drivin' up from Shallor Ford to stay the Sunday
             through;
     And I want to see 'em hitchin' at their son-in-law's and
             pilin'
     Out there at 'Lizy Ellen's like they ust to do!

     I want to see the piece-quilts the Jones girls is makin';
        And I want to pester Laury 'bout their freckled hired
           hand,
     And joke her 'bout the widower she come purt' nigh
           a-takin',
     Till her Pap got his pension 'lowed in time to save his
           land.

     Le's go a-visitin' back to Griggsby's Station--
        Back where they's nothin' aggervatin' any more,
     Shet away safe in the woods around the old location--
        Back where we ust to be so happy and so pore!

     I want to see Marindy and he'p her with her sewin',
        And hear her talk so lovin' of her man that's dead and
           gone,
     And stand up with Emanuel to show me how he's
           growin',
        And smile as I have saw her 'fore she putt her mournin'
           on.

     And I want to see the Samples, on the old lower eighty,
        Where John, our oldest boy, he was tuk and burried
           --for
     His own sake and Katy's,--and I want to cry with Katy
        As she reads all his letters over, writ from The War.

     What's in all this grand life and high situation,
        And nary pink nor hollyhawk a-bloomin' at the door?--
     Le's go a-visitin' back to Griggsby's Station--
        Back where we ust to be so happy and so pore!




KNEE-DEEP IN JUNE


     I


     Tell you what I like the best--
        'Long about knee-deep in June,
      'Bout the time strawberries melts
      On the vine,--some afternoon
     Like to jes' git out and rest,
        And not work at nothin' else'


     II


     Orchard's where I'd ruther be--
     Needn't fence it in fer me!--
       Jes' the whole sky overhead,
     And the whole airth underneath--
     Sorto' so's a man kin breathe
       Like he ort, and kindo' has
     Elbow-room to keerlessly
       Sprawl out len'thways on the grass
         Where the shadders thick and soft
       As the kivvers on the bed
         Mother fixes in the loft
     Allus, when they's company!

     Jes' a-sorto' lazin' there--
       S'lazy, 'at you peek and peer
         Through the wavin' leaves above,
         Like a feller 'at's in love
       And don't know it, ner don't keer!
       Ever'thing you hear and see
         Got some sort o' interest--

       Tucked up there conveenently
       Fer the boy 'at's ap' to be

       Where some other's whistle is

     And look up to find the crow--
     Er a hawk,--away up there,
     'Pearantly FROZE in the air!--
       Hear the old hen squawk, and squat
       Over ever' chick she's got,
     Suddent-like!--and she knows where
       That-air hawk is, well as you!--
       You jes' bet yer life she do!--
         Eyes a-glitterin' like glass,

       My opinion, 's second class,
     Yit you'll hear 'em more er less;
         Sapsucks gittin' down to biz,
     Weedin' out the lonesomeness;
       Mr. Bluejay, full o' sass,
         In them base-ball clothes o' his,
     Sportin' round the orchard jes'
     Like he owned the premises!
         Sun out in the fields kin sizz,
     But flat on yer back, I guess,
         In the shade's where glory is!
     That's jes' what I'd like to do

         Under some old apple-tree,
         Jes' a-restin' through and through
       I could git along without
         Nothin' else at all to do

          Tumble round and souse yer head
     In the clover-bloom, er pull
            Yer straw hat acrost yer eyes
            And peek through it at the skies,
         Thinkin' of old chums 'at's dead,
              Maybe, smilin' back at you
     In betwixt the beautiful
             Clouds o' gold and white and blue.
     Month a man kin railly love
     June, you know, I'm talkin' of!

     March ain't never nothin' new!
     Aprile's altogether too
       Brash fer me! and May--I jes'
       'Bominate its promises,
     Little hints o' sunshine and
     Green around the timber-land--
       A few blossoms, and a few
         Chip-birds, and a sprout er two,--
         Drap asleep, and it turns in
         'Fore daylight and SNOWS ag'in!--
     But when JUNE comes--Clear my th'oat
       With wild honey!--Rench my hair
     In the dew! and hold my coat!
         Whoop out loud! and th'ow my hat!--
       June wants me, and I'm to spare!
       Spread them shadders anywhere,

         And obleeged to you at that!




SEPTEMBER DARK


     I


     The air falls chill;
     The whippoorwill
     Pipes lonesomely behind the hill:
     The dusk grows dense,
     The silence tense;
     And lo, the katydids commence.


     II


     Through shadowy rifts
     Of woodland, lifts
     The low, slow moon, and upward drifts,
     While left and right
     The fireflies' light
     Swirls eddying in the skirts of Night.


     III


     O Cloudland, gray
     And level, lay
     Thy mists across the face of Day!
     At foot and head,
     Above the dead,
     O Dews, weep on uncomforted!




THE CLOVER


     Some sings of the lily, and daisy, and rose,
        And the pansies and pinks that the Summertime
               throws
     In the green grassy lap of the medder that lays
     Blinkin' up at the skyes through the sunshiney days;
     But what is the lily and all of the rest
     Of the flowers, to a man with a hart in his brest
     That was dipped brimmin' full of the honey and dew
     Of the sweet clover-blossoms his babyhood knew?
     I never set eyes on a clover-field now,
     Er fool round a stable, er climb in the mow,
     But my childhood comes back jest as clear and as plane
     As the smell of the clover I'm sniffin' again;
     And I wunder away in a bare-footed dream,
     Whare I tangle my toes in the blossoms that gleam
     With the dew of the dawn of the morning of love
     Ere it wept ore the graves that I'm weepin' above.

     And so I love clover--it seems like a part
     Of the sacerdest sorrows and joys of my hart;
     And wharever it blossoms, oh, thare let me bow
     And thank the good God as I'm thankin' Him now;
     And I pray to Him still fer the stren'th when I die,
     To go out in the clover and tell it good-bye,
     And lovin'ly nestle my face in its bloom
     While my soul slips away on a breth of purfume




OLD OCTOBER


     Old October's purt' nigh gone,
     And the frosts is comin' on
     Little HEAVIER every day--
     Like our hearts is thataway!
     Leaves is changin' overhead
     Back from green to gray and red,
     Brown and yeller, with their stems
     Loosenin' on the oaks and e'ms;
     And the balance of the trees
     Gittin' balder every breeze--
     Like the heads we're scratchin' on!
     Old October's purt' nigh gone.

     I love Old October so,
     I can't bear to see her go--
     Seems to me like losin' some
     Old-home relative er chum--
     'Pears like sorto' settin' by
     Some old friend 'at sigh by sigh
     Was a-passin' out o' sight
     Into everlastin' night!
     Hickernuts a feller hears
     Rattlin' down is more like tears
     Drappin' on the leaves below--
     I love Old October so!

     Can't tell what it is about
     Old October knocks me out!--
     I sleep well enough at night--
     And the blamedest appetite
     Ever mortal man possessed,--
     Last thing et, it tastes the best!--
     Warnuts, butternuts, pawpaws,
     'Iles and limbers up my jaws
     Fer raal service, sich as new
     Pork, spareribs, and sausage, too.--
     Yit, fer all, they's somepin' 'bout
     Old October knocks me out!




OLD-FASHIONED ROSES


     They ain't no style about 'em,
       And they're sorto' pale and faded,
     Yit the doorway here, without 'em,
      Would be lonesomer, and shaded
       With a good 'eal blacker shadder
        Than the morning-glories makes,
       And the sunshine would look sadder
        Fer their good old-fashion' sakes,

     I like 'em 'cause they kindo'--
      Sorto' MAKE a feller like 'em!
     And I tell you, when I find a
      Bunch out whur the sun kin strike 'em,
     It allus sets me thinkin'
      O' the ones 'at used to grow
     And peek in thro' the chinkin'
      O' the cabin, don't you know!

     And then I think o' mother,
      And how she ust to love 'em--
     When they wuzn't any other,
      'Less she found 'em up above 'em!
        And her eyes, afore she shut 'em,
         Whispered with a smile and said
        We must pick a bunch and putt 'em
         In her hand when she wuz dead.

     But, as I wuz a-sayin',
      They ain't no style about 'em
     Very gaudy er displaying
      But I wouldn't be without 'em,--
       'Cause I'm happier in these posies,
         And the hollyhawks and sich,
      Than the hummin'-bird 'at noses
         In the roses of the rich.




A COUNTRY PATHWAY


     I come upon it suddenly, alone--
      A little pathway winding in the weeds
     That fringe the roadside; and with dreams my own,
      I wander as it leads.

     Full wistfully along the slender way,
      Through summer tan of freckled shade and shine,
     I take the path that leads me as it may--
      Its every choice is mine.

     A chipmunk, or a sudden-whirring quail,
      Is startled by my step as on I fare--
     A garter-snake across the dusty trail
      Glances and--is not there.

     Above the arching jimson-weeds flare twos
      And twos of sallow-yellow butterflies,
     Like blooms of lorn primroses blowing loose
      When autumn winds arise.

     The trail dips--dwindles--broadens then, and lifts
      Itself astride a cross-road dubiously,
     And, from the fennel marge beyond it, drifts
      Still onward, beckoning me.

     And though it needs must lure me mile on mile
      Out of the public highway, still I go,
     My thoughts, far in advance in Indian-file,
      Allure me even so.

     Why, I am as a long-lost boy that went
      At dusk to bring the cattle to the bars,
     And was not found again, though Heaven lent
      His mother all the stars

     With which to seek him through that awful night.
      O years of nights as vain!--Stars never rise
     But well might miss their glitter in the light
      Of tears in mother-eyes!

     So--on, with quickened breaths, I follow still--
      My avant-courier must be obeyed!
     Thus am I led, and thus the path, at will,
      Invites me to invade

     A meadow's precincts, where my daring guide
      Clambers the steps of an old-fashioned stile,
     And stumbles down again, the other side,
      To gambol there awhile

     In pranks of hide-and-seek, as on ahead
      I see it running, while the clover-stalks
     Shake rosy fists at me, as though they said--
      "You dog our country--walks

     "And mutilate us with your walking-stick!--
       We will not suffer tamely what you do,
     And warn you at your peril,--for we'll sic
       Our bumblebees on you!"

     But I smile back, in airy nonchalance,--
      The more determined on my wayward quest,
     As some bright memory a moment dawns
      A morning in my breast--

     Sending a thrill that hurries me along
      In faulty similes of childish skips,
     Enthused with lithe contortions of a song
      Performing on my lips.

     In wild meanderings o'er pasture wealth--
      Erratic wanderings through dead'ning-lands,
     Where sly old brambles, plucking me by stealth,
      Put berries in my hands:

     Or the path climbs a bowlder--wades a slough--
      Or, rollicking through buttercups and flags,
     Goes gayly dancing o'er a deep bayou
      On old tree-trunks and snags:

     Or, at the creek, leads o'er a limpid pool
      Upon a bridge the stream itself has made,
     With some Spring-freshet for the mighty tool
      That its foundation laid.

     I pause a moment here to bend and muse,
       With dreamy eyes, on my reflection, where
     A boat-backed bug drifts on a helpless cruise,
       Or wildly oars the air,

     As, dimly seen, the pirate of the brook--
       The pike, whose jaunty hulk denotes his speed--
     Swings pivoting about, with wary look
       Of low and cunning greed.

     Till, filled with other thought, I turn again
       To where the pathway enters in a realm
     Of lordly woodland, under sovereign reign
       Of towering oak and elm.

     A puritanic quiet here reviles
       The almost whispered warble from the hedge.
     And takes a locust's rasping voice and files
       The silence to an edge.

     In such a solitude my sombre way
       Strays like a misanthrope within a gloom
     Of his own shadows--till the perfect day
       Bursts into sudden bloom,

     And crowns a long, declining stretch of space,
       Where King Corn's armies lie with flags unfurled.
     And where the valley's dint in Nature's face
       Dimples a smiling world.

     And lo! through mists that may not be dispelled,
       I see an old farm homestead, as in dreams,
     Where, like a gem in costly setting held,
       The old log cabin gleams.

     O darling Pathway! lead me bravely on
       Adown your alley-way, and run before
     Among the roses crowding up the lawn
       And thronging at the door,--

     And carry up the echo there that shall
       Arouse the drowsy dog, that he may bay
     The household out to greet the prodigal
       That wanders home to-day.




WORTERMELON TIME


     Old wortermelon time is a-comin' round again,
        And they ain't no man a-livin' any tickleder'n me,
     Fer the way I hanker after wortermelons is a sin--
        Which is the why and wharefore, as you can plainly see.

     Oh! it's in the sandy soil wortermelons does the best,
        And it's thare they'll lay and waller in the sunshine and
            the dew
     Tel they wear all the green streaks clean off of theyr
            breast;
       And you bet I ain't a-findin' any fault with them; ain't
            you?

     They ain't no better thing in the vegetable line;
       And they don't need much 'tendin', as ev'ry farmer
          knows;
     And when theyr ripe and ready fer to pluck from the vine,
       I want to say to you theyr the best fruit that grows.

     It's some likes the yeller-core, and some likes the red.
       And it's some says "The Little Californy" is the best;
     But the sweetest slice of all I ever wedged in my head,
       Is the old "Edingburg Mounting-sprout," of the west

     You don't want no punkins nigh your wortermelon
          vines--
       'Cause, some-way-another, they'll spile your melons,
          shore;--
     I've seed 'em taste like punkins, from the core to the rines,
        Which may be a fact you have heerd of before

     But your melons that's raised right and 'tended to with
          care,
       You can walk around amongst 'em with a parent's
          pride and joy,
     And thump 'em on the heads with as fatherly a air
       As ef each one of them was your little girl er boy.

     I joy in my hart jest to hear that rippin' sound
       When you split one down the back and jolt the halves
          in two,
     And the friends you love the best is gethered all around--
       And you says unto your sweethart, "Oh, here's the
          core fer you!"

     And I like to slice 'em up in big pieces fer 'em all,
       Espeshally the childern, and watch theyr high delight
     As one by one the rines with theyr pink notches falls,
       And they holler fer some more, with unquenched
          appetite.

     Boys takes to it natchurl, and I like to see 'em eat--
       A slice of wortermelon's like a frenchharp in theyr
          hands,
     And when they "saw" it through theyr mouth sich music
          can't be beat--
       'Cause it's music both the sperit and the stummick
          understands.

     Oh, they's more in wortermelons than the purty-colored
          meat,
       And the overflowin' sweetness of the worter squshed
          betwixt

     The up'ard and the down'ard motions of a feller's teeth,
       And it's the taste of ripe old age and juicy childhood
          mixed.

     Fer I never taste a melon but my thoughts flies away
       To the summertime of youth; and again I see the dawn,
     And the fadin' afternoon of the long summer day,
       And the dusk and dew a-fallin', and the night a-comin'
          on.

     And thare's the corn around us, and the lispin' leaves and
          trees,
     And the stars a-peekin' down on us as still as silver
          mice,
     And us boys in the wortermelons on our hands and knees,
       And the new-moon hangin' ore us like a yeller-cored
          slice.

     Oh! it's wortermelon time is a-comin' round again,
       And they ain't no man a-livin' any tickleder'n me,
     Fer the way I hanker after wortermelons is a sin--
       Which is the why and wharefore, as you can plainly see.




UP AND DOWN OLD BRANDYWINE


     Up and down old Brandywine,
         In the days 'at's past and gone--
     With a dad-burn hook-and line
         And a saplin' pole--swawn!

     Honest, now!--it hain't no DREAM

     In and on betwixt the trees
         'Long the banks, pour down yer noon,

         And the yallerhammer's tune;
             And the smokin', chokin' dust
             O' the turnpike at its wusst--

     Souse me and my new straw-hat
         Off the foot-log!--what _I_ care?--
     Fist shoved in the crown o' that--
         Like the old Clown ust to wear.
             Wouldn't swop it fer a' old
             Gin-u-wine raal crown o' gold!--
             Keep yer KING ef you'll gim me

          My best "goggle-eye!"--but you
     Can't lay hands on joys I feel
          Nibblin' like they ust to do!
              So, in memory, to-day
              Same old ripple lips away
              At my "cork" and saggin' line,
              Up and down old Bradywine!

     There the logs is, round the hill,
         Where "Old Irvin" ust to lift
     Out sunfish from daylight till
         Dewfall--'fore he'd leave "The Drift"
              And give US a chance--and then
              Kindo' fish back home again,
              Ketchin' 'em jes left and right

     But the dim roar o' the dam
         It 'ud coax us furder still
     To'rds the old race, slow and ca'm,

              Up and down old Brandywine!




WHEN EARLY MARCH SEEMS MIDDLE MAY


     When country roads begin to thaw
         In mottled spots of damp and dust,
     And fences by the margin draw
         Along the frosty crust
       Their graphic silhouettes, I say,
       The Spring is coming round this way.

     When morning-time is bright with sun
       And keen with wind, and both confuse
     The dancing, glancing eyes of one
         With tears that ooze and ooze--
       And nose-tips weep as well as they,
       The Spring is coming round this way.

     When suddenly some shadow-bird
       Goes wavering beneath the gaze,
     And through the hedge the moan is heard
         Of kine that fain would graze
       In grasses new, I smile and say,
       The Spring is coming round this way.

     When knotted horse-tails are untied,
       And teamsters whistle here and there.
     And clumsy mitts are laid aside
         And choppers' hands are bare,
       And chips are thick where children play,
       The Spring is coming round this way.

     When through the twigs the farmer tramps,
       And troughs are chunked beneath the trees,
     And fragrant hints of sugar-camps
         Astray in every breeze,--
       When early March seems middle May,
       The Spring is coming round this way.

     When coughs are changed to laughs, and when
       Our frowns melt into smiles of glee,
     And all our blood thaws out again
         In streams of ecstasy,
       And poets wreak their roundelay,
       The Spring is coming round this way.




A TALE OF THE AIRLY DAYS


     Oh! tell me a tale of the airly days--
       Of the times as they ust to be;
     "Piller of Fi-er" and "Shakespeare's Plays"
       Is a' most too deep fer me!
     I want plane facts, and I want plane words,
       Of the good old-fashioned ways,
     When speech run free as the songs of birds
       'Way back in the airly days.

     Tell me a tale of the timber-lands--
       Of the old-time pioneers;
     Somepin' a pore man understands
       With his feelins's well as ears.
     Tell of the old log house,--about
       The loft, and the puncheon flore--
     The old fi-er-place, with the crane swung out,
       And the latch-string thrugh the door.

     Tell of the things jest as they was--
       They don't need no excuse!--
     Don't tech 'em up like the poets does,
       Tel theyr all too fine fer use!--
     Say they was 'leven in the fambily--
       Two beds, and the chist, below,
     And the trundle-beds that each helt three,
       And the clock and the old bureau.

     Then blow the horn at the old back-door
       Tel the echoes all halloo,
     And the childern gethers home onc't more,
       Jest as they ust to do:
     Blow fer Pap tel he hears and comes,
       With Tomps and Elias, too,
     A-marchin' home, with the fife and drums
       And the old Red White and Blue!

     Blow and blow tel the sound draps low
       As the moan of the whipperwill,
     And wake up Mother, and Ruth and Jo,
       All sleepin' at Bethel Hill:
     Blow and call tel the faces all
       Shine out in the back-log's blaze,
     And the shadders dance on the old hewed wall
       As they did in the airly days.




OLD MAN'S NURSERY RHYME


     I


     In the jolly winters
       Of the long-ago,
     It was not so cold as now--
       O! No! No!
     Then, as I remember,
       Snowballs to eat
     Were as good as apples now.
       And every bit as sweet!


     II


     In the jolly winters
       Of the dead-and-gone,
     Bub was warm as summer,
       With his red mitts on,--
     Just in his little waist-
       And-pants all together,
     Who ever hear him growl
       About cold weather?


     III


     In the jolly winters
       Of the long-ago--
     Was it HALF so cold as now?
       O! No! No!
     Who caught his death o' cold,
       Making prints of men
     Flat-backed in snow that now's
       Twice as cold again?


     IV


     In the jolly winters
       Of the dead-and-gone,
     Startin' out rabbit-huntin'--
       Early as the dawn,--
     Who ever froze his fingers,
       Ears, heels, or toes,--
     Or'd 'a' cared if he had?
       Nobody knows!


     V


     Nights by the kitchen-stove,
       Shellin' white and red
     Corn in the skillet, and
       Sleepin' four abed!
     Ah! the jolly winters
       Of the long-ago!
     We were not as old as now--
       O! No! No!




JUNE


     O queenly month of indolent repose!
         I drink thy breath in sips of rare perfume,
       As in thy downy lap of clover-bloom
     I nestle like a drowsy child and doze
     The lazy hours away. The zephyr throws
       The shifting shuttle of the Summer's loom
       And weaves a damask-work of gleam and gloom
     Before thy listless feet. The lily blows
       A bugle-call of fragrance o'er the glade;
         And, wheeling into ranks, with plume and spear,
       Thy harvest-armies gather on parade;
         While, faint and far away, yet pure and clear,
       A voice calls out of alien lands of shade:--
         All hail the Peerless Goddess of the Year!




THE TREE-TOAD


     "'S cur'ous-like," said the tree-toad,
       "I've twittered fer rain all day;
       And I got up soon,
       And hollered tel noon--
     But the sun, hit blazed away,
       Tell I jest clumb down in a crawfish-hole,
       Weary at hart, and sick at soul!

     "Dozed away fer an hour,
       And I tackled the thing agin:
         And I sung, and sung,
         Tel I knowed my lung
       Was jest about give in;
         And THEN, thinks I, ef hit don't rain NOW,
         They's nothin' in singin', anyhow!

     "Onc't in a while some farmer
       Would come a-drivin' past;
         And he'd hear my cry,
         And stop and sigh--
       Tel I jest laid back, at last,
         And I hollered rain tel I thought my th'oat
         Would bust wide open at ever' note!

     "But I FETCHED her!--O _I_ FETCHED her!--
       'Cause a little while ago,
         As I kindo' set,
         With one eye shet,
       And a-singin' soft and low,
         A voice drapped down on my fevered brain,
         A-sayin',--'EF YOU'LL JEST HUSH I'LL RAIN!'"




A SONG OF LONG AGO


     A song of Long Ago:
     Sing it lightly--sing it low--
     Sing it softly--like the lisping of the lips we
       used to know
     When our baby-laughter spilled
     From the glad hearts ever filled
     With music blithe as robin ever trilled!

     Let the fragrant summer breeze,
     And the leaves of locust-trees,
     And the apple-buds and blossoms, and the
         wings of honey-bees,
     All palpitate with glee,
     Till the happy harmony
     Brings back each childish joy to you and me.

     Let the eyes of fancy turn
     Where the tumbled pippins burn
     Like embers in the orchard's lap of tangled
         grass and fern,--
     There let the old path wind
     In and out and on behind
     The cider-press that chuckles as we grind.

     Blend in the song the moan
     Of the dove that grieves alone,
     And the wild whir of the locust, and the
         bumble's drowsy drone;
     And the low of cows that call
     Through the pasture-bars when all
     The landscape fades away at evenfall.

     Then, far away and clear,
     Through the dusky atmosphere,
     Let the wailing of the killdee be the only
         sound we hear:
     O sad and sweet and low
     As the memory may know
     Is the glad-pathetic song of Long Ago!




OLD WINTERS ON THE FARM


     I have jest about decided
       It 'ud keep a town-boy hoppin'
       Fer to work all winter, choppin'
     Fer a' old fireplace, like I did!
     Lawz! them old times wuz contrairy!--
       Blame' backbone o' winter, 'peared-like
       WOULDN'T break!--and I wuz skeered-like
     Clean on into FEB'UARY!
       Nothin' ever made me madder
     Than fer Pap to stomp in, layin'
     In a' extra forestick, say'in',
       "Groun'-hog's out and seed his shadder!"




ROMANCIN'


     I' b'en a-kindo' "musin'," as the feller says, and I'm
       About o' the conclusion that they hain't no better
         time,
     When you come to cipher on it, than the times we ust to
       know
     When we swore our first "dog-gone-it" sorto' solum-like
       and low!

     You git my idy, do you?--LITTLE tads, you understand--
     Jest a-wishin' thue and thue you that you on'y wuz a
            MAN.--
     Yit here I am, this minit, even sixty, to a day,
     And fergittin' all that's in it, wishm' jest the other way!

     I hain't no hand to lectur' on the times, er dimonstrate
     Whare the trouble is, er hector and domineer with Fate,--
     But when I git so flurried, and so pestered-like and blue,
     And so rail owdacious worried, let me tell you what I
           do!--

     I jest gee-haw the hosses, and onhook the swingle-tree,
     Whare the hazel-bushes tosses down theyr shadders over
           me;
     And I draw my plug o' navy, and I climb the fence, and
           set
     Jest a-thinkin' here, i gravy' tel my eyes is wringin'-wet!

     Tho' I still kin see the trouble o' the PRESUNT, I kin see--
     Kindo' like my sight wuz double-all the things that
           UST to be;
     And the flutter o' the robin and the teeter o' the wren
     Sets the willer-branches bobbin' "howdy-do" thum Now
         to Then!

     The deadnin' and the thicket's jest a-bilin' full of June,
     From the rattle o' the cricket, to the yallar-hammer's
         tune;
     And the catbird in the bottom, and the sapsuck on the
         snag,
     Seems ef they can't-od-rot 'em!-jest do nothin' else
         but brag!

     They's music in the twitter of the bluebird and the jay,
     And that sassy little critter jest a-peckin' all the day;
     They's music in the "flicker," and they's music in the
         thrush,
     And they's music in the snicker o' the chipmunk in the
         brush!

     They's music all around me!--And I go back, in a dream
     Sweeter yit than ever found me fast asleep,--and in the
         stream
     That list to split the medder whare the dandylions
         growed,
     I stand knee-deep, and redder than the sunset down the
         road.

     Then's when I' b'en a-fishin'!--And they's other fellers,
         too,
     With theyr hick'ry-poles a-swishin' out behind 'em; and
         a few
     Little "shiners" on our stringers, with theyr tails tip--
         toein' bloom,
     As we dance 'em in our fingers all the happy jurney
         home.

     I kin see us, true to Natur', thum the time we started out,
     With a biscuit and a 'tater in our little "roundabout"!--
     I kin see our lines a-tanglin', and our elbows in a jam,
     And our naked legs a-danglin' thum the apern o' the dam.

     I kin see the honeysuckle climbin' up around the mill,
     And kin hear the worter chuckle, and the wheel a-growl-
         in' still;
     And thum the bank below it I kin steal the old canoe,
     And jest git in and row it like the miller ust to do.

     W'y, I git my fancy focussed on the past so mortul plane
     I kin even smell the locus'-blossoms bloomin' in the lane;
     And I hear the cow-bells clinkin' sweeter tunes 'n
         "Money-musk"'
     Fer the lightnin' bugs a-blinkin' and a-dancin' in the dusk.

     And when I've kep' on "musin'," as the feller says, tel I'm
     Firm-fixed in the conclusion that they haint no better
         time,
     When you come to cipher on it, than the old times,--I
         de-clare
     I kin wake and say "dog-gone-it'" jest as soft as any
         prayer!

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
