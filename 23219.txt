I

This garden of our childhood, said Monsieur Bergeret, this garden that
one could pace off in twenty steps, was for us a whole world, full of
smiles and surprises.

"Lucien, do you recall Putois?" asked Zoe, smiling as usual, the lips
pressed, bending over her work.

"Do I recall Putois! Of all the faces I saw as a child that of Putois
remains the clearest in my remembrance. All the features of his face and
his character are fixed in my mind. He had a pointed cranium..."

"A low forehead," added Mademoiselle Zoe.

And the brother and sister recited alternately, in a monotonous voice,
with an odd gravity, the points in a sort of description:

"A low forehead."

"Squinting eyes."

"A shifty glance."

"Crow's-feet at the temples."

"The cheek-bones sharp, red and shining."

"His ears had no rims to them."

"The features were devoid of all expression."

"His hands, which were never still, alone expressed his meaning."

"Thin, somewhat bent, feeble in appearance..."

"In reality he was unusually strong."

"He easily bent a five-franc piece between the first finger and the
thumb..."

"Which was enormous."

"His voice was drawling..."

"And his speech mild."

Suddenly Monsieur Bergeret exclaimed: "Zoe! we have forgotten 'Yellow
hair and sparse beard.' Let us begin all over again."

Pauline, who had listened with astonishment to this strange recital,
asked her father and aunt how they had been able to learn by heart this
bit of prose, and why they recited it as if it were a litany.

Monsieur Bergeret gravely answered:

"Pauline, what you have heard is a text, I may say a liturgy, used by
the Bergeret family. It should be handed down to you so that it may
not perish with your aunt and me. Your grandfather, my daughter, your
grandfather, Eloi Bergeret, who was not amused with trifles, thought
highly of this bit, principally because of its origin. He called it 'The
Anatomy of Putois.' And he used to say that he preferred, in certain
respects, the anatomy of Putois to the anatomy of Quaresmeprenant. 'If
the description by Xenomanes,' he said, 'is more learned and richer
in unusual and choice expressions, the description of Putois greatly
surpasses it in clarity and simplicity of style.' He held this opinion
because Doctor Ledouble, of Tours, had not yet explained chapters
thirty, thirty-one, and thirty-two of the fourth book of Rabelais."

"I do not understand at all," said Pauline.

"That is because you did not know Putois, my daughter. You must
understand that Putois was the most familiar figure in my childhood and
in that of your Aunt Zoe. In the house of your grandfather Bergeret we
constantly spoke of Putois. Each believed that he had seen him."

Pauline asked:

"Who was this Putois?"

Instead of replying, Monsieur Bergeret commenced to laugh, and
Mademoiselle Bergeret also laughed, her lips pressed tight together.
Pauline looked from one to the other. She thought it strange that her
aunt should laugh so heartily, and more strange that she should laugh
with and in sympathy with her brother. It was indeed singular, as the
brother and sister were quite different in character.

"Papa, tell me what was Putois? Since you wish me to know, tell me."

"Putois, my daughter, was a gardener. The son of honest
market-gardeners, he set up for himself as nurseryman at Saint-Omer. But
he did not satisfy his customers and got in a bad way. Having given
up business, he went out by the day. Those who employed him could not
always congratulate themselves."

At this, Mademoiselle Bergeret, laughing, rejoined;

"Do you recall, Lucien, when our father could not find his ink, his
pens, his sealing-wax, his scissors, he said: 'I suspect Putois has been
here'?"

"Ah!" said Monsieur Bergeret, "Putois had not a good reputation."

"Is that all?" asked Pauline.

"No, my daughter, it is not all. Putois was remarkable in this, that
while we knew him and were familiar with him, nevertheless--"

"--He did not exist," said Zoe.

Monsieur Bergeret looked at his sister with an air of reproach.

"What a speech, Zoe! and why break the charm like that? Do you dare say
it, Zoe? Zoe, can you prove it? To maintain that Putois did not exist,
that Putois never was, have you sufficiently considered the conditions
of existence and the modes of being? Putois existed, my sister. But it
is true that his was a peculiar existence."

"I understand less and less," said Pauline, discouraged.

"The truth will be clear to you presently, my daughter. Know then that
Putois was born fully grown. I was still a child and your aunt was a
little girl. We lived in a little house, in a suburb of Saint-Omer. Our
parents led a peaceful, retired life, until they were discovered by
an old lady named Madame Cornouiller, who lived at the manor of
Montplaisir, twelve miles from town, and proved to be a great-aunt of
my mother's. By right of relationship she insisted that our father
and mother come to dine every Sunday at Montplaisir, where they were
excessively bored. She said that it was the proper thing to have a
family dinner on Sunday and that only people of common origin failed to
observe this ancient custom. My father was bored to the point of tears
at Montplaisir. His desperation was painful to contemplate. But Madame
Cornouiller did not notice it. She saw nothing, My mother was braver.
She suffered as much as my father, and perhaps more, but she smiled."

"Women are made to suffer," said Zoe.

"Zoe, every living thing is destined to suffer. In vain our parents
refused these fatal invitations. Madame Cornouiller came to take
them each Sunday afternoon. They had to go to Montplaisir; it was
an obligation from which there was absolutely no escape. It was an
established order that only a revolt could break. My father finally
revolted and swore not to accept another invitation from Madame
Cornouiller, leaving it to my mother to find decent pretexts and varied
reasons for these refusals, for which she was the least capable. Our
mother did not know how to pretend."

"Say, Lucien, that she did not like to. She could tell a fib as well as
any one."

"It is true that when she had good reasons she gave them rather than
invent poor ones. Do you recall, my sister, that one day she said at
table: 'Fortunately, Zoe has the whooping-cough; we shall not have to go
to Montplaisir for some time'?"

"That was true!" said Zoe.

"You got over it, Zoe. And one day Madame Cornouiller said to my mother:
Dearest, I count on your coming with your husband to dine Sunday at
Montplaisir.' Our mother, expressly bidden by her husband to give Madame
Cornouiller a good reason for declining, invented, in this extremity, a
reason that was not the truth. 'I am extremely sorry, dear Madame, but
that will be impossible for us. Sunday I expect the gardener.'

"On hearing this, Madame Cornouiller looked through the glass door of
the salon at the little wild garden, where the prickwood and the lilies
looked as though they had never known the pruning-knife and were likely
never to know it. 'You expect the gardener! What for?'

"'To work in the garden.'

"And my mother, having involuntarily turned her eyes on this little
square of weeds and plants run wild, that she had called a garden,
recognized with dismay the improbability of her excuse.

"'This man,' said Madame Cornouiller, 'could just as well work in your
garden Monday or Tuesday. Moreover, that will be much better.' One
should not work on Sunday.'

"'He works all the week.'

"I have often noticed that the most absurd and ridiculous reasons are
the least disputed: they disconcert the adversary. Madame Cornouiller
insisted, less than one might expect of a person so little disposed to
give up. Rising from her armchair, she asked:

"'What do you call your gardener, dearest?'

"'Putois,' answered my mother without hesitation.

"Putois was named. From that time he existed. Madame Cornouiller took
herself off, murmuring: 'Putois! It seems to me that I know that name.
Putois! Putois! I must know him. But I do not recollect him. Where does
he live?'

"'He works by the day. When one wants him one leaves word with this one
or that one.'

"'Ah! I thought so, a loafer and a vagabond--a good-for-nothing. Don't
trust him, dearest.'

"From that time Putois had a character.'"




II

Messieurs Goubin and Jean Marteau having arrived, Monsieur Bergeret put
them in touch with the conversation.

"We were speaking of him whom my mother caused to be born gardener at
Saint-Omer and whom she christened. He existed from that time on."

"Dear master, will you kindly repeat that?" said Monsieur Goubin, wiping
the glass of his monocle.

"Willingly," replied Monsieur Bergeret. "There was no gardener. The
gardener did not exist. My mother said: 'I am waiting for the gardener.'
At once the gardener was. He lived."

"Dear master," said Monsieur Goubin, "how could he live since he did not
exist?"

"He had a sort of existence," replied Monsieur Bergeret.

"You mean an imaginary existence," Monsieur Goubin replied,
disdainfully.

"Is it nothing then, but an imaginary existence?" exclaimed the master.
"And have not mythical beings the power to influence men! Consider
mythology, Monsieur Goubin, and you will perceive that they are not real
beings but imaginary beings that exercise the most profound and lasting
influence on the mind. Everywhere and always, beings who have no more
reality than Putois have inspired nations with hatred and love, terror
and hope, have advised crimes, received offerings, made laws and
customs. Monsieur Goubin, think of the eternal mythology. Putois is a
mythical personage, the most obscure, I grant you, and of the lowest
order. The coarse satyr, who in olden times sat at the table with our
peasants in the North, was considered worthy of appearing in a picture
by Jordaens and a fable by La Fontaine. The hairy son of Sycorax
appeared in the noble world of Shakespeare. Putois, less fortunate,
will be always neglected by artists and poets. He lacks bigness and the
unusual style and character. He was conceived by minds too reasonable,
among people who knew how to read and write, and who had not that
delightful imagination in which fables take root. I think, Messieurs,
that I have said enough to show you the real nature of Putois."

"I understand it," said Monsieur Goubin. And Monsieur Bergeret continued
his discourse.

"Putois was. I can affirm it. He was. Consider it, gentlemen, and you
will admit that a state of being by no means implies substance, and
means only the bonds attributed to the subject, expresses only a
relation."

"Undoubtedly," said Jean Marteau; "but a being without attributes is a
being less than nothing. I do not remember who at one time said, 'I am
that I am.' Pardon my lapse of memory. One cannot remember everything.
But the unknown who spoke in that fashion was very imprudent. In letting
it be understood by this thoughtless observation that he was deprived of
attributes and denied all relations, he proclaimed that he did not exist
and thoughtlessly suppressed himself. I wager that no one has heard of
him since."--"You have lost," answered Monsieur Bergeret.

"He corrected the bad effect of these egotistical expressions by
employing quantities of adjectives, and he is often spoken of,
most often without judgment."--"I do not understand," said Monsieur
Goubin.--"It is not necessary to understand," replied Jean Marteau. And
he begged Monsieur Bergeret to speak of Putois.--"It is very kind of you
to ask me," said the master.--"Putois was born in the second half of the
nineteenth century, at Saint-Omer. He would have been better off if he
had been born some centuries before in the forest of Arden or in the
forest of Broceliande. He would then have been a remarkably clever evil
spirit."--"A cup of tea, Monsieur Goubin," said Pauline.--"Was Putois,
then, an evil spirit?" said Jean Marteau.--"He was evil," replied
Monsieur Bergeret; "he was, in a way, but not absolutely. It was true
of him as with those devils that are called wicked, but in whom one
discovers good qualities when one associates with them. And I
am disposed to think that injustice has been done Putois. Madame
Cornouiller, who, warned against him, had at once suspected him of being
a loafer, a drunkard, and a robber, reflected that since my mother, who
was not rich, employed him, it was because he was satisfied with little,
and asked herself if she would not do well to have him work instead of
her gardener, who had a better reputation, but expected more. The
time had come for trimming the yews. She thought that if Madame Eloi
Bergeret, who was poor, did not pay Putois much, she herself, who was
rich, would give him still less, for it is customary for the rich to
pay less than the poor. And she already saw her yews trimmed in straight
hedges, in balls and in pyramids, without her having to pay much. 'I
will keep an eye open,' she said, 'to see that Putois does not loaf
or rob me. I risk nothing, and it will be all profit. These vagabonds
sometimes do better work than honest laborers. She resolved to make a
trial, and said to my mother: 'Dearest, send me Putois. I will set him
to work at Mont-plaisir.' My mother would have done so willingly.
But really it was impossible. Madame Cornouiller waited for Putois at
Montplaisir, and waited in vain. She followed up her ideas and did not
abandon her plans. When she saw my mother again, she complained of not
having any news of Putois. 'Dearest, didn't you tell him that I was
expecting him?'--'Yes! but he is strange, odd.'--'Oh, I know that kind.
I know your Putois by heart. But there is no workman so crazy as to
refuse to come to work at Montplaisir. My house is known, I think.
Putois must obey my orders, and quickly, dearest. It will be sufficient
to tell me where he lives; I will go and find him myself.' My mother
answered that she did not know where Putois lived, that no one knew his
house, that he was without hearth or home. 'I have not seen him again,
Madame. I believe he is hiding.' What better could she say?"

Madame Cornouiller heard her distrustfully; she suspected her of
misleading, of removing Putois from inquiry, for fear of losing him or
making him ask more. And she thought her too selfish. "Many judgments
accepted by the world that history has sanctioned are as well founded as
that."--"That is true," said Pauline.--"What is true?" asked Zoe, half
asleep.--"That the judgments of history are often false. I remember,
papa, that you said one day: 'Madame Roland was very ingenuous to
appeal to the impartiality of posterity, and not perceive that, if her
contemporaries were ill-natured monkeys, their posterity would be also
composed of ill-natured monkeys.'"--"Pauline," said Mademoiselle Zoe
severely, "what connection is there between the story of Putois and this
that you are telling us?"--"A very great one, my aunt."--"I do not grasp
it."--Monsieur Bergeret, who was not opposed to digressions, answered
his daughter: "If all injustices were finally redressed in the world,
one would never have imagined another for these adjustments. How do you
expect posterity to pass righteous judgment on the dead? How question
them in the shades to which they have taken flight? As soon as we are
able to be just to them we forget them. But can one ever be just? And
what is justice? Madame Cornouiller, at least, was finally obliged to
recognize that my mother had not deceived her and that Putois was not to
be found. However, she did not give up trying to find him. She asked all
her relatives, friends, neighbors, servants, and tradesmen if they knew
Putois, Only two or three answered that they had never heard of him. For
the most part they believed they had seen him. 'I have heard that name,'
said the cook, 'but I cannot recall his face.'--'Putois! I must know
him,' said the street-sweeper, scratching his ear. 'But I cannot tell
you who it is.' The most precise description came from Monsieur Blaise,
receiver of taxes, who said that he had employed Putois to cut wood in
his yard, from the 19th to the 28d of October, the year of the comet.
One morning, Madame Cornouiller, out of breath, dropped into my father's
office. 'I have seen Putois. Ah! I have seen him.'--'You believe
it?'--'I am sure. He was passing close by Monsieur Tenchant's wall. Then
he turned into the Rue des Abbesses, walking quickly. I lost him.'--'Was
it really he?'--'Without a doubt. A man of fifty, thin, bent, the air of
a vagabond, a dirty blouse.'--'It is true,'" said my father, "'that this
description could apply to Putois.'--'You see! Besides, I called him. I
cried: "Putois!" and he turned around.'--'That is the method,' said
my father, 'that they employ to assure themselves of the identity of
evil-doers that they are hunting for.'--'I told you that it was he! I
know how to find him, your Putois. Very well! He has a bad face. You
had been very careless, you and your wife, to employ him. I understand
physiognomy, and though I only saw his back, I could swear that he is a
robber, and perhaps an assassin. The rims of his ears are flat, and that
is a sign that never fails.'--'Ah! you noticed that the rims of his ears
were flat?'--'Nothing escapes me. My dear Monsieur Bergeret, if you do
not wish to be assassinated with your wife and your children, do not let
Putois come into your house again. Take my advice: have all your
locks changed.'--Well, a few days afterward, it happened that Madame
Cornouiller had three melons stolen from her vegetable garden. The
robber not having been found, she suspected Putois. The gendarmes were
called to Montplaisir, and their report confirmed the suspicions of
Madame Cornouiller. Bands of marauders were ravaging the gardens of the
countryside. But this time the robbery seemed to have been committed by
one man, and with singular dexterity. No trace of anything broken, no
footprints in the damp earth. The robber could be no one but Putois.
That was the opinion of the corporal, who knew all about Putois, and
had tried hard to put his hand on that bird. The 'Journal of Saint-Omer'
devoted an article to the three melons of Madame Cornouiller, and
published a portrait of Putois from descriptions furnished by the town.
'He has,' said the paper, 'a low forehead, squinting eyes, a shifty
glance, crow's-feet, sharp cheek-bones, red and shining. No rims to
the ears. Thin, somewhat bent, feeble in appearance, in reality he is
unusually strong. He easily bends a five-franc piece between the first
finger and the thumb.' There were good reasons for attributing to him a
long series of robberies committed with surprising dexterity. The whole
town was talking of Putois. One day it was learned that he had been
arrested and locked up in prison. But it was soon recognized that the
man that had been taken for him was an almanac seller named Rigobert. As
no charge could be brought against him, he was discharged after fourteen
months of detention on suspicion. And Putois remained undiscoverable.
Madame Cornouiller was the victim of another robbery, more audacious
than the first. Three small silver spoons were taken from her sideboard.
She recognized in this the hand of Putois, had a chain put on the door
of her bedroom, and was unable to sleep....

About ten o'clock in the evening, Pauline having gone to her room,
Mademoiselle Bergeret said to her brother: "Do not forget to relate how
Putois betrayed Madame Cornouiller's cook."--"I was thinking of it, my
sister," answered Monsieur Bergeret. "To omit it would be to lose the
best of the story. But everything must be done in order. Putois was
carefully searched for by the police, who could not find him. When it
was known that he could not be found, each one considered it his duty to
find him; the shrewd ones succeeded. And as there were many shrewd ones
at Saint-Omer and in the suburbs, Putois was seen simultaneously in the
streets, in the fields, and in the woods. Another trait was thus added
to his character. He was accorded the gift of ubiquity, the attribute
of many popular heroes. A being capable of leaping long distances in
a moment, and suddenly showing himself at the place where he was least
expected, was honestly frightening. Putois was the terror of Saint-Omer.
Madame Cornouiller, convinced that Putois had stolen from her three
melons and three little spoons, lived in a state of fear, barricaded at
Montplaisir. Bolts, bars, and locks did not reassure her. Putois was
for her a frightfully subtle being who could pass through doors. Trouble
with her servants redoubled her fear. Her cook having been betrayed,
the time came when she could no longer hide her misfortune. But she
obstinately refused to name her betrayer."--"Her name was Gudule," said
Mademoiselle Zoe.--"Her name was Gudule, and she believed that she was
protected from danger by a long, forked bead that she wore on her chin.
The sudden appearance of a beard protected the innocence of that holy
daughter of the king that Prague venerates. A beard, no longer youthful,
did not suffice to protect the virtue of Gudule. Madame Cornouiller
urged Gudule to tell her the man. Gudule burst into tears, but kept
silent. Prayers and menaces had no effect. Madame Cornouiller made a
long and circumstantial inquiry. She adroitly questioned her neighbors
and tradespeople, the gardener, the street-sweeper, the gendarmes;
nothing put her on the track of the culprit. She tried again to obtain
from Gudule a complete confession. 'In your own interest, Gudule, tell
me who it is.' Gudule remained mute. All at once a ray of light flashed
through the mind of Madame Cornouiller: 'It is Putois!' The cook cried,
but did not answer. 'It is Putois! Why did I not guess it sooner? It
is Putois! Miserable! miserable! miserable!' and Madame Cornouiller
remained convinced that it was Putois. Everybody at Saint-Omer, from the
judge to the lamplighter's dog, knew Gudule and her basket At the news
that Putois had betrayed Gudule, the town was filled with surprise,
wonder, and merriment....

With this reputation in the town and its environs he remained attached
to our house by a thousand subtle ties. He passed before our door, and
it was believed that he sometimes climbed the wall of our garden. He was
never seen face to face. At any moment we would recognize his shadow,
his voice, his footsteps. More than once we thought we saw his back in
the twilight, at the corner of a road. To my sister and me he gradually
changed in character. He remained mischievous and malevolent, but he
became childlike and very ingenuous. He became less real and, I
dare say, more poetical. He entered in the artless Cycle of childish
traditions. He became more like Croquemitaine,* like Pere Fouettard, or
the sand man who closes the children's eyes when evening comes.

     *The national "bugaboo" or "bogy man."

It was not that imp that tangled the colts' tails at night in the
stable. Less rustic and less charming, but equally and frankly roguish,
he made ink mustaches on my sister's dolls. In our bed, before going to
sleep, we listened; he cried on the roofs with the cats, he howled with
the dogs, he filled the mill hopper with groans, and imitated the songs
of belated drunkards in the streets. What made Putois ever-present and
familiar to us, what interested us in him, was that the remembrance of
him was associated with all the objects about us. Zoe's dolls, my school
books, in which he had many times rumpled and besmeared the pages; the
garden wall, over which we had seen his red eyes gleam in the shadow;
the blue porcelain jar that he cracked one winter's night, unless it
was the frost; the trees, the streets, the benches--everything recalled
Putois, the children's Putois, a local and mythical being. He did not
equal in grace and poetry the dullest satyr, the stoutest fawn of
Sicily or Thessaly. But he was still a demigod. He had quite a different
character for our father; he was symbolical and philosophical. Our
father had great compassion for men. He did not think them altogether
rational; their mistakes, when they were not cruel, amused him and
made him smile. The belief in Putois interested him as an epitome and a
summary of all human beliefs. As he was ironical and a joker, he spoke
of Putois as if he were a real being. He spoke with so much insistence
sometimes, and detailed the circumstances with such exactness, that my
mother was quite surprised and said to him in her open-hearted way:
'One would say that you spoke seriously, my friend: you know well,
however...' He replied gravely: 'All Saint-Omer believes in the
existence of Putois. Would I be a good citizen if I deny him? One should
look twice before setting aside an article of common faith.' Only
a perfectly honest soul has such scruples. At heart my father was a
Gassendiste.* He keyed his own particular sentiment with the public
sentiment, believing, like the countryside, in the existence of Putois,
but not admitting his direct responsibility for the theft of the
melons and the betrayal of the cook. Finally, he professed faith in the
existence of a Putois, to be a good citizen; and he eliminated Putois in
his explanations of the events that took place in the town. By doing so
in this instance, as in all others, he was an honorable and a sensible
man.

     * A follower of Gassendi (d. 1655), an exponent of Epicurus.

"As for our mother, she reproached herself somewhat for the birth of
Putois, and not without reason. Because, after all, Putois was the child
of our mother's invention, as Caliban was the poet's invention. Without
doubt the faults were not equal, and my mother was more innocent than
Shakespeare. However, she was frightened and confused to see her little
falsehood grow inordinately, and her slight imposture achieve such a
prodigious success, that, without stopping, extended all over town
and threatened to extend over the world. One day she even turned pale,
believing that she would see her falsehood rise up before her. That day,
a servant she had, new to the house and the town, came to say to her
that a man wished to see her. He wished to speak to Madame. 'What man
is it?'--'A man in a blouse. He looks like a laborer.'--'Did he give his
name?'--'Yes, Madame.'--'Well! what is his name?'--'Putois.'--'He told
you that was his name?'--'Putois, yes, Madame.'--'He is here?'--'Yes,
Madame. He is waiting in the kitchen.'--'You saw him?'--'Yes,
Madame.'--'What does he want?'--'He did not say. He will only tell
Madame.'--'Go ask him.'

"When the servant returned to the kitchen Putois was gone. This meeting
of the new servant with Putois was never cleared up. But from that day
I think my mother commenced to believe that Putois might well exist and
that she had not told a falsehood after all."

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
