    [Transcriber's Notes:

    This early English text was printed in a black-letter font. Some of
    the letters used are not found on a typewriter. In the e-text those
    letters that have no modern equivalent are transcribed with their
    meaning. For example, there is a letter that looks like a "w" with a
    "t" over it. This means with. You will find this in the text as
    [with]. Others you will find are [per], [the], [that], and [thou].
    You will also find the suffix [us].

    All typos were kept as close as possible to the original. This
    e-text is based on the 1907 edition which included a long list of
    these typos and some of their possible meanings along with the
    editor's note. This list had many letters typeset upside down. For
    this e-text they were righted.

    Long s has been changed to standard short s.

    In the plain text version, letters with a macron over them are
    denoted by placing them in brackets with an = beside them, such as
    [=e] for an e with a macron over it. For smoother reading, a and o
    are shown with tilde.

    Speaker names are surrounded by + like +Health+.

    For those that wish to consult the original, black and white pngs
    have been included in the archive.]

Early in the craft year which began on 19 July 1557, and was the first
of the chartered existence of the Stationers' Company, John Waley, or
Wally, entered what was no doubt the present play on the Register along
with several other works. The entry runs as follows:

     To master John wally these bokes Called Welth and helthe/the
     treatise of the ffrere and the boye / stans puer ad mensam another
     of youghte charyte and humylyte an a b c for cheldren in englesshe
     with syllabes also a boke called an hundreth mery tayles ij^s
     [Arber's Transcript, I. 75.]

That Waley printed an edition is therefore to be presumed, but it does
not necessarily follow that the extant copy, which though perfect bears
neither date nor printer's name, ever belonged to it. Indeed, a
comparison with a number of works to which he did affix his name
suggests grave doubts on the subject. Though not a high-class printer,
there seems no reason to ascribe to him a piece of work which for
badness alike of composition and press-work appears to be unique among
the dramatic productions of the sixteenth century.

'Wealth and health' appears among the titles in the list of plays
appended to the edition of Goffe's _Careless Shepherdess_, printed for
Rogers and Ley in 1656. The entry was repeated with the designation
'C[omedy].' in Archer's list of the same year, and, without the
addition, in those of Kirkman in 1661 and 1671. In 1691 Langbaine wrote
'_Wealth and Health_, a Play of which I can give no Account.' Gildon has
no further information to offer, nor have any of his immediate
followers. Chetwood, in 1752, classes it among 'Plays Wrote by Anonymous
Authors in the 16th [by which he means the seventeenth] Century,' calls
it 'an Interlude' and dates it 1602. This invention was only copied in
those lists which depended directly on Chetwood's, such as the
_Playhouse Pocket-Companion_ of 1779. Meanwhile, in his _Companion to
the Play-House_ of 1764, D.E. Baker, relying upon Coxeter's notes, gave
an essentially accurate description of the piece, except that he
asserted it to be 'full of Sport and mery Pastyme,' and described it as
an octavo. This entry has been copied by subsequent bibliographers, none
of whom have seen the original.

The play was among those discovered in Ireland in the spring of 1906 and
sold at Sotheby's on 30 June, when it was purchased for the British
Museum at the price of one hundred and ninety-five pounds. Its
press-mark is C. 34. i. 25.

The extremely careless typography of the original makes the task of
reprinting a difficult one. Ordinary misprints abound, and these have
been scrupulously retained, a list of irregularities being added below.
It has, however, proved impossible to arrive at any satisfactory method
of distinguishing between 'n' and 'u.' In the first hundred lines, which
are by no means the worst printed, there are thirty-two cases in which
the letter is indistinguishable, eighteen cases of an apparent 'u' which
should be 'n,' and seven cases of an apparent 'n' which should be 'u.'
When it is further remembered that there are few cases in which it is
possible to say for certain that a letter really is what it appears to
be, and none in which it may not be turned, some idea of the difficulty
in the way of reprinting will be obtained. To have followed the original
in this matter would have been to introduce another misprint into at
least every fourth line, while even so several hundred cases would have
remained which could only have been decided according to the apparent
sense of the passage. The only rational course was to treat the letters
as indistinguishable throughout, and to print in each instance
whichever the sense seemed to require. Again, as the superscript letters
'c,' 'e,' 't,' are seldom distinguishable, the printer has been given
the benefit of the doubt. Another difficulty arose in connection with
the speakers' names. In the original these have often dropt from their
proper places, which can now only be ascertained from the sense and the
not very regular indentation. With some hesitation it has been decided
to restore them to the positions they should apparently occupy, noting
all cases in which they are a line or more out in the original. Lastly
it may be remarked that in the speeches which aim at imitating foreign
languages the apparent readings of the very indistinct original have
been scrupulously reproduced, and no attempt has been made, even in the
subjoined list, to suggest any corrections.

In the last sheet some of the pages are cropt at the foot. In most cases
nothing more than the catchword has disappeared, and although between
lines 768 and 769 something seems to be lost, it is doubtful whether
this is due to the cropping, since D1^v has already one line too many.

The original is printed in the ordinary black letter of the period, of
the body known as English (20 ll. = 94 mm.).

 Here entreth Welth, and Helth synging together
a balet of two partes, and after speaketh
Welth.

Why is there no curtesy, now I am come
I tcowe that all the people be dume
Or els so god helpe me and halydum
They were almost a fleepe.
  No wordes I harde, nor yet no talking
No instrument went nor ballattes synging
What ayles you all thus to syt dreaming                               10
Of whom take ye care?
  Of my coming ye may be glad
Therefore I pray you be nof sad
For all your desyre shall be had
I can amende your cheare
  By God I thinke ye haue forgotten me
I am welth of this realme looke upon me
For I am to euery man louing and freendly
For welth hath no pere.

  +Helth.+ Brother welth haue ye not yet doone?                       20
ye prayse your selfe aboue the moone
Euery man may perceyue therby soone
That you lacke discresyon

  +Weith.+ Wherfore, by god I cannot say to much
Iam so welthy of substaunce and rych
In all the worlde where is one such
As I am ofcomparison.

  +Helth.+ Welth is good I cannot denay
Yet prayse your selfe so muche ye may
For welth oftentimes doth decay                                       30
And welth is nothing sure.

  +Welth.+ Welth hath ben euer in this countrey
And here I purpose styll for to be
For this is the lande most mete for me
  And here I wyll endure.

  +Health+ Therin ye speake full louingle
For in this realme welth should be
yeth no displeasure I pray you hartely
But in the way of communicacion.
  And for pastyme I would speake some wayes                           40
Of no comparison, nor to you no dyspayre,
I doo not intende that maner alwayes,
But for a recreation,

  +Wealth+ Brother what soeuer ye say to me.
I wyll heare you paciently
I am content and I thanke you hartely
Begyn and say your pleasure

  +Health+ I thanke you hartely then wyll I
Some what unto my purpose apply
Though welth be praised marualufly                                    50
Yet to myne understanding.
Welth is mutable, and that iu shame
And welth is hauty and proude of name
Welth is cruell, and in great blame
For welth ts euer wauerynge.

  +Wealth.+ To whom haue I doone any harme can ye say,
Ye stander me nowe, yet I trust I may
Aunswere for my selte in euery maner way
Ye wyl not deny that?

  +Health+ God forbyd but ye should do so                             60
And ye may doo it whether I wyl or no
Inlykewise, I must answer you also
Wh en ye say not true.
Though I be but to you a poore man
yet helth I height, the same I am
That is desyred vniuersally than
Some calles me as good as you

  +Welth.+ As I, mary ther in deede ye do compare.
Such wordes myght brynge you soone in care
Lewde parson, thouart not ware                                        70
Of what substaunce I am

  +Health.+ Yes I can tell what you are, be not dyspleased
welth is of great substaunce, that cannot be denyed
yet shew your comodities, and ye shalbe answerrd
I promyse you wellh is fugitiue.

  +wealth+ What sayst thou, am I a fagetyue
I was neuer so taken vp in my lyfe
Nor called vnsure, well I wyll make no stryfe
yet where as thou dost say,
  Thai I should show my commodityes alwayes                           80
The best for my selfe wherof I aske prayse
yf I shoulde stand her all my lyfe dayes
yet I coulde not say.
  Nor halfe the benefites that commeth of me
yt cannot be tolde nor resyted shortly
Welth is the floure of althing earthly
That you cannot denye.
  Ferste god saue, our soueraine Ladye the Queene
With all the counsel and all that with them bene
Am not I welth with them euer at ene                                  90
Who should be there but I?
  Men of the lawe, and ioly rych marchauntes
There be welthy both of goodes and lands,
Without comparyson is in their handes
I welth hatg all freasure.

  +Health.+ O good syr, of whom commeth all this
Of god only, to you no thanke Iwys
And yet mans welth stands not all in ryches
I dare saye that boldly,
  Whan a man hath a cempetent liuing                                 100
with the grace of god that passeth all thyng
Loue of his neyghbour, and good reporting
Then is he welthy,
  Welth of goodes is but a fame
Ye is welthy that hath a good name
Euery wyse man wyll coueyte the same
For otherwelth I not reche
  yf a man haue neuer so much good name
Euerywise man wyll coueyte the same
if his dtsposicions be nought and wood                               110
Then he is but a wretch,

  +Welth.+ Nay thou art a wretch, and a foole vnwyse
welth of ryches thus to despyse
Doest thou not se all the worlde aryse
By goodes and substaunce
  He that hath plenty of syluer and golde
May haue all thyng whatsoeuer he woulde
Whan can welth lacke, seing all thing is solde
And welth is of assuraunce.

  +Health+ I denye that, your saying is nought                       120
Grace, heauen, nor cunning, cannot be bought
without great paine, ad good dedes wrought
Els man cannot them haue.

  +wealth+ Stop thereat, and hold thy peace
May not men by heauen with richesse
As to bylde churches and make bye wayes
Such deedes mans soule doth saue

  +Health+ Yea, but yet ye must marke one thynge
yf these goodes came with wronge doyng
Shall ye haue heauen for so spendynge                                130
Or yet any mede.
  Nay nay except that man himselfe doo meeke
And make resystance the ryght honour to seeke
Els all such good dedes is not woth a leeke
welth hereof take heede.

  +wealth.+ Why thinkest thou that all men which hath welth
Getteth theyr goodes with brybry and stealeth
Thy reporte is nought therfore Helthe
I counsell thee to say the best.

  +Health+ So I wyll, but yet I must say true                        140
And now a lyttle more I wyll say to you
Much sorowe and care welth doth brewe
He is seldome in rest.
  when a man is a lyttle hit and welthy
And hath in his cheste treasures plentye
Then wyl he wrangle, and do shreudly
By his power and might.
With his neighboures he wyll go to lawe
  And a wreke his malyce for valew of strawe
welth is fykle and out nf awe                                        150
wylfull in wronge or ryght

  +Welth.+ Thou speakest with a slaunderous tonge
All of euyll wyll, and yet it is wronge
welth in this realme hath bin longe
Of me commeth great honour.
  Because that I welth hath great porte
All the worlde, hyther doth resorte
Therfore I welth, am this realmes comfort,
And here I wyll indure.

  +Helth.+ So I wold ye should, and I shall do the same              160
Helth I am called, and that is my name
If I would not abyde heare I were to blame
For here I am well cherished
  Yet say your selfe, nhw indifferenily
And if euery man doo not loue me
Helth as well as welth, yes verely
Therof I dare be reported

  +Weith.+ Why should they loue thee? that woulde I knowe
As wel as me, I pray you showe
I am the superiour of hie and lowe                                   170
No man may compare with me.

  +Helth.+ To shew why I wyll not be afraied
For I can bide by that I haue sayde
Yf welthy men be very well apayd
Or muche they set you by.
  But of welth, if they haue neuer so much
Goodes, tryasure and golde, and be called rych
Yet yfthey lacke helth, there payne is suche
That they were better dye.
  A man to were golde, and be in payne                               180
What ioy hath he? none, but would be fayne
To giue all his treasure for helth playne
Or els he were very mad:
  For if a man be neuer so poure
Yet if he haue helth, that is a treasure,
Then for his liuing, he may laboure
And in his harte be glad,

  +Welth.+ I neuer marked thus muche, nor vnderstood
That Helth was such a treasure, and to man so good
Wherfore I am sory, and I wil chaunge my moode                       190
Now I pray you forgiue me.

  +Health+ I will forgiue or els I were to blame
And I pray you to forgiue me the same
I loue you hartly, and wyll prayse your name
yf it please youto keepe my company.

 Here entreth lyberty with a song & after speaketh

  +libert+ Why tary syrs whether are ye going
I see well ye looked not for my comming
Loe, out of syght out of remembryng
Absence is cause of straungnes,                                      200
  What looke ye on werwhy are ye so straunge
From your fellow liberty, doth your minds cha[=u]ge
In your company I was wont to range
What nedes all this busines,

  +wealth+ By liberty now I doo not set
Seyng that helth and I am met
As feloweh together no man shall let
Me for to loue hym best.

  +liberty.+ Let me heare what ye do say
Then ye are about to cast me away                                    210
How happes this? mary then I may
Goe pyke strawes and take me rest.
  I pray you tell me whom I haue offended
yf I haue made a faute it shalde amended
with so shorte warning let me not be voyded
I crow yet ye do but iest.

  +Helth.+ Why do ye make this cauelacion
we entende to make no alteracyon
welth and I haue had communication
He is my freende of olde.                                            220

  +liberty+ What was the matter, I pray you tell
Me thinkes I ought to be of counsel
Or els I promyse you ye doo not well
With you I should beholde.

  +Welth.+ The matter is doone we are agreed
To reason it more it shall not neede
O brother helth, thou art in deede
More preciouser than golde.

  +liberty.+ Gods bodi how commeth this gere to pas
I am cast out at the cartes arse                                     230
The worlde is nothing as it was
For I am here refused

  +Health+ Why be you angry that we doo agree
Then are ye not wyse, for ifye loue me
I will loue hym agayne, so it should be
Or els I were mysaduised

  +yllibert+ Then of my loue ye set no store
My company I see well ye looked notfore
Farewell I wyll get me out of the doore
yet I am your betters and so am I called.                            240

  +wealth+ Such presumptuouse wordes wyll haue a fall
your comparyson is but feble and small
What can ye do nothyng at all
As you haue reputed.

  +liberti.+ What were ye both two, were not I.
Wretches and caytyfes, looke not so hye
Thinke no scorne hardly
For I may be your peare
  yf welth haue neuer so much lubstaunce
Lacking Libertye and werr in durance                                 250
Within a whyce, I am in assurance
ye woulde pray me come nere.
  Yf Helth be neuer so lust and stronge
yet if Lyberty were kept from him longe
Then sorow and care wolde be his songe.
yt would abate your cheare.
  Fye of welth which lacketh lybertye
Fye of H elth and be in captiuitie
Fye of riches and lack good company
Lyberty hath no pere,                                                260

  +Helth.+ Wyll ye heare how he doth clatter?
What neede ye to rehearse all this matter.
ye know that we twayne afore any other.
Lyberty must nedes haue styll.
  Lybertie on vs is glade to wayte
ye stande to farre in your owne conceyte
I wys lybertye ye ran make no bayte
To catche vs at your will.

  +liberty.+ Now there ye lye, I can suffer no longer
Welth for Lybertye doth loboure euer                                 270
And helth for Libertye is a great store
Therfore set me not so lyght

  +wealth+ Libertye I pray the reason no more

In dede ofliberty it is great suter
Therfore welcome by this lyght

  +liberty,+ Now I thanke you both full kindly
your strange wordes alytle did greue me
And now at your coma[=u]dement I am redy
And at your owne wyll.                                               280

       Here entreth with some iest yllwyll

  +Wyll..+ Mary I am come at the first call
Wyll, your owne man haue me who shall
For I am will seruaunt to you al
Ye shall not neede to sende for me.

  +Welth.+ Who is acquanted with this man
He is very homely and lytle good he can
To come in here so boldly, then
Dryue him away quickly,

  +Wy ll.+ Why, I cam not tyll I was called                          290
your owne wyll openly ye named
Then I came a pace lest I should be blamed
Therfore I pray you let me byde styll,

  +ealth+ Whole wyll, or what wyll, doth he meane
Thou art not my wyl, I forsake thee cleane
My wyl and their wylles is often sene
Our wylles can none yll

  +Wyll.+ Alas good masters I can none yll
yet by my trouth I am your euyll wyll
your wil, & your will, & your will, therfore keepe me                300
I loue ye by goddes mother,

  +liberty.+ This is a straunge saying vnto me
My wyl, your wyll, and his wyll, this cannot be
For in our wyles is a great diuersitie
For one is not lyke another,

  +Wyll.+ Yet by Christ your owne wyl I am
The maddest wyl, and the meriest, than
For goddes sake now, let me be your man
Tyl ye haue better acquaintaunce.

  +wealth+ I perceyue this felow is kynde                            310
And oweth to vs good wyl and mynde
Some kindes agayne then let hym finde
Let him haue some furderaunce

  +Wyll.+ By god sir and I durst be so bolde
Arquaintance of this man clayme I would
and kynred to, yf the trouth were tolde
we be of one consanguynitie

  +Health+ How fo? let me here that I pray thee hartly

  +Wyll.+ Wyl and lybertyeis, of aunciterie olde
with out lyberfye, wili dare not bebolde                             320
And where wyl lacketh, lybertye is full colde
Thyrfore wyl and lybertye must nedes be of kyn.

  +liberti.+ In dede as he saythe it may well be
For wyl euer longeth vnto lybrtye
Therfore good freende welcome to me
I praye you al be good to him And goeth out

  +Welth.+ For your sake he is welcome to vs all
Let him come to our place ano than he shall
Haue succoure of vs and helpe withal
& now we wil depart. And welth & helth goth out.                     330

  +Wyll.+ Wyl ye go hence. I thanke ye masters with al my hert
I wyl seke you out I warrant you feare not
Now they be gone I am glad by saint mary
A lyttel while heare I purpose to tary
How to deceyue welth, helth, and libertie
Now must I deuyse.
  For I am a chylde that is pas grace
Ilwyll I am called that in euery place
Doth much mischiefe this is a playne case
Uertue I doo vtterly dispise,                                        340
  But if they wyst what I were
Then of my purpose I should be neuer [the] nere
I wyl kepe my tonge leste that I mar
My whole intent and wyll.
But now I meruayle by this day
Where shrewd wit is gone a stray
Some crafty touche is in his way
I here him, peace, stand styll.

       Entreth shrewd wyt with a songe.

 Dieu vous garde playsaunce                                         350
On seuen or no mumchaunce, what yonkers dare auaunce
To playe a grote or twaine.
  Loe heare I haue in store
Two or three grotes and no more
I take great thought therfore
For to kepe it, it is much payne
  I come now out of a place
where is a company of small grace
Theues and hores that spendes a pace
They were dronken all the sorte.                                     360
One of their purces I did aspy
Out of his sleue where it dyd lye
And one wynked on me with his eye
But ther began the sporte
  Their false falsehode, and I crafty wyt
got the purse loe, heare I haue it
I ran my way and let hym syt
Smoke and shitten arse together.
  And yf that I had yll wyll here
with this money we wolde make good chere                             370
Gentle brother wyll, I pray the apeare
For thou art in some corner.

  +Wytte+ I woulde come in but I am a fearde
Least that I be taken by the bearde
Wyth some catchepol, I haue heard
How thou haste stollen a purse

  +wylle+ Thou horson art thou mad, cum in I say
This is not the fyrste hazard that I haue scaped
yf I make an hand to decke my felfe gay
what am I the worse.                                                 380

  +wyll+ From thy company I cannot abyde
I must nedes holde upon thy syde

For they will be together.

Peace for gods body who cummeth there

Thus I shred wet, wyll euer be doinge

In this realme, he hath geeat actortty                               450

Many thinges he hach wrought

Willing to fulfil his soueraines commaundement
He is not fraide to do right punishment
Therfore of him I am afrayde

Of you thre specially, and of duetie
Great payne and busines as for mine owne
For you I haue taken because I loue you hartely
To maintaine you is all my desyre and faculty

And many be so wilfull, they will not be reformable.                 540

To stryue againe England, or any right with holde.

Specially [the] grace of god, which is our chief forderace
  If there be any that wyll grudge, surmyce or doo
Againe welth, helth & libertie, then must I for [the] same

And they begone home come away apare

  +Wytte.+ Nay by god not so hastie
A lytle whyle we wyll larye
Good euen syr to you mary
Dwell ye in this place?                                              620

  +Remdi+ Nay good fellowe I dwel not heare
Wherefore doest thou chat inquire:
Woldest thou ought with any heare
Speake be not afryde

  +Wyll.+ By God I would I had your gowne
And were a myle without the towne
Theron & woulde borowe a crowne
It is I that so sayde

  +Wytte.+ Hew lookest thou one him halfe a scorne
I p=omise you he is a scant gentylman borne                          630
What sstyest thou in his face

  +Remdi+ For somwhat in his face I lok e
In dede his mastership standes a crooke
For false shrewes both of you I tooke
And chyldren that be past grace.

  +Wyll.+ I wyll swere for hym, as tor this yeares twenty
that he hath ben euer as true as I
yet sometyme he will steale and make a lye
He is of my alyaunce.

  +Remdi+ In good fayth the same thinke I                            640
That ye be both lyke, full unthrifty
Syrs how do ye lyue, shew me quickly
Or I shall put you in duraunce

  +wytte.+ How liue we? mary our meate
Cummest thou hether for to threte:
So lowly syr wittam doth speake
From whence doth he come can ye shewe

  +Wyll.+ What dost thou ayle canst thou tell?
Hast thou any thing with vs to mell?
By the masse thy handes doth tykell                                  650
Thou shalt beare me a blowe.

  +remedi+ you false theues I know ye well
I shall let your purpose euey deale
yllwyll, and shrewd wit, the deuyll of hell
Take ye both for me.

Call vs but wit, and wyll, adde no more thereto,
yf thou doest thou were as good no
We shall handle you shrewdly

  +Remdi+ Syrs farewell here I wil no longer abide                   660
For you both shortly I wyll prouide
That all your falfe craft shalbe out tryed
And our subtillitie knowen and goeth out.

  +wytte.+ To go so soone the horson was wyse
therfore some now I must deuise
that each man may welth, helth and libertidespise
Or els he wyll marre all our mateer.
Brother wet, ler me alone
When they come you shal see me a none
Complayne of him, vnto them echone                                   670
And put him out of fauour

  +Wytte+ Peace no mo wordes, for they come yonder

How doth all our houshold, with them what chere?
Is euery thiag in order there
Afirr our intente?

  +wyll.+ ye syr they be all mery and glad
With reuell and rout somtime they be mad
Pipe whore hop theef, euery knaue and drabe
Is at our commaundement.                                             680

                        Helth turneth hym.

  What do ye say, then ye are to blame
And we put you in trust for the same
To kepe such rule, it is a shame
I tis not for our honour.

  +wytte.+ By the masse ihe horson doth lye
There is no such rule by gods body
A man may breke his neck as lyghtly
As his fast in your kechin, or seller truly.

                        Liberty turneth him                     690

  With that nother I am not content
I wolde there should be liberalitie compet[=e]t
And with honesti it is conoenient
That our neighbour fare the better

  +Wyll.+ you be angey with all that we haue done
Cum away brother let us go hens soone
I know a new maister wher we shalbe welcume
God be with you gentyl maister

  +Welth.+ Why wil ye begone tor a worde
Peraduenture we did but boorde                                       700
Me thinke ye should your mayster foorde
For to speake my minde.

  +wytte+ Nay nay, I can tel what was the matter
Remedy was here, and he dyd flatter
ye trust he more than vs and better
But marke the ende, what ye shal find

  +Health+ With good remedy we spake in dede
To folow his counsel we had neede
He warned vs that we should take hede
Of excesse and prodigalitie.                                         710

  +Wytte+ I meruayle ye speake so of good remedy
It is I that can do more than he
Wyt can make shyft at necessity
When Remedi cannot be hearde
  I know some that hath this thousand yere
Sought god remedy and yet neuer rhe nere
wit can put remedy by, yea this is cleare
For wit is a crafty lad.

  +Wyll.+ And wyl is an vngracious stay
Wyl hath doone many thinges men say                                  720
And yf ye let wit and wil goe his way
ye wil repent it soone.

  +liberty+ Why what cause haue you to go your way
ye shall abyde wich vs though you say nay
I wyl folow wyl, and wit alway
And so I haue euer done

  +wytte.+ yf I wist al my masters wolde so do
Then from your seruyce I wolde not goo
Speake now whether ye wyl or no
And let vs know your minde                                           730

  +Health+ Syrs ye be welco me to me playne
And for your company I am full fayne

  +Health+ I pray you let vs go, wherfore do we byde styll.

                        and goeth out

  +Remdi+ As touching my first purpose hither I am com again
I trow ye know me, good remedy is my name
That euery day doth take great .abor or payne                        740
To amende all faultes, I am chosen to the same
yf any mans conscience here doth grudge or shame
Hauing in him self remorse, & mendes in tyme & space
I am good remedy, and god is ful of mercy and grace
Therfore I wyl stand asyde, & a lyttel whyle remaine
Of welth, Helth and Lybertye, for to inquire
How they be ordred, and yf any man complayne

Nede constraineth me, for remedy I wold haue faine

Glad I am to remedy any man, that is affirmity

  Therfore I am wel worthi to be punished & blamed
Because I haue not folowed your co[=u]sel, but al thing
may be suffered saue welth.

  +Remdy+ Are you helth, this maketh me very pensife and sad
ye t be of good chere, & show how you were infect
To remedy you and succour you I wold be very glad
For god wyl punish the people when they be detelt

  +Health+ Syr I thanke god therof for wel worthy I am
My conscience doth iudge, some trouble haue I must                   800
A mendes I wyl make to god and if I can
Wil ad wit hath deceiued me in them I put my trust.

  +Remdi+ yf thou haue doone amisse, and be sory therfore
Then helfe a mendes is made, for that is contrission
Let that passe, now wil I axe you one thyng more
Wher be welth ad Libertie, be they of good disposicio

  +Health+ As for welth is fallen in decay, and neceslitie
By wast & war, thorow ytt wyll, and shrewdwit
And lybertie is kept in duraunce and captiuite
God helpe vs all, and sende vs good remedy for it                    810

  +Remdi+ For to heare this tale it maketh my hart heauie
yet be of good cofort, god is ful of grace, & I am good

  +Health+  Sir, th[=e] I besech you help vs in the way of charity

  +Remdi+ I would fayne but I cannot tel which way to begin
Except I might catch wil & wit, then I trow I could
Tye th[=e] shorter, for they destroy welth, helth & liberty bi sin
yf I had [the] theues, punish th[=e] extremly I wole.

  +Health+ You may soone catch them, if ye wil stande a syde
From this place they two, wyl not longe abide.

  +Remdi+ Me thinketh I here them com, helpe to holde th[=e] fast    820

                        will turneth

  +Wyll.+ Cum in wit for herc is no body
We may ve bolde and talke largely
Our hartes to eafe ano shew plainly
What we haue doone.

  +wytte+ I must nedes laugh I cannot forbeare
To remember warre that knaue wil ye heare
The horson fleming was beshitten for feare
Because he should boyde so soone.

  +Wyll.+ Herke now do I meruayle by this bread
For I weae surely uhat hrlth be dead                                 830
I saw saw him go with a kercher on his head
As he should go at hangyng.

  +wytte+ Harke in thine Eare, yf tste horson hap
To complayne to him that weres the red cap
I feare then shortly he wyl us clap
By the heles from our liuingl

  +Wyll.+ Nay nay, there is no doubt
By hym I haue reported all about
That he doth not wel, his good name to put out
ylwyl cannot say wel,                                                840

  +remedi.+ Frende therin thou art the more to blam
Co staunder me wrongfully, and vndesrrued
But or thou drpart thou shalt answere for the same,
wher is Welth & liberty, how hast thou th[=e] ordred?

  +Wyll+ Qury cicis quest is vn malt ombre
Me is vn spy&nardo compoco parlauere.

  +Health+ Thou folse chefe is thine English tonge gone
as mischeuo[us] il wil & shrewdwit, ye haue destroyd ma ni on

  +Wytte.+ Sir hurt not me, & I wiltel you trouth anone
This same ia as false a knaue as euer cam [with]in saint Ioh[=e]s    850

  +wyll.+ Per amor de my as peca vn poco
Eo queris and ar pour lagraunt creae so

  +Remdy+ I can not tel what thou dost meae blabbler
But [thou] shalt speake English & confesse an other mater,

  +Health+ Syr I besech your lordship, in the way of charity
Let not fhese thefes escape your hands they haue destroyed
us utterly.

  +wytte:+ Syr, beleue hym not he speakes but of malice onely
we be true men, therof we shall fetch good witnes
An honest man that shalbe bound for him and me                       860
The law sayth plaine, nulla fides contra testes

  +Remdi+ that is trouth, but who wilbe witnes or bo[=u]d for the

  +Wyll.+ There is three amonge you in this howse
I Iyfgo to fetch them quickly

  +Wytte.+ They wil come vns[=e]d for I warant you if they wyst

  +Remd+ what be theyr names, tel me what they be,

  +Wyll.+ That on is Iohn Irische abd Iohn sholer
But ful these be honest men all three

  +Health+ Trust not their wordes they wyll dessemble styll
They are so false and crafty, all theyr intent is yll.               870

  +Wyll.+ ye lye falsely I fpeake but right and reason
And by the law of armes ye must nedes be tane
you are called good remedy which at al feason
Sholde leaue to mans lyfe, and maintaine the same
we be here both your prisoners wrongfully accused bi defame
Kepe one of vs fast let him lye for all
That other for frendes and wytnes goo shall.

  +wytte,+ Syr let hym not goo and leue me behynde
He wyl euer be a false knaue, for I know his mynde

  +Wyll.+ Holde thy tonge folish knaue I do not meane so             880

  +Remdt+ I here now ye cannot agre, which of you should go

  +Wyll.+ No by gods body there shall none go but I

  +Wytte.+ Thou playest the knaue it must nedes be I

  +Health+ Kepe them safe I pray you for yf they scap againe
Many men shal repent it, it shalbe to our payne

  +Remdi+ They be here yet, to kepe them fast is myne intent,
Haue them away both to prison in continent.

  +wyll.+ Lo false knaue this is for thy crafty wif.
Now fast by the heeles we are lake to syt.

  +Wytte.+ I am content so that I may haue compeny                   890
yf I shold behanged, I wold be haged honest

                        & goth out

  +Remdi+ Go hence with them & bring welth & liberty.

  +helth,+ Com away ye theues, now I shals kepe you surely,

                        & goth out

  +Wyll.+ Lock vs vp & kepe vs as fast as ye can
yet yll wyl and shrewdwit shalbe with many a man.

  +Remdi+ I am halfe ashamed, that long it hath ben sayd
That noble men by such wretches hath ben deceiued
they did reioyce and iest, and were very well apaide
Trusting to scape cleare, and styl for to haue rained
But now they shall not so, let them be wel assured                   900
That ylwyl and shrewde wyt shal haue but yl rest
For wheresoeuer they be I wyll breake theyr nest

  +wealth+ In the honour of god we aske you forgeuenes althre
we ought to be ashamed to looke you in the face
By our foly & negligence, we haue done so vnwisely
we were fowle deceyued, we put vs to your grace
Thys shaibe a good warding for vs alonge space
whan man is wel punished then he wyl beware
who that knoweth what nede is, wel after drede care

  +Remdi+ I may not blame you gretly for by mine owne reaso          910
I know ylwyl and shrewdwit deceiueth great & smal
yf ye can remabre thys. and beware a nother season
This is a good example and lerning to you all
Now serue god and loue him, & for grace euer call
And ylwyl and shrewdewyt, from you I shall abstaine
ye haue vsed them to longe to your domage and pain.

  +health.+ Forsoth syr ye sai trouth, they did vs great displesur
Full hard it is to vanquishe the vngrocious ylwyl
He is so croked, by flattery, dissulation & such other
Mannes mynd is so variable, & glad to report yl                      920
I feare many one yet wolde haue him raine styll
For some vnto their owne wyl hath so much affection
yet the devyl and yl wyl is both of one complexion

  +liberty=+ yll wyll is nought, but worse is shrewdwyt
For he contryueth al subtil ymanginacien
yt were vnpossyble for a man els to doo it
shrewdwyt breweth myscef, & false conspyracion
He hath put me lyberty in prison, ad great tribulacion
if it had not bene for your good remedi & forbera[=u]ce
I & other [that] hath libertie, shold haue b[=e] in duraunce.        930

  +Remdi+ Be al of good chere, and haue no mistrust
The ende of yl wyl and shrewd wyt is but shame
Though they reygne a while, wrongfully and uniust
yet truth wyll appeare and their misdedes blame
Then wronge is subdued, and good remedy tane
Though falsehod cloke, and hide his matters all
Craft wyll out and disceite wyll haue a fall
  Whereas ye are now, in distresse all three
Neare were ye brought in case lyke to marre
Now haue ye no doubt, yf ye wyll be ruled after me                   940
I shal rcstore ye agayne as well as euer ye were
Welth kepe styll this realme, looke ye stray not farre
And Helth be of good chere, your disease I can soone m[=e]de
Liberty now ye be released do no more offend,

  +wealth+ Now let vs al thake god [that] good remedy hath sende
Trust to hym only for his grace and goodnes
we are forgiuenes of our trespas I trust we wil am[=e]d
And cleane forsake syn, foly, and unthriftines
th[us] we wil here coclude, soueraine of your graciousnes
we besech you to remyt our negligence, & misbehauor                  950
There we haue sayd amis, we comit al to your fauor

  +Health+ And for your preseruacion hartely we wyl pray
your realme to increase, with ioy and tranquility
That welth, helth & liberty, may continue here alway
By the ouersight and aide of him that is good remdy
which willingly doth his deuer, vnder your actoritye
As parte here apereth your purpose to maintaine
God rontinue his goodnes, that longe he may riagne

  +Remdi+ Iesu preserue quene Elizabeth,
            [that] noble pr[=i]cis worthy
Iesu continue her helth long for to endure                           960
Iesu indue her w vertue grace & honour
Iesu maintaine the lords of [the] co[=u]sel
            to execute good remedi euer
Iesu spede and helpe al them gods honour to further
Iesu increase the comunaltie to prosper and doo wel.

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
