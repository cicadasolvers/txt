A WORD TO THE LITERARY MEN OF ENGLAND.

    "_Twenty scholars in seven years might retrieve the worst losses we
    experience from the bigotry of popes and califs._ I do not intend to
    assert that every Herculanean manuscript might, within that period, be
    unfolded; but the three first legible sentences might be; which is
    quite sufficient to inform the intelligent reader whether a farther
    attempt on the scroll would repay his trouble. _There are fewer than
    thirty Greek authors worth inquiring for; they exist, beyond doubt, and
    beyond doubt they may, by attention, patience, and skill, be brought to
    light._ * * With a _smaller_ sum than is annually expended on the
    appointment of some silly and impertinent young envoy, we might restore
    _all_, or _nearly all_ those writers of immortal name, whose
    disappearance has been the regret of genius for four entire centuries.
    In my opinion, a _few thousand pounds_, laid out on such an
    undertaking, would be laid out as creditably as on a Persian carpet or
    a Turkish tent."--Landor's _Imaginary Conversations--Southey and
    Porson--Works_, vol. i. p. 20.

I call upon the literary men of England, upon the English government, and
upon the public, to set the example in a glorious expedition, which, even
in this age of wonders, is one of no little importance and magnitude. I
conjure them to bear in mind the words I have placed at the head of this
article,--the opinion of one of our best and most delightful authors. This
opinion Mr. Landor, veiled under the eidolon of Porson, I feel assured,
does not hold alone; I believe it to be engraven on the "red-leaved
tablets" of the hearts of many more learned and more distinguished scholars
than myself, who am but as the trumpet which is to rouse the friends of
classical literature to action; as the bell which awakens the reaper to his
abundant harvest: but I will sustain, that on none of them is it cut more
deeply or more inextinguishably than on mine.

I propose that the friends of Classical, Scandinavian, and Oriental
literature form themselves into an Association for the Rescue of the many
ancient MSS. in the Greek, Latin, Anglo-Saxon, Norwegian, Zend, Sanscrit,
Hebrew, Abyssinian, Ethiopian, Hindostanee, Persian, Syriac, Arabic,
Armenian, Coptic, Turkish, and Chinese languages:--that application be made
to government for the pecuniary furtherance of this enterprise;--and that
the active co-operation of all foreign literary men be secured.[1]

Thus a careful and untiring search may be entered upon in all the regions
of the earth where any MSS. are likely to be found, and the recovery or
loss of the many inestimable authors of antiquity be made certain. Let the
libraries of Europe be examined strictly and inquisitorially (and this will
not be a heavy expense), and the new accessions to classical literature
printed, the MSS. {162} which present themselves of already known authors
carefully examined, and the variations to the received text marked. How
much this is wanted we experience in the corruptions of Sophocles,
AEschylus, Thucydides, Plato, and Aristoteles! In this way much that is
valuable may be recovered; much that is matter of discussion set at rest.
Let me instance the Babrian fables, and the discovery of Mr. Harris at
Alexandria; who, it was remarked to me, might have discovered the whole,
instead of a part, had proper hands unfolded the mummy.

On the advantages of this search, it were useless to expatiate: every one
is sensible of it, and, sooner or later, it _must_ occur. Let us not allow
our grandchildren to surpass us in everything, but let us set about this
ourselves. Monstrous as the idea seems, it is simple of execution.

I will not take up the space so kindly afforded me by the Editor of "NOTES
AND QUERIES" with speculation. The Association should be composed of a
Literary Section and a Business Section: the first to be under the
administration of a President and an efficient Board of Examiners, to look
into literary matters, and examine and appoint the proper officers of the
Investigation Parties; which parties must be composed of clever,
adventurous, hardy, and adroit men, obtaining the assistance of the natives
wherever they may be carrying on their researches; the Second Section to be
under the direction of a Chairman and Finance Committee, to which the
officers of the subordinate departments render their accounts.

I know not whether more will be required of me on this subject; very likely
not: but I reserve much that I could say, until that time. I have now only
to thank the Editor for inserting this long, but I will not say, wholly
uninteresting proposal.

THE ESSAY ON SATIRE.

Dryden, as sir Walter Scott observes, left a name in literature "second
only to those of Milton and Shakspere"; but, popular as his writings were,
he gave no collective edition of his poetical or dramatic works. The
current editions of his poems may therefore be open to censure, both on the
score of deficiency and redundancy--and such I believe to be the fact.

An _Essay on satire_, itself a coarse satire, has been ascribed to him for
more than a century on dubious authority, and the correctness of this
ascription has been properly suggested as a question for examination.

We have to decide on the credibility of two opposite statements, as made in
the publications about to be enumerated:--

    1. "The works of John Sheffield, earl of Mulgrave, marquis of Normanby,
    and duke of Buckingham. LONDON: printed for John Barber, 1723. 4º. 2
    vols."

    2. "The works of John Sheffield, earl of Mulgrave, marquis of Normanby,
    and duke of Buckingham. Printed for John Barber, alderman of LONDON,
    1726. Small 8º. 2 vols."

    3. "Original poems and translations, by John Dryden, Esq. LONDON:
    printed for J. and R. Tonson, 1743. 12º. 2 vols."

In the two former publications, the poem appears as the entire composition
of the noble author, and is said to have been "written in the year 1675."
In the latter publication it appears without date, and is said to be "by
Mr. Dryden and the earl of Mulgrave."

The publications were posthumous, and as the editors afford no explanation
of the point in dispute, we must consult the reputed authors.

In the year 1691, as an advertisement to _King Arthur_, a dramatic opera,
Dryden printed a catalogue of his "plays and poems in quarto," in order to
prevent future mis-ascriptions. The catalogue comprises ten poems, but no
_Essay on satire_. The publisher of _King Arthur_ was Mr. Jacob Tonson.

In 1682, the earl of Mulgrave published, anonymously, through the agency of
Mr. Joseph Hindmarsh, an _Essay upon poetry_. It contains these lines:--

 "The laureat here may justly claim our praise,
  Crown'd by _Mac-Fleckno_ with immortal bays;
  Though prais'd and punish'd for another's rimes,
  His own deserve that glorious fate sometimes,
  Were he not forc'd to carry now dead weight,
  Rid by some lumpish minister of state."

In 1717, Mr. Tonson published _Poems by the earl of Roscommon_; and added
thereto the _Essay on poetry_, "with the leave and with the corrections of
the author." The lines shall now be given in their amended state, as they
appear in that volume, with the accompanying notes:--

 "The _Laureat_[2] here may justly claim our praise,
  Crown'd by _Mack-Fleckno_[3] with immortal bays;
  Tho' _prais'd_ and _punish'd_ once for other's[4] rhimes,
  His own deserve as great applause sometimes;
  Yet _Pegasus_[5], of late, has born _dead weight_,
  Rid by some _lumpish_ ministers of state."

Next to Dryden and the earl of Mulgrave, as authorities on this question,
comes the elder Jacob Tonson. Both writers were contributors to his
_Poetical miscellanies_. In 1701 he published _Poems on various occasions,
etc. By Mr. John Dryden_. The volume has not the _Essay on satire_. The
same {163} Tonson, as we have just seen, gave currency to the assertion
that Dryden was "ignorant of the whole matter."

To this display of contemporary evidence must be added the information
derivable from the posthumous publications enumerated in the former part of
this article. The publication of 1723 was made by direction of the duchess
of Buckingham. The couplet, "Tho' prais'd," &c., and the appended note,
were omitted. In 1726 Mr. alderman Barber republished the volumes "with
several additions, and without any castrations," restoring the couplet and
note as they were printed in 1717. In the _Original poems_ of Dryden, as
collectively published in 1743, the joint authorship is stated without a
word of evidence in support of it.

If we turn to the earlier writers on Dryden, we meet with no facts in
favour of his claim to the poem in question. Anthony a Wood says, "the earl
of Mulgrave was generally thought to be the author." This was written about
1694. The reverend Thomas Birch, a man of vast information, repeated this
statement in 1736. Neither Congreve nor Giles Jacob allude to the poem.

The witnesses on the other side are, 1. The publisher of the _State poems_.
2. Dean Lockier. And 3. The reverend Thomas Broughton.

The _State poems_, in which the essay is ascribed to Dryden, may be called
a surreptitious publication: it carries no authority. The testimony of
Lockier, which is to the same effect, was never published by himself. It
was a scrap of conversation held thirty years after the death of Dryden,
and reported by another from memory. The reverend Thomas Broughton, who
asserts the joint authorship of the poems, cites as his authority the
_Original poems_, &c. Now Kippis assures us that he edited those volumes.
On the question at issue, he could discover no authority but himself!

Dryden _may_ have revised the _Essay on satire_. Is that a sufficient
reason for incorporating it with his works? Do we tack to the works of Pope
the poems of Wycherly and Parnell? We have authority for stating that Pope
revised the _Essay on poetry_. Is it to be added to the works of Pope? Be
it as it may, the poem was published, in substance, six years before Pope
was born!

As the evidence is very brief, there can be no necessity for
recapitulation; and I shall only add, that if about to edit the poetical
works of Dryden, I should reject the _Essay on satire_.

MACKLIN'S ORDINARY AND SCHOOL OF CRITICISM.

Mr. George Wingrove Cooke, in his valuable work, _The History of Party_
(vol. iii, p. 66.), gives an admirable sketch of the life of Edmund Burke.
Speaking of his early career, and of the various designs which he formed
for his future course, we are told that "at _Macklin's Debating Society_ he
made the first essay of his powers of oratory."

Mr. Cunningham, in his _Handbook for London_, speaks of Macklin delivering
Lectures on Elocution at Pewterer's Hall (p. 394.), and of his residence in
Tavistock Row, Covent Garden (p. 484.); but he does not mention _Macklin's
Debating Society_. I imagine that by this "Debating Society" is meant an
_Ordinary and School of Criticism_, which that eminent actor established in
the year 1754, in the Piazza, Covent Garden. Mr. W. Cooke, in his _Life of
Macklin_, 1806, p. 199., says--

    "What induced him [Macklin] to quit the stage in the full vigour of
    fame and constitution, was one of those schemes which he had long
    previously indulged himself in, of suddenly making his fortune by the
    establishment of a tavern and coffee-house in the Piazza, Covent
    Garden; to which he afterwards added a school of oratory, upon a plan
    hitherto unknown in England, founded upon the Greek, Roman, French, and
    Italian Societies, under the title of _The British Inquisition_."

The first part of this plan (the public ordinary) was opened on the 11th of
March, 1754; and an amusing account of its operations may be found in
Angelo's _Pic Nic_, p. 32. The second part of "Macklin's mad plan," as it
was then termed, "The British Inquisition," commenced proceedings on the
21st of November in the same year; and here, according to the first
advertisement, "such subjects in Arts, Sciences, Literature, Criticism,
Philosophy, History, Politics, and Morality, as shall be found useful and
entertaining to society, will be lectured upon and freely debated."

"LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST (Act II. Scene 1.).

    "It is odd that Shakspeare should make Dumain inquire after Rosaline,
    who was the mistress of Biron, and neglect Katharine, who was his own.
    Biron behaves in the same manner.--Perhaps _all_ the ladies wore
    masks.--STEEVENS.

    "They certainly did."--MALONE.

    "And what if they did?"--QUERY.

In what possible way can the circumstance of the ladies _wearing masks_
lessen the inconsistency pointed out by Steevens?

Rosaline has been immediately singled out by her former admirer--

    "Did I not dance with you in Brabant once?"

--a circumstance quite inconsistent with uncertain identity afterwards.

But if the gentlemen really did mistake the identity of their ladies,
Boyet's answers must have misled them into a similar mistake in _their
names_: so that the natural consequence would have been, that each lover
would afterwards address his {164} poetical effusion _nominally_ to the
wrong lady! which does not appear to have been the case.

Therefore, even if the masking be admitted, it can in no way lessen the
inconsistency of the cross questions, which to me appears to have arisen
from a most palpable instance of clerical or typographical transposition.

Steevens was on the right scent, although he rejected it in the same
breath, when he said,--

    "No advantage would be gained by _an exchange of names_, because the
    last speech is determined to Biron by Maria, who gives a character of
    him after he has made his exit."

This is a good reason against a transposition in the _male_ names, but it
is none whatever against the same occurrence in the ladies' names; and
consequently it is there that the true solution of the difficulty must be
sought.

If we admit that a substitution may have occurred, of "Rosaline" for
"Katharine," in Boyet's answer to Dumain, and _vice versa_ in his answer to
Biron, all difficulty disappears at once.

The completeness with which the idea of transposition not only accounts for
the existence of the error, but at the same time suggests the manner in
which it may be corrected, ought of itself to secure its reception, even if
it were not corroborated in a very singular way by the following collateral
circumstance.

It may be observed that Boyet points out two of the ladies, not only by
name, but also by styling them "heirs;" one of Falconbridge, the other of
Alencon. Now in their previous descriptions of their respective lovers, one
of the ladies (Maria) says she had met Longaville at a marriage of a
"Falconbridge;" another lady (Katharine) says she had met Dumain at "Duke
Alencon's." When, therefore, we find that Boyet, in reply to Longaville's
question, designates _Maria_ as "heir of Falconbridge," it is in direct
analogy that he should, in answer to Dumain's question, designate
_Katharine_ as "heir of Alencon;" but, in consequence of the transposition
of names, Boyet appears, as the text now stands, to confer that
designation, not upon Katharine, but upon Rosaline, whom Biron had met at
Brabant!

There can be no doubt, therefore, that the names of Katharine and Rosaline
have been transposed _contrary to the author's intention_, and the only
wonder is--not that such a very commonplace error should have been
committed--but that it should have been suffered to remain through so many
editions up to the present time.

NOTES ON NEWSPAPERS.

I send you the following, as a help to "Materials for a satisfactory
History of Newspapers," alluded to in the last volume of "NOTES AND
QUERIES," p. 375.

I have in my possession some old newspapers, ranging from 1691 to 1694,
entitled _A Collection for Improvement of Husbandry and Trade_, edited by
John Houghton, F.R.S., St. Bartholomew Lane, behind the Royal Exchange,
London. The size is a small folio, published weekly, generally every
Friday. It was carried on for some time merely as a single leaf, with no
advertisements. In this form, the editor says--

    "These papers are 2d. each here, and anybody may have them by the post.
    But where that is thought too much, it may be eased by ten or twelve
    obliging themselves constantly to take them from a bookseller,
    coffee-man, or some other, who may afford to pay a carrier, and sell
    them there for 2d., or at most 3d.; or carriers themselves may gain
    well, if they'll serve the country gentlemen. And any such bookseller,
    coffee-man, or carrier, that will apply themselves to me, shall have
    good encouragement, with liberty to return those that won't sell."

Ultimately the editor determined on admitting advertisements. He then
doubled the size of his paper, making it two leaves instead of one. In
reference to this increased size he says,--

    "My collection I shall carry on as usual. This part is to give away;
    and those who like it not, may omit the reading. I believe it will help
    on trade, particularly encourage the advertisers to increase the vent
    of my papers. I shall receive all sorts of advertisements, but shall
    answer for the reasonableness of none; unless I give thereof a
    particular character, on which (as I shall give it) may be dependence,
    but no argument that others deserve not as well."

    "I am inform'd that great numbers of gazettes are each time printed,
    which makes them the most universal intelligencers; but I'll suppose
    mine their first handmaid, because it goes (tho' not so thick, yet) to
    most parts. It's also lasting, to be put into volumes with indexes; and
    particularly there shall be an index of all the advertisements,
    whereby, for ages to come, they may be useful. I have publish'd on the
    subject of Husbandry and Trade, two quarto volumes, three folio
    volumes, with the great sheet of taxes, acres, houses, &c.; and am
    weekly carrying on this paper, which may be brought to anybodies house
    within the Bills of Mortality, or penny post, for one penny the week;
    and anywhere else in England (where enough will encourage a bookseller
    or carrier). The volumes may be had from most booksellers of England,
    Scotland, or Ireland."

The Collection, which the editor will carry on as usual, refers to the
single sheet. The Gazette must have been the London Gazette. In what sort
of way the editor could suppose that advertisements could be useful for
ages to come, we, in this age of enlightenment and knowledge, are at a loss
to conceive. The great sheet of taxes, acres, houses, &c., I have, and may
give you an account of its contents at some future time. The first page
{165} of the paper was always devoted to a letter from the editor's own pen
on husbandry, trade, chemistry, domestic cookery, and a variety of other
topics. The editor appears to have been a spirited man, who collected with
great care and diligence a great variety of facts whereby to interest his
readers. The advertisements are very curious, specimens of which I will
give you in another communication. Each paper contains the weekly prices of
wheat, rye, barley, malt, oats, horse beans, peas, coals, hops, hay,
tallow, and wool, in all the counties of England and Wales; the prices of
provisions in London; also a weekly statement of wind and weather; the
number of deaths, and their causes; the number of christenings and burials,
specifying how many of each sex. The editor often concludes a column of
information by stating, "this is all I see useful to posterity." He not
only appears to have been a man of an active mind, but also a very kind
man; for he says to those who advertise in his paper for situations, &c.,
that "if they apply themselves to me, I'll strive to help them." He appears
also to have kept a shop, or at least to have traded in certain articles:
for in one of his papers is this advertisement:--

    "In my first volume of 1682, I publish'd my own selling of chocolate,
    and have sold in small quantities ever since: I have now two sorts,
    both made of the best nuts, without spice or perfume; the one 5s., and
    the other 6s. the pound; and I'll answer for their goodness. If I shall
    think fit to sell any other sorts, I'll give notice.

    JOHN HOUGHTON."

By this advertisement we get at the date when the paper was first
published.

_Manuel du Libraire_ of M. J. C. Brunet in reply to my inquiry who was the
author of the original history. It is taken from tom. i. p. 544.

    "Histoire du V. et du N. Testament (par Dav. Martin), enrichie de plus
    de 400 fig. Anvers (Antwerp.), P. Mortier, 1700, 2 vol. gr. in fol."

M. Brunet informs us that copies of these volumes are valued by the state
of the plates; one of which, in the Apocalypse, having been broken, was
mended with nails, which marked the impression, and gave the distinction of
copies before or with the nails.

As there can be no doubt but that most booksellers take in your useful
publication, one of them may be induced to inform the undersigned if he has
a copy for sale, and the price.

Minor Notes.

_Origin of Harlequins._--In a note to his translation of Priscus' "History
of the Embassy sent to Attila by Theodosius the Younger" (_Hist. Civiliz._
app. iii. vol. ii. p. 430., Bogue's edit. European Library), M. Guizot
remarks, alluding to the appearance of Zercho, a Moor, at Attila's feast:

    "Is it not singular to find an harlequin at the court of Attila? Yet
    such is the origin of these buffoons. The colour of the black slaves,
    the strangeness of their face and manners, caused them to be sought
    after as excellent ministers of mirth; to complete the singularity,
    Zercho asks his wife at the hands of Attila, closely paralleling
    Harlequin demanding Columbine."

Is this account of the origin of Harlequins generally acquiesced in? I
should be obliged by any early notice of the character of Harlequin, and
his introduction on the English or any foreign stage.

_Monosyllables_.--Among the many correspondents who have sent you specimens
of monosyllabic poetry, I have seen no one who has quoted this very
singular passage from Phineas Fletcher's _Purple Island_. It is _far more
striking_ than anything you have yet inserted on this subject.

              Canto I. Stanza 7.
 "New light new love, new love new life hath bred;
      A life that lives by love, and loves by light;
    A love to Him to whom all loves are wed;
      A light to whom the sun is darkest night:
    Eye's light, heart's love, soul's only life He is;
    Life, soul, love, heart, light, eye, and all are His;
  He eye, light, heart, love, soul; He all my joy and bliss."

In seventy words only _one_ of more than a syllable; the alliteration in
the second line is likewise noticeable.

_The Breeches, or Geneva Bible_ (Vol. iii, p. 17.).--I have before me a
copy of Christopher Barkar's edition of the "Breeches" Bible, 1576, small
folio, in which, on the fly-leaf, is the following interesting note in the
handwriting of the late Francis Douce:--

    "It is generally conceived that the peculiarity, 'and they sewed fig
    tree leaves together, and made themselves breeches,' belongs
    exclusively to this Bible, but it is a mistake. The Saxon version of
    AElfric has, {166} '_and sewed fig-leaves, and worked them_ WEED-BREECH,
    _or cloaths for the breech._' Wicliffe also translates 'and maden hem
    _breechis_;' and it is singular that Littleton, in his excellent
    _Dictionary_, explains _perizomata_, the word used in the Vulgate, by
    _breeches_. In the manuscript French translation of Petrus Comestor's
    _Commentary on the Bible_, made by Guiars des Moulins in the 13th
    century, we have 'Couvertures tout autres-sint comme unnes petites
    _braies_.'"

_Etymology of Mushroom._--In the sixteenth century this word appears
generally to have been spelt _Mushrump_. Nares, in his valuable _Glossary_,
gives an instance from Marlow's play of _Edward the Second_, 1598; but
there is an earlier example in Robert Southwell's _Spirituall Poems_, 1595:

 "He that high growth on cedars did bestow,
  Gave also lowly _mushrumps_ leave to growe."

It is also spelt _Mushrump_ in Cockeram's _Dictionary_, 1632. These
instances may possibly lead to a correct etymology of the word.

EDWARD F. RIMBAULT.

_Curious Fact in Natural History._--There is in the Brazils a popular
superstition to this effect. There is a tree called Japecarga, which is
said to grow out of the body of the insect called Cigara. This is a very
large tree, and the Cigara is an insect which makes an incessant chirping
on the tree, and, as the saying goes, chirps till it bursts. When the
insect dies, the tree is said to grow out of it, the roots growing down the
legs. My explanation is this: The insect feeds on the seeds of the
Japecarga, and occasionally, under advantageous circumstances, some of the
seeds germinate, and cause the death of the insect, the tree shooting up
through the softest part, the back, and the rootlets making their way down
the only outlets, the legs. I wish to know whether any similar fact in
Natural History has been noticed, and if not, how is it accounted for,
since I can vouch for the skin of the insect having been found with the
tree growing out of its back, and the roots growing down through the legs.

_The Great Exhibition._--It is well known that the vineyards of Switzerland
have been long protected from hail by means of upright poles having copper
wire attached to them, termed "paragreles," distant from each other from 60
to 100 feet. The formation of hail is an effect of which electricity is the
cause, and the cloud being deprived of this agent by the conductors,
descends in the shape of rain. Mr. John Murray, F.S.A., F.L.S., &c., in his
work on Switzerland, speaks very decidedly of their utility. Has then this
ingenious contrivance been considered with reference to the protection of
the Great Exhibition and its valuable, or rather invaluable, contents? or
why is it deemed inapplicable to the purpose?

Queries.

THE TEN COMMANDMENTS.

Everybody can see that the first commandment is directed against
polytheism, and the second against idolatry; and most people know that the
Church of Rome differs from the Church of England in joining these two into
one commandment, and dividing the tenth into two commandments, so as to
make up the full number, ten. This point of difference betwixt the two
churches must necessarily have been the subject of much dispute. There must
be plausible reasons on both sides for every commandment in the Anglican
ritual being different from its correspondent on the Roman tables: and the
settlement of this question must properly belong to the theologian, since
holy scripture only mentions how many divine commandments there are
(Exodus, xxxiv. 28.; Deuteronomy, iv. 13., x. 4.), without authoritatively
separating them.

Will any one kindly inform me where this question may be found fully
discussed; and where mention is made of the earliest known divisions of the
law? Also, I should be glad to know how the Jews at the present day divide
the commandments; and whether there is any record or tradition of there
ever having been discussions in their church upon this very interesting and
no less important matter?

_Derivation of the Word Fib._--Can any of your readers suggest a proper
derivation of this word? Old Bailey, to whom a reference would occasionally
save many doubts and inquiries, connects it with "fable." Johnson says
nothing as to the etymology, but explains it as "a cant word among
children;" while, at the same time, he inserts it on the authority of Pope
and Arbuthnot.

In reading the works of that very learned and instructive author, Samuel
Werenfels, I was struck with a passage in his _Diatribe de Meteoris_, p.
272. (Amstel. Wetstein, 1702), which seemed to furnish a probable solution
of the question:--"Propter abusum nominis Phoebi evenit, ut omnes qui,
altius in oratione, quam decet, se extollere volunt, Gallis hodiernis
[Greek: phoibologein] Phoebum loqui, _Parler_ _Phebus_, dicantur." So far
as the sound is concerned, this seems a nearer approximation to "fib" than
the word "fable." The sense, too, is not _very_ remote from the accepted
one of "_talking fibs_." Query, as to this conjecture?

_Thomas May, the Author of the Supplement to Lucan._--Who was this Thomas
May? To an Elzevir edition of Lucan, 1658, Amsterdam, "accuranto Cornelio
Schrevelio," there is added "Supplementum Lucani Libri Septem; authore
Thoma Maio, Anglo." In the preface it is stated, "Supplementum Lucani ab
Anglo quodam antehac seorsim editum, et huic materiae aptissimum adjunximus,
ne quid esset quod hic desideraretur." In the fourth book of this
_Supplement_, Cato is represented as soliloquising before his death as
follows:--

 "Quam diversa, inquit, restant post funera sortes!
  Credo equidem, divine Plato, te dogmata vera
  Haec ipsum docuisse Deum. Deus ipse sequendam
  (Aut Natura homines ratioque innata fefellit)
  Proposuit virtutem, et praemia debita justis
  Haec quonian justos injusta potentia fraudat
  Saepius in terris, et gens humana rebellat
  Solvere post mortem justissimus ipse tenetur."

The famous soliloquy in Addison's _Cato_ seems to resemble this, in its
general tone of thought. In a former passage occur these lines:--

             "Solatia sola haec,
  Quod meliore frui post mortem lumine sperat.
  Immortalem animam spes haec probat."

The idea is similar to that contained in--

 "Else whence this pleasing hope, this fond desire,
  This longing after immortality?"

Addison seems to me to have had May's description of Cato's death in his
mind, when he wrote the soliloquy.

CARDINAL'S MONUMENT.

(Vol. iii., p. 106.)

Your correspondent and querist, J. D. A., asks for some information
respecting the coat of arms surmounted by a cardinal's hat, sculptured and
affixed to one of the pillars of the south transept in St. Saviour's
Church, Southwark. I send in reply an extract from a now scarce book,
Arthur Tiler's _History and Antiquities of St. Saviour's_, 1765, with which
all the later historians of the church agree:--

    "Anno 1400.   2 Hen. IV.

    "The whole church was new built about this time; Henry Beaufort (second
    son of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, son of Edward III.), Cardinal
    of St. Eusebius, and Bishop of Winchester from the year 1405 to the
    time of his death in 1447, might have contributed towards the building,
    being a man of great wealth, for which he was called the rich Cardinal,
    _as the arms of the Beauforts are carved in stone on a pillar in the
    south cross aisle; and by the remaining sculpture on each side it
    appears to be done for strings pendant from a Cardinal's hat placed
    over them_. The arms are quarterly France and England, a border compone
    argent and azure."

When the transepts were rebuilt, some years since, the cardinal's hat,
which till that time was nearly defaced, was then restored, and the coat of
arms newly emblazoned.

W. B.

  19. Winchester Place, St. Saviour's, Southwark.

    [G. A. S. and JAMES H. SMITH have forwarded similar replies.]

With reference to the Query of J. D. A. (p. 106. ante), it would appear
that the cardinal's hat, but with a difference in the number of rows of
tassels, is sometimes seen on the monuments of men who never were raised to
that dignity.

In the Cathedral of St. Canice, Kilkenny, are two monuments placed there
during the rule of the Confederate Catholics, viz., that of James Cleere,
"Protonotarius et Rector ecclesiae D. Joannis Dioecesis oporiensis," who
died A.D. 1643, Nov. 14; and David Rothe, intrusive Roman Catholic Bishop
of Ossery, who died some years after--on both of which the arms of the
individual are surmounted by a cardinal's hat. It is quite certain that
neither of these ecclesiastics had a right to this distinction _as
cardinals_. For the right of Bishops and Prothonotaries to wear hats or
caps of the same shape as the cardinals, with their colours and
peculiarities, see _Glossary of Heraldry_ (Oxford), under "Cap-Cardinals."
Any further examples will oblige

J. GRAVES.

  Kilkenny, Feb. 10. 1851.

The Cardinal's hat, with arms beneath, on a pillar near the poet Gower's
monument, in St. Saviour's, Southwark, refers directly to the beneficence
of that busy cardinal and very remarkable man, {170} Cardinal Beaufort,
Bishop of Winchester, and who in that capacity resided in the adjoining
palace; indirectly it refers to the marriage of James V. of Scotland with
Jane Beaufort, the Cardinal's niece: and it is something to the honour of
St. Mary Overies, (the church in question,) to add that it was within its
walls that the ceremony took place. Besides Gower, the parish registers
state that Edmond Shakspeare ob. 1607 (one of the brothers of the great
dramatist), John Fletcher ob. 1625, and Philip Massinger ob. 1640. (See Mr.
Knight's _Old England_, eng. 548. p. 147.)

BLOWEN.

A cardinal's hat is differenced by colour and the number of its tassels,
not by its shape, which is the same for all clergymen. Thus, for simple
priests, a black hat, with one tassel on either side; for a bishop, a green
hat with three tassels; for a cardinal, a crimson hat with five or seven
tassels. What the reason may be for the variation in the number of the
tassels amongst cardinals, I should be glad to learn.

W. D-N.

In Ciaconius (_Vitae et Res Gestae Pontificum_, Rome, 1630), there is a list
of all the cardinals created up to that date, with their armorial bearings;
and the only instances of France and England quarterly (which is, no doubt,
what is intended), are those of Cardinal Beaufort, Bishop of Winchester,
and Cardinal Hallum, Bishop of Salisbury. I can find no mention anywhere of
the family of Cardinal Hallum, or Hallam; and should be glad to know who he
was descended from, and why he had those arms assigned to him by Ciaconius,
who is tolerably correct.

The following extract is given from the journal of Mr. Spinks:--

    "Friday, 15th May, 1687. We had the observation of Mr. Booty this day.
    Captain Barrisby, Captain Bristowe, Captain Brown, I, and Mr. Ball,
    merchant, went on shore in Captain Barnaby's boat, to shoot rabbits
    upon Stromboli; and when we had done we called all our men together by
    us, and about half an hour and fourteen minutes after three in the
    afternoon, to our great surprise, we all of us saw two men come running
    towards us with such swiftness that no living man could run half so
    fast as they did run, when all of us heard Captain Barnaby say, 'Lord
    bless me, the foremost is old Booty, my next-door neighbour;' but he
    said he did not know the other that run behind: he was in black
    clothes, and the foremost was in grey. Then Captain Barnaby desired all
    of us to take an account of the time, and put it down in our
    pocket-books, and when we got on board we wrote it in our journals; for
    we saw them into the flames of fire, and there was a great noise which
    greatly affrighted us all; for we none of us ever saw or heard the like
    before. Captain Barnaby said he was certain it was old Booty, which he
    saw running over Stromboli and into the flames of Hell. It is stated
    that Captain Barnaby told his wife, and she told somebody else, and
    that it was afterward told to Mrs. Booty, who arrested Captain Barnaby
    in a thousand pound action, for what he had said of her husband.
    Captain Barnaby gave bail to it, and it came on to a trial in the Court
    of King's Bench, and they had Mr. Booty's wearing apparel brought into
    court, and the sexton of the parish, and the people that were with him
    when he died; and we swore to our journals, and it came to the same
    time within two minutes; ten of our men swore to the buttons on his
    coat, and that they were covered with the same sort of cloth his coat
    was made of, and so it proved. The jury asked Mr. Spinks if he knew Mr.
    Booty. He answered, 'I never saw him till he ran by me on the burning
    mountain.'"

The chief justice from April, 1687, to February, 1689, was Sir Robert
Wright. His name is not given in the report, but _the judge_ said--

    "Lord have mercy upon me, and grant that I may never see what you have
    seen: one, two, or three may be mistaken, but thirty never can be
    mistaken. So the widow lost her suit."

An action for slander of a deceased husband, brought by the widow, and the
defendant held to bail, is a remarkable beginning. The plea of
justification, that Booty ran into Hell, is hardly supported by evidence
that he ran into the flames at Stromboli. The evidence was, that the
defendant _said_ that one of the two runners was Booty; it does not appear
that the other witnesses knew him. The witnesses must have kept a good look
to observe the buttons of Booty's coat when he ran more than twice as fast
as any living man could run. Finally, as the time of the death and the
observation "came to the same within two minutes," and Stromboli is about
15 deg. east of Gravesend, Booty must have run to Hell before he died.

I have no doubt that "the case is well known in the navy." The facts are of
the sort usually reported to the marines; but the law such as was unknown
before 9 & 10 Vict. c. 95.

THE CONQUEST.

(Vol. ii., p. 440.; Vol. iii., p. 92.)

I question the position of S. K., that the phrase "post conquestum" is used
in the deed he cites (Vol. ii., p. 92.) for the accession of the king.
"Post conquestum" was, in records and deeds, applied with more or less
frequency to all our kings, from Edward III. to Henry VIII. To show this I
give the following references to the pages of Madox's _Formulare
Anglicanum_:-- {171}

EDWARD III. 12. 19. 92. 94. 120. 121. 139. 140. 166. 167. 168. 201. 203.

208. 233. 270. 271. 286. 331. 332. 333. 334. 351. 364. 392. 393. 394. 409.

EDWARD IV. 128. 148. 209. 234. 286. 335. 352. 365. 394. 395.

RICHARD III. 108. 209. 212. 411.

HENRY VII. 71. 214. 235. 339. 352. 365. 396. 412. 438.

HENRY VIII. 235. 236. 273. 343. 396. 414.

I believe "post conquestum" was also applied to Edward V.; but the records
and deeds of his short reign are necessarily but few.

I conjecture that the use of the term "post conquestum" thus originated.

As we had Kings of England of the name of Edward before the Conquest,
Edward the First was distinguished from these monarchs by being styled
"King Edward, the son of King Henry" (his father was called "King Henry,
the son of King John"). In like manner, Edward II. was distinguished from
his father by being called "King Edward, the son of King Edward;" but
Edward III. could not thus be distinguished from his father; he was
therefore called King Edward III.; but, as there were Kings Edward _before_
the Conquest, the third was qualified by the addition of the phrase in
question, "post conquestum." To Richard II. generally, and to his
successors up to Henry VIII. either generally or occasionally, the same
phrase, "post conquestum," was also applied; but, if we except Edward IV.
and V., this phrase was not at all required, or applicable in their cases,
inasmuch as no King of England _before_ the Conquest was named either
Richard or Henry.

DESCENT OF HENRY IV.

(Vol. ii., p. 375.; Vol. iii., p. 120.)

Upon the deposition of Richard II., 30th September, 1399, Henry IV., then
Duke of Lancaster, claimed the crown in the following terms:

    "In the name of the Fader, Sonne, and Holy Ghost, I, Henry of
    Lancastre, chalenge this Rewme of Ynglonde and the Croune, with all the
    Membres and the appurtenances, als I that am descendit be ryght lyne of
    the Blode comyng fro the gude Lord King Henry thirde, and thorghe that
    ryght that God of his grace hath sent me with helpe of my kyn and of my
    friendes to recover it: the which Rewme was in poynt to be ondone for
    defaut of Governance, and undoying of the gude Lawes."

Rapin observes upon this (vol. i. p. 476.):--

    "It was not without reason that he affected to make use of obscure
    expressions, which left undetermined the foundation upon which he built
    his pretended right. If he seemed to derive his title from Henry III.
    rather than from Edward III., his grandfather, it was because there was
    a rumour that Edmund, Earl of Lancaster, surnamed Crouch-back, was
    eldest son of Henry III.; but by reason of his deformity Edward I., his
    younger brother, was placed on the throne. According to this
    supposition, the Duke would have made the ignorant believe he could
    ground his title upon being son of Blanch of Lancaster, granddaughter
    of Edmund Crouch-back, and heiress of that family. But as he was
    sensible everybody could not be imposed upon by so gross a forgery, he
    added certain expressions, intimating that he built his right also upon
    the service he had just done the state. This is the meaning of the
    claim, expressed in such obscure terms. As it was resolved to adjudge
    the crown to the Duke, the Parliament took care not to examine his
    claim too closely, but were very willing to suppose it uncontestable.
    Thus, without any regard to the just rights of the Earl of March, it
    was decreed that Henry should be proclaimed king, which was done that
    very day," &c.

It would seem, however, that Henry was to a certain extent compelled to
make his claim to the crown in the form he did (Hales, _Hist. C. L._ c.
5.), notwithstanding his desire to do so as a conqueror. (Seld. _Tit. Hon._
l. 3.)

Replies to Minor Queries.

_Chauncy--Entwysel._--To a dry genealogical Query (Vol. iii., p. 61.), your
readers will wish me to reply as briefly as possible. F. R. R. will find
that Sir H. Chauncy's statement is borrowed from Weever. The latter founded
his statement, that "Wilfred Entwysel was the last heir of his house," on
the authority of Dalton, Norroy; but this statement, as your correspondent
has shown, and as other evidence would prove, is not well-founded. It may
be assumed that Sir Bertyne Entwysel did not leave issue, _male_, by Lucy
his wife, the daughter of Sir John Ashton, of Ashton-under-Lyne, as Leland
speaks of a daughter only, "of whom Master Bradene, of Northamptonshire, is
descended." His connexion with Lancashire is shown by his epitaph, and by
our finding his name as a witness to a Lancashire charter. The alliance
which he formed may be urged as a further proof. Leland's expression, that
"he came into England," may imply that Sir Bertyne remained in France
discharging the duties of his office, from the period of the Battle of
Agincourt, where he {172} signally distinguished himself, until his
services were again called for in the Wars of the Roses.

_"Pretended" Reprint of Ancient Poetry_, in J. Taylor's Catalogue of 1824
(Vol. ii., p. 463.), replied to by CATO (Vol. ii., p. 500.).--My attention
has been drawn to the above, wherein doubts have been raised as to the
existence of a volume supposed to be UNIQUE; and criticisms follow on my
note, which records the fact, that "only TWO COPIES were reprinted." CATO
has already stated that the reprinting the TWO COPIES was at the expense of
the late Rev. Peter Hall; and ONE COPY produced at his sale twenty
shillings: the other copy bore the impress of Mr. Davidson, a highly
respectable printer; and that only two copies were reprinted, one of which
came direct to me from the Rev. Peter Hall. This copy was purchased from me
by an eminent statesman, who has formed one of the finest libraries in the
kingdom.

Calmet's _Dissertation sur la Parente des Juifs et des Lacedemoniens_,
which is included in his Dissertations, Paris, 1720, in 3 vols. 4to, and
also in his _Commentaires_.--Stillingfleet's _Origines Sacrae_, book iii.,
c. 4., who admits the probability that the Spartans had relation to
Abraham, as deriving from Phaleg, from whom Abraham came. This appears to
have been intended by the expressions of Josephus, [Greek: ex henos genous
kai ek tes pros Abramon oikeiotetos] (book xii. c. iv.); but the Versions,
and most critics, interpret the words in the 12th chap. of 1 Maccabees,
[Greek: ek genous Abraam], as implying that they came from Abraham: see
Selden, _de Synedriis_, l. ii. c. iii. s.v.--The Rev. Charles Forster's
_Historical Geography of Arabia_, part i. sect. vi., in which he discusses
"the vestiges of Arab colonies, and maintains the Arabo-Abrahamic origin of
the Greeks."--Stephanus Morinus, in _Diss. de Cognatione Lacedaemoniorum et

Your correspondent, who, in Vol. ii., p. 230., requests to be supplied with
"a list of all the theories and publications respecting the ten tribes
commonly called the Lost Tribes," will probably be satisfied with that
furnished by Basnage's _History of the Jews_, in which, however, he
overlooks the theory of Olaus Rudbeckius, Filius, that they are to be found
neither in Asia, nor Africa, nor America, but in Lapland! The same author,
in a treatise _de Ave Selau, cujus mentio fit Numer._ xi. 31., endeavours
to establish an analogy between the Hebrew and Gothic languages.

_Queen Mary's Lament_ (Vol. iii., p. 89.).--The following copy of verses,
written by this beautiful and unfortunate princess, during her confinement
in Fotheringay Castle, was presented to the public by the kindness of a
very eminent and liberal collector:--

 "Que suis-je helas? et de quoi sert la vie?
  J'en suis fors qu'un corps prive de cueur;
  Un ombre vayn, un objet de malheur,
  Qui n'a plus rien que de mourir en vie.
  Plus ne me portez, O enemys, d'envie,
  Qui n'a plus l'esprit a la grandeur,
  J'ai consomme d'excessive douleur,
  Voltre ire en bref de voir assouvie.
  Et vous amys qui m'avez tenu chere,
  Souvenez-vous que sans cueur, et sans santey,
  Je ne scaurois auqun bon oeuvre faire.
  Souhaitez donc fin de calamitey,
  Et que _sus bas_ etant assez punie,
  J'aie ma part en la joie infinie."

The verses are written on a sheet of paper, by Mary herself, in a large
rambling hand. The following literal translation of them was made by a
countrywoman of Mary's, a lady in beauty of person and elegance of mind by
no means inferior to that accomplished and unfortunate princess:

 "Alas, what am I? and in what estate?
    A wretched corse bereaved of its heart,
  An empty shadow, lost, unfortunate:
    To die is now in life my only part.
  Foes to my greatness, let your envy rest,
    In me no taste for grandeur now is found;
  Consum'd by grief, with heavy ills oppress'd,
    Your wishes and desires will soon be crown'd.
  And you, my friends, who still have held me dear,
    Bethink you, that when health and heart are fled,
    And ev'ry hope of future good is dead,
 'Tis time to wish our sorrows ended here;
  And that this punishment on earth is given,
  That my pure soul may rise to endless bliss in heaven."

Immediately before her execution she repeated the following Latin prayer,
composed by herself, {173} and which has been set to a beautiful plaintive
air, by Dr. Harington of Bath:

 "O Domine Deus speravi in te!
  O care mi Jesu, nunc libera me!
  In dura catena, in misera poena desidero te!
  Languendo, gemendo, et genuflectendo,
  Adoro, imploro, ut liberes me!"

It may be thus paraphrased:

 "In this last solemn and tremendous hour,
  My Lord, my Saviour, I invoke Thy power!
  In these sad pangs of anguish and of death,
  Receive, O Lord, Thy suppliant's parting breath!
  Before Thy hallowed cross she prostrate lies,
  O hear her prayers, commiserate her sighs!
  Extend thy arms of mercy and of love,
  And bear her to thy peaceful realms above."

_Tandem D. O. M._ (Vol. iii., p. 62.)--I would suggest that this
inscription might be resolved into

 "Tandem Deus Otia Misit,"

a thanksgiving for the fulfilment of some oft-made prayer or long-cherished
hope; the idea--if I am right in my conjecture--having probably been taken
from the 6th line of Virgil's 1st Eclogue--

 "O Melibaee! deus nobis haec otia fecit."

Any accounts that remain of the great Carthaginian Captain's Cornish
namesake, may perhaps tend to show that he had preferred the "otium cum
dignitate" of literary leisure to the turmoil of the battle of life, and to
the use of the _harness_, whether civil or military, that it had forced him
to wear.

_Tandem D. O. M._ (Vol. iii., p. 62.).--Is not D. O. M. the common

_D. O. M._--I am emboldened by the Query respecting "Tandem D. O. M. (Vol.

tombstone, the inscription is frequent on the continent. I am aware that it
is interpreted "Deo Optimo Maximo" when occurring in the dedication of a
church; but it appears on a tomb to supply the place of our M.S., or the
D. M. of the Romans. Can any of your readers give me the true meaning? It
must be well known, I should think, to all who have studied inscriptions.
As I am indebted to Faber Marinus for an excuse for putting this Query, it
is only courteous to suggest a solution to his D. O. M.--may it be "Datus
omnino Musis?"

NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.

To such of our readers, and we believe they form neither the least numerous
nor the least intelligent portion of our friends, who consider the columns
which we devote to _Folk Lore_ among the most interesting parts of our
paper, we recommend an attentive perusal of a little work, which has just
reached a second edition, and which is calculated to invest with fresh
interest that very curious subject. We allude to Dr. Herbert Mayo's volume
_On the Truths contained in Popular Superstitions, with an Account of
Mesmerism_. Dr. Mayo's object is "to exhibit in their true light the
singular natural phenomena by which old superstition and modern
charlatanism have in turn profited,--to indicate their laws, and to
develope their theory"--and he does this in a way to excite the reader's
deepest attention, and to convince him that there are more things in heaven
and earth than are dreamt of in his philosophy.

_Daily Steps towards Heaven, or Practical Thoughts on the Gospel History,
and especially on the Life and Teaching of our Lord Jesus Christ. For every
Day in the Year, according to the Christian Seasons, with Titles and
Characters of Christ, and a Harmony of the Four Gospels_, is the ample and
descriptive title of a small devotional volume, which has been received
with such favour by all classes of churchmen as to have passed through two
large editions in little more than a twelve-month; which is better
testimony to its merits than any we could give.

Messrs. Sotheby and Wilkinson will sell on Monday next, and the five

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
