OUR LIST OF MISSION FIELD WORKERS.


We commend to our readers the catalogue of our missionary workers and
their stations, in our magazine of this month. Mere names and places
have very little interest to the general reader, but a study of this
list to one who is interested in mission work, and who has the welfare
of his country at heart, will prove to be very suggestive. Some of the
larger institutions, schools and churches, are familiar to many, but
the greater number probably have never been located by our readers
upon the map. There are 243 stations with 617 workers.

Each station represents a great deal of missionary consecration and
devoted service for the Master. Could our readers look in upon these
workers it would quicken the spirit of their own consecration and
benevolence. If they could hear the bell which early calls the
students to prayers, and to their studies; if they could unite with
those engaged in their morning devotions; if they could listen to the
faithful and able instruction of line upon line, and precept upon
precept, this list would cease to be a mere catalogue of names and
places, and would become alive with history.

Nobly are these missionaries doing their work. Let them have the
prayerful sympathy of those whom they represent. Let them feel that
their burdens are lightened and their days are brightened because they
are remembered by their home churches. Do not forget them when you
utter the prayer of our Master, "Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on
earth as it is in heaven."

These missionaries, teachers, and ministers, do not ask the compassion
of those who remain at home. They are happy in their chosen work. They
see the need as it cannot be told. They have a rich reward in the
assurance that their lives, which they have invested in this way, are
bringing abundant returns.

We call attention also to the supplemental list, which shows the names
and residences grouped together side by side. This grouping itself is
interesting as showing the nationality of our work. May we not hope
that these who have gone out from us shall be spared the anxiety and
sorrow which must come by a contraction of their work unless those
from whom they have gone shall be able to meet its pecuniary
necessities? Will not those to whom these words shall come unite their
prayers and contributions with those of the faithful workers at the
front, that they may be saved from the disaster of retreat from the
work to which they have given their hearts and hands?

MEMORANDUM.--It would be well for those who are interested in the
American Missionary Association work to preserve this February
magazine, because it contains the catalogue of our workers for the
year.

HOWARD UNIVERSITY, THEOLOGICAL DEPARTMENT.


The Junior class is the best qualified that has entered within the
knowledge of the present teachers. The general standard of scholarship
steadily advances. The students are very useful in all kinds of church
and mission work in the city. Rev. C. H. Butler is doing excellent
work in place of his honored father, who was so long connected with
us. Dr. Pitzer, of the Southern Presbyterian Church, who was also long
our faithful co-worker, gave an eloquent address at our last
anniversary, and has just kindly remembered us with a valuable gift to
our library. Rev. Mr. Reoch, the new pastor of the Fifth
Congregational Church, is doing enthusiastic work in Rev. Mr. Jones'
place, and in place of Rev. Mr. Small, Rev. Dr. Little gives our
students the benefit of his rich experience as their instructor in
pastoral theology.

McINTOSH, GEORGIA.

PROF. FRED. W. FOSTER.


We are beginning our year's work with much better promise than in any
previous year. Our enrollment is a fourth greater now than at the
close of October last year, when it was greater than ever before at
that time. Our boarding department is also filling up much faster.
Better than this is the very marked gain in the tone of the school and
in the character of the work done, and the orderliness and
studiousness of the pupils. It is cheering to look through the various
rooms and note the cheerful diligence with which they are at work.
The reverse side of all this is our lack of room, and the great
poverty of our people this year, caused by a most unfavorable season.
The generosity of our friends at the North can help us meet the
latter, and Christian Endeavor Hall would completely remove the former
difficulty.

FINANCIAL STATEMENT.


For the three months ending December 31, 1894, our receipts, as
compared with the corresponding months of the previous year, show a
slight increase in donations, but a falling off in estates, income and
tuition. The last item is sad, but not surprising, for the people in
the South are so utterly impoverished that the payment of tuition is
well-nigh impossible. On the side of expenditures, as compared with
last year, there has been reduction in all items, mission,
publication, collecting agency and administration, and yet the balance
of indebtedness for the three months is $15,671.10, which, added to
the previous indebtedness of $66,360.97, makes a total of $82,032.07.
We can only lay these figures before the friends of the poorest and
most depressed of the people of our land and invoke such help as
patriotism and Christianity will dictate.

LINCOLN MEMORIAL DAY.


We call the attention of our readers once more to the observance of
Lincoln Memorial Day, February 10th being the Sunday nearest the
birthday of the Great Emancipator. Last year, in accordance with the
recommendation of our annual meeting, the churches interested in our
great work were invited to observe the day in commemoration of the
emancipation of the slaves in its bearings on the great work which
emancipation involved--the preparation of these people for their new
life. We regard the renewal of this observance as specially fitting
now, because the colored people of the South are passing through a
terrible ordeal, and need all the encouragement and help that is
possible, to save them from utter discouragement. It is said that the
work of this Association is among the agencies most helpful in their
elevation. Last year a Concert Exercise was prepared in this office
for the use of Sunday-schools, giving a sketch of the life of the
Great Emancipator. We have copies remaining, which we will gladly
forward when requested to do so. Pastors and school superintendents
may vary this exercise by introducing other patriotic addresses or
hymns in place of those given.

LEWIS TAPPAN, ESQ.


Probably the two most unpopular men in New York fifty years ago were
Arthur and Lewis Tappan. They were ostracized, ridiculed, slandered,
mobbed, and their lives threatened. It is said that the best apples in
the orchard are on the tree that has the most clubs under it. If this
rule applies to people as well, then the Tappans were very good men.
They were honest and prosperous in business; they were sincere and
active Christians, giving liberally to all forms of benevolent effort,
foreign and home missions, the Bible and Tract Societies, theological
and college education, but their one great fault was _they were
abolitionists_--a fault that covered a multitude of their virtues.
They were both deeply interested in the American Missionary
Association, but Mr. Lewis Tappan was most active in its behalf, and
it is of him that we wish to speak.

[Illustration: (Portrait of Lewis Tappan.)]

Lewis Tappan took a prominent part in the organization of some of the
missionary societies that preceded the American Missionary
Association, and that were finally merged into it. He was very
efficient in his activities in securing the organization of the
Association, was present at the meeting in Albany, was elected one of
its executive board, and its first treasurer. This last office he held
for many years, entirely without compensation. He interested himself
in every form of its activities, and was a frequent contributor to THE
AMERICAN MISSIONARY. A * affixed to many articles shows a portion of
his contributions to the early issues of this periodical.

Mr. Tappan was an earnest Christian man and very conscientious in
regard to the distribution of his wealth. He wrote two tracts,
endeavoring to show that men should not accumulate property to be left
to be subject to litigation after death, but that it should be
expended during life. Mr. Tappan lived up to his own theory--giving
much during life and leaving little at his death.

Mr. Tappan had the gratification of seeing the slaves emancipated and
the still greater gratification of aiding with all his strength of
brain and purse in fitting them for the responsibilities and
privileges of their new life. His was a life worth living.

HON. WILLIAM JACKSON.


[Illustration: (Portrait of William Jackson)]

When the American Missionary Association was formed in 1846 it was so
unpopular on account of its anti-slavery attitude that it was not easy
to find an able and influential man with sufficient courage to accept
its presidency. But the man was found. Hon. William Jackson, a citizen
of Boston, and an active and successful business man, was so deeply in
sympathy with the poor slave that he was willing to assume the
position, and all the more because others shrunk from it. Mr. Jackson
was a member of the Massachusetts Legislature, and afterward was
elected to Congress, and was subsequently reelected for another term
by an almost unanimous vote. He was selected by the Liberty Party as
its first candidate for Governor of the State of Massachusetts. He was
a warm and efficient advocate of the temperance cause. He devoted much
of his time and energies to the establishment of railroads in
Massachusetts--among others the Boston and Albany, Boston and
Worcester, and Providence and Worcester. In various capacities as
director or general agent he rendered efficient service in the work of
these roads. But the charm of Mr. Jackson's life was its Christian
element. At the age of thirty-seven he moved to Newton, Mass., where
he spent the remainder of his life. He was actively engaged in the
erection of the church edifice and gathering the new church, and was
steadfast in his attendance at the prayer meeting, monthly concert,
Sunday-school, and other exercises. Advancing years and failing health
led him to make a somewhat extended trip through Europe. But life was
coming to its end, and it closed with him in deepening interest in the
cause of Christ at home and abroad, and in the strongest assurances of
a triumphant faith.

S'KOKOMISH MISSION.


The venerable Dr. Cushing Eells left behind him many mementoes of his
remarkable activity in promoting educational and missionary work in
Oregon and Washington, on the Pacific coast. Nor with his decease has
his good work ceased. Two sons of his have gone forward in similar
lines of effort. His son, Major Edwin Eells, was one of the first
nominees of the American Missionary Association under General Grant's
Peace Policy, and he was renominated by us so long as we were allowed
to make nominations, and he has been continued ever since, making a
total service of twenty-three years and a half. During this time the
Indians have received titles to their lands and have become citizens.
His effective hand has been seen in all their improvement. But now we
learn that he has been notified that he is soon to be relieved. His
removal is said to be due solely to politics. We are sorry for the
Indians, and we are ashamed of a Government that will deprive them for
partisan purposes of a good agent.

Another son of Dr. Eells, Rev. Myron Eells, was appointed as a
missionary at the S'kokomish Agency by the American Board, and when the
transfer of missions was made he was continued at the post under the
American Missionary Association--a position that he still holds. The
subjoined sketch from his pen shows that in point of honesty, in some
respects, at least, the Indians surpass their white neighbors.

HONORABLE RECORD FOR INDIANS.

BY REV. MYRON EELLS, S'KOKOMISH AGENCY, WASHINGTON.


During the late financial stringency the principal business man near
this reservation failed, and put his property into the hands of a
receiver. The S'kokomish Indians owed him about three thousand dollars,
and the whites owed him over twenty thousand. The first business of
the receiver was to try to collect these debts. After he had made
considerable effort in this direction he said to me substantially as
follows: "These Indians have made more honest efforts to pay these
debts than the whites have, as a whole."

As the Indians have become citizens they have been required to work
road taxes among their other duties. The road supervisor said to me:
"I obtained more satisfactory work out of the Indians than I did out
of the white men." The Indians had often said that the roads were
theirs, and they wanted to use them, so that they were not losing
anything, even if they worked a little over their time, and several of
them who were over fifty years of age voluntarily gave a day's work or
two. While the Indians by no means always do as I wish to have them,
yet these facts are encouraging.

THE TRIALS OF MISSIONARY LIFE.--The hardships and dangers to which our
Indian missionaries are exposed are illustrated in the sad experience
of Rev. T. L. Riggs, the superintendent of the missions of the
Association at Oahe, S. D.

The exposure to the blazing sun and cutting winds and excessive cold
of the Dakota winters has produced acute inflammation of the eyes, so
that Mr. Riggs is entirely blind. We trust this is only temporary, but
the pain and confinement in a dark room, and necessary retirement from
the active work which Supt. Riggs so energetically carries on, are a
painful trial, and will awaken the sympathy of all our readers.

A sad affliction has also befallen our honored missionary, Dr. A. L.
Riggs, and his family, of Santee, Neb. Their little grandson, the
child of the missionary daughter in China, has recently died of
small-pox under very painful circumstances. The entire family in China
had this disease, but at last accounts all but the little child were
recovering.

GRAND VIEW, TENN.

BY SECRETARY RYDER.


I reached Pleasant Hill last Saturday, driving from Grand View. It is
of Grand View that I want to report first.

They are in the best condition that I have ever seen. The teachers are
doing well, and the new pastor has taken hold most earnestly and
successfully.

No one can question the bringing in of the mountain people, both in
church and school. More than two-thirds of the pupils are of native
families, and the native people are filling the church. Mr. Dorman,
the new pastor, has put the second service into the evening again, so
as to get more of the mountain folk, and he succeeds. It was a grand
thing to get him, coming with so good an education and devoted spirit.
The people are feeling happier than for years, and cooperating
cordially.

The institute is full. They cannot get on without more room. In the
primary grade they enroll sixty-nine, and have seats for twenty-eight.
The attendance is fairly well up to the enrollment and they absolutely
cannot get on long this way. It is a splendid work. The American
Missionary Association has reason to be proud of it, but it seems
imperative to have more room.

The work all over this portion of the mountains is thoroughly
encouraging.

GOSPEL TRANSFORMATIONS.

BY A MOUNTAIN PREACHER.


This autumn has been for me a season of hard labor, and, at the same
time, one of great rejoicing. For more than a month I have been
laboring night and day almost incessantly striving to lead souls to
Jesus, and the dear Lord has blessed me to see more than thirty happy
conversions. Tired, almost exhausted, still I must press on, for there
is yet much to be done.

In the meetings held this fall I have realized more fully than ever
before in my life the mighty power of the Spirit, and the blessedness
of the religion of the Lord Jesus Christ.

At a place in Scott County, Tenn., where I held a ten days' meeting,
this fact of the Holy Spirit's power and the blessedness of the
Christian religion was most beautifully illustrated, as the following
incident will show.

When I began preaching there the neighborhood was in a universal state
of ferment. Fussings, fightings, hard feelings between neighbors were
everywhere; and between denominations most bitter prejudice and cruel
jealousies. There were men there, close neighbors and kinsfolk, who
had not spoken to each other for three years. Some were so angry with
each other that they were fighting occasionally and trying to kill
each other. They came to church with their pistols in their pockets to
shoot each other, and I expected that we might have war in the church
yard at any time and men killed. But while they held their thumbs on
their pistol hammers I wielded the hammer of God's word with
unrelenting force. While they were getting ready to fire revolvers I
was firing red hot gospel shot into them with deadly effect. Their
hard hearts softened, they weakened, they fell before the sword of the
Spirit. Strong men broke down and wept like children. Grasping each
other by the hand, embracing each other in their arms amidst a flood
of tears, they confessed to each other their faults, and begged pardon
and prayed and shouted as I never saw men do before in my life.
Hostile enemies were made happy friends, would-be murderers were
converted to God, hard feelings among neighbors were swept away,
denominational prejudice was forgotten, and brotherly love and
Christian peace reigned supreme. And besides this some twenty-five
precious souls were saved; among them an old grandmother was brought
to Jesus. And still the good work goes on.

Praise the Lord for His wonderful love and for His mighty power which
He has manifested in the salvation of precious souls.

THE POOR HELPING THE POOREST.

_A Charming Picture of Self-Sacrifice._

PROFESSOR F. T. WATERS.


The extreme poverty among many of the colored people of Wilmington, N.
C., led me to think that there would be many families that would have
no Christmas gifts unless given by those who could spare, even from
their scant living, a portion to be given to those wholly destitute.
Accordingly I invited the children in all the rooms in Gregory
Institute to bring such offerings as they were willing to make, to be
afterward distributed to those who otherwise would have no Christmas
and were without the necessities of life even. The idea seemed to meet
with general approval among teachers and pupils. Friday, the last day
before the Christmas vacation, was appointed to bring in the gifts,
and the amount contributed wholly exceeded our most extravagant hopes.
Shortly after 8 o'clock the school children began to arrive laden with
gifts, consisting of almost every imaginable article that could be
used. Some brought a sweet potato--always the largest they could
find--others a pound of sugar, rice, flour, bacon, pork, beans, peas,
corn meal, cabbages, turnips, tea, coffee, matches, apples, oranges,
grits, and if there are any other things to be found among eatables I
think I can produce them from the packages now deposited in the sewing
room.

Besides this quite a quantity of wood was brought, and a good
supply--several bundles, at least--of fat pine for lighters, and
considerable clothing. One special gift I must mention. It was from a
little girl in the primary class. The girl is about eleven or twelve
years old, and very poor. She worked all last summer and saved her
money to pay her tuition in our school this year, and, as I have
learned, had secured nearly enough to pay her tuition during the year.
But, alas, poor little Mary. For some reason, probably to get the food
necessary to live, her mother was obliged to take her hard earned and
slowly accumulated money, and before school began she found that what
she had so long hoped and planned for she could not realize. However,
she did not give up her cherished plan of coming to school, but worked
away, got her some clothes, and about the first of November presented
herself as wishing to come to school. She brought all the money she
had left, _ten cents_, and said if I would only let her come she was
sure she could pay the rest before long. I kept track of her and found
from her teacher that the poor girl could not obtain anything further
for her tuition, but that she was a very promising girl, so I have let
her come, and I have prayed that some one may be led to contribute $8
for her tuition. But what surprised me most was the Christmas offering
this child made. Just before school called, she came tugging two large
sticks of wood, the combined weight being twenty pounds. This she had
got cut into two pieces and had carried it more than a mile in order
that some one poorer than she might be blessed at Christmas time. This
little incident made me feel that I had never known sacrifice
before--for here was one who often goes hungry to bed, without any of
the comforts of life, yet to make others happy gave literally "all she
had." Truly were the blessed Lord here His words regarding the poor
widow must have been repeated. I feel that the wood she brought is
almost too sacred to be put to common use. I would that a piece of it
were in every Christian home to teach the lesson of true sacrifice.

On Christmas morning a dozen homes will be made happy by these humble
gifts. One old lady in our visits we found so destitute that she had
tasted nothing from Saturday night till Tuesday, when one of the girls
of Gregory school took her in her breakfast. The old lady telling
about it said she knew the Lord would not let her starve. The teachers
have voluntarily taxed themselves ten cents a month, which provides
for her food at least. I need not multiply these cases. Many
sacrifices in kind, if not in degree, could be mentioned equal to that
of little Mary, and many cases of need as extreme as that of "Aunt
Maggie." The scanty purses of the A. M. A. teachers, many of whom, as
in my own case, are obliged to economize in every way to keep our own
families from actual want, are inadequate to meet the demand, and why
should we multiply their cases on our minds when we are powerless to
help?

CHILDREN'S CAUSES FOR THANKFULNESS.

MISS LILLIAN L. GOAR, BLOWING ROCK, N. C.


_Dear Friends_: I want to tell you of our Junior Thanksgiving service
last Wednesday eve. The meeting was led by a Junior. After prayer by
one of the members the leader asked of each one: "What have _you_ to
be thankful for?" We had so many blessings given that a large
blackboard was covered, with reports of the many "thankfulnesses." The
following are a few of the many: "For Christ most of all," "the Holy
Bible," "health," "warm sunshine," "blue sky," "I don't know of
anything I'm _not_ thankful for," "for plenty of everything, bread and
fruit and everything to eat," "for forgiveness," "Junior meetings,"
"to bring wood and water for our mothers and fathers." One of the
several four-year-olds in school was thankful for a "stove, love (for)
our brothers, to play, eatin' an' things to cook it in."

And this same little boy, who comes from a home anything but
attractive, had this sentence in his prayer, "thankful for home."
Another dear Junior was thankful for good times and "for my little
sister an' father an' mother." "The privilege to go to school" was
another cause of thankfulness, while many times, both in prayer and
speaking, was "the dear teacher" mentioned.

The prayers were earnest, simple and sincere, and I felt much nearer
heaven after the little ones had gone from their childish meeting. And
I felt more than ever before the divine presence with us. The Juniors
carry their Christian ideas into everything. In school one day I asked
"What is the _heart_ for?" And a little girl (a Junior) replied
quickly "To let _Jesus_ come in."

As the hoped-for advancement lies with the children, I feel that the
work is very encouraging.

TO HELP HER OWN PEOPLE.--A minister in a Northern State sends to us a
check for $500, which he says is the gift of a colored lady of over
seventy years of age, to aid in the education of her people in the
South. She has $500 more, which she retained for the present in view
of emergencies, but which she intends ultimately to give to the
Association for the same purpose. The minister says she is
intelligent, a diligent reader, and an interesting person to meet. She
has been a tailoress and probably has earned most of her money with
her needle. Such a person is an honor to her race and to the church of
Christ.

CONTRASTS OF MISSION CHURCH WORK.

BY SEC. F. P. WOODBURY.


Our mission churches of the South reach different classes of people.
Some are in the large cities, others in populous towns, others in
smaller country villages, and still others in entirely rural districts
among the plantations. The methods of these churches vary as widely as
their location. Some of them take advantage of institutional methods
of church work in all their various forms of Christian service. Many
churches which do not undertake so large a distribution of effort
still have their circles of King's Sons and Daughters, missionary
societies, and, almost everywhere, their Christian Endeavor Societies.
Many of the smaller churches have day schools closely associated with
the congregation, sometimes under the conduct of the pastor or his
wife, or both.

[Illustration: HOWARD CHAPEL AND PARSONAGE.]

Among our more prominent churches is the Howard Chapel, of Nashville,
Tenn., a picture of which, with the new parsonage, is found on this
page. This church is located on the original site of Fisk University,
and was formerly the chapel of the University. The building is a
commodious brick structure. The church has had many fluctuations in
its membership and condition, but under its present pastor, Rev. J. E.
Moorland, formerly Y. M. C. A. secretary at Washington, D. C., it has
taken on new life and vigor. The membership has rapidly grown. All the
various forms of Christian activity are thoroughly organized, and the
pastor has commended himself not only to the members of the church and
congregation, but to the residents of all that portion of the city.
Lately the congregation took up the question of affording their pastor
a parsonage, and have built a neat and comfortable structure at the
side of the church, which they are now making payment for from their
own means.

[Illustration: THE McELDERRY MISSION, ALA.]

In strong contrast with this city church work is the McElderry
Mission, formed and carried on by Rev. J. M. Roan, of Ironaton, Ala.
Mr. Roan, like many other pastors, was anxious that his church should
take hold of aggressive Christian work, and formed a mission at some
distance from the church, out among the plantations. His young men
took hold vigorously with him in the new work and put up the log cabin
chapel, which is shown in the accompanying illustration. It is an
interesting indication of their Christian consecration that the
members of this mission church were so desirous to take hold
themselves of mission work among those of their people still less
favored than they. Mr. Roan says that they are proud of their little
log cabin mission, and that its congregation has steadily increased.
There are now nine Congregational members living near the mission. Of
late there has been quite a desire on the part of many to build a
church in place of the mission cabin, and the people are already
beginning to raise means for this purpose. A flourishing Sunday-school
is carried on in connection with this mission work.

GLEAMS OF SUNSHINE.

BY REV. W. C. POND, D.D.


The new year of our Chinese Mission opened cloudily. We had passed
through three months of close and anxious questioning about ways and
means; most of the teachers and helpers had received no salary for
from one to three months. Hard times had been crowding our Chinese out
of employment. Families in which they had served felt compelled to do
without them. They were moving to and fro with less inclination to
study, or, possibly, to listen to the word of life, than in the days
when plenty of hard work left them weary in frame, but not heartsore.

At any rate--for these reasons or for others--the reports for
September were, on the whole, less cheering, I think, than any I had
ever received; but now, with the October reports all at hand, we find
the clouds breaking away and have "sunshine in our souls."

The membership of the schools was larger by 33 and the average
attendance by 17, but the gleams that bring best cheer are such as
these:

From Chin Foy, in Sacramento: "Eight names have been signed to pledge
cards for the Christian Endeavor members. Hope this society will be
established before long. Four new members have united with our
Association [thus professing faith in Christ and full consecration to
Him. W. C. P.], and three brethren expect to be baptized by Dr. Hoyt
and to unite with the church next communion. Thank God for His
blessing. The work is encouraging lately." This brother, whose name
may be familiar to the constant and attentive readers of THE
MISSIONARY, and who has been for ten years or more one of our most
useful helpers, instructs me to reduce his scanty salary two-thirds
(from $30 to $10 per month), and will try to make up what is lacking
by other work, so that with our reduced resources our work may not be
hindered.

Loo Quong writes from Fresno concerning a sick brother who was
converted in China, and has never been identified with any of our
missions: "Miss Beaton [the teacher] found him sick on the street and
asked him to come and live in the mission, in God's name. No one dared
to speak for him to help him in any way whatever, outside our mission.
I asked him, at length, after he had been with us many months, if he
would like to go back home. He says it would be the best way. Thus far
I succeeded in taking up subscriptions for his passage. [There are
$45.30 outside of Fresno, and $28 which was taken up here.] The
Christian Endeavor of the Congregational Church, through Rev. J. H.
Collins, their pastor, gave him passage from here to San Francisco. It
was a kind act of them all. I think God has blessed us all by enabling
us to have this thing done so well in His name, because Mr. Lai Fat
[the beneficiary] is not a member of the Association, nor have any of
us known him before. May God send him to his family all right, and may
his family be blessed through his return to them, and may the Lord
spare him many days with his family in order to lead them to Christ!"
Surely there is a gleam of sunshine in this act of Christian love.
All, or nearly all, our missions joined in it. It is really no unusual
thing with us.

Miss Bradley, of Ventura, writes: "As soon as Yong Kay came [who
divides his time as helper between the two neighboring missions of
Santa Barbara and Ventura] he began measures to revive our C. E.
Society, and now we have one of twelve members. Its meeting are held
on Friday evening, commencing about 9 o clock, and continuing
indefinitely. It is wonderful how they seem to realize the meaning of
the pledge and keep true to it. There is no lagging; no 'awful
pauses.' About two weeks ago they began preparations for a Christian
Endeavor social. Invitations were sent out to all the ministers and
other Christians specially interested in missions. More than fifty
assembled and listened to the programme, which lasted about an hour.
Yong Kay's address was very fine; his use of Scripture was so apt, and
his illustrations so good, Yong Wo Quon, a good, earnest Christian,
will join the church next Sunday morning. I am satisfied that he
understands the step he is taking, and that he will be a great help to
us."

In like manner from Santa Cruz comes this word: "I am most happy to
write that the Chinese I asked you to pray for has joined the
Association and is very happy in our Christian work. Let us continue
to pray for two others who are holding back, but are 'almost
persuaded,'" and from Joe Dun, in our new mission at Watsonville,
this: "We do thank the Lord for His choosing and saving souls. Tuesday
evening of last week one of the associate members [_i.e._, of the new
C. E. society] became active. Last night we have meeting, and he rose
and gave testimony. Said he: 'I am glad to-night, for I believed in
Jesus Christ, and He will save my soul.'"

But my space is more than filled. We rejoice and take courage.

TRIBUTE TO OUR MISSIONARIES.


Apropos of the roll of our missionaries and teachers we quote an
eloquent tribute from one of the children of the American Missionary
Association who is now the strong pastor of a strong church in the
South. He alludes to a teacher who had devoted many years of her life
to our missionary work and had brought to it a sweetness of spirit and
devotion that had won the confidence and inspired the zeal of those
for whom she labored. We quote:

"The work which these teachers did was the result of no small
sacrifice. For a woman to leave her Northern home of comfort and
refinement to come South to engage in such a work and all that it
implies was not a popular thing even at the North, but in spite of
unpopularity at the North and unworthy treatment at the South, these
self-exiled men and women wrought wonderfully. They proved the best
friends that the black man has ever had. In the school they showed us
the light of letters, which had never before dawned upon us. In the
church they showed us the Light of the world, which was strangely dim
in our souls. In the shop they showed us the light of life about us,
of which we were densely ignorant. Thoughtful minds, skillful hands,
enlightened hearts--this is the heritage they brought us.

"Throughout the length and breadth of the Southland there are such
women among us working in a humble way. The work done by these moral
heroes and heroines is work in the shade, but one day, when the
sunlight of God's justice shall shine upon it, as it surely will, men
will see it and admire it. For these friends we are devoutly grateful.
Deep down in our hearts, too deep in many cases for tears, lies the
feeling of whole-souled gratitude for these moral heroes and heroines.
The half has never been told. We thank God for those who left home and
went to the war to die, if need be, that the slave might be free. But
we thank God equally for those brave men and braver women who, before
the smoke of battle cleared away, came South, and, with the spelling
book in one hand and God's holy word in the other, set the millions of
freedmen on the way toward reading, reasoning and righteousness.
Around God's throne may their crowns of life eternal glitter with the
penitential tears of a grateful people redeemed unto a common Father
by their prayers, their tears, their lives!"

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
