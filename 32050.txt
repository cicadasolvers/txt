PREFACE


This book is not intended for the expert botanist. He should consult one
of the regular Manuals which give full descriptions of each species of
plant.

Neither is it intended for the merely curious. Only those who have
sufficient interest in a plant to observe it can find its name by this
book.

Furthermore, it is not a textbook. It does not attempt to convey
botanical information, but offers merely an opportunity to learn the
names of plants.

Its mission is fully accomplished if, through its use, students,
vacationists, and plant-lovers in general are able to recognize by name
the plants about them.




HOW TO USE THE BOOK


One recognizes a plant by the presence of structural features peculiar
to itself, and not found on any other kind of plant. In such a book as
this, these characters are given one or a few at a time, and contrasted
with the characters which other sorts of plants possess. Such a
presentation is called a Key, and by its proper use the name may be
learned of any plant considered in it. This process is called
Identification.

Keys are constructed in several different ways, although the principle
of all is the same. In this book, the user will begin with lines 1a and
1b on the page headed Key to the Groups. Each of these lines includes
some descriptive matter, but only one of them can apply to the plant
being identified. For example, if the plant to be identified is an Oak,
line 1a will apply perfectly, and the same line will also apply to any
other kind of tree or to any shrub. But if the plant is a Violet, a
Buttercup, or any other herb, line 1b agrees and line 1a will not apply.
At the end of each line is a reference to be consulted next. If the
plant is a tree or shrub, one turns accordingly to Group 1, on page ix,
and begins again at the first number given. If the plant is an herb, he
follows the reference to line 2, just below, and again compares the
plants with lines 2a and 2b.

Under every number at least two lines of description are given,
designated a and b, and under a few numbers additional lines appear,
designated c, d, etc. In every case, the user of the key will select
from the different lines under the same number that particular line
which agrees with the structure of the plant, and follow up the
reference given at the end of that line. Eventually one finds at the end
of a line, instead of a number, the name of a family of plants, to which
this particular plant belongs, and then turns over to the page where
this family is treated. Under each family is a similar key, to be
followed in exactly the same way, until finally one finds instead of a
number the common name and the scientific name of the plant in hand. The
process of identification is now completed, and the student has found
the name of the plant.

In some cases, a reference is made in the key to a particular portion of
the family key. One then turns directly to this particular number in the
family key, and continues his identification in the usual way.

As a definite example of the use of the key, suppose that one has in
hand a branch of the White Oak, and that he does not know its name. To
determine its name, he will trace it through the following steps in the
key. Under the Key to the Groups, it agrees with line 1a, which refers
to Group 1, Woody Plants. Under this group it agrees in structure with
line 1a, which refers to 2; with line 2b, referring to 21; with line
21b, referring to 22; with 22b, referring to 29; with 29b, referring to
32; with 32c, referring to 47; with 47b, referring to 48; with 48b,
referring to 51; with 51b, referring to number 1b in the Beech Family.
Turning to the proper number in this family, the plant is referred to
line 3; it agrees with line 3c, referring to 10; with 10a, referring to
11; and with 11b, which gives the name of the plant. White Oak, _Quercus
alba_.

As a second example, suppose one has a common yellow-flowered plant
blooming on lawns and roadsides in spring. Under the Key to the Groups,
it agrees with 1b, referring to 2; with 2b, referring to 3; and its
net-veined leaves place it in 3b, referring to Group 4, Dicotyledones.
Under this group, its basal leaves place it in 1b, referring to 2; its
simple leaves in 2b, referring to 18; the absence of stem-leaves places
it in 18b, referring to 23; its solitary flowers on each flower-stalk
place it in 23b, referring to 24; its yellow flowers agree with 24a,
referring to 25; and its milky juice refers the plant to number 16, in
the Composite Family. In the key to this family, its lobed leaves agree
with 16b, referring on to 17; its large flowers with 17b, giving one the
common name Dandelion, and referring on to 18 to determine which kind of
Dandelion the plant may be.

At some point in the key there will be found for each plant a statement
in parentheses. This is general information concerning the height of the
plant, the color of the flowers, or the season of bloom. It must be
remembered that the height of plants is subject to great variation; that
most plants have white-flowered varieties; and that the month of bloom
depends largely on the latitude and the climate. Therefore this general
information should not be used as means of distinguishing species.

=The names of plants.= Each plant bears a scientific name. This is
composed of two parts and is usually of Latin or Greek derivation. In
some cases these names are taken directly from the Latin language, as
_Quercus_, the Oak, or _Acer_, the Maple. In other cases the name may
indicate some characteristic feature of the plant, as _Polygonum_, many
joints, for the Knotweed, or _Ammophila_, sand-loving, for the Beach
Grass.

An English name is also given for almost every kind of plant. In a few
cases there is no accepted English name, and none has been given. In
many cases the same English name applies to several kinds of plants and
has been repeated for each. When this is so, the common name is given in
the key in parentheses before the scientific name is reached. Thus, if
one is satisfied to know merely that his plant is a dandelion, he learns
it in line 17b of the key to the Composite Family, but to discover which
kind of a dandelion he has, he must follow through the key and use the
scientific name.

There is in this book, therefore, no necessity of learning or using
scientific names. The less critical may be satisfied with an English
name, and others may use the scientific names as they see fit.

=Possible Errors.= In using this book, care must be taken to compare all
the lines under each number with the plant, and to use judgment in
selecting the right one. While faulty observation or poor judgment may
lead to error, a mistake is usually due to carelessness in not following
correctly the reference at the end of the line chosen. If one reaches a
number in which none of the lines of description agrees with the plant,
it is very probable that he has made a mistake at an earlier stage of
the identification, and he should then begin anew.

It has been the intention of the author to make the key as nearly as
possible proof against errors of judgment. For example, the Indian
Turnip may be sought under either Group 3 or Group 4; the Matrimony Vine
may be identified either as a shrub or as an herb, and numerous other
similar examples may be discovered.

=Botanical Information Needed.= It is presumed that those using the book
will be familiar with the parts of the flower and with the commoner
descriptive terms applied to leaves. Unusual terms have been avoided as
far as possible, but those which do occur, as well as the simpler ones,
are explained in the glossary.

In general, only those characters have been used in the keys which can
be observed without a magnifying glass and without dissection of the
flower.

In several groups of plants, reference is made to the fuller
descriptions to be found in the Manuals. The standard manuals for
Michigan are Gray's New Manual of Botany, 7th edition (American Book
Company, $2.50), and Britton and Brown, Illustrated Flora of the
Northern States and Canada (Chas. Scribner's Sons, $13.50). These books
may be consulted in most school or public libraries.

All dimensions are expressed in the metric system. For convenience, it
may be stated that 25 millimeters (mm.) are about equal to one inch; 1
centimeter (cm.) to two-fifths of an inch; 1 decimeter (dm.) to 4
inches; and 1 meter (m.) is a little more than 3 feet.




KEY TO GROUPS


1a. Trees, shrubs, or woody climbers, with stems which last from year to
    year                                 Group 1, =WOODY PLANTS=, p. ix.

1b. Herbaceous plants, with stems which live above ground only a single
    season --2.

     2a. Plants with unusual habits or structures, including leafless,
         colorless, submerged, floating, parasitic, or hollow-leaved
         plants                     Group 2, =UNUSUAL PLANTS=, p. xxiii.

     2b. Ordinary terrestrial or swamp plants, without unusual
         structural peculiarities --3.

3a. Leaves parallel-veined (or net-veined in a few species); parts of
    the flower usually in threes or sixes, never in fives; wood-fibers
    scattered through the stem; seed with one cotyledon. All plants with
    definitely parallel-veined leaves may be identified through this
    division, unless the parts of the flower are distinctly in fives.
                                   Group 3, =MONOCOTYLEDONES=, p. xxvii.

3b. Leaves net-veined (or parallel-veined in a few species); parts of
    the flower usually in fours or fives; wood-fibers arranged in a
    circle in the stem; seeds with two cotyledons. All plants with
    definitely net-veined leaves may be identified through this
    division.                          Group 4, =DICOTYLEDONES=, p. xxx.


Note:--In order to avoid possible chances of error, many plants have
been treated under both of the above groups. The following hints may
also be useful in distinguishing Groups 3 and 4:

All herbaceous plants with deeply lobed, dissected or compound leaves
may be sought under the Dicotyledones.

All herbaceous plants with five stamens in each flower, or with seven or
more stamens and one ovary in each flower, may be sought under
Dicotyledones.

GRAMINEAE, the Grass Family

Grasses, with linear or narrow sheathing leaves, and very small flowers
without perianth in the axils of chaffy bracts, appearing in late spring
and summer.

Of the large number (over 150) of grasses in Michigan, only the
commonest are included here, and the student is referred to the Manuals
for a full treatment of them.

Their classification depends chiefly upon the structure and arrangement
of the spikelets. These consist typically of a short axis, the rachilla,
almost or quite concealed by several chaffy bracts. The two lower bracts
are termed glumes, and have no flowers in their axils. Above the glumes
are two or more other bracts, the lemmas. In the axil of each lemma, and
usually concealed by it, is a smaller bract, the palea, and between the
lemma and the palea is a single flower. The number of flowers in a
spikelet is therefore normally equal to the number of lemmas. The
spikelets are grouped in racemes, spikes, or panicles of various size.


1a. Spikelets one-flowered --2.

1b. Spikelets with 2 or more flowers --24.

    one or more long bristles arising from their base --6.

COMPOSITAE, the Composite Family

Herbs, with various types of foliage, but with flowers of characteristic
structure, resembling a sunflower, a thistle, or a dandelion. Each
apparent flower is a head of numerous small flowers, attached side by
side to the expanded end of the stem, and subtended and partly enclosed
by a series of bracts, called the involucre, which resembles a calyx.

The calyx of the individual flower is minute or actually wanting, and is
usually modified to aid in seed dispersal. It appears at the base of the
corolla, at the summit of the inferior ovary, and is known as pappus.
The structure of the pappus is best observed in the ripe fruit.

The corolla of the individual flowers consists of 5 (or rarely 4) united
petals. In some flowers the petals are united to form a tubular or
bell-shape corolla. In others they are united to form a flat or
strap-shape corolla. The stamens are attached to the corolla, and are
united by their anthers into a tube which surrounds the style, and above
which the 2-lobed stigma protrudes.

The apparent flower of a Composite, composed of several or many
individual flowers, is termed a head. It may be composed entirely of
tubular flowers, as the thistle or bone-set; or entirely of strap-shape
flowers, as the dandelion; or of both sorts together, as the aster or
sunflower. In the latter case, the tubular flowers invariably occupy the
center of the head, called the disk, and the larger strap-shape flowers
are at the margin, where their projecting corollas, called rays, may be
very conspicuous. Such heads are called radiate.

In a few composites (see 1a below) the flowers have minute corollas
without colored parts.

In identifying a composite, determine first whether the heads are
composed of tubular flowers, of strap-shape flowers, or of both sorts
together; and, secondly, observe the nature of the pappus, using
preferably the ripe heads, or at least the oldest flower-heads
available. No further difficulties will be encountered.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
