PREFACE


The object of this book is to give as complete a record as possible of
the beginning and progress of music in the United States of America.

The first things recorded are regarded as important. Hence such items as
the printing of the first book on music, the importation of the first
pipe organs, the establishment of the early musical societies are
recorded, while similar events of a more recent date are of no special
importance.

The first performance of significant works--operas, oratorios,
symphonies and other choral and orchestral works--are chronicled as
carefully as possible; also the first appearance in America of noted
musicians.

It has been practically impossible to find accurate data about the works
of the older composers,--Haydn, Mozart and others, for while there are
many programs in which their names are mentioned the work played is
seldom specified (see Mr. O. G. Sonneck's "Early Concert-Life in
America"), and one must wait until the period arrives in which the work
performed is specified. Probably some of the works mentioned had earlier
performances by small organizations but the performances recorded here
are in all probability the first adequate ones.

Among the items recorded are some which cannot be regarded as marking
the musical progress of the country, and yet are items of musical
interest;--the first performance of "The Star-Spangled Banner" and of
"America" do not mark any progress and yet are historic events.

The establishment of Gilmore's Band and Sousa's Band are items of
interest rather than of educational progress.

In compiling this work such newspapers as are available have been
consulted, also the programs of the leading choral and orchestral
societies. Valuable help has been gained from the excellent works of Mr.
Oscar G. Sonneck, Mr. E. H. Krehbiel, Mr. Philip Goepp, Mr. George P.
Upton, Allston Brown and other writers on the American stage, and above
all from the admirable notes of Mr. Philip Hale in the programs of the
Boston Symphony Orchestra. It would be ungracious to close this preface
without acknowledging with gratitude the valuable assistance of Miss
Barbara Duncan of the Boston Public Library.

_Annals of Music in America_




CHAPTER I

1640-1750


The Annals of Music in America during the first hundred years contain
very little that would seem to be of any importance to the musicians of
today. Nevertheless it is as interesting to note the beginnings of music
in this newly settled country as to watch the appearance of the baby's
first tooth.

The first settlement at Plymouth took place in 1620, and we find that in
1640 the colonists were already busy with the printing press in
Cambridge, Mass., and the second book which came from the press was a
reprint of an English Psalm book, printed under the title of the Bay
Psalm Book. This was not an original work, but its production shows that
music was already a living problem, and was even then part of the life
of the colonists.

Practically nothing more of note happened until the importation of the
first pipe organ, in 1700. This was quickly followed by other similar
instruments in different parts of the country, and even by the building
of organs by Americans, the first being by John Clemm in New York, which
contained three manuals and twenty-six stops, and the next by Edward
Bromfield in Boston. Bromfield's organ had two manuals and 1200 pipes,
but was not completed when he died in 1746.

The early history of music in New England, as handed down to us by
writers on the subject, seems to have consisted chiefly of church
singing, concerning which there were many controversies. The early
composers of New England were mainly occupied in composing psalm tunes,
and in teaching singing schools.

The accounts of secular music come chiefly from Charleston, S. C., at
which place many musicians entered this continent after visiting the
West Indies. In fact, the first song recital on record in America took
place at Charleston in 1733, while Boston had a concert in 1731 and
Charleston had one in 1732. Charleston also claims the first performance
of ballad opera on record in America (1735).

It must not, however, be supposed that New England had no secular music.
The concert above mentioned goes to show the contrary. Also there is a
record of small wind instruments, such as oboes and flageolets, being
brought to Boston for the purposes of trade--possibly with the idea that
New England shepherds might play to their sheep, as shepherds in other
countries are supposed to do.

We know that every farm had its spinning wheel and that clothes were
made of the homespun woollens, but neither historian nor poet has ever
pictured a New England shepherd with the shepherd's pipe. Imagination
has not so far run riot.

Music was in a very elementary stage during the first hundred years. The
country was sparsely populated, and music depends on the existence of a
community. Even in 1750 the cows, according to tradition, were still
occupied, during their daily peregrinations, in laying out the streets
of the future city of Boston,--a city which was destined to be one of
the leaders in matters musical.

  NOTE. _When a work is mentioned as "given" or "played" or
    "presented," it means the first performance in America.
    When "produced" or "production" or "premiere" is used the
    first public performance anywhere is indicated._

CHAPTER II

1750-1800


The first item of especial interest in this period is the performance of
the "Beggar's Opera" at the "Theatre in Nassau Street," New York. This
theatre was a rather tumbledown affair and was not built for the
purpose. It had a platform and rough benches. The chandelier was a
barrel hoop through which several nails were driven, and on these nails
were impaled candles, which provided all the light, and from which the
tallow was likely to drip on the heads of such of the audience as had
the best seats.

But three years later (in 1753) Lewis Hallam, who had been giving
performances with his company in the more southern States, got
permission to build a theatre on the site of this old place, and the
house was opened in September with a play, "The Conscious Lovers,"
followed by a ballad farce, "Damon and Phillida."

In 1759 we find the first avowedly musical organization in America, "The
Orpheus Club," was in existence in Philadelphia, and concerts were
becoming more frequent. We also find a St. Cecilia Society founded in
Charleston, S. C., an organization which lasted for a hundred and fifty
years.

Other societies followed at short intervals and in widely scattered
localities; the "Handel Society" of Dartmouth College, about 1780, the
"Stoughton (Mass.) Musical Society," 1786, and "The Musical Society" of
New York City, all tend to show that social centres were developing, and
the people were finding expression in music.

An indication of what had been growing by degrees is found in the
reports of concerts. Mention of instruments such as violins, French
horns, oboes, trombones, etc., was made here and there, and especially
in connection with the Moravian settlements in Bethlehem, Pa., where was
established the first music school.

We find the first mention of an orchestra made in connection with a
performance of "The Beggar's Opera" at Upper Marlboro, Md., in 1752, and
a few years later (1788) a great concert was given in Philadelphia with
an orchestra of fifty and a chorus of two hundred performers.

There is also a record of a concert given in Charleston, S. C., in 1796,
when an orchestra of thirty instruments was employed in a performance of
Gluck's overture to "Iphegenie en Aulide," and Haydn's "Stabat Mater."

It is quite possible that orchestras were used more or less in other
concerts. Mr. Sonneck shows, in his "Early Concert-Life in America,"
many programs in which orchestral works are mentioned. And it is well to
state here that it is almost impossible to locate the first performance
in America of many of the works of the older composers, including Haydn
and Mozart, because no opus number is mentioned, nor anything to
indicate the identity of the work. Pleyel, Gluck and Clementi were much
in vogue.

The American composer was beginning to be heard from during this period.
Francis Hopkinson, who is generally regarded as the first American
composer, wrote, in 1759, a song with the title "My Days Have Been So
Wondrous Free." Some time later, in 1788, a small volume of songs was
published under the title "Seven Songs," by the same composer.

Francis Hopkinson was a well-educated man, a signer of the Declaration
of Independence, a member of the Convention of 1787 which formulated the
Constitution of the United States, first Judge of the Admiralty Court in
Pennsylvania, and author of many pamphlets and poems.

A man of entirely different calibre was William Billings, who was
considered the first composer in New England. His compositions were
chiefly "fuguing tunes," and he published several psalm books.

Billings was a tanner by trade, but a great musical enthusiast and
organizer. The Stoughton (Mass.) Musical Society, which is the oldest
musical society still in existence, was organized by Billings. Lack of
education was no bar to his activities, and he accomplished much with
very limited means.

It is said that Billings introduced the bass viol into the services of
the Church, and thus began to break down the ancient Puritanical
prejudices against musical instruments. He was also the first to use the
pitch-pipe in order to ensure some degree of certainty in "striking up
the tune" in church.

Again, we find the first American ballad operas during this period.
Benjamin Carr, an Englishman who had been in America a couple of years,
produced in 1796 a ballad opera, "The Archers of Switzerland," and,
shortly afterwards, in the same year, with Pellesier (a Frenchman of
recent arrival) as librettist, another ballad opera, "Edwin and
Angelina," was staged in New York City. Though these works could hardly
be called distinctively American, they were the first composed and
produced in this country.

During the last decade of the 18th century some French actors and
singers invaded the country and made New Orleans their headquarters.
From that time on, for many years, New Orleans was prominent in the
production of French operas and plays.

Theatres were built in several of the larger cities, and noted singers
began to appear from abroad. The first of these appears to have been
Miss Broadhurst, who appeared in Philadelphia in 1793, at the Chestnut
Street Theatre. She was closely followed by Mrs. Oldmixon.

  1750. April 30. "The Mock Doctor," and Dec. 3, "The Beggar's
    Opera," given at the "Theatre in Nassau St.," New York City.

    Bethlehem, Pa.

    Conscious Lovers" followed by the ballad farce, "Damon and
    Phillida," given by Lewis Hallam's company.

      Boston, replacing the Brattle organ.

  1756. The first mention of French horns in America made by

CHAPTER III

1800-1825


In 1800 we find the first mention of the use of the bassoon. This was in
Bethlehem, Pa., and it seems to complete the list of instruments for the
average orchestra. Notwithstanding the record of the importation of
oboes, many years earlier, and the fact that Graupner, one of the
leading musicians in Boston about this time, was, or had been an
oboeist, some historian has stated that even well into the nineteenth
century there was only one oboe player in the United States, and he
lived in Baltimore. Surely this must be an error.

In December 1800 we find the first annual concert of the Philharmonic
Society in New York City. This society died in a few years, and in 1820
another Philharmonic Society was formed. This society also dwindled,
though it did not die, for in 1840 it was reorganized, and has ever
since taken a leading part in the musical life of New York.

Many musical societies made a beginning. Few lived long. But of those
which lived perhaps the most noted is the Handel and Haydn Society of
Boston, formed in 1815. This society gave what was claimed to be the
first complete performance of Handel's "Messiah," but it is also
claimed that this was done in 1801 in the hall of the University of
Pennsylvania.

The Handel and Haydn Society also gave what was called the first
complete performance of Haydn's "Creation," an honor which is also
ascribed to King's Chapel in 1816, while portions had been performed in
1811 at Bethlehem, Pa. Thus it is difficult to fix definitely the first
performances of many of the large works. In later days, especially in
the case of Wagner's operas, portions were given at concerts long before
complete stage performances were essayed.

Another musical society which is in existence at the present day, and
which undoubtedly has had much influence on the musical life of America,
was the Pierian Sodality of Harvard University, established in 1808 by
the undergraduates.

In Philadelphia we find the establishment of the Musical Fund Society,
which, for a number of years, did much to promote good music in that
city. At its first concert, on April 24, 1821, Beethoven's First
Symphony was played for the first time in America. Mr. Goepp gives us a
full account of this and tells us that the whole symphony was too severe
a task for an audience of that period, so the performance was broken and
diversified by vocal and other solos between the movements.

New England possessed several musical societies in 1821, by which
performances of oratorio were given. The Sacred Music Society was
formed in New York City in 1823 and lasted till 1849. So it may easily
be seen that, as the population increased, musical societies were soon
established.

Theatres, while not strictly part of the musical life of the country,
can hardly be separated from it because they were the home of ballad
operas, and all musical stage representations. They were already in
existence in New York, Boston, and Philadelphia before the beginning of
the nineteenth century, but we find in 1807, the opening of "Le Theatre
St. Philippe" in New Orleans with Mehul's one-act opera, "Une Folie."
This theatre being burned in 1817, a new one, "Le Theatre d'Orleans,"
was built and opened in the following year. This theatre was the finest
in the country at that time and was the home of opera for a number of
years. The record of opera in New Orleans is incomplete, but it is well
known that New Orleans was the home of French opera in America long
before it became popular in other parts of the country.

But America was gradually edging up to the time of grand opera. Singers
were arriving from abroad and brought with them their ambitions. We find
that an English version of Rossini's opera, "Il Barbiere," was given at
the Park Theatre, New York City, in 1819, with Miss Leesugg as Rosina,
and in 1823 an English version of Mozart's "Le Nozze di Figaro" was
presented. Again in the early part of 1825, Weber's opera "Der
Freyschuetz" was presented, in English, at the Park Theatre, with Miss
Kelly and Mrs. de Luce in the leading parts. Similar performances
followed in other cities, and the country was thus gradually prepared
for the real thing,--grand opera,--in its native language.

While the record of items during the period 1800 to 1825 is not very
long it still shows considerable progress. The people grew up in a
country where there was little musical cultivation, where there were
small communities, and where the struggle for existence had been the
first consideration. They responded warmly to the efforts of the country
singing teacher, the choral society promoter, and later to the producer
of opera, and if history shows many failures, it may be pointed out that
these failures could not have taken place if no effort had been made.
Perhaps efforts in many cases were premature. Also there was much to
learn in the management of masses of people. The virtues of a true
democracy are nowhere more necessary than in a choral society.

CHAPTER IV

1825-1850


During these twenty-five years the list of items on record is far
greater than during any preceding period of similar time. Possibly this
may be accounted for by the greater facilities for travel both by sea
and land. Railroads were gradually spreading out through the country,
and helping to develop distant trading stations into towns and cities.
Steamships were making the voyage from Europe a more feasible adventure.
We shall see this as we proceed.

In what we may call the domestic side of music we find the establishment
of more singing societies in all the eastern cities. There was
practically no "west" in 1825, but Chicago shows up in 1834 with "The
Old Settlers' Harmonic Society." The story of Chicago's early musical
days may be read in Mr. George P. Upton's book of reminiscences. The
remarkable part of it seems to be that Chicago grew phenomenally, and
today stands as a rival to New York in all matters musical, although in
1825 Chicago was merely a trading post and New York was already a city
of some size.

The musical convention came into being. The first is said to have been
held at Concord, N. H., in September 1829. There is also a claim that
the first musical convention was held in Montpelier, Vt., in 1839 but
this is not quite correct. It may have been the first convention in
Vermont. Musical conventions became popular and frequent and are so even
to the present day, though the methods and matter have changed with the
times.

Another item which may come under the head of domestic music is the
beginning of music teaching in the public schools. This was effected by
Lowell Mason, as an experiment, in 1838. At the present day chorus
singing in the public schools has become an important matter, and is
almost universal.

In 1838 we find a Philharmonic Society in St. Louis, showing that St.
Louis was not far behind Chicago in getting into the musical world.

In Boston an Academy of Music was established by Lowell Mason in 1833.
It had a large number of pupils, and there was an orchestra in
connection with it, which gave several concerts. But the Harvard Musical
Association, which was founded in 1837, seems to have been the chief
propelling power to orchestral music in Boston, until the formation of
the Boston Symphony Orchestra. In New York the Philharmonic Society was
reorganized and was, as it has been ever since, the most prominent
orchestral organization of that city.

In 1848 two complete orchestras came to America, Gungl's, which gave a
number of concerts, chiefly of light music, and the Germania, which
consisted of a number of refugees from the German government. These men
gave concerts of a finer type than had yet been given in America. Their
career as an organization was not long, and it ended in disaster, but
many of the members became prominent in musical matters in various
cities, and in this way the Germania orchestra had a beneficial and
lasting effect upon music in this country.

In the forties began the stream of violin and piano virtuosi which has
continued in ever-increasing volume to the present day. Ole Bull,
violinist, in 1843, Vieuxtemps and Artot, violinists, and Leopold von
Meyer, pianist, in 1844, were the first.

Perhaps the development of opera may be considered of greater interest
than other musical items. In 1825 Manuel Garcia arrived in New York, and
gave the first performances of Italian opera. In his company were his
daughter Maria, who married one Malibran and remained in New York for
about two years. At the end of this time she left her husband and
returned to Europe, where she had a short but very brilliant career.
Young Garcia, the son, who also sang, afterwards became one of the
greatest singing teachers in Europe, and invented the laryngoscope.
Pauline, who became Madame Viardot, and lived to a great age, was too
young to participate in Garcia's performances in New York. For many
years she was one of the great singing teachers in Paris.

Garcia did not stay very long in New York, but he began the efforts to
present Italian opera, which were continued by many others from time to
time, usually with disaster. Nevertheless, the history of the period
from 1825 to 1850 is full of first performances of Italian opera. In
1848 the Havana Company visited the United States, and was considered
the finest company that had been heard until that time.

In the same year Max Maretzek appeared in New York and at once entered
the operatic field, with which he was prominently occupied during the
next period.

Before finishing the review of this period we must not forget the
production William Henry Fry's opera, "Leonora." This was the first
grand opera written and produced by an American. It had several
representations, but does not seem to have lived long. The same,
however, may be said of many of the Italian operas which were presented
during this and later periods. A careful perusal of the list will show
the names of operas long since defunct, so far as the American public is
concerned. Yet there are many, which were first presented to the
American public in this period, and which are as popular today as
ever,--in fact no good opera company can afford to be without them.
Opera was well started by 1850.

      (later a renowned vocal teacher, and inventor of the laryngoscope),
      his daughter, Maria Felicite (the great Malibran),
      his daughter Pauline (later Madame Viardot, one of the
      great vocal teachers of Paris) and others of less note.

CHAPTER V

1850-1875


During this period musical events moved forward quite rapidly, and
though there was a pause during the years of the Civil War--from 1861 to
1865--after that time increasing energy was in evidence.

Possibly one of the most significant events was the establishment of
"Dwight's Journal of Music," in Boston, the first journal in America
devoted entirely to musical matters. It was published every two weeks,
and while the greater part of the space was devoted to musical affairs
in Europe, yet there were letters and reports from various centres in
this country, which make the Journal something of a history in itself.
Moreover, John S. Dwight helped very materially in bringing to the
American people something in the way of musical criticism, which was
sadly needed. Indeed, anyone who takes the trouble to look over the
reports of concerts and operas in the daily papers of these times will
be surprised at the absurdity of the comments on the performances of the
noted musicians. Ritter, for instance, quotes a criticism of a
pianoforte recital where the critic was much pleased by a "double run on
the chromatic scale, in which the semitones were distinctly heard."
With singers the chief point was whether the singer of this season could
sing louder than the singer of last season. John S. Dwight was the
pioneer of musical criticism in America,--an intellectual man, one of
the noted band of idealists who were in the "Brook Farm" movement.
"Dwight's Journal of Music" went out of existence in 1881. Musical
criticism has since become a specialized art.

Musical societies were multiplying,--Cincinnati and Milwaukee had them,
and in Chicago the "Philharmonic Society" was organized. In 1850 also
the Worcester (Mass.) "Festivals" began, and in 1858 the Peabody
Institute concerts, in Baltimore.

In 1858 the "Mendelssohn Quintet" was formed, and for many years toured
the country giving concerts of a high standard, and doing much to raise
the level of musical taste. This organization had its beginning in
Boston, but it traveled so widely that it may be said to have belonged
to the nation.

Towards the end of this period the "Apollo Club" was organized in
Chicago, and it is today one of the most excellent clubs in America. The
following year the "Cecilia Society," in Boston, was organized and
likewise still exists and flourishes. But these are only a few.

The American composer was beginning to show himself--perhaps not yet
very brilliantly in comparison to the great men of Europe--but he was
beginning to be heard from. William H. Frye, besides his two operas,
composed several symphonies, which were played by Jullien's Band in
1853. Also a "Grand Symphony" in 1855 and "The Pilgrims' Cantata" by C.
C. Perkins, were performed in Boston, and we have record of an oratorio,
"The Cities of the Plains," by Dawley, in 1855. Apart from these efforts
the American composer seems to have been inconspicuous. In fact there
were no facilities for the study of music or for the hearing of music
which could be compared, as a training school for composers, with the
musical centres of Europe, so that the efforts of these earlier
composers may be considered, in some respects, premature, and prompted
by energy and ambition rather than by scientific preparation.

The story of grand opera of this period is one of perpetual striving for
the unattainable. In Chicago the first performance of grand opera was
given in 1850. Chicago is now a rival of New York in matters of opera.

San Francisco heard its first opera in 1853. The gold fever of 1849 drew
people of all kinds to California, and among them were musicians. Henri
Herz, the French pianist, reached California in 1849 when the excitement
was at its highest, and he gives an interesting account of his
adventures. It may also be well to mention here Signora Biscaccianti,
who went to San Francisco in 1852, and was there more or less till 1864.
Signora Biscaccianti was one of the first American singers to achieve a
measure of success in Europe. She was the daughter of a musician named
Ostinelli, was born in Boston, where she met with some success as a
singer, went to New York and thence to Europe. Another American who was,
perhaps, better known in her own country was Miss Isabella Hinkley who
appeared in 1861, but another who appeared in New York in the same year,
became still better known and was prominent for many years, Clara Louise
Kellogg. Eighteen hundred and fifty-nine was the year of Adelina Patti's
debut.

The list of great singers who were imported during this period is long.
We can but touch on it,--there was Jenny Lind in 1850, then came
Marietta Alboni in 1851. Two years later Sontag, and the next year Grisi
and Mario. In 1865 came Parepa Rosa, and in 1870 Christine Nilsson. In
1873, Maurel and Campanini. In 1855 Brignoli appeared, and was for many
years a great popular favorite.

We find efforts in New York to promote German opera. Operas by
Germans--"Fidelio" for instance--had been heard together with operas by
Italians, and others, but now Wagner came above the horizon, and German
opera began to mean Wagner. So we find a "Tannhaeuser" and "Lohengrin" in
New York in 1859,--quite inadequate performances according to the
opinion handed down to posterity,--but yet, performances. They were
followed in 1862 by "Der Fliegende Hollaender," all worthy but
inadequate efforts. Maretzek and Strakosch were the chief figures in
grand opera during this period, but there were spasmodic efforts by
others which need not be recorded.

Pianists were not so numerous as later. Alfred Jaell had appeared and,
in 1854, Dr. William Mason returned from Europe and established himself
in New York, but was not known as one of the traveling virtuosi. He had
a great influence in musical education, for many years. Anna Mehlig
visited America in 1869.

In 1862 Louis M. Gottschalk, a native of New Orleans, returned to
America after a brilliant career in Europe, and he appears to have been
the first American to have made a career as a piano virtuoso.

Violinists were few in comparison to singers,--Miska Hauser, Pablo
Sarasate, in 1850, and Camilla Urso in 1852. Then a space of twenty
years without any great virtuoso.

An important matter in the musical life of America was the establishment
of conservatories. There had already been the Academy of Music in
Boston, which enrolled twenty-two hundred pupils the first year, but the
conservatory idea appears to have developed just after the Civil War,
for we find in 1865 a conservatory of music established with Oberlin
College, in 1871 Illinois College at Jacksonville followed suit, and in
1873 Northwestern University. In the meantime, in 1867, we find the
Boston Conservatory, under Julius Eichberg, the New England
Conservatory, under Eben Tourjee, the Cincinnati Conservatory, and the
Chicago Academy of Music, which became the Chicago Musical College,--and
in 1877, a couple of years after this period, Syracuse University added
a conservatory.

CHAPTER VI

1875-1890


The period of fifteen years from 1875 to 1890 was most certainly a
period of progress. Not only was the country growing rapidly in
population and wealth, but means of communication were much greater and
more efficient than in the preceding years. The present writer well
remembers a journey from San Francisco to St. Louis, and on to Boston in
1878, when there was one single track railroad between Oakland and
Omaha. Cheyenne consisted of two rows of primitive looking wooden
houses, behind which were "anchored" many emigrants' wagons, or "prairie
schooners" as they were called. Only a few years later (in the early
eighties) Colonel Mapleson visited Cheyenne with his opera company,
which included Patti and Gerster, and wrote thus of the place: "Although
Cheyenne is but a little town, consisting of about two streets, it
possesses a most refined society, composed, it is true, of cow-boys; yet
one might have imagined oneself at the London Opera when the curtain
rose,--the ladies in brilliant toilettes and covered with diamonds; the
gentlemen all in evening dress. The entire little town is lighted by
electricity. The club-house is one of the pleasantest I have ever
visited, and the people are most hospitable."

This account reminds the writer of a visit, not so many years ago, to
Oklahoma City where the ladies resembled those of Cheyenne. There was,
however, but one gentleman, within the writer's range of vision, in
evening dress. And when Mapleson visited Cheyenne Oklahoma was an Indian
reservation. Thus has civilization advanced.

In 1875 San Francisco was already a good-sized city, but almost the
whole country between San Francisco and Chicago and St. Louis has been
developed since 1875.

In San Francisco we find the establishment of the "Loring Club" in 1877.
But good music was getting its roots in deeper in the East. In New York
the "Symphony Society" was founded by Dr. Leopold Damrosch in 1878, and
was followed in 1881 by the "Boston Symphony Orchestra," which was
established through the liberality of Major Henry L. Higginson.

"The Music Teachers' National Association" was also formed in 1876, and
while it is not in the public eye in the way that opera and concerts
are, yet its influence throughout the land has been very marked, and has
led to state associations, with their annual conferences, and exchanges
of views among teachers.

In the concert world we find the names of several
celebrities,--Rubinstein had visited America in 1872, and Hans von Buelow
in 1875, Moritz Rosenthal in 1888, and Godowski in 1890. We find also
among the noted pianists who were first known here in this period
Arabella Goddard, Rafael Joseffy, Fanny Bloomfield-Zeisler and Josef
Hofmann.

Some noted violinists also visited America, August Wilhelmj in 1878,
Ovide Musin, Teresina Tua, and in 1888 Fritz Kreisler. But perhaps the
most noteworthy event was the appearance of Maud Powell, an American
woman, whose career placed her in the front rank of violinists, and has
but recently ended with her death.

Of singers there were a great many, but most of them appeared in opera.
Of the Americans who gained international reputation were Emma Abbott,
Alwina Valleria (of Baltimore), Lillian Nordica (Norton), Emma Nevada
(Wixom), and Charles R. Adams.

Among the European celebrities who visited America were Madame
Rudersdorff, Etelka Gerster, Scalchi, Marcella Senibrich, Amalia
Materna, and Lilli Lehmann, also Alberto Stagno, Max Alvary, Albert
Niemann, Francesco Tarnagno.

This leads us to a short review of opera, and as New York City was the
headquarters from which numerous companies issued to charm the rest of
the country, a review of New York is practically a review of opera for
the whole country.

From 1850 to 1875 opera is said to have "flourished on failure" chiefly
under Maretzek and Strakosch. Also, opera meant Italian opera, or at
least opera in Italian. There were spasmodic efforts to promote German
opera, chiefly by Adolf Neuendorff, who managed the German Theatre in
New York City from 1872 to 1883. In 1876 a Wagner Festival was given in
New York, and in 1878 there was a short and unsuccessful season given by
the Pappenheim Opera Company, during which "Rienzi" was sung for the
first time in America. Theodore Thomas did much to prepare the way by
playing excerpts from the Wagner operas at his concerts, but Dr. Leopold
Damrosch in 1884 set on foot a movement which, during the next few
years, brought to America several of the greatest German singers, and
gave to the public adequate representations of many of the Wagnerian
operas. Dr. Damrosch died in 1885 and his work was taken up by Anton
Seidl, who had been associated with Wagner in the production of the
"Ring" at Beyreuth. Under Seidl "Die Meistersinger" had its first
performance in America, in 1886; "Tristan und Isolde" and "Siegfried" in
1887; "Die Goetterdaemmerung," in 1888, and "Das Rheingold" in 1889. Thus
German opera was well launched in this period.

To return to Italian opera,--Colonel Mapleson invaded the United States
in 1878 bringing with him a good company of singers. He did not go
farther west than St. Louis. Several tours followed in succeeding years.
During his third tour he gave the first performance in America of
Boito's "Mefistofele," with Campanini, Valleria, Cary and Novara. About
this time he found a strong competitor in Henry E. Abbey, who secured
Nilsson as a counter-attraction to Patti who was under Mapleson. This
competition caused Mapleson to proceed farther west, so he led his
company as far as San Francisco, where he appears to have taken the town
by storm, and, if his account is correct, the march in "Aida" was
performed by six hundred of the State militia and he had the assistance
of a military band and an extra chorus of three hundred and fifty
voices. But Mapleson's enterprises were beset with difficulties and
finally ended in disaster, although not for some years. To many people,
who can remember the rivalry between Abbey and Mapleson in the eighties,
when Patti, Gerster, Sembrich, Scalchi, Nilsson, Annie Louise Cary,
Campanini, Ravelli and del Puente were in their prime, these were the
days of Italian opera in America. Probably much was lacking in the
staging and scenery, but the singers have been unsurpassed.

Before closing the review of this period we come to that which is of
immense importance in the development of music in America, viz. the
appearance of a number of composers who have taken high rank among the
composers of the world;--John K. Paine, whose first symphony was
produced in 1875, was followed shortly by Arthur Bird, George W.
Chadwick, Horatio Parker, Harry Rowe Shelley, Dudley Buck and Edward A.
MacDowell. Nothing speaks more eloquently of the progress of music in
America than the work of these men, and of several others of smaller
achievements.

CHAPTER VII

1890-1900


The decade covered in this chapter was remarkable for progress in many
directions.

Large orchestras were established all over the country--Pittsburgh,
Cincinnati, San Francisco, Los Angeles, widely scattered cities, were
among those which made serious efforts in the orchestral line, and
performed large orchestral works.

America became in a still greater degree the hunting ground of the
musical star who came from Europe, and swept the country of its loose
dollars, appearing both as soloist with these orchestras, and giving
recitals in the various cities.

Among pianists we had Busoni, who was, for a time, resident in Boston,
Vladimir de Pachmann, the great interpreter of Chopin, who was immensely
popular for some twenty-five years, and Paderewski, whose progress
through the country was marked by previously unheard of demonstrations.
It is said that thousands of people traveled many miles to see the train
pass in which he was traveling. Alfred Reisenauer came in 1895,
Slivinski, Alberto Jonas, Raoul Pugno, Siloti and Dohnanyi, were among
those who made their first appearances in America during this decade.

There was also a large list of violin virtuosi beginning with Adolf
Brodsky, who was followed by Henri Marteau, Cesar Thomson, Ondriczek,
Burmester, Halir, Gregorovitch, Marsick, Maud MacCarthy, Petschnikof and
Madame Normann Neruda, who had been prominent in England for many years,
and was long past her prime when she visited America. But the greatest
artist of all was Eugen Ysaye, who first appeared in 1894, and who,
since the great war, has been conductor of the Cincinnati Orchestra.

Opera continued to flourish on misfortune. Henry Abbey, who had ruined
himself in driving out Mapleson, formed a partnership with John B.
Schoeffel and Maurice Grau, and for some years provided opera for the
country. Signor Luigi Arditi, who first appeared as conductor of the
Havana Company in about 1848, and had seen more operatic service in
America than any other conductor, made a brief but interesting estimate
of the impresarios under whom he had traveled during those years. "I
have come to the conclusion," he writes, "that Don Francesco Marty (of
the Havana Company) was the most generous of men, and Max Maretzek the
cleverest. Colonel Mapleson was decidedly the astutest of all directors,
... while to Henry Abbey must be attributed every straightforward and
honorable quality. Maurice Grau was the cleverest of _entrepreneurs_."

Among the singers brought here by this combination was Tamagno, who
appeared in 1890. The following season came Jean and Edouard de Reszke,
who reigned supreme for a number of years. Also two American singers who
had made reputations abroad,--Emma Eames and Marie van Zandt. In 1893
Nellie Melba and Emma Calve came; and in 1894 Pol Plancon. In 1896 the
Abbey and Grau combination collapsed. Abbey died soon after, and Grau
continued alone until 1903.

In 1895 Walter Damrosch made an effort, which extended over several
years, to reestablish German opera, at the Metropolitan Opera House.
This house, by the way, had been burned down in 1892, but was rebuilt
and opened again in the following year. Several new singers were brought
over from Germany, among them being Johanna Gadski.

In 1897 and 1898 Walter Damrosch joined forces with Charles A. Ellis,
the manager of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, who had already been
managing a company of which Melba was the star.

In 1896 Ernestine Schumann-Heink made her first American appearance in
Chicago, and the following year joined the Metropolitan Company. Also
Milka Ternina, an excellent artist, made her first appearance in Boston.

In 1898 Maurice Grau was the leading operatic impresario once more and
introduced several new singers, including Marie Brema, Suzanne Adams, an
American, and Marie Engle, also in 1900 another American, Louise Homer,
while of the men Albert Alvarez, a French tenor, and Antonio Scotti, an
Italian baritone, were the most brilliant stars.

Italian opera was now being pushed hard by German opera, while French
opera was very little heard. The table of performances published in New
York at the end of the season 1900-1901 shows that Wagner had
thirty-four performances out of a total of eighty-six. Gounod was next
with twelve performances, Verdi with eight, Puccini with eight,
Meyerbeer with five, Mascagni with four, Reyer and Massenet three each,
Boito, Mozart and Donizetti two each, and Beethoven, Leoncavallo and
Bizet one each.

American composers were seeking new themes indigenous to the soil. Many
had already written something under the title of "Rip van Winkle," and
Walter Damrosch had brought out an opera based on Hawthorne's novel "The
Scarlet Letter." Anton Dvo[vr]ak composed his "New World Symphony"
making use of negro melodies for his themes. The resources of the
Indians, the prairies and the mountains have been tapped more or less
successfully. The oil fields still offer a thrilling subject for the
composer.

CHAPTER VIII

1900


The first decade of the twentieth century was noteworthy for the
establishment of orchestras throughout the land. During the nineteenth
century the development of the resources of the country and the increase
of its wealth and population was phenomenal. In 1900 the population of
the United States was about seventy-five millions. Chicago, which was
practically non-existent in 1800, had a population of about two millions
and was already a rival of New York. Railroads, unknown at the beginning
of the nineteenth century, had covered the country with a network of
communications and caused the growth of large cities in places far
remote from the civilization of the year 1800.

We find Minneapolis establishing an orchestra in 1902, St. Paul in 1905,
New Orleans in 1906, Seattle in 1908, while the Symphony Society of New
York was reorganized in 1905, and a Russian Symphony orchestra
established in New York City. The term "Symphony Orchestra" has been
universally adopted, till we have symphony orchestras even in the moving
picture houses. In Grove's Dictionary (edition of 1890) the only
symphony orchestra mentioned is "the Boston Symphony Orchestra," though
the "Symphony Society" of New York is also listed. It seems then that
the term "symphony" applied to an orchestra is an American qualification
signifying complete equipment, and at least good intentions.

During this period the New York Philharmonic Society adopted the plan,
for three successive years, of engaging visiting, or guest conductors,
and in this way a number of the most prominent European conductors were
introduced to the American public.

A few American composers emerged, and of them the most frequently found
were Frederick S. Converse and Henry K. Hadley, of whose works several
were produced by the leading orchestras and opera companies.

The list of virtuosi is also long. Among pianists Harold Bauer and Ossip
Gabrilovitsch appeared in 1900, and later came Rudolf Ganz, Josef
Lhevinne, Katherine Goodson, and Serge Rachmaninof. Among violinists,
Kubelik, Kocian, Hugo Heermann, Jacques Thibaud, Efrem Zimbalist and
Arthur Spalding, only the last being of American birth.

The list of singers is long, and is chiefly associated with opera.
Louise Homer, an American, made her debut in 1900, and Geraldine Farrar,
another American, in 1906. Among other noted singers we find, Lucienne
Breval, Caruso, Fremstad, Tetrazzini, Bonci, Renaud, Chaliapin, Morena,
Destinn, Mary Garden, John McCormack, Edouard Clement, and
Slezak,--samples of many nationalities.

This brings us to the opera. Maurice Grau resigned from the directorship
of the Metropolitan Opera House in 1903. Grau brought the star system to
a climax, and gave opera with "all star casts," but few new operas were
presented under his management. In 1903 Heinrich Conried succeeded to
the management of the Metropolitan Opera House, and set himself to work
to abolish the star system, as far as possible, and produce a good
ensemble. The abolition of the star system proved an impossibility,
because people had been fed upon it since the musical life of the
country began, and New York audiences would not go to hear singers who
had not already made European reputations. But Mr. Conried succeeded in
producing many works new to the American public. Of these "Parsifal"
stands forth conspicuously, though he found a competitor in Henry W.
Savage, who produced "Parsifal" in English a few days in advance of Mr.
Conried's production. This was followed in 1906 by Strauss's "Salome."
Conried died in 1908 and was succeeded by the dual control of Signor
Gatti-Casazza and Andreas Dippel, but Dippel soon resigned and went to
Chicago, and from that date until the present (1922) Signor
Gatti-Casazza has been sole manager of the Metropolitan Opera House.

In 1906 Oscar Hammerstein opened the Manhattan Opera House in New York
City and instituted a strong rivalry with the Metropolitan. He brought
to America some excellent singers and presented many works new to the
American public. While the Metropolitan company gave more German than
French or Italian opera, the Manhattan seemed to tend towards a
preponderance of French opera. The rivalry was beneficial to the public
if not to the stockholders.

We find during this period an opera, "The Pipe of Desire," by Frederick
S. Converse, the first American opera to be presented at the
Metropolitan Opera House. All the principals, with one exception, were
also of American birth,--Louise Homer, Riccardo Martin, Clarence
Whitehill and Herbert Witherspoon. The other principal was Lenora
Sparks, an English singer.

The most notable feature of the decade seems to have been the spread of
musical enterprise throughout the country. Distant cities were
organizing choral societies and orchestras to a greater extent than ever
before. It is necessary not only to develop composers, support a few
fine orchestras and produce a few operas, but the nation must grow
musically as a whole. The support given to musical enterprise depends on
the education of the rising generation, and must begin with the schools.

book was produced from scanned images of public domain
material from the Google Print project.)


Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
