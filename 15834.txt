THE BOOK OF JOYOUS CHILDREN


  Bound and bordered in leaf-green,
    Edged with trellised buds and flowers
  And glad Summer-gold, with clean
      White and purple morning-glories
      Such as suit the songs and stories
    Of this book of ours,
  Unrevised in text or scene,--
        The Book of Joyous Children.

  Wild and breathless in their glee--
    Lawless rangers of all ways
  Winding through lush greenery
      Of Elysian vales--the viny,
      Bowery groves of shady, shiny
    Haunts of childish days.
  Spread and read again with me
        The Book of Joyous Children.

  What a whir of wings, and what
    Sudden drench of dews upon
  The young brows, wreathed, all unsought,
      With the apple-blossom garlands
      Of the poets of those far lands
    Whence all dreams are drawn
  Set herein and soiling not
        The Book of Joyous Children.

  In their blithe companionship
    Taste again, these pages through,
  The hot honey on your lip
      Of the sun-smit wild strawberry,
      Or the chill tart of the cherry;
    Kneel, all glowing, to
  The cool spring, and with it sip
        The Book of Joyous Children.

  As their laughter needs no rule,
    So accept their language, pray.--
  Touch it not with any tool:
      Surely we may understand it,--
      As the heart has parsed or scanned it
    Is a worthy way,
  Though found not in any School
        The Book of Joyous Children.


[Illustration: "KNEEL, ALL GLOWING, TO THE COOL SPRING."]


  Be a truant--know no place
    Of prison under heaven's rim!
  Front the Father's smiling face--
      Smiling, that _you_ smile the brighter
      For the heavy hearts made lighter,
    Since you smile with Him.
  Take--and thank Him for His grace--
        The Book of Joyous Children.

AN IMPROMPTU FAIRY-TALE


[Illustration]


  _When I wuz ist a little bit_
      _o' weenty-teenty kid_
  _I maked up a Fairy-tale,_
      _all by myse'f, I did:--_



  I

  Wunst upon a time wunst
    They wuz a Fairy King,
  An' ever'thing he have wuz _gold--_,
    His clo'es, an' _ever_'thing!
  An' all the other Fairies
    In his goldun Palace-hall
  Had to hump an' hustle--
    'Cause he wuz bosst of all!



  II

  He have a goldun trumput,
    An' when he blow' on that,
  It's a sign he want' his boots,
    Er his coat er hat:
  They's a sign fer ever'thing,--
    An' all the Fairies knowed
  Ever' sign, an' come a-hoppin'
    When the King blowed!


[Illustration]



  III

  Wunst he blowed an' telled 'em all:
    "Saddle up yer bees--
  Fireflies is gittin' fat
    An' sassy as you please!--
  Guess we'll go a-huntin'!"
    So they hunt' a little bit,
  Till the King blowed "Supper-time,"
    Nen they all quit.

  Nen they have a Banqut
    In the Palace-hall,
  An' ist et! an' et! an' et!
    Nen they have a _Ball_;
  An' when the _Queen_ o' Fairyland
    Come p'omenadin' through,
  The King says an' halts her,--
    "Guess I'll marry you!"

DREAM-MARCH


  "Wasn't it a funny dream!--perfectly bewild'rin'!--
    Last night, and night before, and night before that,
  Seemed like I saw the march o' regiments o' children,
    Marching to the robin's fife and cricket's rat-ta-tat!
  Lily-banners overhead, with the dew upon 'em,
    On flashed the little army, as with sword and flame;
  Like the buzz o' bumble-wings, with the honey on 'em,
    Came an eerie, cheery chant, chiming as it came:--

[Illustration]

  _Where go the children? Travelling! Travelling_!
    _Where go the children, travelling ahead_?
  _Some go to kindergarten; some go to day-school_;
    _Some go to night-school; and some go to bed_!

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

  Smooth roads or rough roads, warm or winter weather,
    On go the children, tow-head and brown,
  Brave boys and brave girls, rank and file together,
    Marching out of Morning-Land, over dale and down:

[Illustration]

  Some go a-gypsying out in country places--
    Out through the orchards, with blossoms on the boughs
  Wild, sweet, and pink and white as their own glad faces;
    And some go, at evening, calling home the cows.

[Illustration]

  _Where go the children? Travelling! Travelling_!
    _Where go the children, travelling ahead_?
  _Some go to foreign wars, and camps by the firelight_--
    _Some go to glory so; and some go to bed_!

[Illustration]

  Some go through grassy lanes leading to the city--
    Thinner grow the green trees and thicker grows the dust;
  Ever, though, to little people any path is pretty
    So it leads to newer lands, as they know it must.
  Some go to singing less; some go to list'ning;
    Some go to thinking over ever-nobler themes;
  Some go anhungered, but ever bravely whistling,
    Turning never home again only in their dreams.

  _Where go the children? Travelling! Travelling_!
    _Where go the children, travelling ahead_?
  _Some go to conquer things; some go to try them_;
    _Some go to dream them; and some go to bed_!

ELMER BROWN


[Illustration]

  Awf'lest boy in this-here town
  Er anywheres is Elmer Brown!
  He'll mock you--yes, an' strangers, too,
  An' make a face an' yell at you,--
    "_Here's_ the way _you_ look!"

[Illustration]

  Yes, an' wunst in School one day,
  An' Teacher's lookin' wite that way,
  He helt his slate, an' hide his head,
  An' maked a face at _her_, an' said,--
    "_Here's_ the way _you_ look!"

[Illustration]

  An' sir! when Rosie Wheeler smile
  One morning at him 'crosst the aisle,
  He twist his face all up, an' black
  His nose wiv ink, an' whisper back,--
    "_Here's_ the way _you_ look!"

[Illustration]

  Wunst when his Aunt's all dressed to call,
  An' kiss him good-bye in the hall,
  An' latch the gate an' start away,
  He holler out to her an' say,--
    "_Here's_ the way _you_ look!"

[Illustration]

  An' when his Pa he read out loud
  The speech he maked, an' feel so proud
  It's in the paper--Elmer's Ma
  She ketched him--wite behind his Pa,--
    "_Here's_ the way _you_ look!"

[Illustration]

  Nen when his Ma she slip an' take
  Him in the other room an' shake
  Him good! w'y, he don't care--no-_sir_!--
  He ist look up an' laugh at her,--
    "_Here's_ the way _you_ look!"

NO BOY KNOWS


  There are many things that boys may know--
  Why this and that are thus and so,--
  Who made the world in the dark and lit
  The great sun up to lighten it:
  Boys know new things every day--
  When they study, or when they play,--
  When they idle, or sow and reap--
  But no boy knows when he goes to sleep.

  Boys who listen--or should, at least,--
  May know that the round old earth rolls East;--
  And know that the ice and the snow and the rain--
  Ever repeating their parts again--
  Are all just water the sunbeams first
  Sip from the earth in their endless thirst,
  And pour again till the low streams leap.--
  But no boy knows when he goes to sleep.

  A boy may know what a long glad while
  It has been to him since the dawn's first smile,
  When forth he fared in the realm divine
  Of brook-laced woodland and spun-sunshine;--
  He may know each call of his truant mates,
  And the paths they went,--and the pasture-gates
  Of the 'cross-lots home through the dusk so deep.--
  But no boy knows when he goes to sleep.

  O I have followed me, o'er and o'er,
  From the flagrant drowse on the parlor-floor,
  To the pleading voice of the mother when
  I even doubted I heard it then--
  To the sense of a kiss, and a moonlit room,
  And dewy odors of locust-bloom--
  A sweet white cot--and a cricket's cheep.--
  But no boy knows when he goes to sleep.

WHEN WE FIRST PLAYED "SHOW"


  Wasn't it a good time,
      Long Time Ago--
  When we all were little tads
      And first played "Show"!--
  When every newer day
      Wore as bright a glow
  As the ones we laughed away--
      Long Time Ago!

  Calf was in the back-lot;
      Clover in the red;
  Bluebird in the pear-tree;
      Pigeons on the shed;
  Tom a-chargin' twenty pins
      At the barn; and Dan
  Spraddled out just like "The
      'Injarubber'-Man!"

  Me and Bub and Rusty,
      Eck and Dunk and Sid,
  'Tumblin' on the sawdust
      Like the A-rabs did;
  Jamesy on the slack-rope
    In a wild retreat,
  Grappling back, to start again--
    When he chalked his feet!

[Illustration]

  Wasn't Eck a wonder,
    In his stocking-tights?

  Wasn't Dunk--his leaping lion--
    Chief of all delights!
  Yes, and wasn't "Little Mack"
    Boss of all the Show,--
  Both Old Clown and Candy-Butcher--
    Long Time Ago!

  Sid the Bareback-Rider;
    And--oh-me-oh-_my_!--
  Bub, the spruce Ring-master,
    Stepping round so spry!--
  In his little waist-and-trousers
    All made in one,
  Was there a prouder youngster
    Under the sun!

  And NOW--who will tell me,--
    Where are they all?
  Dunk's a sanatorium doctor,
    Up at Waterfall;
  Sid's a city street-contractor;
    Tom has fifty clerks;
  And Jamesy he's the "Iron Magnate"
    Of "The Hecla Works."

  And Bub's old and bald now,
    Yet still he hangs on,--
  Dan and Eck and "Little Mack,"
      Long, long gone!
  But wasn't it a good time,
      Long Time Ago--
  When we all were little tads
      And first played "Show"!

    But Gracie dearly loved her doll,
      An' played wiv it on the winder-sill
  'Way up-stairs, when she ought to _not_,
    An' her muvver _telled_ her so an' all;
      But she won't _mind_ what _she_ say--till,
  First thing she know, her dolly fall
    Clean spang out o' the winder plumb
      Into the street! An' here Grace come
  Down-stairs, two at a time, ist wild
  An' a-screamin', "Oh, my child! my child!"

THE RAMBO-TREE


  When Autumn shakes the rambo-tree--
    It's a long, sweet way across the orchard!--
  The bird sings low as the bumble-bee--
    It's a long, sweet way across the orchard!--
  The poor shote-pig he says, says he:
  "When Autumn shakes the rambo-tree
  There's enough for you and enough for me."--
    It's a long, sweet way across the orchard.

  _For just two truant lads like we_,
  _When Autumn shakes the rambo-tree_
  _There's enough for you and enough for me_--
    _It's a long, sweet way across the orchard_.

  When Autumn shakes the rambo-tree--
    It's a long, sweet way across the orchard!--
  The mole digs out to peep and see--
    It's a long, sweet way across the orchard!--
  The dusk sags down, and the moon swings free,
  There's a far, lorn call, "Pig-_gee_! 'Pig-_gee_!"
  And two boys--glad enough for three.--
    It's a long, sweet way across the orchard.

  _For just two truant lads like we_,
  _When Autumn shakes the rambo-tree_
  _There's enough for you and enough for me_--
    _It's a long, sweet way across the orchard_.

  Our three cats is Maltese cats,
    An' they's two that's white,--
  An' bofe of 'em's _deef_--an' that's
    'Cause their _eyes_ ain't right.--

[Illustration]

  Uncle say that _Huxley_ say
    Eyes of _white_ Maltese--
  When they don't match thataway--
    They're deef as you please!

  _Girls, they_ like our white cats best,
    'Cause they're white as snow,
  Yes, an' look the stylishest--
    But they're deef, you know!

  They don't know their names, an' don't
    Hear us when we call
  "Come in, Nick an' Finn!"--they won't
    Come fer us at all!

  But our _other_ cat, _he_ knows
    Mister Nick an' Finn,--
  Mowg's _his_ name,--an' when _he_ goes
    Fer 'em, they come in!

  Mowgli's _all_ his name--the same
    Me an' Muvver took
  Like the Wolf-Child's _other_ name,
    In "The Jungul Book."

  I bet Mowg's the smartest cat
    In the world!--_He's_ not
  _White_, but mousy-plush, with that
    Smoky gloss he's got!

  All's got little bells to ring,
    Round their neck; but none
  Only Mowg _knows_ anything--
    He's the only one!

  I ist 'spect sometimes he hate
    White cats' stupid ways:--
  He won't hardly 'sociate
    With 'em, lots o' days!

  Mowg wants in where _we_ air,--well,
    He'll ist take his paw
  An' ist ring an' ring his bell
    There till me er Ma

  Er _some_body lets him in
    Nen an' shuts the door.--
  An', when he wants out ag'in,
    Nen he'll ring some more.

  Ort to hear our Katy tell!
    She sleeps 'way up-stairs;
  An' last night she hear Mowg's bell
    Ringin' round _some_wheres...

  Trees grows by her winder.--So,
    She lean out an' see
  Mowg up there, 'way out, you know,
    In the clingstone-tree;--

  An'-sir! he ist _hint_ an' _ring_,--
    Till she ketch an' plat
  Them limbs;--nen he crawl an' spring
    In where Katy's at!

THE BOY PATRIOT


  I want to be a Soldier!--
                    A Soldier!--
                        A Soldier!--
  I want to be a Soldier, with a sabre in my hand
  Or a little carbine rifle, or a musket on my shoulder,
  Or just a snare-drum, snarling in the middle of the band;
  I want to hear, high overhead, The Old Flag flap her wings
  While all the Army, following, in chorus cheers and sings;
  I want to hear the tramp and jar
    Of patriots a million,
  As gayly dancing off to war
    As dancing a cotillion.

  _I want to be a Soldier!_--
                    _A Soldier!_--
                        _A Soldier!_--
  _I want to be a Soldier, with a sabre in my hand_
  _Or a little carbine rifle, or a musket on my shoulder_,
  _Or just a snare-drum, snarling in the middle of the band_.

  I want to see the battle!--
                    The battle!--
                        The battle!--
  I want to see the battle, and be in it to the end;--
  I want to hear the cannon clear their throats and catch the prattle
  Of all the pretty compliments the enemy can send!--
  And then I know my wits will go,--and where I _should'nt_ be--
  Well, there's the spot, in any fight, that you may search for me.
  So, when our foes have had their fill,
    Though I'm among the dying,
  To see The Old Flag flying still,
    I'll laugh to leave her flying!

  _I want to be a Soldier!_--
                    _A Soldier!_--
                        _A Soldier!_--
  _I want to be a Soldier, with a sabre in my hand_
  _Or a little carbine rifle, or a musket on my shoulder_,
  _Or just a snare-drum, snarling in the middle of the band_.

  A little boy once played so loud
  That the Thunder, up in a thunder-cloud,
  Said, "Since I can't be heard, why, then
  I'll never, never thunder again!"

  That she heard a fly on the window-sill
  Whisper and say to a lady-bird,--
  "She's the stilliest child I ever heard!"

INTELLECTUAL LIMITATIONS


  Parunts knows lots more than us,

  'Cause we ketch 'em, lots o' times,
    Even on little small things.

  One time Winnie ask' her Ma,

  What's the wind a-doin' when
    It's a-not a-_blowin_'?

  Yes, an' 'Del', that very day,

  But, no; I'm wrong,--
  The sound's too long
  And all-alike to be a song!

  I think, "Well, there!
  I do declare,
  If it is neither song nor prayer,
  It's _talk_--and quite
  Too vain and light
  For me to listen to all night!"

  And so, I smile,
  And think,--"Now I'll
  Not listen for a little while!"--
  Then, sweet and clear,
  Next "_cheep_" I hear
  'S a _kiss_.... Good morning, Mommy dear!

A SESSION WITH UNCLE SIDNEY

[1869]


I

ONE OF HIS ANIMAL STORIES


  Now, Tudens, you sit on _this_ knee--and 'scuse
  It having no side-saddle on;--and, Jeems,
  You sit on _this_--and don't you wobble so
  And chug my old shins with your coppertoes;--
  And, all the rest of you, range round someway,--
  Ride on the rockers and hang to the arms
  Of our old-time splint-bottom carryall!--
  Do anything but _squabble_ for a place,
  Or push or shove or scrouge, or breathe _out loud_,
  Or chew wet, or knead taffy in my beard!--
  Do _any_thing almost--act _any_way,--
  Only _keep still_, so I can hear myself
  Trying to tell you "just one story more!"

  One winter afternoon my father, with
  A whistle to our dog, a shout to us--
  His two boys--six and eight years old we were,--
  Started off to the woods, a half a mile
  From home, where he was chopping wood. We raced,
  We slipped and slid; reaching, at last, the north
  Side of Tharp's corn-field.--There we struck what seemed
  To be a coon-track--so we all agreed:
  And father, who was not a hunter, to
  Our glad surprise, proposed we follow it.
  The snow was quite five inches deep; and we,
  Keen on the trail, were soon far in the woods.
  Our old dog, "Ring," ran nosing the fresh track
  With whimpering delight, far on ahead.
  After following the trail more than a mile
  To northward, through the thickest winter woods
  We boys had ever seen,--all suddenly
  He seemed to strike _another_ trail; and then
  Our joyful attention was drawn to
  Old "Ring"--leaping to this side, then to that,
  Of a big, hollow, old oak-tree, which had
  Been blown down by a storm some years before.
  There--all at once--out leapt a lean old fox
  From the black hollow of a big bent limb,--
  Hey! how he scudded!--but with our old "Ring"
  Sharp after him--and father after "Ring"--
  We after father, near as we could hold!
  And father noticed that the fox kept just
  About four feet ahead of "Ring"--just _that_--
  No farther, and no nearer! Then he said:--
  "There are young foxes in that tree back there,

       *       *       *       *       *

[Illustration: "A BIG, HOLLOW, OLD OAK-TREE, WHICH HAD BEEN BLOWN DOWN
BY A STORM."]

       *       *       *       *       *

  And the mother-fox is drawing 'Ring' and us
  Away from their nest there!" "Oh, le' 's go back!--
  Do le' 's go back!" we little vandals cried,--
  "Le' 's go back, quick, and find the little things--
  _Please_, father!--Yes, and take 'em home for pets--
  'Cause 'Ring' he'll kill the old fox anyway!"
  So father turned at last, and back we went,
  And father chopped a hole in the old tree
  About ten feet below the limb from which
  The old fox ran, and--Bless their little lives!--
  There, in the hollow of the old tree-trunk--
  There, on a bed of warm dry leaves and moss--
  There, snug as any bug in any rug--
  We found--one--two--three--four, and, yes-sir, _five_
  Wee, weenty-teenty baby-foxes, with
  Their eyes just barely opened--_Cute_?--my-oh!--
  _The_ cutest--the most cunning little things
  Two boys ever saw, in all their lives!
  "Raw weather for the little fellows _now_!"
  Said father, as though talking to himself,--
  "Raw weather, and no home _now_!"--And off came
  His warm old "waumus"; and in that he wrapped
  The helpless little animals, and held
  Them soft and warm against him as he could,--
  And home we happy children followed him.--
  _Old "Ring"_ did not reach home till nearly dusk:
  The mother-fox had led him a long chase--

  "Yes, and a fool's chase, too!" he seemed to say,
  And looked ashamed to hear us _praising_ him.
  But, _mother_--well, we _could not_ understand
  _Her_ acting as she did--and we so _pleased_!
  I can see yet the look of pained surprise
  And deep compassion of her troubled face
  When father very gently laid his coat,
  With the young foxes in it, on the hearth
  Beside her, as she brightened up the fire.
  She urged--for the old fox's sake and theirs--
  That they be taken back to the old tree;
  But father--for _our_ wistful sakes, no doubt--
  Said we would keep them, and would try our best
  To raise them. And at once he set about
  Building a snug home for the little things
  Out of an old big bushel-basket, with
  Its fractured handle and its stoven ribs:
  So, lining and padding this all cosily,
  He snuggled in its little tenants, and
  Called in John Wesley Thomas, our hired man,
  And gave him in full charge, with much advice
  Regarding the just care and sustenance of
  _Young_ foxes.--"John," he said, "you feed 'em _milk_--
  _Warm_ milk, John Wesley! Yes, and _keep 'em by_
  _The stove_--and keep your stove _a-roarin'_, too,
  Both night and day!--And keep 'em _covered_ up--
  Not _smothered_, John, but snug and comfortable.--

       *       *       *       *       *

[Illustration: "THE YOUNG FOXES IN IT, ON THE HEARTH BESIDE HER."]

       *       *       *       *       *

  And now, John Wesley Thomas, first and last,--
  You feed 'em _milk_--_fresh_ milk--and always _warm_--
  Say five or six or seven times a day--
  Of course we'll grade that by the way they _thrive_."
  But, for all sanguine hope, and care, as well,
  The little fellows _did not_ thrive at all.--
  Indeed, with _all_ our care and vigilance,
  By the third day of their captivity
  The last survivor of the fated five
  Squeaked, like some battered little rubber toy
  Just clean worn out.--And that's just what it was!

  And--nights,--the cry of the mother-fox for her young
  Was heard, with awe, for long weeks afterward.
  And we boys, every night, would go to the door
  And, peering out in the darkness, listening,
  Could hear the poor fox in the black bleak woods
  Still calling for her little ones in vain.
  As, all mutely, we returned to the warm fireside,
  Mother would say: "How would you like for _me_
  To be out there, this dark night, in the cold woods,
  Calling for _my_ children?"

  O here's a little rhyme for the Spring- or Summer-time--

  Just a little bit o' tune you can twitter, May or June,
    An a-ho-winky-tooden-an-a-ho!
  It's a song that soars and sings,
  As the birds that twang their wings
  Or the katydids and things
    Thus and so, don't you know,
    An a-ho-winky-tooden-an-a-ho!

  It's a song just broken loose, with no reason or excuse--
    An a-ho-winky-tooden-an-a-ho!
  You can sing along with it--or it matters not a bit--
    An a-ho-winky-tooden-an-a-ho!
  It's a lovely little thing
  That 'most any one could sing
  With a ringle-dingle-ding,
    Soft and low, don't you know,
    An a-ho-winky-tooden-an-a-ho!

  With a hey! and a hi! and a hey-ho rhyme!
      O the shepherd lad
      He is ne'er so glad
  As when he pipes, in the blossom-time,
      So rare!
  While Kate picks by, yet looks not there.
      So rare! so rare!
  _With a hey! and a hi! and a ho!_
  _The grasses curdle where the daisies blow!_

  With a hey! and a hi! and a hey-ho vow!
      Then he sips her face
      At the sweetest place--
  And ho! how white is the hawthorn now!--
      So rare!--
  And the daisied world rocks round them there.
      So rare! so rare!
  _With a hey! and a hi! and a ho!_
  _The grasses curdle where the daisies blow!_

TO THE CHILD JULIA

[R.H.]


  Little Julia, since that we
  May not as our elders be,
  Let us blithely fill the days
  Of our youth with pleasant plays.
  First we'll up at earliest dawn,
  While as yet the dew is on
  The sooth'd grasses and the pied
  Blossomings of morningtide;
  Next, with rinsed cheeks that shine
  As the enamell'd eglantine,
  We will break our fast on bread
  With both cream and honey spread;
  Then, with many a challenge-call,
  We will romp from house and hall,
  Gypsying with the birds and bees
  Of the green-tress'd garden trees.
  In a bower of leaf and vine
  Thou shalt be a lady fine
  Held in duress by the great
  Giant I shall personate.
  Next, when many mimics more
  Like to these we have played o'er,

[Illustration]

  We'll betake us home-along
  Hand in hand at evensong.

THE DOLLY'S MOTHER

[W.W.]


  A little maid, of summers four--
    Did you compute her years,--
  And yet how infinitely more
    To me her age appears:

  I mark the sweet child's serious air,
    At her unplayful play,--
  The tiny doll she mothers there
    And lulls to sleep away,

  Grows--'neath the grave similitude--
    An infant real, to me,
  And _she_ a saint of motherhood
    In hale maturity.

[Illustration]

  So, pausing in my lonely round,
    And all unseen of her,
  I stand uncovered--her profound
    And abject worshipper.

WIND OF THE SEA

[A.T.]


  Wind of the Sea, come fill my sail--
  Lend me the breath of a freshening gale
    And bear my port-worn ship away!
  For O the greed of the tedious town--
  The shutters up and the shutters down!
    Wind of the Sea, sweep over the bay
      And bear me away!--away!

  Whither you bear me, Wind of the Sea,
  Matters never the least to me:
    Give me your fogs, with the sails adrip,
  Or the weltering path thro' the starless night--
  On, somewhere, is a new daylight
    And the cheery glint of another ship
      As its colors dip and dip!

SUBTLETY

[R.B.]


  Whilst little Paul, convalescing, was staying
  Close indoors, and his boisterous classmates paying

[Illustration]

    Him visits, with fresh school-notes and surprises,--
  With nettling pride they sprung the word "Athletic,"
  With much advice and urgings sympathetic
    Anent "Athletic exercises." Wise as
  Lad might look, quoth Paul: "I've pondered o'er that
  'Athletic,' but I mean to take, before that,
    Downstairic and outdooric exercises."

BORN TO THE PURPLE

[W.M.]


  Most-like it was this kingly lad
  Spake out of the pure joy he had
  In his child-heart of the wee maid
  Whose eerie beauty sudden laid
  A spell upon him, and his words
  Burst as a song of any bird's:--

  A peerless Princess thou shalt be,
  Through wit of love's rare sorcery:
  To crown the crown of thy gold hair
  Thou shalt have rubies, bleeding there
  Their crimson splendor midst the marred
  Pulp of great pearls, and afterward

[Illustration]

  Leaking in fainter ruddy stains
  Adown thy neck-and-armlet-chains
  Of turquoise, chrysoprase, and mad
  Light-frenzied diamonds, dartling glad
  Swift spirts of shine that interfuse
  As though with lucent crystal dews
  That glance and glitter like split rays
  Of sunshine, born of burgeoning Mays
  When the first bee tilts down the lip
  Of the first blossom, and the drip
  Of blended dew and honey heaves
  Him blinded midst the underleaves.
  For raiment, Fays shall weave for thee--
  Out of the phosphor of the sea
  And the frayed floss of starlight, spun
  With counterwarp of the firm sun--
  A vesture of such filmy sheen
  As, through all ages, never queen
  Therewith strove truly to make less
  One fair line of her loveliness.
  Thus gowned and crowned with gems and gold,
  Thou shalt, through centuries untold,
  Rule, ever young and ever fair,
  As now thou rulest, smiling there.

  And they picked the locks of his palace-gate,
    The robbers that came to rob him--
  They picked the locks of his palace-gate,
  Seized his jewels and gems of state,
  His coffers of gold and his priceless plate,--
    The robbers that came to rob him.

  But loud laughed he in the morning red!--
    For of what had the robbers robbed him?--
  Ho! hidden safe, as he slept in bed,
    When the robbers came to rob him,--
  They robbed him not of a golden shred
  Of the childish dreams in his wise old head--
  "And they're welcome to all things else," he said,
    When the robbers came to rob him.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
