PREFACE

In his last letter to me Caldecott wrote: 'I have been making several
attempts at the Giant, and have been cogitating over the Illustrations
to "Jack" generally. During the winter I shall be able to show you some
of my ideas.' The following unfinished Sketches are the 'ideas,' which,
with Mrs. Caldecott's kind permission, have been reproduced.

To My Father,

In Recognition Of What This Booklet Owes To Him,

And To My Nephews,

'Golden-Hair'd' Ally, Charlie, And Michael,

Who Have So Far Condescended

As To Honour It With Their Approbation.




JACK AND THE BEAN-STALK


|JACK was a poor widow's heir, but he lived as a drone

```in a beehive,

`Hardly a handstir a day did he work. To squander her

```earnings

`Seem'd to the poor widow hard, who raved and scolded

```him always.

`Nought in her house was left; not a cheese, not a loaf,

```not an onion;

`Nought but a cow in her yard, and that must go to the

```market.

`"Sell me the cow," cried she; then he sold it, gad! for a

```handful----

`Only to think!------of beans. She shied them out thro'

```the window,

`Cursing him: hied to her bed, there slept, but awoke in

```amazement,

`Seeing a huge bean-stalk, many leaves, many pods, many

```flowers,

`Rise to the clouds more tall than a tall California  pine-

```tree;

`High as a lark was Jack, scarce seen, and climbing away

```there.

`"Where an' O where," * he shrill'd; she beheld his boots

```disappearing;

* "<i>Where an' O where is my Highland laddie gone?</i>"


`Pod by pod Jack arose, till he came to a pod that alarm'd

```him.

`Bridge-like this long pod stretch'd out, and touch'd on an

```island

`Veil'd in vapour. A shape from the island waved him a

```signal,

`Waved with a shining hand, and Jack with an humble

```obeisance

`Crawl'd to the shape, who remark'd, "I gave those beans

```to ye, darling.

`I am a fairy, a friend to ye, Jack; see yonder a Giant

`Lives, who slew your own good father, see what a fortress!

`Enter it, have no fear, since I, your fairy, protect you."

`Jack march'd up to the gate, in a moment pass'd to the

```kitchen

`Led by the savoury smell. This Giant's wife with a ladle

`Basted a young elephant (Jack's namesake shriek'd and

```turn'd it).

`Back Jack shrank in alarm: with fat cheeks peony-bulbous,

`Ladle in hand, she stood, and spake in a tone of amuse-

```ment: .

`"Oh! what a cramp'd-up, small, unsesquipedalian object!"

`Then from afar came steps, heavy tramps, as a pavior

```hamm'ring;

`Out of her huge moon-cheeks the redundant peony faded,

`Jack's lank hair she grabb'd, and, looking sad resolution,

`Popt him aghast in among her saucepans' grimy recesses.

`Then strode in, with a loud heavy-booted thunder of heel-

```taps,

`He with a tiger at heel--her Giant, swarthy, colossal:

`"I smell flesh of a man; yea, wife, tho' he prove but a

```morsel,

`Man tastes good." She replied, "Sure thou be'est failing

```in eyesight;

`'Tis but a young elephant, my sweetest lord, not a biped."

`Down he crook'd his monstrous knees, and rested his hip-

```bones,

`Call'd for his hen, said "Lay so she, with a chuck cock-

```a-doodle,

`Dropt him an egg, pure gold, a refulgent, luminous

```oval,--

`That was her use:--when he push'd her aside, cried,

```"Bring me the meat now,"

`Gorged his enormous meal, fell prone, and lost recollection.

`Jack from a saucepan watch'd his broad chest's monstrous

```upheavals:

`Then to the chamber above both dame and tiger ascended.

`"Now for it, hist!" says Jack--"coast clear, and none to

```behold me,"

`Airily Jack stole forth, and seized the plump, money-

```laying,

`Priceless, mystical hen; ran forth, sped away to the bean-

```stalk,

`Heard from afar, then near, heavy tramps, as a pavior

```hamm'ring,

`Sprang down pod by pod, with a bounding, grasshopper

```action,

`Left the Colossus aghast at an edge of his own little

```island,

`Lighted on earth, whom she, that bare him, fondly

```saluting,

`Dropt a maternal tear, and dried that tear with her

```apron,

`Seeing him home and safe; and after it, all was a hey-day,

`Lots of loaves, and tons of cheeses, a barnful of onions;

`Cows and calves, and creams, and gold eggs piled to the

```ceilings:

`Horses, goats, and geese, and pigs, and pugs by the

```hundred.

`Ah! but he found in a while his life of laziness irk-

```some.

`"Climb me," the bean-stalk said with a whisper. Jack,

```reascending,

`Swarm'd to the wonderful isle once more, and high

```habitation;

`Led by the fairy return'd to the fortress, pass'd to the

```kitchen,

`Unseen, hied him again to the saucepans' grimy recesses,

`Peep'd out into the room. The plump wife, peony-

```bulbous,

`Toasted a constrictor, which roll'd in vast revolutions.

`Then strode in, strong-booted again, with a roar, the

```Colossus:

`Call'd for his harp, said "Play." So this, with a sharp

```treble ting-tong,

`Play'd him an air, a delightful, long-drawn, national

```anthem,

`Play'd him an air, untouch'd, (the strings, by a fairy

```magician

`Wrought, were alive). Then he shouted aloud, "Wife,

```bring me the meat now,"

`Gorged his elongate meal; the snake in warm revolutions,

`Making his huge bulk swell, disappear'd like Man's

```macaroni:

`After, he yawn'd and snored, fell prone, and lost recol-

```lection.

`So Jack seized the melodious harp, and bolted. A

```murmur

`"Master, master, a rascal, a rascal!" rang thro' the harp-

```strings.

`Quickly the monster awoke, and wielding a cudgel,--

```an oak tree,--

`Chased little Jack with a shout of mighty, maniacal

```anger;

`Jack to the beanpod sprang with a leap, and desperate

```hurl'd his

`Limbs in a downward, furious, headlong pre-cipitation,

`But for a wink up-glanced; his foeman's ponderous

```hob-nails

`Shone from aloft: down crash'd big pods, and bean

```avalanches.

`"Haste mother, haste mother, oh! mother, haste, and

```bring me the hatchet!"

`Cried Jack, alighting on earth. She brought him an

```axe double-handed.

`Jack cleft clean thro' the haulm; that Giant desperate

```hurl'd his.

`Limbs in a downward, roaring, thund'ring pre-cipitation,

`Crash'd to the ground stone-dead with a crash as a crag

```from a mountain.

`"I'm your master now," said Jack to the harp at his

```elbow;

`"There's your old 'un! of him pray give your candid

```opinion!"

`Sweetly the mystical harp responded, "Master, a rascal!"

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
