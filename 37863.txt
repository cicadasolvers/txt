Operation

Breaking-in Instructions

Keep Radiator Full                             Keep Oil Reservoir Full


Heat is a major consideration in a new engine. Do not allow the engine
to overheat. Although the heat indicator on the instrument panel shows
the general temperature of the engine, it will not show a sudden rise
in temperature of an individual part.

The pressure imposed on parts such as bearings and pistons due to rapid
acceleration or hard pulling will cause them to overheat if the car has
not been driven sufficiently to break them in. Avoid fast acceleration
and hard pulling while breaking in.

High speed also develops higher operating temperatures and to avoid
damage the car speed should be kept within the following
recommendations:

0-250 MILES

     Do not exceed 40 miles per hour in high gear or 20 miles per
     hour in second. Do not accelerate rapidly. Use second gear
     on steep grades. Keep motor temperature within "driving
     range" on dash heat indicator.

250-500 MILES

     Do not exceed 50 miles per hour in high gear or 25 miles per
     hour in second.

500-1000 MILES

     During this period the speed should not exceed 60 miles per
     hour.


IMPORTANT

Do not UNDER ANY CONSIDERATION attempt to maintain a high rate of speed
unless the crankcase is full of good oil and until the engine is
thoroughly warmed up. Cold oil is not able to flow freely into the
small clearances between working parts so that damage may occur if
sufficient time is not allowed for warming up before attempting high
speeds.




[Illustration: OIL SIGNAL, CLUTCH CONTROL, GENERATOR SIGNAL,
STARTER, LIGHTS, IGNITION, CHOKE]

Starting the Engine


If the engine is cold, pull the choke knob out as far as possible, turn
the ignition switch key to the right, depress the accelerator pedal
slightly, and pull the starter knob out. When the engine "fires," push
the choke knob in until the engine runs evenly. Return the choke knob
gradually to the full in position as the engine warms up. The choke
knob should never be out any farther than necessary to maintain even
running of the engine.

If the engine is warm from previous running, use the choke sparingly.
In most instances the engine will start immediately without the use of
the choke if the accelerator pedal is held in a slightly depressed
position while the starter is used. Do not under any circumstances work
the accelerator pedal rapidly when starting as the accelerator pump may
flood the carburetor.

=Oil Signal=--The red signal on the left hand indicates oil pressure
and the functioning of the oiling system. It will glow when the
ignition switch is turned on but will go out when the car is under way.
Should it continue to burn or flash while the car is under way, it
indicates that the oil supply is low or that the oiling system is not
functioning properly. Do not run the engine until the oil supply has
been replenished or trouble corrected.

=Generator Signal=--The red signal on the right hand will light when
the ignition switch is turned on and will be lighted at all times
unless the engine is running at higher than idling speed. Should this
signal glow at normal running speeds, it indicates that the generator
is not charging and should be inspected immediately by an Essex
dealer.




Lubrication


Engine

Use High-Grade Oil--Medium Heavy Body (S.A.E. 30)

[Illustration]

If cold weather prevails, be sure the oil you use will flow at the
temperatures encountered. Oil supply should be maintained at the full
mark on the bayonet gauge at the oil filler.

The frequency with which oil should be drained and replenished with new
depends largely on the operation of the car. Consult your dealer for
recommendations on your car. In any event the oil should be changed at
least every 2500 miles.


Clutch

[Illustration]

Use only a mixture composed of 1/2 kerosene and 1/2 engine oil. Turn
starter shaft with wrench, moving wrench handle toward the engine until
plug "A" is accessible through opening in rear engine plate. Remove
plug "A," continue turning flywheel until opening is down and all
clutch oil is drained. Then turn until opening is again accessible.
Pour in by means of offset funnel no more than 1/3 pint of clutch
mixture. Replace plug "A" and tighten securely. The clutch oil should
be drained and replenished at least every 5000 miles.

The clutch throwout bearing should be lubricated with one ounce of
light viscous grease[A] every 500 miles. A pressure fitting is provided
on the right side of the clutch bell housing.

[Footnote A: _See page 7 for grease specifications._]


Transmission

[Illustration]

The transmission lubricant should be maintained to the level of the
filler plug "A." In warm climate or during summer months use
transmission gear oil S.A.E. 110. In winter or when near-zero
temperatures prevail use transmission gear oil S.A.E. 80. Remove drain
plug "B" every 5000 miles, flush out with 1 pint of kerosene and refill
with oil of proper type.


Rear Axle

[Illustration]

The oil supply should be kept level with the lower edge of the filler
plug opening "A." Use a good grade of heavy-bodied gear oil. S.A.E. 110
in warm climate (summer temperatures)--S.A.E. 90 when lower
temperatures prevail (winter). During the winter months be sure the oil
you are using will flow at the temperatures encountered.


Wheel Bearings

[Illustration]

The front wheel bearings should be lubricated every 5000 miles with a
good grade of cup grease. Remove hub and wash bearings and inside of
hub with kerosene. Pack each bearing and hub with 3 ounces of No. 2 cup
grease (see page 12 for adjusting wheel bearings).

The rear wheel bearings should be lubricated every 5000 miles with No.
3 cup grease. Remove four nuts from bearing cap "A" and remove caps and
shims. Pull bearing and after washing bearing and housing in kerosene
repack each bearing housing with 1-1/2 ounces of cup grease. Then
replace bearings, shims and caps, draw up wheel hub tight on shaft and
install cotter pin.


Steering Gear

Summer S.A.E. 160
Winter S.A.E. 110

[Illustration]

Remove plug "A" and pour a good heavy-bodied gear oil into the steering
gear housing every 2000 miles. Do not use cup grease or you will
experience hard steering in cold weather.


Chassis

[Illustration]

All spring shackle fittings (12) should be lubricated every 1000 miles
with a light viscous grease.[B]

All pressure fittings on the front axle (4) and the steering gear drag
link (2) should be lubricated every 1000 miles with pressure grease.

The front universal joint sleeve splines should be supplied with a
small amount of long fibre grease, through the plug provided, at
4000-mile intervals.

[Footnote B: _Grease Specifications--4% Calcium Soap compounded with an
oil of 400 seconds viscosity and a zero pour test._]


Generator

[Illustration]

Supply three or four drops (no more) of engine oil to each oil cup "A"
and "B" every 1000 miles. Do not attempt to supply more oil as it may
interfere with the functioning of the generator.


Distributor

[Illustration]

Fill distributor base with oil at cup "C" every 2000 miles. Coat rotor
cam "A" with a thin film of vaseline every 2000 miles. Apply one drop
(no more) of light oil to breaker arm pivot "B" every 2000 miles. Wipe
excess oil and clean distributor head, removing oil or dust before
returning to position. Be sure each high-tension terminal and wire on
distributor head is pushed as far into its socket as it will go.


Fan

[Illustration]

Fill fan shaft bearing with engine oil at oil cup "A" every 1000 miles.
It is very important that the fan shaft has plenty of lubrication at
all times.


Miscellaneous

=Throttle Control Rod=--Oil or grease all accelerator connections.
Throttle linkage should work with a snap. Grease choke wire
occasionally to eliminate sticking.

=Door Locks=--Apply a drop of engine oil occasionally to latch bar.
Work several times to spread oil, then wipe off excess.

=Door Latch Striker Plate=--Saturate wick with motor oil.

=Door Dovetails=--Saturate wick in male member with motor oil.

=Door Hinges=--Open doors and drop light oil in each hinge oil hole,
located under the top ledge of body portion of hinge. Wipe off excess.

=Hood Locks=--Lubricate occasionally with motor oil.




Adjustment


Engine Tuning

[Illustration]

Do not attempt to adjust the carburetor alone. Perform all of the
following operations in the order given:

     1. Clean spark plugs and adjust gaps to .025" (.62 mm.).

     2. Clean distributor breaker points and adjust to .020"
        (.50 mm.) maximum opening as described under Ignition
        Timing.

     3. Check battery and ignition wiring, being sure _all
        distributor wires are pressed down in their sockets_.

     4. Set ignition timing as described under Ignition Timing.

     5. Adjust intake valve tappet clearance to .006" (.15 mm.)
        and exhaust tappet clearance to .008" (.20 mm.).

     6. Turn carburetor idling screw "B" into its seat and back
        out exactly one turn.

     7. Start engine.

     8. Set carburetor throttle stop screw "A" so that engine
        idles at a speed equal to a car speed of 5 m.p.h. in high
        gear.

     9. Adjust carburetor idling screw "B" for smooth engine
        idling. The final adjustment should be from 1/2 to 1 turn
        of the screw from its full in position.

If the above operations, properly performed, do not give normal engine
performance, the car should be taken to an Essex dealer for mechanical
inspection.


Ignition Timing

[Illustration]

Remove distributor cap and inspect points. High points can be removed
by placing a breaker point file between points and letting them close
against file under their normal spring pressure. Move file straight up
and down, dressing both points at the same time. If the points are
pitted, they should be ground or replaced.

Crank engine, using wrench on starter shaft extension, until the
breaker arm fibre block is on the highest point of the cam, giving the
points their maximum opening. If necessary to adjust, loosen lock nut
"D" and turn screw "E" until the gap is .020" (.50 mm.). Tighten lock
nut.

Remove the spark plug from number one cylinder. Crank the engine slowly
by hand until air is forced out through the spark plug hole. Continue
turning the engine slowly until the D.C. 1 and 6 mark is exactly in
line with the pointer as shown at "A."

[Illustration]

Loosen distributor clamp screw "B" and turn distributor clockwise to
the full limit permitted by the slot in the clamping plate "C."

Turn the distributor counterclockwise until the points have just begun
to open. Tighten lock screw "B."

When the engine is in this position the rotor arm "F" will point
directly to the sector in the distributor cap to which number one spark
plug cable is connected. Following around the cap clockwise from this
point the spark plug wires should be in the following order:
1-5-3-6-2-4.


Fan and Generator Belt

[Illustration]

The fan and generator drive belt must be kept at sufficient tension to
prevent slippage on the pulleys. Do not adjust too tightly or rapid
wear on fan and generator bearings will result. To adjust belt tension,
loosen nut "A" and swing generator away from engine to tighten. Then
lock adjustment by thoroughly tightening nut "A."


Clutch Pedal

[Illustration]

The clutch rod length should be adjusted so that the clutch pedal can
be pushed down 1-1/2" before the clearance is taken up between the
levers on the clutch cross shaft and the clutch throwout yoke shaft and
further movement of the clutch pedal will begin to disengage the
clutch.

To adjust: Loosen lock nut "A," remove clevis pin "C" and turn yoke "B"
to obtain proper length. Insert clevis pin and tighten lock nut "A."


Brakes

[Illustration]

Unless you are an experienced mechanic, it is advisable to have your
brakes adjusted by your Essex dealer. The following operation will,
however, take care of normal brake shoe wear if done carefully:

Jack up car, remove all four wheels and remove the inspection covers
from the front of the brake drums. Disconnect the four brake cables
from the cross shaft; turn the brake drum until the inspection hole is
1-1/2" from the adjusting screw end of the lining of the upper shoe
(rear of front brakes--front of rear brakes).

Insert a .014" (.35 mm.) feeler through the inspection hole. Loosen
eccentric lock nut "A" and turn eccentric "B" in the direction the
wheel rotates when the car is moving forward until the feeler is held
snugly between the drum and the lining. Hold the eccentric in this
position and tighten lock nut "A." Make this adjustment on all four
brakes.

Turn brake drum until inspection hole is 1-1/2" from adjusting screw
end of the lining of the lower shoe (rear of front brakes--front of
rear brakes). Insert a .008" (.15 mm.) feeler through inspection hole.
Insert a screwdriver through opening "C" and turn star wheel until
feeler is held snugly. Move the handle of the screwdriver toward the
axle to tighten brakes. Make this adjustment on all four wheels.

Reconnect the brake cables at the cross shaft, adjusting the position
of the cable yoke so that the clevis pin can just be inserted in the
yoke and cross shaft lever hole when the cable is held just taut enough
to remove slack.

If trial on road shows too much braking on one wheel, loosen that brake
by turning star wheel with screwdriver one notch at a time until the
brake is equal with the others. Always loosen the tight brake--do not
tighten the loose brakes or the pedal travel will be restricted and may
cause brake drag.


Front Wheel Bearings

[Illustration]

After jacking up front axle and removing the hub cap, withdraw cotter
key holding nut "A." Turn nut "A" to the right until a slight drag is
felt when turning the wheel slightly by hand. Then loosen the nut just
sufficiently to permit the wheel to turn freely. Insert cotter key.


Rear Wheel Bearings

[Illustration]

To adjust rear wheel bearings, jack up rear axle and remove both rear
wheels. Remove the four nuts from bearing cap "A" and remove cap. By
removing shims "B" under the cap the end play of the axle shaft is
decreased. Total play between axle shafts should be from .005" to .010"
(.12 to .25 mm.) which is perceptible by pulling shaft in and out with
the hand. It is necessary that the thickness of shims at each rear
wheel be approximately the same, so when adjusting remove a thin shim
from each side and repeat, if necessary, until only a slight amount of
play is evident. Be sure the axle shafts turn freely before building
up.


Removing and Installing Wheels

To remove a wheel, place a screwdriver between the hub cap and hub and
pry off cap. Loosen the four cap screws "B" (illustration top of page)
with the socket wrench provided. Remove one cap screw in the lowest
position and insert the handle of the wrench through the screw hole
into the hub. While holding the wheel in position with the wrench,
remove the other cap screws and lift off the wheel. The wheels should
be jacked up just sufficiently to clear the ground. When replacing the
wheel, place the handle of the wrench through the lower cap screw hole,
lift up on the wrench so that the wheel will clear the ground and push
in place. Align by moving wrench back and forth. Then start two of the
cap screws, remove the wrench and start the remaining two. Tighten
every other cap screw until all are down enough to hold wheel in place,
making sure it is square on the hub. Continue tightening every other
screw until all are secure.

coating is recommended, providing the lacquer is thoroughly cleaned and
prepared for the wax surface.

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

Gutenberg-tm License.

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
