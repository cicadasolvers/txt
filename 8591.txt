PREFACE.


This book is intended as an introduction to the reading and study of
French lyric poetry. If it contributes toward making that poetry more
widely known and more justly appreciated its purpose will have been
fulfilled.

It is rather usual among English-speaking people to think slightingly
of the poetry of France, especially of her lyrics. This is not
unnatural. The qualities that give French verse its distinction are
very different from those that make the strength and the charm of our
English lyrics. But we must guard ourselves against the conclusion
that because a work is unlike those that we are accustomed to admire
it is necessarily bad. There are many kinds of excellence. And this
little book must have been poorly put together indeed if it fail to
suggest to the reader that France possesses a wealth of lyric
verse which, whatever be its shortcomings in those qualities that
characterize our English lyrics, has others quite its own, both of
form and of spirit, that give it a high and serious interest and no
small measure of beauty and charm.

The editor has sought to keep the purpose of the volume constantly in
view in preparing the introduction and notes. He has hoped to supply
such information as would be most helpful, if not indispensable, to
the reader. And as he has thought that the best service the book could
render would be to stimulate interest in French poetry and to persuade
to a wider reading of it, he has wished in the bibliography to meet
especially the wants of those who may be inclined to pursue further
one or another of the acquaintances here begun. It is of course not
intended to be in any wise exhaustive, but only to present the sum of
an author's lyrical work, to indicate current and available editions,
and to point out sources of further information; among these last it
has sometimes been accessibility to the American reader rather than
relative importance that has dictated the insertion of a title.

The editor acknowledges here his wholesale indebtedness for his
materials to the various sources that he has recommended to the
reader. But he wishes to confess the special debt that he owes to Miss
Eugenie Galloo, Assistant Professor of French in the University of
Kansas, for many suggestions and valuable help with the proofs.
Her assistance has reduced considerably the number of the volume's
imperfections. For those that remain he can hold no one responsible
but himself.

INTRODUCTION.


As literature is not a bundle of separate threads, but one fabric, it
is manifestly impossible to give an adequate account of any one of its
forms, as the lyric poem, by itself and aside from the larger web of
which it is a part. The following pages will attempt only to sketch
the main phases which the history of the lyric in France exhibits and
so to furnish a rough outline that may help the reader of these poems
to place them in the right historical relations. He should fill it out
at all points by study of some history of French literature.[1] No
account will be taken here of those kinds of verse that have only a
slight contact with serious poetry. Such are, for instance, the songs
of the _chansonniers_, mainly of vinous inspiration, which followed a
tradition of their own apart from that of the more sober lyric, though
some of the later writers, especially BERANGER and DUPONT, raised them
to a higher dignity. Such also are the songs so abundant in the modern
vaudevilles and light operas, many of which have enjoyed a very wide
circulation and great favor and have left couplets fixed in the memory
of the great public.

Neither will account be taken of the poems of oral tradition, the
_chansons populaires_, of which France possesses a rich treasure, but
which have never there, as so conspicuously in Germany, been brought
into fructifying contact with the literary lyric.[2]

The beginnings of the literary tradition of lyric poetry in France are
found in the poetry of the Troubadours. No doubt lyric expression was
no new discovery then; lyrics in the popular language had existed from
time immemorial. But it was in the twelfth century and in Provence
that it began to be cultivated by a considerable number of persons who
consciously treated it as an art and developed for it rules and forms.
These were the Troubadours. Though their poems did not, at least at
first, lack sincerity and spontaneity, their tendency to theorizing
about the ideals of courtly life, especially about the nature and
practice of love as the ideal form of refined conduct, was not
favorable to these qualities. As lyrical expression lost in directness
and spontaneity it was natural that more and more attention should
be paid to form. The external qualities of verse were industriously
cultivated. Great ingenuity was expended upon the invention of
intricate and elaborate forms. Beginning at the end of the eleventh
century, the poetry of the Troubadours had by the middle of the
twelfth become a highly artificial and studied product. It was then
that it began to awaken imitation in the north of France and thus
determine the beginnings of French lyric poetry.

An earlier native lyric had indeed existed in northern France, known
to us only by scanty fragments and allusions. It was a simple and
light accompaniment of dancing or of the monotonous household tasks
of sewing and spinning. Its theme was love and love-making. Its
characteristic outward feature was a recurring refrain. The manner and
frequency of repeating this refrain determined different forms, as
_rondets_, _ballettes_, and _virelis_ But there are few examples left
us of early French lyrics that have not already felt the influence
of the art of the Troubadours. Even those that are in a way the most
perfect and distinctive products of the earlier period, the fresh
and graceful _pastourelles_, with their constant theme of a pretty
shepherdess wooed by a knight, may have been imported from the south
and have pretty surely been touched by southern influence.

From the middle of the twelfth century the native lyric in the
north was entirely submerged under the flood of imitations of the
Troubadours. The marriage of Eleanor of Poitiers with Louis VII. in
1137 brought Provence and France together, and opened the north,
particularly about her court and that of her daughter Marie, Countess
of Champagne, at Troyes, to the ideas and manners of the south. The
first result was an eager and widespread imitation of the Provencal
models. Among these earliest cultivators of literary art in the French
language the most noteworthy were CONON DE BETHUNE (d. 1224), BLONDEL
DE NESLE, GACE BRULE, GUI DE COUCI (d. 1201), GAUTIER D'ESPINAUS, and
THIBAUT DE CHAMPAGNE, King of Navarre (d. 1253). There is in the work
of these poets a great sameness. Their one theme was love as the
essential principle of perfect courtly conduct, and their treatment
was made still more lifeless by the use of allegory which was
beginning to reveal its fascination for the mediaeval mind. From all
their work the note of individuality is almost completely absent.
Their art consisted in saying the same conventional commonplaces in
a form that was not just like any other previously devised. So the
predominance of the formal element was a matter of necessity. Some
variation from existing forms was the one thing required of a piece of
verse.

This school of direct imitation flourished for about a century. Then
it suddenly ceased and for another century there was almost no lyric
production of any sort. In the fourteenth century Guillaume de
Machault (1295- 1377) inaugurated a revival, hardly of lyric poetry,
but of the cultivation of lyric forms. He introduced a new style which
made the old conventional themes again presentable by refinement of
phrase and rhetorical embellishments, and he directed the pursuit
of form not to the invention of ever new variations, but to the
perfection of a few forms. And it is noticeable that these fixed forms
were not selected from those elaborated under Provencal influence, but
were the developments of the forms of the earlier _chansons a danser_,
the _rondets_, _ballettes_, and _virelis_. The new poetic art that
proceeded from Machault spent itself mainly in refining the phrase of
the old commonplaces, allegories, and reflections, and on turning them
out in _rondels_, _rondeaux_, _triolets_, _ballades_, _chants royaux_,
and _virelis_. The new fashion was followed by FROISSART (1337-1410),
EUSTACHE DESCHAMPS (approximately 1340-1407), who rhymed one thousand
four hundred and forty ballades, CHRISTINE DE PISAN (1363-_?_), and
CHARLES D'ORLEANS (1391-1465), who marks the culmination of the
movement by the perfection of formal elegance and easy grace which his
rondels and ballades exhibit.

All this lyric poetry had been the product of an aristocratic and
polite society. But there existed at the same time in the north of
France a current of lyrical production in an entirely different social
region. The bourgeoisie, at least in the larger and industrial towns,
followed the example of the princely courts, and vied with them in
cultivating a formal lyric, and numerous societies, called _puis_,
arranged poetical competitions and offered prizes. Naturally in their
hands the courtly lyric only degenerated. But there were now and then
men of greater individuality who, if their verses lacked something
of the refinement and elaborateness of the courtly lyric, more than
atoned for it by the greater directness and sincerity of their
utterance, and by their closer contact with common life and real
experience. Here belong the farewell poems (_conges_) of JEAN BODEL
(twelfth century) and ADAM DE LA HALLE (about 1235-1285), of Arras;
here belong especially two Parisians who were real poets, RUTEBEUF
(d. about 1280) and FRANCOIS VILLON (1431- 146?), who distinctly
announces the end of the old order of things and the beginning of
modern times, not by any renewal of the fixed forms, within which he
continued to move, but by cutting loose from the conventional round
of subjects and ideas, and by giving a strikingly direct and personal
expression to thoughts and feelings that he had the originality to
think and feel for himself.

But no one at once appeared to make VILLON'S example fruitful for
the development of lyric verse, and it went on its way of formal
refinement at the hands of the industrious school of rhetoricians,
becoming more and more dry and empty, more and more a matter of
intricate mechanism and ornament. No more signal proof of the
sterility of the school could be imagined than the triumphs of the art
of some of the grands _rhetoriqueurs_ like MESCHINOT (1415?-1491),
or MOLINET (d. 1507), the recognized leader of his day. The last
expiring effort of this essentially mediaeval lyric is seen in CLEMENT
MAROT. He had already begun to catch the glow of the dawn of the
Renaissance, but he was rooted in the soil of the middle ages and
his real masters were his immediate predecessors. He avoided their
absurdities of alliteration and redundant rhyme and their pedantry;
but he appropriated the results of their efforts at perfecting the
verse structure and adhered to the traditional forms. The great stores
of the ancient literatures that were thrown open to France in the
course of the first half of the sixteenth century came too late to be
the main substance of MAROT'S culture.

But it was far otherwise with the next generation. It was nurtured on
the literatures of Greece, Rome, and Italy, which was also a classical
land for the France of that day; and it was almost beside itself with
enthusiasm for them. The traditions of the mediaeval lyric and all its
fixed forms were swept away with one breath as barbarous rubbish by
the proclamations of the young admirers of antiquity. The manifesto of
the new movement, the _Defense et Illustration de la langue francaise_
by JOACHIM DU BELLAY, bade the poet "leave to the Floral Games of
Toulouse and to the _puis_ of Rouen all those old French verses, such
as _Rondeaux_, _Ballades_, _Virelais_, _Chants royaux_, _Chansons_,
and other like vulgar trifles," and apply himself to rivaling the
ancients in epigrams, elegies, odes, satires, epistles, eclogues, and
the Italians in sonnets. But the transformation which this movement
effected for the lyric did not come from the substitution of different
forms as models. It had a deeper source.

Acquaintance with the ancients and the attendant great movement of
ideas of the Renaissance reopened the true springs of lyric poetry.
The old moulds of thought and feeling were broken. The human
individual had a new, more direct and more personal view of nature and
of life. That note of direct personal experience, almost of individual
sensation, that was possible to a VILLON only by virtue of a very
strong temperament and of a very exceptional social position, became
the privilege of a whole generation by reason of the new aspect in
which the world appeared. The Renaissance transformed indeed the whole
of French literature, but the first branch to blossom at its breath
was the lyric. Of the famous seven, RONSARD, DU BELLAY, BAIF, BELLEAU,
PONTUS DE THYARD, JODELLE, and DAURAT, self-styled the _Pleiade_,
who were the champions of classical letters, all except JODELLE were
principally lyric poets, and RONSARD and DU BELLAY have a real claim
to greatness. This new lyric strove consciously to be different from
the older one. Instead of _ballades_ and _rondeaux_, it produced odes,
elegies, sonnets, and satires. It condemned the common language and
familiar style of VILLON and MAROT as vulgar, and sought nobility,
elevation, and distinction. To this end it renewed its vocabulary by
wholesale borrowing and adaptation from the Latin, much enriching the
language, though giving color to the charge of Boileau that RONSARD'S
muse "_en francais parlait grec et latin_".

Of this constellation of poets RONSARD was the bright particular star.
The others hailed him as master, and he enjoyed for the time an almost
unexampled fame. To him were addressed the well known lines attributed
to Charles IX.:

    Tous deux egalement nous portons des couronnes:
    Mais, roi, je la recus: poete, tu la donnes.

His example must be reckoned high for his younger contemporaries
beside the ancient writers to whom he pointed them.

But his authority was of short duration. REGNIER and D'AUBIGNE, who
lived into the seventeenth century, could still be counted of his
school. But they had already fallen upon times which began to be
dissatisfied with the work of RONSARD and his disciples, to find
their language crude and undigested, their grammar disordered,
their expression too exuberant, lacking in dignity, sobriety, and
reasonableness. There was a growing disposition to exalt the claims of
regularity, order, and a recognized standard. A strict censorship was
exercised over an author's vocabulary, grammar, and versification.
Individual freedom was brought under the curb of rule. The man who
voiced especially this growing temper of the times was MALHERBE
(1555-1628). No doubt his service was great to French letters as a
whole, since the movement that he stood for prepared those qualities
which give French literature of the classic period its distinction.
But these qualities are those of a highly objective and impersonal
expression, seeking perfection in conformity to the general consensus
of reasonable and intelligent minds, not of an intensely subjective
expression, concerned in the first place with being true to the
promptings of an individual temperament; and lyric expression is
essentially of the latter kind. MALHERBE, therefore, in repressing the
liberty of the individual temperament, sealed the springs of lyric
poetry, which the Renaissance had opened, and they were not again set
running till a new emancipation of the individual had come with the
Revolution. Between MALHERBE and CHATEAUBRIAND, that is for almost
two hundred years, poetry that breathes the true lyric spirit is
practically absent from French literature. There were indeed the
_chansonniers_, who produced a good deal of bacchanalian verse, but
they hardly ever struck a serious note. Almost the most genuinely
lyric productions of this long period are those which proceed more
or less directly from a reading of Hebrew poetry, like the numerous
paraphrases of the Psalms or the choruses of RACINE'S biblical plays.
The typical lyric product of the time was the ode, trite, pompous, and
frigid. Even ANDRE CHENIER, who came on the eve of the Revolution
and freed himself largely from the narrow restraint of the literary
tradition by imbibing directly the spirit of the Greek poets, hardly
yielded to a real lyric impulse till he felt the shadow of the
guillotine. It is significant of the difficulty that the whole
poetical theory put in the way of the lyric that perhaps the most
intensely lyrical temperament of these two hundred years, JEAN JACQUES
ROUSSEAU, did not write in verse at all.

That which again unsealed the lyric fountains was Romanticism.
Whatever else this much discussed but ill defined word
involves--sympathy with the middle ages, new perception of the world
of nature, interest in the foreign and the unusual--it certainly
suggests a radically new estimate of the importance and of the
authority of the individual. It was to the profit of the individual
that the old social and political forms had been broken up and
melted in the Revolution. It could seem for a moment as if, with the
proclamation of the freedom and independence of the individual, all
the barriers were down that hemmed in his free motion, as if there
were no limits to his self-assertion. His separate personal life got a
new amplitude, its possibilities expanded infinitely, and its interest
was vastly increased. The whole new world of ideas and impulses urged
the individual to pursue and to express his own personal experience of
the world. CHATEAUBRIAND made the great revelation of the change that
had taken place, and in spite of the fact that his instrument is
prose, the lyric quality of many a passage of Rene was as unmistakable
as it was new. But the lyric impulse could not at once shake off
literary tradition. It needed to learn a new language, one more
direct and personal, one less stiff with the starch of propriety and
elegance. The more spontaneous and genuine it became, the closer
it approached this language. DELAVIGNE won great applause by his
_Messeniennes_ (1815-19), but the lyric impulse was not strong enough
in him to make him independent of the traditional rhetoric. MME.
DESBORDES-VALMORE, less influenced by literary training and more
mastered by the emotion that prompted her, found the real lyric note.
But it was especially LAMARTINE whose poetic utterance was most
spontaneous and who recovered for France the gift of lyric expression.
His _Meditations poetiques_ (1820) were greeted with extraordinary
enthusiasm and marked the dawn of a new era in French poetry.

But other influences making for a poetic revival were multiplied.
A very important one was the spreading knowledge of other modern
literatures, particularly those of England and Germany with their
lyric treasures. Presently there began to be a union of efforts for
a literary reform, as in the Renaissance, and the Romantic movement
began to be defined. Its watchword was freedom in art, and as a reform
it was naturally considerably determined by the classicism against
which it rebelled. The qualities that it strove to possess were
sharply in contrast with those that had distinguished French poetry
for two hundred years, if they were not in direct opposition to them:
in its matter, breadth and infinite variety took the place of a narrow
and sterile nobility--"everything that is in nature is in art"; in its
language, directness, strength, vigor, freshness, color, brilliancy,
picturesqueness, replaced cold propriety, conventional elegance and
trite periphrasis; in its form, melody, variety of rhythm, richness
and sonority of rhyme, diversity of stanza structure and flexibility
of line were sought and achieved, sometimes at the expense of the
old rules. By 1830 the young poets, who were now fairly swarming,
exhibited the general romantic coloring very clearly. Almost from the
first VICTOR HUGO had been their leader. His earliest volume indeed
contained little promise of a literary revolution. But the volume of
_Orientales_ (1828) was more than a promise; it held a large measure
of fulfilment, and is a landmark in the history of French poetry. The
technical qualities of these lyrics were a revelation. They distinctly
enlarged the capacity of the language for lyrical expression.

There are three other great lyric poets in the generation of 1830: DE
VIGNY, DE MUSSET, and GAUTIER. De Vigny annexed to the domain of lyric
poetry the province of intellectual passion and a more impersonal and
reflecting emotion. De Musset gave to the lyric the most intense and
direct accent of personal feeling and made his muse the faithful and
responsive echo of his heart. Gautier was an artist in words and laid
especial stress on the perfection of form (cf. _l'Art_, p. 190); and
it was he especially that the younger poets followed.

By the middle of the century the main springs of Romanticism began to
show symptoms of exhaustion. The subjective and personal character of
its lyric verse provoked protest. It seemed to have no other theme but
self, to be a universal confession or self-glorification, immodest and
egotistical. And it began to be increasingly out of harmony with the
intellectual temper, which was determined more and more by positive
philosophy and the scientific spirit. LECONTE DE LISLE voiced this
protest most clearly (cf. _les Montreurs_, p. 199), and set forth the
claims of an art that should find its whole aim in the achievement
of an objective beauty and should demand of the artist perfect
self-control and self-repression. For such an art personal emotion was
proclaimed a hindrance, as it might dim the artist's vision or make
his hand unsteady. Those who viewed art in this way, while they turned
frankly away from the earlier Romanticists, yet agreed with them in
their concern for form, and applied themselves to carrying still
farther the technical mastery over it which they had achieved. Their
standpoint greatly emphasized the importance of good workmanship, and
the stress laid upon form was revealed, among other ways, by a revival
of the old fixed forms. The young generation of poets that began to
write just after the middle of the century, generally recognized
LECONTE DE LISLE as their master, and were called _Parnassiens_ from
_le Parnasse contemporain_, a collection of verse to which they
contributed. They produced a surprising amount of work distinguished
by exquisite finish, and making up for a certain lack of spontaneity
by intellectual fervor and strong repressed emotion.

But the rights of subjective personal emotion could not long be
denied in lyric poetry. Even LECONTE DE LISLE had not succeeded in
obliterating its traces entirely, and if he achieved a calm that
justifies the epithet _impassible_, given so freely to him and to his
followers, it is at the cost of a struggle that still vibrates beneath
the surface of his lines. Presently emotion asserted its authority
again, more discreetly and under the restraint of an imperious
intellect in SULLY PRUDHOMME, readily taking the form of sympathy with
the humble, in FRANCOIS COPPEE, or returning to the old communicative
frankness of self-revelation with VERLAINE. With VERLAINE we reach
a conscious reaction from the objective and impersonal art of the
_Parnassiens_. That art found its end in the perfect rendering
of objective reality. The reaction sought to get at the inner
significance and spiritual meaning of things, and looked at the
objective reality as a veil behind which a deeper sense lies hidden,
as a symbol which it is the poet's business to penetrate and illumine.
It also moved away from the clear images, precise contours, and
firm lines by which the _Parnassiens_ had given such an effect of
plasticity to their verse, and sought rather vague, shadowy, and
nebulous impressions and the charm of music and melody (cf. VERLAINE'S
poem, _Art poetique_, p. 288). This is in general the direction taken
by the latest generation of poets, symbolists, decadents, or however
otherwise they are styled, for whom VERLAINE'S influence has been
conspicuous. They make up rather an incoherent body, whose aims and
aspirations, more or less vague, are by no means adequately indicated
by this brief statement of their tendency. They have by no means said
their last word. But the accomplishment of their movement hitherto has
been marred, and its promise for the future is still threatened, by a
fatal and seemingly irresistible tendency toward unintelligibility.

VERSIFICATION.


The rules of French versification have not always been the same.
The classical movement of the seventeenth century in its reforms
proscribed certain things, like hiatus, overflow lines, mute _e_
before the caesura, which had been current hitherto, and the
Romanticists of this century have endeavored to give greater diversity
and flexibility to verse-structure both by restoring some of these
liberties and by introducing new ones. Especially have great
innovations been advocated in the last few years by the youngest
school of poets, but they have as yet found no general acceptance.

The unit of French versification is not a fixed number of long and
short, or accented and unaccented, syllables in a certain definite
arrangement, that is, a foot, but a line. A line is a certain number
of syllables ending in a rhyme which binds it to one or more other
lines. The lines found in lyric verse vary in length from one to
thirteen syllables; but lines with an even number of syllables are
much more used than those with an odd number.

In determining the number of syllables the general rules of syllabic
division are followed, and each vowel or diphthong involves a
syllable. But the following points are to be noted:

1. Mute _e_ final or followed by _s_ or _nt_ is not counted at the end
of the line.

2. Final mute _e_ in the body of the line is not counted as a syllable
before a word beginning with a vowel or mute _h_ (elision).

3. Mute _e_ in the termination of the third person plural, imperfect
and conditional, of verbs is not counted; nor is it counted in the
future and conditional of verbs of the first conjugation whose stem
ends in a vowel (_oublieront_, also written in verse _oubliront_; see
p. 130, l. 14).

4. When two or more vowel sounds other than mute _e_ come together
within a word they are sometimes treated as a diphthong and make but
one syllable, sometimes separated and counted as two. Usage is not
altogether consistent in this particular; the same combination is
in some words pronounced as two syllables (_ni-ais, li-en, pri-ere,
pri-ons, jou-et_), in others as one (_biais, rien, bar-riere,
ai-mions, fou-et_); and even the same word is sometimes variable
(_ancien, hier, duel_). In general such combinations are monosyllabic
if they have developed from a single vowel in the Latin parent word.

5. Certain words allow a different spelling according to the demands
of the verse (_encore_ or _encor_, _Charles_ or _Charle_).

Since the sixteenth century, hiatus has been forbidden by the rules of
French versification. But, as we have just seen (under 4 above), two
vowels are allowed to come together in the interior of a word. What
the rule against hiatus does proscribe then is the use of a word
ending in a vowel (except mute _e_, which is elided; cf. 2 above)
before a word beginning with a vowel or mute _h_, and the use of words
in which mute _e_ not final follows a vowel in the interior of the
word; e.g. _tu as, et ont, livree jolie; louent, allees_. But hiatus
is not regarded as existing when two vowels are brought together by
the elision of a mute _e_; e.g. in Hugo's lines, the _vie a_ in

    L'ouragan de leur vie a pris toutes les pages (p. 108, l. 20),
    and the _joie et_ in
    Sois ma force et ma joie et mon pilier d'airain (p. 130, l. 8).

Cf. also 1 and 3 above.

The rhythm of the line comes from the relation of its stressed to its
unstressed syllables. All lines have a stress (_leve_) on the rhyme
syllable, and if they have more than four syllables they have one or
more other stresses. Lines that consist of more than eight syllables
are usually broken by a caesural pause, which must follow a stressed
syllable. In lines of ten syllables the pause comes generally after
the fourth syllable, sometimes after the fifth; in lines of twelve
syllables, after the sixth.

The line of twelve syllables is the most important and widely used
of all and is known as the Alexandrine, from a poem of the twelfth
century celebrating the exploits of Alexander the Great, which is one
of the earliest examples of its use. It is almost without exception
the measure of serious and dignified dramatic and narrative poetry,
and even in lyric verse it is used more frequently than any other.
From MALHERBE to VICTOR HUGO the accepted rule demanded a caesura
after the sixth syllable and a pause at the end of the line; this
divided the line into two equal portions and separated each line from
its neighbors, preventing the overflow (_enjambement_) of one line
into the next. The line thus constructed had two fixed stresses, one
on the sixth syllable, before the caesura, which therefore had to
be the final syllable of a word and could not have mute _e_ for its
vowel, and another on the final (twelfth) syllable. There are indeed
in the poets of that period examples of lines in which, when naturally
read, the most considerable pause falls in some other position; but
the line always offers in the sixth place a syllable capable of a
principal stress. There was also regularly one other stressed syllable
in each half-line; it might be any one of the first five syllables,
but is most frequently the third, second, or fourth, rarely the first
or fifth; but the secondary stress might be wanting altogether;
a third stressed syllable in the half-line sometimes occurs. The
Romanticists introduced a somewhat greater flexibility into the
Alexandrine line by permitting the displacement or suppression of the
caesura and the overflow of one line into the next; the displacement
of the caesura sometimes goes so far as to put in the sixth place in
the line a syllable quite incapable of receiving a stress.

In the following stanza of Lamartine (see p. 60), which consists of
Alexandrine lines of the classical type, the stressed syllables are
indicated by italics and the caesura by a dash:

    Sal_u_t, bois couronn_e_s--d'un r_e_ste de verd_u_re!
    Feuill_a_ges jauniss_a_nts--sur les gaz_o_ns ep_a_is!
    Sal_u_t, derniers beaux j_ou_rs!--Le d_eu_il de la nat_u_re
    Conv_ie_nt a la doul_eu_r--et pl_ai_t a mes reg_a_rds.

Cf. for examples of displaced caesura, Hugo's lines--

    Je marcher_ai_--les yeux fix_e_s sur mes pens_e_es (p. 121,l. 25.)
    Seul, inconn_u_,--le dos courb_e_,--les mains crois_e_es (p. 121,
    l. 27.)

For examples of enjambement, cf. Leconte de Lisle's Lines--

    L'ecclesi_a_ste a d_i_t:--Un chien viv_a_nt vaut mi_eu_x
    Qu'un lion m_o_rt (p. 201, l. 21).
    O boucher_i_e!--o soif du m_eu_rtre!--acharnem_e_nt
    Horr_i_ble! (p. 210, l. 21).

Unrhymed lines (blank verse) and lines of which only the alternate
ones rhyme have been tried but discarded.

Rhyme is therefore an indispensable element of French verse, and is
vastly more important as a poetic ornament than it is in English;
so important that Sainte-Beuve calls it the sole harmony (_l'unique
harmonie_) of verse. Rhyme may be either masculine, when it involves
but one syllable (_divinite: majeste_, _toi: roi_), or feminine,
when it involves two syllables the second of which contains mute _e_
(_repose: rose_, _changees: ravagees_); and lines are called masculine
or feminine according to their rhymes. Masculine rhymes must
constantly alternate with feminine rhymes; that is, two masculine or
feminine lines of different rhymes may never come together; but the
younger poets have sought a greater liberty here as elsewhere, and
poems with but one kind of rhyme occur (see p. 208). Rhyme to be
perfect must satisfy the eye as well as the ear; masculine rhymes must
have identity of vowel sound and the final consonants must be the same
or such as would have the same sound if pronounced (_granit: nid_,
_heros: bourreaux_; not _different: tyran_); but silent consonants
between the vowel and the final consonant do not count (_essaims:
saints_, _corps: morts_). Feminine rhymes must have identity of
rhyming vowels and of following consonant sounds if there be any; and
the final consonants must be the same (_fideles: citadelles_, _jolie:
crie_; not _nuages: louage_). Variations from ordinary spelling are
sometimes used to make words satisfy this rule of rhyming for the eye
(_je vien_, _je voi_), but they are hardly approved. The ear seems
even sometimes to play the subordinate role in the rhyme, for words
are found in rhyme which satisfy the eye but not the ear (_Venus:
nus_). Rhyme as above described is called sufficient (_suffisante_);
if it also involve identity of the consonant preceding the rhyming
vowel (_consonne d'appui_) it is called rich (_riche_); (examples:
_etoiles: toiles_, _bandit_;

The French ear is unlike the English in considering _rime riche_ an
additional beauty; the Romanticists especially have cultivated it, and
there are whole poems where simply sufficient rhyme is the exception.
A word may not rhyme with itself, but words identical in form but
different in meaning may rhyme with each other (cf. first, fifth, and
eleventh stanzas of _les Djinns_, p. 95.

By the use of lines of different length and especially by the
arrangement of the rhymes a great variety of stanza forms has been
created, as well as certain definite forms for complete short
compositions, known as fixed forms. The most common are the _ballade_,
_rondel_, _rondeau_, and _triolet_, developed especially in the
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries and revived in our own, and the
sonnet, introduced from Italy during the Renaissance.

The _ballade_ consists of three stanzas, of eight or ten lines each,
that repeat exactly the same rhyme arrangement, and of a shorter
stanza of four or five lines, called the _envoy_, which repeats the
rhyme arrangement of the second part of the other stanzas. The line of
the ballade has generally eight syllables, but may have ten or twelve
(see pp. 1, 4, 5, 235).

The _rondel_, as usually printed, consists of three parts, the first
of four lines, the second of four, the last two of which are the first
two of the first part, and the third of five, the last one of which is
the first one of the first part; there are but two rhymes throughout.
The lines of the _rondel_ have usually eight syllables. This form was
practically superseded by the rondeau (see pp. 2 and 3).

The _rondeau_ also consists of three parts; the first has five lines,
the second three, and the third five, and the first word or words of
the first line, usually the first half of the line, are repeated at
the end of the second and third parts; there are but two rhymes. The
lines of the _rondeau_ have also usually eight syllables (see p. 6).

The _triolet_ consists of eight lines, usually octosyllabic. The first
line is twice repeated, in the fourth and seventh places, and the
second line is repeated once, making the final one. There are but two
rhymes (see p. 298).

The _sonnet_ has fourteen lines, usually Alexandrines, and is made up
of two parts, one of eight lines, called the octave, and one of six,
called the sestet; the rule allows but two rhymes to the octave
and three others to the sestet; the arrangement of the rhymes
is inflexible for the strict Petrarchan type (see below), but
considerable variations from it are common. For sonnets of the strict
type see pp. 257, 263, 280; for others showing variations see pp. 8,
13, 14, 199.

The rhyme arrangement of these various forms is most clearly shown
by letters as follows, capital letters indicating lines that are
repeated. _Ballade_: eight lines, _ababbcbC_, _ababbcbC_, _ababbcbC_,
_bcbC_; ten lines, _ababbccdcD_, _ababbccdcD_, _ababbccdcD_, _ccdcD_.
_Rondel: ABba_, _abAB_, _abbaA_. _Rondeau: aabba_, _aab refrain_,
_aabba refrain_. _Triolet: ABaAabAB_. _Sonnet: abba abba ccdede_.

Nouvelles ont couru en France,
Par maints lieux, que j'estoye mort
Dont avoient peu de desplaisance
Aucuns qui me hayent a tort;
Autres en ont eu desconfort,
Qui m'ayment de loyal vouloir,
Comme mes bons et vrais amis;
Si fais a toutes gens savoir
Qu'encore est vive la souris.

Que paix, qui trop longuement dort,

A tous fera liesse avoir ;
Pour ce, de Dieu soyent maudis
Ceux qui sont dolens de veoir
Qu'encore est vive la souris.

Jeunesse sur moy a puissance,
Mais Vieillesse fait son effort
De m'avoir en sa gouvernance;
A present faillira son sort,
Je suis assez loing de son port.

De pleurer vueil garder mon hoir;
Loue soit Dieu de Paradis,
Qui m'a donne force et povoir,
Qu'encore est vive la souris.

Nul ne porte pour moy le noir.
On vent meilleur marchie drap gris;
Or tiengne chascun, pour tout voir,
Qu'encore est vive la souris.

Gouttes d'argent, d'orfavrerie,
Chascun s'abille de nouveau:

La gracieuse, bonne et belle!

Par deca, ne dela la mer
Ne scay dame ne damoiselle
Qui soit en tous biens parfaits telle--
C'est ung songe que d'y penser:
Dieu! qu'il la fait bon regarder!

Qui chantait a voix de sereine;
Berthe au grand pied, Bietris, Allys
Harembourges, qui tint le Mayne,

Au bon vieulx temps un train d'amour regnoit
Qui sans grand art et dons se demenoit,
Si qu'un bouquet donne d'amour profonde,
C'estoit donne toute la terre ronde,
Car seulement au cueur on se prenoit.

Et si par cas a jouyr on venoit,
Scavez-vous bien comme on s'entretenoit?
Vingt ans, trente ans: cela duroit un monde
     Au bon vieulx temps.

Or est perdu ce qu'amour ordonnoit:
Rien que pleurs feincts, rien que changes on n'oyt.
Qui vouldra donc qu'a aymer je me fonde,
Il faut premier que l'amour on refonde,
Et qu'on la meine ainsi qu'on la menoit
     Au bon vieulx temps.




PIERRE DE RONSARD


A CASSANDRE

Mignonne, allons voir si la rose
Qui, ce matin, avoit desclose
Sa robe de pourpre au soleil,
A point perdu, cette vespree
Les plis de sa robe pourpree
Et son teint au vostre pareil.

Las! voyez comme, en peu d'espace,
Mignonne, elle a dessus la place,
Las, las, ses beautez laisse cheoir!
O vrayment marastre nature,
Puisqu'une telle fleur ne dure
Que du matin jusques au soir!

Donc, si vous me croyez, mignonne,
Tandis que votre age fleuronne
En sa plus verte nouveaute,
Cueillez, cueillez vostre jeunesse:
Comme a cette fleur, la vieillesse
Fera ternir vostre beaute.


CHANSON

Pour boire dessus l'herbe tendre
Je veux sous un laurier m'estendre.
Et veux qu'Amour d'un petit brin
Ou de lin ou de cheneviere
Trousse au flanc sa robe legere
Et my-nud me verse du vin.

L'incertaine vie de l'homme
De jour en jour se roule comme
Aux rives se roulent les flots:
Puis apres notre heure derniere
Rien de nous ne reste en la biere
Qu'une vieille carcasse d'os.

Je ne veux, selon la coustume,
Que d'encens ma tombe on parfume,
Ny qu'on y verse des odeurs :
Mais tandis que je suis en vie,
J'ai de me parfumer envie,
Et de me couronner de fleurs.

De moy-mesme je me veux faire
L'heritier pour me satisfaire :
Je ne veux vivre pour autruy.
Fol le pelican qui se blesse
Pour les siens, et fol qui se laisse
Pour les siens travailler d'ennuy.


SONNET

A HELENE

Quand vous serez bien vieille, au soir, a la chandelle,
Assise aupres du feu, devisant et filant,
Direz, chantant mes vers, en vous esmerveillant :
Ronsard me celebroit du temps que j'estois belle.

Lors vous n'aurez servante oyant telle nouvelle
Desja sous le labeur a demy sommeillant,
Qui au bruit de mon nom ne s'aille resveillant,
Benissant vostre nom de louange immortelle.

Je seray sous la terre, et, fantosme sans os,
Par les ombres myrteux je prendray mon repos:
Vous serez au foyer une vieille accroupie,

Regrettant mon amour et vostre fier desdain.
Vivez, si m'en croyez, n'attendez a demain:
Cueillez des aujourd'huy les roses de la vie.


ELEGIE

Quand je suis vingt ou trente mois
Sans retourner en Vendomois,
Plein de pensees vagabondes,
Plein d'un remors et d'un souci,
Aux rochers je me plains ainsi,
Aux bois, aux antres et aux ondes:

Rochers, bien que soyez agez
De trois mil ans, vous ne changez
Jamais ny d'estat ny de forme :
Mais toujours ma jeunesse fuit,
Et la vieillesse qui me suit
De jeune en vieillard me transforme.

Bois, bien que perdiez tous les ans
En hyver vos cheveux mouvans,
L'an d'apres qui se renouvelle
Renouvelle aussi vostre chef.
Mais le mien ne peut de rechef
Ravoir sa perruque nouvelle.

Antres, je me suis vu chez vous
Avoir jadis verds les genous,
Le corps habile et la main bonne:
Mais ores j'ai le corps plus dur
Et les genous, que n'est le mur
Qui froidement vous environne.

Ondes, sans fin vous promenez
Et vous menez et ramenez
Vos flots d'un cours qui ne sejourne:
Et moy sans faire long sejour,
Je m'en vais de nuict et de jour
Au lieu d'ou plus on ne retourne.


DIEU VOUS GARD

Dieu vous gard, messagers fidelles
Du printemps, vistes arondelles,
Huppes, coucous, rossignolets,
Tourtres, et vous oiseaux sauvages
Qui de cent sortes de ramages
Animez les bois verdelets!

Dieu vous gard, belles paquerettes.
Belles roses, belles fleurettes,
Et vous, boutons jadis cognus
Du sang d'Ajax et de Narcisse:
Et vous, thym, anis et melisse,
Vous soyez les bien revenus.

Dieu vous gard, troupe diapree
De papillons, qui par la pree
Les douces herbes sucotez:
Et vous, nouvel essaim d'abeilles
Qui les fleurs jaunes et vermeilles
De vostre bouche baisotez!

Cent mille fois je resalue
Vostre belle et douce venue:
O que j'aime ceste saison
Et ce doux caquet des rivages,
Au prix des vents et des orages
Qui m'enfermoient en la maison.

Bel aubespin verdissant,
     Fleurissant
Le long de ce beau rivage,
Tu es vestu jusqu'au bas
     Des longs bras
D'une lambrunche sauvage.

Deux camps de rouges fourmis
     Se sont mis
En garnison sous ta souche:
Dans les pertuis de ton tronc
     Tout du long
Les avettes ont leur couche.

Le chantre rossignolet
     Nouvelet
Courtisant sa bien aimee,
Pour ses amours alleger
     Vient loger
Tous les ans en ta ramee.

Sur ta cyme il fait son ny
     Tout uny
De mousse et de fine soye
Ou ses petits esclorront,
     Qui seront
De mes mains la douce proye.

Or vy, gentil aubespin,
     Vy sans fin,
Vy sans que jamais tonnerre
Ou la cognee ou les vents
     Ou les temps
Te puissent ruer par terre.


ELEGIE CONTRE LES BUCHERONS DE LA FORET DE GASTINE

Escoute, bucheron, arreste un peu le bras:
Ce ne sont pas des bois que tu jettes a bas;
Ne vois-tu pas le sang lequel degoute a force
Des nymphes qui vivoient dessous la dure escorce?
Sacrilege meurtrier, si on pend un voleur
Pour piller un butin de bien peu de valeur,
Combien de feux, de fers, de morts et de detresses
Merites-tu, meschant, pour tuer nos deesses?

Forest, haute maison des oiseaux bocagers!
Plus le cerf solitaire et les chevreuls legers
Ne paistront sous ton ombre, et ta verte criniere
Plus du soleil d'este ne rompra la lumiere.

Plus l'amoureux pasteur sus un tronq adosse,
Enflant son flageolet a quatre trous perse,
Son mastin a ses pieds, a son flanc la houlette,
Ne dira plus l'ardeur de sa belle Janette:
Tout deviendra muet; Echo sera sans vois;
Tu deviendras campagne, et en lieu de tes bois,
Dont l'ombrage incertain lentement se remue,
Tu sentiras le soc, le coutre et la charrue;
Tu perdras ton silence, et Satyres et Pans,
Et plus le cerf chez toy ne cachera ses fans.

Adieu, vieille forest, le jouet de Zephire,
Ou premier j'accorday les langues de ma lyre,
Ou premier j'entendi les fleches resonner
D'Apollon, qui me vint tout le coeur estonner;
Ou premier admirant la belle Calliope,
Je devins amoureux de sa neuvaine trope,
Quand sa main sur le front cent roses me jetta,
Et de son propre laict Euterpe m'allaita.

Adieu, vieille forest, adieu, testes sacrees,
De tableaux et de fleurs en tout temps reverees,
Maintenant le desdain des passans alterez,
Qui, bruslez en l'este des rayons etherez,
Sans plus trouver le frais de tes douces verdures,
Accusent tes meurtriers, et leur disent injures!

Adieu, chesnes, couronne aux vaillans citoyens,
Arbres de Jupiter, germes Dordoneens,
Qui premiers aux humains donnastes a repaistre;
Peuples vrayment ingrats, qui n'ont sceu recognoistre
Les biens receus de vous, peuples vrayment grossiers,
De massacrer ainsi leurs peres nourriciers!

Que l'homme est malheureux qui au monde se fie!
O dieux, que veritable est la philosophie,
Qui dit que toute chose a la fin perira,
Et qu'en changeant de forme une autre vestira!

De Tempe la vallee un jour sera montagne,
Et la cyme d'Athos une large campagne:
Neptune quelquefois de ble sera couvert:
La matiere demeure et la forme se perd.

Si nostre vie est moins qu'une journee
En l'eternel, si l'an qui fait le tour
Chasse nos jours sans espoir de retour,
Si perissable est toute chose nee,

Que songes-tu, mon ame emprisonnee?
Pourquoy te plaist l'obscur de nostre jour,
Si pour voler en un plus clair sejour,
Tu as au dos l'aile bien empennee?

La est le bien que tout esprit desire,
La le repos ou tout le monde aspire,
La est l'amour, la le plaisir encore.

La, o mon ame, au plus haut ciel guidee.
Tu y pourras recognoistre l'idee
De la beaute qu'en ce monde j'adore.


L'AMOUR DU CLOCHER

Heureux qui, comme Ulysse, a fait un beau voyage,
Ou comme cestuy la qui conquit la toison,
Et puis est retourne, plein d'usage et raison,
Vivre entre ses parens le reste de son age!

Quand reverray-je, helas! de mon petit village
Fumer la cheminee, et en quelle saison,
Reverray-je le clos de ma pauvre maison,
Qui m'est une province, et beaucoup davantage?

Plus me plaist le sejour qu'ont basty mes ayeux,
Que des palais romains le front audacieux,
Plus que le marbre dur me plaist l'ardoise fine;

Plus mon Loyre gaulois que le Tybre latin,
Plus mon petit Lire que le mont Palatin
Et plus que l'air marin la douceur Angevine.


D'UN VANNEUR DE BLED, AUX VENTS

A vous, trouppe legere,
Qui d'aile passagere
Par le monde volez
Et d'un sifflant murmure
L'ombrageuse verdure
Doucement esbranlez:

J'offre ces violettes,
Ces lis et ces fleurettes,
Et ces roses ici,
Ces merveillettes roses,
Tout freschement ecloses,
Et ces oeillets aussi.

De vostre douce haleine
Eventez ceste plaine,
Eventez ce sejour,
Ce pendant que j'ahanne
A mon ble que je vanne
A la chaleur du jour.




D'AUBIGNE


L'HYVER

Mes volages humeurs, plus sterilles que belles,
S'en vont; et je leur dis: Vous sentez, irondelles,
S'esloigner la chaleur et le froid arriver.
Allez nicher ailleurs, pour ne tascher, impures,
Ma couche de babil et ma table d'ordures;
Laissez dormir en paix la nuict de mon hyver.

D'un seul point le soleil n'esloigne l'hemisphere;
Il jette moins d'ardeur, mais autant de lumiere.
Je change sans regrets, lorsque je me repens
Des frivoles amours et de leur artifice.
J'ayme l'hyver qui vient purger mon coeur de vice,
Comme de peste l'air, la terre de serpens.

Mon chef blanchit dessous les neiges entassees,
Le soleil, qui reluit, les eschauffe, glacees,
Mais ne les peut dissoudre, au plus court de ses mois.
Fondez, neiges; venez dessus mon coeur descendre,
Qu'encores il ne puisse allumer de ma cendre
Du brazier, comme il fit des flammes autrefois.

Mais quoi! serai-je esteint devant ma vie esteinte?
Ne luira plus sur moi la flamme vive et sainte,
Le zele flamboynt de la sainte maison?
Je fais aux saints autels holocaustes des restes,
De glace aux feux impurs, et de napthe aux celestes:
Clair et sacre flambeau, non funebre tison!

Voici moins de plaisirs, mais voici moins de peines.
Le rossignol se taist, se taisent les sereines:
Nous ne voyons cueillir ni les fruits ni les fleurs;
L'esperance n'est plus bien souvent tromperesse;
L'hyver jouit de tout. Bienheureuse vieillesse,
La saison de l'usage, et non plus des labeurs!

Mais la mort n'est pas loin; cette mort est suivie
D'un vivre sans mourir, fin d'une fausse vie:
Vie de nostre vie, et mort de nostre mort.
Qui hait la seurete pour aimer le naufrage?
Qui a jamais este si friand de voyage,
Que la longueur en soit plus douce que le port?




JEAN BERTAUT


CHANSON

         Les Cieux inexorables
         Me sont si rigoureux,
         Que les plus miserables
Se comparans a moy se trouveraient heureux.

         Je ne fais a toute heure
         Que souhaiter la mort,
         Dont la longue demeure
Prolonge dessus moy l'insolence du Sort.

         Mon lict est de mes larmes
         Trempe toutes les nuits:
         Et ne peuvent ses charmes,
Lors mesme que je dors, endormir mes ennuis.

         Si je fay quelque songe
         J'en suis espouvante,
         Car mesme son mensonge
Exprime de mes maux la triste verite.

         Toute paix, toute joye
         A pris de moy conge,
         Laissant mon ame en proye
A cent mille soucis dont mon coeur est ronge.

         La pitie, la justice,
         La constance, et la foy,
         Cedant a l'artifice,
Dedans les coeurs humains sont esteintes pour moy.

         L'ingratitude paye
         Ma fidelle amitie:
         La calomnie essaye
A rendre mes tourments indignes de pitie.

         En un cruel orage
         On me laisse perir,
         Et courant au naufrage
Je voy chacun me plaindre et nul me secourir.

         Et ce qui rend plus dure
         La misere ou je vy,
         C'est, es maux que j'endure,
La memoire de l'heur que le Ciel m'a ravi.

         Felicite passee
         Qui ne peux revenir:
         Tourment de ma pensee,
Que n'ai-je en te perdant perdu le souvenir!

         Helas! il ne me reste
         De mes contentements
         Qu'un souvenir funeste,
Qui me les convertit a toute heure en tourments.

         Le sort plein d'injustice
         M'ayant en fin rendu
         Ce reste un pur supplice,
Je serois plus heureux si j'avois plus perdu.




MATHURIN REGNIER


ODE

Jamais ne pourray-je bannir
Hors de moy l'ingrat souvenir
De ma gloire si tost passee?
Toujours pour nourrir mon soucy.
Amour, cet enfant sans mercy,
L'offrira-t-il a ma pensee!

Tyran implacable des coeurs,
De combien d'ameres langueurs
As-tu touche ma fantaisie !
De quels maux m'as-tu tourmente!
Et dans mon esprit agite
Que n'a point fait la jalousie !

Mes yeux, aux pleurs accoutumez,
Du sommeil n'estoient plus fermez;
Mon coeur fremissoit sous la peine:
A veu d'oeil mon teint jaunissoit;
Et ma bouche qui gemissoit,
De soupirs estoit toujours pleine.

Aux caprices abandonne,
J'errois d'un esprit forcene,
La raison cedant a la rage:
Mes sens, des desirs emportez,
Flottoient, confus, de tous costez,
Comme un vaisseau parmy l'orage.

Blasphemant la terre et les cieux,
Mesmes je m'estois odieux,
Tant la fureur troubloit mon ame:
Et bien que mon sang amasse
Autour de mon coeur fust glace,
Mes propos n'estoient que de flame.

Pensif, frenetique et resvant,
L'esprit trouble, la teste au vent,
L'oeil hagard, le visage blesme,
Tu me fis tous maux esprouver;
Et sans jamais me retrouver,
Je m'allois cherchant en moy-mesme.

Cependant lors que je voulois,
Par raison enfraindre tes loix,
Rendant ma flame refroidie,
Pleurant, j'accusay ma raison
Et trouvay que la guerison
Est pire que la maladie.

Un regret pensif et confus
D'avoir este, et n'estre plus,
Rend mon ame aux douleurs ouverte;
A mes despens, las! je vois bien
Qu'un bonheur comme estoit le mien
Ne se cognoist que par la perte.




FRANCOIS DE MALHERBE


CONSOLATION A MONSIEUR DU PERIER

Ta douleur, du Perier, sera donc eternelle,
     Et les tristes discours
Que te met en l'esprit l'amitie paternelle
     L'augmenteront toujours?

Le malheur de ta fille, au tombeau descendue
     Par un commun trepas,
Est-ce quelque dedale ou ta raison perdue
     Ne se retrouve pas?

Je sais de quels appas son enfance etait pleine,
     Et n'ai pas entrepris,
Injurieux ami, de soulager ta peine
     Avecque son mepris.

Mais elle etait du monde, ou les plus belles choses
     Ont le pire destin;
Et, rose, elle a vecu ce que vivent les roses,
     L'espace d'un matin.

Puis quand ainsi serait que, selon ta priere,
     Elle aurait obtenu
D'avoir en cheveux blancs termine sa carriere,
     Qu'en fut-il advenu?

Penses-tu que, plus vieille, en la maison celeste
     Elle eut eu plus d'accueil,
Ou qu'elle eut moins senti la poussiere funeste
     Et les vers du cercueil?

Non, non, mon du Perier; aussitot que la Parque
     Ote l'ame du corps,
L'age s'evanouit au deca de la barque,
     Et ne suit pas les morts.

Tithon n'a plus les ans qui le firent cigale,
     Et Pluton aujourd'hui,
Sans egard du passe, les merites egale
     D'Archemore et de lui.

Ne te lasse donc plus d'inutiles complaintes;
     Mais, sage a l'avenir,
Aime une ombre comme ombre, et des cendres eteintes
     Eteins le souvenir.

C'est bien, je le confesse, une juste coutume,
     Que le coeur afflige,
Par le canal des yeux vidant son amertume,
      Cherche d'etre allege.

Meme quand il advient que la tombe separe
     Ce que nature a joint,
Celui qui ne s'emeut a l'ame d'un barbare,
     Ou n'en a du tout point.

Mais d'etre inconsolable, et dedans sa memoire
     Enfermer un ennui,
N'est-ce pas se hair pour acquerir la gloire
     De bien aimer autrui?

Priam, qui vit ses fils abattus par Achille,
     Denue de support
Et hors de tout espoir du salut de sa ville,
     Recut du reconfort.

Francois, quand la Castille, inegale a ses armes,
     Lui vola son Dauphin,
Sembla d'un si grand coup devoir jeter des larmes
     Qui n'eussent point de fin.

Il les secha pourtant, et comme un autre Alcide
     Contre fortune instruit,
Fit qu'a ses ennemis d'un acte si perfide
     La honte fut le fruit.

Leur camp, qui la Durance avoit presque tarie
     De bataillons epais,
Entendant sa constance eut peur de sa furie,
     Et demanda la paix.

De moi, deja deux fois d'une pareille foudre
     Je me suis vu perclus,
Et deux fois la raison m'a si bien fait resoudre
     Qu'il ne m'en souvient plus.

Non qu'il ne me soit grief que la terre possede
     Ce qui me fut si cher;
Mais en un accident qui n'a point de remede,
     Il n'en faut point chercher.

La mort a des rigueurs a nulle autre pareilles;
     On a beau la prier,
La cruelle qu'elle est se bouche les oreilles,
     Et nous laisse crier.

Le pauvre en sa cabane, ou le chaume le couvre,
     Est sujet a ses lois;
Et la garde qui veille aux barrieres du Louvre
     N'en defend point nos Rois.

De murmurer contre elle et perdre patience
       Il est mal a propos;
Vouloir ce que Dieu veut est la seule science
       Qui nous met en repos.


CHANSON

Ils s'en vont, ces rois de ma vie,
     Ces yeux ces beaux yeux
Dont l'eclat fait palir d'envie
     Ceux meme des cieux.
Dieux amis de l'innocence,
Qu'ai-je fait pour meriter
Les ennuis ou cette absence
     Me va precipiter?

Elle s'en va, cette merveille
     Pour qui nuit et jour,
Quoi que la raison me conseille,
     Je brule d'amour.
Dieux amis, etc.

En quel effroi de solitude
     Assez ecarte
Mettrai-je mon inquietude
     En sa liberte?
Dieux amis, etc.

Les affliges ont en leurs peines
     Recours a pleurer;
Mais quand mes yeux seraient fontaines,
     Que puis-je esperer?
Dieux amis, etc.


PARAPHRASE DU PSAUME CXLV

N'Esperons plus, mon ame, aux promesses du monde:
Sa lumiere est un verre, et sa faveur une onde
Que toujours quelque vent empeche de calmer.
Quittons ces vanites, lassons-nous de les suivr
      C'est Dieu qui nous fait vivre,
      C'est Dieu qu'il faut aimer.

En vain, pour satisfaire a nos laches envies,
Nous passons pres des rois tout le temps de nos vies
A souffrir des mepris et ployer les genoux.
Ce qu'ils peuvent n'est rien; ils sont comme nous sommes,
      Veritablement hommes,
      Et meurent comme nous.

Ont-ils rendu l'esprit, ce n'est plus que poussiere
Que cette majeste si pompeuse et si fiere
Dont l'eclat orgueilleux etonne l'univers;
Et dans ces grands tombeaux ou leurs ames hautaines,
      Font encore les vaines,
      Ils sont manges des vers.

La se perdent ces noms de maitres de la terre,
D'arbitres de la paix, de foudres de la guerre;
Comme ils n'ont plus de sceptre, ils n'ont plus de flatteurs,
Et tombent avec eux d'une chute commune
      Tous ceux que leur fortune
      Faisait leurs serviteurs.




RACINE


CHOEUR D'ESTHER

TOUT LE CHOEUR

Dieu fait triompher l'innocence;
Chantons, celebrons sa puissance.

UNE ISRAELITE

Il a vu contre nous les mechants s'assembler,
     Et notre sang pret a couler;
Comme l'eau sur la terre ils allaient le repandre:
Du haut du ciel sa voix s'est fait entendre,
     L'homme superbe est renverse,
     Ses propres fleches l'ont perce.

UNE AUTRE

J'ai vu l'impie adore sur la terre;
Pareil au cedre il cachait dans les cieux
    Son front audacieux;
Il semblait a son gre gouverner le tonnerre,
Foulait aux pieds ses ennemis vaincus:
Je n'ai fait que passer, il n'etait deja plus.

UNE AUTRE

Que le Seigneur est bon! que son joug est aimable!
Heureux qui des l'enfance en connait la douceur'
Jeune peuple, courez a ce maitre adorable;
Les biens les plus charmants n'ont rien de comparable

Aux torrents de plaisirs qu'il repand dans un coeur.
Que le Seigneur est bon! que son joug est aimable!
Heureux qui des l'enfance en connait la douceur!

UNE AUTRE

  Il s'apaise, il pardonne;
  Du coeur ingrat qui l'abandonne
    Il attend le retour;
  Il excuse notre faiblesse;
  A nous chercher meme il s'empresse:
  Pour l'enfant qu'elle a mis au jour
  Une mere a moins de tendresse.
Ah! qui peut avec lui partager notre amour!

TROIS ISRAELITES

Il nous fait remporter une illustre victoire.

L'UNE DES TROIS
  Il nous a revele sa gloire.

TOUTES TROIS ENSEMBLE

Ah! qui peut avec lui partager notre amour!

TOUT LE CHOEUR

Que son nom soit beni; que son nom soit chante;
  Que Ton celebre ses ouvrages
  Au dela des temps et des ages,
  Au dela de l'eternite.




JEAN-BAPTISTE ROUSSEAU


ODE A LA FORTUNE

Fortine dont la main couronne
Les forfaits les plus inouis,
Du faux eclat qui t'environne
Serons-nous toujours eblouis?
Jusques a quand, trompeuse idole,
D'un culte honteux et frivole
Honorerons-nous tes autels?
Verra-t-on toujours tes caprices
Consacres par les sacrifices
Et par l'hommage des mortels?

Apprends que la seule sagesse
Peut faire les heros parfaits;
Qu'elle voit toute la bassesse
De ceux que ta faveur a faits;
Qu'elle n'adopte point la gloire
Qui nait d'une injuste victoire
Que le sort remporte pour eux ;
Et que, devant ses yeux stoiques,
Leurs vertus les plus heroiques
Ne sont que des crimes heureux.

Quoi! Rome et l'Italie en cendre
Me feront honorer Sylla?
J'admirerai dans Alexandre
Ce que j'abhorre en Attila?
J'appellerai vertu guerriere
Une vaillance meurtriere
Qui dans mon sang trempe ses mains;
Et je pourrai forcer ma bouche
A louer un heros farouche,
Ne pour le malheur des humains?

Quels traits me presentent vos fastes,
Impitoyables conquerants!
Des voeux outres, des projets vastes,
Des rois vaincus par des tyrans;
Des murs que la flamme ravage,
Des vainqueurs fumants de carnage,
Un peuple au fer abandonne;
Des meres pales et sanglantes,
Arrachant leurs filles tremblantes
Des bras d'un soldat effrene.

Juges insenses que nous sommes,
Nous admirons de tels exploits!
Est-ce donc le malheur des hommes
Qui fait la vertu des grands rois?
Leur gloire, feconde en ruines,
Sans le meurtre et sans les rapines
Ne saurait-elle subsister?
Images des Dieux sur la terre,
Est-ce par des coups de tonnerre
Que leur grandeur doit eclater?

Montrez-nous, guerriers magnanimes,
Votre vertu dans tout son jour,
Voyons comment vos coeurs sublimes
Du sort soutiendront le retour.
Tant que sa faveur vous seconde,
Vous etes les maitres du monde,
Votre gloire nous eblouit;
Mais au moindre revers funeste,
Le masque tombe, l'homme reste,
Et le heros s'evanouit.




PARNY


SUR LA MORT D'UNE JEUNE FILLE

Son age echappait a l'enfance;
Riante comme l'innocence,
Elle avait les traits de l'Amour.
Quelques mois, quelques jours encore,
Dans ce coeur pur et sans detour
Le sentiment allait eclore.
Mais le ciel avait au trepas
Condamne ses jeunes appas;
Au ciel elle a rendu sa vie,
Et doucement s'est endormie,
Sans murmurer contre ses lois.
Ainsi le sourire s'efface;
Ainsi meurt sans laisser de trace
Le chant d'un oiseau dans les bois.




GILBERT


ADIEUX A LA VIE

J'ai revele mon coeur au Dieu de l'innocence;
      Il a vu mes pleurs penitents:
Il guerit mes remords, il m'arme de constance;
      Les malheureux sont ses enfants.

Mes ennemis, riant, ont dit dans leur colere:
      Qu'il meure et sa gloire avec lui!
Mais a mon coeur calme le Seigneur dit en pere:
      Leur haine sera ton appui.

A tes plus chers amis ils ont prete leur rage:
      Tout trompe ta simplicite:
Celui que tu nourris court vendre ton image
      Noire de sa mechancete.

Mais Dieu t'entend gemir; Dieu, vers qui te ramene
      Un vrai remords ne des douleurs;
Dieu qui pardonne, enfin, a la nature humaine
      D'etre faible dans les malheurs.

"J'eveillerai pour toi la pitie, la justice
      De l'incorruptible avenir.
Eux-meme epureront, par un long artifice,
      Ton honneur qu'ils pensent ternir."

Soyez beni, mon Dieu, vous qui daignez me rendre
      L'innocence et son noble orgueil;
Vous qui, pour proteger le repos de ma cendre,
      Veillerez pres de mon cercueil!

Au banquet de la vie, infortune convive,
      J'apparus un jour, et je meurs!
Je meurs, et sur ma tombe, ou lentement j'arrive,
      Nul ne viendra verser des pleurs.

Salut, champs que j'aimais, et vous, douce verdure,
      Et vous, riant exil des bois!
Ciel, pavillon de l'homme, admirable nature,
      Salut pour la derniere fois!

Ah! puissent voir longtemps votre beaute sacree
      Tant d'amis sourds a mes adieux!
Qu'ils meurent pleins de jours, que leur mort soit pleuree.
      Qu'un ami leur ferme les yeux!




ROUGET DE L'ISLE


LA MARSEILLAISE

Allons, enfants de la patrie,
Le jour de gloire est arrive;
Contre nous de la tyrannie
L'etendard sanglant est leve.
Entendez-vous dans ces campagnes
Mugir ces feroces soldats?
Ils viennent jusque dans nos bras
Egorger nos fils, nos compagnes!

La Marseillaise

Aux armes, citoyens! formez vos bataillons!
      Marchons, marchons!
Qu'un sang impur abreuve nos sillons!

   Que veut cette horde d'esclaves,
   De traitres, de rois conjures?
   Pour qui ces ignobles entraves,
   Ces fers des longtemps prepares?
   Francais, pour nous, ah! quel outrage!
   Quels transports il doit exciter!
   C'est nous qu'on ose mediter
   De rendre a l'antique esclavage!
         Aux armes, citoyens! etc.

   Quoi! ces cohortes etrangeres
   Feraient la loi dans nos foyers!
   Quoi! ces phalanges mercenaires
   Terrasseraient nos fiers guerriers!
   Grand Dieu! par des mains enchainees
   Nos fronts sous le joug se ploieraient!
   De vils despotes deviendraient
   Les maitres de nos destinees!
         Aux armes, citoyens! etc.

   Tremblez, tyrans, et vous, perfides,
   L'opprobre de tous les partis;
   Tremblez! vos projets parricides,
   Vont enfin recevoir leur prix!
   Tout est soldat pour vous combattre;
   S'ils tombent, nos jeunes heros,
   La France en produit de nouveaux
   Contre vous tout prets a se battre!
         Aux armes, citoyens! etc,

   Francais, en guerriers magnanimes,
   Portez ou retenez vos coups;
   Epargnez ces tristes victimes
   A regret s'armant contre nous;
   Mais ces despotes sanguinaires,
   Mais les complices de Bouille,
   Tous ces tigres qui sans pitie
   Dechirent le sein de leurs meres!
         Aux armes, citoyens, etc.

   Amour sacre de la patrie,
   Conduis, soutiens nos bras vengeurs,
   Liberte, Liberte cherie,
   Combats avec tes defenseurs!
   Sous nos drapeaux que la Victoire
   Accoure a tes males accents;
   Que tes ennemis expirants
   Voient ton triomphe et notre gloire
         Aux armes, citoyens! etc.

   Nous entrerons dans la carriere
   Quand nos aines n'y seront plus;
   Nous y trouveront leur poussiere
   Et la trace de leurs vertus!
   Bien moins jaloux de leur survivre
   Que de partager leur cercueil,
   Nous aurons le sublime orgueil
   De les venger ou de les suivre!

Aux armes, citoyens! formez vos bataillons!
      Marchons, marchons!
Qu'un sang impur abreuve nos sillons.




ANDRE CHENIER


LA JEUNE CAPTIVE

"L'epi naissant murit de la faux respecte;
Sans crainte du pressoir, le pampre tout l'ete
    Boit les doux presents de l'aurore;
Et moi, comme lui belle, et jeune comme lui,
Quoi que l'heure presente ait de trouble et d'ennui,
    Je ne veux pas mourir encore.

"Qu'un stoique aux yeux secs vole embrasser la mort,
Moi je pleure et j'espere; au noir souffle du nord
    Je plie et releve ma tete.
S'il est des jours amers, il en est de si doux!
Helas! quel miel jamais n'a laisse de degouts?
    Quelle mer n'a point de tempete ?

"L'illusion feconde habite dans mon sein:
D'une prison sur moi les murs pesent en vain,
    J'ai les ailes de l'esperance.
Echappee aux reseaux de l'oiseleur cruel,
Plus vive, plus heureuse, aux campagnes du ciel
    Philomele chante et s'elance.

"Est-ce a moi de mourir? Tranquille je m'endors,
Et tranquille je veille, et ma veille aux remords
    Ni mon sommeil ne sont en proie.
Ma bienvenue au jour me rit dans tous les yeux;
Sur des fronts abattus mon aspect dans ces lieux
    Ranime presque de la joie.

"Mon beau voyage encore est si loin de sa fin!
Je pars, et des ormeaux qui bordent le chemin
    J'ai passe les premiers a peine.
Au banquet de la vie a peine commence,
Un instant seulement mes levres ont presse
    La coupe en mes mains encor pleine.

"Je ne suis qu'au printemps, je veux voir la moisson;
Et, comme le soleil, de saison en saison
   Je veux achever mon annee.
Brillante sur ma tige et l'honneur du jardin,
Je n'ai vu luire encor que les feux du matin,
   Je veux achever ma journee.

"O mort! tu peux attendre: eloigne, eloigne-toi;
Va consoler les coeurs que la honte, l'effroi,
    Le pale desespoir devore.
Pour moi Pales encore a des asiles verts,
Les Amours des baisers, les Muses des concerts;
    Je ne veux pas mourir encore."

Ainsi, triste et captif, ma lyre toutefois
S'eveillait, ecoutant ces plaintes, cette voix,
    Ces voeux d'une jeune captive;
Et secouant le joug de mes jours languissants,
Aux douces lois des vers je pliais les accents
    De sa bouche aimable et naive.

Ces chants, de ma prison temoins harmonieux,
Feront a quelque amant des loisirs studieux
    Chercher quelle fut cette belle:
La grace decorait son front et ses discours,
Et, comme elle, craindront de voir finir leurs jours
    Ceux qui les passeront pres d'elle.


IAMBES

Quand au mouton belant la sombre boucherie
    Ouvre ses cavernes de mort;
Pauvres chiens et moutons, toute la bergerie
    Ne s'informe plus de son sort!
Les enfants qui suivaient ses ebats dans la plaine,
    Les vierges aux belles couleurs
Qui le baisaient en foule, et sur sa blanche laine
    Entrelacaient rubans et fleurs,
Sans plus penser a lui, le mangent s'il est tendre.
    Dans cet abime enseveli,
J'ai le meme destin. Je m'y devais attendre.
    Accoutumons-nous a l'oubli.
Oublies comme moi dans cet affreux repaire,
    Mille autres moutons, comme moi
Pendus aux crocs sanglants du charnier populaire,
    Seront servis au peuple-roi.
Que pouvaient mes amis? Oui, de leur main cherie
    Un mot, a travers ces barreaux,
A verse quelque baume en mon ame fletrie;
    De l'or peut-etre a mes bourreaux....
Mais tout est precipice. Ils ont eu droit de vivre.
    Vivez, amis, vivez contents!
En depit de Bavus, soyez lents a me suivre;
    Peut-etre en de plus heureux temps
J'ai moi-meme, a l'aspect des pleurs de l'infortune,
    Detourne mes regards distraits;
A mon tour, aujourd'hui, mon malheur importune;
    Vivez, amis, vivez en paix.

LE CHANT DU DEPART

UN DEPUTE DU PEUPLE.

La victoire en chantant nous ouvre la barriere;
       La liberte guide nos pas,
Et du nord au midi la trompette guerriere
      A sonne l'heure des combats.
      Tremblez, ennemis de la France,
      Rois ivres de sang et d'orgueil!
      Le peuple souverain s'avance;
      Tyrans, descendez au cercueil.

                 _Choeur des guerriers_.

      La republique nous appelle,
      Sachons vaincre ou sachons perir;
      Un Francais doit vivre pour elle,
      Pour elle un Francais doit mourir.


UNE MERE DE FAMILLE.

De nos yeux maternels ne craignez pas les larmes:
      Loin de nous de laches douleurs!
Nous devons triompher quand vous prenez les armes;
      C'est aux rois a verser des pleurs.
      Nous vous avons donne la vie,
      Guerriers, elle n'est plus a vous;
      Tous vos jours sont a la patrie;
      Elle est votre mere avant nous.

_Choeur des ineres de famille_--La republique, etc.

DEUX VIEILLARDS.

Que le fer paternel arme la main des brave;
      Songez a nous au champ de Mars;
Consacrez dans le sang des rois et des esclaves
      Le fer beni par vos vieillards;
      Et, rapportant sous la chaumiere
      Des blessures et des vertus,
      Venez fermer notre paupiere
      Quand les tyrans ne seront plus.

_Choeurs des vieillards_--La republique, etc.

UN ENFANT.

De Barra, de Viala le sort nous fait envie;
      Ils sont morts, mais ils ont vaincu!
Le lache accable d'ans n'a point connu la vie!
      Qui meurt pour le peuple a vecu.
      Vous etes vaillants, nous le sommes:
      Guidez-nous contre les tyrans;
      Les republicains sont des hommes,
      Les esclaves sont des enfants!

_Choeur des enfants_--La republique, etc.

UNE EPOUSE.

Partez, vaillants epoux, les combats sont vos fetes;
      Partez, modeles des guerriers;
Nous cueillerons des fleurs pour en ceindre vos tetes,
      Nos mains tresseront vos lauriers!
      Et si le temple de Memoire
      S'ouvrait a vos manes vainqueurs,
      Nos voix chanteront votre gloire,
      Nos flancs porteront vos vengeurs.

_Choeur des epouses_--La republique, etc.


UNE JEUNE FILLE.

Et nous, soeurs des heros, nous qui de l'hymenee
      Ignorons les aimables noeuds,
Si, pour s'unir un jour a notre destinee,
      Les citoyens forment des voeux,
      Qu'ils reviennent dans nos murailles,
      Beaux de gloire et de liberte,
      Et que leur sang dans les batailles
      Ait coule pour l'egalite.

_Choeur des jeunes filles_--La republique, etc.

TROIS GUERRIERS.

Sur le fer, devant Dieu, nous jurons a nos peres,
      A nos epouses, a nos soeurs,
A nos representants, a nos fils, a nos meres,
      D'aneantir les oppresseurs:
      En tous lieux, dans la nuit profonde
      Plongeant l'infame royaute,
      Les Francais donneront au monde
      Et la paix et la liberte!

_Choeur general_--La republique, etc.




ARNAULT


LA FEUILLE

"De ta tige detachee,
Pauvre feuille dessechee,
Ou vas-tu?"--Je n'en sais rien.
L'orage a brise le chene
Qui seul etait mon soutien;
De son inconstante haleine
Le zephyr ou l'aquilon

Depuis ce jour me promene
De la foret a ta plaine,
De la montagne au vallon.
Je vais ou le vent me mene,
Sans me plaindre ou m'effrayer;
Je vais ou va toute chose,
Ou va la feuille de rose
Et la feuille de laurier!




CHATEAUBRIAND


LE MONTAGNARD EXILE

Combien j'ai douce souvenance
Du joli lieu de ma naissance!
Ma soeur, qu'ils etaient beaux les jours
     De France!
  O mon pays, sois mes amours
     Toujours!

Te souvient-il que notre mere
Au foyer de notre chaumiere
Nous pressait sur son coeur joyeux,
     Ma chere!
  Et nous baisions ses blancs cheveux
     Tous deux.

Ma soeur, te souvient-il encore
Du chateau que baignait la Dore?
Et de cette tant vieille tour
     Du Maure,
Ou l'airain sonnait le retour
     Du jour?

Te souvient-il du lac tranquille
Qu'effleurait l'hirondelle agile;
Du vent qui courbait le roseau
     Mobile,
Et du soleil couchant sur l'eau
     Si beau?

Oh! qui me rendra mon Helene
Et ma montagne et le grand chene!
Leur souvenir fait tous les jours
     Ma peine:
Mon pays sera mes amours
     Toujours!




DESAUGIERS


MORALITE

Enfants de la folie,
      Chantons;
Sur les maux de la vie
      Glissons;
Plaisir jamais ne coute
      De pleurs;
Il seme notre route
      De fleurs.

Oui, portons son delire
      Partout....
Le bonheur est de rire
      De tout;
Pour etre aime des belles,
      Aimons;
Un beau jour changent-elles,
      Changeons.

Deja l'hiver de l'age
      Accourt;
Profitons d'un passage
      Si court;
L'avenir peut-il etre
      Certain?
Nous finirons peut-etre
      Demain.




CHARLES NODIER


LA JEUNE FILLE

Elle etait bien jolie, au matin, sans atours,
De son jardin naissant visitant les merveilles,
Dans leur nid d'ambroisie epiant ses abeilles,
Et du parterre en fleurs suivant les longs detours.

Elle etait bien jolie, au bal de la soiree,
Quand l'eclat des flambeaux illuminait son front,
Et que de bleus saphirs ou de roses paree
De la danse folatre elle menait le rond.

Elle etait bien jolie, a l'abri de son voile
Qu'elle livrait, flottant, au souffle de la nuit,
Quand pour la voir de loin, nous etions la sans bruit,
Heureux de la connaitre au reflet d'une etoile.

Elle etait bien jolie; et de pensers touchants,
D'un espoir vague et doux chaque jour embellie,
L'amour lui manquait seul pour etre plus jolie!....
Paix! ... voila son convoi qui passe dans les champs!....


LE BUISSON

S'il est un buisson quelque part
Borde de blancs fraisiers ou de noires prunelles,
Ou de l'oeil de la Vierge aux riantes prunelles,
Dans le creux des fosses, a l'abri d'un rempart!....

      Ah! si son ombre printaniere
Couvrait avec amour la pente d'un ruisseau,
D'un ruisseau qui bondit sans souci de son eau,
Et qui va rejouir l'espoir de la meuniere!....

      Si la liane aux blancs cornets
Y roulait en noeuds verts sur la branche embellie!
S'il protegeait au loin le muguet, l'ancolie,
Dont les filles des champs couronnent leurs bonnets!

      Si ce buisson, nid de l'abeille,
Attirait quelque jour une vierge aux yeux doux,
Qui viendrait en dansant, et sans penser a nous,
De boutons demi-clos enrichir sa corbeille!....

      S'il etait aime des oiseaux;
S'il voyait sautiller la mesange hardie;
S'il surveillait parfois la linotte etourdie,
Echappee en boitant au piege des reseaux!

      S'il souriait, depuis l'aurore,
A l'abord inconstant d'un leger papillon,
Tout bigarre d'azur, d'or et de vermillon,
Qui va, vole et revient, vole et revient encore!

      Si dans la brulante saison,
D'une nuit sans lumiere eclaircissant les voiles,
Les vers luisants venaient y semer leurs etoiles,
Qui de rayons d'argent blanchissent le gazon!....

      Si, longtemps, des feux du soleil
Il pouvait garantir une fosse inconnue!
Enfants! dites-le-moi, l'heure est si bien venue!
Il fait froid. Il est tard. Je souffre, et j'ai sommeil.




BERANGER


LE ROI D'YVETOT

Il etait un roi d'Yvetot
      Peu connu dans l'histoire,
Se levant tard, se couchant tot,
      Dormant fort bien sans gloire,
Et couronne par Jeanneton
D'un simple bonnet de coton,
      Dit-on.
Oh! oh! oh! oh! ah! ah! ah! ah!
Quel bon petit roi c'etait la!
      La, la.

Il faisait ses quatre repas
      Dans son palais de chaume,
Et sur un ane, pas a pas,
      Parcourait son royaume.
Joyeux, simple et croyant le bien,
Pour toute garde il n'avait rien
      Qu'un chien.
Oh! oh! oh! oh! ah! ah! ah! ah!
Quel bon petit roi c'etait la!
      La, la.

Il n'avait de gout onereux
      Qu'une soif un peu vive;
Mais, en rendant son peuple heureux,
      Il faut bien qu'un roi vive.
Lui-meme, a table et sans suppot,
Sur chaque muid levait un pot
      D'impot.
Oh! oh! oh! oh! ah! ah! ah! ah!
Quel bon petit roi c'etait la!
      La, la.

Aux filles de bonnes maisons
      Comme il avait su plaire,
Ses sujets avaient cent raisons
      De le nommer leur pere.
D'ailleurs il ne levait de ban
Que pour tirer, quatre fois l'an,
      Au blanc.
Oh! oh! oh! oh! ah! ah! ah! ah!
Quel bon petit roi c'etait la!
      La, la.

Il n'agrandit point ses Etats,
      Fut un voisin commode,
Et, modele des potentats,
      Prit le plaisir pour code.
Ce n'est que lorsqu'il expira
Que le peuple, qui l'enterra,
      Pleura.
Oh! oh! oh! oh! ah! ah! ah! ah!
Quel bon petit roi c'etait la!
      La, la.

On conserve encor le portrait
      De ce digne et bon prince:
C'est l'enseigne d'un cabaret
      Fameux dans la province.
Les jours de fete, bien souvent,
La foule s'ecrie en buvant
      Devant:
Oh! oh! oh! oh! ah! ah! ah! ah!
Quel bon petit roi c'etait la!
      La, la.


LE VILAIN

He quoi! j'apprends que l'on critique
Le _de_ qui precede mon nom.
Etes-vous de noblesse antique?
Moi, noble? oh! vraiment, messieurs, non.
Non, d'aucune chevalerie
Je n'ai le brevet sur velin.
Je ne sais qu'aimer ma patrie....
Je suis vilain et tres vilain....
      Je suis vilain,
      Vilain, vilain.

Ah! sans un _de_ j'aurais du naitre;
Car, dans mon sang si j'ai bien lu,
Jadis mes aieux ont d'un maitre
Maudit le pouvoir absolu.
Ce pouvoir, sur sa vieille base,
Etant la meule du moulin,
Ils etaient le grain qu'elle ecrase.
Je suis vilain et tres vilain,
      Je suis vilain,
      Vilain, vilain.

Jamais aux discordes civiles
Mes braves aieux n'ont pris part;
De l'Anglais aucun dans nos villes
N'introduisit le leopard;
Et quand l'Eglise, par sa brigue,
Poussait l'Etat vers son declin,
Aucun d'eux n'a signe la Ligue.
Je suis vilain et tres vilain,
      Je suis vilain,
      Vilain, vilain.

Laissez-moi donc sous ma banniere,
Vous, messieurs, qui, le nez au vent,
Nobles par votre boutonniere,
Encensez tout soleil levant.
J'honore une race commune,
Car, sensible, quoique malin,
Je n'ai flatte que l'infortune.
Je suis vilain et tres vilain,
      Je suis vilain,
      Vilain, vilain.


MON HABIT

Sois-moi fidele, o pauvre habit que j'aime!
Ensemble nous devenons vieux.
Depuis dix ans je te brosse moi-meme,
Et Socrate n'eut pas fait mieux.
Quand le sort a ta mince etoffe
Livrerait de nouveaux combats,
Imite-moi, resiste en philosophe:
Mon vieil ami, ne nous separons pas.

Je me souviens, car j'ai bonne memoire,
Du premier jour ou je te mis.
C'etait ma fete, et, pour comble de gloire,
Tu fus chante par mes amis.
Ton indigence, qui m'honore,
Ne m'a point banni de leurs bras.
Tous ils sont prets a nous feter encore:
Mon vieil ami, ne nous separons pas.

A ton revers j'admire une reprise:
C'est encore un doux souvenir.
Feignant un soir de fuir la tendre Lise,
Je sens sa main me retenir.
On te dechire, et cet outrage
Aupres d'elle enchaine mes pas.
Lisette a mis deux jours a tant d'ouvrage:
Mon vieil ami, ne nous separons pas.

T'ai-je impregne des flots de musc et d'ambre
Qu'un fat exhale en se mirant?
M'a-t-on jamais vu dans une antichambre
T'exposer au mepris d'un grand?
Pour des rubans la France entiere
Fut en proie a de longs debats;
La fleur des champs brille a ta boutonniere:
Mon vieil ami, ne nous separons pas.

Ne crains plus tant ces jours de courses vaines
Ou notre destin fut pareil;
Ces jours meles de plaisirs et de peines,
Meles de pluie et de soleil.
Je dois bientot, il me le semble,
Mettre pour jamais habit bas.
Attends un peu; nous finirons ensemble:
Mon vieil ami, ne nous separons pas.


LES ETOILES QUI FILENT

Berger, tu dis que notre etoile
Regle nos jours et brille aux cieux.
--Oui, mon enfant; mais dans son voile
La nuit la derobe a nos yeux.
--Berger, sur cet azur tranquille
De lire on te croit le secret:
Quelle est cette etoile qui file,
Qui file, file, et disparait?

--Mon enfant, un mortel expire;
Son etoile tombe a l'instant.
Entre amis que la joie inspire,
Celui-ci buvait en chantant.
Heureux, il s'endort immobile
Aupres du vin qu'il celebrait....
--Encore une etoile qui file,
Qui file, file, et disparait.

--Mon enfant, qu'elle est pure et belle!
C'est celle d'un objet charmant:
Fille heureuse, amante fidele,
On l'accorde au plus tendre amant.
Des fleurs ceignent son front nubile,
Et de l'hymen l'autel est pret....
--Encore une etoile qui file,
Qui file, file, et disparait.

--Mon fils, c'est l'etoile rapide
D'un tres grand seigneur nouveau-ne.
Le berceau qu'il a laisse vide
D'or et de pourpre etait orne.
Des poisons qu'un flatteur distille
C'etait a qui le nourrirait....
--Encore une etoile qui file,
Qui file, file, et disparait.

--Mon enfant, quel eclair sinistre!
C'etait l'astre d'un favori
Qui se croyait un grand ministre
Quand de nos maux il avait ri.
Ceux qui servaient ce dieu fragile
Ont deja cache son portrait....
--Encore une etoile qui file,
Qui file, file, et disparait.

--Mon fils, quels pleurs seront les notres!
D'un riche nous perdons l'appui.
L'indigence glane chez d'autres,
Mais elle moissonnait chez lui.
Ce soir meme, sur d'un asile,
A son toit le pauvre accourait....
--Encore une etoile qui file,
Qui file, file, et disparait.

--C'est celle d'un puissant monarque!....
Va, mon fils, garde ta candeur,
Et que ton etoile ne marque
Par l'eclat ni par la grandeur.
Si tu brillais sans etre utile,
A ton dernier jour on dirait:
Ce n'est qu'une etoile qui file,
Qui file, file, et disparait.


LES SOUVENIRS DU PEUPLE

On parlera de sa gloire
Sous le chaume bien longtemps,
L'humble toit, dans cinquante ans,
Ne connaitra plus d'autre histoire.
La viendront les villageois
Dire alors a quelque vieille:
Par des recits d'autrefois,
Mere, abregez notre veille.
Bien, dit-on, qu'il nous ait nui,
Le peuple encor le revere,
    Oui, le revere.
Parlez-nous de lui, grand'mere,
    Parlez-nous de lui.

Mes enfants, dans ce village,
Suivi de rois, il passa.
Voila bien longtemps de ca:
Je venais d'entrer en menage.
A pied grimpant le coteau
Ou pour voir je m'etais mise,
Il avait petit chapeau
Avec redingote grise.
Pres de lui je me troublai;
Il me dit: Bonjour, ma chere,
  Bonjour, ma chere.
--Il vous a parle, grand'mere!
  Il vous a parle!

L'an d'apres, moi, pauvre femme,
A Paris etant un jour,
Je le vis avec sa cour:

Il se rendait a Notre-Dame.
Tous les coeurs etaient contents;
On admirait son cortege.
Chacun disait: Quel beau temps!
Le ciel toujours le protege.
Son sourire etait bien doux;
D'un fils Dieu le rendait pere,
    Le rendait pere.
--Quel beau jour pour vous, grand'mere!
    Quel beau jour pour vous!

Mais quand la pauvre Champagne
Fut en proie aux etrangers,
Lui, bravant tous les dangers,
Semblait seul tenir la campagne.
Un soir, tout comme aujourd'hui,
J'entends frapper a la porte;
J'ouvre.  Bon Dieu! c'etait lui,
Suivi d'une faible escorte.
Il s'assoit ou me voila,
S'ecriant: Oh! quelle guerre!
    Oh! quelle guerre!
--Il s'est assis la, grand'mere!
    Il s'est assis la!


J'ai faim, dit-il; et bien vite
Je sers piquette et pain bis;
Puis il seche ses habits,
Meme a dormir le feu l'invite.
Au reveil, voyant mes pleurs,
Il me dit: Bonne esperance!
Je cours de tous ses malheurs
Sous Paris venger la France.
Il part; et, comme un tresor,
J'ai depuis garde son verre,
    Garde son verre.
--Vous l'avez encor, grand'mere!
    Vous l'avez encor !

Le voici. Mais a sa perte
Le heros fut entraine.
Lui, qu'un pape a couronne,
Est mort dans une ile deserte.
Longtemps aucun ne l'a cru;
On disait: Il va paraitre.
Par mer il est accouru;
L'etranger va voir son maitre.
Quand d'erreur on nous tira,
Ma douleur fut bien amere!
    Fut bien amere!
--Dieu vous benira, grand'mere,
    Dieu vous benira.


LES FOUS

Vieux soldats de plomb que nous sommes,
Au cordeau nous alignant tous,
Si des rangs sortent quelques hommes,
Tous nous crions: A bas les fous!
On les persecute, on les tue,
Sauf, apres un lent examen,
A leur dresser une statue
Pour la gloire du genre humain.

Combien de temps une pensee,
Vierge obscure, attend son epoux!
Les sots la traitent d'insensee;
Le sage lui dit: Cachez-vous.
Mais, la rencontrant loin du monde,
Un fou qui croit au lendemain
L'epouse; elle devient feconde
Pour le bonheur du genre humain.

J'ai vu Saint-Simon le prophete,
Riche d'abord, puis endette,
Qui des fondements jusqu'au faite
Refaisait la societe.
Plein de son oeuvre commencee,
Vieux, pour elle il tendait la main,
Sur qu'il embrassait la pensee
Qui doit sauver le genre humain.

Fourier nous dit: Sors de la fange,
Peuple en proie aux deceptions.
Travaille, groupe par phalange,
Dans un cercle d'attractions.
La terre, apres tant de desastres,
Forme avec le ciel un hymen,
Et la loi qui regit les astres
Donne la paix au genre humain!

Enfantin affranchit la femme,
L'appelle a partager nos droits.
Fi! dites-vous; sous l'epigramme
Ces fous reveurs tombent tous trois.
Messieurs, lorsqu'en vain notre sphere
Du bonheur cherche le chemin,
Honneur au fou qui ferait faire
Un reve heureux au genre humain!

Qui decouvrit un nouveau monde?
Un fou qu'on raillait en tout lieu.
Sur la croix que son sang inonde
Un fou qui meurt nous legue un Dieu,
Si demain, oubliant d'eclore,
Le jour manquait, eh bien! demain
Quelque fou trouverait encore
Un flambeau pour le genre humain.




MILLEVOYE


LA CHUTE DES FEUILLES

De la depouille de nos bois
L'automne avait jonche la terre;
Le bocage etait sans mystere,
Le rossignol etait sans voix.
Triste et mourant a son aurore
Un jeune malade, a pas lents,
Parcourait une fois encore
Le bois cher a ses premiers ans.

"Bois que j'aime, adieu! je succombe:
Votre deuil me predit mon sort,
Et dans chaque feuille qui tombe
Je lis un presage de mort!
Fatal oracle d'Epidaure,
Tu m'as dit: 'Les feuilles des bois
A tes yeux jauniront encore,
Et c'est pour la derniere fois.
La nuit du trepas t'environne;
Plus pale que la pale automne,
Tu t'inclines vers le tombeau.

Ta jeunesse sera fletrie
Avant l'herbe de la prairie,
Avant le pampre du coteau.'
Et je meurs! De sa froide baleine
Un vent funeste m'a touche,
Et mon hiver s'est approche
Quand mon printemps s'ecoule a peine.
Arbuste en un seul jour detruit,
Quelques fleurs faisaient ma parure;
Mais ma languissante verdure
Ne laisse apres elle aucun fruit.
Tombe, tombe, feuille ephemere,
Voile aux yeux ce triste chemin,
Cache au desespoir de ma mere
La place ou je serai demain!
Mais vers la solitaire allee
Si mon amante desolee
Venait pleurer quand le jour fuit,
Eveille par un leger bruit
Mon ombre un moment consolee."

Il dit, s'eloigne ... et sans retour!
La derniere feuille qui tombe
A signale son dernier jour.
Sous le chene on creusa sa tombe.
Mais son amante ne vint pas
Visiter la pierre isolee;
Et le patre de la vallee
Troubla seul du bruit de ses pas
Le silence du mausolee.




MADAME DESBORDES-VALMORE


S'IL L'AVAIT SU

S'Il avait su quelle ame il a blessee,
Larmes du coeur, s'il avait pu vous voir,
Ah! si ce coeur, trop plein de sa pensee,
De l'exprimer eut garde le pouvoir,
Changer ainsi n'eut pas ete possible;
Fier de nourrir l'espoir qu'il a decu,
A tant d'amour il eut ete sensible,
         S'il l'avait su.

S'il avait su tout ce qu'on peut attendre
D'une ame simple, ardente et sans detour,
Il eut voulu la mienne pour l'entendre.
Comme il l'inspire, il eut connu l'amour.
Mes yeux baisses recelaient cette flamme;
Dans leur pudeur n'a-t-il rien apercu?
Un tel secret valait toute son ame,
         S'il l'avait su.

Si j'avais su, moi-meme, a quel empire
On s'abandonne en regardant ses yeux,
Sans le chercher comme l'air qu'on respire
J'aurais porte mes jours sous d'autres cieux
Il est trop tard pour renouer ma vie;
Ma vie etait un doux espoir decu:
Diras-tu pas, toi qui me l'as ravie,
         Si j'avais su?


LES ROSES DE SAADI

J'ai voulu ce matin te rapporter des roses;
Mais j'en avais tant pris dans mes ceintures closes
Que les noeuds trop serres n'ont pu les contenir.

Les noeuds ont eclate. Les roses, envolees
Dans le vent, a la mer s'en sont toutes allees.
Elles ont suivi l'eau pour ne plus revenir.

La vague en a paru rouge et comme enflammee.
Ce soir, ma robe encore en est tout embaumee....
Respires-en sur moi l'odorant souvenir!


LE PREMIER AMOUR

Vous souvient-il de cette jeune amie,
Au regard tendre, au maintien sage et doux?
A peine, helas! au printemps de sa vie,
Son coeur sentit qu'il etait fait pour vous.

Point de serment, point de vaine promesse:
Si jeune encore, on ne les connait pas;
Son ame pure aimait avec ivresse,
Et se livrait sans honte et sans combats.

Elle a perdu son idole cherie;
Bonheur si doux a dure moins qu'un jour!
Elle n'est plus au printemps de sa vie:
Elle est encore a son premier amour.




LAMARTINE


LE LAC

Ainsi, toujours pousses vers de nouveaux rivages,
Dans la nuit eternelle emportes sans retour,
Ne pourrons-nous jamais sur l'ocean des ages
       Jeter l'ancre un seul jour?

O lac! l'annee a peine a fini sa carriere,
Et pres des flots cheris qu'elle devait revoir,
Regarde! je viens seul m'asseoir sur cette pierre
       Ou tu la vis s'asseoir!

Tu mugissais ainsi sous ces roches profondes;
Ainsi tu te brisais sur leurs flancs dechires;
Ainsi le vent jetait l'ecume de tes ondes
       Sur ses pieds adores.

Un soir, t'en souvient-il? nous voguions en silence,
On n'entendait au loin, sur l'onde et sous les cieux,
Que le bruit des rameurs qui frappaient en cadence
       Tes flots harmonieux.

Tout a coup des accents inconnus a la terre
Du rivage charme frapperent les echos;
Le flot fut attentif, et la voix qui m'est chere
       Laissa tomber ces mots:

"O temps, suspends ton vol! et vous, heures propices
       Suspendez votre cours!
Laissez-nous savourer les rapides delices
       Des plus beaux de nos jours!

"Assez de malheureux ici-bas vous implorent:
       Coulez, coulez pour eux;
Prenez avec leurs jours les soins qui les devorent;
       Oubliez les heureux.

"Mais je demande en vain quelques moments encore,
       Le temps m'echappe et fuit;
Je dis a cette nuit: Sois plus lente; et l'aurore
       Va dissiper la nuit.

"Aimons donc, aimons donc! de l'heure fugitive,
       Hatons-nous, jouissons!
L'homme n'a point de port, le temps n'a point de rive;
       Il coule, et nous passons!"

Temps jaloux, se peut-il que ces moments d'ivresse,
Ou l'amour a longs flots nous verse le bonheur,
S'envolent loin de nous de la meme vitesse
       Que les jours de malheur ?

Eh quoi! n'en pourrons-nous fixer au moins la trace?
Quoi! passes pour jamais? quoi! tout entiers perdus?
Ce temps qui les donna, ce temps qui les efface,
       Ne nous les rendra plus?

Eternite, neant, passe, sombres abimes,
Que faites-vous des jours que vous engloutissez?
Parlez: nous rendrez-vous ces extases sublimes
       Que vous nous ravissez?

O lac! rochers muets! grottes! foret obscure!
Vous que le temps epargne ou qu'il peut rajeunir,
Gardez de cette nuit, gardez, belle nature,
       Au moins le souvenir!

Qu'il soit dans ton repos, qu'il soif dans tes orages,
Beau lac, et dans l'aspect de tes riants coteaux,
Et dans ces noirs sapins, et dans ces rocs sauvages
       Qui pendent sur tes eaux!

Qu'il soit dans le zephyr qui fremit et qui passe,
Dans les bruits de tes bords par tes bords repetes,
Dans l'astre au front d'argent qui blanchit ta surface
       De ses molles clartes!

Que le vent qui gemit, le roseau qui soupire,
Que les parfums legers de ton air embaume,
Que tout ce qu'on entend, l'on voit ou l'on respire,
       Tout dise: "Ils ont aime!"


L'AUTOMNE

Salut, bois couronnes d'un reste de verdure!
Feuillages jaunissants sur les gazons epars!
Salut, derniers beaux jours! Le deuil de la nature
Convient a la douleur et plait a mes regards.

Je suis d'un pas reveur le sentier solitaire;
J'aime a revoir encor, pour la derniere fois,
Ce soleil palissant, dont la faible lumiere
Perce a peine a mes pieds l'obscurite des bois.

Oui, dans ces jours d'automne ou la nature expire,
A ses regards voiles je trouve plus d'attraits:
C'est l'adieu d'un ami, c'est le dernier sourire
Des levres que la mort va fermer pour jamais.

Ainsi, pret a quitter l'horizon de la vie,
Pleurant de mes longs jours l'espoir evanoui,
Je me retourne encore et d'un regard d'envie
Je contemple ces biens dont je n'ai pas joui.

Terre, soleil, vallons, belle et douce nature,
Je vous dois une larme au bord de mon tombeau,
L'air est si parfume! la lumiere est si pure!
Aux regards d'un mourant le soleil est si beau!

Je voudrais maintenant vider jusqu'a la lie
Ce calice mele de nectar et de fiel:
Au fond de cette coupe ou je buvais la vie,
Peut-etre restait-il une goutte de miel!

Peut-etre l'avenir me gardait-il encore
Un retour de bonheur dont l'espoir est perdu!
Peut-etre, dans la foule, une ame que j'ignore
Aurait compris mon ame, et m'aurait repondu?....

La fleur tombe en livrant ses parfums au zephire;
A la vie, au soleil, ce sont la ses adieux;
Moi, je meurs; et mon ame, au moment qu'elle expire,
S'exhale comme un son triste et melodieux.


LE SOIR

Le soir ramene le silence.
Assis sur ces rochers deserts,
Je suis dans le vague des airs
Le char de la nuit qui s'avance.

Venus se leve a l'horizon;
A mes pieds l'etoile amoureuse
De sa lueur mysterieuse
Blanchit les tapis de gazon.

De ce hetre au feuillage sombre
J'entends frissonner les rameaux;
On dirait autour des tombeaux
Qu'on entend voltiger une ombre.

Tout a coup, detache des cieux,
Un rayon de l'astre nocturne,
Glissant sur mon front taciturne,
Vient mollement toucher mes yeux.

Doux reflet d'un globe de flamme,
Charmant rayon, que me veux-tu?
Viens-tu dans mon sein abattu
Porter la lumiere a mon ame?

Descends-tu pour me reveler
Des mondes le divin mystere,
Ces secrets caches dans la sphere
Ou le jour va te rappeler!

Une secrete intelligence
T'adresse-t-elle aux malheureux?
Viens-tu, la nuit, briller sur eux
Comme un rayon de l'esperance?

Viens-tu devoiler l'avenir
Au coeur fatigue qui l'implore?
Rayon divin, es-tu l'aurore
Du jour qui ne doit pas finir?

Mon coeur a ta clarte s'enflamme,
Je sens des transports inconnus,
Je songe a ceux qui ne sont plus:
Douce lumiere, es-tu leur ame?

Peut-etre ces manes heureux
Glissent ainsi sur le bocage.
Enveloppe de leur image,
Je crois me sentir plus pres d'eux!

Ah! si c'est vous, ombres cheries,
Loin de la foule et loin du bruit,
Revenez ainsi chaque nuit
Vous meler a mes reveries.

Ramenez la paix et l'amour
Au sein de mon ame epuisee,
Comme la nocturne rosee
Qui tombe apres les feux du jour.

Venez! ... Mais des vapeurs funebres
Montent des bords de l'horizon:
Elles voilent le doux rayon,
Et tout rentre dans les tenebres.



LE VALLON

Mon coeur, lasse de tout, meme de l'esperance,
N'ira plus de ses voeux importuner le sort;
Pretez-moi seulement, vallon de mon enfance,
Un asile d'un jour pour attendre la mort.

Voici l'etroit sentier de l'obscure vallee:
Du flanc de ces coteaux pendent des bois epais
Qui, courbant sur mon front leur ombre entremelee,
Me couvrent tout entier de silence et de paix.

La, deux ruisseaux caches sous des ponts de verdure
Tracent en serpentant les contours du vallon;
Ils melent un moment leur onde et leur murmure,
Et non loin de leur source ils se perdent sans nom.

La source de mes jours comme eux s'est ecoulee;
Elle a passe sans bruit, sans nom et sans retour:
Mais leur onde est limpide, et mon ame troublee
N'aura pas reflechi les clartes d'un beau jour.

La fraicheur de leurs lits, l'ombre qui les couronne,
M'enchainent tout le jour sur les bords des ruisseaux;
Comme un enfant berce par un chant monotone,
Mon ame s'assoupit au murmure des eaux.

Ah! c'est la qu'entoure d'un rempart de verdure,
D'un horizon borne qui suffit a mes yeux,
J'aime a fixer mes pas, et, seul dans la nature,
An'entendre que l'onde, a ne voir que les cieux.

J'ai trop vu, trop senti, trop aime dans ma vie;
Je viens chercher vivant le calme du Lethe.
Beaux lieux, soyez pour moi ces bords ou l'on oublie:
L'oubli seul desormais est ma felicite.

Mon coeur est en repos, mon ame est en silence;
Le bruit lointain du monde expire en arrivant,
Comme un son eloigne qu'affaiblit la distance,
A l'oreille incertaine apporte par le vent.

D'ici je vois la vie, a travers un nuage,
S'evanouir pour moi dans l'ombre du passe;
L'amour seul est reste, comme une grande image
Survit seule au reveil dans un songe efface.

Repose-toi, mon ame, en ce dernier asile,
Ainsi qu'un voyageur qui, le coeur plein d'espoir,
S'assied, avant d'entrer, aux portes de la ville,
Et respire un moment l'air embaume du soir.

Comme lui, de nos pieds secouons la poussiere;
L'homme par ce chemin ne repasse jamais:
Comme lui, respirons au bout de la carriere
Ce calme avant-coureur de l'eternelle paix.

Tes jours, sombres et courts comme les jours d'automne,
Declinent comme l'ombre au penchant des coteaux;
L'amitie te trahit, la pitie t'abandonne,
Et, seule, tu descends le sentier des tombeaux.

Mais la nature est la qui t'invite et qui t'aime;
Plonge-toi dans son sein qu'elle t'ouvre toujours:
Quand tout change pour toi, la nature est la meme,
Et le meme soleil se leve sur tes jours.

De lumiere et d'ombrage elle t'entoure encore;
Detache ton amour des faux biens que tu perds;
Adore ici l'echo qu'adorait Pythagore,
Prete avec lui l'oreille aux celestes concerts.

Suis le jour dans le ciel, suis l'ombre sur la terre;
Dans les plaines de l'air vole avec l'aquilon;
Avec le doux rayon de l'astre du mystere
Glisse a travers les bois dans l'ombre du vallon.

Dieu, pour le concevoir, a fait l'intelligence:
Sous la nature enfin decouvre son auteur!
Une voix a l'esprit parle dans son silence:
Qui n'a pas entendu cette voix dans son coeur?


L'ISOLEMENT

Souvent sur la montagne, a l'ombre du vieux chene,
Au coucher du soleil, tristement je m'assieds;
Je promene au hasard mes regards sur la plaine,
Dont le tableau changeant se deroule a mes pieds.

Ici gronde le fleuve aux vagues ecumantes;
Il serpente, et s'enfonce en un lointain obscur;
La le lac immobile etend ses eaux dormantes
Ou l'etoile du soir se leve dans l'azur.

Au sommet de ces monts couronnes de bois sombres,
Le crepuscule encor jette un dernier rayon;
Et le char vaporeux de la reine des ombres
Monte, et blanchit deja les bords de l'horizon.

Cependant, s'elancant de la fleche gothique,
Un son religieux se repand dans les airs:
Le voyageur s'arrete, et la cloche rustique
Aux derniers bruits du jour mele de saints concerts.

Mais a ces doux tableaux mon ame indifferente
N'eprouve devant eux ni charme ni transports;
Je contemple la terre ainsi qu'une ombre errante:
Le soleil des vivants n'echauffe plus les morts.

De colline en colline en vain portant ma vue,
Du sud a l'aquilon, de l'aurore au couchant,
Je parcours tous les points de l'immense etendue,
Et je dis: "Nulle part le bonheur ne m'attend."

Que me font ces vallons, ces palais, ces chaumieres,
Vains objets dont pour moi le charme est envole?
Fleuves, rochers, forets, solitudes si cheres,
Un seul etre vous manque, et tout est depeuple!

Que le tour du soleil ou commence ou s'acheve,
D'un oeil indifferent je le suis dans son cours;
En un ciel sombre ou pur qu'il se couche ou se leve,
Qu'importe le soleil? je n'attends rien des jours.

Quand je pourrais le suivre en sa vaste carriere,
Mes yeux verraient partout le vide et les deserts:
Je ne desire rien de tout ce qu'il eclaire;
Je ne demande rien a l'immense univers.

Mais peut-etre au dela des bornes de sa sphere,
Lieux ou le vrai soleil eclaire d'autres cieux,
Si je pouvais laisser ma depouille a la terre,
Ce que j'ai tant reve paraitrait a mes yeux!

La, je m'enivrerais a la source ou j'aspire;
La, je retrouverais et l'espoir et l'amour,
Et ce bien ideal que toute ame desire,
Et qui n'a pas de nom au terrestre sejour!

Que ne puis-je, porte sur le char de l'Aurore,
Vague objet de mes voeux, m'elancer jusqu'a toi!
Sur la terre d'exil pourquoi reste-je encore?
Il n'est rien de commun entre la terre et moi.

Quand la feuille des bois tombe dans la prairie,
Le vent du soir s'eleve et l'arrache aux vallons;
Et moi, je suis semblable a la feuille fletrie:
Emportez-moi comme elle, orageux aquilons!


LE CRUCIFIX

Toi que j'ai recueilli sur sa bouche expirante
Avec son dernier souffle et son dernier adieu,
Symbole deux fois saint, don d'une main mourante,
       Image de mon Dieu;

Que de pleurs ont coule sur tes pieds que j'adore,
Depuis l'heure sacree ou, du sein d'un martyr,
Dans mes tremblantes mains tu passas, tiede encore
       De son dernier soupir!

Les saints flambeaux jetaient une derniere flamme;
Le pretre murmurait ces doux chants de la mort,
Pareils aux chants plaintifs que murmure une femme
       A l'enfant qui s'endort.

De son pieux espoir son front gardait la trace,
Et sur ses traits, frappes d'une auguste beaute,
La douleur fugitive avait empreint sa grace,
       La mort sa majeste.

Le vent qui caressait sa tete echevelee
Me montrait tour a tour ou me voilait ses traits,
Comme l'on voit flotter sur un blanc mausolee
       L'ombre des noirs cypres.

Un de ses bras pendait de la funebre couche;
L'autre, languissamment replie sur son coeur,
Semblait chercher encore et presser sur sa bouche
       L'image du Sauveur.

Ses levres s'entr'ouvraient pour l'embrasser encore
Mais son ame avait fui dans ce divin baiser,
Comme un leger parfum que la flamme devore
       Avant de l'embraser.

Maintenant tout dormait sur sa bouche glacee,
Le souffle se taisait dans son sein endormi,
Et sur l'oeil sans regard la paupiere affaissee
       Retombait a demi.

Et moi, debout, saisi d'une terreur secrete,
Je n'osais m'approcher de ce reste adore,
Comme si du trepas la majeste muette
       L'eut deja consacre.

Je n'osais !... Mais le pretre entendit mon silence,
Et, de ses doigts glaces prenant le crucifix :
"Voila le souvenir, et voila l'esperance :
       Emportez-les, mon fils!"

Oui, tu me resteras, o funebre heritage!
Sept fois, depuis ce jour, l'arbre que j'ai plante
Sur sa tombe sans nom a change de feuillage :
       Tu ne m'as pas quitte.

Place pres de ce coeur, helas! ou tout s'efface,
Tu l'as contre le temps defendu de l'oubli,
Et mes yeux goutte a goutte ont imprime leur trace
       Sur l'ivoire amolli.

O dernier confident de l'ame qui s'envole,
Viens, reste sur mon coeur ! parle encore, et dis-moi
Ce qu'elle te disait quand sa faible parole
       N'arrivait plus qu'a toi ;

A cette heure douteuse ou l'ame recueillie,
Se cachant sous le voile epaissi sur nos yeux,
Hors de nos sens glaces pas a pas se replie,
       Sourde aux derniers adieux ;

Alors qu'entre la vie et la mort incertaine,
Comme un fruit par son poids detache du rameau,
Notre ame est suspendue et tremble a chaque halein
       Sur la nuit du tombeau ;

Quand des chants, des sanglots la confuse harmonie
N'eveille deja plus notre esprit endormi,
Aux levres du mourant colle dans l'agonie,
       Comme un dernier ami :

Pour eclairer l'horreur de cet etroit passage,
Pour relever vers Dieu son regard abattu,
Divin consolateur, dont nous baisons l'image,
       Reponds, que lui dis-tu ?

Tu sais, tu sais mourir! et tes larmes divines,
Dans cette nuit terrible ou tu prias en vain,
De l'olivier sacre baignerent les racines
       Du soir jusqu'au matin.

De la croix, ou ton oeil sonda ce grand mystere
Tu vis ta mere en pleurs et la nature en deuil;
Tu laissas comme nous tes amis sur la terre,
       Et ton corps au cercueil!

Au nom de cette mort, que ma faiblesse obtienne
De rendre sur ton sein ce douloureux soupir:
Quand mon heure viendra, souviens-toi de la tienne,
       O toi qui sais mourir!

Je chercherai la place ou sa bouche expirante
Exhala sur tes pieds l'irrevocable adieu,
Et son ame viendra guider mon ame errante
       Au sein du meme Dieu.

Ah! puisse, puisse alors sur ma funebre couche,
Triste et calme a la fois, comme un ange eplore,
Une figure en deuil recueillir sur ma bouche
       L'heritage sacre !

Soutiens ses derniers pas, charme sa derniere heure;
Et, gage consacre d'esperance et d'amour,
De celui qui s'eloigne a celui qui demeure
       Passe ainsi tour a tour,

Jusqu'au jour ou, des morts percant la voute sombre
Une voix dans le ciel, les appelant sept fois,
Ensemble eveillera ceux qui dorment a l'ombre
       De l'eternelle croix !


ADIEU A GRAZIELLA

Adieu! mot qu'une larme humecte sur la levre ;
Mot qui finit la joie et qui tranche l'amour ;
Mot par qui le depart de delices nous sevre ;
Mot que l'eternite doit effacer un jour!

Adieu!.... Je t'ai souvent prononce dans ma vie,
Sans comprendre, en quittant les etres que j'aimais,
Ce que tu contenais de tristesse et de lie,
Quand l'homme dit: "Retour!" et que Dieu dit :

       "Jamais!"

Mais aujourd'hui je sens que ma bouche prononce
Le mot qui contient tout, puisqu'il est plein de toi,
Qui tombe dans l'abime, et qui n'a pour reponse
Que l'eternel silence entre une image et moi!

Et cependant mon coeur redit a chaque haleine
Ce mot qu'un sourd sanglot entrecoupe au milieu,
Comme si tous les sons dont la nature est pleine
N'avaient pour sens unique, helas ! qu'un grand adieu !


LES PRELUDES

O vallons paternels; doux champs; humble chaumiere
Au bord penchant des bois suspendue aux coteaux,
Dont l'humble toit, cache sous des touffes de lierre,
         Ressemble au nid sous les rameaux;

Gazons entrecoupes de ruisseaux et d'ombrages;
Seuil antique ou mon pere, adore comme un roi,
Comptait ses gras troupeaux rentrant des paturages,
         Ouvrez-vous, ouvrez-vous! c'est moi!

Voila du dieu des champs la rustique demeure.
J'entends l'airain fremir au sommet de ses tours;
Il semble que dans l'air une voix qui me pleure
         Me rappelle a mes premiers jours.

Oui, je reviens a toi, berceau de mon enfance,
Embrasser pour jamais tes foyers protecteurs.
Loin de moi les cites et leur vaine opulence!
         Je suis ne parmi les pasteurs.

Enfant, j'aimais comme eux a suivre dans la plaine
Les agneaux pas a pas, egares jusqu'au soir;
A revenir comme eux baigner leur blanche laine
         Dans l'eau courante du lavoir;

J'aimais a me suspendre aux lianes legeres,
A gravir dans les airs de rameaux en rameaux,
Pour ravir, le premier, sous l'aile de leurs meres,
         Les tendres oeufs des tourtereaux;

J'aimais les voix du soir dans les airs repandues,
Le bruit lointain des chars gemissant sous leur poids,
Et le sourd tintement des cloches suspendues
         Au cou des chevreaux dans les bois.

Et depuis, exile de ces douces retraites,
Comme un vase impregne d'une premiere odeur,
Toujours, loin des cites, des voluptes secretes
         Entrainaient mes yeux et mon coeur.

Beaux lieux, recevez-moi sous vos sacres ombrages !
Vous qui couvrez le seuil de rameaux eplores,
Saules contemporains, courbez vos longs feuillages
         Sur le frere que vous pleurez.

Reconnaissez mes pas, doux gazons que je foule,
Arbres que dans mes jeux j'insultais autrefois;
Et toi qui loin de moi te cachais a la foule,
         Triste echo, reponds a ma voix.

Je ne viens pas trainer, dans vos riants asiles,
Les regrets du passe, les songes du futur:
J'y viens vivre, et, couche sous vos berceaux fertiles,
         Abriter mon repos obscur.

S'eveiller, le coeur pur, au reveil de l'aurore,
Pour benir, au matin, le Dieu qui fait le jour;
Voir les fleurs du vallon sous la rosee eclore,
         Comme pour feter son retour;

Respirer les parfums que la colline exhale,
Ou l'humide fraicheur qui tombe des forets;
Voir onduler de loin l'haleine matinale
         Sur le sein flottant des guerets;

Conduire la genisse a la source qu'elle aime,
Ou suspendre la chevre au cytise embaume,
Ou voir ses blancs taureaux venir tendre d'eux-meme
         Leur front au joug accoutume ;

Guider un soc tremblant dans le sillon qui crie,
Du pampre domestique emonder les berceaux,
Ou creuser mollement, au sein de la prairie,
         Les lits murmurants des ruisseaux;

Le soir, assis en paix au seuil de la chaumiere,
Tendre au pauvre qui passe un morceau de son pain,
Et, fatigue du jour, y fermer sa paupiere
         Loin des soucis du lendemain;

Sentir, sans les compter, dans leur ordre paisible,
Les jours suivre les jours, sans faire plus de bruit
Que ce sable leger dont la fuite insensible
         Nous marque l'heure qui s'enfuit;

Voir de vos doux vergers sur vos fronts les fruits pendre,
Les fruits d'un chaste amour dans vos bras accourir,
Et, sur eux appuye, doucement redescendre:
         C'est assez pour qui doit mourir.


HYMNE DE L'ENFANT A SON REVEIL

O pere qu'adore mon pere!
Toi qu'on ne nomme qu'a genoux!
Toi, dont le nom terrible et doux
Fait courber le front de ma mere!

On dit que ce brillant soleil
N'est qu'un jouet de ta puissance;
Que sous tes pieds il se balance
Comme une lampe de vermeil.

On dit que c'est toi qui fais naitre
Les petits oiseaux, dans les champs,
Et qui donne aux petits enfants
Une ame aussi pour te connaitre!

On dit que c'est toi qui produis
Les fleurs dont le jardin se pare,
Et que, sans toi, toujours avare,
Le verger n'aurait point de fruits.

Aux dons que ta bonte mesure
Tout l'univers est convie;
Nul insecte n'est oublie
A ce festin de la nature.

L'agneau broute le serpolet,
La chevre s'attache au cytise,
La mouche au bord du vase puise
Les blanches gouttes de mon lait!

L'alouette a la graine amere
Que laisse envoler le glaneur,
Le passereau suit le vanneur,
Et l'enfant s'attache a sa mere.

Et pour obtenir chaque don
Que chaque jour tu fais eclore,
A midi, le soir, a l'aurore,
Que faut-il? prononcer ton nom!

O Dieu! ma bouche balbutie
Ce nom des anges redoute.
Un enfant meme est ecoute
Dans le choeur qui te glorifie!

On dit qu'il aime a recevoir
Les voeux presentes par l'enfance,
A cause de cette innocence
Que nous avons sans le savoir.

On dit que leurs humbles louanges
A son oreille montent mieux;
Que les anges peuplent les cieux,
Et que nous ressemblons aux anges!

Ah! puisqu'il entend de si loin
Les voeux que notre bouche adresse,
Je veux lui demander sans cesse
Ce dont les autres ont besoin.

Mon Dieu, donne l'onde aux fontaines,
Donne la plume aux passereaux,
Et la laine aux petits agneaux,
Et l'ombre et la rosee aux plaines.

Donne au malade la sante,
Au mendiant le pain qu'il pleure,
A l'orphelin une demeure,
Au prisonnier la liberte.

Donne une famille nombreuse
Au pere qui craint le Seigneur,
Donne a moi sagesse et bonheur,
Pour que ma mere soit heureuse!

Que je sois bon, quoique petit,
Comme cet enfant dans le temple,
Que chaque matin je contemple
Souriant au pied de mon lit.

Mets dans mon ame la justice,
Sur mes levres la verite,
Qu'avec crainte et docilit
Ta parole en mon coeur murisse!

Et que ma voix s'eleve a toi
Comme cette douce fumee
Que balance l'urne embaumee
Dans la main d'enfants comme moi!



LE PREMIER REGRET

Sur la plage sonore ou la mer de Sorrente
Deroule ses flots bleus, aux pieds de l'oranger,
Il est, pres du sentier, sous la haie odorante,
Une pierre, petite, etroite, indifferente
      Aux pas distraits de l'etranger.

La giroflee y cache un seul nom sous ses gerbes,
Un nom que nul echo n'a jamais repete.
Quelquefois seulement le passant arrete,
Lisant l'age et la date en ecartant les herbes
Et sentant dans ses yeux quelques larmes courir,
Dit: "Elle avait seize ans; c'est bien tot pour mourir!"

Mais pourquoi m'entrainer vers ces scenes passees ?
Laissons le vent gemir et le flot murmurer.
Revenez, revenez, o mes tristes pensees!
      Je veux rever, et non pleurer.

Dit: "Elle avait seize ans!" Oui, seize ans! et cet age
N'avait jamais brille sur un front plus charmant,
Et jamais tout l'eclat de ce brulant rivage
Ne s'etait reflechi dans un oeil plus aimant!
Moi seul je la revois, telle que la pensee
Dans l'ame, ou rien ne meurt, vivante l'a laissee,
Vivante comme a l'heure ou, les yeux sur les miens,
Prolongeant sur la mer nos premiers entretiens,
Ses cheveux noirs livres au vent qui les denoue,
Et l'ombre de la voile errante sur sa joue,
Elle ecoutait le chant du nocturne pecheur,
De la brise embaumee aspirait la fraicheur,
Me montrait dans le ciel la lune epanouie
Comme une fleur des nuits dont l'aube est rejouie,
Et l'ecume argentee, et me disait : " Pourquoi
Tout brille-t-il ainsi dans les airs et dans moi ?
Jamais ces champs d'azur semes de tant de flammes,
Jamais ces sables d'or ou vont mourir les lames,
Ces monts dont les sommets tremblent au fond des cieux,
Ces golfes couronnes de bois silencieux,
Ces lueurs sur la cote, et ces chants sur les vagues,
N'avaient emu mes sens de voluptes si vagues!
Pourquoi comme ce soir n'ai-je jamais reve ?
Un astre dans mon coeur s'est-il aussi leve ?
Et toi, fils du matin, dis! a ces nuits si belles
Les nuits de ton pays, sans moi, ressemblaient-elles?"
Puis, regardant sa mere assise aupres de nous,
Posait pour s'endormir son front sur ses genoux.

Mais pourquoi m'entrainer vers ces scenes passees?
Laissons le vent gemir et le flot murmurer.
Revenez, revenez, o mes tristes pensees!
     Je veux rever, et non pleurer.

Que son oeil etait pur, et sa levre candide!
Que son ciel inondait son ame de clarte!
Le beau lac de Nemi, qu'aucun souffle ne ride,
A moins de transparence et de limpidite.
Dans cette ame, avant elle, on voyait ses pensees;
Ses paupieres jamais, sur ses beaux yeux baissees,
Ne voilaient son regard d'innocence rempli;
Nul souci sur son front n'avait laisse son pli;
Tout folatrait en elle: et ce jeune sourire,
Qui plus tard sur la bouche avec tristesse expire,
Sur sa levre entr'ouverte etait toujours flottant,
Comme un pur arc-en-ciel sur un jour eclatant.
Nulle ombre ne voilait ce ravissant visage,
Ce rayon n'avait pas traverse de nuage.
Son pas insouciant, indecis, balance,
Flottait comme un flot libre ou le jour est berce,
Ou courait pour courir; et sa voix argentine,
Echo limpide et pur de son ame enfantine,
Musique de cette ame ou tout semblait chanter,
Egayait jusqu'a l'air qui l'entendait monter.

Mais pourquoi m'entrainer vers ces scenes passees?
Laissons le vent gemir et le flot murmurer.
Revenez, revenez, o mes tristes pensees!
     Je veux rever, et non pleurer.

Mon image en son coeur se grava la premiere,
Comme dans l'oeil qui s'ouvre, au matin, la lumiere;
Elle ne regarda plus rien apres ce jour:
De l'heure qu'elle aima, l'univers fut amour!
Elle me confondait avec sa propre vie,
Voyait tout dans mon ame; et je faisais partie
De ce monde enchante qui flottait sous ses yeux
Du bonheur de la terre et de l'espoir des cieux.
Elle ne pensait plus au temps, a la distance,
L'heure seule absorbait toute son existence:
Avant moi, cette vie etait sans souvenir,
Un soir de ces beaux jours etait tout l'avenir!
Elle se confiait a la douce nature
Qui souriait sur nous, a la priere pure
Qu'elle allait, le coeur plein de joie et non de pleurs,
A l'autel qu'elle aimait repandre avec ses fleurs;
Et sa main m'entrainait aux marches de son temple,
Et, comme un humble enfant, je suivais son exemple,
Et sa voix me disait tout bas: "Prie avec moi;
Car je ne comprends pas le ciel meme sans toi!"

Mais pourquoi m'entrainer vers ces scenes passees?
Laissons le vent gemir et le flot murmurer.
Revenez, revenez, o mes tristes pensees!
     Je veux rever, et non pleurer.

Voyez, dans son bassin, l'eau d'une source vive
S'arrondir comme un lac sous son etroite rive,
Bleue et claire, a l'abri du vent qui va courir
Et du rayon brulant qui pourrait la tarir.
Un cygne blanc nageant sur la nappe limpide,
En y plongeant son cou qu'enveloppe la ride,
Orne sans le ternir le liquide miroir
Et s'y berce au milieu des etoiles du soir;
Mais si, prenant son vol vers des sources nouvelles,
Il bat le flot tremblant de ses humides ailes,
Le ciel s'efface au sein de l'onde qui brunit,
La plume a blancs flocons y tombe et la ternit,
Comme si le vautour, ennemi de sa race,
De sa mort sur les flots avait seme la trace;
Et l'azur eclatant de ce lac enchante
N'est plus qu'une onde obscure ou le sable a monte.
Ainsi, quand je partis, tout trembla dans cette ame;
Le rayon s'eteignit, et sa mourante flamme
Remonta dans le ciel pour n'en plus revenir.
Elle n'attendit pas un second avenir,
Elle ne languit pas de doute en esperance,
Et ne disputa pas sa vie a la souffrance;
Elle but d'un seul trait le vase de douleur,
Dans sa premiere larme elle noya son coeur;
Et, semblable a l'oiseau, moins pur et moins beau qu'elle,
Qui le soir pour dormir met son cou sous son aile,
Elle s'enveloppa d'un muet desespoir,
Et s'endormit aussi; mais, helas! loin du soir!

Mais pourquoi m'entrainer vers ces scenes passees?
Laissons le vent gemir et le flot murmurer.
Revenez, revenez, o mes tristes pensees!
     Je veux rever, et non pleurer.

Elle a dormi quinze ans dans sa couche d'argile,
Et rien ne pleure plus sur son dernier asile;
Et le rapide oubli, second linceul des morts,
A couvert le sentier qui menait vers ces bords.
Nul ne visite plus cette pierre effacee,
Nul n'y songe et n'y prie.... excepte ma pensee,
Quand, remontant le flot de mes jours revolus,
Je demande a mon coeur tous ceux qui n'y sont plus,
Et que, les yeux flottants sur de cheres empreintes,
Je pleure dans mon ciel tant d'etoiles eteintes!
Elle fut la premiere, et sa douce lueur
D'un jour pieux et tendre eclaire encor mon coeur.

Mais pourquoi n'entrainer vers ces scenes passees?
Laissons le vent gemir et le flot murmurer.
Revenez, revenez, o mes tristes pensees!
     Je veux rever, et non pleurer.

Un arbuste epineux, a la pale verdure,
Est le seul monument que lui fit la nature:
Battu des vents de mer, du soleil calcine,
Comme un regret funebre au coeur enracine,
Il vit dans le rocher sans lui donner d'ombrage;
La poudre du chemin y blanchit son feuillage;
Il rampe pres de terre, ou ses rameaux penches
Par la dent des chevreaux sont toujours retranches;
Une fleur, au printemps, comme un flocon de neige,
Y flotte un jour ou deux; mais le vent qui l'assiege
L'effeuille avant qu'elle ait repandu son odeur,
Comme la vie, avant qu'elle ait charme le coeur!
Un oiseau de tendresse et de melancolie
S'y pose pour chanter sur le rameau qui plie.
Oh, dis! fleur que la vie a fait si tot fletrir!
N'est-il pas une terre ou tout doit refleurir?

Remontez, remontez a ces heures passees!
Vos tristes souvenirs m'aident a soupirer.
Allez ou va mon ame, allez, o mes pensees!
      Mon coeur est plein, je veux pleurer.


STANCES

Et j'ai dit dans mon coeur: Que faire de la vie?
Irai-je encor, suivant ceux qui m'ont devance,
Comme l'agneau qui passe, ou sa mere a passe,
Imiter des mortels l'immortelle folie?

L'un cherche sur les mers les tresors de Memnon,
Et la vague engloutit ses voeux et son navire;
Dans le sein de la gloire ou son genie aspire,
L'autre meurt enivre par l'echo d'un vain nom.

Avec nos passions formant sa vaste trame,
Celui-la fonde un trone, et monte pour tomber;
Dans des pieges plus doux aimant a succomber,
Celui-ci lit son sort dans les yeux d'une femme.

Le paresseux s'endort dans les bras de la faim;
Le laboureur conduit sa fertile charrue;
Le savant pense et lit; le guerrier frappe et tue;
Le mendiant s'assied sur le bord du chemin.

Ou vont-ils cependant? Ils vont ou va la feuille
Que chasse devant lui le souffle des hivers.
Ainsi vont se fletrir dans leurs travaux divers
Ces generations que le temps seme et cueille.

Ils luttaient contre lui, mais le temps a vaincu:
Comme un fleuve engloutit le sable de ses rives,
Je l'ai vu devorer leurs ombres fugitives,
Ils sont nes, ils sont morts: Seigneur, ont-ils vecu?

Pour moi, je chanterai le Maitre que j'adore,
Dans le bruit des cites, dans la paix des deserts,
Couche sur le rivage, ou flottant sur les mers,
Au declin du soleil, au reveil de l'aurore.

La terre m'a crie: "Qui donc est le Seigneur?"
Celui dont l'ame immense est partout repandue,
Celui dont un seul pas mesure l'etendue,
Celui dont le soleil emprunte sa splendeur,

Celui qui du neant a tire la matiere,
Celui qui sur le vide a fonde l'univers,
Celui qui sans rivage a renferme les mers,
Celui qui d'un regard a lance la lumiere,

Celui qui ne connait ni jour ni lendemain,
Celui qui de tout temps de soi-meme s'enfante,
Qui vit dans l'avenir comme a l'heure presente,
Et rappelle les temps echappes de sa main:

C'est lui, c'est le Seigneur!... Que ma langue redise
Les cent noms de sa gloire aux enfants des mortels:
Comme la harpe d'or pendue a ses autels,
Je chanterai pour lui jusqu'a ce qu'il me brise...


LES REVOLUTIONS

Marchez! l'humanite ne vit pas d'une idee!
Elle eteint chaque soir celle qui l'a guidee,
Elle en allume une autre a l'immortel flambeau:
Comme ces morts vetus de leur parure immonde,
Les generations emportent de ce monde
    Leurs vetements dans le tombeau.

La, c'est leurs dieux; ici, les moeurs de leurs ancetres,
Le glaive des tyrans, l'amulette des pretres,
Vieux lambeaux, vils haillons de cultes ou de lois:
Et quand apres mille ans dans leurs caveaux on fouille,
On est surpris de voir la risible depouille
    De ce qui fut l'homme autrefois.

Robes, toges, turbans, tuniques, pourpre, bure,
Sceptres, glaives, faisceaux, haches, houlette, armure,
Symboles vermoulus fondent sous votre main,
Tour a tour au plus fort, au plus fourbe, au plus digne,
Et vous vous demandez vainement sous quel signe
    Monte ou baisse le genre humain.

Sous le votre, o chretiens! L'homme en qui Dieu travaille
Change eternellement de formes et de taille:
Geant de l'avenir, a grandir destine,
Il use en vieillissant ses vieux vetements, comme
Des membres elargis font eclater sur l'homme
    Les langes ou l'enfant est ne.

L'humanite n'est pas le boeuf a courte haleine
Qui creuse a pas egaux son sillon dans la plaine
Et revient ruminer sur un sillon pareil:
C'est l'aigle rajeuni qui change son plumage,
Et qui monte affronter, de nuage en nuage,
    De plus hauts rayons du soleil.

Enfants de six mille ans qu'un peu de bruit etonne,
Ne vous troublez donc pas d'un mot nouveau qui tonne,
D'un empire eboule, d'un siecle qui s'en va!
Que vous font les debris qui jonchent la carriere?
Regardez en avant, et non pas en arriere:
    Le courant roule a Jehovah!

Que dans vos coeurs etroits vos esperances vagues
Ne croulent pas sans cesse avec toutes les vagues:
Ces flots vous porteront, hommes de peu de foi!
Qu'importent bruit et vent, poussiere et decadence,
Pourvu qu'au-dessus d'eux la haute Providence
    Deroule l'eternelle loi !

Vos siecles page a page epellent l'Evangile:
Vous n'y lisiez qu'un mot, et vous en lirez mille;
Vos enfants plus hardis y liront plus avant!
Ce livre est comme ceux des sibylles antiques,
Dont l'augure trouvait les feuillets prophetiques
    Siecle a siecle arraches au vent.

Dans la foudre et l'eclair votre Verbe aussi vole:
Montez a sa lueur, courez a sa parole,
Attendez sans effroi l'heure lente a venir,
Vous, enfants de celui qui, l'annoncant d'avance,
Du sommet d'une croix vit briller l'esperance
    Sur l'horizon de l'avenir!

Cet oracle sanglant chaque jour se revele;
L'esprit, en renversant, eleve et renouvelle.
Passagers ballottes dans vos siecles flottants,
Vous croyez reculer sur l'ocean des ages,
Et vous vous remontrez, apres mille naufrages,
    Plus loin sur la route des temps!

Ainsi quand le vaisseau qui vogue entre deux mondes
A perdu tout rivage, et ne voit que les ondes
S'elever et crouler comme deux sombres murs;
Quand le maitre a brouille les noeuds nombreux qu'il file,
Sur la plaine sans borne il se croit immobile
      Entre deux abimes obscures.

"C'est toujours, se dit-il dans son coeur plein de doute,
Meme onde que je vois, meme bruit que j'ecoute;
Le flot que j'ai franchi revient pour me bercer;
A les compter en vain mon esprit se consume,
C'est toujours de la vague, et toujours de l'ecume:
    Les jours flottent sans avancer!"


Et les jours et les flots semblent ainsi renaitre,
Trop pareils pour que l'oeil puisse les reconnaitre,
Et le regard trompe s'use en les regardant;
Et l'homme, que toujours leur ressemblance abuse,
Les brouille, les confond, les gourmande et t'accuse,
    Seigneur!... Ils marchent cependant!

Et quand sur cette mer, las de chercher sa route,
Du firmament splendide il explore la voute,
Des astres inconnus s'y levent a ses yeux;
Et, moins triste, aux parfums qui soufflent des rivages,
Au jour tiede et dore qui glisse des cordages,
    Il sent qu'il a change de cieux.

Nous donc, si le sol tremble au vieux toit de nos peres,
Ensevelissons-nous sous des cendres si cheres,
Tombons enveloppes de ces sacres linceuls!
Mais ne ressemblons pas a ces rois d'Assyrie
Qui trainaient au tombeau femmes, enfants, patrie,
    Et ne savaient pas mourir seuls;

Qui jetaient au bucher, avant que d'y descendre,
Famille, amis, coursiers, tresors reduits en cendre.
Espoir ou souvenirs de leurs jours plus heureux,
Et, livrant leur empire et leurs dieux a la flamme,
Auraient voulu qu'aussi l'univers n'eut qu'une ame,
    Pour que tout mourut avec eux!




ALFRED DE VIGNY


LE COR

I.

J'aime le son du cor, le soir, au fond des bois,
Soit qu'il chante les pleurs de la biche aux abois,
Ou l'adieu du chasseur que l'echo faible accueille
Et que le vent du nord porte de feuille en feuille.

Que de fois, seul, dans l'ombre a minuit demeure,
J'ai souri de l'entendre, et plus souvent pleure!
Car je croyais ouir de ces bruits prophetiques
Qui precedaient la mort des paladins antiques.

O montagnes d'azur! o pays adore,

Rocs de la Frazona, cirque du Marbore,
Cascades qui tombez des neiges entrainees,
Sources, gaves, ruisseaux, torrents des Pyrenees;

Monts geles et fleuris, trones des deux saisons,
Dont le front est de glace et le pied de gazons!
C'est la qu'il faut s'asseoir, c'est la qu'il faut entendre
Les airs lointains d'un cor melancolique et tendre.

Souvent un voyageur, lorsque l'air est sans bruit,
De cette voix d'airain fait retentir la nuit;
A ses chants cadences autour de lui se mele
L'harmonieux grelot du jeune agneau qui bele.

Une biche attentive, au lieu de se cacher,
Se suspend immobile au sommet du rocher,
Et la cascade unit, dans une chute immense,
Son eternelle plainte aux chants de la romance.

Ames des chevaliers, revenez-vous encor?
Est-ce vous qui parlez avec la voix du cor?
Roncevaux! Roncevaux! dans ta sombre vallee
L'ombre du grand Roland n'est donc pas consolee?

II.

Tous les preux etaient morts, mais aucun n'avait fui,
Il reste seul deboit, Olivier pres de lui;

L'Afrique sur le mont l'entoure et tremble encore.
"Roland, tu vas mourir, rends-toi, criait le More;

"Tous tes pairs sont couches dans les eaux des torrents."
Il rugit comme un tigre, et dit: "Si je me rends,
Africain, ce sera lorsque les Pyrenees

Sur l'onde avec leurs corps rouleront entrainees.

--Rends-toi donc, repond-il, ou meurs, car les voila;"
Et du plus haut des monts un grand rocher roula.
Il bondit, il roula jusqu'au fond de l'abime,
Et de ses pins, dans l'onde, il vint briser la cime.

"Merci! cria Roland; tu m'as fait un chemin."
Et, jusqu'au pied des monts le roulant d'une main,
Sur le roc affermi comme un geant s'elance;
Et, prete a fuir, l'armee a ce seul pas balance.

III.

Tranquilles cependant, Charlemagne et ses preux
Descendaient la montagne et se parlaient entre eux.
A l'horizon deja, par leurs eaux signalees,
De Luz et d'Argeles se montraient les vallees.

L'armee applaudissait. Le luth du troubadour
S'accordait pour chanter les saules de l'Adour;
Le vin francais coulait dans la coupe etrangere;
Le soldat, en riant, parlait a la bergere.

Roland gardait les monts: tous passaient sans effroi.
Assis nonchalamment sur un noir palefroi
Qui marchait revetu de housses violettes,
Turpin disait, tenant les saintes amulettes:

"Sire, on voit dans le ciel des nuages de feu;
Suspendez votre marche; il ne faut tenter Dieu.
Par monsieur saint Denis! certes ce sont des ames
Qui passent dans les airs sur ces vapeurs de flammes.

"Deux eclairs ont relui, puis deux autres encor."
Ici l'on entendit le son lointain du cor.
L'empereur etonne, se jetant en arriere,
Suspend du destrier la marche aventuriere.

"Entendez-vous? dit-il.-- Oui, ce sont des pasteurs
Rappelant les troupeaux epars sur les hauteurs,
Repondit l'archeveque, ou la voix etouffee
Du nain vert Oberon, qui parle avec sa fee."

Et l'empereur poursuit; mais son front soucieux
Est plus sombre et plus noir que l'orage des cieux;
Il craint la trahison, et, tandis qu'il y songe,
Le cor eclate et meurt, renait et se prolonge.

"Malheur! c'est mon neveu! malheur! car, si Roland
Appelle a son secours, ce doit etre en mourant.
Arriere, chevaliers, repassons la montagne!
Tremble encor sous nos pieds, sol trompeur de l'Espagne!"

IV.

Sur le plus haut des monts s'arretent les chevaux;
L'ecume les blanchit; sous leurs pieds, Roncevaux
Des feux mourants du jour a peine se colore.
A l'horizon lointain fuit l'etendard du More.

"Turpin, n'as-tu rien vu dans le fond du torrent?
--J'y vois deux chevaliers: l'un mort, l'autre expirant.
Tous deux sont ecrases sous une roche noire;
Le plus fort, dans sa main, eleve un cor d'ivoire,
Son ame en s'exhalant nous appela deux fois."

Dieu! que le son du cor est triste au fond des bois!


LA BOUTEILLE A LA MER

Courage, o faible enfant de qui ma solitude
Recoit ces chants plaintifs, sans nom, que vous jetez
Sous mes yeux ombrages du camail de l'etude.
Oubliez les enfants par la mort arretes;
Oubliez Chatterton, Gilbert et Malfilatre;
De l'oeuvre d'avenir saintement idolatre,
Enfin, oubliez l'homme en vous-meme.--Ecoutez:

Quand un grave marin voit que le vent l'emporte
Et que les mats brises pendent tous sur le pont,
Que dans son grand duel la mer est la plus forte

Et que par des calculs l'esprit en vain repond;
Que le courant l'ecrase et le roule en sa course,
Qu'il est sans gouvernail et, partant, sans ressource,
Il se croise les bras dans un calme profond.

Il voit les masses d'eau, les toise et les mesure,
Les meprise en sachant qu'il en est ecrase,
Soumet son ame au poids de la matiere impure
Et se sent mort ainsi que son vaisseau rase.
--A de certains moments, l'ame est sans resistance;
Mais le penseur s'isole et n'attend d'assistance
Que de la forte foi dont il est embrase.

Dans les heures du soir, le jeune Capitaine
A fait ce qu'il a pu pour le salut des siens.
Nul vaisseau n'apparait sur la vague lointaine,
La nuit tombe, et le brick court aux rocs indiens.
--Il se resigne, il prie; il se recueille, il pense
A celui qui soutient les poles et balance
L'equateur herisse des longs meridiens.

Son sacrifice est fait; mais il faut que la terre
Recueille du travail le pieux monument.
C'est le journal savant, le calcul solitaire,
Plus rare que la perle et que le diamant;
C'est la carte des flots faite dans la tempete,
La carte de recueil qui va briser sa tete:
Aux voyageurs futurs sublime testament.

Il ecrit: "Aujourd'hui, le courant nous entraine,
Desempares, perdus, sur la Terre-de-Feu.
Le courant porte a l'est. Notre mort est certaine:
Il faut cingler au nord pour bien passer ce lieu.
--Ci-joint est mon journal, portant quelques etudes
Des constellations des hautes latitudes.
Qu'il aborde, si c'est la volonte de Dieu!"

Puis, immobile et froid, comme le cap des brumes
Qui sert de sentinelle au detroit Magellan,
Sombre comme ces rocs au front charge d'ecumes,
Ces pics noirs dont chacun porte un deuil castillan,
Il ouvre une Bouteille et la choisit tres forte,
Tandis que son vaisseau que le courant emporte
Tourne en un cercle etroit comme un vol de milan.

Il tient dans une main cette vieille compagne,
Ferme, de l'autre main, son flanc noir et terni.
Le cachet porte encor le blason de Champagne,
De la mousse de Reims son col vert est jauni.
D'un regard, le marin en soi-meme rappelle
Quel jour il assembla l'equipage autour d'elle,
Pour porter un grand toste au pavillon beni.

On avait mis en panne, et c'etait grande fete;
Chaque homme sur son mat tenait le verre en main;
Chacun a son signal se decouvrit la tete,
Et repondit d'en haut par un hourra soudain.
Le soleil souriant dorait les voiles blanches;
L'air emu repetait ces voix males et franches,
Ce noble appel de l'homme a son pays lointain.

Apres le cri de tous, chacun reve en silence.
Dans la mousse d'Ai luit l'eclair d'un bonheur;
Tout au fond de son verre il apercoit la France.
La France est pour chacun ce qu'y laissa son coeur:
L'un y voit son vieux pere assis au coin de l'atre,
Comptant ses jours d'absence; a la table du patre,
Il voit sa chaise vide a cote de sa soeur.

Un autre y voit Paris, ou sa fille penchee
Marque avec les compas tous les souffles de l'air,
Ternit de pleurs la glace ou l'aiguille est cachee,
Et cherche a ramener l'aimant avec le fer.
Un autre y voit Marseille. Une femme se leve,
Court au port et lui tend un mouchoir de la greve,
Et ne sent pas ses pieds enfonces dans la mer.

O superstition des amours ineffables,
Murmures de nos coeurs qui nous semblez des voix,
Calculs de la science, o decevantes fables!
Pourquoi nous apparaitre en un jour tant de fois?
Pourquoi vers l'horizon nous tendre ainsi des pieges?
Esperances roulant comme roulent les neiges;
Globes toujours petris et fondus sous nos doigts!

Ou sont-ils a present? ou sont ces trois cents braves?
Renverses par le vent dans les courants maudits,
Aux harpons indiens ils portent pour epaves
Leurs habits dechires sur leurs corps refroidis.
Les savants officiers, la hache a la ceinture,
Ont peri les premiers en coupant la mature:
Ainsi, de ces trois cents, il n'en reste que dix!

Le capitaine encor jette un regard au pole
Dont il vient d'explorer les detroits inconnus.
L'eau monte a ses genoux et frappe son epaule;
Il peut lever au ciel l'un de ses deux bras nus.
Son navire est coule, sa vie est revolue:
Il lance la Bouteille a la mer, et salue
Les jours de l'avenir qui pour lui sont venus.

Il sourit en songeant que ce fragile verre
Portera sa pensee et son nom jusqu'au port;
Que d'une ile inconnue il agrandit la terre;
Qu'il marque un nouvel astre et le confie au sort;
Que Dieu peut bien permettre a des eaux insensees
De perdre des vaisseaux, mais non pas des pensees;
Et qu'avec un flacon il a vaincu la mort.

Tout est dit! A present, que Dieu lui soit en aide!
Sur le brick englouti l'onde a pris son niveau.
Au large flot de l'est le flot de l'ouest succede,
Et la Bouteille y roule en son vaste berceau.
Seule dans l'Ocean la frele passagere
N'a pas pour se guider une brise legere;
Mais elle vient de l'arche et porte le rameau.

Les courants l'emportaient, les glacons la retiennent
Et la couvrent des plis d'un epais manteau blanc.
Les noirs chevaux de mer la heurtent, puis reviennent
La flairer avec crainte, et passent en soufflant.
Elle attend que l'ete, changeant ses destinees,
Vienne ouvrir le rempart des glaces obstinees,
Et vers la ligne ardente elle monte en roulant.

Un jour tout etait calme et la mer Pacifique,
Par ses vagues d'azur, d'or et de diamant,
Renvoyait ses splendeurs au soleil du tropique.
Un navire y passait majestueusement;
Il a vu la Bouteille aux gens de mer sacree:
Il couvre de signaux sa flamme diapree,
Lance un canot en mer et s'arrete un moment.

Mais on entend au loin le canon des Corsaires;
Le Negrier va fuir s'il peut prendre le vent.
Alerte! et coulez bas ces sombres adversaires!
Noyez or et bourreaux du couchant au levant!
La Fregate reprend ses canots et les jette
En son sein, comme fait la sarigue inquiete,
Et par voile et vapeur vole et roule en avant.

Seule dans l'Ocean, seule toujours!--Perdue
Comme un point invisible en un mouvant desert,
L'aventuriere passe errant dans l'etendue,
Et voit tel cap secret qui n'est pas decouvert.
Tremblante voyageuse a flotter condamnee,
Elle sent sur son col que depuis une annee
L'algue et les goemons lui font un manteau vert.

Un soir enfin, les vents qui soufflent des Florides
L'entrainent vers la France et ses bords pluvieux.
Un pecheur accroupi sous des rochers arides
Tire dans ses filets le flacon precieux.
Il court, cherche un savant et lui montre sa prise,
Et, sans l'oser ouvrir, demande qu'on lui dise
Quel est cet elixir noir et mysterieux.

Quel est cet elixir? Pecheur, c'est la science,
C'est l'elixir divin que boivent les esprits,
Tresor de la pensee et de l'experience;
Et, si tes lourds filets, o pecheur, avaient pris
L'or qui toujours serpente aux veines du Mexique,
Les diamants de l'Inde et les perles d'Afrique,
Ton labeur de ce jour aurait eu moins de prix.

Regarde.--Quelle joie ardente et serieuse!
Une gloire de plus luit dans la nation.
Le canon tout-puissant et la cloche pieuse
Font sur les toits tremblants bondir l'emotion.
Aux heros du savoir plus qu'a ceux des batailles
On va faire aujourd'hui de grandes funerailles.
Lis ce mot sur les murs: "Commemoration!"

Souvenir eternel! gloire a la decouverte
Dans l'homme ou la nature egaux en profondeur,
Dans le Juste et le Bien, source a peine entr'ouverte,
Dans l'Art inepuisable, abime de splendeur!

Qu'importe oubli, morsure, injustice insensee,
Glaces et tourbillons de notre traversee?
Sur la pierre des morts croit l'arbre de grandeur.

Cet arbre est le plus beau de la terre promise,
C'est votre phare a tous, Penseurs laborieux!
Voguez sans jamais craindre ou les flots ou la brise
Pour tout tresor scelle du cachet precieux.
L'or pur doit surnager, et sa gloire est certaine;
Dites en souriant comme ce capitaine:
"Qu'il aborde, si c'est la volonte des dieux!"

Le vrai Dieu, le Dieu fort est le Dieu des idees.
Sur nos fronts ou le germe est jete par le sort,
Repandons le Savoir en fecondes ondees;
Puis, recueillant le fruit tel que de l'ame il sort,
Tout empreint des parfums des saintes solitudes,
Jetons l'oeuvre a la mer, la mer des multitudes:
--Dieu la prendra du doigt pour la conduire au port.




VICTOR HUGO


LES DJINNS

Et come i gru van cantando lor lai
Facendo in aer di se lunga riga,
Cosi vid' io venir, traendo guai,
Ombre portate dalla detta briga,--DANTE.

Et comme les grues qui font dans l'air de longues files vont chantant
leur plainte, ainsi je vis venir trainant des gemissements des ombres
emportees par cette tempete.

      Murs, ville,
      Et port,
      Asile
      De mort,
      Mer grise
      Ou brise
      La brise,
      Tout dort.

      Dans la plaine
      Nait un bruit.
      C'est l'haleine
      De la nuit.
      Elle brame
      Comme une ame
      Qu'une flamme
      Toujours suit.

    La voix plus haute
    Semble un grelot.
    D'un nain qui saute
    C'est le galop.
    Il fuit, s'elance,
    Puis en cadence
    Sur un pied danse
    Au bout d'un flot.

  La rumeur approche,
  L'echo la redit.
  C'est comme la cloche
  D'un couvent maudit,
  Comme un bruit de foule
  Qui tonne et qui roule,
  Et tantot s'ecroule,
  Et tantot grandit.

Dieu! la voix sepulcrale
Des Djinns! Quel bruit ils font!
Fuyons sous la spirale
De l'escalier profond!
Deja s'eteint ma lampe,
Et l'ombre de la rampe,
Qui le long du mur rampe,
Monte jusqu'au plafond.

  C'est l'essaim des Djinns qui passe
  Et tourbillonne en sifflant.
  Les ifs, que leur vol fracasse,
  Craquent comme un pin brulant.
  Leur troupeau lourd et rapide,
  Volant dans l'espace vide,
  Semble un nuage livide
  Qui porte un eclair au flanc.

  Ils sont tout pres!--Tenons fermee
  Cette salle ou nous les narguons.

  Quel bruit dehors! Hideuse armee
  De vampires et de dragons!
  La poutre du toit descellee
  Ploie ainsi qu'une herbe mouillee,
  Et la vieille porte rouillee
  Tremble a deraciner ses gonds.

Cris de l'enfer! voix qui hurle et qui pleure!
L'horrible essaim, pousse par l'aquilon,
Sans doute, o ciel! s'abat sur ma demeure.
Le mur flechit sous le noir bataillon.
La maison crie et chancelle penchee,
Et l'on dirait que, du sol arrachee,
Ainsi qu'il chasse une feuille sechee,
Le vent la roule avec leur tourbillon!

  Prophete! si ta main me sauve
  De ces impurs demons des soirs,
  J'irai prosterner mon front chauve
  Devant tes sacres encensoirs!
  Fais que sur ces portes fideles
  Meure leur souffle d'etincelles,
  Et qu'en vain l'ongle de leurs ailes
  Grince et crie a ces vitraux noirs!

Ils sont passes!--Leur cohorte
S'envole et fuit, et leurs pieds
Cessent de battre ma porte
De leurs coups multiplies.
L'air est plein d'un bruit de chaines,
Et dans les forets prochaines
Frissonnent tous les grands chenes,
Sous leur vol de feu plies!

    De leurs ailes lointaines
    Le battement decroit,
    Si confus dans les plaines,
    Si faible, que l'on croit
    Ouir la sauterelle
    Crier d'une voix grele
    Ou petiller la grele
    Sur le plomb d'un vieux toit.

      D'etranges syllabes
      Nous viennent encor:
      Ainsi, des arabes
      Quand sonne le cor,
      Un chant sur la greve
      Par instants s'eleve,
      Et l'enfant qui reve
      Fait des reves d'or.

      Les Djinns funebres,
      Fils du trepas,
      Dans les tenebres
      Pressent leurs pas;
      Leur essaim gronde:
      Ainsi, profonde,
      Murmure une onde
      Qu'on ne voit pas.

      Ce bruit vague
      Qui s'endort,
      C'est la vague

      Sur le bord;
      C'est la plainte
      Presque eteinte
      D'une sainte
      Pour un mort.

        On doute
        La nuit...
        J'ecoute:--
        Tout fuit.
        Tout passe;
        L'espace
        Efface
        Le bruit.


ATTENTE

Esperaba, desperada.

Monte, ecureuil, monte au grand chene,
Sur la branche des cieux prochaine,
Qui plie et tremble comme un jonc.
Cigogne, aux vieilles tours fidele,
Oh! vole et monte a tire-d'aile
De l'eglise a la citadelle,
Du haut clocher au grand donjon.

Vieux aigle, monte de ton aire
A la montagne centenaire

Que blanchit l'hiver eternel.
Et toi qu'en ta couche inquiete
Jamais l'aube ne vit muette,
Monte, monte, vive alouette,
Vive alouette, monte au ciel.

Et maintenant, du haut de l'arbre,

Des fleches de la tour de marbre,
Du grand mont, du ciel enflamme,
A l'horizon, parmi la brume,
Voyez-vous flotter une plume,
Et courir un cheval qui fume,
Et revenir mon bien-aime?


EXTASE

Et j'entendis une grande voix. _Apocalypse._

J'etais seul pres des flots, par une nuit d'etoiles.
Pas un nuage aux cieux, sur les mers pas de voiles.
Mes yeux plongeaient plus loin que le monde reel.
Et les bois, et les monts, et toute la nature,
Semblaient interroger dans un confus murmure
        Les flots des mers, les feux du ciel.

Et les etoiles d'or, legions infinies,
A voix haute, a voix basse, avec mille harmonies,
Disaient, en inclinant leurs couronnes de feu;
Et les flots bleus, que rien ne gouverne et n'arrete,
Disaient, en recourbant l'ecume de leur crete:
        --C'est le Seigneur, le Seigneur Dieu!


LORSQUE L'ENFANT PARAIT

Lorsque l'enfant parait, le cercle de famille
Applaudit a grands cris. Son doux regard qui brille
        Fait briller tous les yeux,
Et les plus tristes fronts, les plus souilles peut-etre,
Se derident soudain a voir l'enfant paraitre,
        Innocent et joyeux.

Soit que juin ait verdi mon seuil, ou que novembre
Fasse autour d'un grand feu vacillant dans la chambre
        Les chaises se toucher,
Quand l'enfant vient, la joie arrive et nous eclaire.
On rit, on se recrie, on l'appelle, et sa mere
        Tremble a le voir marcher.

Quelquefois nous parlons, en remuant la flamme,
De patrie et de Dieu, des poetes, de l'ame
        Qui s'eleve en priant;
L'enfant parait, adieu le ciel et la patrie
Et les poetes saints! la grave causerie
        S'arrete en souriant.

La nuit, quand l'homme dort, quand l'esprit reve, a l'heure
Ou l'on entend gemir, comme une voix qui pleure,
        L'onde entre les roseaux,
Si l'aube tout a coup la-bas luit comme un phare,
Sa clarte dans les champs eveille une fanfare
        De cloches et d'oiseaux.

Enfant, vous etes l'aube et mon ame est la plaine
Qui des plus douces fleurs embaume son haleine
        Quand vous la respirez;
Mon ame est la foret dont les sombres ramures
S'emplissent pour vous seul de suaves murmures
        Et de rayons dores.

Car vos beaux yeux sont pleins de douceurs infinies,
Car vos petites mains, joyeuses et benies,
        N'ont point mal fait encor;
Jamais vos jeunes pas n'ont touche notre fange,
Tete sacree! enfant aux cheveux blonds! bel ange
        A l'aureole d'or!

Vous etes parmi nous la colombe de l'arche.
Vos pieds tendres et purs n'ont point l'age ou l'on marche
        Vos ailes sont d'azur.
Sans le comprendre encor vous regardez le monde.
Double virginite! corps ou rien n'est immonde,
        Ame ou rien n'est impur!

Il est si beau, l'enfant, avec son doux sourire,
Sa douce bonne foi, sa voix qui veut tout dire,
        Ses pleurs vite apaises,
Laissant errer sa vue etonnee et ravie,
Offrant de toutes parts sa jeune ame a la vie
        Et sa bouche aux baisers.

Seigneur! preservez-moi, preservez ceux que j'aime,
Freres, parents, amis, et mes ennemis meme
        Dans le mal triomphants,
De jamais voir, Seigneur, l'ete sans fleurs vermeilles,
La cage sans oiseaux, la ruche sans abeilles,
        La maison sans enfants.


DANS L'ALCOVE SOMBRE

Beau, frais, souriant d'aise a cette vie amere.--SAINTE-BEUVE.

Dans l'alcove sombre,
Pres d'un humble autel,
L'enfant dort a l'ombre
Du lit maternel.
Tandis qu'il repose,
Sa paupiere rose,
Pour la terre close,
S'ouvre pour le ciel.

Il fait bien des reves.
Il voit par moments
Le sable des greves
Plein de diamants,
Des soleils de flammes,
Et de belles dames
Qui portent des ames
Dans leurs bras charmants.

Songe qui l'enchante!
Il voit des ruisseaux;
Une voix qui chante
Sort du fond des eaux.
Ses soeurs sont plus belles;
Son pere est pres d'elles;
Sa mere a des ailes
Comme les oiseaux.

Il voit mille choses
Plus belles encor;
Des lys et des roses
Plein le corridor;
Des lacs de delice
Ou le poisson glisse,
Ou l'onde se plisse
A des roseaux d'or!

Enfant, reve encore!
Dors, o mes amours!
Ta jeune ame ignore
Ou s'en vont tes jours.
Comme une algue morte
Tu vas, que t'importe?
Le courant t'emporte,
Mais tu dors toujours!

Sans soin, sans etude,
Tu dors en chemin,
Et l'inquietude
A la froide main,
De son ongle aride,
Sur ton front candide,
Qui n'a point de ride,
N'ecrit pas: "Demain!"

Il dort, innocence!
Les anges sereins
Qui savent d'avance
Le sort des humains,
Le voyant sans armes,
Sans peur, sans alarmes,
Baisent avec larmes
Ses petites mains.

Leurs levres effleurent
Ses levres de miel.
L'enfant voit qu'ils pleurent
Et dit: "Gabriel!"
Mais l'ange le touche,
Et, bercant sa couche,
Un doigt sur sa bouche,
Leve l'autre au ciel!

Cependant sa mere,
Prompte a le bercer,
Croit qu'une chimere
Le vient oppresser!
Fiere, elle l'admire,
L'entend qui soupire,
Et le fait sourire
Avec un baiser.


NOUVELLE CHANSON SUR UN VIEIL AIR

S'il est un charmant gazon
    Que le ciel arrose,
Ou brille en toute saison
    Quelque fleur eclose,
Ou l'on cueille a pleine main
Lys, chevrefeuille et jasmin,
J'en veux faire le chemin
    Ou ton pied se pose.

S'il est un sein bien aimant
    Dont l'honneur dispose,
Dont le ferme devouement
    N'ait rien de morose,
Si toujours ce noble sein
Bat pour un digne dessein,
J'en veux faire le coussin
    Ou ton front se pose!

S'il est un reve d'amour
    Parfume de rose
Ou l'on trouve chaque jour
    Quelque douce chose,
Un reve que Dieu benit,
Ou l'ame a l'ame s'unit,
Oh! j'en veux faire le nid
    Ou ton coeur se pose!


AUTRE CHANSON

L'aube et ta porte est close;
Ma belle, pourquoi sommeiller?
A l'heure ou s'eveille la rose
Ne vas-tu pas te reveiller?

        O ma charmante,
        Ecoute ici
        L'amant qui chante
        Et pleure aussi!

Tout frappe a ta porte benie.
L'aurore dit: Je suis le jour!
L'oiseau dit: Je suis l'harmonie!
Et mon coeur dit: Je suis l'amour!

        O ma charmante,
        Ecoute ici
        L'amant qui chante
        Et pleure aussi!

Je t'adore ange et t'aime femme.
Dieu qui par toi m'a complete
A fait mon amour pour ton ame
Et mon regard pour ta beaute.

        O ma charmante,
        Ecoute ici
        L'amant qui chante
        Et pleure aussi!


PUISQU'ICI-BAS TOUTE AME

Puisqu'ici-bas toute ame
      Donne a quelqu'un
Sa musique, sa flamme,
      Ou son parfum;

Puisqu'ici toute chose
      Donne toujours
Son epine ou sa rose
      A ses amours;

Puisqu'avril donne aux chenes
      Un bruit charmant;
Que la nuit donne aux peines
      L'oubli dormant;

Puisque l'air a la branche
      Donne l'oiseau;
Que l'aube a la pervenche
      Donne un peu d'eau;

Puisque, lorsqu'elle arrive
      S'y reposer,
L'onde amere a la rive
      Donne un baiser;

Je te donne a cette heure,
      Penche sur toi,
La chose la meilleure
      Que j'aie en moi!

Recois donc ma pensee,
      Triste d'ailleurs,
Qui, comme une rosee,
      T'arrive en pleurs!

Recois mes voeux sans nombre,
      O mes amours!
Recois la flamme ou l'ombre
      De tous mes jours!

Mes transports pleins d'ivresses,
      Purs de soupcons,
Et toutes les caresses
      De mes chansons!

Mon esprit qui sans voile
      Vogue au hasard,
Et qui n'a pour etoile
      Que ton regard!

Ma muse que les heures
      Bercent revant,
Qui, pleurant quand tu pleures,
      Pleure souvent!

Recois, mon bien celeste,
      O ma beaute,
Mon coeur, dont rien ne reste,
      L'amour ote.


OCEANO NOX

Oh! combien de marins, combien de capitaines
Qui sont partis joyeux pour des courses lointaines,
Dans ce morne horizon se sont evanouis!
Combien ont disparu, dure et triste fortune!
Dans une mer sans fond, par une nuit sans lune,
Sous l'aveugle ocean a jamais enfouis!
Combien de patrons morts avec leurs equipages!
L'ouragan de leur vie a pris toutes les pages,
Et d'un souffle il a tout disperse sur les flots!
Nul ne saura leur fin dans l'abime plongee.
Chaque vague en passant d'un butin s'est chargee;
L'une a saisi l'esquif, l'autre les matelots!
Nul ne sait votre sort, pauvres tetes perdues!
Vous roulez a travers les sombres etendues,
Heurtant de vos fronts morts des ecueils inconnus.
Oh! que de vieux parents, qui n'avaient plus qu'un reve,
Sont morts en attendant tous les jours sur la greve
         Ceux qui ne sont pas revenus!

On s'entretient de vous parfois dans les veillees.
Maint joyeux cercle, assis sur des ancres rouillees,
Mele encor quelque temps vos noms d'ombre couverts
Aux rires, aux refrains, aux recits d'aventures,
Aux baisers qu'on derobe a vos belles futures,
Tandis que vous dormez dans les goemons verts!

On demande:--Ou sont-ils? sont-ils rois dans quelque ile?
Nous ont-ils delaisses pour un bord plus fertile?
--Puis votre souvenir meme est enseveli.
Le corps se perd dans l'eau, le nom dans la memoire.
Le temps, qui sur toute ombre en verse une plus noire,
Sur le sombre ocean jette le sombre oubli.

Bientot des yeux de tous votre ombre est disparue.
L'un n'a-t-il pas sa barque et l'autre sa charrue?
Seules, durant ces nuits ou l'orage est vainqueur,
Vos veuves aux fronts blancs, lasses de vous attendre,
Parlent encor de vous en remuant la cendre
         De leur foyer et de leur coeur!

Et quand la tombe enfin a ferme leur paupiere,
Rien ne sait plus vos noms, pas meme une humble pierre
Dans l'etroit cimetiere ou l'echo nous repond,
Pas meme un saule vert qui s'effeuille a l'automne,
Pas meme la chanson naive et monotone
Que chante un mendiant a l'angle d'un vieux pont!

Ou sont-ils,les marins sombres dans les nuits noires?
O flots, que vous savez de lugubres histoires!
Flots profonds redoutes des meres a genoux!
Vous vous les racontez en montant les marees,
Et c'est ce qui vous fait ces voix desesperees
Que vous avez le soir quand vous venez vers nous!


NUITS DE JUIN

L'ete, lorsque le jour a fui, de fleurs couverte
La plaine verse au loin un parfum enivrant;
Les yeux fermes, l'oreille aux rumeurs entr'ouverte,
On ne dort qu'a demi d'un sommeil transparent.

Les astres sont plus purs, l'ombre parait meilleure;
Un vague demi-jour teint le dome eternel;
Et l'aube douce et pale, en attendant son heure,
Semble toute la nuit errer au bas du ciel.


LA TOMBE DIT A LA ROSE

La tombe dit a la rose:
--Des pleurs dont l'aube t'arrose
Que fais-tu, fleur des amours?
La rose dit a la tombe:
-- Que fais-tu de ce qui tombe
Dans ton gouffre ouvert toujours?

La rose dit:--Tombeau sombre,
De ces pleurs je fais dans l'ombre
Un parfum d'ambre et de miel.
La tombe dit:--Fleur plaintive,
De chaque ame qui m'arrive
Je fais un ange du ciel.


TRISTESSE D'OLYMPIO

Les champs n'etaient point noirs, les cieux n'etaient pas mornes;
Non, le jour rayonnait dans un azur sans bornes
      Sur la terre etendu,
L'air etait plein d'encens et les pres de verdures,
Quand il revit ces lieux ou par tant de blessures
      Son coeur s'est repandu.

L'automne souriait; les coteaux vers la plaine
Penchaient leurs bois charmants qui jaunissaient a peine,
      Le ciel etait dore;
Et les oiseaux, tournes vers celui que tout nomme,
Disant peut-etre a Dieu quelque chose de l'homme,
      Chantaient leur chant sacre.

Il voulut tout revoir, l'etang pres de la source,
La masure ou l'aumone avait vide leur bourse,
      Le vieux frene plie,
Les retraites d'amour au fond des bois perdues,
L'arbre ou dans les baisers leurs ames confondues
      Avaient tout oublie.

Il chercha le jardin, la maison isolee,
La grille d'ou l'oeil plonge en une oblique allee,
      Les vergers en talus.
Pale, il marchait.--Au bruit de son pas grave et sombre
Il voyait a chaque arbre, helas! se dresser l'ombre
      Des jours qui ne sont plus.

Il entendait fremir dans la foret qu'il aime
Ce doux vent qui, faisant tout vibrer en nous-meme,
      Y reveille l'amour,
Et, remuant le chene ou balancant la rose,
Semble l'ame de tout qui va sur chaque chose
      Se poser tour a tour.

Les feuilles qui gisaient dans le bois solitaire,
S'efforcant sous ses pas de s'elever de terre,
      Couraient dans le jardin;
Ainsi, parfois, quand l'ame est triste, nos pensees
S'envolent un moment sur leurs ailes blessees,
      Puis retombent soudain.

Il contempla longtemps les formes magnifiques
Que la nature prend dans les champs pacifiques;
      Il reva jusqu'au soir;
Tout le jour il erra le long de la ravine,
Admirant tour a tour le ciel, face divine,
      Le lac, divin miroir.

Helas! se rappelant ses douces aventures,
Regardant, sans entrer, par-dessus les clotures,
      Ainsi qu'un paria,
Il erra tout le jour. Vers l'heure ou la nuit tombe,
Il se sentit le coeur triste comme une tombe,
      Alors il s'ecria :

--"O douleur! j'ai voulu, moi dont l'ame est troublee,
Savoir si l'urne encor conservait la liqueur,
Et voir ce qu'avait fait cette heureuse vallee
De tout ce que j'avais laisse la de mon coeur!

"Que peu de temps suffit pour changer toutes choses!
Nature au front serein, comme vous oubliez!
Et comme vous brisez dans vos metamorphoses
Les fils mysterieux ou nos coeurs sont lies!

"Nos chambres de feuillage en halliers sont changees;
L'arbre ou fut notre chiffre est mort ou renverse;
Nos roses dans l'enclos ont ete ravagees
Par les petits enfants qui sautent le fosse.

"Un mur clot la fontaine ou, par l'heure echauffee,
Folatre, elle buvait en descendant des bois;
Elle prenait de l'eau dans sa main, douce fee,
Et laissait retomber des perles de ses doigts!

"On a pave la route apre et mal aplanie,
Ou, dans le sable pur se dessinant si bien,
Et de sa petitesse etalant l'ironie,
Son pied charmant semblait rire a cote du mien.

"La borne du chemin, qui vit des jours sans nombre,
Ou jadis pour m'attendre elle aimait a s'asseoir,
S'est usee en heurtant, lorsque la route est sombre,
Les grands chars gemissants qui reviennent le soir.

"La foret ici manque et la s'est agrandie....
De tout ce qui fut nous presque rien n'est vivant:
Et, comme un tas de cendre eteinte et refroidie,
L'amas des souvenirs se disperse a tout vent!

"N'existons-nous donc plus? Avons-nous eu notre heure?
Rien ne la rendra-t-il a nos cris superflus?
L'air joue avec la branche au moment ou je pleure;
Ma maison me regarde et ne me connait plus.

"D'autres vont maintenant passer ou nous passames.
Nous y sommes venus, d'autres vont y venir:
Et le songe qu'avaient ebauche nos deux ames,
Ils le continueront sans pouvoir le finir!

"Car personne ici-bas ne termine et n'acheve;
Les pires des humains sont comme les meilleurs!
Nous nous reveillons tous au meme endroit du reve.
Tout commence en ce monde et tout finit ailleurs.

"Oui, d'autres a leur tour viendront, couples sans tache,
Puiser dans cet asile heureux, calme, enchante,
Tout ce que la nature a l'amour qui se cache
Mele de reverie et de solennite!

"D'autres auront nos champs, nos sentiers, nos retraites.
Ton bois, ma bien-aimee, est a des inconnus.
D'autres femmes viendront, baigneuses indiscretes,
Troubler le flot sacre qu'ont touche tes pieds nus.

"Quoi donc! c'est vainement qu'ici nous nous aimames!
Rien ne nous restera de ces coteaux fleuris
Ou nous fondions notre etre en y melant nos flammes!
L'impassible nature a deja tout repris.

"Oh! dites-moi, ravins, frais ruisseaux, treilles mures,
Rameaux charges de nids, grottes, forets, buissons,
Est-ce que vous ferez pour d'autres vos murmures?
Est-ce que vous direz a d'autres vos chansons?

"Nous vous comprenions tant! doux, attentifs, austeres,
Tous nos echos s'ouvraient si bien a votre voix!
Et nous pretions si bien, sans troubler vos mysteres,
L'oreille aux mots profonds que vous dites parfois!

"Repondez, vallon pur, repondez, solitude,
O nature abritee en ce desert si beau,
Lorsque nous dormirons tous deux dans l'attitude
Que donne aux morts pensifs la forme du tombeau;

"Est-ce que vous serez a ce point insensible
De nous savoir couches, morts avec nos amours,
Et de continuer votre fete paisible,
Et de toujours sourire et de chanter toujours?

"Est-ce que, nous sentant errer dans vos retraites,
Fantomes reconnus par vos monts et vos bois,
Vous ne nous direz pas de ces choses secretes
Qu'on dit en revoyant des amis d'autrefois?

"Est-ce que vous pourrez, sans tristesse et sans plainte,
Voir nos ombres flotter ou marcherent nos pas,
Et la voir m'entrainer, dans une morne etreinte,
Vers quelque source en pleurs qui sanglote tout bas?

"Et s'il est quelque part, dans l'ombre ou rien ne veille,
Deux amants sous vos fleurs abritant leurs transports,
Ne leur irez-vous pas murmurer a l'oreille :
--Vous qui vivez, donnez une pensee aux morts?

"Dieu nous prete un moment les pres et les fontaines,
Les grands bois frissonnants, les rocs profonds et sourds,
Et les cieux azures et les lacs et les plaines,
Pour y mettre nos coeurs, nos reves, nos amours;

"Puis il nous les retire. Il souffle notre flamme.
Il plonge dans la nuit l'antre ou nous rayonnons,
Et dit a la vallee, ou s'imprima notre ame,
D'effacer notre trace et d'oublier nos noms.

"Eh bien! oubliez-nous, maison, jardin, ombrages;
Herbe, use notre seuil! ronce, cache nos pas!
Chantez, oiseaux! ruisseaux, coulez! croissez, feuillages!
Ceux que vous oubliez ne vous oublieront pas.

"Car vous etes pour nous l'ombre de l'amour meme,
Vous etes l'oasis qu'on rencontre en chemin!
Vous etes, o vallon, la retraite supreme
Ou nous avons pleure nous tenant par la main!

"Toutes les passions s'eloignent avec l'age,
L'une emportant son masque et l'autre son couteau,
Comme un essaim chantant d'histrions en voyage
Dont le groupe decroit derriere le coteau.

"Mais toi, rien ne t'efface, Amour! toi qui nous charmes!
Toi qui, torche ou flambeau, luis dans notre brouillard!
Tu nous tiens par la joie, et surtout par les larmes;
Jeune homme on te maudit, on t'adore vieillard.

"Dans ces jours ou la tete au poids des ans s'incline,
Ou l'homme, sans projets, sans but, sans visions,
Sent qu'il n'est deja plus qu'une tombe en ruine
Ou gisent ses vertus et ses illusions;

"Quand notre ame en revant descend dans nos entrailles,
Comptant dans notre coeur, qu'enfin la glace atteint,
Comme on compte les morts sur un champ de batailles,
Chaque douleur tombee et chaque songe eteint,

"Comme quelqu'un qui cherche en tenant une lampe,
Loin des objets reels, loin du monde rieur,
Elle arrive a pas lents par une obscure rampe
Jusqu'au fond desole du gouffre interieur;

"Et la, dans cette nuit qu'aucun rayon n'etoile,
L'ame, en un repli sombre ou tout semble finir,
Sent quelque chose encor palpiter sous un voile ...--
C'est toi qui dors dans l'ombre, o sacre souvenir!"


A QUOI BON ENTENDRE

A quoi bon entendre
Les oiseaux des bois?
L'oiseau le plus tendre
Chante dans ta voix.

Que Dieu montre ou voile
Les astres des cieux!
La plus pure etoile
Brille dans tes yeux.

Qu'avril renouvelle
Le jardin en fleur!
La fleur la plus belle
Fleurit dans ton coeur.

Cet oiseau de flamme,
Cet astre du jour,
Cette fleur de l'ame,
S'appelle l'amour.


CHANSON

Si vous n'avez rien a me dire,
Pourquoi venir aupres de moi?
Pourquoi me faire ce sourire
Qui tournerait la tete au roi?
Si vous n'avez rien a me dire,
Pourquoi venir aupres de moi?

Si vous n'avez rien a m'apprendre,
Pourquoi me pressez-vous la main?
Sur le reve angelique et tendre,
Auquel vous songez en chemin,
Si vous n'avez rien a m'apprendre,
Pourquoi me pressez-vous la main?

Si vous voulez que je m'en aille,
Pourquoi passez-vous par ici?
Lorsque je vous vois, je tressaille,
C'est ma joie et c'est mon souci.
Si vous voulez que je m'en aille,
Pourquoi passez-vous par ici?


QUAND NOUS HABITIONS TOUS ENSEMBLE

Quand nous habitions tous ensemble
Sur nos collines d'autrefois,
Ou l'eau court, ou le buisson tremble,
Dans la maison qui touche aux bois,

Elle avait dix ans, et moi trente;
J'etais pour elle l'univers.
Oh! comme l'herbe est odorante
Sous les arbres profonds et verts!

Elle faisait mon sort prospere,
Mon travail leger, mon ciel bleu.
Lorsqu'elle me disait: Mon pere,
Tout mon coeur s'ecriait: Mon Dieu!

A travers mes songes sans nombre,
J'ecoutais son parler joyeux,
Et mon front s'eclairait dans l'ombre
A la lumiere de ses yeux.

Elle avait l'air d'une princesse
Quand je la tenais par la main.
Elle cherchait des fleurs sans cesse
Et des pauvres dans le chemin.

Elle donnait comme on derobe,
En se cachant aux yeux de tous.
Oh! la belle petite robe
Qu'elle avait, vous rappelez-vous?

Le soir, aupres de ma bougie,
Elle jasait a petit bruit,
Tandis qu'a la vitre rougie
Heurtaient les papillons de nuit.

Les anges se miraient en elle.
Que son bonjour etait charmant!
Le ciel mettait dans sa prunelle
Ce regard qui jamais ne ment.

Oh! je l'avais, si jeune encore,
Vue apparaitre en mon destin!
C'etait l'enfant de mon aurore,
Et mon etoile du matin!

Quand la lune claire et sereine
Brillait aux cieux, dans ces beaux mois,
Comme nous allions dans la plaine!
Comme nous courions dans les bois!

Puis, vers la lumiere isolee
Etoilant le logis obscur,
Nous revenions par la vallee
En tournant le coin du vieux mur;

Nous revenions, coeurs pleins de flamme,
En parlant des splendeurs du ciel.
Je composais cette jeune ame
Comme l'abeille fait son miel.

Doux ange aux candides pensees,
Elle etait gaie en arrivant ...--
Toutes ces choses sont passees
Comme l'ombre et comme le vent!


O SOUVENIRS! PRINTEMPS! AURORE!

O Souvenir! printemps! aurore!
Doux rayon triste et rechauffant!
--Lorsqu'elle etait petite encore,
Que sa soeur etait tout enfant ...--

Connaissez-vous sur la colline
Qui joint Montlignon a Saint-Leu,
Une terrasse qui s'incline
Entre un bois sombre et le ciel bleu?

C'est la que nous vivions.--Penetre,
Mon coeur, dans ce passe charmant!--
Je l'entendais sous ma fenetre
Jouer le matin doucement.

Elle courait dans la rosee,
Sans bruit, de peur de m'eveiller;
Moi, je n'ouvrais pas ma croisee,
De peur de la faire envoler.

Ses freres riaient ...--Aube pure!
Tout chantait sous ces frais berceaux,
Ma famille avec la nature.
Mes enfants avec les oiseaux?

Je toussais, on devenait brave.
Elle montait a petits pas,
Et me disait d'un air tres grave:
J'ai laisse les enfants en bas.

Qu'elle fut bien ou mal coiffee,
Que mon coeur fut triste ou joyeux
Je l'admirais. C'etait ma fee,
Et le doux astre de mes yeux!

Nous jouions toute la journee.
O jeux charmants! chers entretiens!
Le soir, comme elle etait l'ainee,
Elle me disait:--Pere, viens!

Nous allons t'apporter ta chaise,
Conte-nous une histoire, dis!--
Et je voyais rayonner d'aise
Tous ces regards du paradis.

Alors, prodiguant les carnages,
J'inventais un conte profond
Dont je trouvais les personnages
Parmi les ombres du plafond.

Toujours, ces quatre douces tetes
Riaient, comme a cet age on rit,
De voir d'affreux geants tres betes
Vaincus par des nains pleins d'esprit.

J'etais l'Arioste et l'Homere
D'un poeme eclos d'un seul jet:
Pendant que je parlais, leur mere
Les regardait rire, et songeait.

Leur aieul, qui lisait dans l'ombre,
Sur eux parfois levait les yeux,
Et moi, par la fenetre sombre,
J'entrevoyais un coin des cieux!


DEMAIN, DES L'AUBE

Demain, des l'aube, a l'heure ou blanchit la campagne,
Je partirai. Vois-tu, je sais que tu m'attends.
J'irai par la foret, j'irai par la montagne.
Je ne puis demeurer loin de toi plus longtemps.

Je marcherai les yeux fixes sur mes pensees,
Sans rien voir au dehors, sans entendre aucun bruit,
Seul, inconnu, le dos courbe, les mains croisees,
Triste, et le jour pour moi sera comme la nuit.

Je ne regarderai ni l'or du soir qui tombe,
Ni les voiles au loin descendant vers Harfleur,
Et quand j'arriverai, je mettrai sur ta tombe
Un bouquet de houx vert et de bruyere en fleur.


VENI, VIDI, VIXI

J'ai bien assez vecu, puisque dans mes douleurs
Je marche sans trouver de bras qui me secourent,
Puisque je ris a peine aux enfants qui m'entourent,
Puisque je ne suis plus rejoui par les fleurs;

Puisqu'au printemps, quand Dieu met la nature en fete,
J'assiste, esprit sans joie, a ce splendide amour;
Puisque je suis a l'heure ou l'homme fuit le jour,
Helas! et sent de tout la tristesse secrete;

Puisque l'espoir serein dans mon ame est vaincu;
Puisqu'en cette saison des parfums et des roses,
O ma fille! j'aspire a l'ombre ou tu reposes,
Puisque mon coeur est mort, j'ai bien assez vecu.

Je n'ai pas refuse ma tache sur la terre.
Mon sillon? Le voila. Ma gerbe? La voici.
J'ai vecu souriant, toujours plus adouci,
Debout, mais incline du cote du mystere.

J'ai fait ce que j'ai pu: j'ai servi, j'ai veille,
Et j'ai vu bien souvent qu'on riait de ma peine.
Je me suis etonne d'etre un objet de haine,
Ayant beaucoup souffert et beaucoup travaille.

Dans ce bagne terrestre ou ne s'ouvre aucune aile,
Sans me plaindre, saignant, et tombant sur les mains,
Morne, epuise, raille par les forcats humains,
J'ai porte mon chainon de la chaine eternelle.

Maintenant mon regard ne s'ouvre qu'a demi:
Je ne me tourne plus meme quand on me nomme;
Je suis plein de stupeur et d'ennui, comme un homme
Qui se leve avant l'aube et qui n'a pas dormi.

Je ne daigne plus meme, en ma sombre paresse,
Repondre a l'envieux dont la bouche me nuit.
O Seigneur! ouvrez-moi les portes de la nuit,
Afin que je m'en aille et que je disparaisse!


LE CHANT DE CEUX QUI S'EN VONT SUR MER

(Air breton.)

         Adieu, patrie!
       L'onde est en furie.
         Adieu, patrie,
           Azur!

Adieu, maison, treille au fruit mur,
Adieu, les fleurs d'or du vieux mur!

         Adieu, patrie!
       Ciel, foret, prairie,
         Adieu, patrie,
           Azur!

         Adieu, patrie!
       L'onde est en furie.
         Adieu, patrie,
           Azur!

Adieu, fiancee au front pur,
Le ciel est noir, le vent est dur.

         Adieu, patrie!
       Lise, Anna, Marie!
         Adieu, patrie,
           Azur!

         Adieu, patrie.
       L'onde est en furie.
         Adieu, patrie,
           Azur!

Notre oeil que voile un deuil futur
Va du flot sombre au sort obscur.

         Adieu, patrie!
       Pour toi mon coeur prie.
         Adieu, patrie,
           Azur!


LUNA

O France, quoique tu sommeilles,
Nous t'appelons, nous, les proscrits!
Les tenebres ont des oreilles,
Et les profondeurs ont des cris.

Le despotisme apre et sans gloire
Sur les peuples decourages
Ferme la grille epaisse et noire
Des erreurs et des prejuges;

Il tient sous clef l'essaim fidele
Des fermes penseurs, des heros,
Mais l'Idee avec un coup d'aile
Ecartera les durs barreaux,

Et, comme en l'an quatre-vingt-onze,
Reprendra son vol souverain;
Car briser la cage de bronze,
C'est facile a l'oiseau d'airain.

L'obscurite couvre le monde,
Mais l'Idee illumine et luit;
De sa clarte blanche elle inonde
Les sombres azurs de la nuit.

Elle est le fanal solitaire,
Le rayon providentiel.
Elle est la lampe de la terre
Qui ne peut s'allumer qu'au ciel.

Elle apaise l'ame qui souffre,
Guide la vie, endort la mort;
Elle montre aux mechants le gouffre,
Elle montre aux justes le port.

En voyant dans la brume obscure
L'Idee, amour des tristes yeux,
Monter calme, sereine et pure,
Sur l'horizon mysterieux,

Les fanatismes et les haines
Rugissent devant chaque seuil
Comme hurlent les chiens obscenes
Quand apparait la lune en deuil.

Oh! contemplez l'Idee altiere,
Nations! son front surhumain
A, des a present, la lumiere
Qui vous eclairera demain!


LE CHASSEUR NOIR

Qu'es-tu, passant? Le bois est sombre,
Les corbeaux volent en grand nombre,
         Il va pleuvoir.
Je suis celui qui va dans l'ombre,
         Le chasseur noir!

Les feuilles des bois, du vent remuees,
         Sifflent ... on dirait
Qu'un sabbat nocturne emplit de huees
         Toute la foret;
Dans une clairiere, au sein des nuees,
         La lune apparait.

Chasse le daim, chasse la biche,
Cours dans les bois, cours dans la friche,
         Voici le soir.
Chasse le czar, chasse l'Autriche,
         O chasseur noir!

Les feuilles des bois, etc.

Souffle en ton cor, boucle ta guetre,
Chasse les cerfs qui viennent paitre
         Pres du manoir.
Chasse le roi, chasse le pretre,
         O chasseur noir.

Les feuilles des bois, etc.

Il tonne, il pleut, c'est le deluge.
Le renard fuit, pas de refuge
         Et pas d'espoir!
Chasse l'espion, chasse le juge,
         O chasseur noir.

Les feuilles des bois, etc.

Tous les demons de saint Antoine
Bondissent dans la folle avoine
         Sans t'emouvoir;
Chasse l'abbe, chasse le moine,
         O chasseur noir!

Les feuilles des bois, etc.

Chasse les ours! Ta meute jappe.
Que pas un sanglier n'echappe!
         Fais ton devoir!
Chasse Cesar, chasse le pape,
         O chasseur noir!

Les feuilles des bois, etc.

Le loup de ton sentier s'ecarte.
Que ta meute a sa suite parte!
         Cours! Fais-le choir!
Chasse le brigand Bonaparte,
         O chasseur noir!

Les feuilles des bois, du vent remuees,
         Tombent ... on dirait
Que le sabbat sombre aux rauques huees
         A fui la foret;
Le clair chant du coq perce les nuees;
         Ciel! L'aube apparait!

Tout reprend sa force premiere.
Tu redeviens la France altiere
         Si belle a voir,
L'ange blanc vetu de lumiere,
         O chasseur noir!

Les feuilles des bois, du vent remuees,
         Tombent ... on dirait
Que le sabbat sombre aux rauques huees
         A fui la foret!
Le clair chant du coq perce les nuees;
         Ciel! L'aube apparait!


LUX

Temps futurs! vision sublime!
Les peuples sont hors de l'abime.
Le desert morne est traverse.
Apres les sables, la pelouse;
Et la terre est comme une epouse,
Et l'homme est comme un fiance!

Oh! voyez! la nuit se dissipe.
Sur le monde qui s'emancipe,
Oubliant Cesars et Capets,
Et sur les nations nubiles,
S'ouvrent dans l'azur, immobiles,
Les vastes ailes de la paix!

O libre France enfin surgie
O robe blanche apres l'orgie!
O triomphe apres les douleurs!
Le travail bruit dans les forges,
Le ciel rit, et les rouges-gorges
Chantent dans l'aubepine en fleurs!

Les rancunes sont effacees;
Tous les coeurs, toutes les pensees,
Qu'anime le meme dessin
Ne font plus qu'un faisceau superbe
Dieu prend pour lier cette gerbe
La vieille corde du tocsin.

Au fond des cieux un point scintille.
Regardez, il grandit, il brille,
Il approche, enorme et vermeil.
O Republique universelle,
Tu n'es encor que l'etincelle,
Demain tu seras le soleil.


ULTIMA VERBA

Oh! tant qu'on le verra troner, ce gueux, ce prince,
Par le pape beni, monarque malandrin,
Dans une main le sceptre et dans l'autre la pince,
Charlemagne taille par Satan dans Mandrin;

Tant qu'il se vautrera, broyant dans ses machoires
Le serment, la vertu, l'honneur religieux,
Ivre, affreux, vomissant sa honte sur nos gloires;
Tant qu'on verra cela sous le soleil des cieux;

Quand meme grandirait l'abjection publique
A ce point d'adorer l'execrable trompeur;
Quand meme l'Angleterre et meme l'Amerique
Diraient a l'exile:--Va-t'en! nous avons peur!

Quand meme nous serions comme la feuille morte;
Quand, pour plaire a Cesar, on nous rentrait tous;
Quand le proscrit devrait s'enfuir de porte en porte,
Aux hommes dechire comme un haillon aux clous;

Quand le desert, ou Dieu contre l'homme proteste,
Bannirait les bannis, chasserait les chasses;
Quand meme, infame aussi, lache comme le reste,
Le tombeau jetterait dehors les trepasses;

Je ne flechirai pas! Sans plainte dans la bouche,
Calme, le deuil au coeur, dedaignant le troupeau,
Je vous embrasserai dans mon exil farouche,
Patrie, o mon autel! liberte, mon drapeau!

Mes nobles compagnons, je garde votre culte;
Bannis, la republique est la qui nous unit.
J'attacherai la gloire a tout ce qu'on insulte;
Je jetterai l'opprobre a tout ce qu'on benit!

Je serai, sous le sac de cendre qui me couvre,
La voix qui dit: malheur! la bouche qui dit: non!
Tandis que tes valets te montreront ton Louvre,
Moi, je te montrerai, Cesar, ton cabanon.

Devant les trahisons et les tetes courbees,
Je croiserai les bras, indigne, mais serein.
Sombre fidelite pour les choses tombees,
Sois ma force et ma joie et mon pilier d'airain!

Oui, tant qu'il sera la, qu'on cede ou qu'on persiste,
O France! France aimee et qu'on pleure toujours,
Je ne reverrai pas ta terre douce et triste,
Tombeau de mes aieux et nid de mes amours!

Je ne reverrai pas ta rive qui nous tente,
France! hors le devoir, helas! j'oublirai tout.
Parmi les eprouves je planterai ma tente.
Je resterai proscrit, voulant rester debout.

J'accepte l'apre exil, n'eut-il ni fin ni terme,
Sans chercher a savoir et sans considerer
Si quelqu'un a plie qu'on aurait cru plus ferme,
Et si plusieurs s'en vont qui devraient demeurer.

Si l'on n'est plus que mille, eh bien, j'en suis! Si meme
Ils ne sont plus que cent, je brave encor Sylla;
S'il en demeure dix, je serai le dixieme;
Et s'il n'en reste qu'un, je serai celui-la!



CHANSON

Proscrit, regarde les roses;
Mai joyeux, de l'aube en pleurs
Les recoit toutes ecloses;
Proscrit, regarde les fleurs.

              --Je pense
Aux roses que je semai.
Le mois de mai sans la France,
Ce n'est pas le mois de mai.

Proscrit, regarde les tombes;
Mai, qui rit aux cieux si beaux,
Sous les baisers des colombes
Fait palpiter les tombeaux.

              --Je pense
Aux yeux chers que je fermai.
Le mois de mai sans la France
Ce n'est pas le mois de mai.

Proscrit, regarde les branches,
Les branches ou sont les nids;
Mai les remplit d'ailes blanches
Et de soupirs infinis.

              --Je pense
Aux nids charmants ou j'aimai.
Le mois de mai sans la France,
Ce n'est pas le mois de mai.


EXIL

Si je pouvais voir, o patrie,
Tes amandiers et tes lilas,
Et fouler ton herbe fleurie,
           Helas!

Si je pouvais,--mais o mon pere,
O ma mere, je ne peux pas,--
Prendre pour chevet votre pierre,
           Helas!

Dans le froid cercueil qui vous gene,
Si je pouvais vous parler bas,
Mon frere Abel, mon frere Eugene,
          Helas!

Si je pouvais, o ma colombe,
Et toi, mere, qui t'envolas,
M'agenouiller sur votre tombe,
          Helas!

Oh! vers l'etoile solitaire,
Comme je leverais les bras!
Comme je baiserais la terre,
          Helas!

Loin de vous, o morts que je pleure,
Des flots noirs j'ecoute le glas;
Je voudrais fuir, mais je demeure,
          Helas!

Pourtant le sort, cache dans l'ombre,
Se trompe si, comptant mes pas,
Il croit que le vieux marcheur sombre
          Est las.


SAISON DES SEMAILLES

LE SOIR

C'est le moment crepusculaire.
J'admire, assis sous un portail,
Ce reste de jour dont s'eclaire
La derniere heure du travail.

Dans les terres, de nuit baignees,
Je contemple, emu, les haillons
D'un vieillard qui jette a poignees
La moisson future aux sillons.

Sa haute silhouette noire
Domine les profonds labours.
On sent a quel point il doit croire
A la fuite utile des jours.

Il marche dans la plaine immense,
Va, vient, lance la graine au loin,
Rouvre sa main et recommence,
Et je medite, obscur temoin,

Pendant que, deployant ses voiles,
L'ombre, ou se mele une rumeur,
Semble elargir jusqu'aux etoiles
Le geste auguste du semeur.


UN HYMNE HARMONIEUX

Un hymne harmonieux sort des feuilles du tremble;
Les voyageurs craintifs, qui vont la nuit ensemble,
Haussent la voix dans l'ombre ou l'on doit se hater.
          Laissez tout ce qui tremble
                   Chanter!

Les marins fatigues sommeillent sur le gouffre.
La mer bleue ou Vesuve epand ses flots de soufre
Se tait des qu'il s'eteint, et cesse de gemir.
          Laissez tout ce qui souffre
                   Dormir!

Quand la vie est mauvaise on la reve meilleure.
Les yeux en pleurs au ciel se levent a toute heure;
L'espoir vers Dieu se tourne et Dieu l'entend crier.
          Laissez tout ce qui pleure
                   Prier!

C'est pour renaitre ailleurs qu'ici-bas on succombe.
Tout ce qui tourbillonne appartient a la tombe.
Il faut dans le grand tout tot ou tard s'absorber.
          Laissez tout ce qui tombe
                   Tomber!


PROMENADES DANS LES ROCHERS

i.

Un tourbillon d'ecume, au centre de la baie
Forme par de secrets et profonds entonnoirs,
Se berce mollement sur l'onde qu'il egaie,
Vasque immense d'albatre au milieu des flots noirs.

Seigneur, que faites-vous de cette urne de neige?
Qu'y versez-vous des l'aube et qu'en sort-il la nuit?
La mer lui jette en vain sa vague qui l'assiege,
Le nuage sa brume et l'ouragan son bruit.

L'orage avec son bruit, le flot avec sa fange,
Passent; le tourbillon, venere du pecheur,
Reparait, conservant, dans l'abime ou tout change,
Toujours la meme place et la meme blancheur.

Le pecheur dit: "C'est la qu'en une onde benie,
Les petits enfants morts, chaque nuit de Noel,
Viennent blanchir leur aile au souffle humain ternie.
Avant de s'envoler pour etre anges au ciel."

Moi, je dis: "Dieu mit la cette coupe si pure,
Blanche en depit des flots et des rochers penchants,
Pour etre dans le sein de la grande nature,
La figure du juste au milieu des mechants."

ii.

La mer donne l'ecume et la terre le sable.
L'or se mele a l'argent dans les plis du flot vert.
J'entends le bruit que fait l'ether infranchissable,
Bruit immense et lointain, de silence couvert.

Un enfant chante aupres de la mer qui murmure.
Rien n'est grand, ni petit. Vous avez mis, mon Dieu,
Sur la creation et sur la creature
Les memes astres d'or et le meme ciel bleu.

Notre sort est chetif; nos visions sont belles.
L'esprit saisit le corps et l'enleve au grand jour.
L'homme est un point qui vole avec deux grandes ailes,
Dont l'une est la pensee et dont l'autre est l'amour.

Serenite de tout! majeste! force et grace!
La voile rentre au port et les oiseaux aux nids.
Tout va se reposer, et j'entends dans l'espace
Palpiter vaguement des baisers infinis.

Le vent courbe les joncs sur le rocher superbe,
Et de l'enfant qui chante il emporte la voix.
O vent! que vous courbez a la fois de brins d'herbe
Et que vous emportez de chansons a la fois!

Qu'importe! Ici tout berce, et rassure, et caresse.
Plus d'ombre dans le coeur! plus de soucis amers!
Une ineffable paix monte et descend sans cesse
Du bleu profond de l'ame au bleu profond des mers.

iii.

Le soleil declinait; le soir prompt a le suivre
Brunissait l'horizon; sur la pierre d'un champ,
Un vieillard, qui n'a plus que peu de temps a vivre,
S'etait assis pensif, tourne vers le couchant.

C'etait un vieux pasteur, berger dans la montagne,
Qui jadis, jeune et pauvre, heureux, libre et sans lois,
A l'heure ou le mont fuit sous l'ombre qui le gagne,
Faisait gaiment chanter sa flute dans les bois.

Maintenant riche et vieux, l'ame du passe pleine,
D'une grande famille aieul laborieux,
Tandis que ses troupeaux revenaient dans la plaine,
Detache de la terre, il contemplait les cieux.

Le jour qui va finir vaut le jour qui commence.
Le vieux penseur revait sous cet azur si beau.
L'Ocean devant lui se prolongeait, immense,
Comme l'espoir du juste aux portes du tombeau.

O moment solennel! les monts, la mer farouche,
Les vents faisaient silence et cessaient leur clameur.
Le vieillard regardait le soleil qui se couche;
Le soleil regardait le vieillard qui se meurt.

iv.

Dieu! que les monts sont beaux avec ces taches d'ombre!
Que la mer a de grace et le ciel de clarte!
De mes jours passagers que m'importe le nombre!
Je touche l'infini, je vois l'eternite.

Orages! passions! taisez-vous dans mon ame!
Jamais si pres de Dieu mon coeur n'a penetre.
Le couchant me regarde avec ses yeux de flamme,
La vaste mer me parle, et je me sens sacre.

Beni soit qui me hait et beni soit qui m'aime!
A l'amour, a l'esprit donnons tous nos instants.
Fou qui poursuit la gloire ou qui creuse un probleme!
Moi, je ne veux qu'aimer, car j'ai si peu de temps!

L'etoile sort des flots ou le soleil se noie;
Le nid chante; la vague a mes pieds retentit;
Dans toute sa splendeur le soleil se deploie.
Mon Dieu, que l'ame est grande et que l'homme est petit!

Tous les objets crees, feu qui luit, mer qui tremble,
Ne savent qu'a demi le grand nom du Tres-Haut.
Ils jettent vaguement des sons que seul j'assemble;
Chacun dit sa syllabe, et moi je dis le mot.

Ma voix s'eleve aux cieux, comme la tienne, abime!
Mer, je reve avec toi! Monts, je prie avec vous!
La nature est l'encens, pur, eternel, sublime;
Moi je suis l'encensoir intelligent et doux.


BRIZEUX

LE LIVRE BLANC

J'entrais dans mes seize ans, leger de corps et d'ame,
Mes cheveux entouraient mon front d'un filet d'or,
Tout mon etre etait vierge et pourtant plein de flamme,
Et vers mille bonheurs je tentais mon essor.

Lors m'apparut mon ange, aimante creature;
Un beau livre brillait sur sa robe de lin,
Livre blanc; chaque feuille etait unie et pure:
"C'est a toi, me dit-il, d'en remplir le velin.

"Tache de n'y laisser aucune page vide,
Que l'an, le mois, le jour, attestent ton labeur.
Point de ligne surtout et tremblante et livide
Que l'oeil fuit, que la main ne tourne qu'avec peur.

"Fais une histoire calme et doucement suivie;
Pense, chaque matin, a la page du soir:
Vieillard, tu souriras au livre de ta vie,
Et Dieu te sourira lui-meme en ton miroir."




AUGUSTE BARBIER


L'IDOLE

O Corse a cheveux plats! que ta France etait belle
       Au grand soleil de messidor!
C'etait une cavale indomptable et rebelle,
       Sans freins d'acier ni renes d'or;
Une jument sauvage a la croupe rustique,
       Fumante encor du sang des rois,
Mais fiere, et d'un pied fort heurtant le sol antique,
       Libre pour la premiere fois.
Jamais aucune main n'avait passe sur elle
       Pour la fletrir et l'outrager;
Jamais ses larges flancs n'avaient porte la selle
       Et le harnais de l'etranger;
Tout son poil etait vierge, et, belle vagabonde,
       L'oeil haut, la croupe en mouvement,
Sur ses jarrets dressee, elle effrayait le monde
       Du bruit de son hennissement.
Tu parus, et sitot que tu vis son allure,
       Ses reins si souples et dispos,
Centaure impetueux, tu pris sa chevelure,
       Tu montas botte sur son dos.
Alors, comme elle aimait les rumeurs de la guerre,
       La poudre, les tambours battants,
Pour champ de course, alors, tu lui donnas la terre
       Et des combats pour passe-temps:
Alors, plus de repos, plus de nuits, plus de sommes;
       Toujours l'air, toujours le travail,
Toujours comme du sable ecraser des corps d'hommes,
       Toujours du sang jusqu'au poitrail;
Quinze ans son dur sabot, dans sa course rapide,
       Broya les generations;
Quinze ans elle passa, fumante, a toute bride,
       Sur le ventre des nations;
Enfin, lasse d'aller sans finir sa carriere,
       D'aller sans user son chemin,
De petrir l'univers, et comme une poussiere
       De soulever le genre humain;
Les jarrets epuises, haletante et sans force,
       Pres de flechir a chaque pas,
Elle demanda grace a son cavalier corse;
       Mais, bourreau, tu n'ecoutas pas!
Tu la pressas plus fort de ta cuisse nerveuse;
       Pour etouffer ses cris ardents,
Tu retournas le mors dans sa bouche baveuse,
       De fureur tu brisas ses dents;
Elle se releva: mais un jour de bataille,
       Ne pouvant plus mordre ses freins,
Mourante, elle tomba sur un lit de mitraille
       Et du coup te cassa les reins.




MME. D'AGOULT


L'ADIEU

Non, tu n'entendras pas, de ta levre trop fiere,
Dans l'adieu dechirant un reproche, un regret,
Nul trouble, nul remords pour ton ame legere
      En cet adieu muet.

Tu croiras qu'elle aussi, d'un vain bruit enivree,
Et des larmes d'hier oublieuse demain,
Elle a d'un ris moqueur rompu la foi juree
      Et passe son chemin;

Et tu ne sauras pas qu'implacable et fidele,
Pour un sombre voyage elle part sans retour,
Et qu'en fuyant l'amant, dans la nuit eternelle
      Elle emporte l'amour.




ARVERS


UN SECRET

Mon ame a son secret, ma vie a son mystere:
Un amour eternel en un moment concu.
Le mal est sans espoir, aussi j'ai du le taire,
Et celle qui l'a fait n'en a jamais rien su.

Helas! j'aurai passe pres d'elle inapercu,
Toujours a ses cotes et toujours solitaire;
Et j'aurai jusqu'au bout fait mon temps sur la terre,
N'osant rien demander et n'ayant rien recu.

Pour elle, quoique Dieu l'ait faite douce et tendre,
Elle suit son chemin, distraite et sans entendre
Ce murmure d'amour eleve sur ses pas.

A l'austere devoir pieusement fidele,
Elle dira, lisant ces vers tout remplis d'elle:
"Quelle est donc cette femme?" et ne comprendra pas.




GERARD DE NERVAL

FANTASIE

Il est un air pour qui je donnerais
Tout Rossini, tout Mozart, tout Weber,
Un air tres vieux, languissant et funebre,
Qui pour moi seul a des charmes secrets.
Or, chaque fois que je viens a l'entendre,
De deux cents ans mon ame rajeunit;
C'est sous Louis treize ... et je crois voir s'etendre
Un coteau vert que le couchant jaunit.

Puis un chateau de brique a coins de pierres,
Aux vitraux teints de rougeatres couleurs,
Ceint de grands parcs, avec une riviere
Baignant ses pieds, qui coule entre les fleurs.
Puis une dame a sa haute fenetre,
Blonde, aux yeux noirs, en ses habits anciens....
Que dans une autre existence, peut-etre,
J'ai deja vue!... et dont je me souviens.


VERS DORES

Homme, libre penseur! te crois-tu seul pensant
Dans ce monde ou la vie eclate en toute chose?
Des forces que tu tiens ta liberte dispose,
Mais de tous tes conseils l'univers est absent.

Respecte dans la bete un esprit agissant.
Chaque fleur est une ame a la nature eclose;
Un mystere d'amour dans le metal repose.
"Tout est sensible!" et tout sur ton etre est puissant.

Crains, dans le mur aveugle, un regard qui t'epie;
A la matiere meme un verbe est attache....
Ne le fais pas servir a quelque usage impie!

Souvent, dans l'etre obscur habite un Dieu cache;
Et comme un oeil naissant couvert par ses paupieres,
Un pur esprit s'accroit sous l'ecorce des pierres.




HEGESIPPE MOREAU


LA FERMIERE

Amour a la fermiere! elle est
     Si gentille et si douce!
C'est l'oiseau des bois qui se plait
     Loin du bruit dans la mousse.
Vieux vagabond qui tends la main,
      Enfant pauvre et sans mere,
Puissiez-vous trouver en chemin
      La ferme et la fermiere!

De l'escabeau vide au foyer,
      La, le pauvre s'empare,
Et le grand bahut de noyer
      Pour lui n'est point avare;
C'est la qu'un jour je vins m'asseoir,
      Les pieds blancs de poussiere;
Un jour ... puis en marche! et bonsoir,
      La ferme et la fermiere!

Mon seul beau jour a du finir,
      Finir des son aurore;
Mais pour moi ce doux souvenir
      Est du bonheur encore:
En fermant les yeux, je revois
      L'enclos plein de lumiere,
La haie en fleur, le petit bois,
      La ferme et la fermiere!

Si Dieu, comme notre cure
      Au prone le repete,
Paie un bienfait (meme egare),
      Ah! qu'il songe a ma dette!
Qu'il prodigue au vallon les fleurs,
      La joie a la chaumiere,
Et garde des vents et des pleurs
      La ferme et la fermiere!

Chaque hiver, qu'un groupe d'enfants
      A son fuseau sourie,
Comme les anges aux fils blancs
      De la Vierge Marie;
Que tous, par la main, pas a pas,
      Guidant un petit frere,
Rejouissent de leurs ebats
      La ferme et la fermiere!

               ENVOI.

Ma chansonnette, prends ton vol!
      Tu n'es qu'un faible hommage;
Mais qu'en avril le rossignol
      Chante, et la dedommage;
Qu'effraye par ses chants d'amour,
      L'oiseau du cimetiere
Longtemps, longtemps, se taise pour
      La ferme et la fermiere!




ALFRED DE MUSSET


AU LECTEUR

Ce livre est toute ma jeunesse;
Je l'ai fait sans presque y songer.
Il y parait, je le confesse,
Et j'aurais pu le corriger.

Mais quand l'homme change sans cesse,
Au passe pourquoi rien changer?
Va-t'en, pauvre oiseau passager;
Que Dieu te mene a ton adresse!

Qui que tu sois, qui me liras,
Lis-en le plus que tu pourras,
Et ne me condamne qu'en somme.

Mes premiers vers sont d'un enfant,
Les seconds d'un adolescent,
Les derniers a peine d'un homme.


STANCES

Que j'aime a voir, dans la vallee
      Desolee,
Se lever comme un mausolee
Les quatre ailes d'un noir moutier!
Que j'aime a voir, pres de l'austere
      Monastere,
Au seuil du baron feudataire,
La croix blanche et le benitier!

Vous, des antiques Pyrenees
      Les ainees,
Vieilles eglises decharnees,
Maigres et tristes monuments,
Vous que le temps n'a pu dissoudre,
      Ni la foudre,
De quelques grands monts mis en poudre
N'etes-vous pas les ossements?

J'aime vos tours a tete grise,
      Ou se brise
L'eclair qui passe avec la brise.
J'aime vos profonds escaliers
Qui, tournoyant dans les entrailles
      Des murailles,
A l'hymne eclatant des ouailles
Font repondre tous les piliers!

Oh! lorsque l'ouragan qui gagne
      La campagne,
Prend par les cheveux la montagne,
Que le temps d'automne jaunit,
Que j'aime, dans le bois qui crie
      Et se plie,
Les vieux clochers de l'abbaye,
Comme deux arbres de granit!

Que j'aime a voir dans les vesprees
      Empourprees,
Jaillir en veines diaprees
Les rosaces d'or des couvents!
Oh! que j'aime, aux voutes gothiques
      Des portiques,
Les vieux saints de pierre athletiques
Priant tout bas pour les vivants!


LA NUIT DE MAI

LA MUSE.

Poete, prends ton luth et me donne un baiser;
La fleur de l'eglantier sent ses bourgeons eclore.
Le printemps nait ce soir; les vents vont s'embraser;
Et la bergeronnette, en attendant l'aurore,
Aux premiers buissons verts commence a se poser.
Poete, prends ton luth, et me donne un baiser.

LE POETE.

Comme il fait noir dans la vallee!
J'ai cru qu'une forme voilee
Flottait la-bas sur la foret.
Elle sortait de la prairie;
Son pied rasait l'herbe fleurie;
C'est une etrange reverie;
Elle s'efface et disparait.

LA MUSE.

Poete, prends ton luth; la nuit, sur la pelouse,
Balance le zephyr dans son voile odorant.
La rose, vierge encor, se referme jalouse
Sur le frelon nacre qu'elle enivre en mourant.
Ecoute! tout se tait; songe a ta bien-aimee.
Ce soir, sous les tilleuls, a la sombre ramee
Le rayon du couchant laisse un adieu plus doux.
Ce soir, tout va fleurir: l'immortelle nature
Se remplit de parfums, d'amour et de murmure
Comme le lit joyeux de deux jeunes epoux.

LE POETE.

Pourquoi mon coeur bat-il si vite?
Qu'ai-je donc en moi qui s'agite
Dont je me sens epouvante?
Ne frappe-t-on pas a ma porte?
Pourquoi ma lampe a demi morte
M'eblouit-elle de clarte?
Dieu puissant! tout mon corps frissonne.
Qui vient? qui m'appelle?--Personne.
Je suis seul; c'est l'heure qui sonne;
O solitude! o pauvrete!

LA MUSE.

Poete, prends ton luth; le vin de la jeunesse
Fermente cette nuit dans les veines de Dieu.
Mon sein est inquiet; la volupte l'oppresse,
Et les vents alteres m'ont mis la levre en feu.
O paresseux enfant! regarde, je suis belle.
Notre premier baiser, ne t'en souviens-tu pas,
Quand je te vis si pale au toucher de mon aile,
Et que, les yeux en pleurs, tu tombas dans mes bras?
Ah! je t'ai console d'une amere souffrance!
Helas! bien jeune encor, tu te mourais d'amour.
Console-moi ce soir, je me meurs d'esperance;
J'ai besoin de prier pour vivre jusqu'au jour.

LE POETE.

Est-ce toi dont la voix m'appelle,
O ma pauvre Muse! est-ce toi?
O ma fleur! o mon immortelle!
Seul etre pudique et fidele
Ou vive encor l'amour de moi!
Oui, te voila, c'est toi, ma blonde,
C'est toi, ma maitresse et ma soeur!
Et je sens, dans la nuit profonde,
De ta robe d'or qui m'inonde
Les rayons glisser dans mon coeur.

LA MUSE.

Poete, prends ton luth; c'est moi, ton immortelle,
Qui t'ai vu cette nuit triste et silencieux,
Et qui, comme un oiseau que sa couvee appelle,
Pour pleurer avec toi descends du haut des cieux.
Viens, tu souffres, ami. Quelque ennui solitaire
Te ronge, quelque chose a gemi dans ton coeur;
Quelque amour t'est venu, comme on en voit sur terre,
Une ombre de plaisir, un semblant de bonheur.
Viens, chantons devant Dieu; chantons dans tes pensees;
Dans tes plaisirs perdus, dans tes peines passees;
Partons, dans un baiser, pour un monde inconnu.
Eveillons au hasard les echos de ta vie,
Parlons-nous de bonheur, de gloire et de folie,

Et que ce soit un reve, et le premier venu.
Inventons quelque part des lieux ou l'on oublie;
Partons, nous sommes seuls, l'univers est a nous.
Voici la verte Ecosse et la brune Italie,
Et la Grece, ma mere, ou le miel est si doux,
Argos, et Pteleon, ville des hecatombes,
Et Messa, la divine, agreable aux colombes;
Et le front chevelu du Pelion changeant;
Et le bleu Titarese, et le golfe d'argent
Qui montre dans ses eaux, ou le cygne se mire,
La blanche Oloossone a la blanche Camyre.
Dis-moi, quel songe d'or nos chants vont-ils bercer?
D'ou vont venir les pleurs que nous allons verser?
Ce matin, quand le jour a frappe ta paupiere,
Quel seraphin pensif, courbe sur ton chevet,
Secouait des lilas dans sa robe legere,
Et te contait tout bas les amours qu'il revait?
Chanterons-nous l'espoir, la tristesse ou la joie?
Tremperons nous de sang les bataillons d'acier?
Suspendrons-nous l'amant sur l'echelle de soie?
Jetterons-nous au vent l'ecume du coursier?
Dirons-nous quelle main, dans les lampes sans nombre
De la maison celeste, allume nuit et jour
L'huile sainte de vie et d'eternel amour
Crierons-nous a Tarquin: "Il est temps, voici l'ombre!"
Descendrons-nous cueillir la perle au fond des mers?
Menerons-nous la chevre aux ebeniers amers?
Montrerons-nous le ciel a la Melancolie?
Suivrons-nous le chasseur sur les monts escarpes?
La biche le regarde; elle pleure et supplie;
Sa bruyere l'attend; ses faons sont nouveau-nes;
Il se baisse, il l'egorge, il jette a la curee
Sur les chiens en sueur son coeur encor vivant.
Peindrons-nous une vierge a la joue empourpree,
S'en allant a la messe, un page la suivant,
Et d'un regard distrait, a cote de sa mere,
Sur sa levre entr'ouverte oubliant sa priere?
Elle ecoute en tremblant, dans l'echo du pilier,
Resonner l'eperon d'un hardi cavalier.
Dirons-nous aux heros des vieux temps de la France
De monter tout armes aux creneaux de leurs tours,
Et de ressusciter la naive romance
Que leur gloire oubliee apprit aux troubadours?
Vetirons-nous de blanc une molle elegie?
L'homme de Waterloo nous dira-t-il sa vie,
Et ce qu'il a fauche du troupeau des humains
Avant que l'envoye de la nuit eternelle
Vint sur son tertre vert l'abattre d'un coup d'aile,
Et sur son coeur de fer lui croiser les deux mains?
Clouerons-nous au poteau d'une satire altiere
Le nom sept fois vendu d'un pale pamphletaire,
Qui, pousse par la faim, du fond de son oubli,
S'en vient, tout grelottant d'envie et d'impuissance,
Sur le front du genie insulter l'esperance,
Et mordre le laurier que son souffle a sali?
Prends ton luth! prends ton luth! je ne peux plus me taire;
Mon aile me souleve au souffle du printemps.
Le vent va m'emporter; je vais quitter la terre.
Une larme de toi! Dieu m'ecoute; il est temps.

LE POETE.

S'il ne te faut, ma soeur cherie,
Qu'un baiser d'une levre amie
Et qu'une larme de mes yeux,
Je te les donnerai sans peine;
De nos amours qu'il te souvienne,
Si tu remontes dans les cieux.
Je ne chante ni l'esperance,
Ni la gloire, ni le bonheur,
Helas! pas meme la souffrance.
La bouche garde le silence
Pour ecouter parler le coeur.

LA MUSE.

Crois-tu donc que je sois comme le vent d'automne,
Qui se nourrit de pleurs jusque sur un tombeau,
Et pour qui la douleur n'est qu'une goutte d'eau?
O poete! un baiser, c'est moi qui te le donne.
L'herbe que je voulais arracher de ce lieu.
C'est ton oisivete; ta douleur est a Dieu.
Quel que soit le souci que ta jeunesse endure,
Laisse-la s'elargir, cette sainte blessure
Que les noirs seraphins t'ont faite au fond du coeur;
Rien ne nous rend si grands qu'une grande douleur.
Mais, pour en etre atteint, ne crois pas, o poete,
Que ta voix ici-bas doive rester muette.
Les plus desesperes sont les chants les plus beaux,
Et j'en sais d'immortels qui sont de purs sanglots.
Lorsque le pelican, lasse d'un long voyage,
Dans les brouillards du soir retourne a ses roseaux,
Ses petits affames courent sur le rivage
En le voyant au loin s'abattre sur les eaux.
Deja, croyant saisir et partager leur proie,
Ils courent a leur pere avec des cris de joie
En secouant leurs becs sur leurs goitres hideux.
Lui, gagnant a pas lents une roche elevee,
De son aile pendante abritant sa couvee,
Pecheur melancolique, il regarde les cieux.
Le sang coule a longs flots de sa poitrine ouverte;
En vain il a des mers fouille la profondeur:
L'Ocean etait vide et la plage deserte;
Pour toute nourriture il apporte son coeur.
Sombre et silencieux, etendu sur la pierre,
Partageant a ses fils ses entrailles de pere,
Dans son amour sublime il berce sa douleur,
Et, regardant couler sa sanglante mamelle,
Sur son festin de mort il s'affaisse et chancelle,
Ivre de volupte, de tendresse et d'horreur.
Mais parfois, au milieu du divin sacrifice,
Fatigue de mourir dans un trop long supplice,
Il craint que ses enfants ne le laissent vivant;

Alors il se souleve, ouvre son aile au vent,
Et se frappant le coeur avec un cri sauvage,
Il pousse dans la nuit un si funebre adieu,
Que les oiseaux de mer desertent le rivage,
Et que le voyageur attarde sur la plage,
Sentant passer la mort, se recommande a Dieu.
Poete, c'est ainsi que font les grands poetes.
Ils laissent s'egayer ceux qui vivent un temps;
Mais les festins humains qu'ils servent a leurs fetes
Ressemblent la plupart a ceux des pelicans.
Quand ils parlent ainsi d'esperances trompees,
De tristesse et d'oubli, d'amour et de malheur,
Ce n'est pas un concert a dilater le coeur.
Leurs declamations sont comme des epees:
Elles tracent dans l'air un cercle eblouissant,
Mais il y pend toujours quelque goutte de sang.

LE POETE.

O Muse! spectre insatiable,
Ne m'en demande pas si long.
L'homme n'ecrit rien sur le sable
A l'heure ou passe l'aquilon.
J'ai vu le temps ou ma jeunesse
Sur mes levres etait sans cesse
Prete a chanter comme un oiseau;
Mais j'ai souffert un dur martyre,
Et le moins que j'en pourrais dire,
Si je l'essayais sur ma lyre,
La briserait comme un roseau.


LA NUIT DE DECEMBRE

Du temps que j'etais ecolier,
Je restais un soir a veiller

Dans notre salle solitaire.
Devant ma table vint s'asseoir
Un pauvre enfant vetu de noir,
Qui me ressemblait comme un frere.

Son visage etait triste et beau:
A la lueur de mon flambeau,
Dans mon livre ouvert il vint lire.
Il pencha son front sur ma main,
Et resta jusqu'au lendemain,
Pensif, avec un doux sourire.

Comme j'allais avoir quinze ans,
Je marchais un jour, a pas lents,
Dans un bois, sur une bruyere.
Au pied d'un arbre vint s'asseoir
Un jeune homme vetu de noir,
Qui me ressemblait comme un frere.

Je lui demandai mon chemin;
Il tenait un luth d'une main,
De l'autre un bouquet d'eglantine.
Il me fit un salut d'ami,
Et, se detournant a demi,
Me montra du doigt la colline.

A l'age ou l'on croit a l'amour,
J'etais seul dans ma chambre un jour,
Pleurant ma premiere misere.
Au coin de mon feu vint s'asseoir
Un etranger vetu de noir,
Qui me ressemblait comme un frere.

Il etait morne et soucieux;
D'une main il montrait les cieux,
Et de l'autre il tenait un glaive.
De ma peine il semblait souffrir,
Mais il ne poussa qu'un soupir,
Et s'evanouit comme un reve.

A l'age ou l'on est libertin,
Pour boire un toast en un festin,
Un jour je soulevai mon verre.
En face de moi vint s'asseoir
Un convive vetu de noir,
Qui me ressemblait comme un frere.

Il secouait sous son manteau
Un haillon de pourpre en lambeau,
Sur sa tete un myrte sterile.
Son bras maigre cherchait le mien,
Et mon verre, en touchant le sien,
Se brisa dans ma main debile.

Un an apres, il etait nuit,
J'etais a genoux pres du lit
Ou venait de mourir mon pere.
Au chevet du lit vint s'asseoir
Un orphelin vetu de noir,
Qui me ressemblait comme un frere.

Ses yeux etaient noyes de pleurs;
Comme les anges de douleurs,
Il etait couronne d'epine;
Son luth a terre etait gisant,
Sa pourpre de couleur de sang,
Et son glaive dans sa poitrine.

Je m'en suis si bien souvenu,
Que je l'ai toujours reconnu
A tous les instants de ma vie.
C'est une etrange vision,
Et cependant, ange ou demon,
J'ai vu partout cette ombre amie.

Lorsque plus tard, las de souffrir,
Pour renaitre ou pour en finir,
J'ai voulu m'exiler de France;
Lorsqu' impatient de marcher,
J'ai voulu partir, et chercher
Les vestiges d'une esperance;

A Pise, au pied de l'Apennin;
A Cologne, en face du Rhin ;
A Nice, au penchant des vallees;
A Florence, au fond des palais;
A Brigues, dans les vieux chalets;
Au sein des Alpes desolees;

A Genes sous les citronniers;
A Vevay, sous les verts pommiers;
Au Havre, devant l'Atlantique;
A Venise, a l'affreux Lido,
Ou vient sur l'herbe d'un tombeau
Mourir la pale Adriatique;

Partout ou, sous ces vastes cieux,
J'ai lasse mon coeur et mes yeux,
Saignant d'une eternelle plaie;
Partout ou le boiteux Ennui,
Trainant ma fatigue apres lui,
M'a promene sur une claie;

Partout ou, sans cesse altere
De la soif d'un monde ignore,
J'ai suivi l'ombre de mes songes;
Partout ou, sans avoir vecu,
J'ai revu ce que j'avais vu,
La face humaine et ses mensonges;

Partout ou, le long des chemins,
J'ai pose mon front dans mes mains.
Et sanglote comme une femme;
Partout ou j'ai, comme un mouton.
Qui laisse sa laine au buisson,
Senti se denuer mon ame;

Partout ou j'ai voulu dormir,
Partout ou j'ai voulu mourir,
Partout ou j'ai touche la terre,
Sur ma route est venu s'asseoir
Un malheureux vetu de noir,
Qui me ressemblait comme un frere.

Qui donc es-tu, toi que dans cette vie
     Je vois toujours sur mon chemin?
Je ne puis croire, a ta melancolie,
     Que tu sois mon mauvais Destin.
Ton doux sourire a trop de patience,
     Tes larmes ont trop de pitie.
En te voyant, j'aime la Providence.
Ta douleur meme est soeur de ma souffrance;
     Elle ressemble a l'Amitie.

Qui donc es-tu?--Tu n'es pas mon bon ange;
     Jamais tu ne viens m'avertir.
Tu vois mes maux (c'est une chose etrange!),
     Et tu me regardes souffrir.
Depuis vingt ans tu marches dans ma voie,
     Et je ne saurais t'appeler.
Qui donc es-tu, si c'est Dieu qui t'envoie?
Tu me souris sans partager ma joie,
     Tu me plains sans me consoler!

Ce soir encor je t'ai vu m'apparaitre.
     C'etait par une triste nuit.
L'aile des vents battait a ma fenetre;
     J'etais seul, courbe sur mon lit.
J'y regardais une place cherie,
     Tiede encor d'un baiser brulant;
Et je songeais comme la femme oublie,
Et je sentais un lambeau de ma vie,
     Qui se dechirait lentement.

Je rassemblais des lettres de la veille,

     Des cheveux, des debris d'amour.
Tout ce passe me criait a l'oreille
     Ses eternels serments d'un jour.
Je contemplais ces reliques sacrees,
     Qui me faisaient trembler la main ;
Larmes du coeur par le coeur devorees,
Et que les yeux qui les avaient pleurees
     Ne reconnaitront plus demain!

J'enveloppais dans un morceau de bure
     Ces ruines des jours heureux.
Je me disais qu'ici-bas ce qui dure,
     C'est une meche de cheveux.
Comme un plongeur dans une mer profonde,
     Je me perdais dans tant d'oubli.
De tous cotes j'y retournais la sonde,
Et je pleurais seul, loin des yeux du monde,
     Mon pauvre amour enseveli.

J'allais poser le sceau de cire noire
      Sur ce fragile et cher tresor.
J'allais le rendre, et n'y pouvant pas croire,
      En pleurant j'en doutais encor.
Ah! faible femme, orgueilleuse insensee,
      Malgre toi, tu t'en souviendras!
Pourquoi, grand Dieu! mentir a sa pensee?
Pourquoi ces pleurs, cette gorge oppressee,
      Ces sanglots, si tu n'aimais pas?

Oui, tu languis, tu souffres, et tu pleures;
      Mais ta chimere est entre nous.
Eh bien, adieu! Vous compterez les heures
      Qui me separeront de vous.
Partez, partez, et dans ce coeur de glace
      Emportez l'orgueil satisfait.
Je sens encor le mien jeune et vivace,
Et bien des maux pourront y trouver place
      Sur le mal que vous m'avez fait.

Partez, partez! la Nature immortelle
      N'a pas tout voulu nous donner.
Ah! pauvre enfant, qui voulez etre belle,
      Et ne savez pas pardonner!
Allez, allez, suivez la destinee;
      Qui vous perd n'a pas tout perdu.
Jetez au vent notre amour consumee;--
Eternel Dieu! toi que j'ai tant aimee,
      Si tu pars, pourquoi m'aimes-tu?

Mais tout a coup j'ai vu dans la nuit sombre
      Une forme glisser sans bruit.
Sur mon rideau j'ai vu passer une ombre;
      Elle vient s'asseoir sur mon lit.
Qui donc es-tu, morne et pale visage,
      Sombre portrait vetu de noir?
Que me veux-tu, triste oiseau de passage?
Est-ce un vain reve? est-ce ma propre image
      Que j'apercois dans ce miroir?

Qui donc es-tu, spectre de ma jeunesse,
      Pelerin que rien n'a lasse?
Dis-moi pourquoi je te trouve sans cesse
      Assis dans l'ombre ou j'ai passe.
Qui donc es-tu, visiteur solitaire,
      Hote assidu de mes douleurs?
Qu'as-tu donc fait pour me suivre sur terre?
Qui donc es-tu, qui donc es-tu, mon frere,
      Qui n'apparais qu'au jour des pleurs?


LA VISION.

Ami, notre pere est le tien.
Je ne suis ni l'ange gardien,
Ni le mauvais destin des hommes.
Ceux que j'aime, je ne sais pas
De quel cote s'en vont leurs pas
Sur ce peu de fange ou nous sommes.

Je ne suis ni dieu ni demon,
Et tu m'as nomme par mon nom
Quand tu m'as appele ton frere;
Ou tu vas, j'y serai toujours,
Jusques au dernier de tes jours,
Ou j'irai m'asseoir sur ta pierre.
Le ciel m'a confie ton coeur.
Quand tu seras dans la douleur,

Viens a moi sans inquietude,
Je te suivrai sur le chemin;
Mais je ne puis toucher ta main;
Ami, je suis la Solitude.


STANCES A LA MALIBRAN

Sans doute il est trop tard pour parier encor d'elle;
Depuis qu'elle n'est plus quinze jours sont passes,
Et dans ce pays-ci quinze jours, je le sais,
Font d'une mort recente une vieille nouvelle.
De quelque nom d'ailleurs que le regret s'appelle,
L'homme, par tout pays, en a bien vite assez.

O Maria-Felicia! le peintre et le poete
Laissent, en expirant, d'immortels heritiers;
Jamais l'affreuse nuit ne les prend tout entiers.
A defaut d'action, leur grande ame inquiete
De la mort et du temps entreprend la conquete,
Et, frappes dans la lutte, ils tombent en guerriers.

Celui-la sur l'airain a grave sa pensee;
Dans un rhythme dore l'autre l'a cadencee;
Du moment qu'on l'ecoute, on lui devient ami.
Sur sa toile, en mourant, Raphael l'a laissee;
Et, pour que le neant ne touche point a lui,
C'est assez d'un enfant sur sa mere endormi.

Comme dans une lampe une flamme fidele,
Au fond du Parthenon le marbre inhabite
Garde de Phidias la memoire eternelle,
Et la jeune Venus, fille de Praxitele,
Sourit encor, debout dans sa divinite,
Aux siecles impuissants qu'a vaincus sa beaute.

Recevant d'age en age une nouvelle vie,
Ainsi s'en vont a Dieu les gloires d'autrefois;
Ainsi le vaste echo de la voix du genie
Devient du genre humain l'universelle voix....
Et de toi, morte hier, de toi, pauvre Marie,
Au fond d'une chapelle il nous reste une croix!

Une croix! et l'oubli, la nuit et le silence!
Ecoutez! c'est le vent, c'est l'Ocean immense;
C'est un pecheur qui chante au bord du grand chemin.
Et de tant de beaute, de gloire et d'esperance,
De tant d'accords si doux d'un instrument divin,
Pas un faible soupir, pas un echo lointain!

Une croix, et ton nom ecrit sur une pierre,

Non pas meme le tien, mais celui d'un epoux,
Voila ce qu'apres toi tu laisses sur la terre;
Et ceux qui t'iront voir a ta maison derniere,
N'y trouvant pas ce nom qui fut aime de nous,
Ne sauront pour prier ou poser les genoux.

O Ninette! ou sont-ils, belle muse adoree,
Ces accents pleins d'amour, de charme et de terreur,
Qui voltigeaient le soir sur ta levre inspiree,
Comme un parfum leger sur l'aubepine en fleur?
Ou vibre maintenant cette voix eploree,
Cette harpe vivante attachee a ton coeur?


N'etait-ce pas hier, fille joyeuse et folle,
Que ta verve railleuse animait Corilla,
Et que tu nous lancais avec la Rosina
La roulade amoureuse et l'oeillade espagnole ?
Ces pleurs sur tes bras nus, quand tu chantais _le Saule_,
N'etait-ce pas hier, pale Desdemona?

N'etait-ce pas hier qu'a la fleur de ton age
Tu traversais l'Europe, une lyre a la main;
Dans la mer, en riant, te jetant a la nage,
Chantant la tarentelle au ciel napolitain,
Coeur d'ange et de lion, libre oiseau de passage,
Espiegle enfant ce soir, sainte artiste demain?

N'etait-ce pas hier qu'enivree et benie
Tu trainais a ton char un peuple transporte,
Et que Londre et Madrid, la France et l'Italie
Apportaient a tes pieds cet or tant convoite,
Cet or deux fois sacre qui payait ton genie,
Et qu'a tes pieds souvent laissa ta charite?

Qu'as-tu fait pour mourir, o noble creature,
Belle image de Dieu, qui donnais en chemin
Au riche un peu de joie, au malheureux du pain?
Ah! qui donc frappe ainsi dans la mere nature,
Et quel faucheur aveugle, affame de pature,
Sur les meilleurs de nous ose porter la main?

Ne suffit-il donc pas a l'ange des tenebres
Qu'a peine de ce temps il nous reste un grand nom?
Que Gericault, Cuvier, Schiller, Goethe et Byron
Soient endormis d'hier sous les dalles funebres,
Et que nous ayons vu tant d'autres morts celebres
Dans l'abime entr'ouvert suivre Napoleon?

Nous faut-il perdre encor nos tetes les plus cheres,
Et venir en pleurant leur fermer les paupieres,
Des qu'un rayon d'espoir a brille dans leurs yeux?
Le ciel de ses elus devient-il envieux?
Ou faut-il croire, helas! ce que disaient nos peres,
Que lorsqu'on meurt si jeune on est aime des dieux?

Ah! combien, depuis peu, sont partis pleins de vie!
Sous les cypres anciens que de saules nouveaux!
La cendre de Robert a peine refroidie,
Bellini tombe et meurt!--Une lente agonie
Traine Carrel sanglant a l'eternel repos.
Le seuil de notre siecle est pave de tombeaux.

Que nous restera-t-il si l'ombre insatiable,
Des que nous batissons, vient tout ensevelir?
Nous qui sentons deja le sol si variable,
Et, sur tant de debris, marchons vers l'avenir,
Si le vent, sous nos pas, balaye ainsi le sable,
De quel deuil le Seigneur veut-il donc nous vetir?

Helas! Marietta, tu nous restais encore.
Lorsque, sur le sillon, l'oiseau chante a l'aurore,
Le laboureur s'arrete, et, le front en sueur,
Aspire dans l'air pur un souffle de bonheur.
Ainsi nous consolait ta voix fraiche et sonore,
Et tes chants dans les cieux emportaient la douleur.

Ce qu'il nous faut pleurer sur ta tombe hative,
Ce n'est pas l'art divin, ni ses savants secrets:
Quelque autre etudiera cet art que tu creais;
C'est ton ame, Ninette, et ta grandeur naive,
C'est cette voix du coeur qui seule au coeur arrive,
Que nul autre, apres toi, ne nous rendra jamais.

Ah! tu vivrais encor sans cette ame indomptable.
Ce fut la ton seul mal, et le secret fardeau
Sous lequel ton beau corps plia comme un roseau.
Il en soutint longtemps la lutte inexorable.
C'est le Dieu tout-puissant, c'est la Muse implacable
Qui dans ses bras en feu t'a portee au tombeau.

Que ne l'etouffais-tu, cette flamme brulante
Que ton sein palpitant ne pouvait contenir!
Tu vivrais, tu verrais te suivre et t'applaudir
De ce public blase la foule indifferente,
Qui prodigue aujourd'hui sa faveur inconstante
A des gens dont pas un, certes, n'en doit mourir.

Connaissais-tu si peu l'ingratitude humaine?
Quel reve as-tu donc fait de te tuer pour eux!
Quelques bouquets de fleurs te rendaient-ils si vaine,
Pour venir nous verser de vrais pleurs sur la scene,
Lorsque tant d'histrions et d'artistes fameux,
Couronnes mille fois, n'en ont pas dans les yeux?

Que ne detournais-tu la tete pour sourire,
Comme on en use ici quand on feint d'etre emu?
Helas! on t'aimait tant, qu'on n'en aurait rien vu.
Quand tu chantais _le Saule_, au lieu de ce delire,
Que ne t'occupais-tu de bien porter ta lyre?
La Pasta fait ainsi: que ne l'imitais-tu?

Ne savais-tu donc pas, comedienne imprudente,
Que ces cris insenses qui te sortaient du coeur
De ta joue amaigrie augmentaient la paleur?
Ne savais-tu donc pas que, sur ta tempe ardente,
Ta main de jour en jour se posait plus tremblante,
Et que c'est tenter Dieu que d'aimer la douleur?

Ne sentais-tu donc pas que ta belle jeunesse
De tes yeux fatigues s'ecoulait en ruisseaux,
Et de ton noble coeur s'exhalait en sanglots?
Quand de ceux qui t'aimaient tu voyais la tristesse,
Ne sentais-tu donc pas qu'une fatale ivresse
Bercait ta vie errante a ses derniers rameaux?

Oui, oui, tu le savais, qu'au sortir du theatre,
Un soir dans ton linceul il faudrait te coucher.
Lorsqu'on te rapportait plus froide que l'albatre,
Lorsque le medecin, de ta veine bleuatre,
Regardait goutte a goutte un sang noir s'epancher,
Tu savais quelle main venait de te toucher.

Oui, oui, tu le savais, et que, dans cette vie,
Rien n'est bon que d'aimer, n'est vrai que de souffrir.
Chaque soir dans tes chants tu te sentais palir.
Tu connaissais le monde, et la foule et l'envie,
Et, dans ce corps brise concentrant ton genie,
Tu regardais aussi la Malibran mourir.

Meurs donc! ta mort est douce et ta tache est remplie
Ce que l'homme ici-bas appelle le genie,
C'est le besoin d'aimer; hors de la tout est vain.
Et, puisque tot ou tard l'amour humain s'oublie,
Il est d'une grande ame et d'un heureux destin
D'expirer comme toi pour un amour divin!


CHANSON DE BARBERINE

Beau chevalier qui partez pour la guerre,
    Qu'allez-vous faire
    Si loin d'ici?
Voyez-vous pas que la nuit est profonde.
    Et que le monde
    N'est que souci?

Vous qui croyez qu'une amour delaissee
    De la pensee
    S'enfuit ainsi,
Helas! helas! chercheurs de renommee,
    Votre fumee
    S'envole aussi.

Beau chevalier qui partez pour la guerre,
    Qu'allez-vous faire
    Si loin de nous?
J'en vais pleurer, moi qui me laissais dire
    Que mon sourire
    Etait si doux.


CHANSON DE FORTUNIO

Si vous croyez que je vais dire
     Qui j'ose aimer,
Je ne saurais, pour un empire,
     Vous la nommer.

Nous allons chanter a la ronde,
     Si vous voulez,
Que je l'adore et qu'elle est blonde
     Comme les bles.

Je fais ce que sa fantaisie
     Veut m'ordonner,
Et je puis, s'il lui faut ma vie,
     La lui donner.

Du mal qu'une amour ignoree
     Nous fait souffrir,
J'en porte l'ame dechiree
     Jusqu'a mourir.

Mais j'aime trop pour que je die
     Qui j'ose aimer,
Et je veux mourir pour ma mie
     Sans la nommer.


TRISTESSE

J'ai perdu ma force et ma vie,
Et mes amis et ma gaite;
J'ai perdu jusqu' a la fierte
Qui faisait croire a mon genie.

Quand j'ai connu la Verite,
J'ai cru que c'etait une amie;
Quand je l'ai comprise et sentie,
J'en etais deja degoute.

Et pourtant elle est eternelle,
Et ceux qui se sont passes d'elle
Ici-bas ont tout ignore.

Dieu parle, il faut qu'on lui reponde;
Le seul bien qui me reste au monde
Est d'avoir quelquefois pleure.


RAPPELLE-TOI

(Vergiss mein nicht.)

PAROLES FAITES SUR LA MUSIQUE DE MOZART.

    Rapelle-toi, quand l'Aurore craintive
    Ouvre au Soleil son palais enchante;
    Rappelle-toi, lorsque la nuit pensive
    Passe en revant sous son voile argente;
A l'appel du plaisir lorsque ton sein palpite,
Aux doux songes du soir lorsque l'ombre t'invite.
        Ecoute au fond des bois
        Murmurer une voix:
            Rappelle-toi.

    Rappelle-toi, lorsque les destinees
    M'auront de toi pour jamais separe,
    Quand le chagrin, l'exil et les annees
    Auront fletri ce coeur desespere;
Songe a mon triste amour, songe a l'adieu supreme!
L'absence ni le temps ne sont rien quand on aime.
        Tant que mon coeur battra,
        Toujours il te dira:
            Rappelle-toi.

    Rappelle-toi, quand sous la froide terre
    Mon coeur brise pour toujours dormira;
    Rappelle-toi, quand la fleur solitaire
    Sur mon tombeau doucement s'ouvrira.
Je ne te verrai plus; mais mon ame immortelle
Reviendra pres de toi comme une soeur fidele.
        Ecoute, dans la nuit,
        Une voix qui gemit:
            Rappelle-toi.


SOUVENIR

J'esperais bien pleurer, mais je croyais souffrir
En osant te revoir, place a jamais sacree,
O la plus chere tombe et la plus ignoree
               Ou dorme un souvenir!

Que redoutiez-vous donc de cette solitude,
Et pourquoi, mes amis, me preniez-vous la main?
Alors qu'une si douce et si vieille habitude
               Me montrait ce chemin?

Les voila, ces coteaux, ces bruyeres fleuries,
Et ces pas argentins sur le sable muet,
Ces sentiers amoureux, remplis de causeries,
               Ou son bras m'enlacait.


Les voila, ces sapins a la sombre verdure,
Cette gorge profonde aux nonchalants detours,
Ces sauvages amis, dont l'antique murmure
               A berce mes beaux jours.

Les voila, ces buissons ou toute ma jeunesse,
Comme un essaim d'oiseaux, chante au bruit de mes pas.
Lieux charmants, beau desert ou passa ma maitresse,
               Ne m'attendiez-vous pas?


Ah! laissez-les couler, elles me sont bien cheres,
Ces larmes que souleve un coeur encor blesse!
Ne les essuyez pas, laissez sur mes paupieres
               Ce voile du passe!

Je ne viens point jeter un regret inutile
Dans l'echo de ces bois temoins de mon bonheur.
Fiere est cette foret dans sa beaute tranquille,
               Et fier aussi mon coeur.

Que celui-la se livre a des plaintes ameres,
Qui s'agenouille et prie au tombeau d'un ami.
Tout respire en ces lieux; les fleurs des cimetieres
               Ne poussent point ici.

Voyez! la lune monte a travers ces ombrages.
Ton regard tremble encor, belle reine des nuits;
Mais du sombre horizon deja tu te degages,
               Et tu t'epanouis.

Ainsi de cette terre, humide encor de pluie,
Sortent, sous tes rayons, tous les parfums du jour;
Aussi calme, aussi pur, de mon ame attendrie
Sort mon ancien amour.

Que sont-ils devenus, les chagrins de ma vie?
Tout ce qui m'a fait vieux est bien loin maintenant;
Et rien qu'en regardant cette vallee amie,
               Je redeviens enfant.

O puissance du temps! o legeres annees!
Vous emportez nos pleurs, nos cris et nos regrets;
Mais la pitie vous prend, et sur nos fleurs fanees
               Vous ne marchez jamais.

Tout mon coeur te benit, bonte consolatrice!
Je n'aurais jamais cru que l'on put tant souffrir
D'une telle blessure, et que sa cicatrice
               Fut si douce a sentir.

Loin de moi les vains mots, les frivoles pensees,
Des vulgaires douleurs linceul accoutume,
Que viennent etaler sur leurs amours passees
               Ceux qui n'ont point aime!

Dante, pourquoi dis-tu qu'il n'est pire misere
Qu'un souvenir heureux dans les jours de douleur?
Quel chagrin t'a dicte cette parole amere,
               Cette offense au malheur?

En est-il donc moins vrai que la lumiere existe,
Et faut-il l'oublier du moment qu'il fait nuit?
Est-ce bien toi, grande ame immortellement triste,
               Est-ce toi qui l'as dit?

Non, par ce pur flambeau dont la splendeur m'eclaire,
Ce blaspheme vante ne vient pas de ton coeur.
Un souvenir heureux est peut-etre sur terre
               Plus vrai que le bonheur.

Eh quoi! l'infortune qui trouve une etincelle
Dans la cendre brulante ou dorment ses ennuis,
Qui saisit cette flamme et qui fixe sur elle
               Ses regards eblouis;

Dans ce passe perdu quand son ame se noie,
Sur ce miroir brise lorsqu'il reve en pleurant,
Tu lui dis qu'il se trompe, et que sa faible joie
               N'est qu'un affreux tourment!

Et c'est a ta Francoise, a ton ange de gloire,
Que tu pouvais donner ces mots a prononcer,
Elle qui s'interrompt, pour conter son histoire,
               D'un eternel baiser!

Qu'est-ce donc, juste Dieu, que la pensee humaine,
Et qui pourra jamais aimer la verite,
S'il n'est joie ou douleur si juste et si certaine
               Dont quelqu'un n'ait doute?

Comment vivez-vous donc, etranges creatures?
Vous riez, vous chantez, vous marchez a grands pas;
Le ciel et sa beaute, le monde et ses souillures
               Ne vous derangent pas;

Mais, lorsque par hasard le destin vous ramene

Vers quelque monument d'un amour oublie,
Ce caillou vous arrete, et cela vous fait peine
               Qu'il vous heurte le pie.

Et vous criez alors que la vie est un songe;
Vous vous tordez les bras comme en vous reveillant,
Et vous trouvez facheux qu'un si joyeux mensonge
               Ne dure qu'un instant.

Malheureux! cet instant ou votre ame engourdie
A secoue les fers qu'elle traine ici-bas,
Ce fugitif instant fut toute votre vie;
               Ne le regrettez pas!

Regrettez la torpeur qui vous cloue a la terre,
Vos agitations dans la fange et le sang,
Vos nuits sans esperance et vos jours sans lumiere:
               C'est la qu'est le neant!

Mais que vous revient-il de vos froides doctrines?
Que demandent au ciel ces regrets inconstants
Que vous allez semant sur vos propres ruines,
               A chaque pas du Temps?

Oui, sans doute, tout meurt; ce monde est un grand reve,
Et le peu de bonheur qui nous vient en chemin,
Nous n'avons pas plus tot ce roseau dans la main,
               Que le vent nous l'enleve.

Oui, les premiers baisers, oui,les premiers serments
Que deux etres mortels echangerent sur terre,
Ce fut au pied d'un arbre effeuille par les vents,
               Sur un roc en poussiere.

Ils prirent a temoin de leur joie ephemere
Un ciel toujours voile qui change a tout moment,
Et des astres sans nom que leur propre lumiere
               Devore incessamment.

Tout mourait autour d'eux, l'oiseau dans le feuillage,
La fleur entre leurs mains, l'insecte sous leurs pies,
La source dessechee ou vacillait l'image
               De leurs traits oublies;

Et sut tous ces debris joignant leurs mains d'argile.
Etourdis des eclairs d'un instant de plaisir,
Ils croyaient echapper a cet Etre immobile
               Qui regarde mourir!

--Insenses! dit le sage.--Heureux! dit le poete.
Et quels tristes amours as-tu donc dans le coeur,
Si le bruit du torrent te trouble et t'inquiete,
               Si le vent te fait peur?

J'ai vu sous le soleil tomber bien d'autres choses
Que les feuilles des bois et l'ecume des eaux,
Bien d'autres s'en aller que le parfum des roses
               Et le chant des oiseaux.

Mes yeux ont contemple des objets plus funebres
Que Juliette morte au fond de son tombeau,
Plus affreux que le toast a l'ange des tenebres
               Porte par Romeo.

J'ai vu ma seule amie, a jamais la plus chere,
Devenue elle-meme un sepulcre blanchi,
Une tombe vivante ou flottait la poussiere
               De notre mort cheri,

De notre pauvre amour, que, dans la nuit profonde,
Nous avions sur nos coeurs si doucement berce!
C'etait plus qu'une vie, helas! c'etait un monde
               Qui s'etait efface!

Oui, jeune et belle encor, plus belle, osait-on dire,
Je l'ai vue, et ses yeux brillaient comme autrefois.
Ses levres s'entr'ouvraient, et c'etait un sourire,
               Et c'etait une voix;

Mais non plus cette voix, non plus ce doux langage,
Ces regards adores dans les miens confondus;
Mon coeur, encor plein d'elle, errait sur son visage,
               Et ne la trouvait plus.

Et pourtant j'aurais pu marcher alors vers elle;
Entourer de mes bras ce sein vide et glace,
Et j'aurais pu crier: "Qu'as-tu fait, infidele,
               Qu'as-tu fait du passe?"

Mais non : il me semblait qu'une femme inconnue
Avait pris par hasard cette voix et ces yeux;
Et je laissai passer cette froide statue
               En regardant les cieux.

Eh bien! ce fut sans doute une horrible misere
Que ce riant adieu d'un etre inanime.
Eh bien! qu'importe encore? O nature! o ma mere!
               En ai-je moins aime?

La foudre maintenant peut tomber sur ma tete;
Jamais ce souvenir ne peut m'etre arrache!
Comme le matelot brise par la tempete,
               Je m'y tiens attache.

Je ne veux rien savoir, ni si les champs fleurissent,
Ni ce qu'il adviendra du simulacre humain,
Ni si ces vastes cieux eclaireront demain
               Ce qu'ils ensevelissent.

Je me dis seulement: "A cette heure, en ce lieu,
Un jour, je fus aime, j'aimais, elle etait belle.
J'enfouis ce tresor dans mon ame immortelle,
               Et je l'emporte a Dieu!"


SUR UNE MORTE

Elle etait belle si la Nuit
Qui dort dans la sombre chapelle
Ou Michel-Ange a fait son lit,
Immobile peut etre belle.

Elle etait bonne, s'il suffit
Qu'en passant la main s'ouvre et donne,
Sans que Dieu n'ait rien vu, rien dit:
Si l'or sans pitie fait l'aumone.

Elle pensait, si le vain bruit
D'une voix douce et cadencee,
Comme le ruisseau qui gemit,
Peut faire croire a la pensee.

Elle priait, si deux beaux yeux,
Tantot s'attachant a la terre,
Tantot se levant vers les cieux,
Peuvent s'appeler la priere.

Elle aurait souri, si la fleur
Qui ne s'est point epanouie,
Pouvait s'ouvrir a la fraicheur
Du vent qui passe et qui l'oublie.

Elle aurait pleure, si sa main,
Sur son coeur froidement posee,
Eut jamais dans l'argile humain
Senti la celeste rosee.

Elle aurait aime, si l'orgueil,
Pareil a la lampe inutile
Qu'on allume pres d'un cercueil,
N'eut veille sur son coeur sterile.

Elle est morte et n'a point vecu.
Elle faisait semblant de vivre.
De ses mains est tombe le livre
Dans lequel elle n'a rien lu.


A M. VICTOR HUGO

Il faut, dans ce bas monde, aimer beaucoup de choses,
Pour savoir, apres tout, ce qu'on aime le mieux:
Les bonbons, l'Ocean, le jeu, l'azur des cieux,
Les femmes, les chevaux, les lauriers et les roses.

Il faut fouler aux pieds des fleurs a peine ecloses;
Il faut beaucoup pleurer, dire beaucoup d'adieux.
Puis le coeur s'apercoit qu'il est devenu vieux,
Et l'effet qui s'en va nous decouvre les causes.

De ces biens passagers que l'on goute a demi,
Le meilleur qui nous reste est un ancien ami.
On se brouille, on se fuit.--Qu'un hasard nous rassemble,

On s'approche, on sourit, la main touche la main,
Et nous nous souvenons que nous marchions ensemble,
Que l'ame est immortelle, et qu'hier c'est demain.


ADIEU, SUZON

CHANSON.

Adieu, Suzon, ma rose blonde,
Qui m'as aime pendant huit jours:
Les plus courts plaisirs de ce monde
Souvent font les meilleurs amours.
Sais-je, au moment ou je te quitte,
Ou m'entraine mon astre errant?
Je m'en vais pourtant, ma petite,
      Bien loin, bien vite,
      Toujours courant.

Paf ! C'est mon cheval qu'on apprete.
Enfant, que ne puis-je en chemin
Emporter ta mauvaise tete,
Qui m'a tout embaume la main!
Tu souris, petite hypocrite,
Comme la nymphe, en t'en fuyant.
Je m'en vais pourtant, ma petite,
      Bien loin, bien vite,
      Tout en riant.

Que de tristesse et que de charmes,
Tendre enfant, dans tes doux adieux!
Tout m'enivre, jusqu'a tes larmes,
Lorsque ton coeur est dans tes yeux.
A vivre ton regard m'invite;
Il me consolerait mourant.
Je m'en vais pourtant, ma petite,
      Bien loin, bien vite,
      Tout en pleurant.

Que notre amour, si tu m'oublies,
Suzon, dure encore un moment;
Comme un bouquet de fleurs palies,
Cache-le dans ton sein charmant!
Adieu! le bonheur reste au gite;
Le souvenir part avec moi :
Je l'emporterai, ma petite,
      Bien loin, bien vite,
      Toujours a toi.

VOYAGE

Il me faut du nouveau n'en fut-il
plus au monde.
JEAN DE LA FONTAINE.

Jam mens praetrepidans avet vagari,
Jam laeti studio pedes vigescunt.
CATULLE.

Au travers de la vitre blanche
Le soleil rit, et sur les murs
Tracant de grands angles, epanche
Ses rayons splendides et purs:
Par un si beau temps, a la ville
Rester parmi la foule vile!
Je veux voir des sites nouveaux:
Postillons, sellez vos chevaux.

Au sein d'un nuage de poudre,
Par un galop precipite,
Aussi promptement que la foudre
Comme il est doux d'etre emporte!
Le sable bruit sous la roue,
Le vent autour de vous se joue;
Je veux voir des sites nouveaux:
Postillons, pressez vos chevaux.

Les arbres qui bordent la route
Paraissent fuir rapidement,
Leur forme obscure dont l'oeil doute
Ne se dessine qu'un moment;
Le ciel, tel qu'une banderole,
Par-dessus les bois roule et vole;
Je veux voir des sites nouveaux:
Postillons, pressez vos chevaux.

Chaumieres, fermes isolees,
Vieux chateaux que flanque une tour,
Monts arides, fraiches vallees,
Forets se suivent tour a tour;
Parfois au milieu d'une brume,
Un ruisseau dont la chute ecume;
Je veux voir des sites nouveaux:
Postillons, pressez vos chevaux.

Puis, une hirondelle qui passe,
Rasant la greve au sable d'or,
Puis, semes dans un large espace,
Les moutons d'un berger qui dort;
De grandes perspectives bleues,
Larges et longues de vingt lieues;
Je veux voir des sites nouveaux:
Postillons, pressez vos chevaux.

Une montagne: l'on enraye,
Au bord du rapide penchant
D'un mont dont la hauteur effraye:
Les chevaux glissent en marchant,
L'essieu grince, le pave fume,
Et la roue un instant s'allume;
Je veux voir des sites nouveaux:
Postillons, pressez vos chevaux.

La cote raide est descendue.
Recouverte de sable fin,
La route, a chaque instant perdue,
S'etend comme un ruban sans fin.
Que cette plaine est monotone!
On dirait un matin d'automne;
Je veux voir des sites nouveaux:
Postillons, pressez vos chevaux.

Une ville d'un aspect sombre,
Avec ses tours et ses clochers
Qui montent dans les airs, sans nombre,
Comme des mats ou des rochers,
Ou mille lumieres flamboient
Au sein des ombres qui la noient;
Je veux voir des sites nouveaux:
Postillons, pressez vos chevaux.

Mais ils sont las, et leurs narines,
Rouges de sang, soufflent du feu;
L'ecume inonde leurs poitrines,
Il faut nous arreter un peu.
Halte! demain, plus vite encore,
Aussitot que poindra l'aurore,
Postillons, pressez vos chevaux,
Je veux voir des sites nouveaux.


TOMBEE DU JOUR

Le jour tombait, une pale nuee
Du haut du ciel laissait nonchalamment,
Dans l'eau du fleuve a peine remuee,
Tremper les plis de son blanc vetement.

La nuit parut, la nuit morne et sereine,
Portant le deuil de son frere le jour,
Et chaque etoile a son trone de reine,
En habits d'or s'en vint faire sa cour.

On entendait pleurer les tourterelles,
Et les enfants rever dans leurs berceaux;
C'etait dans l'air comme un frolement d'ailes,
Comme le bruit d'invisibles oiseaux.

Le ciel parlait a voix basse a la terre;
Comme au vieux temps ils parlaient en hebreu,
Et repetaient un acte de mystere;
Je n'y compris qu'un seul mot: c'etait Dieu.


NOEL

Le ciel est noir, la terre est blanche;
--Cloches, carillonnez gaiment!--
Jesus est ne;--la Vierge penche
Sur lui son visage charmant.

Pas de courtines festonnees
Pour preserver l'enfant du froid;
Rien que les toiles d'araignees
Qui pendent des poutres du toit.

Il tremble sur la paille fraiche,
Ce cher petit enfant Jesus,
Et pour rechauffer dans sa creche
L'ane et le boeuf soufflent dessus.

La neige au chaume coud ses franges,
Mais sur le toit s'ouvre le ciel
Et, tout en blanc, le choeur des anges
Chante aux bergers: "_Noel! Noel!_"


FUMEE

La-bas, sous les arbres s'abrite
Une chaumiere au dos bossu;
Le toit penche, le mur s'effrite,
Le seuil de la porte est moussu.

La fenetre, un volet la bouche;
Mais du taudis, comme au temps froid
La tiede baleine d'une bouche,
La respiration se voit.

Un tire-bouchon de fumee,
Tournant son mince filet bleu,
De l'ame en ce bouge enfermee
Porte des nouvelles a Dieu.


CHOC DE CAVALIERS

Hier il m'a semble (sans doute j'etais ivre)
Voir sur l'arche d'un pont un choc de cavaliers
Tout cuirasses de fer, tout imbriques de cuivre,
Et caparaconnes de harnois singuliers.

Des dragons accroupis grommelaient sur leurs casques,
Des Meduses d'airain ouvraient leurs yeux hagards
Dans leurs grands boucliers aux ornements fantasques,
Et des noeuds de serpents ecaillaient leurs brassards.

Par moment, du rebord de l'arcade geante,
Un cavalier blesse perdant son point d'appui,
Un cheval effare tombait dans l'eau beante,
Gueule de crocodile entr'ouverte sous lui.

C'etait vous, mes desirs, c'etait vous, mes pensees,
Qui cherchiez a forcer le passage du pont,
Et vos corps tout meurtris sous leurs armes faussees,
Dorment ensevelis dans le gouffre profond.


LES COLOMBES

Sur le coteau, la-bas ou sont les tombes,
Un beau palmier, comme un panache vert,
Dresse sa tete, ou le soir les colombes
Viennent nicher et se mettre a couvert.

Mais le matin elles quittent les branches:
Comme un collier qui s'egrene, on les voit
S'eparpiller dans l'air bleu, toutes blanches,
Et se poser plus loin sur quelque toit.

Mon ame est l'arbre ou tous les soirs, comme elles,
De blancs essaims de folles visions
Tombent des cieux, en palpitant des ailes,
Pour s'envoler des les premiers rayons.


LAMENTO

    Ma belle amie est morte,
    Je pleurerai toujours;
    Sous la tombe elle emporte
    Mon ame et mes amours.
    Dans le ciel, sans m'attendre,
    Elle s'en retourna;
    L'ange qui l'emmena
    Ne voulut pas me prendre.
    Que mon sort est amer!
Ah! sans amour, s'en aller sur la mer!

    La blanche creature
    Est couchee au cercueil.
    Comme dans la nature
    Tout me parait en deuil!
    La colombe oubliee
    Pleure et songe a l'absent;
    Mon ame pleure et sent
    Qu'elle est depareillee.
    Que mon sort est amer!
Ah! sans amour, s'en aller sur la mer!

    Sur moi la nuit immense
    S'etend comme un linceul;
    Je chante ma romance
    Que le ciel entend seul.
    Ah! comme elle etait belle
    Et comme je l'aimais!
    Je n'aimerai jamais
    Une femme autant qu'elle;
    Que mon sort est amer!
Ah! sans amour, s'en aller sur la mer!


TRISTESSE

       Avril est de retour.
       La premiere des roses,
       De ses levres mi-closes,
       Rit au premier beau jour;
       La terre bienheureuse
       S'ouvre et s'epanouit;
       Tout aime, tout jouit.
Helas! j'ai dans le coeur une tristesse affreuse.

       Les buveurs en gaite,
       Dans leurs chansons vermeilles,
       Celebrent sous les treilles
       Le vin et la beaute;
       La musique joyeuse,
       Avec leur rire clair,
       S'eparpille dans l'air.
Helas! j'ai dans le coeur une tristesse affreuse.

       En deshabilles blancs,
       Les jeunes demoiselles
       S'en vont sous les tonnelles
       Au bras de leurs galants;
       La lune langoureuse
       Argente leurs baisers
       Longuement appuyes.
Helas! j'ai dans le coeur une tristesse affreuse.

       Moi, je n'aime plus rien,
       Ni l'homme ni la femme,
       Ni mon corps, ni mon ame,
       Pas meme mon vieux chien.
       Allez dire qu'on creuse,
       Sous le pale gazon,
       Une fosse sans nom.
Helas! j'ai dans le coeur une tristesse affreuse.


LA CARAVANE

La caravane humaine au Sahara du monde,
Par ce chemin des ans qui n'a pas de retour,
S'en va trainant le pied, brulee aux feux du jour,
Et buvant sur ses bras la sueur qui l'inonde.

  Le grand lion rugit et la tempete gronde;
A l'horizon fuyard, ni minaret, ni tour;
La seule ombre qu'on ait, c'est l'ombre du vautour,
Qui traverse le ciel cherchant sa proie immonde.

  L'on avance toujours, et voici que l'on voit
Quelque chose de vert que l'on se montre au doigt:
C'est un bois de cypres, seme de blanches pierres.

  Dieu, pour vous reposer, dans le desert du temps,
Comme des oasis, a mis les cimetieres:
Couchez-vous et dormez, voyageurs haletants.


PLAINTIVE TOURTERELLE

Plaintive tourterelle,
Qui roucoules toujours,
Veux-tu preter ton aile
Pour servir mes amours?

Comme toi, pauvre amante,
Bien loin de mon ramier,
Je pleure et me lamente
Sans pouvoir l'oublier.

Vole et que ton pied rose
Sur l'arbre ou sur la tour
Jamais ne se repose,
Car je languis d'amour.

Evite, o ma colombe,
La halte des palmiers
Et tous les toits ou tombe
La neige des ramiers.

Va droit sur sa fenetre,
Pres du palais du roi,
Donne-lui cette lettre
Et deux baisers pour moi.

Puis sur mon sein en flamme,
Qui ne peut s'apaiser,
Reviens, avec son ame,
Reviens te reposer,


PREMIER SOURIRE DU PRINTEMPS

Tandis qu'a leurs oeuvres perverses
Les hommes courent haletants,
Mars qui rit, malgre les averses,
Prepare en secret le printemps.

Pour les petites paquerettes,
Sournoisement lorsque tout dort,
Il repasse des collerettes
Et cisele des boutons d'or.

Dans le verger et dans la vigne,
Il s'en va, furtif perruquier,
Avec une houppe de cygne,
Poudrer a frimas l'amandier.

La nature au lit se repose;
Lui, descend au jardin desert
Et lace les boutons de rose
Dans leur corset de velours vert.

Tout en composant des solfeges,
Qu'aux merles il siffle a mi-voix,
Il seme aux pres les perce-neiges
Et les violettes aux bois.

Sur le cresson de la fontaine
Ou le cerf boit, l'oreille au guet,
De sa main cachee il egrene
Les grelots d'argent du muguet.

Sous l'herbe, pour que tu la cueilles,
Il met la fraise au teint vermeil,
Et te tresse un chapeau de feuilles
Pour te garantir du soleil.

Puis, lorsque sa besogne est faite,
Et que son regne va finir,
Au seuil d'avril tournant la tete,
Il dit: "Printemps, tu peux venir!"



L'AVEUGLE

Un aveugle au coin d'une borne,
Hagard comme au jour un hibou,
Sur son flageolet, d'un air morne,
Tatonne en se trompant de trou,

Et joue un ancien vaudeville
Qu'il fausse imperturbablement;
Son chien le conduit par la ville,
Spectre diurne a l'oeil dormant.

Les jours sur lui passent sans luire;
Sombre, il entend le monde obscur
Et la vie invisible bruire
Comme un torrent derriere un mur!

Dieu sait quelles chimeres noires
Hantent cet opaque cerveau!
Et quels illisibles grimoires
L'idee ecrit en ce caveau!

Ainsi dans les puits de Venise,
Un prisonnier a demi fou,
Pendant sa nuit qui s'eternise,
Grave des mots avec un clou.

Mais peut-etre aux heures funebres,
Quand la mort souffle le flambeau,
L'ame habituee aux tenebres
Y verra clair dans le tombeau!


LA SOURCE

Tout pres du lac filtre une source,
Entre deux pierres, dans un coin;
Allegrement l'eau prend sa course
Comme pour s'en aller bien loin.

Elle murmure: Oh! quelle joie!
Sous la terre il faisait si noir!
Maintenant ma rive verdoie,
Le ciel se mire a mon miroir.

Les myosotis aux fleurs bleues
Me disent : Ne m'oubliez pas!
Les libellules de leurs queues
M'egratignent dans leurs ebats:

A ma coupe l'oiseau s'abreuve;
Qui sait?--Apres quelques detours
Peut-etre deviendrai-je un fleuve
Baignant vallons, rochers et tours.

Je broderai de mon ecume
Ponts de pierre, quais de granit,
Emportant le steamer qui fume
A l'Ocean ou tout finit.

Ainsi la jeune source jase,
Formant cent projets d'avenir;
Comme l'eau qui bout dans un vase,
Son flot ne peut se contenir;

Mais le berceau touche a la tombe;
Le geant futur meurt petit;
Nee a peine, la source tombe
Dans le grand lac qui l'engloutit


LE MERLE

Un oiseau siffle dans les branches
Et sautille gai, plein d'espoir,
Sur les herbes, de givre blanches,
En bottes jaunes, en frac noir.

C'est un merle, chanteur credule,
Ignorant du calendrier,
Qui reve soleil, et module
L'hymne d'avril en fevrier.

Pourtant il vente, il pleut a verse;
L'Arve jaunit le Rhone bleu,
Et le salon, tendu de perse,
Tient tous ses hotes pres du feu.

Les monts sur l'epaule ont l'hermine,
Comme des magistrats siegeant;
Leur blanc tribunal examine
Un cas d'hiver se prolongeant.

Lustrant son aile qu'il essuie,
L'oiseau persiste en sa chanson,
Malgre neige, brouillard et pluie,
Il croit a la jeune saison.

Il gronde l'aube paresseuse
De rester au lit si longtemps
Et, gourmandant la fleur frileuse,
Met en demeure le printemps.

Il voit le jour derriere l'ombre;
Tel un croyant, dans le saint lieu,
L'autel desert, sous la nef sombre,
Avec sa foi voit toujours Dieu.

A la nature il se confie,
Car son instinct pressent la loi.
Qui rit de ta philosophie,
Beau merle, est moins sage que toi!


L'ART

Oui, l'oeuvre sort plus belle
D'une forme au travail
      Rebelle,
Vers, marbre, onyx, email.

Point de contraintes fausses!
Mais que, pour marcher droit,
      Tu chausses,
Muse, un cothurne etroit.

Fi du rhythme commode,
Comme un soulier trop grand,
      Du mode
Que tout pied quitte et prend!

Statuaire, repousse
L'argile que petrit
      Le pouce
Quand flotte ailleurs l'esprit.

Lutte avec le carrare,
Avec le paros dur
      Et rare,
Gardiens du contour pur;

Emprunte a Syracuse
Son bronze ou fermement
      S'accuse
Le trait fier et charmant;

D'une main delicate
Poursuis dans un filon
      D'agate
Le profil d'Apollon.

Peintre, fuis l'aquarelle,
Et fixe la couleur
      Trop frele
Au four de l'emailleur.

Fais les sirenes bleues,
Tordant de cent facons
      Leurs queues,
Les monstres des blasons;

Dans son nimbe trilobe
La Vierge et son Jesus,
      Le globe
Avec la croix dessus.

Tout passe.--L'art robuste
Seul a l'eternite.
      Le buste
Survit a la cite.

Et la medaille austere
Que trouve un laboureur
      Sous terre
Revele un empereur.

Les dieux eux-memes meurent.
Mais les vers souverains
      Demeurent
Plus forts que les airains.

Sculpte, lime, cisele;
Que ton reve flottant
      Se scelle
Dans le bloc resistant!



VICTOR DE LAPRADE


A UN GRAND ARBRE

L'esprit calme des dieux habite dans les plantes.
Heureux est le grand arbre aux feuillages epais;
Dans son corps large et sain la seve coule en paix,
Mais le sang se consume en nos veines brulantes.

A la croupe du mont tu sieges comme un roi;
Sur ce trone abrite, je t'aime et je t'envie;
Je voudrais echanger ton etre avec ma vie,
Et me dresser tranquille et sage comme toi.

Le vent n'effleure pas le sol ou tu m'accueilles;
L'orage y descendrait sans pouvoir t'ebranler;
Sur tes plus hauts rameaux, que seuls on voit trembler,
Comme une eau lente, a peine il fait gemir tes feuilles.

L'aube, un instant, les touche avec son doigt vermeil;
Sur tes obscurs reseaux semant sa lueur blanche,
La lune aux pieds d'argent descend de branche en branche,
Et midi baigne en plein ton front dans le soleil.

L'eternelle Cybele embrasse tes pieds fermes;
Les secrets de son sein, tu les sens, tu les vois;
Au commun reservoir en silence tu bois,
Enlace dans ces flancs ou dorment tous les germes.

Salut, toi qu'en naissant l'homme aurait adore!
Notre age, qui se rue aux luttes convulsives,
Te voyant immobile, a doute que tu vives,
Et ne reconnait plus en toi d'hote sacre,

Ah! moi je sens qu'une ame est la sous ton ecorce:
Tu n'as pas nos transports et nos desirs de feu,
Mais tu reves, profond et serein comme un dieu;
Ton immobilite repose sur ta force.

Salut! Un charme agit et s'echange entre nous.
Arbre, je suis peu fier de l'humaine nature;
Un esprit revetu d'ecorce et de verdure
Me semble aussi puissant que le notre, et plus doux.

Verse a flots sur mon front ton ombre qui m'apaise;
Puisse mon sang dormir et mon corps s'affaisser;
Que j'existe un moment sans vouloir ni penser:
La volonte me trouble, et la raison me pese.

Je souffre du desir, orage interieur;
Mais tu ne connais, toi, ni l'espoir, ni le doute,
Et tu n'as su jamais ce que le plaisir coute;
Tu ne l'achetes pas au prix de la douleur.

Quand un beau jour commence et quand le mal fait treve,
Les promesses du ciel ne valent pas l'oubli;
Dieu meme ne peut rien sur le temps accompli;
Nul songe n'est si doux qu'un long sommeil sans reve.

Le chene a le repos, l'homme a la liberte....
Que ne puis-je en ce lieu prendre avec toi racines!
Obeir, sans penser, a des forces divines,
C'est etre dieu soi-meme, et c'est ta volupte.

Verse, ah! verse dans moi tes fraicheurs printanieres,
Les bruits melodieux des essaims et des nids,
Et le frissonnement des songes infinis;
Pour ta serenite je t'aime entre nos freres.

Si j'avais, comme toi, tout un mont pour soutien,
Si mes deux pieds trempaient dans la source des choses,
Si l'Aurore humectait mes cheveux de ses roses,
Si mon coeur recelait toute la paix du tien;

Si j'etais un grand chene avec ta seve pure,
Pour tous, ainsi que toi, bon, riche, hospitalier,
J'abriterais l'abeille et l'oiseau familier
Qui sur ton front touffu repandent le murmure;

Mes feuilles verseraient l'oubli sacre du mal,
Le sommeil, a mes pieds, monterait de la mousse
Et la viendraient tous ceux que la cite repousse
Ecouter ce silence ou parle l'ideal.

Nourri par la nature, au destin resignee,
Des esprits qu'elle aspire et qui la font rever,
Sans trembler devant lui, comme sans le braver,
Du bucheron divin j'attendrais la cognee.


BEATRIX

Gloire au coeur temeraire epris de l'impossible,
Qui marche, dans l'amour, au sentier des douleurs,
Et fuit tout vain plaisir au vulgaire accessible.

Heureux qui sur sa route, invite par les fleurs,
Passe et n'ecarte point leur feuillage ou leurs voiles,
Et, vers l'azur lointain tournant ses yeux en pleurs,

Tend ses bras insenses pour cueillir les etoiles.
Une beaute, cachee aux desirs trop humains,
Sourit a ses regards, sur d'invisibles toiles;

Vers ses ambitions lui frayant des chemins,
Un ange le soutient sur des brises propices;
Les astres bien aimes s'approchent de ses mains;

Les lis du paradis lui pretent leurs calices.
Beatrix ouvre un monde a qui la prend pour soeur,
A qui lutte et se dompte et souffre avec delices,

Et goute a s'immoler sa plus chere douceur;
Et, joyeux, s'elancant au dela du visible,
De la porte du ciel s'approche en ravisseur.
Gloire au coeur temeraire epris de l'impossible!


LE DROIT D'AINESSE

Te voila fort et grand garcon,
Tu vas entrer dans la jeunesse;
Recois ma derniere lecon:
Apprends quel est ton droit d'ainesse.

Pour le connaitre en sa rigueur
Tu n'as pas besoin d'un gros livre;
Ce droit est ecrit dans ton coeur....
Ton coeur! c'est la loi qu'il faut suivre,

Afin de le comprendre mieux,
Tu vas y lire avec ton pere,
Devant ces portraits des aieux
Qui nous aideront, je l'espere.

Ainsi que mon pere l'a fait,
Un brave aine de notre race
Se montre fier et satisfait
En prenant la plus dure place.

A lui le travail, le danger,
La lutte avec le sort contraire;
A lui l'orgueil de proteger
La grande soeur, le petit frere.

Son epargne est le fonds commun
Ou puiseront tous ceux qu'il aime;
Il accroit la part de chacun
De tout ce qu'il s'ote a lui-meme.

Il voit, au prix de ses efforts,
Suivant les traces paternelles,
Tous les freres savants et forts,
Toutes les soeurs sages et belles.

C'est lui qui, dans chaque saison,
Pourvoyeur de toutes les fetes,
Fait abonder dans la maison
Les fleurs, les livres des poetes.

Il travaille, enfin, nuit et jour:
Qu'importe! les autres jouissent.
N'est-il pas le pere a son tour?
S'il vieillit, les enfants grandissent!

Du poste ou le bon Dieu l'a mis
Il ne s'ecarte pas une heure;
Il y fait tete aux ennemis,
Il y mourra, s'il faut qu'il meure!

Quand le berger manque au troupeau,
Absent, helas! ou mort peut-etre,
Tel, pour la brebis et l'agneau,
Le bon chien meurt apres son maitre.

Ainsi, quand Dieu me reprendra,
Tu sais, dans notre humble heritage,
Tu sais le lot qui t'echerra
Et qui te revient sans partage.

Nos chers petits seront heureux,
Mais il faut qu'en toi je renaisse.
Veiller, lutter, souffrir pour eux....
Voila, mon fils, ton droit d'ainesse!




MME. L. ACKERMANN


L'HOMME

Jete par le hasard sur un vieux globe infime,
  A l'abandon, perdu comme en un ocean,
Je surnage un moment et flotte a fleur d'abime,
          Epave du neant.

Et pourtant, c'est a moi, quand sur des mers sans rives
  Un naufrage eternel semblait me menacer,
Qu'une voix a crie du fond de l'Etre: "Arrive!
          Je t'attends pour penser."

L'Inconscience encor sur la nature entiere
  Etendait tristement son voile epais et lourd.
J'apparus; aussitot a travers la matiere
          L'Esprit se faisait jour.

Secouant ma torpeur et tout etonne d'etre,
  J'ai surmonte mon trouble et mon premier emoi,
Plonge dans le grand Tout, j'ai su m'y reconnaitre;
          Je m'affirme et dis: "Moi!"

Bien que la chair impure encor m'assujettisse,
  Des aveugles instincts j'ai rompu le reseau;
J'ai cree la Pudeur, j'ai concu la Justice;
          Mon coeur fut leur berceau.

Seul je m'enquiers des fins et je remonte aux causes.
  A mes yeux l'univers n'est qu'un spectacle vain.
Dusse-je m'abuser, au mirage des choses
          Je prete un sens divin.

Je defie a mon gre la mort et la souffrance.
  Nature impitoyable, en vain tu me demens,
Je n'en crois que mes voeux, et fais de l'esperance
          Meme avec mes tourments.

Pour combler le neant, ce gouffre vide et morne,
  S'il suffit d'aspirer un instant, me voila!
Fi de cet ici-bas! Tout m'y cerne et m'y borne;
          Il me faut l'au-dela!

Je veux de l'eternel, moi qui suis l'ephemere.
  Quand le reel me presse, imperieux, brutal,
Pour refuge au besoin n'ai-je pas la chimere
          Qui s'appelle Ideal?

Je puis avec orgueil, au sein des nuits profondes,
  De l'ether etoile contempler la splendeur.
Gardez votre infini, cieux lointains, vastes mondes,
          J'ai le mien dans mon coeur!




LECONTE DE LISLE


LES MONTREURS

Tel qu'un morne animal, meurtri, plein de poussiere,
La chaine au cou, hurlant au chaud soleil d'ete,
Promene qui voudra son coeur ensanglante
Sur ton pave cynique, o plebe carnassiere!

Pour mettre un feu sterile en ton oeil hebete,
Pour mendier ton rire ou ta pitie grossiere,
Dechire qui voudra la robe de lumiere
De la pudeur divine et de la volupte.

Dans mon orgueil muet, dans ma tombe sans gloire,
Dusse-je m'engloutir pour l'eternite noire,
Je ne te vendrai pas mon ivresse ou mon mal,

Je ne livrerai pas ma vie a tes huees,
Je ne danserai pas sur ton treteau banal
Avec tes histrions et tes prostituees.


MIDI

Midi, roi des etes, epandu sur la plaine,
Tombe en nappes d'argent des hauteurs du ciel bleu.
Tout se tait. L'air flamboie et brule sans haleine;
La terre est assoupie en sa robe de feu.

L'etendue est immense, et les champs n'ont pas d'ombre
Et la source est tarie ou buvaient les troupeaux;
La lointaine foret, dont la lisiere est sombre,
Dort la-bas, immobile, en un pesant repos.

Seuls, les grands bles muris, tels qu'une mer doree
Se deroulent au loin, dedaigneux du sommeil;
Pacifiques enfants de la terre sacree,
Ils epuisent sans peur la coupe du soleil.

Parfois, comme un soupir de leur ame brulante,
Du sein des epis lourds qui murmurent entre eux,
Une ondulation majestueuse et lente
S'eveille, et va mourir a l'horizon poudreux.

Non loin, quelques boeufs blancs, couches parmi les herbes.
Bavent avec lenteur sur leurs fanons epais,
Et suivent de leurs yeux languissants et superbes
Le songe interieur qu'ils n'achevent jamais.

Homme, si, le coeur plein de joie ou d'amertume,
Tu passais vers midi dans les champs radieux,
Fuis! la nature est vide et le soleil consume:
Rien n'est vivant ici, rien n'est triste ou joyeux.

Mais si, desabuse des larmes et du rire,
Altere de l'oubli de ce monde agite,
Tu veux, ne sachant plus pardonner ou maudire,
Gouter une supreme et morne volupte,

Viens! Le soleil te parle en paroles sublimes;
Dans sa flamme implacable absorbe-toi sans fin;
Et retourne a pas lents vers les cites infimes,
Le coeur trempe sept fois dans le neant divin.


NOX

Sur la pente des monts les brises apaisees
Inclinent au sommeil les arbres onduleux;
L'oiseau silencieux s'endort dans les rosees,
Et l'etoile a dore l'ecume des flots bleus.

Au contour des ravins, sur les hauteurs sauvages,
Une molle vapeur efface les chemins;
La lune tristement baigne les noirs feuillages;
L'oreille n'entend plus les murmures humains.

Mais sur le sable au loin chante la mer divine,
Et des hautes forets gemit la grande voix,
Et l'air sonore, aux cieux que la nuit illumine,
Porte le chant des mers et le soupir des bois.

Montez, saintes rumeurs, paroles surhumaines,
Entretien lent et doux de la terre et du ciel!
Montez, et demandez aux etoiles sereines
S'il est pour les atteindre un chemin eternel.

O mers, o bois songeurs, voix pieuses du monde,
Vous m'avez repondu durant mes jours mauvais,
Vous avez apaise ma tristesse infeconde,
Et dans mon coeur aussi vous chantez a jamais!


L'ECCLESIASTE

L'ecclesiaste a dit: Un chien vivant vaut mieux
Qu'un lion mort. Hormi, certes, manger et boire,
Tout n'est qu'ombre et fumee. Et le monde est tres vieux,
Et le neant de vivre emplit la tombe noire.

Par les antiques nuits, a la face des cieux,
Du sommet de sa tour comme d'un promontoire,
Dans le silence, au loin laissant planer ses yeux,
Sombre, tel il songeait sur son siege d'ivoire.

Vieil amant du soleil, qui gemissais ainsi,
L'irrevocable mort est un mensonge aussi.
Heureux qui d'un seul bond s'engloutirait en elle.

Moi, toujours, a jamais, j'ecoute, epouvante,
Dans l'ivresse et l'horreur de l'immortalite,
Le long rugissement de la Vie eternelle.


LA VERANDAH

Au tintement de l'eau dans les porphyres roux
Les rosiers de l'Iran melent leurs frais murmures,
Et les ramiers reveurs leurs roucoulements doux.
Tandis que l'oiseau grele et le frelon jaloux,
Sifflant et bourdonnant, mordent les figues mures,
Les rosiers de l'Iran melent leurs frais murmures
Au tintement de l'eau dans les porphyres roux.

Sous les treillis d'argent de la verandah close,
Dans l'air tiede embaume de l'odeur des jasmins,
Ou la splendeur du jour darde une fleche rose,
La Persane royale, immobile, repose,
Derriere son col brun croisant ses belles mains,
Dans l'air tiede, embaume de l'odeur des jasmins,
Sous les treillis d'argent de la verandah close.

Jusqu'aux levres que l'ambre arrondi baise encor,
Du cristal d'ou s'echappe une vapeur subtile
Qui monte en tourbillons legers et prend l'essor,
Sur les coussins de soie ecarlate, aux fleurs d'or,
La branche du huka rode comme un reptile
Du cristal d'ou s'echappe une vapeur subtile
Jusqu'aux levres que l'ambre arrondi baise encor.

Deux rayons noirs, charges d'une muette ivresse,
Sortent de ses longs yeux entr'ouverts a demi;
Un songe l'enveloppe, un souffle la caresse;
Et parce que l'effluve invincible l'oppresse,
Parce que son beau sein qui se gonfle a fremi,
Sortent de ses longs yeux entr'ouverts a demi
Deux rayons noirs, charges d'une muette ivresse.

Et l'eau vive s'endort dans les porphyres roux,
Les rosiers de l'Iran ont cesse leurs murmures,
Et les ramiers reveurs leurs roucoulements doux.
Tout se tait. L'oiseau grele et le frelon jaloux
Ne se querellent plus autour des figues mures.
Les rosiers de l'Iran ont cesse leurs murmures,
Et l'eau vive s'endort dans les porphyres roux.


LES ELFES

Couronnes de thym et de marjolaine,
Les Elfes joyeux dansent sur la plaine.

Du sentier des bois aux daims familier,
Sur un noir cheval, sort un chevalier.
Son eperon d'or brille en la nuit brune;
Et, quand il traverse un rayon de lune,
On voit resplendir, d'un reflet changeant,
Sur sa chevelure un casque d'argent.

Couronnes de thym et de marjolaine,
Les Elfes joyeux dansent sur la plaine.

Ils l'entourent tous d'un essaim leger
Qui dans l'air muet semble voltiger.
--Hardi chevalier, par la nuit sereine,
Ou vas-tu si tard? dit la jeune Reine.
De mauvais esprits hantent les forets;
Viens danser plutot sur les gazons frais.

Couronnes de thym et de marjolaine,
Les Elfes joyeux dansent sur la plaine.

--Non! ma fiancee aux yeux clairs et doux
M'attend, et demain nous serons epoux.
Laissez-moi passer, Elfes des prairies,
Qui foulez en rond les mousses fleuries;
Ne m'attardez pas loin de mon amour,
Car voici deja les lueurs du jour.--

Couronnes de thym et de marjolaine,
Les Elfes joyeux dansent sur la plaine.

--Reste, chevalier. Je te donnerai
L'opale magique et l'anneau dore,
Et, ce qui vaut mieux que gloire et fortune,
Ma robe filee au clair de la lune.
--Non! dit-il.--Va donc!--Et de son doigt blanc
Elle touche au coeur le guerrier tremblant.

Couronnes de thym et de marjolaine,
Les Elfes joyeux dansent sur la plaine.

Et sous l'eperon le noir cheval part.
Il court, il bondit et va sans retard;
Mais le chevalier frissonne et se penche;
Il voit sur la route une forme blanche
Qui marche sans bruit et lui tend les bras:
--Elfe, esprit, demon, ne m'arrete pas!--

Couronnes de thym et de marjolaine,
Les Elfes joyeux dansent sur la plaine.

--Ne m'arrete pas, fantome odieux!
Je vais epouser ma belle aux doux yeux.
--O mon cher epoux, la tombe eternelle
Sera notre lit de noce, dit-elle.
Je suis morte!--Et lui, la voyant ainsi,
D'angoisse et d'amour tombe mort aussi.

Couronnes de thym et de marjolaine,
Les Elfes joyeux dansent sur la plaine.


LES ELEPHANTS

Le sable rouge est comme une mer sans limite,
Et qui flambe, muette, affaissee en son lit.
Une ondulation immobile remplit
L'horizon aux vapeurs de cuivre ou l'homme habite.

Nulle vie et nul bruit. Tous les lions repus
Dorment au fond de l'antre eloigne de cent lieues,
Et la girafe boit dans les fontaines bleues,
La-bas, sous les dattiers des pantheres connus.

Pas un oiseau ne passe en fouettant de son aile
L'air epais, ou circule un immense soleil.
Parfois quelque boa, chauffe dans son sommeil,
Fait onduler son dos dont l'ecaille etincelle.

Tel l'espace enflamme brule sous les cieux clairs.
Mais, tandis que tout dort aux mornes solitudes,
Les elephants rugueux, voyageurs lents et rudes,
Vont au pays natal a travers les deserts.

D'un point de l'horizon, comme des masses brunes,
Ils viennent, soulevant la poussiere, et l'on voit,
Pour ne pas devier du chemin le plus droit,
Sous leur pied large et sur crouler au loin les dunes.

Celui qui; tient la tete est un vieux chef. Son corps
Est gerce comme un tronc que le temps ronge et mine;
Sa tete est comme un roc, et l'arc de son echine
Se voute puissamment a ses moindres efforts.

Sans ralentir jamais et sans hater sa marche,
Il guide au but certain ses compagnons poudreux;
Et, creusant par derriere un sillon sablonneux,
Les pelerins massifs suivent leur patriarche.

L'oreille en eventail, la trompe entre les dents,
Ils cheminent, l'oeil clos. Leur ventre bat et fume,
Et leur sueur dans l'air embrase monte en brume;
Et bourdonnent autour mille insectes ardents.

Mais qu'importent la soif et la mouche vorace,
Et le soleil cuisant leur dos noir et plisse?
Ils revent en marchant du pays delaisse,
Des forets de figuiers ou s'abrita leur race.

Ils reverront le fleuve echappe des grands monts,
Ou nage en mugissant l'hippopotame enorme,
Ou, blanchis par la lune et projetant leur forme,
Ils descendaient pour boire en ecrasant les joncs.

Aussi, pleins de courage et de lenteur, ils passent
Comme une ligne noire, au sable illimite;
Et le desert reprend son immobilite
Quand les lourds voyageurs a l'horizon s'effacent.


LA CHUTE DES ETOILES

Tombez, o perles denouees,
Pales etoiles, dans la mer.
Un brouillard de roses nuees
Emerge de l'horizon clair;
A l'Orient plein d'etincelles
Le vent joyeux bat de ses ailes
L'onde qui brode un vif eclair.
Tombez, o perles immortelles,
Pales etoiles, dans la mer.

Plongez sous les ecumes fraiches
De l'Ocean mysterieux.
La lumiere crible de fleches
Le faite des monts radieux;
Mille et mille cris, par fusees,
Sortent des bois lourds de rosees;
Une musique vole aux cieux.
Plongez, de larmes arrosees,
Dans l'Ocean mysterieux.

Fuyez, astres melancoliques,
O Paradis lointains encor!
L'aurore aux levres metalliques
Rit dans le ciel et prend l'essor;
Elle se vet de molles flammes,
Et sur l'emeraude des lames
Fait petiller des gouttes d'or.
Fuyez, mondes ou vont les ames,
O Paradis lointains encor!

Allez, etoiles, aux nuits douces,
Aux cieux muets de l'Occident.
Sur les feuillages et les mousses
Le soleil darde un oeil ardent;
Les cerfs, par bonds, dans les vallees,
Se baignent aux sources troublees;
Le bruit des hommes va grondant.
Allez, o blanches exilees,
Aux cieux muets de l'Occident.
Heureux qui vous suit, clartes mornes,
O lampes qui versez l'oubli!
Comme vous, dans l'ombre sans bornes,
Heureux qui roule enseveli!
Celui-la vers la paix s'elance:
Haine, amour, larmes, violence,
Ce qui fut l'homme est aboli.
Donnez-nous l'eternel silence,
O lampes qui versez l'oubli!


MILLE ANS APRES

L'apre rugissement de la mer pleine d'ombres,
Cette nuit-la, grondait au fond des gorges noires,
Et tout echeveles, comme des spectres sombres,
De grands brouillards couraient le long des promontoires,

Le vent hurleur rompait en convulsives masses
Et sur les pics aigus eventrait les tenebres,
Ivre, emportant par bonds dans les lames voraces
Les bandes de taureaux aux beuglements funebres.

Semblable a quelque monstre enorme, epileptique,
Dont le poil se herisse et dont la bave fume,
La montagne, debout dans le ciel frenetique,
Geignait affreusement, le ventre blanc d'ecume.

Et j'ecoutais, ravi, ces voix desesperees.
Vos divines chansons vibraient dans l'air sonore,
O jeunesse, o desirs, o visions sacrees,
Comme un choeur de clairons eclatant a l'aurore!

Hors du gouffre infernal, sans y rien laisser d'elle,
Parmi ces cris et ces angoisses et ces fievres,
Mon ame en palpitant s'envolait d'un coup d'aile
Vers ton sourire, o gloire! et votre arome, o levres!

La nuit terrible, avec sa formidable bouche,
Disait:--La vie est douce; ouvre ses portes closes!
Et le vent me disait de son rale farouche:
--Adore! Absorbe-toi dans la beaute des choses!--

Voici qu'apres mille ans, seul, a travers les ages,
Je retourne, o terreur! a ces heures joyeuses,
Et je n'entends plus rien que les sanglots sauvages
Et l'ecroulement sourd des ombres furieuses.


LE SOIR D'UNE BATAILLE

Tels que la haute mer contre les durs rivages,
A la grande tuerie ils se sont tous rues,
Ivres et haletants, par les boulets troues,
En d'epais tourbillons pleins de clameurs sauvages.

Sous un large soleil d'ete, de l'aube au soir,
Sans relache, fauchant les bles, brisant les vignes
Longs  murs d'hommes, ils ont pousse leurs sombres lignes,
Et la, par blocs entiers, ils se sont laisses choir

Puis, ils se sont lies en etreintes feroces,
Le souffle au souffle uni, l'?il de haine charge.
Le fer d'un sang fievreux a l'aise s'est gorge;
La cervelle a jailli sous la lourdeur des crosses.

Victorieux, vaincus, fantassins, cavaliers,
Les voici maintenant, blemes, muets, farouches,
Les poings fermes, serrant les dents, et les yeux louches.
Dans la mort furieuse etendus par milliers.

La pluie, avec lenteur lavant leurs pales faces,
Aux pentes du terrain fait murmurer ses eaux;
Et par la morne plaine ou tourne un vol d'oiseaux
Le ciel d'un soir sinistre estompe au loin leurs masses.

Tous les cris se sont tus, les rales sont pousses.
Sur le sol bossue de tant de chair humaine,
Aux dernieres lueurs du jour on voit a peine
Se tordre vaguement des corps entrelaces;

Et la-bas, du milieu de ce massacre immense,
Dressant son cou roidi perce de coups de feu,
Un cheval jette au vent un rauque et triste adieu
Que la nuit fait courir a travers le silence.

O boucherie! o soif du meurtre! acharnement
Horrible! odeur des morts qui suffoques et navres!
Soyez maudits devant ces cent mille cadavres
Et la stupide horreur de cet egorgement.

Mais, sous l'ardent soleil ou sur la plaine noire,
Si, heurtant de leur coeur la gueule du canon,
Ils sont morts, Liberte, ces braves, en ton nom,
Beni soit le sang pur qui fume vers ta gloire!


IN EXCELSIS

Mieux que l'aigle chasseur, familier de la nue,
Homme! monte par bonds dans l'air resplendissant
La vieille terre, en bas, se tait et diminue.

Monte. Le clair abime ouvre a ton vol puissant
Les houles de l'azur que le soleil flagelle.
Dans la brume, le globe, en bas, va s'enfoncant.

Monte. La flamme tremble et palit, le ciel gele,
Un crepuscule morne etreint l'immensite.
Monte, monte et perds-toi dans la nuit eternelle:

Un gouffre calme, noir, informe, illimite,
L'evanouissement total de la matiere
Avec l'inenarrable et pleine cecite.

Esprit! monte a ton tour vers l'unique lumiere,
Laisse mourir en bas tous l^s anciens flambeaux,
Monte ou la Source en feu brule et jaillit entiere.

De reve en reve, va! des meilleurs aux plus beaux.
Pour gravir les degres de l'Echelle infinie,
Foule les dieux couches dans leurs sacres tombeaux.

L'intelligible cesse, et voici l'agonie,
Le mepris de soi-meme, et l'ombre, et le remord,
Et le renoncement furieux du genie.
Lumiere, ou donc es-tu? Peut-etre dans la mort.


REQUIES

Comme un morne exile, loin de ceux que j'aimais,
Je m'eloigne a pas lents des beaux jours de ma vie,
Du pays enchante qu'on ne revoit jamais.
Sur la haute colline ou la route devie
Je m'arrete, et vois fuir a l'horizon dormant
Ma derniere esperance, et pleure amerement.

O malheureux! crois-en ta muette detresse:
Rien ne refleurira, ton coeur ni ta jeunesse,
Au souvenir cruel de tes felicites.
Tourne plutot les yeux vers l'angoisse nouvelle,
Et laisse retomber dans leur nuit eternelle
L'amour et le bonheur que tu n'as point goutes.

Le temps n'a pas tenu ses promesses divines.
Tes yeux ne verront point reverdir tes ruines;
Livre leur cendre morte au souffle de l'oubli.
Endors-toi sans tarder en ton repos supreme,
Et souviens-toi, vivant dans l'ombre enseveli,
Qu'il n'est plus dans ce inonde un seul etre qui t'aime.

La vie est ainsi faite, il nous la faut subir.
Le faible souffre et pleure, et l'insense s'irrite;
Mais le plus sage en rit, sachant qu'il doit mourir.
Rentre au tombeau muet ou l'homme enfin s'abrite,
Et la, sans nul souci de la terre et du ciel,
Repose, o malheureux, pour le temps eterne!


DANS LE CIEL CLAIR

Dans le ciel clair raye par l'hirondelle alerte,
Le matin qui fleurit comme un divin rosier
Parfume la feuillee etincelante et verte
Ou les nids amoureux, palpitants, l'aile ouverte,
A la cime des bois chantent a plein gosier
Le matin qui fleurit comme un divin rosier
Dans le ciel clair raye par l'hirondelle alerte.

En greles notes d'or, sur les graviers polis,
Les eaux vives, filtrant et pleuvant goutte a goutte,
Caressent du baiser de leur leger coulis
La bruyere et le thym, les glaieuls et les lys;
Et le jeune chevreuil, que l'aube eveille, ecoute
Les eaux vives filtrant et pleuvant goutte a goutte
En greles notes d'or sur les graviers polis.

Le long des frais buissons ou rit le vent sonore,
Par le sentier qui fuit vers le lointain charmant
Ou la molle vapeur bleuit et s'evapore,
Tous deux, sous la lumiere humide de l'aurore,
S'en vont entrelaces et passent lentement
Par le sentier qui fuit vers le lointain charmant,
Le long des frais buissons ou rit le vent sonore.

La volupte d'aimer clot a demi leurs yeux,
Ils ne savent plus rien du vol de l'heure breve,
Le charme et la beaute de la terre et des cieux
Leur rendent eternel l'instant delicieux,
Et, dans l'enchantement de ce reve d'un reve,
Ils ne savent plus rien du vol de l'heure breve,
La volupte d'aimer clot a demi leurs yeux.

Dans le ciel clair raye par l'hirondelle alerte
L'aube fleurit toujours comme un divin rosier;
Mais eux, sous la feuillee etincelante et verte,
N'entendront plus, un jour, les doux nids, l'aile ouverte,
Jusqu'au fond de leur coeur chanter a plein gosier
Le matin qui fleurit comme un divin rosier
Dans le ciel clair raye par l'hirondelle alerte.


LA LAMPE DU CIEL

Par la chaine d'or des etoiles vives
La Lampe du ciel pend du sombre azur
Sur l'immense mer, les monts et les rives.
Dans la molle paix de l'air tiede et pur
Bercee au soupir des houles pensives,
La Lampe du ciel pend du sombre azur
Par la chaine d'or des etoiles vives.

Elle baigne, emplit l'horizon sans fin
De l'enchantement de sa clarte calme;
Elle argente l'ombre au fond du ravin,
Et, perlant les nids, poses sur la palme,
Qui dorment, legers, leur sommeil divin,
De l'enchantement de sa clarte calme
Elle baigne, emplit l'horizon sans fin.

Dans le doux abime, o Lune, ou tu plonges
Es-tu le soleil des morts bienheureux,
Le blanc paradis ou s'en vont leurs songes?
O monde muet, epanchant sur eux
De beaux reves faits de meilleurs mensonges,
Es-tu le soleil des morts bienheureux,
Dans le doux abime, o Lune, ou tu plonges?

Toujours, a jamais, eternellement,
Nuit! Silence! Oubli des heures ameres!
Que n'absorbez-vous le desir qui ment,
Haine, amour, pensee, angoisse et chimeres?
Que n'apaisez-vous l'antique tourment,
Nuit! Silence! Oubli des heures ameres!
Toujours, a jamais, eternellement?

Par la chaine d'or des etoiles vives,
O Lampe du ciel, qui pends de l'azur,
Tombe, plonge aussi dans la mer sans rives!
Fais un gouffre noir de l'air tiede et pur
Au dernier soupir des houles pensives,
O Lampe du ciel, qui pends de l'azur
Par la chaine d'or des etoiles vives!


SI L'AURORE

Si l'Aurore, toujours, de ses perles arrose
Cannes, gerofliers et mais onduleux;
Si le vent de la mer, qui monte aux pitons bleus,
Fait les bambous geants bruire dans l'air rose;

Hors du nid frais blotti parmi les vetivers
Si la plume ecarlate allume les feuillages;
Si l'on entend fremir les abeilles sauvages
Sur les cloches de pourpre et les calices verts;

Si le roucoulement des blondes tourterelles
Et les trilles aigus du cardinal siffleur
S'unissent ca et la sur la montagne en fleur
Au bruit de l'eau qui va mouvant les herbes greles;

Avec ses bardeaux roux jaspes de mousses d'or
Et sa varangue basse aux stores de Manille,
A l'ombred des manguiers ou grimpe la vanille
Si la maison du cher aieul repose encor;

O doux oiseaux berces sur l'aigrette des cannes,
O lumiere, o jeunesse, arome de nos bois,
Noirs ravins, qui, le long de vos apres parois,
Exhalez au soleil vos brumes diaphanes!

Salut! Je vous salue, o montagnes, o cieux,
Du paradis perdu visions infinies,
Aurores et couchants, astres des nuits benies,
Qui ne resplendirez jamais plus dans mes yeux!

Je vous salue, au bord de la tombe eternelle,
Reve sterile, espoir aveugle, desir vain,
Mirages eclatants du mensonge divin
Que l'heure irresistible emporte sur son aile!

Puisqu'il n'est, par dela nos moments revolus,
Que l'immuable oubli de nos mille chimeres,
A quoi bon se troubler des choses ephemeres?
A quoi bon le souci d'etre ou de n'etre plus?

J'ai goute peu de joie, et j'ai l'ame assouvie
Des jours nouveaux non moins que des siecles anciens.
Dans le sable sterile ou dorment tous les miens
Que ne puis-je finir le songe de la vie!

Que ne puis-je, couche sous le chiendent amer,
Chair inerte, vouee au temps qui la devore,
M'engloutir dans la nuit qui n'aura point d'aurore,
Au grondement immense et morne de la mer!


LE MANCHY

Sous un nuage frais de claire mousseline,
         Tous les dimanches au matin,
Tu venais a la ville en manchy de rotin,
         Par les rampes de la colline.

La cloche de l'eglise alertement tintait;
         Le vent de mer bercait les cannes;
Comme une grele d'or, aux pointes des savanes,
         Le feu du soleil crepitait.

Le bracelet aux poings, l'anneau sur la cheville,
         Et le mouchoir jaune aux chignons,
Deux Telingas portaient, assidus compagnons,
         Ton lit aux nattes de Manille,

Ployant leur jarret maigre et nerveux, et chantant,
         Souples dans leurs tuniques blanches,
Le bambou sur l'epaule et les mains sur les hanches,
         Ils allaient le long de l'Etang.

On voyait, au travers du rideau de batiste,
         Tes boucles dorer l'oreiller,
Et, sous leurs cils mi clos, feignant de sommeiller,
         Tes beaux yeux de sombre amethyste.

Tu t'en venais ainsi, par ces matins si doux,
         De la montagne a la grand'messe,
Dans ta grace naive et ta rose jeunesse,
         Au pas rhythme de tes Hindous.

Maintenant, dans le sable aride de nos greves,
         Sous les chiendents, au bruit des mers,
Tu reposes parmi les morts qui me sont chers,
         O charme de mes premiers reves!


LE FRAIS MATIN DORAIT

Le frais matin dorait de sa clarte premiere
La cime des bambous et des gerofliers.
Oh! les mille chansons des oiseaux familiers
Palpitant dans l'air rose et buvant la lumiere!

Comme lui tu brillais, o ma douce lumiere,
Et tu chantais comme eux vers les cieux familiers!
A l'ombre des letchis et des gerofliers,
C'etait toi que mon coeur contemplait la premiere.

Telle, au Jardin celeste, a l'aurore premiere,
La jeune Eve, sous les divins gerofliers,
Toute pareille encore aux anges familiers,
De ses yeux innocents repandait la lumiere.

Harmonie et parfum, charme, grace, lumiere,
Toi, vers qui s'envolaient mes songes familiers,
Rayon d'or effleurant les hauts gerofliers,
O lys, qui m'as verse mon ivresse premiere!

La Vierge aux pales mains t'a prise la premiere,
Chere ame! Et j'ai vecu loin des gerofliers,
Loin des sentiers charmants a tes pas familiers,
Et loin du ciel natal ou fleurit ta lumiere.

Des siecles ont passe, dans l'ombre ou la lumiere,
Et je revois toujours mes astres familiers,
Les beaux yeux qu'autrefois, sous nos gerofliers,
Le frais matin dorait de sa clarte premiere!


TRE FILA D'ORO

La-bas, sur la mer, comme l'hirondelle,
Je voudrais m'enfuir, et plus loin encor!
Mais j'ai beau vouloir, puisque la cruelle
A lie mon coeur avec trois fils d'or.

L'un est son regard, l'autre son sourire,
Le troisieme, enfin, est sa levre en fleur;
Mais je l'aime trop, c'est un vrai martyre:
Avec trois fils d'or elle a pris mon coeur!

Oh! si je pouvais denouer ma chaine!
Adieu, pleurs, tourments; je prendrais l'essor.
Mais non, non! mieux vaut mourir a la peine
Que de vous briser, o mes trois fils d'or!




BAUDELAIRE


LE GUIGNON

Pour soulever un poids si lourd,
Sisyphe, il faudrait ton courage!
Bien qu'on ait du coeur a l'ouvrage,
L'Art est long et le Temps est court.

Loin des sepultures celebres,
Vers un cimetiere isole,
Mon coeur, comme un tambour voile,
Va battant des marches funebres.

Maint joyau dort enseveli
Dans les tenebres et l'oubli,
Bien loin des pioches et des sondes;

Mainte fleur epanche a regret
Son parfum doux comme un secret
Dans les solitudes profondes.


LA VIE ANTERIEURE

J'ai longtemps habite sous de vastes portiques
Que les soleils marins teignaient de mille feux,
Et que leurs grands piliers, droits et majestueux,
Rendaient pareils, le soir, aux grottes basaltiques.

Les houles, en roulant les images des cieux,
Melaient d'une facon solennelle et mystique
Les tout-puissants accords de leur riche musique
Aux couleurs du couchant reflete par mes yeux.

C'est la que j'ai vecu dans les voluptes calmes,
Au milieu de l'azur, des vagues, des splendeurs
Et des esclaves nus, tout impregnes d'odeurs,

Qui me rafraichissaient le front avec des palmes,
Et dont l'unique soin etait d'approfondir
Le secret douloureux qui me faisait languir.


LA BEAUTE

Que diras-tu ce soir, pauvre ame solitaire,
Que diras-tu, mon coeur, coeur autrefois fletri,
A la tres-belle, a la tres-bonne, a la tres-chere,
Dont le regard divin t'a soudain refleuri ?

--Nous mettrons notre orgueil a chanter ses louanges.
Rien ne vaut la douceur de son autorite;
Sa chair spirituelle a le parfum des Anges,
Et son oeil nous revet d'un habit de clarte.

Que ce soit dans la nuit et dans la solitude,
Que ce soit dans la rue et dans la multitude,
Son fantome dans l'air danse comme un flambeau.

Parfois il parle et dit: "Je suis belle, et j'ordonne
Que pour l'amour de moi vous n'aimiez que le Beau;
Je suis l'Ange gardien, la Muse et la Madone!"


LA CLOCHE FELEE

Il est amer et doux, pendant les nuits d'hiver,
D'ecouter, pres du feu qui palpite et qui fume,
Les souvenirs lointains lentement s'elever
Au bruit des carillons qui chantent dans la brume.

Bienheureuse la cloche au gosier vigoureux
Qui, malgre sa vieillesse, alerte et bien portante,
Jette fidelement sou cri religieux,
Ainsi qu'un vieux soldat qui veille sous la tente!

Moi, mon ame est felee, et lorsqu'en ses ennuis
Elle veut de ses chants peupler l'air froid des nuits,
Il arrive souvent que sa voix affaiblie

Semble le rale epais d'un blesse qu'on oublie
Au bord d'un lac de sang, sous un grand tas de morts,
Et qui meurt, sans bouger, dans d'immenses efforts!


SPLEEN

J'ai plus de souvenirs que si j'avais mille ans.
Un gros meuble a tiroirs encombre de bilans,
De vers, de billets doux, de proces, de romances,
Avec de lourds cheveux roules dans des quittances,
Cache moins de secrets que mon triste cerveau.
C'est une pyramide, un immense caveau,
Qui contient plus de morts que la fosse commune.

--Je suis un cimetiere abhorre de la lune,
Ou, comme des remords, se trainent de longs vers
Qui s'acharnent toujours sur mes morts les plus chers.
Je suis un vieux boudoir plein de roses fanees,
Ou git tout un fouillis de modes surannees,
Ou les pastels plaintifs et les pales Boucher,
Seuls, respirent l'odeur d'un flacon debouche.

Rien n'egale en longueur les boiteuses journees,
Quand sous les lourds flocons des neigeuses annees
L'Ennui, fruit de la morne incuriosite,
Prend les proportions de l'immortalite.

--Desormais tu n'es plus, o matiere vivante!
Qu'un granit entoure d'une vague epouvante,
Assoupi dans le fond d'un Saharau brumeux!
Un vieux sphinx ignore du monde insoucieux,
Oublie sur la carte, et dont l'humeur farouche
Ne chante qu'aux rayons du soleil qui se couche!


LE GOUT DU NEANT

Morne esprit, autrefois amoureux de la lutte,
L'Espoir, dont l'eperon attisait ton ardeur,
Ne veut plus t'enfourcher! Couche-toi sans pudeur,
Vieux cheval dont le pied a chaque obstacle butte.
Resigne-toi, mon coeur; dors ton sommeil de brute.

Esprit vaincu, fourbu! Pour toi, vieux maraudeur,
L'amour n'a plus de gout, non plus que la dispute;
Adieu donc, chants du cuivre et soupirs de la flute!
Plaisirs, ne tentez plus un coeur sombre et boudeur!
Le Printemps adorable a perdu son odeur!

Et le Temps m'engloutit minute par minute,
Comme la neige immense un corps pris de roideur;
Je contemple d'en haut le globe en sa rondeur,
Et je n'y cherche plus l'abri d'une cahute!
Avalanche, veux-tu m'emporter dans ta chute?


LA RANCON

L'homme a, pour payer sa rancon,
Deux champs au tuf profond et riche,
Qu'il faut qu'il remue et defriche
Avec le fer de la raison;

Pour obtenir la moindre rose,
Pour extorquer quelques epis,
Des pleurs sales de son front gris
Sans cesse il faut qu'il les arrose.

L'un est l'Art, et l'autre l'Amour.
--Pour rendre le juge propice,
Lorsque de la stricte justice
Paraitra le terrible jour,

Il faudra lui montrer des granges
Pleines de moissons, et des fleurs
Dont les formes et les couleurs
Gagnent le suffrage des Anges.


LE COUCHER DU SOLEIL ROMANTIQUE

Que le soleil est beau quand tout frais il se leve,
Comme une explosion nous lancant son bonjour!
--Bienheureux celui-la qui peut avec amour
Saluer son coucher plus glorieux qu'un reve!

Je me souviens! ... J'ai vu tout, fleur, source, sillon
Se pamer sous son oeil comme un coeur qui palpite....
Courons vers l'horizon, il est tard, courons vite,
Pour attraper au moins un oblique rayon!

Mais je poursuis en vain le Dieu qui se retire;
L'irresistible Nuit etablit son empire,
Noire, humide, funeste et pleine de frissons;

Une odeur de tombeau dans les tenebres nage,
Et mon pied peureux froisse, au bord du marecage,
Des crapauds imprevus et de froids limacons.


HYMNE

A la tres-chere, a la tres-belle
Qui remplit mon coeur de clarte,
A l'ange, a l'idole immortelle,
Salut en immortalite!

Elle se repand dans ma vie
Comme un air impregne de sel,
Et dans mon ame inassouvie
Verse le gout de l'eternel.

Sachet toujours frais qui parfume
L'atmosphere d'un cher reduit,
Encensoir oublie qui fume
En secret a travers la nuit,

Comment, amour incorruptible,
T'exprimer avec verite?
Grain de musc qui gis, invisible,
Au fond de mon eternite!

A la tres-bonne, a la tres-belle
Qui fait ma joie et ma sante,
A l'ange, a l'idole immortelle,
Salut en immortalite!


LA MORT DES PAUVRES

C'est la Mort qui console, helas! et qui fait vivre;
C'est le but de la vie, et c'est le seul espoir
Qui, comme un elixir, nous monte et nous enivre,
Et nous donne le coeur de marcher jusqu'au soir;

A travers la tempete, et la neige, et le givre,
C'est la clarte vibrante a notre horizon noir;
C'est l'auberge fameuse inscrite sur le livre,
Ou l'on pourra manger, et dormir, et s'asseoir;

C'est un Ange qui tient dans ses doigts magnetiques
Le sommeil et le don des reves extatiques,
Et qui refait le lit des gens pauvres et nus;

C'est la gloire des Dieux, c'est le grenier mystique,
C'est la bourse du pauvre et sa patrie antique,
C'est le portique ouvert sur les d'eux inconnus!


L'HOMME ET LA MER

Homme libre, toujours tu cheriras la mer.
La mer est ton miroir; tu contemples ton ame
Dans le deroulement infini de sa lame,
Et ton esprit n'est pas un gouffre moins amer.

Tu te plais a plonger au sein de ton image;
Tu l'embrasses des yeux et des bras, et ton coeur
Se distrait quelquefois de sa propre rumeur
Au bruit de cette plainte indomptable et sauvage.

Vous etes tous les deux tenebreux et discrets:
Homme, nul n'a sonde le fond de tes abimes,
O mer, nul ne connait tes richesses intimes,
Tant vous etes jaloux de garder vos secrets!

Et cependant voila des siecles innombrables
Que vous vous combattez sans pitie ni remord,
Tellement vous aimez le carnage et la mort,
O lutteurs eternels, o freres implacables!




PIERRE DUPONT


LA VERONIQUE

Quand les chenes, a chaque branche,
Poussent leurs feuilles par milliers,
La veronique bleue et blanche
Seme les tapis a leurs pieds;
Sans haleine, a peine irisee,
Ce n'est qu'un reflet de couleur,
Pleur d'azur, goutte de rosee,
Que l'aurore a changee en fleur.

Douces a voir, o veroniques!
Vous ne durez qu'une heure ou deux,
Fugitives et sympathiques
Comme des regards amoureux.

Les violettes sont moins claires,
Les bluets moins legers que vous,
Les pervenches moins ephemeres
Et les myosotis moins doux.
Le dahlia, non plus la rose,
N'imiteront point votre azur;
Votre couleur bleue est eclose
Simplement comme un amour pur.

Douces a voir, o veroniques!
Vous ne durez qu'une heure ou deux,
Fugitives et sympathiques
Comme des regards amoureux.

Le papillon bleu vous courtise,
L'insecte vous perce le coeur,
D'un coup de bec l'oiseau vous brise,
Que guette a son tour l'oiseleur.
Reveurs, amants, race distraite,
Vous effeuilleront au hasard,
Sans voir votre grace muette.
Ni votre dernier bleu regard.

Douces a voir, o veroniques!
Vous ne durez qu'une heure ou deux,
Fugitives et sympathiques
Comme des regards amoureux.

O fleur insaisissable et pure,
Saphir dont nul ne sait le prix,
Melez-vous a la chevelure
De celle dont je suis epris;
Pointillez dans la mousseline
De son blanc peignoir entr'ouvert,
Et dans la porcelaine fine
Ou sa levre boit le the vert.

Douces a voir, o veroniques!
Vous ne durez qu'une heure ou deux,
Fugitives et sympathiques
Comme des regards amoureux.

Fleurs touchantes du sacrifice,
Mortes, vous savez nous guerir;
Je vois dans votre humble calice
Le ciel entier s'epanouir.
O veroniques! sous les chenes
Fleurissez pour les simples coeurs
Qui, dans les traverses humaines,
Vont cherchant les petites fleurs.

Douces a voir, o veroniques!
Vous ne durez qu'une heure ou deux,
Fugitives et sympathiques
Comme des regards amoureux.


LES BOEUFS

J'ai deux grands boeufs dans mon etable,
Deux grands boeufs blancs, marques de roux;
La charrue est en bois d'erable,
L'aiguillon en branche de houx;
C'est par leur soin qu'on voit la plaine
Verte l'hiver, jaune l'ete;
Ils gagnent dans une semaine
Plus d'argent qu'ils n'en ont coute.

     S'il me fallait les vendre,
     J'aimerais mieux me pendre;
J'aime Jeanne ma femme, eh bien! j'aimerais mieux
     La voir mourir, que voir mourir mes boeufs.

Les voyez-vous, les belles betes,
Creuser profond et tracer droit,
Bravant la pluie et les tempetes,
Qu'il fasse chaud, qu'il fasse froid?
Lorsque je fais halte pour boire,
Un brouillard sort de leurs naseaux,
Et je vois sur leur corne noire
Se poser les petits oiseaux.
    S'il me fallait les vendre, etc.

Ils sont forts comme un pressoir d'huile,
Ils sont doux comme des moutons.
Tous les ans on vient de la ville
Les marchander dans nos cantons,
Pour les mener aux Tuileries,
Au mardi gras devant le roi,
Et puis les vendre aux boucheries,
Je ne veux pas, ils sont a moi.
    S'il me fallait les vendre, etc.

Quand notre fille sera grande,
Si le fils de notre regent
En mariage la demande,
Je lui promets tout mon argent;
Mais si pour dot il veut qu'on donne
Les grands boeufs blancs, marques de roux,
Ma fille, laissons la couronne,
Et ramenons les boeufs chez nous.
    S'il me fallait les vendre, etc.


LE CHANT DES OUVRIERS

Nous, dont la lampe, le matin,
Au clairon du coq se rallume;
Nous tous, qu'un salaire incertain
Ramene avant l'aube a l'enclume;
Nous, qui des bras, des pieds, des mains.
De tout le corps, luttons sans cesse,
Sans abriter nos lendemains
Contre le froid de la vieillesse,

Aimons-nous, et quand nous pouvons
Nous unir pour boire a la ronde,
Que le canon se taise ou gronde,
          Buvons
A l'independance du monde!

Nos bras, sans relache tendus,
Aux flots jaloux, au sol avare,
Ravissent leurs tresors perdus,
Ce qui nourrit et ce qui pare:
Perles, diamants et metaux,
Fruit du coteau, grain de la plaine.
Pauvres moutons, quels bons manteaux
Il se tisse avec notre laine!
Aimons-nous, etc.

Quel fruit tirons-nous des labeurs
Qui courbent nos maigres echines?
Ou vont les flots de nos sueurs?
Nous ne sommes que des machines.
Nos Babels montent jusqu'au ciel,
La terre nous doit ses merveilles!
Des qu'elles ont fini le miel
Le maitre chasse les abeilles.
Aimons-nous, etc.

Mal vetus, loges dans des trous,
Sous les combles, dans les decombres,
Nous vivons avec les hiboux
Et les larrons, amis des ombres:
Cependant notre sang vermeil
Coule impetueux dans nos veines;
Nous nous plairions au grand soleil,
Et sous les rameaux verts des chenes!
Aimons-nous, etc.

A chaque fois que par torrents
Notre sang coule sur le monde,
C'est toujours pour quelques tyrans
Que cette rosee est feconde;
Menageons-le dorenavant,
L'amour est plus fort que la guerre;
En attendant qu'un meilleur vent
Souffle du ciel ou de la terre,
Aimons-nous, etc.


LE REPOS DU SOIR

Quand le soleil se couche horizontal,
De longs rayons noyant la plaine immense,
Comme un ble mur, le ciel occidental
De pourpre vive et d'or pur se nuance;
L'ombre est plus grande et la clarte s'eteint

Sur le versant des pentes opposees;
Enfin, le ciel, par degres, se deteint,
Le jour s'efface en des brumes rosees.
          Reposons-nous!
      Le repos est si doux:
      Que la peine sommeille
      Jusqu'a l'aube vermeille!

Dans le sillon, la charrue, au repos,
Attend l'aurore et la terre mouillee;
Bergers, comptez et parquez les troupeaux,
L'oiseau s'endort dans l'epaisse feuillee.
Gaules en main, bergeres, aux doux yeux,

A l'eau des gues menent leurs betes boire;
Les laboureurs vont delier les boeufs,
Et les chevaux soufflent dans la mangeoire.
          Reposons-nous! etc.

Tous les fuseaux s'arretent dans les doigts,
La lampe brille, une blanche fumee
Dans l'air du soir monte de tous les toits;
C'est du repas l'annonce accoutumee.
Les ouvriers, si las, quand vient la nuit,
Peuvent partir; enfin, la cloche sonne,
Ils vont gagner leur modeste reduit,
Ou, sur le feu, la marmite bouillonne.
          Reposons-nous! etc.

La menagere et les enfants sont la,
Du chef de l'atre attendant la presence:
Des qu'il parait, un grand cri: "Le voila!"
S'eleve au ciel, comme en rejouissance;
De bons baisers, la soupe, un doigt de vin,
Rendent la joie a sa figure bleme;
Il peut dormir, ses enfants ont du pain,
Et n'a-t-il pas une femme qui l'aime?
          Reposons-nous! etc.

Tous les foyers s'eteignent lentement;
Dans le lointain, une usine, qui fume,
Pousse de terre un sourd mugissement;
Les lourds marteaux expirent sur l'enclume.
Ah! detournons nos ames du vain bruit,
Et nos regards du faux eclat des villes:
Endormons-nous sous l'aile de la nuit
Qui mene en rond ses etoiles tranquilles!
          Reposons-nous! etc.




ANDRE LEMOYNE


CHANSON MARINE

Nous revenions d'un long voyage,
Las de la mer et las du ciel.
Le banc d'azur du cap Frehel
Fut salue par l'equipage.

Bientot nous vimes s'elargir
Les blanches courbes de nos greves;
Puis, au cher pays de nos reves,
L'aiguille des clochers surgir.

Le son d'or des cloches normandes
Jusqu'a nous s'egrenait dans l'air;
Nous arrivions par un temps clair,
Marchant a voiles toutes grandes.

De loin nous fumes reconnus
Par un vol de mouettes blanches,
Oiseaux de Granville et d'Avranches,
Pour nous revoir expres venus.

Ils nous disaient: "L'Orne et la Vire
Savent deja votre retour,
Et c'est avant la fin du jour
Que doit mouiller votre navire.

"Vous n'avez pas compte les pleurs
Des vieux peres qui vous attendent.
Les hirondelles vous demandent,
Et tous vos pommiers sont en fleurs.

"Nous connaissons de belles filles,
Aux coiffes en moulin a vent,
Qui de vous ont parle souvent,
Au feu du soir dans vos familles.

"Et nous en avons pris conge
Pour vous rejoindre a tire-d'ailes,
Vous avez trop vecu loin d'elles,
Mais pas un seul coeur n'a change."


UN FLEUVE A LA MER

Quand un grand fleuve a fait trois ou quatre cents lieues
Et longtemps promene ses eaux vertes ou bleues
Sous le ciel refroidi de l'ancien continent,
C'est un voyageur las, qui va d'un flot trainant.

Il n'a pas vu la mer, mais il l'a pressentie.
Par de lointains reflux sa marche est ralentie.

Le desert, le silence accompagnent ses bords.
Adieu les arbres verts.--Les tristes fleurs des landes,
Bouquets de romarins et touffes de lavandes,
Lui versent les parfums qu'on repand sur les morts.

Le seul oiseau qui plane au fond du paysage,
C'est le goeland gris, c'est l'eternel presage
Apparaissant le soir qu'un fleuve doit mourir,
Quand le grand inconnu devant lui va s'ouvrir.




DE BANVILLE


LA CHANSON DE MA MIE

L'eau dans les grands lacs bleus
      Endormie,
Est le miroir des cieux:
Mais j'aime mieux les yeux
      De ma mie.

Pour que l'ombre parfois
      Nous sourie,
Un oiseau chante au bois,
Mais j'aime mieux la voix
      De ma mie.

La rosee, a la fleur
      Defleurie
Rend sa vive couleur;
Mais j'aime mieux un pleur
      De ma mie.

Le temps vient tout briser.
      On l'oublie:
Moi, pour le mepriser,
Je ne veux qu'un baiser
      De ma mie.

La rose sur le lin
      Meurt fletrie;
J'aime mieux pour coussin
Les levres et le sein
      De ma mie.

On change tour a tour
      De folie
Moi, jusqu'au dernier jour,
Je m'en tiens a l'amour
      De ma mie.


A ADOLPHE GAIFFE

Jeune homme sans melancolie,
Blond comme un soleil d'Italie,
Garde bien ta belle folie.

C'est la sagesse! Aimer le vin,
La beaute, le printemps divin,
Cela suffit. Le reste est vain.

Souris, meme au destin severe!
Et quand revient la primevere,
Jettes-en les fleurs dans ton verre.

Au corps sous la tombe enferme
Que reste-t-il? D'avoir aime
Pendant deux ou trois mois de mai.

"Cherchez les effets et les causes,"
Nous disent les reveurs moroses.
Des mots! des mots! cueillons les roses.


BALLADE DES PENDUS

Sur ses larges bras etendus,
La foret ou s'eveille Flore,
A des chapelets de pendus
Que le matin caresse et dore.
Ce bois sombre, ou le chene arbore
Des grappes de fruits inouis
Meme chez le Turc et le More,
C'est le verger du roi Louis.

Tous ces pauvres gens morfondus,
Roulant des pensers qu'on ignore,
Dans les tourbillons eperdus
Voltigent, palpitants encore.
Le soleil levant les devore.
Regardez-les, cieux eblouis,
Danser dans les feux de l'aurore.
C'est le verger du roi Louis.

Ces pendus, du diable entendus,
Appellent des pendus encore.
Tandis qu'aux cieux, d'azur tendus,
Ou semble luire un meteore,
La rosee en l'air s'evapore,
Un essaim d'oiseaux rejouis
Par dessus leur tete picore.
C'est le verger du roi Louis.

ENVOI

"Prince, il est un bois que decore
Un tas de pendus enfouis
Dans le doux feuillage sonore.
C'est le verger du roi Louis."




HENRI DE BORNIER


RESIGNONS-NOUS

C'est la saison des avalanches;
Le bois est noir, le ciel est gris,
Les corbeaux dans les plaines blanches,
Par milliers, volent a grands cris;
--Mais, bientot, de tiedes haleines
Descendront du ciel moins jaloux,
Avril consolera les plaines....
    Resignons-nous.

C'est l'orage! Les eaux flamboient
En se heurtant comme des blocs,
Les dogues de l'abime aboient
Et hurlent en mordant les rocs;
--Mais demain tous ces flots rebelles
Se changeront, unis et doux,
En miroirs pour les hirondelles....
    Resignons-nous.

C'est l'age ou l'homme nie et doute:
Soleils couches et reves morts!
A chaque tournant de la route,
Ou des regrets ou des remords!
--Mais, bientot, viendra la vieillesse
Elevant sur nos fronts a tous
La lampe d'or de la sagesse....
    Resignons-nous.

Ceux qu'on aima sont dans les tombes,
Les yeux adores sont eteints,
Dieu rappelle a lui nos colombes
Pour rejouir des cieux lointains....
--Mais, bientot, d'une ame ravie,
Seigneur! pour les rejoindre en vous,
Nous nous enfuirons de la vie....
    Resignons-nous.

BRUNETTE

Voici qu'avril est de retour,
Mais le soleil n'est plus le meme,
Ni le printemps, depuis le jour
Ou j'ai perdu celle que j'aime.

Je m'en suis alle par les bois.
La foret verte etait si pleine,
Si pleine des fleurs d'autrefois,
Que j'ai senti grandir ma peine.

J'ai dit aux beaux muguets tremblants:
"N'avez-vous pas vu ma mignonne?"
J'ai dit aux ramiers roucoulants:
"N'avez-vous rencontre personne?"

Mais les ramiers sont restes sourds,
Et sourde aussi la fleur nouvelle,
Et depuis je cherche toujours
Le chemin qu'a pris l'infidele.

L'amour, l'amour qu'on aime tant,
Est comme une montagne haute:
On la monte tout en chantant,
On pleure en descendant la cote.


LES PAYSANS

Le village s'eveille a la corne du patre;
Les betes et les gens sortent de leur logis;
On les voit cheminer sous le brouillard bleuatre,
Dans le frisson mouille des alisiers rougis.

Par les sentiers pierreux et les branches froissees,
Coupeurs de bois, faucheurs de foin, semeurs de ble,
Ruminant lourdement de confuses pensees,
Marchent, le front courbe sur leur poitrail hale.

La besogne des champs est rude et solitaire:
De la blancheur de l'aube a l'obscure lueur
Du soir tombant, il faut se battre avec la terre
Et laisser sur chaque herbe un peu de sa sueur.

Paysans, race antique a la glebe asservie,
Le soleil cuit vos reins, le froid tord vos genoux;
Pourtant si l'on pouvait recommencer sa vie,
Freres, je voudrais naitre et grandir parmi vous!

Petri de votre sang, nourri dans un village,
Respirant des odeurs d'etable et de fenil,
Et courant en plein air comme un poulain sauvage
Qui se vautre et bondit dans les pousses d'avril,

J'aurais en moi peut-etre alors assez de seve,
Assez de flamme au coeur et d'energie au corps,
Pour chanter dignement le monde qui s'eleve
Et dont vous serez, vous, les maitres durs et forts.

Car votre regne arrive, o paysans de France;
Le penseur voit monter vos flots lointains encor,
Comme on voit s'eveiller dans une plaine immense
L'ondulation calme et lente des bles d'or.

L'avenir est a vous, car vous vivez sans cesse
Accouples a la terre, et sur son large sein
Vous buvez a longs traits la force et la jeunesse
Dans un embrassement laborieux et sain.

Le vieux monde se meurt. Dans les plus nobles veines
Le sang bleu des aieux, appauvri, s'est fige,
Et le prestige ancien des races souveraines
Comme un soleil mourant dans l'ombre s'est plonge.

L'avenir est a vous!... Nos ecoles sont pleines
De fils de vignerons et de fils de fermiers;
Trempes dans l'air des bois et les eaux des fontaines,
Ils sont partout en nombre et partout les premiers.

Salut! Vous arrivez, nous partons. Vos fenetres
S'ouvrent sur le plein jour, les notres sur la nuit....
Ne nous imitez pas, quand vous serez nos maitres,
Demeurez dans vos champs ou le grand soleil luit....

Ne reniez jamais vos humbles origines,
Soyez comme le chene au tronc noueux et dur;
Dans la terre enfoncez vaillamment vos racines,
Tandis que vos rameaux verdissent dans l'azur.

Car la terre qui fait murir les moissons blondes
Et dans les pampres verts monter l'ame du vin,
La terre est la nourrice aux mamelles fecondes;
Celui-la seul est fort qui boit son lait divin.

Pour avoir dedaigne ses rudes embrassades,
Nous n'avons plus aux mains qu'un lambeau de pouvoir,
Et, pareils desormais a des enfants malades,
Ayant peur d'obeir et n'osant plus vouloir,

Nous attendons, tremblants et la mine effaree,
L'heure ou vous tous, bouviers, laboureurs, vignerons,
Vous epandrez partout comme un ras de maree
Vos flots victorieux ou nous disparaitrons.




GEORGES LAFENESTRE


L'EBAUCHE

_Sur une statue inachevee de Michel-Ange._

Comme un agonisant cache, les levres blanches,
Sous des draps en sueur dont ses bras et ses hanches
Soulevent par endroits les grands plis distendus,
Au fond du bloc taille brusquement comme un arbre,
On devine, ralant sous le manteau de marbre,
Le geant qu'il ecrase et ses membres tordus.

Impuissance ou degout, le ciseau du vieux maitre
N'a pas a son captif donne le temps de naitre,
A l'ame impatiente il a nie son corps;
Et, depuis trois cents ans, l'informe creature,
Nuits et jours, pour briser son enveloppe obscure,
Du coude et du genou fait d'horribles efforts.

Sous le grand ciel brulant, pres des noirs terebinthes,
Dans les fraiches villas et les coupoles peintes,
L'appellent vainement ses aines glorieux:
Comme un jardin ferme dont la senteur l'enivre,
Le maudit voit la vie, il s'elance, il veut vivre...
Arriere! Ou sont tes pieds pour t'en aller vers eux ?

Va, je plains, je comprends, je connais ta torture.
Nul ouvrier n'est rude autant que la Nature;
Nul sculpteur ne la vaut, dans ses jours souverains,
Pour encombrer le sol d'inutiles ebauches
Qu'on voit se demener, lourdes, plates et gauches,
En des destins manques qui leur brisent les reins.

Elle aussi, des l'aurore, elle chante et se leve,
Pour petrir au soleil les formes de son reve,
Avec ses bras vaillants, dans l'argile des morts,
Puis, tout d'un coup, lachant sa besogne, en colere,
Pele mele, en un coin, les jette a la poussiere,
Avec des moities d'ame et des moities de corps.

Nul ne les comptera, ces victimes etranges,
Risibles avortons trebuchant dans leurs langes,
Qui tatent le vent chaud de leurs yeux endormis,
Monstres mal copies sur de trop beaux modeles
Qui, de leur coeur fragile et de leurs membres greles,
S'efforcent au bonheur qu'on leur avait promis.

Vastes foules d'humains flagelles par les fievres!
Ceux-la, tous les fruits murs leur echappent des levres.
La maratre brutale en finit-elle un seul?
Non. Chez tous le desir est plus grand que la force;
Comme l'arbre, au printemps, dechire son ecorce,
Chacun, pour en jaillir, s'agite en son linceul.

Qu'en dis-tu, lamentable et sublime statue?
Ta force, a ce combat, doit-elle etre abattue?
As-tu soif, a la fin, de ce muet neant
Ou nous dormions si bien dans les roches inertes,
Avant qu'on nous montrat les portes entr'ouvertes
D'un ironique Eden qu'un glaive nous defend?

Ah! nous sommes bien pris dans la matiere infame:
Je n'allongerai pas les chaines de mon ame,
Tu ne sortiras pas de ton cachot epais.
Quand l'artiste, homme ou dieu, lasse de sa pensee,
Abandonne au hasard une oeuvre commencee,
Son bras indifferent n'y retourne jamais.

Pour nous le mieux serait d'attendre et de nous taire
Dans le moule borne qu'il lui plut de nous faire,
Sans force et sans beaute, sans parole et sans yeux.
Mais non! le resigne ressemble trop au lache,
Et tous deux vers le ciel nous crirons sans relache,
Maudissant Michel-Ange, et reclamant des dieux!


LE PLONGEUR

Comme un marin hardi que la cloche aux flancs lourds
Sous,l'amas des grands flots refoules avec peine
Depose, en fremissant, dans la terreur sereine
Des vieux gouffres muets, immobiles et sourds,

Quand le poete pale, en descendant toujours,
Tout a coup a heurte le fond de l'ame humaine,
L'abime etonne montre a sa vue incertaine
D'etranges habitants dans d'etranges sejours:

Sous les enlacements des goemons livides
Blanchissent de vieux mats et des squelettes vides:
Des reptiles glaces circulent alentour;

Mais lui, poussant du pied l'ignoble pourriture,
Sans se tromper poursuit sa sublime aventure,
Prend la perle qui brille, et la rapporte au jour!




FELIX FRANK


C'ETAIT UN VIEUX LOGIS

C'etait un vieux logis dans une etroite rue,
Tout petit et perche bien haut sur l'escalier;
Mais un flot de soleil y rechauffait la vue
En frappant, le matin, au carreau familier.

C'etait un vieux logis ou circulait une ame,
Ou les meubles anciens, aux details ingenus,
Dans les angles amis jetaient comme une flamme
Et riaient doucement sous les regards connus.

C'etait un vieux logis ou la famille entiere
Avait groupe longtemps ses arides travaux,
Ses efforts qu'animait une volonte fiere,
Et ces reves du coeur, toujours chers et nouveaux!

Jours passes, jours sacres jusqu'en vos amertumes,
Dans ce pauvre logis vous etiez enfermes;
Ah! qu'il est triste et doux, l'endroit ou nous vecumes
Souffrant, aimant, heureux de nous sentir aimes!

Entre les quatre murs d'une chambre modeste,
Qui dira ce que l'homme entasse de tresors?
Tresors faits de sa vie, et dont il ne lui reste
Qu'un pale souvenir et qu'un songe au dehors!....

Quand il fallut partir de la vieille demeure;
Quand il fallut partir,--l'ayant bien decide,--
La, tel qu'un faible enfant, j'ai perdu plus d'une heure
A penser, a pleurer, seul, dans l'ombre accoude.

--"C'etait un vieux logis!" murmurait la Sagesse,
"Un logis plein d'amour!" disait le coeur tremblant;
"C'etait un vieux logis plein d'intime richesse:
Prendras-tu ta jeunesse aux murs, en t'en allant?

"C'est la qu'elle vibrait! La qu'elle s'est levee,
Radieuse et chantant les clairs matins d'avril!
C'est la que d'esperance elle fut abreuvee,--
Comme on vole au bonheur, s'elancant au peril!

"C'est la qu'elle versa ses premiers pleurs d'ivresse,
Qu'elle eut ses premiers cris et ses premiers sanglots!
Tout ici lui gardait une chaude caresse;
Qu'elle s'acheve ailleurs, loin de ces vieux echos!

"Jadis il existait des foyers toujours stables:
Qui les avait quittes, y pouvait revenir;
C'est de la que sortaient ces ames indomptables
Dont le passe puissant ombrageait l'avenir.

"Aujourd'hui la maison est une hotellerie:
On arrive, on se couche, on s'eveille, et l'on part;
Et d'aucuns aujourd'hui veulent que la Patrie
Soit une auberge aussi, dediee au hasard!

"Et pourtant le Progres et la libre Justice
N'exigent pas que l'homme erre jusqu'a la mort;
Et pourtant il est bon que chacun se batisse
Un nid, pour y garder tout ce qu'il tient du sort!

"Mais c'est la loi de l'or,--c'est le gain,-- c'est la fievre
De ce siecle agite d'un etrange tourment,
Qui partout nous poursuit, et nous chasse, et nous sevre
De ce bonheur si pur, si calme et si charmant!

"Donc rien n'est ferme et fort desormais, rien ne dure:
Et comme un vil bagage, a l'aventure, on va
Cahotant son passe dans la lourde voiture
Qu'au premier coin de rue --hier au soir-- on trouva.

"En route! Voici l'heure et le logis est vide:
Reves, propos emus, passe vivant ... adieu!--
C'etait un vieux logis ou vint plus d'une ride;
Mais l'age, dans les coeurs, y retardait un peu.

"C'etait un vieux logis dans une etroite rue,
Tout petit et perche bien haut sur l'escalier;
Mais un flot de soleil y rechauffait la vue
En frappant, le matin, au carreau familier."




ARMAND SILVESTRE


LE PELERINAGE

Apres vingt ans d'exil, de cet exil impie
Ou l'oubli de nos coeurs enchaine seul nos pas,
Ou la fragilite de nos regrets s'expie,
Apres vingt ans d'exil que je ne comptais pas,

J'ai revu la maison lointaine et bien-aimee
Ou je revais, enfant, de soleils sans declin,
Ou je sentais mon ame a tous les maux fermee,
Et dont, un jour de deuil, je sortis orphelin.

J'ai revu la maison et le doux coin de terre
Ou mon souvenir seul fait passer, sous mes yeux,
Mon pere souriant avec un front austere
Et ma mere pensive avec un front joyeux.

Rien n'y semblait change des choses bien connues
Dont le charme autrefois bornait mon horizon:
Les arbres familiers, le long des avenues,
Semaient leurs feuilles d'or sur le meme gazon;

Le berceau de bois mort qu'un chevrefeuille enlace,
Le banc de pierre aux coins par la mousse mordus,
Ainsi qu'aux anciens jours tout etait a sa place
Et les hotes anciens y semblaient attendus.

Ma mere allait venir, entre ses mains lassees
Balancant une fleur sur l'or pale du soir;
Au pied du vieux tilleul, gardien de ses pensees,
Son Horace a la main, mon pere allait s'asseoir.

Tous deux me chercheraient des yeux dans les allees
Ou de mes premiers jeux la gaite s'envola;
Tous deux m'appelleraient avec des voix troublees
Et seraient malheureux ne me voyant pas la.

J'allais franchir le seuil:--C'est moi, c'est moi, mon pere!....
Mais ces rires, ces voix, je ne les connais pas.
Pour tout ce qu'enfermait ce pauvre enclos de pierre,
J'etais un etranger!... Je detournai mes pas....

Mais, par-dessus le mur, une aubepine blanche
Tendait jusqu'a mes mains son feuillage odorant.
Je compris sa pitie! J'en cueillis une branche,
Et j'emportai la fleur solitaire en pleurant!




ALBERT GLATIGNY


BALLADE DES ENFANTS SANS SOUCI

Ils vont pieds nus le plus souvent. L'hiver
Met a leurs doigts des mitaines d'onglee.
Le soir, helas! ils soupent du grand air,
Et sur leur front la bise echevelee
Gronde, pareille au bruit d'une melee,
A peine un peu leur sort est adouci
Quand avril fuit la terre consolee.
Ayez pitie des Enfants sans souci.

Ils n'ont sur eux que le manteau du ver,
Quand les frissons de la voute etoilee
Font tressaillir et briller leur oeil clair.
Par la montagne abrupte et la vallee,
Ils vont, ils vont! A leur troupe affolee
Chacun repond: "Vous n'etes pas d'ici,
Prenez ailleurs, oiseaux, votre volee."
Ayez pitie des Enfants sans souci.

Un froid de mort fait dans leur pauvre chair
Glacer le sang, et leur veine est gelee.
Les coeurs pour eux se cuirassent de fer.
Le trepas vient. Ils vont sans mausolee
Pourrir au coin d'un champs ou d'une allee,
Et les corbeaux mangent leur corps transi
Que lavera la froide giboulee.
Ayez pitie des Enfants sans souci.

ENVOI

Pour cette vie effroyable, filee
De mal, de peine, ils te disent: Merci!
Muse, comme eux, avec eux, exilee.
Ayez pitie des Enfants sans souci!




SULLY PRUDHOMME


LES CHAINES

J'ai voulu tout aimer et je suis malheureux,
Car j'ai de mes tourments multiplie les causes;
D'innombrables liens freles et douloureux
Dans l'univers entier vont de mon ame aux choses.

Tout m'attire a la fois et d'un attrait pareil:
Le vrai par ses lueurs, l'inconnu par ses voiles;
Un trait d'or fremissant joint mon coeur au soleil
Et de longs fils soyeux l'unissent aux etoiles.

La cadence m'enchaine a l'air melodieux,
La douceur du velours aux roses que je touche;
D'un sourire j'ai fait la chaine de mes yeux,
Et j'ai fait d'un baiser la chaine de ma bouche.

Ma vie est suspendue a ces fragiles noeuds,
Et je suis le captif des mille etres que j'aime:
Au moindre ebranlement qu'un souffle cause en eux
Je sens un peu de moi s'arracher de moi-meme.


LE VASE BRISE

Le vase ou meurt cette verveine
D'un coup d'eventail fut fele;
Le coup dut effleurer a peine.
Aucun bruit ne l'a revele.

Mais la legere meurtrissure,
Mordant le cristal chaque jour,
D'une marche invisible et sure
En a fait lentement le tour.

Son eau fraiche a fui goutte a goutte,
Le suc des fleurs s'est epuise;
Personne encore ne s'en doute,
N'y touchez pas, il est brise.

Souvent aussi la main qu'on aime,
Effleurant le coeur, le meurtrit;
Puis le coeur se fend de lui-meme,
La fleur de son amour perit;

Toujours intact aux yeux du monde,
Il sent croitre et pleurer tout bas
Sa blessure fine et profonde,
Il est brise, n'y touchez pas.


A L'HIRONDELLE

Toi qui peux monter solitaire
Au ciel, sans gravir les sommets,
Et dans les vallons de la terre
Descendre sans tomber jamais;

Toi qui, sans te pencher au fleuve
Ou nous ne puisons qu'a genoux,
Peux aller boire avant qu'il pleuve
Au nuage trop haut pour nous;

Toi qui pars au declin des roses
Et reviens au nid printanier,
Fidele aux deux meilleures choses,
L'independance et le foyer;

Comme toi mon ame s'eleve
Et tout a coup rase le sol,
Et suit avec l'aile du reve
Les beaux meandres de ton vol;

S'il lui faut aussi des voyages,
Il lui faut son nid chaque jour;
Elle a tes deux besoins sauvages:
Libre vie, immuable amour.


ICI-BAS

Ici-bas tous les lilas meurent,
Tous les chants des oiseaux sont courts
Je reve aux etes qui demeurent
         Toujours....

Ici-bas les levres effleurent
Sans rien laisser de leur velours;
Je reve aux baisers qui demeurent
         Toujours....

Ici-bas tous les hommes pleurent
Leurs amities ou leurs amours;
Je reve aux couples qui demeurent
         Toujours....


INTUS

Deux voix s'elevent tour a tour
Des profondeurs troubles de l'ame;
La raison blaspheme, et l'amour
Reve un Dieu juste et le proclame.

Pantheiste, athee, ou chretien,
Tu connais leurs luttes obscures;
C'est mon martyre, et c'est le tien,
De vivre avec ces deux murmures.

L'intelligence dit au coeur:
--"Le monde n'a pas un bon pere,
Vois, le mal est partout vainqueur."
Le coeur dit: "Je crois et j'espere;

Espere, o ma soeur, crois un peu,
C'est a force d'aimer qu'on trouve;
Je suis immortel, je sens Dieu."
--L'intelligence lui di: "Prouve."


LES YEUX

Bleus ou noirs, tous aimes, tous beaux,
Des yeux sans nombre ont vu l'aurore;
Ils dorment au fond des tombeaux
Et le soleil se leve encore.

Les nuits, plus douces que les jours,
Ont enchante des yeux sans nombre;
Les etoiles brillent toujours
Et les yeux se sont remplis d'ombre.

Oh! qu'ils aient perdu le regard,
Non, non, cela n'est pas possible!
Ils se sont tournes quelque part
Vers ce qu'on nomme l'invisible;

Et comme les astres penchants
Nous quittent, mais au ciel demeurent,
Les prunelles ont leurs couchants,
Mais il n'est pas vrai qu'elles meurent:

Bleus ou noirs, tous aimes, tous beaux,
Ouverts a quelque immense aurore,
De l'autre cote des tombeaux
Les yeux qu'on ferme voient encore.


L'IDEAL

La lune est grande, le ciel clair
Et plein d'astres, la terre est bleme,
Et l'ame du monde est dans l'air.
Je reve a l'etoile supreme,

A celle qu'on n'apercoit pas,
Mais dont la lumiere voyage
Et doit venir jusqu'ici-bas
Enchanter les yeux d'un autre age.

Quand luira cette etoile, un jour,
La plus belle et la plus lointaine,
Dites-lui qu'elle eut mon amour,
O derniers de la race humaine!


SEPARATION

Je ne devais pas vous le dire;
Mes pleurs, plus forts que la vertu,
Mouillant mon douloureux sourire,
Sont alles sur vos mains ecrire
L'aveu brulant que j'avais tu.

Danser, babiller, rire ensemble,
Ces jeux ne nous sont plus permis:
Vous rougissez, et moi je tremble,
Je ne sais ce qui nous rassemble,
Mais nous ne sommes plus amis.

Disposez de nous, voici l'heure
Ou je ne puis vous parler bas
Sans que l'amitie change ou meure:
Oh! dites-moi qu'elle demeure,
Je sens qu'elle ne suffit pas.

Si le langage involontaire
De mes larmes vous a deplu,
Eh bien, suivons chacun sur terre
Notre sentier; moi, solitaire,
Vous, heureuse, au bras de l'elu.

Je voyais nos deux coeurs eclore
Comme un couple d'oiseaux chantants;
Eveilles par la meme aurore,
Ils n'ont pas pris leur vol encore,
Separons-les, il en est temps;

Separons-les a leur naissance,
De crainte qu'un jour a venir,
Malheureux d'une longue absence,
Ils n'aillent dans le vide immense
Se chercher sans pouvoir s'unir.


QUI PEUT DIRE

Qui peut dire: mes yeux ont oublie l'aurore?
Qui peut dire: c'est fait de mon premier amour?
Quel vieillard le dira si son coeur bat encore,
S'il entend, s'il respire et voit encor le jour?

Est-ce qu'au fond des yeux ne reste pas l'empreinte
Des premiers traits cheris qui les ont fait pleurer?
Est ce qu'au fond du coeur n'ont pas du demeurer
La marque et la chaleur de la premiere etreinte?

Quand aux feux du soleil a succede la nuit,
Toujours au meme endroit du vaste et sombre voile
Une invisible main fixe la meme etoile
Qui se leve sur nous silencieuse et luit....

Telles, je sens au coeur, quand tous les bruits du monde
Me laissent triste et seul apres m'avoir lasse,
La presence eternelle et la douceur profonde
De mon premier amour que j'avais cru passe.


LE LEVER DU SOLEIL

Le grand soleil, plonge dans un royal ennui,
Brule au desert des cieux. Sous les traits qu'en silence
Il disperse et rappelle incessamment a lui,
Le choeur grave et lointain des spheres se balance.

Suspendu dans l'abime il n'est ni haut ni bas;
Il ne prend d'aucun feu le feu qu'il communique;
Son regard ne s'eleve et ne s'abaisse pas;
Mais l'univers se dore a sa jeunesse antique.

Flamboyant, invisible a force de splendeur,
Il est pere des bles, qui sont peres des races,
Mais il ne peuple pas son immense rondeur
D'un troupeau de mortels turbulents et voraces.

Parmi les globes noirs qu'il empourpre et conduit
Aux blemes profondeurs que l'air leger fait bleues,
La terre lui soumet la courbe qu'elle suit,
Et cherche sa caresse a d'innombrables lieues.

Sur son axe qui vibre et tourne, elle offre au jour
Son epaisseur enorme et sa face vivante,
Et les champs et les mers y viennent tour a tour
Se teindre d'une aurore eternelle et mouvante.

Mais les hommes epars n'ont que des pas bornes,
Avec le sol natal ils emergent ou plongent:
Quand les uns du sommeil sortent illumines,
Les autres dans la nuit s'enfoncent et s'allongent.

Ah! les fils de l'Hellade, avec des yeux nouveaux
Admirant cette gloire a l'Orient eclose,
Criaient: Salut au dieu dont les quatre chevaux
Frappent d'un pied d'argent le ciel solide et rose!

Nous autres nous crions: Salut a l'Infini!
Au grand Tout, a la fois idole, temple et pretre,
Qui tient fatalement l'homme a la terre uni,
Et la terre au soleil, et chaque etre a chaque etre;

Il est tombe pour nous le rideau merveilleux
Ou du vrai monde erraient les fausses apparences,
La science a vaincu l'imposture des yeux,
L'homme a repudie les vaines esperances;

Le ciel a fait l'aveu de son mensonge ancien,
Et depuis qu'on a mis ses piliers a l'epreuve,
Il apparait plus stable affranchi de soutien,
Et l'univers entier vet une beaute neuve.


A UN DESESPERE

Tu veux toi-meme ouvrir ta tombe:
Tu dis que sous ta lourde croix
Ton energie enfin succombe;
Tu souffres beaucoup, je te crois.

Le souci des choses divines
Que jamais tes yeux ne verront,
Tresse d'invisibles epines
Et les enfonce dans ton front.

Tu repands ton enthousiasme
Et tu partages ton manteau,
A ta vaillance le sarcasme
Attache un risible ecriteau.

Tu demandes a l'apre etude
Le secret du bonheur humain,
Et les clous de l'ingratitude
Te sont plantes dans chaque main.

Tu veux voler ou vont tes reves,
Et forcer l'infini jaloux,
Et tu te sens, quand tu t'enleves,
Aux deux pieds d'invisibles clous.

Ta bouche abhorre le mensonge,
La poesie y fait son miel,
Tu sens d'une invisible eponge
Monter le vinaigre et le fiel.

Ton coeur timide aime en silence,
Il cherche un coeur sous la beaute,
Tu sens d'une invisible lance
Le fer froid percer ton cote.

Tu souffres d'un mal qui t'honore,
Mais vois tes mains, tes pieds, ton flanc:
Tu n'es pas un vrai Christ encore,
On n'a pas fait couler ton sang;

Tu n'as pas arrose la terre
De la plus chaude des sueurs,
Tu n'es pas martyr volontaire,
Et c'est pour toi seul que tu meurs.


LES DANAIDES

Toutes, portant l'amphore, une main sur la hanche,
Theano, Callidie, Amymone, Agave,
Esclaves d'un labeur sans cesse inacheve,
Courent du puits a l'urne ou l'eau vaine s'epanche.

Helas! le gres rugueux meurtrit l'epaule blanche,
Et le bras faible est las du fardeau souleve:
"Monstre, que nous avons nuit et jour abreuve,
O gouffre, que nous veut ta soif que rien n'etanche?"

Elles tombent, le vide epouvante leurs coeurs;
Mais la plus jeune alors, moins triste que ses soeurs,
Chante, et leur rend la force et la perseverance.

Tels sont l'oeuvre et le sort de nos illusions:
Elles tombent toujours, et la jeune Esperance
Leur dit toujours: "Mes soeurs, si nous recommencions!"


UN SONGE

Le laboureur m'a dit en songe: "Fais ton pain,
Je ne te nourris plus, gratte la terre et seme."
Le tisserand m'a dit: "Fais tes habits toi-meme."
Et le macon m'a dit: "Prends ta truelle en main."

Et seul, abandonne de tout le genre humain
Dont je trainais partout l'implacable anatheme,
Quand j'implorais du ciel une pitie supreme,
Je trouvais des lions debout dans mon chemin.

J'ouvris les yeux, doutant si l'aube etait reelle:
De hardis compagnons sifflaient sur leur echelle,
Les metiers bourdonnaient, les champs etaient semes.

Je connus mon bonheur et qu'au monde ou nous sommes
Nul ne peut se vanter de se passer des hommes;
Et depuis ce jour-la je les ai tous aimes.


LE RENDEZ-VOUS

Il est tard; l'astronome aux veilles obstinees,
Sur sa tour, dans le ciel ou meurt le dernier bruit,
Cherche des iles d'or, et, le front dans la nuit,
Regarde a l'infini blanchir des matinees;

Les mondes fuient pareils a des graines vannees;
L'epais fourmillement des nebuleuses luit;
Mais, attentif a l'astre echevele qu'il suit,
Il le somme, et lui dit: "Reviens dans mille annees."

Et l'astre reviendra. D'un pas ni d'un instant
Il ne saurait frauder la science eternelle;
Des hommes passeront, l'humanite l'attend;

D'un oeil changeant, mais sur, elle fait sentinelle;
Et, fut-elle abolie au temps de son retour,
Seule, la Verite veillerait sur la tour.


LA VOIE LACTEE

Aux etoiles j'ai dit un soir:
"Vous ne paraissez pas heureuses;
Vos lueurs, dans l'infini noir,
Ont des tendresses douloureuses;

"Et je crois voir au firmament
Un deuil blanc mene par des vierges
Qui portent d'innombrables cierges
Et se suivent languissamment.

"Etes-vous toujours en priere?
Etes-vous des astres blesses?
Car ce sont des pleurs de lumiere,
Non des rayons, que vous versez.

"Vous, les etoiles, les aieules
Des creatures et des dieux,
Vous avez des pleurs dans les yeux...."
Elles m'ont dit: "Nous sommes seules....

"Chacune de nous est tres loin
Des soeurs dont tu la crois voisine;
Sa clarte caressante et fine
Dans sa patrie est sans temoin;

"Et l'intime ardeur de ses flammes
Expire aux cieux indifferents."
Je leur ai dit: "Je vous comprends!
Car vous ressemblez a des ames:

"Ainsi que vous, chacune luit
Loin des soeurs qui semblent pres d'elle,
Et la solitaire immortelle
Brule en silence dans la nuit."


REPENTIR

J'aimais froidement ma patrie,
Au temps de la securite;
De son grand renom merite
J'etais fier sans idolatrie.

Je m'ecriais avec Schiller:
"Je suis un citoyen du monde;
En tous lieux ou la vie abonde,
Le sol m'est doux et l'homme cher!

"Des plages ou le jour se leve
Aux pays du soleil couchant,
Mon ennemi, c'est le mechant,
Mon drapeau, l'azur de mon reve!

"Ou regne en paix le droit vainqueur,
Ou l'art me sourit et m'appelle,
Ou la race est polie et belle,
Je naturalise mon coeur;

"Mon compatriote, c'est l'homme!"
Naguere ainsi je dispersais
Sur l'univers ce coeur francais:
J'en suis maintenant econome.

J'oubliais que j'ai tout recu,
Mon foyer et tout ce qui m'aime,
Mon pain, et mon ideal meme,
Du peuple dont je suis issu,

Et que j'ai goute des l'enfance,
Dans les yeux qui m'ont caresse,
Dans ceux memes qui m'ont blesse,
L'enchantement du ciel de France!

Je ne l'avais pas bien senti;
Mais depuis nos sombres journees,
De mes tendresses detournees
Je me suis enfin repenti;

Ces tendresses, je les ramene
Etroitement sur mon pays,
Sur les hommes que j'ai trahis
Par amour de l'espece humaine,

Sur tous ceux dont le sang coula
Pour mes droits et pour mes chimeres:
Si tous les hommes sont mes freres,
Que me sont desormais ceux-la?

Sur le pave des grandes routes,
Dans les ravins, sur les talus,
De ce sang, qu'on ne lavait plus,
Je baiserai les moindres gouttes;

Je ramasserai dans les tours
Et les fosses des citadelles
Les miettes noires, mais fideles,
Du pain sans ble des derniers jours;

Dans nos champs defonces encore,
Pelerin, je recueillerai,
Ainsi qu'un monument sacre,
Le moindre lambeau tricolore;

Car je t'aime dans tes malheurs,
O France, depuis cette guerre,
En enfant, comme le vulgaire
Qui sait mourir pour tes couleurs!

J'aime avec lui tes vieilles vignes,
Ton soleil, ton sol admire
D'ou nos ancetres ont tire
Leur force et leur genie insignes.

Quand j'ai de tes clochers tremblants
Vu les aigles noires voisines,
J'ai senti fremir les racines
De ma vie entiere en tes flancs,

Pris d'une pitie jalouse
Et navre d'un tardif remords,
J'assume ma part de tes torts;
Et ta misere, je l'epouse.


CE QUI DURE

Le present se fait vide et triste,
O mon amie, autour de nous;
Combien peu du passe subsiste!
Et ceux qui restent changent tous.

Nous ne voyons plus sans envie
Les yeux de vingt ans resplendir,
Et combien sont deja sans vie
Des yeux qui nous ont vu grandir!

Que de jeunesse emporte l'heure,
Qui n'en rapporte jamais rien!
Pourtant quelque chose demeure:
Je t'aime avec mon coeur ancien,

Mon vrai coeur, celui qui s'attache
Et souffre depuis qu'il est ne,
Mon coeur d'enfant, le coeur sans tache
Que ma mere m'avait donne;

Ce coeur ou plus rien ne penetre,
D'ou plus rien desormais ne sort;
Je t'aime avec ce que mon etre
A de plus fort contre la mort;

Et, s'il peut braver la mort meme,
Si le meilleur de l'homme est tel
Que rien n'en perisse, je t'aime
Avec ce que j'ai d'immortel.


LES INFIDELES

Je t'aime, en attendant mon eternelle epouse,
Celle qui doit venir a ma rencontre un jour,
Dans l'immuable Eden, loin de l'ingrat sejour
Ou les pres n'ont de fleurs qu'a peine un mois sur douze.

Je verrai devant moi, sur l'immense pelouse
Ou se cherchent les morts pour l'hymen sans retour,
Tes soeurs de tous les temps defiler tour a tour,
Et je te trahirai sans te rendre jalouse;

Car toi-meme, elisant ton epoux eternel,
Tu m'abandonneras des son premier appel,
Quand passera son ombre avec la foule humaine;

Et nous nous oublirons, comme les passagers
Que le meme navire a leurs foyers ramene,
Ne s'y souviennent plus de leurs liens legers.


LES AMOURS TERRESTRES

Nos yeux se sont croises et nous nous sommes plu.
Nee au siecle ou je vis et passant ou je passe,
Dans le double infini du temps et de l'espace
Tu ne me cherchais point, tu ne m'as point elu;

Moi, pour te joindre ici le jour qu'il a fallu,
Dans le monde eternel je n'avais point ta trace,
J'ignorais ta naissance et le lieu de ta race:
Le sort a donc tout fait, nous n'avons rien voulu.

Les terrestres amours ne sont qu'une aventure:
Ton epoux a venir et ma femme future
Soupirent vainement, et nous pleurons loin d'eux;

C'est lui que tu pressens en moi, qui lui ressemble,
Ce qui m'attire en toi, c'est elle, et tous les deux
Nous croyons nous aimer en les cherchant ensemble.


L'ALPHABET

Il git au fond de quelque armoire
Ce vieil alphabet tout jauni,
Ma premiere lecon d'histoire,
Mon premier pas vers l'infini.

Toute la Genese y figure;
Le lion, l'ours et l'elephant;
Du monde la grandeur obscure
Y troublait mon ame d'enfant.

Sur chaque bete un mot enorme
Et d'un sens toujours inconnu,
Posait l'enigme de sa forme
A mon desespoir ingenu.

Ah! dans ce lent apprentissage
La cause de mes pleurs, c'etait
La lettre noire, et non l'image
Ou la Nature me tentait.

Maintenant j'ai vu la Nature
Et ses splendeurs, j'en ai regret:
Je ressens toujours la torture
De la merveille et du secret,

Car il est un mot que j'ignore
Au beau front de ce sphinx ecrit,
J'en epelle la lettre encore
Et n'en saurai jamais l'esprit.


NOUS PROSPERONS

Nous prosperons! Qu'importe aux anciens malheureux,
Aux hommes nes trop tot, a qui le sort fut traitre,
Qui n'ont fait qu'aspirer, souffrir et disparaitre,
Dont meme les tombeaux aujourd'hui sonnent creux!

Helas! leurs descendants ne peuvent rien pour eux,
Car nous n'inventons rien qui les fasse renaitre.
Quand je songe a ces morts, le moderne bien-etre
Par leur injuste exil m'est rendu douloureux.

La tache humaine est longue et sa fin decevante:
Des generations la derniere vivante
Seule aura sans tourment tous ses greniers combles,

Et les premiers auteurs de la glebe feconde
N'auront pas vu courir sur la face du monde
Le sourire paisible et rassurant des bles.


LE COMPLICE

J'ai bon coeur, je ne veux a nul etre aucun mal,
Mais je retiens ma part des boeufs qu'un autre assomme
Et, malgre ma douceur, je suis bien aise en somme
Que le fouet d'un cocher hate un peu mon cheval.

Je suis juste, et je sens qu'un pauvre est mon egal,
Mais, pendant que je jette une obole a cet homme,
Je m'installe au banquet dont un pere econome
S'est donne les longs soins pour mon futur regal.

Je suis probe, mon bien ne doit rien a personne,
Mais j'usurpe le pain qui dans mes bles frissonne,
Heritier, sans labour, des champs fumes de morts.

Ainsi dans le massacre incessant qui m'engraisse,
Par la Nature elu, je fleuris et m'endors,
Comme l'enfant candide et sanglant d'une ogresse.




ALPHONSE DAUDET


AUX PETITS ENFANTS

Enfants d'un jour, o nouveau-nes,
Petites bouches, petits nez,
Petites levres demi-closes,
    Membres tremblants,
    Si frais, si blancs,
          Si roses;

Enfants d'un jour, o nouveau-nes,
Pour le bonheur que vous donnez
A vous voir dormir dans vos langes,
    Espoir des nids,
    Soyez benis,
          Chers anges!

Pour vos grands yeux effarouches
Que sous vos draps blancs vous cachez,
Pour vos sourires, vos pleurs meme,
    Tout ce qu'en vous,
    Etres si doux,
          On aime;

Pour tout ce que vous gazouillez,
Soyez benis, baises, choyes,
Gais rossignols, blanches fauvettes!
    Que d'amoureux
    Et que d'heureux
          Vous faites!

Lorsque sur vos chauds oreillers,
En souriant vous sommeillez,
Pres de vous, tout bas, o merveille!
    Une voix dit:
    "Dors, beau petit;
          Je veille."

C'est la voix de l'ange gardien;
Dormez, dormez, ne craignez rien;
Revez, sous ses ailes de neige:
    Le beau jaloux
    Vous berce et vous
          Protege.

Enfants d'un jour, o nouveau-nes,
Au paradis, d'ou vous venez,
Un leger fil d'or vous rattache.
    A ce fil d'or
    Tient l'ame encor
          Sans tache.

Vous etes a toute maison
Ce que la fleur est au gazon,
Ce qu'au ciel est l'etoile blanche,
    Ce qu'un peu d'eau

    Est au roseau
          Qui penche.

Mais vous avez de plus encor
Ce que n'a pas l'etoile d'or
Ce qui manque aux fleurs les plus belles.
    Malheur a nous!
    Vous avez tous
          Des ailes.


L'OISEAU BLEU

J'ai dans mon coeur un oiseau bleu,
Une charmante creature,
Si mignonne que sa ceinture
N'a pas l'epaisseur d'un cheveu.

Il lui faut du sang pour pature.
Bien longtemps, je me fis un jeu
De lui donner sa nourriture:
Les petits oiseaux mangent peu.

Mais, sans en rien laisser paraitre,
Dans mon coeur il a fait, le traitre,
Un trou large comme la main.

Et son bec fin comme une lame,
En continuant son chemin,
M'est entre jusqu'au fond de l'ame!....




HENRI CAZALIS


LA BETE

Qui donc t'a pu creer, Sphinx etrange, o Nature!
Et d'ou t'ont pu venir tes sanglants appetits?
C'est pour les devorer que tu fais tes petits,
Et c'est nous, tes enfants, qui sommes ta pature:
Que t'importent nos cris, nos larmes et nos fievres?
Impassible, tranquille, et ton beau front bruni
Par l'age, tu t'etends a travers l'infini,
Toujours du sang aux pieds et le sourire aux levres!


REMINISCENCES A DARWIN.

Je sens un monde en moi de confuses pensees,
Je sens obscurement que j'ai vecu toujours,
Que j'ai longtemps erre dans les forets passees,
Et que la bete encor garde en moi ses amours.

Je sens confusement, l'hiver, quand le soir tombe,
Que jadis, animal ou plante, j'ai souffert,
Lorsque Adonis saignant dormait pale en sa tombe;
Et mon coeur reverdit, quand tout redevient vert.

Certains jours, en errant dans les forets natales,
Je ressens dans ma chair les frissons d'autrefois,
Quand, la nuit grandissant les formes vegetales,
Sauvage, hallucine, je rampais sous les bois.

Dans le sol primitif nos racines sont prises;
Notre ame, comme un arbre, a grandi lentement;
Ma pensee est un temple aux antiques assises,
Ou l'ombre des Dieux morts vient errer par moment.

Quand mon esprit aspire a la pleine lumiere,
Je sens tout un passe qui me tient enchaine;
Je sens rouler en moi l'obscurite premiere:
La terre etait si sombre aux temps ou je suis ne!

Mon ame a trop dormi dans la nuit maternelle:
Pour monter vers le jour, qu'il m'a fallu d'efforts!
Je voudrais etre pur; la honte originelle,
Le vieux sang de la bete est reste dans mon corps.

Et je voudrais pourtant t'affranchir, o mon ame,
Des liens d'un passe qui ne veut pas mourir;
Je voudrais oublier mon origine infame,
Et les siecles sans fin que j'ai mis a grandir.

Mais c'est en vain: toujours en moi vivra ce monde
De reves, de pensers, de souvenirs confus,
Me rappelant ainsi ma naissance profonde,
Et l'ombre d'ou je sors, et le peu que je fus;

Et que j'ai transmigre dans des formes sans nombre,
Et que mon ame etait, sous tous ces corps divers,
La conscience, et l'ame aussi, splendide ou sombre,
Qui reve et se tourmente au fond de l'univers!




CHARLES FREMINE


RETOUR

Je viens de faire un grand voyage
Qui sur l'atlas n'est point trace:
Pays perdu! dont le mirage
Derriere moi s'est efface.

Le cap noir de la quarantaine
Met son ombre sur mon bateau
Couvert d'ecume et qui fait eau,
Mais dont je suis le capitaine.

Ai-je bien ou mal gouverne?
Encor n'ai-je point fait naufrage:
Sur maint bas-fond si j'ai donne,
J'ai vu de haut gronder l'orage.

Enfin, me voila de retour
Du beau pays de l'Esperance,
Si vaste, au moins en apparence,
Et dont si vite on fait le tour.

C'est fini ! Ma riche banniere
Et ma voilure sont a bas!
Plus de fleurs a ma boutonniere,
Et plus de femmes a mon bras;

Vieillir! C'est la grande defaite,
C'est la laideur et c'est l'affront,
C'est plus de rides a mon front
Et moins de cheveux a ma tete.

Oui, c'est la chose, et c'est mon tour.
O temps ou bouillonnaient les seves,
Ou mes seuls dieux, l'Art et l'Amour,
Traversaient l'orgueil de mes reves!

D'avoir suivi leur vol vainqueur,
Je n'ai rapporte, pour ma peine,
Qu'un tout petit brin de verveine
Avec un grand trou noir au coeur;

Et seul, au coin de la fenetre
Ou j'accoude mes longs ennuis,
Sachant ce que je pourrais etre,
Je pleure sur ce que je suis.




FRANCOIS COPPEE


JUIN

Dans cette vie ou nous ne sommes
Que pour un temps sitot fini,
L'instinct des oiseaux et des hommes
Sera toujours de faire un nid;

Et d'un peu de paille et d'argile
Tous veulent se construire, un jour,
Un humble toit, chaud et fragile,
Pour la famille et pour l'amour.

Par les yeux d'une fille d'Eve
Mon coeur profondement touche
Avait fait aussi ce doux reve
D'un bonheur etroit et cache.

Rempli de joie et de courage,
A fonder mon nid je songeais;
Mais un furieux vent d'orage
Vient d'emporter tous mes projets;

Et sur mon chemin solitaire
Je vois, triste et le front courbe,
Tous mes espoirs brises a terre
Comme les oeufs d'un nid tombe.


L'HOROSCOPE

Les deux soeurs etaient la, les bras entrelaces,
Debout devant la vieille aux regards fatidiques,
Qui tournait lentement de ses vieux doigts lasses
Sur un coin de haillon les cartes prophetiques.

Brune et blonde, et de plus fraiches comme un matin,
L'une sombre pavot, l'autre blanche anemone,
Celle-ci fleur de mai, celle-la fleur d'automne,
Ensemble elles voulaient connaitre le destin.

"La vie, helas! sera pour toi bien douloureuse,"
Dit la vieille a la brune au sombre et fier profil.
Celle-ci demanda: "Du moins m'aimera-t-il?
--Oui.--Vous me trompiez donc. Je serai trop heureuse."

"Tu n'auras meme pas l'amour d'un autre coeur,"
Dit la vieille a l'enfant blanche comme la neige.
Celle-ci demanda: "Moi, du moins, l'aimerai-je?
--Oui.--Que me disiez-vous? J'aurai trop de bonheur."


L'ATTENTE

Au bout du vieux canal plein de mats, juste en face
De l'Ocean et dans la derniere maison,
Assise a sa fenetre, et quelque temps qu'il fasse,
Elle se tient, les yeux fixes sur l'horizon.

Bien qu'elle ait la paleur des eternels veuvages,
Sa robe est claire; et, bien que les soucis pesants
Aient sur ses traits fletris exerce leurs ravages,
Ses vetements sont ceux des filles de seize ans.

Car depuis bien des jours, patiente vigie,
Des l'instant ou la mer bleuit dans le matin
Jusqu'a ce qu'elle soit par le couchant rougie,
Elle est assise la, regardant au lointain.

Chaque aurore elle voit une tardive etoile
S'eteindre, et chaque soir le soleil s'enfoncer
A cette place ou doit reparaitre la voile
Qu'elle vit la, jadis, palir et s'effacer.

Son coeur de fiancee, immuable et fidele,
Attend toujours, certain de l'espoir partage,
Loyal; et rien en elle, aussi bien qu'autour d'elle,
Depuis dix ans qu'il est parti, rien n'a change.

Les quelques doux vieillards qui lui rendent visite,
En la voyant avec ses bandeaux reguliers,
Son ruban mince ou pend sa medaille benite,
Son corsage a la vierge et ses petits souliers,

La croiraient une enfant ingenue et qui boude,
Si parfois ses doigts purs, ivoirins et tremblante,
Alors que sur sa main fievreuse elle s'accoude
Ne livraient le secret des premiers cheveux blancs.

Partout le souvenir de l'absent se rencontre
En mille objets fanes et deja presque anciens:
Cette lunette en cuivre est a lui, cette montre
Est la sienne, et ces vieux instruments sont les siens.

Il a laisse, de peur d'encombrer sa cabine,
Ces gros livres poudreux dans leur oubli profond,
Et c'est lui qui tua d'un coup de carabine
Le monstrueux lezard qui s'etale au plafond.

Ces mille riens, decor naif de la muraille,
Naguere il les a tous apportes de tres loin.
Seule, comme un temoin inclement et qui raille,
Une carte navale est pendue en un coin;

Sur le tableau jaunatre, entre ses noires tringles,
Les vents et les courants se croisent a l'envi;
Et la succession des petites epingles
N'a pas marque longtemps le voyage suivi.

Elle conduit jusqu'a la ligne tropicale
Le navire vainqueur du flux et du reflux,
Puis cesse brusquement a la derniere escale,
Celle d'ou le marin, helas! n'ecrivit plus.

Et ce point justement ou sa trace s'arrete
Est celui qu'un burin savant fit le plus noir:
C'est l'obscur rendez-vous des flots, ou la tempete
Creuse un inexorable et profond entonnoir.

Mais elle ne voit pas le tableau redoutable
Et feuillette, l'esprit ailleurs, du bout des doigts,
Les planches d'un herbier eparses sur la table,
Fleurs pales qu'il cueillit aux Indes autrefois.

Jusqu'au soir sa pensee extatique et sereine
Songe au chemin qu'il fait en mer pour revenir,
Ou parfois, evoquant des jours meilleurs, egrene
Le chapelet mystique et doux du souvenir;

Et, quand sur l'Ocean la nuit met son mystere,
Calme et fermant les yeux, elle reve du chant
Des matelots joyeux d'apercevoir la terre,
Et d'un navire d'or dans le soleil couchant.


CHANSON D'EXIL

Triste exile, qu'il te souvienne
Combien l'avenir etait beau,
Quand sa main tremblait dans la tienne
        Comme un oiseau,

Et combien ton ame etait pleine
D'une bonne et douce chaleur,
Quand tu respirais son haleine
        Comme une fleur!

Mais elle est loin, la chere idole,
Et tout s'assombrit de nouveau;
Tu sais qu'un souvenir s'envole
        Comme un oiseau;

Deja l'aile du doute plane
Sur ton ame ou nait la douleur;
Et tu sais qu'un amour se fane
        Comme une fleur.


ROMANCE

Quand vous me montrez une rose
Qui s'epanouit sous l'azur,
Pourquoi suis-je alors plus morose?
Quand vous me montrez une rose,
C'est que je pense a son front pur.

Quand vous me montrez une etoile,
Pourquoi les pleurs, comme un brouillard,
Sur mes yeux jettent-ils leur voile?
Quand vous me montrez une etoile,
C'est que je pense a son regard.

Quand vous me montrez l'hirondelle
Qui part jusqu'au prochain avril,
Pourquoi mon ame se meurt-elle?
Quand vous me montrez l'hirondelle,
C'est que je pense a mon exil.


LIED

Rougissante et tete baissee,
Je la vois me sourire encor.
--Pour le doigt de ma fiancee
Qu'on me fasse un bel anneau d'or!

Elle part, mais bonne et fidele;
Je vais l'attendre en m'affligeant.
--Pour garder ce qui me vient d'elle,
Qu'on me fasse un coffret d'argent!

J'ai sur le coeur un poids enorme;
L'exil est trop dur et trop long.
--Pour que je me repose et dorme,
Qu'on me fasse un cercueil de plomb!


ETOILES FILANTES

Dans les nuits d'automne, errant par la ville,
Je regarde au ciel avec mon desir,
Car si, dans le temps qu'une etoile file,
On forme un souhait, il doit s'accomplir.

Enfant, mes souhaits sont toujours les memes:
Quand un astre tombe, alors, plein d'emoi,
Je fais de grands voeux afin que tu m'aimes
Et qu'en ton exil tu penses a moi.

A cette chimere, helas! je veux croire,
N'ayant que cela pour me consoler.
Mais voici l'hiver, la nuit devient noire,
Et je ne vois plus d'etoiles filer.


A UN ELEGIAQUE

Jeune homme, qui me viens lire tes plaintes vaines,
Garde-toi bien d'un mal dont je me suis gueri.
Jadis j'ai, comme toi, du plus pur de mes veines
Tire des pleurs de sang, et le monde en a ri.

Du courage! La plainte est ridicule et lache.
Comme l'enfant de Sparte ayant sous ses habits
Un renard furieux qui le mord sans relache,
Ne laisse plus rien voir de tes tourments subis.

On fut cruel pour toi. Sois indulgent et juste.
Rends le bien pour le mal, c'est le vrai talion,
Mais, t'etant bien barde le coeur d'orgueil robuste,
Va! calme comme un sage et seul comme un lion.

Quand meme, dans ton sein, les chagrins, noirs reptiles,
Se tordraient, cache bien au public desoeuvre
Que tu gardes en toi des tresors inutiles
Comme des lingots d'or sur un vaisseau sombre.

Sois impassible ainsi qu'un soldat sous les armes;
Et lorsque la douleur dressera tes cheveux
Et qu'aux yeux, malgre toi, te monteront des larmes,
N'en conviens pas, enfant, et dis que c'est nerveux!




JOSE-MARIA DE HEREDIA


ANTOINE ET CLEOPATRE

I.--LE CYDNUS.

Sous l'azur triomphal, au soleil qui flamboie,
La trireme d'argent blanchit le fleuve noir,
Et son sillage y laisse un parfum d'encensoir
Avec des chants de flute et des frissons de soie.

A la proue eclatante ou l'epervier s'eploie,
Hors de son dais royal se penchant pour mieux voir,
Cleopatre, debout dans la splendeur du soir,
Semble un grand oiseau d'or qui guette au loin sa proie.

Voici Tarse ou l'attend le guerrier desarme;
Et la brune Lagide ouvre dans l'air charme
Ses bras d'ambre ou la pourpre a mis des reflets roses;

Et ses yeux n'ont pas vu, presages de son sort,
Aupres d'elle, effeuillant sur l'eau sombre des roses,
Les deux Enfants divins, le Desir et la Mort.

II--SOIR DE BATAILLE.

Le choc avait ete tres rude. Les tribuns
Et les centurions, ralliant les cohortes,
Humaient encor, dans l'air ou vibraient leurs voix fortes,
La chaleur du carnage et ses acres parfums.

D'un oeil morne, comptant leurs compagnons defunts,
Les soldats regardaient, comme des feuilles mortes,
Tourbillonner au loin les archers de Phraortes;
Et la sueur coulait de leurs visages bruns.

C'est alors qu'apparut, tout herisse de fleches,
Rouge du flux vermeil de ses blessures fraiches,
Sous la pourpre flottante et l'airain rutilant,

Au fracas des buccins qui sonnaient leur fanfare,
Superbe, maitrisant son cheval qui s'effare,
Sur le ciel enflamme, l'Imperator sanglant!

III.--ANTOINE ET CLEOPATRE.

Tous deux, ils regardaient, de la haute terrasse,
L'Egypte s'endormir sous un ciel etouffant
Et le Fleuve, a travers le Delta noir qu'il fend,
Vers Bubaste ou Sais rouler son onde grasse.

Et le Romain sentait sous la lourde cuirasse,
Soldat captif bercant le sommeil d'un enfant,
Ployer et defaillir sur son coeur triomphant
Le corps voluptueux que son etreinte embrasse.

Tournant sa tete pale entre ses cheveux bruns,
Vers celui qu'enivraient d'invincibles parfums,
Elle tendit sa bouche et ses prunelles claires.

Et, sur elle courbe, l'ardent Imperator
Vit dans ses larges yeux etoiles de points d'or
Toute une mer immense ou fuyaient des galeres.


LES CONQUERANTS
Comme un vol de gerfauts hors du charnier natal,
Fatigues de porter leurs miseres hautaines,
De Palos de Moguer, routiers et capitaines
Partaient, ivres d'un reve heroique et brutal.

Ils allaient conquerir le fabuleux metal
Que Cipango murit dans ses mines lointaines,
Et les vents alizes inclinaient leurs antennes
Aux bords mysterieux du monde occidental.

Chaque soir, esperant des lendemains epiques,
L'azur phosphorescent de la mer des Tropiques
Enchantait leur sommeil d'un mirage dore;

Ou, penches a l'avant des blanches caravelles,
Ils regardaient monter en un ciel ignore
Du fond de l'Ocean des etoiles nouvelles.

COLLOQUE SENTIMENTAL

Dans le vieux parc solitaire et glace,
Deux formes ont tout a l'heure passe.

Leurs yeux sont morts et leurs levres sont molles,
Et l'on entend a peine leurs paroles.

Dans le vieux parc solitaire et glace,
Deux spectres ont evoque le passe.

--Te souvient-il de notre extase ancienne?
--Pourquoi voulez-vous donc qu'il m'en souvienne?

--Ton coeur bat-il toujours a mon seul nom?
Toujours vois-tu mon ame en reve?--Non.

--Ah! les beaux jours de bonheur indicible
Ou nous joignions nos bouches!--C'est possible.


--Qu'il etait bleu, le ciel, et grand l'espoir!
--L'espoir a fui, vaincu, vers le ciel noir.

Tels ils marchaient dans les avoines folles,
Et la nuit seule entendit leurs paroles.


LA BONNE CHANSON

Puisque l'aube grandit, puisque voici l'aurore,
Puisque, apres m'avoir fui longtemps, l'espoir veut bien
Revoler devers moi qui l'appelle et l'implore,
Puisque tout ce bonheur veut bien etre le mien,

C'en est fait a present des funestes pensees,
C'en est fait des mauvais reves, ah! c'en est fait
Surtout de l'ironie et des levres pincees
Et des mots ou l'esprit sans l'ame triomphait.

Arriere aussi les poings crispes et la colere
A propos des mechants et des sots rencontres;
Arriere la rancune abominable! arriere
L'oubli qu'on cherche en des breuvages execres!

Car je veux, maintenant qu'un Etre de lumiere
A dans ma nuit profonde emis cette clarte
D'une amour a la fois immortelle et premiere,
De par la grace, le sourire et la bonte,

Je veux, guide par vous, beaux yeux aux flammes douces,
Par toi conduit, o main ou tremblera ma main,
Marcher droit, que ce soit par des sentiers de mousses
Ou que rocs et cailloux encombrent le chemin;

Oui, je veux marcher droit et calme dans la Vie,
Vers le but ou le sort dirigera mes pas,
Sans violence, sans remords et sans envie:
Ce sera le devoir heureux aux gais combats.

Et comme, pour bercer les lenteurs de la route,
Je chanterai des airs ingenus, je me dis
Qu'elle m'ecoutera sans deplaisir sans doute;
Et vraiment je ne veux pas d'autre Paradis.

La lune blanche
Luit dans les bois;
De chaque branche
Part une voix
Sous la ramee....
O bien-aimee.

L'etang reflete,
Profond miroir,
La silhouette
Du saule noir
Ou le vent pleure....
Revons, c'est l'heure.

Un vaste et tendre
Apaisement
Semble descendre
Du firmament
Que l'astre irise....
C'est l'heure exquise.


ROMANCES SANS PAROLES

Il pleure dans mon coeur
Comme il pleut sur la ville,
Quelle est cette langueur
Qui penetre mon coeur?

O bruit doux de la pluie
Par terre et sur les toits!
Pour un coeur qui s'ennuie
O le chant de la pluie!

Il pleure sans raison
Dans ce coeur qui s'ecoeure.
Quoi! nulle trahison?
Ce deuil est sans raison.

C'est bien la pire peine
De ne savoir pourquoi,
Sans amour et sans haine,
Mon coeur a tant de peine.

Il faut, voyez-vous, nous pardonner les choses.
De cette facon nous serons bien heureuses,
Et si notre vie a des instants moroses,
Du moins nous serons, n'est-ce pas? deux pleureuses.

O que nous melions, ames soeurs que nous sommes,
A nos voeux confus la douceur puerile
De cheminer loin des femmes et des hommes,
Dans le frais oubli de ce qui nous exile.

Soyons deux enfants, soyons deux jeunes filles
Eprises de rien et de tout etonnees,
Qui s'en vont palir sous les chastes charmilles
Sans meme savoir qu'elles sont pardonnees.

Dans l'interminable
Ennui de la plaine,
La neige incertaine
Luit comme du sable.

Le ciel est de cuivre,
Sans lueur aucune.
On croirait voir vivre
Et mourir la lune.

Comme des nuees
Flottent gris les chenes
Des forets prochaines
Parmi les buees.

Le ciel est de cuivre,
Sans lueur aucune.
On croirait voir vivre
Et mourir la lune.

Corneille poussive
Et vous, les loups maigres,
Par ces bises aigres
Quoi donc vous arrive?

Dans l'interminable
Ennui de la plaine,

La neige incertaine
Luit comme du sable.


SAGESSE

            Ecoutez la chanson bien douce
            Qui ne pleure que pour vous plaire.
            Elle est discrete, elle est legere:
            Un frisson d'eau sur de la mousse!

            La voix vous fut connue (et chere?)
            Mais a present elle est voilee
            Comme une veuve desolee,
            Pourtant comme elle encore fiere,

            Et dans les longs plis de son voile
            Qui palpite aux brises d'automne
            Cache et montre au coeur qui s'etonne
            La verite comme une etoile.

            Elle dit, la voix reconnue,
            Que la bonte c'est notre vie,
            Que de la haine et de l'envie
            Rien ne reste, la mort venue.

            Elle parle aussi de la gloire
            D'etre simple sans plus attendre,
            Et de noces d'or et du tendre
            Bonheur d'une paix sans victoire.

            Accueillez la voix qui persiste
            Dans son naif epithalame.
            Allez, rien n'est meilleur a l'ame
            Que de faire une ame moins triste!

            Elle est "en peine" et "de passage,"
            L'ame qui souffre sans colere,
            Et comme sa morale est claire!
            Ecoutez la chanson bien sage.

               Un grand sommeil noir
               Tombe sur ma vie:
               Dormez, tout espoir,
               Dormez, toute envie!

               Je ne vois plus rien,
               Je perds la memoire
               Du mal et du bien....
               O la triste histoire!

               Je suis un berceau
               Qu'une main balance
               Au creux d'un caveau:
               Silence, silence!

           Le ciel est, par-dessus le toit,
               Si bleu, si calme!
           Un arbre, par-dessus le toit,
               Berce sa palme.

           La cloche, dans le ciel qu'on voit,
               Doucement tinte.
           Un oiseau sur l'arbre qu'on voit
               Chante sa plainte.

           Mon Dieu, mon Dieu, la vie est la,
               Simple et tranquille.
           Cette paisible rumeur-la
               Vient de la ville.

           --Qu'as-tu fait, o toi que voila
               Pleurant sans cesse,
           Dis, qu'as-tu fait, toi que voila,
               De ta jeunesse?

               Je ne sais pourquoi
               Mon esprit amer
D'une aile inquiete et folle vole sur la mer.
               Tout ce qui m'est cher,
               D'une aile d'effroi
Mon amour le couve au ras des flots. Pourquoi, pourquoi?

            Mouette a l'essor melancolique,
            Elle suit la vague, ma pensee,
            A tous les vents du ciel balancee
            Et biaisant quand la maree oblique,
            Mouette a l'essor melancolique,

               Ivre de soleil
               Et de liberte,
Un instinct la guide a travers cette immensite.
               La brise d'ete
               Sur le flot vermeil
Doucement la porte en un tiede demi-sommeil.

            Parfois si tristement elle crie
            Qu'elle alarme au lointain le pilote,
            Puis au gre du vent se livre et flotte
            Et plonge, et l'aile toute meurtrie
            Revole, et puis si tristement crie!

               Je ne sais pourquoi
               Mon esprit amer
D'une aile inquiete et folle vole sur la mer.
               Tout ce qui m'est cher,
               D'une aile d'effroi,
Mon amour le couve au ras des flots. Pourquoi, pourquoi?

Vous voila, vous voila, pauvres bonnes pensees!
L'espoir qu'il faut, regret des graces depensees,
Douceur de coeur avec severite d'esprit,
Et cette vigilance, et le calme prescrit,
Et toutes!--Mais encor lentes, bien eveillees,
Bien d'aplomb, mais encor timides, debrouillees
A peine du lourd reve et de la tiede nuit.
C'est a qui de vous va plus gauche, l'une suit
L'autre, et toutes ont peur du vaste clair de lune.

"Telles, quand des brebis sortent d'un clos. C'est une,
Puis deux, puis trois. Le reste est la, les yeux baisses,
La tete a terre, et l'air des plus embarrasses,
Faisant ce que fait leur chef de file: il s'arrete,
Elles s'arretent tour a tour, posant leur tete
Sur son dos simplement et sans savoir pourquoi."
Votre pasteur, o mes brebis, ce n'est pas moi,
C'est un meilleur, un bien meilleur, qui sait les causes,
Lui qui vous tint longtemps et si longtemps la closes
Mais qui vous delivra de sa main au temps vrai.
Suivez-le. Sa houlette est bonne.
                                  Et je serai,
Sous sa voix toujours douce a votre ennui qui bele,
Je serai, moi, par vos chemins, son chien fidele.


ART POETIQUE

De la musique avant toute chose,
Et pour cela prefere l'Impair
Plus vague et plus soluble dans l'air,
Sans rien en lui qui pese ou qui pose.

Il faut aussi que tu n'ailles point
Choisir tes mots sans quelque meprise:
Rien de plus cher que la chanson grise
Ou l'Indecis au Precis se joint.

C'est des beaux yeux derriere des voiles,
C'est le grand jour tremblant de midi,
C'est par un ciel d'automne attiedi,
Le bleu fouillis des claires etoiles!

Car nous voulons la Nuance encor,
Pas la Couleur, rien que la nuance!
Oh! la nuance seule fiance
Le reve au reve et la flute au cor!

Fuis du plus loin la Pointe assassine,
L'Esprit cruel et le Rire impur,
Qui font pleurer les yeux de l'Azur,
Et tout cet ail de basse cuisine!

Prends l'eloquence et tords-lui son cou!
Tu feras bien, en train d'energie,
De rendre un peu la Rime assagie,
Si l'on n'y veille, elle ira jusqu'ou?

Oh! qui dira les torts de la Rime?
Quel enfant sourd ou quel negre fou
Nous a forge ce bijou d'un sou
Qui sonne creux et faux sous la lime?

De la musique encore et toujours!
Que ton vers soit la chose envolee
Qu'on sent qui fuit d'une ame en allee
Vers d'autres cieux a d'autres amours.

Que ton vers soit la bonne aventure
Eparse au vent crispe du matin
Qui va fleurant la menthe et le thym....
Et tout le reste est litterature.


UN VEUF PARLE

Je vois un groupe sur la mer.
Quelle mer? Celle de mes larmes.
Mes yeux mouilles du vent amer
Dans cette nuit d'ombre et d'alarmes
Sont deux etoiles sur la mer.

C'est une toute jeune femme
Et son enfant deja tout grand
Dans une barque ou nul ne rame,
Sans mat ni voile, en plein courant,
Un jeune garcon, une femme!

En plein courant dans l'ouragan!
L'enfant se cramponne a sa mere
Qui ne sait plus ou, non plus qu'en....
Ni plus rien, et qui, folle, espere
En le courant, en l'ouragan.

Esperez en Dieu, pauvre folle,
Crois en notre Pere, petit.
La tempete qui vous desole,
Mon coeur de la-haut vous predit
Qu'elle va cesser, petit, folle!

Et paix au groupe sur la mer,
Sur cette mer de bonnes larmes!
Mes yeux joyeux dans le ciel clair,
Par cette nuit sans plus d'alarmes,
Sont deux bons anges sur la mer.


PARABOLES

Soyez beni, Seigneur, qui m'avez fait chretien
Dans ces temps de feroce ignorance et de haine;
Mais donnez-moi la force et l'audace sereine
De vous etre a toujours fidele comme un chien.

De vous etre l'agneau destine qui suit bien
Sa mere et ne sait faire au patre aucune peine,
Sentant qu'il doit sa vie encore, apres sa laine,
Au maitre, quand il veut utiliser ce bien,

Le poisson, pour servir au Fils de monogramme,
L'anon obscur qu'un jour en triomphe il monta,
Et, dans ma chair, les porcs qu'a l'abime il jeta.

Car l'animal, meilleur que l'homme et que la femme,
En ces temps de revolte et de duplicite,
Fait son humble devoir avec simplicite.




EMILE BERGERAT


PAROLES DOREES

J'ai repose mon coeur avec tranquillite
Dans l'asile tres sur d'un amour tres honnete.
La lutte que je livre au sort est simple et nette,
Et tout peut m'y trahir, non la virilite.

Je ne crois pas a ceux qui pleurent, l'ame eprise
De la sonorite de leurs propres sanglots;
Leur ideal est ne de l'ecume des mots,
Et comme je les tiens pour nuls, je les meprise.

Cerveaux que la fumee enivre et qu'elle enduit,
Ils auraient invente la douleur pour se plaindre;
Leur sterile genie est pareil au cylindre
Qui tourne a vide, grince et s'use dans la nuit.

Ils souffrent? Croient-ils donc porter dans leur besace
Le deluge final de tous les maux predits?
Sous notre ciel charge d'orages, je le dis,
Il n'est plus de douleur que la douleur d'Alsace.

J'aime les forts, les sains et les gais. Je pretends
Que la vie est docile et souffre qu'on la mene:
J'observe dans la mort un calme phenomene
Accessible a mes sens libres et consentants,

Et qui ne trouble pas ma paix interieure.
Car la forme renait plus jeune du tombeau,
Et l'ombre passagere ou s'engloutit le Beau
Couve une eternite dans l'eclipse d'une heure.

Car la couleur charmante et mere des parfums
Rayonne inextinguible au fond des nuits funebres,
Et sa splendeur de feu qu'exaltent les tenebres
Emparadise encor les univers defunts.

Femme, recorde-moi ceci. Ma force vierge
Est eclose aux ardeurs brunes de tes beaux yeux:
Quand mon coeur sera mur pour le sol des aieux,
Notre amour sera clos. N'allume pas de cierge.

Le ciel restera sourd comme il reste beant.
O femme, ecoute-moi, pas de terreur vulgaire!
Si l'ame est immortelle, il ne m'importe guere,
Et je ne me vends pas aux chances du neant.

Aucun joug n'a ploye ma nuque inasservie,
Et dans la liberte que lui fait sa vertu,
Voici l'homme qui s'est lui-meme revetu
Du pouvoir de juger et d'attester sa vie.

Hors de moi, je ne prends ni reve ni conseil;
N'arrachant du labeur que l'oeuvre et non la tache,
Je ne me promets point de recompense lache
Pour le plaisir que j'ai de combattre au soleil.

Le limon, que son oeuvre auguste divinise
Par son epouvantable enfantement, repond
Aux desirs surhumains de mon etre fecond,
Et ma chair douloureuse avec lui fraternise.

Telle est ma loi. Sans peur et sans espoir, je vais,
Apres m'etre creuse ma route comme Alcide.
Que la combinaison de mon astre decide
Si je suis l'homme bon ou bien l'homme mauvais.

Mais, quel que soit le mot qu'ajoute ma planete
Aux constellations de la fatalite,
J'ai repose mon coeur avec tranquillite
Dans l'asile tres sur d'un amour tres honnete.




FRANCOIS FABIE.


LES GENETS

Les genets, doucement balances par la brise,
Sur les vastes plateaux font une houle d'or;
Et, tandis que le patre a leur ombre s'endort,
Son troupeau va broutant cette fleur qui le grise;

Cette fleur qui le fait beler d'amour, le soir,
Quand il roule des hauts des monts vers les etables,
Et qu'il croise en chemin les grands boeufs venerables
Dont les doux beuglements appellent l'abreuvoir;

Cette fleur toute d'or, de lumiere et de soie,
En papillons posee au bout des brins menus,
Et dont les lourds parfums semblent etre venus
De la plage lointaine ou le soleil se noie....

Certes, j'aime les pres ou chantent les grillons,
Et la vigne pendue aux flancs de la colline,
Et les champs de bleuets sur qui le ble s'incline,
Comme sur des yeux bleus tombent des cheveux blonds.

Mais je prefere aux pres fleuris, aux grasses plaines,
Aux coteaux ou la vigne etend ses pampres verts,
Les sauvages sommets, de genets recouverts,
Qui font au vent d'ete de si fauves haleines.

Vous en souvenez-vous, genets de mon pays,
Des petits ecoliers aux cheveux en broussailles
Qui s'enfoncaient sous vos rameaux comme des cailles,
Troublant dans leur sommeil les lapins ebahis?

Comme l'herbe etait fraiche a l'abri de vos tiges!
Comme on s'y trouvait bien, sur le dos allonge,
Dans le thym qui faisait, aux sauges melange,
Un parfum enivrant a donner des vertiges!

Et quelle emotion lorsqu'un leger frou-frou
Annoncait la fauvette apportant la pature,
Et qu'en bien l'epiant on trouvait d'aventure
Son nid plein d'oiseaux nus et qui tendaient le cou!

Quel bonheur, quand le givre avait garni de perles
Vos fins rameaux emus qui sifflaient dans le vent,
--Precoces braconniers,--de revenir souvent,
Tendre en vos corridors des lacets pour les merles!

Mais il fallait quitter les genets et les monts,
S'en aller au college etudier des livres,
Et sentir, loin de l'air natal qui vous rend ivres,
S'engourdir ses jarrets et siffler ses poumons;

Passer de longs hivers, dans des salles bien closes,
A regarder la neige a travers les carreaux,
Eternuant dans des auteurs petits et gros,
Et soupirant apres les oiseaux et les roses;

Et, l'ete, se haussant sur son banc d'ecolier,
Comme un forcat qui, tout en ramant, tend sa chaine,
Pour sentir si le vent de la lande prochaine
Ne vous apporte pas le parfum familier....

Enfin, la grille s'ouvre! On retourne au village;
Ainsi que les genets, notre ame est tout en fleurs,
Et dans les houx remplis de vieux merles siffleurs
On sent un air plus pur qui vous souffle au visage.

On retrouve l'enfant blonde avec qui cent fois
On a jadis couru la foret et la lande;
Elle n'a point change,--sinon, qu'elle est plus grande,
Que ses yeux sont plus doux et plus douce sa voix.

--"Revenons aux genets!--Je le veux bien!" dit-elle.
Et l'on va, cote a cote, en causant, tout troubles
Par le souffle inconnu qui passe sur les bles,
Par le chant d'une source, ou par le bruit d'une aile.

Les genets ont grandi, mais pourtant moins que nous:
Il faut nous bien baisser pour passer sous leurs branches,
Encore accroche-t-elle un peu ses coiffes blanches;
Quant a moi, je me mets simplement a genoux.

Et nous parlons des temps lointains, des courses folles,
Des nids ravis ensemble, et de ces riens charmants
Qui paraissent toujours sublimes aux amants,
Parce que leurs regards soulignent leurs paroles.

Puis, le silence; puis, la rougeur des aveux,
Et le sein qui palpite, et la main qui tressaille,
Et le bras amoureux qui fait ployer la taille...
Comme le serpolet sent bon dans les cheveux!

Et les fleurs des genets nous font un diademe;
Et, par l'ecartement des branches,--haut dans l'air,--
Parait comme un point noir l'alouette au chant clair
Qui, de l'azur, benit le coin d'ombre ou l'on aime!

Ah! de ces jours lointains,--si lointains et si doux!--
De ces jours dont un seul vaut une vie entiere,
--Et de la blonde enfant qui dort au cimetiere,
Genets de mon pays, vous en souvenez-vous?

LE BON GITE

Bonne vieille, que fais-tu la?
Il fait assez chaud sans cela;
Tu peux laisser tomber la flamme.
Menage ton bois, pauvre femme,
Je suis seche, je n'ai plus froid.

Mais elle, qui ne veut m'entendre,
Jette un fagot, range la cendre:

"Chauffe-toi, soldat, chauffe-toi!"

Bonne vieille, je n'ai pas faim.
Garde ton jambon et ton vin;
J'ai mange la soupe a l'etape.
Veux-tu bien m'oter cette nappe!
C'est trop bon et trop beau pour moi.

Mais elle, qui n'en veut rien faire,
Taille mon pain, remplit mon verre:

"Refais-toi, soldat, refais-toi!"

Bonne vieille, pour qui ces draps?
Par ma foi, tu n'y penses pas!
Et ton etable? Et cette paille
Ou l'on fait son lit a sa taille?
Je dormirai la comme un roi.

Mais elle qui n'en veut demordre,
Place les draps, met tout en ordre:

"Couche-toi, soldat, couche-toi!"

--Le jour vient, le depart aussi.--
Allons! adieu... Mais qu'est ceci?
Mon sac est plus lourd que la veille....
Ah! bonne hotesse, ah! chere vieille,
Pourquoi tant me gater, pourquoi?

Et la bonne vieille de dire,
Moitie larme, moitie sourire:

"J'ai mon gars soldat comme toi!"




GEORGES BOUTELLEAU


LE COLIBRI

J'ai vu passer aux pays froids
L'oiseau des iles merveilleuses,
Il allait frolant les yeuses
Et les sapins mornes des bois.

Je lui dis: "Tes plages sont belles,
Ne pleures-tu pas leur soleil?"
Il repondit: "Tout m'est vermeil:
Je porte mon ciel sur mes ailes!"


LES DEUX OMBRES

Deux ombres cheminaient dans une etroite allee,
Sous le pale couchant d'un jour mourant d'ete:
L'une avait sur la levre un sourire enchante;
L'autre etait languissante et de crepes voilee.

Elles allaient sans but, distraites du chemin,
Cherchant la solitude et son divin mystere;
Fiances eternels aussi vieux que la terre:
La Douleur et l'Amour qui se donnaient la main.




LOUIS TIERCELIN


LE PETIT ENFANT

Il jouait, le petit enfant
Aux blanches mains, aux levres roses;
Ignorant nos soucis moroses,
Il jouait, le petit enfant.
Joyeux, candide et triomphant,
Sur le tapis couvert de roses,
Il jouait, le petit enfant
Aux blanches mains, aux levres roses.

Il dormait, le petit enfant,
Dans son berceau de mousseline.
Fleur fatiguee et qui s'incline,
Il dormait, le petit enfant.
Et la mere, en le rechauffant,
Le bercait d'une voix caline,
Il dormait, le petit enfant,
Dans son berceau de mousseline.

Il vivait, le petit enfant,
Heureux et rose a faire envie,
Front radieux, ame ravie,
Il vivait, le petit enfant.
Le pere faisait pour sa vie
De beaux reves que Dieu defend.
Il vivait, le petit enfant,
Heureux et rose a faire envie.

Il est mort, le petit enfant;
Il s'est envole vers les Anges.
Avec des sourires etranges,
Il est mort, le petit enfant.
Il est mort, et le coeur se fend
Devant ce linceul fait de langes.
Il est mort, le petit enfant;
Il s'est envole vers les Anges.




GUY DE MAUPASSANT


DECOUVERTE

J'etais enfant. J'aimais les grands combats,
Les chevaliers et leur pesante armure,
Et tous les preux qui tomberent la-bas
Pour racheter la Sainte Sepulture.

L'Anglais Richard faisait battre mon coeur;
Et je l'aimais, quand apres ses conquetes
Il revenait, et que son bras vainqueur
Avait coupe tout un collier de tetes.

D'une Beaute je prenais les couleurs.
Une baguette etait mon cimeterre;
Puis je partais a la guerre des fleurs
Et des bourgeons dont je jonchais la terre.

Je possedais au vent libre des cieux
Un banc de mousse ou s'elevait mon trone.
Je meprisais les rois ambitieux,
De rameaux verts j'avais fait ma couronne.

J'etais heureux et ravi. Mais un jour
Je vis venir une jeune compagne.
J'offris mon coeur, mon royaume et ma cour,
Et les chateaux que j'avais en Espagne.

Elle s'assit sous les marronniers verts;
Or, je crus voir, tant je la trouvais belle,
Dans ses yeux bleus comme un autre univers,
Et je restai tout songeur aupres d'elle.

Pourquoi laisser mon reve et ma gaite
En regardant cette fillette blonde?
Pourquoi Colomb fut-il si tourmente
Quand, dans la brume, il entrevit un monde?


L'OISELEUR

L'Oiseleur Amour se promene
Lorsque les coteaux sont fleuris,
Fouillant les buissons et la plaine,
Et, chaque soir, sa cage est pleine
Des petits oiseaux qu'il a pris.

Aussitot que la nuit s'efface
Il vient, tend avec soin son fil,
Jette la glu de place en place,
Puis seme, pour cacher la trace,
Quelques grains d'avoine ou de mil.

Il s'embusque au coin d'une haie,
Se couche aux berges des ruisseaux,
Glisse en rampant sous la futaie,
De crainte que son pied n'effraie
Les rapides petits oiseaux.

Sous le muguet et la pervenche
L'enfant ruse cache ses rets,
Ou bien sous l'aubepine blanche
Ou tombent, comme une avalanche,
Linots, pinsons, chardonnerets.

Parfois d'une souple baguette
D'osier vert ou de romarin
Il fait un piege, et puis il guette
Les petits oiseaux en goguette
Qui viennent becqueter son grain.

Etourdi, joyeux et rapide,
Bientot approche un oiselet:
Il regarde d'un air candide,
S'enhardit, goute au grain perfide,
Et se prend la patte au filet.

Et l'oiseleur Amour l'emmene
Loin des coteaux frais et fleuris,
Loin des buissons et de la plaine,
Et, chaque soir, sa cage est pleine
Des petits oiseaux qu'il a pris.




PAUL BOURGET


PRAETERITA

Novembre approche,--et c'est le mois charmant
Ou, devinant ton ame a ton sourire,
Je me suis pris a t'aimer vaguement,
           Sans rien dire.

Novembre approche,--ah! nous etions enfants,
Mais notre amour fut beau comme un poeme.
--Comme l'on fait des reves triomphants
           Lorsqu'on aime!--

Novembre approche,--assis au coin du feu,
Malade et seul, j'ai songe tout a l'heure
A cet hiver ou je croyais en Dieu,
           Et je pleure.

Novembre approche,--et c'est le mois beni
Ou tous les morts ont des fleurs sur leur pierre,
Et moi je porte a mon reve fini
           Sa priere.


ROMANCE

Pourquoi cet amour insense
N'est-il pas mort avec les plantes
Qui l'enivraient, l'ete passe,
D'odeurs puissantes et troublantes?

Pourquoi la bise, en emportant
La feuille jaunie et fanee,
N'en a-t-elle pas fait autant
De mon amour de l'autre annee?

Les roses des rosiers en fleur,
L'hiver les cueille et les desseche;
Mais la blanche rose du coeur,
Toujours froissee, est toujours fraiche.

Il n'en finit pas de courir,
Le ruisseau de pleurs qui l'arrose,
Et la melancolique rose
N'en finit pas de refleurir.


DEPART

Accoude sur le bastingage
Et regardant la grande mer,
Je respire ce que degage
De liberte ce gouffre amer.

Le large pli des houles bleues,
Que les vents poussent au hasard
D'au dela d'un millier de lieues,
Souleve le bateau qui part.

Sensation farouche et gaie,
Je vais donc vivre sans lien!
Ah! que mon ame est fatiguee
D'avoir tant travaille pour rien!

Vains devoirs d'un monde frivole,
Plaisirs factices de deux jours,
Coupable abus de la parole,
Efforts mesquins, tristes amours,

Tout de ce qui fut moi s'efface
A l'horizon mysterieux,
Et le libre, l'immense espace,
S'ouvre a mon coeur comme a mes yeux.


NUIT D'ETE

O nuit, o douce nuit d'ete, qui viens a nous
Parmi les foins coupes et sous la lune rose,
Tu dis aux amoureux de se mettre a genoux,
Et sur leur front brulant un souffle frais se pose!

O nuit, o douce nuit d'ete, qui fais fleurir
Les fleurs dans les gazons et les fleurs sur les branches,
Tu dis aux tendres coeurs des femmes de s'ouvrir,
Et sous les blonds tilleuls errent des formes blanches!

O nuit, o douce nuit d'ete, qui sur les mers
Alanguis le sanglot des houles convulsees,
Tu dis aux isoles de n'etre pas amers,
Et la paix de ton ciel descend dans leurs pensees.

O nuit, o douce nuit d'ete, qui parles bas,
Tes pieds se font legers et ta voix endormante,
Pour que les pauvres morts ne se reveillent pas,
Eux qui ne peuvent plus aimer, o nuit aimante!


EPILOGUE

Le Fantome est venu de la trentieme annee.
Ses doigts vont s'entr'ouvrir pour me  prendre la main,
La fleur de ma jeunesse est a demi fanee,
Et l'ombre du tombeau grandit sur mon chemin.

Le Fantome me dit avec ses levres blanches:
"Qu'as-tu fait de tes jours passes, homme mortel?
Ils ne reviendront plus t'offrir leurs vertes branches.
Qu'as-tu cueilli sur eux dans la fraicheur du ciel?"

--"Fantome, j'ai vecu comme vivent les hommes:
J'ai fait un peu de bien, j'ai fait beaucoup de mal.
Il est dur aux songeurs, le siecle dont nous sommes,
Pourtant j'ai preserve mon intime Ideal!...."

Le Fantome me dit: "Ou donc est ton ouvrage?"
Et je lui montre alors mon reve interieur,
Tresor que j'ai sauve de plus d'un noir naufrage,
--Et ces vers de jeune homme ou j'ai mis tout mon coeur.

Oui! tout entier: espoirs heureux, legers caprices,
Coupables passions, spleenetique rancoeur,
J'ai tout dit a ces vers, tendres et surs complices.
Qu'ils temoignent pour moi, Fantome, et pour ce coeur!

Que leur sincerite, Juge d'en haut, te touche,
Et, comme aux temps lointains des reves nimbes d'or,
Pardonne, en ecoutant s'echapper de leur bouche,
Ce cri d'un coeur reste chretien: _Confiteor!_




ABEL HERMANT


L'ETOILE

Je suis le Chaldeen par l'Etoile conduit
Vers un but inconnu que moi-meme j'ignore.
Quelle main alluma cet astre dans ma nuit?
Quel spectacle a mes yeux revelera l'Aurore?

N'importe.--Dans la nuit je vais. La nudite
Du jour blessait mes yeux. L'ombre chaste est un voile.
Ce flambeau, qu'il m'egare ou me guide, est clarte:
L'Astre, meme trompeur, est toujours une etoile.

Trouverai-je en sa creche, ainsi que dans un nid,
Un enfant? Me mettrai-je a genoux? Que m'importe!
J'ai recueilli la myrrhe et le baume benit:
Je respire en marchant les parfums que je porte.

CHARLES D'ORLEANS.

1391-1465.

Father of Louis XII, was taken prisoner in the battle of Agincourt
(1415) and passed the next twenty-five years of his life in captivity
in England. In this long leisure he developed his talent for poetry,
and on his return to France he made his residence at Blois a
gathering-point for men of letters. His poetical work marks the
utmost attainment in outward grace of expression in the treatment of
conventional subjects in the traditional fixed forms. Now and then
there is a more personal strain which suggests the more distinctly
modern lyric of Villon; but he is not to be compared with Villon in
originality of view, sincerity of feeling, or directness and intensity
of utterance.

His works were not published till the eighteenth century. The
best edition is that of Ch. d'Hericault, 2 vols., 1874 (_Nouvelle
collection Jannet-Picard_). Charles d'Orleans also wrote some of his
poems in English; these were published by G. W. Taylor in 1827 for the
Roxburghe Club.

Charles d'Orleans_, 1861; Robert Louis Stevenson, _Familiar Studies of
Men and Books_, London, 1882.

the imperfect and conditional _oi_, from an earlier _ei_, continued
to be written till late in the eighteenth century, long after in

_haissent_, _y_ is found frequently in the older spelling for _i_,
especially when final. 5. DESCONFORT= _decouragement_. 8. SI FAIS =

Fourriers d'Este sont venus._" 13. VERT, feminine ; in adjectives of

FRANCOIS VILLON.

1431-146-?.

Poet and vagabond, he led a most irregular life, twice narrowly
escaped hanging, and composed many of his poems in prison. He was a
poet of great originality, for he broke away from the conventional
subjects and the allegorizing habit of the Middle Ages and gave to the
lyric a personal note and a depth and poignancy of feeling that made
it almost a new creation, though he still adhered mainly to the
traditional forms and showed a special preference for the ballade.
Most of his ballades are introduced into his main works, the _Petit
Testament_ and the _Grand Testament_, which are entirely personal in
contents.

His works were first published in 1489; Marot prepared an edition in
the following century, Paris, 1533; they were not reprinted in the
seventeenth century; convenient recent editions are those of P.
L. Jacob (Paul Lacroix), 1854; P. Jannet (_Nouvelle collection
Jannet-Picard_) and A. Longnon, 1892.

CLEMENT MAROT.

1497-1544.

He abandoned the law to live at court and write verses. After his
first successes, he became page in the household of Marguerite of
Navarre, and continued to enjoy her protection and that of her
brother, Francis I., though this could not save him, when accused
of heresy because of the welcome that he gave to the ideas of the
Reformation, from the necessity of twice fleeing to Italy for safety.
In spite of some deeper notes and in spite of his translation of the
first fifty Psalms, which is used in French Protestant churches, he
was by no means a religious reformer. He was essentially a court poet,
putting into graceful verse, ballades, rondeaux, epistles, epigrams,
etc., the trifles, jests, sallies, and elegant badinage that delighted
courtly society.

PIERRE DE RONSARD.

1524-1585.

The greatest French poet of the Renaissance, he entered the household
of the Duke of Orleans at the age of ten, spent three years as page
of James V. of Scotland, and traveled much about Europe on various
embassies. At eighteen, attacked by deafness, he withdrew to the
college of Coqueret and was won to poetry by study of the ancients. It
was then that a common love for the classical literatures and a common
zeal for imitating their beauties in French bound him to the other
young men who with him called themselves the Pleiad and set themselves
to the task of renewing French literature in the image of the
literatures of antiquity. In 1550, the year after the appearance of
the manifesto of the young school, the _Defense et Illustration de la
langue francaise_ of du Bellay, he published a volume of odes. His
fame was instant and immense; he returned in glory to court, and for
forty years the authority of his example was hardly questioned. His
talent was exercised in almost all kinds of verse, chansons, sonnets,
elegies, eclogues, hymns, epistles, and even in the epic, where,
however, his experiment, _la Franciade_, was a complete failure,
abandoned when but four of the proposed twelve cantos were finished.
But his genius was essentially lyric. The ode was his special
contribution to French verse; in it he followed the classical form
with its divisions into strophe, antistrophe, and epode, sometimes in
direct imitation of Pindar, Anacreon, Theocritus, or Horace. His best
work is that in which he freed himself most fully from the influence
of a model. His deepest and truest note's are those that celebrate the
pleasures of this life, the delights of nature, and the inevitable
"cold obstruction" of death.

JOACHIM DU BELLAY.

1525-1560.

After Ronsard the foremost poet of the Pleiad. He was of an
illustrious family, but, cut off from a brilliant public career by
ill health and deafness, he sought consolation in letters. He even
preceded Ronsard in inaugurating the literary reform, issuing the
manifesto of the new movement, his _Defense et Illustration de la
langue francaise_, his collection of sonnets called _Olive_, and a
_Recueil de poesies_, all in 1549. Shortly afterwards he accompanied
his cousin, Cardinal du Bellay, to Rome; the admiration which the
historic associations of the city excited in him and his disgust
at the intrigues of the court and the corruptions of Italian life,
mingled with homesickness for the pleasant sights and quiet air of his
native Anjou, inspired the two collections of sonnets which are his
best, the _Antiquites romaines_, translated by Spenser in 1591, and
the _Regrets_.

Works: _Olive_, _Recueil de poesies_, 1549; _Premier livre des
antiquites de Rome_, 1558; _Jeux rustiques_, 1558; _les Regrets_,
1559 ; _Oeuvres_, 1569. Recent editions are : Oeuvres completes, par
Marty-Laveaux, 2 vols., 1866-67; _Oeuvres choisies_, par Becq de
Fouquieres, 1876.

demonstrative, _celui_. The reference is of course to Jason. 9. USAGE,
_experience_. 11. QUAND REVERRAY-JE, etc., cf. Homer's Odyssey, I, 58.
18. LOYRE, the name of the river is now feminine. 19. LIRE, a little
village in Anjou, was the birth-place of du Bellay. D'UN VANNEUR DE
BLE AUX VENTS. From the collection entitled _Jeux rustiques_.


15. 8. CESTE, cette. 10. J'AHANNE = je me fatigue.


AGRIPPA D'AUBIGNE.

1550-1630.

Soldier as well as poet, he was a leader of the Huguenots in the wars
that ended with the accession of Henry IV. After the assassination of
Henry IV., his safety became more and more threatened in France, and
he withdrew finally to Geneva. His main work is a long descriptive
and narrative poem, but in many parts essentially lyrical, _les
Tragiques_, a fierce picture of France in the civil wars. In his
lyrics, which comprise _stances, odes_, and _elegies_, he is a
follower of the tradition of Ronsard.

Works: _Les Tragiques_, 1616; a recent edition is by L. Lalanne, 1857;
also in the _Oeuvres completes_, par MM. Reaume et de Caussade, 4
vols., 1873-77.

For reference: Pergameni, _la Satire au seizieme siecle et les
Tragiques d'Agrippa d'Aubigne_, 1881; E. Faguet, _le Seizieme siecle_,
1893.

15. L'HYVER. 14. IRONDELLES, _hirondelles_. 19. N'ESLOIGNE, _ne
s'eloigne de_.

16. 2. COMME IL FIT, i.e. _comme il alluma des flammes_. 10. SEREINES,
_sirenes_. 14. USAGE, _fruition_.


JEAN BERTAUT.

1552-1611.

A man by no means of the poetic stature of Ronsard, du Bellay, and
D'Aubigne; he found great favor in his day, but his lyric note was not
powerful enough to endure long. He is most successful in the graceful
expression of a natural melancholy, as in the example here given. He
was a follower, in moderation, of the Pleiad.

Works : _Recueil des oeuvres poetiques de J. Bertaut_, l601; appeared
again enlarged in 1605 ; _Recueil de quelques vers amoureux_, 1602 :
both collections are included in _Oeuvres poetiques_, 1620; a
recent edition is edited by A. Cheneviere, 1891 (_Bibliotheque
elzevirienne_). CHANSON. 27. DEMEURE, _delay_.

17. 4. FAY, _fais_.

23. VOY, _vois_.

25. VY, _vis_.


MATHURIN REGNIER.

1573-1613.

Though bred to the church and early settled in a good living, he led
a life that was hardly edifying. He possessed brilliant talents, but
failed to make the most of them. He was indolent and fond of good
living, and was restive under discipline, as is evident in his work
and in his irritation at Malherbe. He had a gift of keen observation,
and his satires excelled in interest what he composed in the more
lyrical forms of ode and elegy.

Works : _Oeuvres_, 1608, 1612 ; recent editions are those of Viollet
le Duc, 1853 (_Bibliotheque elzevirienne_), and E. Courbet, 1875.

For reference : J. Vianey, _Mathurin Regnier_, 1896.


FRANCOIS DE MALHERBE.

1555-1628.

He marks an epoch in the history of French letters. Boileau's famous
phrase, "enfin Malherbe vint," dates from him the beginning of worthy
French poetry. What did begin with him was that tradition of refinement,
elegance, polish and perfect propriety of phrase that continued to rule
French literature for two centuries. He lent the influence of a very
positive voice to the growing demand for a standard of authority in
grammar and versification and for recognized canons of criticism. The
lyrical impulse in him was small, but some of his lines live in virtue
of the finished propriety and harmony of expression.

Works: _Oeuvres_, 1628; the best edition is that of L. Lalanne, 5 vols.,
1862-69 {_Collection des Grands Ecrivains_).

For reference: G. Allais, _Malherbe_, 1891; F. Brunot, _la Doctrine
de Malherbe_, 1891; F. Brunetiere, _l'Evolution des genres_, vol. i,
1890; _Etudes critiques sur l'histoire de la litterature francaise_,
vol. v, 1893.

21. CONSOLATION A M. DU PERIER. 5. TITHON, Tithonus, who obtained from
the gods immortality but not eternal youth. After age had completely
wasted and shriveled him he was changed into a grasshopper. 6. PLUTON,
Pluto, god of the nether world, the abode of the dead. 8. ARCHEMORE,
Archemorus or Opheltes, son of Lycurgus, king of Nemea, died in
infancy from the bite of a serpent.

22. I. FRANCOIS, Francis I.; his oldest son, Francis, born in 1517,
died suddenly in 1526, and Charles V. was suspected of having had him
poisoned, and dire vengeance was wreaked upon the person of Sebastian
de Montecuculli, cupbearer of Charles V. The suspicions proved to be
wholly groundless. 5. ALCIDE, Alcides, by which name Hercules was known
till he consulted the oracle of Delphi. 9. LA DURANCE, a river in
southwestern France, flowing into the Rhone below Avignon. After
beginning an agressive campaign in this part of France in the summer of
1536, the Spaniards were in September forced to a disastrous retreat.
13. DE MOI, _for my own part_; Malherbe had lost his first two children,
 Henry in 1587 and Jourdaine in 1599. 27. LOUVRE; the palace of the
Louvre, begun in 1541 by Francis

I. on the site of a royal chateau built by Philip Augustus, and added
to by his successors, was a royal residence until the Revolution.

23. CHANSON. 20. en sa liberte, i.e. free from her pursuit. PARAPHRASE
DU PSAUME CXLV. This is Psalm CXLVI in our English Bible.


JEAN RACINE.

1639-1699.

A dramatic genius of the highest order. But besides being a great
dramatist he was a consummate master of language. The choruses in
Esther and Athalie are excellent examples of the kind of lyric that
the tendencies represented by Malherbe permitted. The extract here
given is from Esther, Act III. The approach to the language of the
Psalms is evident throughout.


JEAN-BAPTISTE ROUSSEAU.

1670-1741.

The chief representative of the serious lyric in the eighteenth
century. This ode is a favorable example of the form which lyric
utterance assumed in this philosophizing century and under the
tradition of poetic dignity and propriety.

27. ODE A LA FORTUNE. 16. SYLLA (138-78 B.C.), the enemy of Marius and
author of the bloody proscription against the adherents of his rival.
17. ALEXANDRE, Alexander the Great. 18. ATTILA, king of the Huns from
434 to 453, who ravaged southern and western Europe from 450 to 452
and was known as "the scourge of God."

28. 16. LE RETOUR, i.e. the adverse turn.


EVARISTE-DESIRE DESFORGES DE PARNY.

1753-1814.

He wrote mostly in a lighter and erotic vein. He had many admirers
in his day who styled him the French Tibullus. His influence is
perceptible in the style of Lamartine.

Works: _Poesies erotiques_, 1778; _Opuscules poetiques_, 1779,
enlarged in succeeding editions; _les Rosicroix_, 1807; _Oeuvres_, 5
vols., 1808; _Oeuvres choisies_, 1827.

For reference : Sainte-Beuve, _Causeries du lundi_, vol. xv;
_Portraits contemporains_, vol. iv; George Saintsbury, _Miscellaneous
Essays_, London, 1892.


NICOLAS GILBERT.

1751-1780.

He has often been compared with Chatterton and has owed much of his
fame to the unfounded legend that he was a child of genius brought to
an untimely death by poverty and lack of recognition. His satires on
the vices of his time enjoyed a temporary reputation, but his real
legacy to posterity is the well-known lines here given.

Works: _Oeuvres completes_, 1788, and frequently thereafter.


ROUGET DE L'ISLE.

1760-1836.

Though he wrote much in both prose and verse, nothing of his lives
except the _Marseillaise_, which has become the national song of
France. He composed both words and music in the night of April 25,
1792, while he was an officer of engineers at Strassburg. The last
stanza vas added later by another hand. The name, _la Marseillaise_,
comes from the fact that it was introduced to Paris by the troops from
Marseilles.

Works: _Essais en vers et en prose_, 1796.

For reference: J. Tiersot, _Rouget de l'Isle, son oeuvre, sa vie_,
1892.

32. LA MARSEILLAISE. 6. Beuille, Francois-Claude Amour, marquis de
(1739-1800), a devoted royalist, who planned the flight of Louis XVI.
When the king was captured at Varennes he fled to England, where he
died.


MARIE-ANDRE CHENIER.

1762-1794.

The most genuine poet of the eighteenth century. Born at Constantinople
of a Greek mother, he knew Greek early and fed himself on the Greek
poets, imbibing something of their spirit. His elegies, idyls, and odes
are not mere repetitions of the conventional commonplaces, but new,
original, and vigorous in idea and expression. He anticipated the
Romanticists in breaking over the received rules of versification and
in giving greater flexibility and variety to the Alexandrine line.

Works : _Poesies_, first published by H. de Latouche, 1819; later
editions are by Becq de Fouquieres, 1862 and 1872; G. de Chenier, with
new material, 3 vols., 1874; by Louis Moland, 2 vols., 1878-79.

For reference: Sainte-Beuve, _Portraits litteraires_, vol. i;
_Portraits contemporains_, vols, ii and v; _Causeries du lundi_, vol.
iv; _Nouveaux lundis_, vol. iii; E. Faguet, _le Dix- huitieme siecle_,
1890; E. Caro, _la Fin du dix-huitieme siecle_, vol. ii, 1882; J.
Haraszti, _la Poesie d'Andre Chenier_, 1892.

32. LA JEUNE CAPTIVE. This, as well as the _Iambes_ following, was
written in the Saint-Lazare prison shortly before Chenier was sent
to the guillotine. The young captive was Mlle. Aimee de Coigny; she
escaped the guillotine and afterwards married M. de Montrond; she died
in 1820.

33. 18. PHILOMELE; Philomela was daughter of Pandion, king of Athens.
Pursued by Tereus, king of Thrace, she was changed into a nightingale.
The name is frequently employed in poetry for the nightingale.

34. 16. PALES, a Roman divinity of flocks and shepherds.

35. IAMBES. 23. BAVUS, a conventional name; it is not clear who was in
the poet's mind.


MARIE-JOSEPH CHENIER.

1764-1811.

A younger brother of Andre Chenier, enjoyed a great reputation as a
dramatic poet and critic. Aside from the _Chant du depart_, which had
a reputation approaching that of the _Marseillaise_, he is hardly to
be considered as a lyric poet.

Works: _Oeuvres completes_, 8 vols., 1823-1826; _Poesies_, 1844.

37. LE CHANT du DEPART. 9. De BARRA, DE VIALA; Agricole Viala and
Francois-Joseph Barra (properly Bara) were both young boys, thirteen
and fourteen years of age, who fell fighting with the revolutionary
armies, the former in the Vendee, the latter near Avignon. To both the
Convention voted the honors of burial in the Pantheon. Their names are
often coupled, as here.


ANTOINE-VINCENT ARNAULT.

1766-1834.

He wrote a number of tragedies and a collection of fables that were
admired in their day, but his name is best preserved for the larger
public by this brief elegy, which is found in most anthologies. The
circumstances attending its composition, on the eve of his departure
from France after his banishment in January, 1816, are related by
Sainte-Beuve, _Causeries du lundi_, vol. vii, in the course of his
notice of Arnault, which should be consulted.


FRANCOIS-RENE, VICOMTE DE CHAUTEAUBRIAND.

1768-1848.

An enormous literary force at the beginning of this century; M. E.
Faguet calls him the "greatest date in French letters since the
Pleiad." But the instrument of his power was prose. His attempts in
verse were poor. Yet he exercised a direct influence towards the
renewal of lyric poetry, as has been indicated in the introduction.

For reference: E. Faguet, _Etudes litteraires sur le dix-neuvieme
siecle_, 1887 ; F. Brunetiere, _l'Evolution de la poesie lyrique au
dix-neuvieme siecle_, vol. i, 1894.

39. LE MONTAGNARD EXILE. Introduced into the prose tale, _le Dernier
des Abencerages_ (1807). "J'en avais compose les paroles pour un air
des montagnes d'Auvergne remarquable par sa douceur et sa simplicite."
(Author's note.) 24. la Dore, a rapid stream in the department Puy-
de-Dome, flowing into the Allier. 27. l'airain, i.e. the bell.


MARIE-ANTOINE DESAUGIERS.

1772-1827.

He represents a domain of the lyric that has always been industriously
tilled in France, that of the chanson. The tradition of the song
is distinctly bacchanalian, and rarely has it claimed serious
consideration as literature. But Desaugiers now and then foreshadows
the larger and more serious treatment the _chanson_ was to receive at
the hands of Beranger and Dupont.

Works: _Chansons et Poesies diverses_, 3 vols., 1808-1816; a _Choix de
chansons_ appeared in 1858; another in 1859, and others since.

For reference: Sainte-Beuve, _Portraits contemporains_, vol. v; George
Saintsbury, _Miscellaneous Essays_, London, 1892.


CHARLES NODIER.

1780-1844.

Promoted the romantic movement by his personal contact with the group
of young writers that he drew around him more than by what he himself
wrote. He was one of those who felt and transmitted the influence of
Germany. He is better known by his stories than by his verse.

Works : _Essais d'un jeune barde_, 1804 ; _Poesies diverses_, 1827.

For reference : Mme. Mennessier-Nodier, _Charles Nodier, episodes et
souvenirs de sa vie_, 1867 ; Sainte-Beuve, _Portraits litteraires_,
vol. i.


PIERRE-JEAN DE BERANGER.

1780-1857.

The first in rank of the _chansonniers_. The chanson in his hands took
on a breadth, a meaning, and a seriousness that it had never before
possessed, and that make him secure of a place in the literature of
his country. He used the song largely as a vehicle for his political
opinions, even as a political weapon. The object of his attack was the
monarchy of the restoration and the pre-revolutionary ideas which it
tried to revive, and his weapon was formidable because it was so
well fitted to be caught up and wielded by the masses of the people.
Beranger was popular in the more original sense of the word. He
appealed to the masses by his ideas, which were those of the average
man, and by the form which he gave them and the efficient aid of the
current airs to which he wedded them, so that his words not only
reached the ears of an audience far wider than that of the readers of
books, but found a lodgment in their memories. Works: The successive
collections of _Chansons_ appeared in 1815, 1821, 1825, 1828, 1833;
_Oevres posthumes_, and _Oeuvres completes_, 2 vols., 1857.

For reference: Saint-Beuve, _Portraits contemporains_, vol. i;
_Causeries du lundi_, vols, ii, xv; _Nouveaux lundis_, vol. i; E.
Caro, _Poetes et romanciers_, 1888; C. Coquelin in _The Century_, vol.
xxiv, with portraits.

43. LE ROI D'YVETOT (May, 1813) is perhaps the most famous of his
songs. Yvetot is a small town in Normandy, near Havre. The lords of
Yvetot were given the title of king in the fifteenth century. The
reference of the song to Napoleon is clear.

44. 11. BAN; _lever le ban_ means to call out one's vassals or
subjects. 13. TIRER AU BLANC, to shoot at a target.

45. LE VILAIN. 30.LE LEOPARD; the French heralds describe the device
of the English coat of arms as a _lion leoparde_; so the French often
use the leopard as a symbol for the English.

46. 3. LA LIGUE, the Catholic League, a union of Catholics between
1576 and 1596, principally to secure the supremacy of their religion;
it became the partisan of the Duc de Guise against Henry I. and Henry
IV., fomented civil strife, allied itself with Spain, and became
guilty of cruel excesses. MON HABIT 20. Socrate: the poverty of
Socrates is notorious. 27. FETE: a person's _fete_ is the day of the
saint whose name he bears.

47. 17. DES RUBANS; little bits of ribbon are worn in the buttonhole
by members of the Legion of Honor, established by Napoleon in 1802.
Membership in it is a purely honorary distinction, conferred by the
government for conspicuous services of any kind, civil as well as
military, and usually much coveted. Beranger refused all such favors
from the government. 26. METTRE POUR JAMAIS HABIT BAS, i.e. _mourir_.

48. LES ETOILES QUI FILENT, "shooting stars" (Jan., 1820). This poem
is based upon the popular superstition that connects human destinies
with the stars, and interprets a shooting star as the passing of a
human life.

49. 2. C'ETAIT A QUI LE NOURRIRAIT, each strove to outdo the other in
feeding him.

50. LES SOUVENIRS DU PEUPLE. This is one of the poems that contributed
to increase the prestige of the name of Napoleon. 9. BIEN ... QUE; the
parts of the conjunction are sometimes thus separated.

51. 10. CHAMPAGNE, previous to the Revolution a political division of
France, having Lorraine on the east and Burgundy on the south. Like
most other provinces it belonged formerly to independent princes. It
came to the kings of France by the marriage of Philip IV. in the
last half of the thirteenth century. Since the Revolution all these
historical divisions have been supplanted by the _departements_, new
administrative districts intended to obliterate the old boundaries.
But the old names are still familiarly used. Champagne was invaded in
1814 by an army of the powers allied against Napoleon. 18. S'ASSOIT,
instead of the usual _s'assied_ of cultivated speech, is in keeping
with the unlettered condition and familar tone of the speaker.

52. LES FOUS. Perhaps the word "cranks" comes nearest to giving the
force of the title. 22. SAUF A, _reserving the privilege of_.

53. 5. SAINT-SIMON; Claude-Henri, comte de Saint-Simon (1760-1825),
was the founder of French socialism. He demanded the application of
the principle of association to the production and distribution of
wealth. 13. Francois- Marie-Charles FOURIER (1772-1837), the founder
of Fourierism, advocated a social reform in the direction of
communism, and proposed to reorganize society in large groups, or
phalanxes, living together in a perfect community in one building,
called a phalanstery. Such communities as Brook Farm were attempts at
a practical application of Fourier's ideas. See O. B. Frothingham's
Life of George Ripley. 21. Barthelemy-Prosper ENFANTIN (1796-1864) was
a follower of Saint-Simon and developed his doctrines. His means for
securing the emancipation and equality of woman was the abolition of
marriage.


CHARLES-HUBERT MILLEVOYE.

1782-1816.

Author of several poetical tales of chivalry and a considerable number
of elegies, is remembered for hardly anything but these celebrated
lines:

Works: _Oeuvres_, 5 vols., 1814-16; a collection of his _Poesies_ is
published in one volume, with a notice by Sainte- Beuve.

54. LA CHUTE DES FEUILLES. 19. EPIDAURE; Epidaurus, a town in Argolis
on the Saronic gulf, the chief seat of the worship of Aesculapius, the
god of the healing art.


MADAME MARCELINE DESBORDES-VALMORE.

1786-1859.

Is still ranked well among the lyric poets of the first part of the
century, though the celebrity that she enjoyed for a time has passed.
Though her language still has a flavor of the eighteenth century, the
note of emotion is direct and sincere. The theme that best inspired
her was love--love betrayed and disappointed.

Works: Poesies, 1818; _les Pleurs_, 1833; _Pauvres Fleurs_, 1839;
_Contes en vers pour les enfants_, Lyon, 1840; _Bouquets et prieres_,
1843; there is a selection, with notice by Sainte-Beuve, with the
title: _Poesies de Madame Desbordes-Valmore_.

For reference: Sainte-Beuve, _Portraits contemporains_, vol. ii;
_Causeries du lundi_, vol. xiv; _Nouveaux lundis_, xii; these notices
are collected in a volume: _Madame Desbordes-Valmore, sa vie et sa
correspondance_; Montesquiou-Fezensac, _Felicite, etude sur la poesie
de Marceline Desbordes-Valmore_, 1894.

57. LES ROSES DE SAADI. Saadi (1195-1296) was a Persian poet; one of
his works is the Gulistan, or Garden of Roses.


ALPHONSE-MARIE-LOUIS DE LAMARTINE. 1790-1869

The first great poet of the century and still one of the greatest. He
passed a quiet youth in the shelter of home influences on his father's
estate near Macon, receiving his most lasting impressions from his
mother's instruction, from the fields and woods, and from certain
favorite books, among which were the Bible and Ossian. This education
was supplemented by a visit to Italy in 1811-12, memorable for the
episode of Graziella, and a short service in the royal guards. His
first volume, the _Meditations poetiques_ (1820), was something
entirely new in French letters and made him famous at once. These
poems were saturated with the poet's personality and informed with his
emotions; and to communicate his pervading melancholy he found
the secret of lines which, while they did not yet have the color,
brilliancy, and variety that the Romanticists presently gave to verse,
charmed the ear with a harmony and a music unattained before. His
long poems, with more or less of philosophical intention, especially
_Jocelyn_ (1836), are important works, but it was as a lyric poet that
he made his chief impression.

Works: _Meditations poetiques_, 1820; _Nouvelles Meditations_,
1823; _Harmonies poetiques et religieuses_, 1830; _Recueillements
poetiques_, 1839; _Poesies inedites_, 1839; _Poesies inedites_, 1873;
republished under the same names in various collected editions of his
_Oeuvres_ since 1860.

For reference: Faguet, _Etudes litteraires sur le dix-neuvieme
siecle_, 1887; Sainte-Beuve,_ Premiers lundis_, vol. i; _Portraits
contemporains_, vol. i; F. Brunetiere, _Evolution de la poesie
lyrique_, vol. i; _Histoire et litterature_, vol. iii, 1892; F.
Reyssie, _la Jeunesse de Lamartine_, 1891; E. Deschanel, _Lamartine_,
2 vols., 1893; J. Lemaitre, _les Contemporains_, vol. vi, 1896; E.
Zyromski, _Lamartine poete lyrique_, 1898.

58. LE LAC. Written September 17-23, 1817; from _les Meditations
poetiques_. The lake here celebrated is Lake Bourget in Savoy. Here
the poet met in 1816 Mme. Charles, wife of the well known physicist,
with whom he fell very much in love and who is immortalized by him
under the names Julie and Elvire. She died Dec. 18, 1817. Cf. Anatole
France, _l'Elvire de Lamartine_, 1893. When this poem was written
Lamartine already knew that she was hopelessly ill. This experience
of his colors many poems of his first two volumes. _Le Lac_ has often
been set to music; most successfully by the Swiss composer Niedermeyer
(1802-1861). For interesting variants in the text see Reyssie, _la
Jeunesse de Lamartine_, p. 201.

L'AUTOMNE. November, 1819; from _les Meditations poetiques_.

61. 9. PEUT ETRE L'AVENIR, etc.; "allusion a l'attachement serieux
que le poete avait concu pour une jeune Anglaise qui fut depuis la
compagne de sa vie." (Commentaire de l'auteur.) LE SOIR. Spring of
1819; from _les Meditations poetiques_.

63. LE VALLON. Summer of 1819; from _les Meditations poetiques_. "Ce
vallon est situe dans les montagnes du Dauphine." (Commentaire de
l'auteur.)

65 9. PYTHAGORE; Pythagoras, a Greek philosopher of the sixth century
B.C., who is said to have taught the doctrine that the "organization
of the universe is an harmonious system of numerical ratios."
L'ISOLEMENT. September, 1818; from

_les Meditations poetiques_. Reyssie in the work above cited gives
interesting variants for this poem.

67 LE CRUCIFIX. 1818? From _les Nouvelles Meditations_. "Mon ami M. de
V(irieu), qui assistait aux derniers moments de Julie, me rapporta, de
sa part, le crucifix qui avait repose sur ses levres dans son agonie
... J'ecrivis, apres une annee de silence et de deuil, cette elegie."
(Commentaire de l'auteur.) Compare with this note the eleventh stanza
of the poem, which points back to the time of the Graziella affair.
See below.

70. ADIEU A GRAZIELLA. From _les Nouvelles Meditations_. Graziella,
whose heart Lamartine won during his visit to Naples in the winter
of 1811-12 and whom he abandoned, was the daughter of a Neapolitan
fisherman. She died soon afterward. Later the poet idealized her and
his relation to her and immortalized her memory in his works. Cf. _le
Premier regret_ below.

71. LES PRELUDES. 1822; from _les Nouvelles Meditations_. This poem,
addressed to Victor Hugo, consists of several divisions, in different
meters, only the last of which is here given. It inspired the
symphonic poem of Liszt by the same name.

73. HYMNE DE L'ENFANT A SON REVEIL. From _les Harmonies poetiques et
religieuses_.

76. LE PREMIER REGRET. From _les Harmonies poetiques et religieuses_.
It was inspired by the memory of Graziella. 7. MER DE SORRENTO, bay of
Naples; Sorrento is a small town on the bay, south-east of Naples.

77. 27. NEMI; the lake is in the hollow of an extinct volcano, in the
Alban mountains, a few miles southeast of Rome.

81. STANCES. From _les Nouvelles Meditations_. 18. MEMNON, son of

Greeks connected with Memnon various ancient monuments and buildings,
especially the great temple at Thebes and one of the colossi of
Amenophis III., currently called the statue of Memnon; legend reported
of it that when touched by the first rays of the dawn it gave forth a
musical sound.

83. LES REVOLUTIONS. From _les Harmonies poetiques et religieuses_.
Only the last of the three divisions of the poem is given here.

84. 20. SIBYLLES ANTIQUES; concerning the sibyls, sibylline books,
and sibylline leaves consult a classical dictionary. 23. VERBE; used
currently for the second person of the Trinity; here it goes back to
a passage in the first division of the poem, where speaking of God's
process of creation; he says:

      "Son Verbe court sur le neant!
    Il court, et la Nature a ce Verbe qui vole
    Le suit en chancelant de parole en parole,
    Jamais, jamais demain ce qu'elle est aujourd'hui!
    Et la creation, toujours, toujours nouvelle,
    Monte eternellement la symbolique echelle
      Que Jacob reva devant lui! "

85. 8. LES NOEUDS, knots of nautical reckoning.


ALFRED DE VIGNY.

1797-1863.

One of the great poets of the century. He surpassed most, if not all,
of his fellow Romanticists in the intellectual quality of his verse.
His lyrics are not merely the product of a moment of passion or of a
passing emotion; the strings of his lyre were not set vibrating by
every breeze that blew. The personal emotion from which the lyric
springs was with him subjected to the action of an intellectual
solvent, was generalized and made almost impersonal before it was
given form and expression. For this reason partly the bulk of his
poetry is small, not exceeding the limits of one small volume. But
there are few poems that one would be content to lose. One should
read, besides the two given here, _Moise, la Maison du Berger_ and _la
Mort du loup_. De Vigny's influence on the poetry of the latter half
of the century has been considerable.

Works: _Poemes_, 1822; _Poemes antiques et modernes_, 1826; _les
Destinees_, 1864; in the Oeuvres completes_, of which several editions
have appeared, the _Poesies_ make one volume.

86. LE COR. 1828. The story of the surprise of the rearguard of
Charlemagne by the Moors and of the death of Roland (Orlando in the
Italian poems) is told in the Chanson de Roland (end of the eleventh
century), the finest of the old French heroic poems. 19. FRAZONA ;
this name is not found on ordinary maps or in descriptions of this
region. MARBORE, a mountain of the Pyrenees. 21. GAVES, name given in
the Pyrenees to streams that descend from the mountains.

87. 11. RONCEVAUX, a Spanish village at the entrance to one of the
passes of the Pyrenees. 14. OLIVIER, Oli- ver, like Roland and Turpin
mentioned later, one of the twelve peers of Charlemagne, standard
figures in the old French poems that deal with Charlemagne.

88. 4. LUZ, ARGELES, villages in the department of Hautes- Pyrenees.
6. ADOUR, a river of France rising in the Pyrenees and flowing into
the Bay of Biscay. 15. SAINT Denis is the patron saint of France. 24.

Midsummernight's Dream_.

89. LA BOUTEILLE A LA MER, 1853. Bears the sub-title: _Conseil a un
jeune homme inconnu_. 19. Chatterton (1752-1770), the precocious
English poet who, failing to get recognition for his talents, was
reduced to destitution and ended his life by poison. Wordsworth wrote
of him in

_The Leech-Gatherer_:

    "I thought of Chatterton, the marvellous Boy,
    The sleepless Soul that perished in his pride."

For de Vigny he stood almost as the type of the poet; he used his
career as literary material in the narrative _Stello_ (1832) and in
the drama _Chatterton_ (1835). Gilbert, see p. 320. He is also brought
into _Stello_. MALFILATRE (1732-1767), a French poet who was tempted
by the praise given to his ode, _le Soleil fixe au milieu des
planetes_, to try a literary career at Paris and died in great
poverty. He has passed wrongly for an unappreciated genius.

9O. 27. TERRE-DE-FEU, Terra del Fuego.

91. 6. CES PICS NOIRS, _les pics San-Diego, San-Ildefonso_. (Author's
note.) 13. Reims, a city in Champagne, the center of the champagne
trade. 25. Ai, a town in Champagne, near Reims, noted for its wine;
the name is also applied to the wine.

8. DES FLORIDES; in speaking of both coasts of Florida the French
formerly used the plural.


VICTOR HUGO.

1802-1885.

The foremost literary figure of the century in France. His commanding
influence as the chief of the Romantic school and the champion of a
revolution in literary doctrine and practice has led to his being
generally considered in connection with the movement to which he gave
such a powerful impulse. But he was not merely a great party chief and
a great influence. He was also a great poet, and a great lyric
poet. He was that by reason of the breadth and variety of his lyric
performance, the surprising mastery of form that he showed, the new
capacities for picturesque expression that he discovered in the
language or created for it, the new possibilities of rhythm and melody
that he opened to it, and the range, power, and sincerity of many of
the thoughts and feelings to which he gave so sonorous and musical a
body. No doubt in a large part of his early work, as _les Orientales_,
the body was more to him than the spirit that it lodged. Poetry to
him was an art that had its technical side, like any other. The
development of its technical resources had a charm of its own, and he
had the artist's delight in skillful and exquisite workmanship. The

mastery that he attained was so perfect, he seemed so fully to exhibit
the utmost capacities of the language for the most various effects of
rhythm and harmony, that Theodore de Banville said of _la Legende des
siecles_ that it must be the Bible and the Gospel of every writer of
French verse. But he did not stop with the dexterity and virtuosity of
the craftsman. More and more he used the mastery that he had achieved
not for the mere pleasure of practicing or exhibiting it, but to give
fitting and adequate expression to feelings and to thoughts. The
domestic affections, the love of country, and the mystery of death had
the deepest hold upon him, and whenever he approaches these themes he
is almost sure to be genuine and sincere. His pity for the poor and
unfortunate was very tender, and was the real spring of a great deal
of his democracy, and he had a fine gift of wrathful indignation,
which was called into exercise especially by Napoleon III. No part of
his lyrical production is more spontaneous and genuine than many
poems of _Les Chatiments_. There was from the first a bent towards
philosophical reflection observable in him, and in the latter part
of his life, beginning with _les Contemplations_ and _la Legende des
siecles_, it preponderated more and more over the lyrical impulse,
though the latter was never reduced to silence for long.

Works: _Odes et Poesies diverses_, 1822; _Nouvelles Odes_, 1824;
_Odes et Ballades_, 1826, 1828; _les Orientales_, 1829; _les Feuilles
d'Automne_, 1831; _les Chants du crepuscule_, 1835; _les Voix

convenient form in which they are now to be found is the _ne varietur_
edition of Hetzel-Quantin in 16mo, at two francs a volume; the volumes
correspond to those given above, except that the first three are all
included in the one _Odes et Ballades_.

95. LES DJINNS. August, 1828; from _les Orientales_. The poem is
especially noteworthy from a technical point of view. The quiet
before the descent of the spirits, their approach, their fury, their
receding, and the quiet that follows, are suggested by the movement of
the lines. The motto is from Dante's _Inferno_, Canto v, 46-49; he is
describing the tormented spirits of the carnal malefactors "Who reason
subjugate to appetite." Djinns are spirits of Mohammedan popular
belief, created of fire, and both good and evil. The vowel is not
nasal.

97. 25. PROPHETE, Mohammed.

99. ATTENTE. 1828; from _les Orientales_. The motto is Spanish, "I was
waiting in despair."

100. EXTASE. November, 1828; from _les Orientales_. The motto is from
the Bible, Rev. i, 10. LORSQUE L'ENFANT PARAIT. May 18, 1830; from
_les Feuilles d'Automne_. _Les Feuilles d'Automne_ were largely the
reflection of the domestic affections of the poet. He had been married
in 1822, and had at this time three children, Leopoldine, Charles, and
Victor.

102. 17. ENNEMIS; the reference is doubtless to the literary opponents
of Hugo; the struggle between the champion of tradition and the
Romanticists brought many personal bitternesses. DANS L'ALCOVE SOMBRE.
Nov. 10, 1831; from _les Feuilles d'Automne_. The motto is from a
poem, _la Veillee_, addressed by Sainte-Beuve to Hugo on the birth of
his son Francois-Victor, Oct. 21, 1828.

103. 19. lys, _lis_; this spelling is usual with Victor Hugo and
frequent in this century, especially with later writers.

1O4. 27. CHIMERE has here more the force of _cauchemar_. NOUVELLE
CHANSON SUR UN VIEIL AIR. Feb. 18, 1834; from _les Chants du
crepuscule_.

106. "PUISQU'ICI-BAS." May 19, 1836; from _les Voix interieures_.

108. OCEANO NOX. July, 1836; from _les Rayons et les ombres_. The
title is from Vergil, _Aen._ ii, 250: _Vertitur interea caelum et ruit
Oceano nox_.

110. NUITS DE JUIN. 1837; from _les Rayons et les ombres_. "LA TOMBE
DIT A LA ROSE." June 3, 1837; from _les Voix interieures_. TRISTESSE
D'OLYMPIO. October, 1837; from _les Rayons et les ombres_. See the
discussion of this poem in Brunetiere, _Evolution de la poesie
lyrique_, i, 200 ff. His view is indicated in the following extract:
"Ces grands themes, les plus riches de tous,--la Nature, l'Amour et la
Mort,--dans le developpement desquels nous sommes convenus de chercher
et de verifier la mesure du pouvoir lyrique, Hugo les mele ou les fond
ensemble, il les enchevetre, il les complique, il les multiplie les
uns par les autres, et de cette complication, admirez les effets qu'il
tire.... C'est en effet ici qu'eclate, a mon avis, la superiorite
de la _Tristesse d'Olympio_ sur le _Lac_ de Lamartine ou sur le
_Souvenir_ de Musset, qu'on lui a si souvent, et a tort, preferes. Non
pas du tout, vous le pensez bien, que je veuille nier le charme pur
et penetrant du _Lac_, ou la douloureuse et poignante eloquence du
_Souvenir_! Incomparable elegie, le _Lac_ de Lamartine a pour lui la
discretion meme, l'elegance, l'ideale melancolie, la caresse ou la
volupte de sa plainte; et, dans le _Souvenir_ de Musset, nous le
verrons bientot, c'est la passion meme qui parle toute pure. Mais,
dans la _Tristesse d'Olympio_, de meme que les voix des instruments se
marient dans l'orchestre, la note aigue, dechirante et prolongee du
violon a la lamentation plus profonde et plus grave de l'alto, le
tumulte eclatant des cuivres aux sons plus percants de la flute,
tandis qu'au-dessus d'eux la voix humaine continue son chant d'amour
ou de colere, de haine ou d'adoration, c'est ainsi que la melodie tres
simple et comme elementaire du souvenir s'enrichit, s'augmente,
se renforce, et se soutient chez Hugo d'un accompagnement d'une
prodigieuse richesse, ou tout concourt ensemble, toute la nature et
tout l'homme, toute la poesie de l'amour, toute celle des bois et des
plaines, toute la poesie de la mort."

116. "A QUOI BON ENTENDRE." July, 1838; from the drama _Ruy Blas_, act
ii, scene I.

117. CHANSON. "SI VOUS N'AVEZ RIEN A ME DIRE." May, 18--; from _les
Contemplations_.

118. "QUAND NOUS HABITIONS TOUS ENSEMBLE." Sept. 4, 1844; from _les
Contemplations_. The poet's daughter Leopoldine had married Charles
Vacquerie in the summer of 1843. On the fourth of September of the
same year she was drowned, together with her husband, in the Seine
near Villequier. Her death was a great shock to Hugo, and the few
verses that we have from these years are full of the bitterness of
loss sweetened by remembrance of happy earlier days. Her memory is
everywhere present in the _Contemplations_; compare the following
poems.

119. 5. SI JEUNE ENCORE; _jeune_ refers of course to the subject; Hugo
was twenty-two when Leopoldine was born. "O SOUVENIRS! PRINTEMPS!
AURORE!" Villequier, Sept. 4, 1846; from _les Contemplations_. Notice
the date.

120. 2. MONTLIGNON, Saint-Leu, small places just out of Paris to the
north.

121. ARIOSTE, Ariosto (1474-1533), a famous Italian poet, author of
_Orlando Furioso_. "DEMAIN, DES L'AUBE." Sept. 3, 1847; from _les
Contemplations_. Notice the date. 21. DEMAIN, i.e. the anniversary of
his daughter's death.

122. 2. HARFLEUR, a small town on the Channel coast, a few miles from
Havre, near the mouth of the Seine. VENI, VIDI, VIXI. April, 1848;
from _les Contemplations_.

123. LE CHANT DE CEUX QUI S'EN VONT SUR MER. Dated: _En mer, 1er aout,
1852_. This and the next following poems, from _les Chatiments_, are
the expression of the poet's hatred for Napoleon III. This volume
was the direct fruit of his exile in consequence of his determined
opposition to the imperial ambitions of Napoleon. He had been active
in trying to organize resistance after the _coup d'etat_, and with
difficulty had evaded arrest and escaped to Brussels. After the
publication of his denunciatory volume, _Napoleon le Petit_, the
Belgian government expelled him. and he took refuge first in England,
whence he passed immediately to the island of Jersey, where he
arrived on the fifth of August, 1852. In 1855 residence in Jersey was
forbidden him and he removed to Guernsey, where he continued to reside
till the downfall of Napoleon I.

124. LUNA. July, 1853. 23. L'AN QUATRE-VINGT-ONZE, 1791, the beginning
of the French Revolution.

126. LE CHASSEUR NOIR. September, 1853. 27. SAINT ANTOINE; Saint
Anthony (250-356) was a native of Upper Egypt, withdrew to the desert,
and gave his life up to ascetic devotion in solitude and voluntary
poverty. Legend represents him as beset by tempting demons.

128. LUX. December, 1853. 9. Capets; the kings of France from the
accession of Hugh Capet in 987 to that of the house of Valois with
Philip VI. in 1328 were Capets.

129. ULTIMA VERBA. December, 1853. 4. Mandrin, a notorious bandit,
executed in 1755.

130. 3. Louvre, see note p. 318. 22. Sylla, see note p. 319. CHANSON.
"_Proscrit, regarde les roses_." May, 1854; from _les Quatre Vents de
l'esprit_, livre lyrique. Concerning the inexact rhyme _semai_: _mai_,
rare with Hugo, see _Revue politique et litteraire_, July 16, 1881.

132. EXIL. Between 1868 and 1881; from _les Quatre Vents de l'esprit_,
_livre lyrique_. 5. COLOMBE, his daughter Leopoldine. 6. ET TOI, MERE;
Mme Victor Hugo died in 1868. SAISON DES SEMAILLES. LE SOIR. From les_
Chansons des rues et des bois_. The poem is not dated; the volume
appeared in 1865.

133. 2. LABOURS, _plowed fields_. This seems almost to have been
written for the well-known painting of "The Sower" by Millet,
exhibited in 1850. However, Millet's sower is a young man. UN HYMNE
HARMONIEUX. From _les Quatre Vents de l'esprit_, the poem bears no
date.

134. PROMENADE DANS LES ROCHERS. From _les Quatre Vents de l'esprit_;
not dated.


AUGUSTE BRIZEUX.

1803-1858.

He is remembered for his simple and touching poems, full of the
landscape and of the rural life of his native Brittany. He also
translated Dante's Divine Comedy.

Works: _Marie_, 1835; _les Ternaires_, 1841 (the title of this
collection was later changed to _la Fleur d'or_); _les Bretons_, 1845;
_Histoires poetiques_, 1855; _Oeuvres completes_, 1861, 2 vols.;
_Oeuvres_, 4 vols., 1879-84.

For reference: Sainte-Beuve, _Portraits contemporains_, vols, ii and
iii; Lecigne, _Brizeux, sa vie et ses oeuvres_, Lille, 1898.


AUGUSTE BARBIER.

1805-1880.

He secured immediate fame by the vigorous satire of his first work,
_Iambes_, and he is probably still best remembered for this, though
later volumes, especially _Il Pianto_, contain work of more perfect
finish.

Works: _Iambes_, 1831; _La Popularite_, 1831; _Lazare_, 1833; _Il
Pianto_, 1833 (these are now included in one volume, _Iambes et
poemes_); Nouvelles Satires, 1837; _Chants civils et religieux_, 1841;
_Rimes heroiques_, 1843; _Sylves_, 1865.

For reference: Sainte-Beuve, _Portraits contemporains_, vol. ii.

138. L'IDOLE. May, 1831. The whole poem consists of five parts.


2. MESSIDOR, one of the months of the revolutionary calender,
beginning with the nineteenth of June. It was the first of the summer
months.


MADAME D'AGOULT.

1806-1876.

Marie-Sophie Catherine de Flavigny, comtesse d'Agoult, wrote under
the pseudonym Daniel Stern. Her work is mainly in prose, in history,
criticism and fiction, but she wrote a few lyrics marked by deep and
true sentiment. A biographical notice by L. de Ronchand will be found
in the second edition of her _Esquisses morales_, 1880.


FELIX ARVERS.

1806-1851.

He wrote mainly for the stage, and left but one volume of poems, _Mes
Heures perdues_, which are all forgotten save this famous sonnet. The
lady who inspired it is said to have been the daughter of Charles
Nodier, afterwards Mme. Mennessier-Nodier. _Mes Heures perdues_ was
reprinted in 1878, with a notice of Arvers by Th. de Banville.


GERARD DE NERVAL.

1808-1855.

Gerard Labrunie, known in letters as Gerard de Nerval, was one of the
group of young Romanticists who gathered around Hugo. Symptoms of
insanity developed early, and at different times he was an inmate
of an asylum. He finally committed suicide. He felt profoundly the
influence of German literature, and his lyrics show something of this
in the spiritual quality of their sentiment.

Works: _Elegies nationales et satires politiques_, 1827; translation
of Goethe's _Faust_, 1828; _la Boheme galante_, 1856; _Oeuvres
completes_, 5 vols., 1868.

For reference: Th. Gautier, _Histoire du romantisme_; _Portraits et
souvenirs litteraires_; Arvede Barine, _Nevroses_, 1898.

140. FANTAISIE. Gioacchino Antonio ROSSINI (1792-1868), one of the
foremost Italian composers of the century, author of William Tell
(1829), and other well-known operas. Wolfgang Amadeus MOZART was a
native of Austria, and one of the greatest musical geniuses that ever
lived. Among his works are the operas _Le Nozze di Figaro_ (1786),
_Don Giovanni_ (1787), _Die Zauberfloete_ (1791); the famous _Requiem_;
the _symphony in G minor_, etc. Karl Maria von WEBER (1786-1826),
one of the founders of German as opposed to Italian opera. _Der
Freischuetz_ is his most famous work.


HEGESIPPE MOREAU.

1810-1838.

In his short and unhappy struggle with poverty and illness he produced
a few graceful short stories and a thin volume of verse, _le Myosotis_
(1838), that reveals a genuine, though not remarkable, lyric gift.
See Sainte-Beuve, _Causeries du lundi_, vol. iv. The poems of _le
Myosotis_, and some others, now make vol. ii. of his _Oeuvres
completes_, 2 vols., 1890-91.

141. LA FERMIERE. This poem was sent as a New Year's gift to Madame
Guerard, who had taken the poet in and entertained him when ill.

142. 31. FILS DE LA VIERGE, "debris de toiles d'araignee que le vent
emporte"; air-thread, gossamer.


ALFRED DE MUSSET.

1810-1857.

A lyric poet of a comparatively narrow range, but within it
surpassingly genuine and spontaneous. Almost his only theme was the
passion of love, in some form or degree. But what he lacked in breadth
he made up in the directness and intensity of his accent, and these
eminently lyric qualities give his lyrics a distinction among those of
his country. He began as a Romanticist, but soon grew away from the
school of Hugo as it developed. With his negligence of form and his
surrender to the passion of the moment, he is the opposite of Gautier;
and the poets of the later school which derives from Gautier have
neglected and depreciated him.

Works: _Contes d'Espagne et d'Italie_, 1830; _le Spectacle dans un
fauteuil_, 1833; after this most of his poems appeared in the _Revue
des Deux Mondes_; they are now collected in _Premieres poesies_, 1
vol., containing the poems of the first two volumes and a few others,
and _Poesies nouvelles_, 1 vol., containing the _Nuits_, and the later
poems.

his poems.

145. STANCES. 1828; from _Contes d'Espagne et d'Italie_.
3. VESPREES; see note on 7, 10. LA NUIT DE MAI. May 1835. The
poet's _liaison_ with the novelist George Sand, begun in 1833, and
culminating in the Italian journey of 1834, with its successions of
passion, violent ruptures, and penitent reconciliations, was the
profoundest experience of his life, and the inspiration of many of
his poems, including the famous _Nuits_ of May, August, October and
December.

146. 21. PARESSEUX ENFANT; the charge of indolence had often already
been brought against Musset; cf. _ton oisivete_, 150. 3.

Pteleum, an ancient town of Thessaly (Iliad ii, 697.) 30. MESSA, city
and harbor of Laconia (Iliad ii, 582); Homer's epithet is "abounding
in doves." 31. PELION, a mountain in Thessaly ; Homer (Iliad ii, 757)
calls it "quivering with leaves."

148. 1. TITARESE, a river in Thessaly. Homer's epithet (Iliad ii, 751)
is "lovely". 3. OLOOSSONE, a city in Thessaly, called "white" also by
Homer (Iliad ii, 739). Camyre, no doubt Homer's Kameiros (Iliad ii,
656), which he calls "shining." It was situated on the island of
Rhodes; Musset neglects the geographical fact in bringing it into
connection with Oloossone.

149. 6. SON TERTRE VERT, St. Helena.

150. 13. LORSQUE LE PELICAN; this passage is one of the most famous of
French poetry. Compare Ronsard's reference to the pelican, p. 8,
1. 19. With this view of the poet's lot and mission compare that
expressed in _les Montreurs_ of Leconte de Lisle, p. 199, and in
_l'Art_ of Gautier, p. 190. The fable of the pelican giving his blood
to his young is current in the literature of the middle ages.

152. LA NUIT DE DECEMBRE. November, 1835. 18. EGLANTINE; a wild rose
was one of the prizes given the victors in the poetical contests
called the _Jeux Floraux_ held at Toulouse; it symbolizes distinction
in poetry.

153. 11. UN HAILLON DE OURPRE EN LAMBEAU symbolizes the power of youth
wasted in debauchery. 12. MYRTE; the myrtle was sacred to Venus.

154. 10. PISE, Pisa. 14. BRIGUES, a small town in the Rhone valley in
Switzerland, at the foot of the Simplon pass. 16. GENES, Genoa. 17.
VEVAY, a town on Lake Geneva. 19. LIDO, an island between Venice and
the sea, a favorite resort of the inhabitants of the city. Musset
calls it _affreux_, because with it he associated his quarrel with
George Sand.

159. STANCES A LA MALIBRAN. October, 1836. 11. MARIA FELICITA,
daughter and pupil of Manuel Garcia, afterwards Madame Malibran, by
which name she is remembered, was a remarkable singer (1808-1836).

24. PARTHENON: the Parthenon, completed in 438 B.C., was built under
the direction of Phidias, who was also the sculptor of the colossal
statue of Athena within the temple. The most famous work of Praxiteles
Was the statue of Aphrodite of Cnidus, not extant, but represented in
the Venus of the Capitol and the Venus de Medicis.

160. 26. CORILLA, a character in one of Rossini's operas. 27. ROSINA,
heroine of Rossini's _Il Barbiere di Seviglia_ (1816). 29. LE SAULE,
the song of "The Willow" in Rossini's _Otello_ (1816); cf. Shakspere's
_Othello_, iv, 3.

161. 9. LONDRE, usually spelled _Londres_; the _s_ is omitted here for
the metre. 21. GERICAULT, an important French painter (1790-1824); his
most famous picture is _Le Radeau de la Meduse_, now in the Louvre.

French naturalist (1769-1852).

162. 3. ROBERT, Leopold (1794-1835), a French painter of merit.
BELLINI, Vincenzo (1802-1835), an Italian composer of operas; among
his works are _La Somnambula_ (1831), _Norma_ (1831), and _I Puritani_
(1835). 5. CARREL, Armand (1800-1836), a French publicist, fatally
wounded in a duel with Emile de Girardin.

163. 18. LA PASTA; Giuditta Pasta (1798-1865) was one of the famous
sopranos of her day; for her Bellini wrote _La Somnambula_ and
_Norma_.

164. CHANSON DE BARBERINE. From the comedy _Barberine_ (1836).

165. CHANSON DE FORTUNIO. From _le Chandelier_ ( 1836), where it is
sung by a character named Fortunio. 25. MA MIE, instead of _m'amie_;
this is a remnant of what was the regular practice in the earliest
period of French, the use of the feminine forms, ma, ta, sa, with
elision of the vowel, before nouns beginning with a vowel; the
substitution of the masculine forms in such cases begins in the
twelfth century.

166. 167. TRISTESSE. June 14, 1840. "RAPPELLE-TOI." 1842. SOUVENIR.
February, 1841. This poem is of the same order of thought as _le Lac_
of Lamartine and the _Tristesse d'Olympia_ of Victor Hugo; see note on
the latter poem.

169. 17. DANTE, POURQUOI DIS-TU; the passage referred to is in the
_Inferno_, canto v, 1. 121 ; Francesca da Rimini (in French Francoise)
begins the short and immortal story of her love for Paolo with these
words :

        "There is no greater sorrow
    Than to be mindful of the happy time
    In misery."

170. 24. PIE, an old spelling of _pied_, used here to satisfy the
rules of rhyme. Cf. following page, 1. 26.

172.17. MA SEULE AMIE. George Sand. The latest revelations from the
correspondence of George Sand and Musset give us a more favorable view
of her part in their unhappy affair and fail to justify the terms in
which he refers to her here. See the volume of Vicomte de Spoelberch
de Lovenjoul cited among the works for reference.

174. SUR UNE MORTE. October, 1842; the lady referred to was the
Princess Belgiojoso (1808-1871), who after the unsuccessful movement
for Italian liberty in 1831 left Italy and resided in Paris, where
Musset came often to her salon, i. LA NUIT, one of the famous
allegorical statues made by Michaelangelo for the tombs of Giuliano
and Lorenzo de Medici.

175 A M. VICTOR HUGO. April. 26, 1843. CHANSON. "ADIEU, SUZON." 1844.


THEOPHILE GAUTIER.

1811-1872.

One of the most important poets of the century, though he can not be
called in any large sense one of the greatest. His importance is due
to the emphasis that he placed on the element of form both by his
precept and by his practice. The directness and sincerity of the
emotional cry are lost sight of in the pursuit of exquisite and
perfect workmanship in the representation of outward beauty. _L'Art_,
p. 190, sums up his poetic art. Later poetry has been profoundly
influenced by this doctrine. His natural gifts adapted him perfectly
to the role that he played, for, while he was without great
intellectual depth or emotional intensity, he had a rare power of
seeing the forms and colors of things.

Works: _Poesies_, 1830; _Albertus_, 1833; _la Comedie de la mort_,
1838; the preceding were republished in one volume with additions
in 1845; _Emaux et Camees_, 1852; _Poesies nouvelles_, 1863; in the
edition of his _Oeuvres completes_ the _Poesies completes_ make two
volumes, _Emaux et Camees_, one.

E, Faguet, _XIXe siecle_, 1887; Brunetiere, _Evolution de la poesie
lyrique_, vol. ii.

177. VOYAGE. From the _Poesies_ of 1830. The line of the motto from La
Fontaine is from the one-act comedy _Clymene_, line 35. Catullus 87-47
B.c.) was a Latin poet whose lyrics show intensity of feeling and rare
grace of expression. The lines here quoted are from the _Carmina_,
xlvi. The idea of the poem is quite characteristic of Gautier, who
delighted especially in the picturesque aspects of travel, as his
famous descriptions of foreign lands show (_Voyage en Espagne, Voyage
en Russie, Voyage en Italie,_ etc.).

178. 17. ENRAYE, puts on the brakes. Of the other poems of Gautier
here given all but CHOC DE CAVALIERS, LES COLOMBES, LAMENTO,
TRISTESSE, and LA CARAVANE are from _Emaux et Camees_; these five will
be found in vol. i of the _Poesies completes_ under the title _Poesies
diverses_.

188. L'AVEUGLE, i. LES PUITS DE VENISE; the dungeons of Venice are
famous.

189. LE MERLE. 18. The Arve joins the Rhone just after the latter
issues from Lake Geneva. The water of the Rhone is very clear and
blue, while that of the Arve, especially when swollen by rain and
melted snow, is muddy and grayish-yellow.

19O. 4. _mettre en demeure_, to summon by legal process.

191. L'ART, i. CARRARE, PAROS, marbles especially fine and white and
adapted for statuary, the former from Carrara, Italy, the latter from
Paros, an island in the Aegean Sea. 21. NIMBE TRILOBE; the Virgin was
often represented in early paintings with a halo of three rounded
lobes, in the shape of a trefoil, symbolizing the Trinity.


VICTOR DE LAPRADE.

1812-1883.

A poet of elevation and purity, whose worth is rather greater than his
reputation, which has been somewhat eclipsed by that of his greater
contemporaries.

Works: _Psyche_, 1840; _Odes et Poemes_, 1844; _Pointes evangeliques_,
1852; _Symphonies_, 1855; _Idylles heroiques_, 1858; _Pernette_,

MME. ACKERMANN.

1813-1890.

Louise-Victorine Choquet, who became Mme. Paul Ackermann by her
marriage in 1844 and was left a widow

in 1846, lived a life of great retirement and seclusion. Her work,
the fruit of long solitude, bears the impress of a strong, reflective
mind. It is deeply linged with pessimism.

Works: _Contes et poesies_, 1863; _Poesies philosophiques_, 1874;
collected in one volume, _Poesies_, 1877.

For reference: Comte d'Haussonville, _Mme. Ackermann, d'apres des
lettres et des papiers inedits_, 1891.


CHARLES-MARIE LECONTE DE LISLE.

1818-1894.

Born on the island of Bourbon, the tropical landscape that was
familiar to his boyhood recurs constantly in his poems. Coming to
France to complete his studies and to reside, he became the master
spirit among the poets of the middle of the century and the recognized
leader of the Parnassiens. From the beginning he protested vigorously
against the Romanticists of 1830, not only as making an immodest and
on the whole vulgar display of self (cf. _les Montreurs_, p. 199), but
also as inevitably falling short of artistic perfection because, being
possessed, or at least moved, by the emotion they were expressing,
they could not be wholly masters of the instrument of expression. To
be thus wholly master of the resources of poetic art one must be quite
untroubled by one's own personal joys and sorrows, have the brain
clear and free. This call to the poet to rid himself of the personal
element was emphasized by the reflection that individual emotions are
of little importance or interest, being dwarfed by the collective life
of humanity in general, which in turn is overshadowed by the vast
phenomenon of life as a whole, while this again is but a transient
vapor on the face of the immense universe. So the poetic creed of
an impersonal and impassive art was more or less blended with a
materialism pervaded with a buddhistic pessimism that is vexed and
wearied with the vain motions of this human world, and longs for the
rest of Nirvana; and this vexation and weariness frequently rise to a
poignant intensity. However far he may then be thought to be from the
impassive impersonality of his doctrine, there is but one opinion as
to his rare command of form and the exquisite perfection of his art,
which have won for him the epithet _impeccable_.

Works: _Poemes antiques_, 1853; _Poemes et poesies_, 1855; _Poesies
completes_, 1858 (contains the two previous collections); _Poemes
barbares_, 1862; _Poemes tragiques_, 1884; _Derniers poemes_, 1894. He
was also an industrious translator of the Greek poets and of Horace.

For reference: P. Bourget, _Nouveaux essais de psychologie
contemporaine_, 1885; J. Lemaitre, _les Contemporains_, vol. ii, 1887;
F. Brunetiere, _Evolution de la poesie lyrique_, vol. ii, 1894; also
in Contemporary Review, vol. lxvi.

199. LES MONTREURS. From _Poemes barbares_. MIDI and NOX are from the
_Poemes antiques_. The poems from L'ECCLESIASTE to REQUIES inclusive,
and also LE MANCHY, are from the _Poemes barbares_. The rest, except
the last, are from the _Poemes tragiques_.

203. LA VERANDAH, I. HUKA, oriental pipe.

215. SI L'AURORE. 10. PITONS, mountain peaks; the word is used in the
French colonies. 21. VARANGUE, a kind of porch, cf. verandah.

found in the final line of each stanza, _trois fils d'or_.


CHARLES BAUDELAIRE.

1821-1867.

His was a perverse nature, endowed with rare gifts which he
persistently abused. Pure physical sensation supplied a large part of
the material for his poetry, and among the senses it was especially
the one that has the remotest association with ideas that he drew upon
most constantly--the sense of smell. In his desperate search for new
and strange sensations he went the round of violent and exhausting
dissipations, and as his senses flagged he spurred them with all sorts
of stimulants. Meanwhile he observed himself curiously ; the result
in his poems is an impression of peculiarly wilful depravity. They
reflect his physical and mental experience, are always without
sobriety, often lacking in sanity. The title, _les Fleurs du mal_, is
both appropriate and suggestive; they invite no epithets so much as
"unhealthy" and "unwholesome."

He was extremely fond of Edgar A. Poe, and translated his works.

Works: _les Fleurs du mal_, 1857, new edition, 1861; _Oeuvres
posthumes_, 1887.

The poems given here are all from _les Fleurs du mal_.

221. 19. BOUCHER; Francois Boucher (1703-1770) was a painter of
pastoral and genre subjects.


PIERRE DUPONT.

1821-1870.

He enjoyed a moment of great popularity about 1848, paid for since by
being too much forgotten. His chansons are simple, sincere, and sweet,
breathing a delight in rural life and sympathy with the lot of the
poor. Works: Chansons, 1860; _Chansons et poesies_ is the title of the
current edition of his poems.

For reference: Sainte-Beuve, _Causeries du lundi_, vol. iv.


ANDRE LEMOYNE.

1822.


Has achieved especial success by his poetic descriptions of nature,
which proceed from a close and loving observation and a quick
responsiveness to her moods. Works: _Stella Maris.--Ecce Homo_, etc.,
1860; _les Roses d'Antan_, 1865; _les Charmeuses_, 1867; _Legendes des
Bois et Chansons marines_, 1871; _Fleurs des ruines_, 1888; _Fleurs du
soir_, 1893.

232. 12. CHANSON MARINE. CAP FREHEL, on the north coast of Brittany,
just south of the Channel Islands. 24. GRANVILLE and AVRANCHES are
small towns on the Channel coast, between St. Malo and Cherbourg. 26.
The ORNE and VIRE are small streams flowing northward into the Channel
in the same region.


THEODORE DE BANVILLE.

1823-1891.

A precocious and voluminous writer, who delighted in playing with the
technical difficulties of lyric forms. His devotion to form was his
chief excellence and gave him a considerable influence on the group of
_Parnassiens_. He was especially responsible for the revival of the
fixed forms of the older French poetry. He took up and developed the
dictum of Saint-Beuve that rhyme is "_l'unique harmonie du vers_" and
his _Odes funambulesques_ sought even to make it a main means of comic
effect. His work is deficient in substance.

Works : _Les Cariatides_, 1842; _les Stalactites_, 1846; _Odelettes_,
1856; _Odes funambulesques_, 1857; _les Exiles_, 1860; _Idylles
prussiennes_, 1871; _les Princesses_, 1874; _Sonnailles et
Clochettes_, 1890; _Dans la fournaise. Dernieres poesies_, 1892.

For reference: Sainte-Beuve, _Causeries du lundi_, vol. xiv; J.
Lemaitre, _les Contemporains_, vol. i, 1886; A. Lang, _Essays in
Little_, London, 1891.

234. LA CHANSON DE MA MIE. MA MIE, see note on 165, 25.

235. BALLADE DES PENDUS. From the comedy _Gringoire_ (1866). 20.
FLORE, the Roman goddess of fruits and flowers. 26. _du roi Louis_
; Louis XI. (1461-1487), whose measures to break down feudalism and
establish the power of the monarchy are notorious.


HENRI DE BORNIER.

1825.

Primarily a dramatic poet, he obtained one of the striking successes
of the latter half of the century by his drama _la Fille de Roland_
(1875) which, evoking memories of recent disaster and the dearest
hopes of France, deeply touched the patriotic sentiment of his
country. His lyric poems make but one volume.

Works: _Les Premieres Feuilles, 1845_; the volume _Poesiescompletes,
1881_, contains, besides the poems of the first volume, a number
that appeared at intervals, several of which received prizes from
the Academy, as _l'Isthme de Suez_, 1861, and _la France dans
l'extreme Orient_, 1863; _Poesies completes,_ new edition, 1894.


ANDRE THEURIET.

1833.

Though now best known as a novelist, he began as a poet, and it is not
certain that he will not finally be best remembered for his verse.
His eyes and his sympathies are for the woods and fields and for the
simple toilers whose lives lie close to them. He has instilled into
his poems something of the odors of the forest and of the soil.

Works: _Le Chemin des bois_, 1867 ; _les Paysans de l'Argonne, 1792._
1871; _le Bleu et le Noir_, 1873; _le Livre de la Payse_, 1882.

For reference: E. Besson, _Andre Theuriet, sa vie et ses oeuvres_,

238. LES PAYSANS. From _le Livre de la Payse._



GEORGES LAFENESTRE.

1837.

Though he is perhaps more widely known as a critic of art than as a
poet, his poems have a certain distinction by reason of their deep and
serious thought and their clear and noble expression.

Works: _Les Esperances_, 1864; _Idylles et Chansons_, 1874. The poems
here given are from _Idylles et Chansons_.

240. 21. MICHEL-ANGE, Michaelangelo.


FELIX FRANK.

1837.

He is chiefly known to the world of scholars by his studies in
literary history and his editions of writers of the Renaissance.

Works : _Chants de colere_, 1871; _le Poeme de la Jeunesse_, 1876; _la
Chanson d'amour_, 1885.

243. C'ETAIT UN VIEUX LOGIS. From _le Poeme de la Jeunesse_.


ARMAND SILVESTRE.

1838.

A prolific writer of both prose and verse. He has a rich gift of
style, but he appeals to his reader more often by the sensuous charm
of his lines than by their originality or depth.

Works: _Rimes neuves et vieilles_, 1866; _Renaissances_, 1870; _la
Gloire du souvenir_, 1872; these three volumes are collected in
_Premieres poesies_, 1875; _la Chanson des heures_,1878; _les Ailes
d'or_, 1880; _le Pays des roses_, 1882; _le Chemin des etoiles_, 1885:
_Roses d'octobre_, 1889; _l'Or des couchants_, 1892; _les Aurores
lointaines_, 1895.

245. LE PELERINAGE. From _les Ailes d'or_.


ALBERT GLATIGNY.

1839-1873.

Led a wandering and adventurous life. He was at different times actor
in a travelling company, prompter, and writer. In his poems he shows
a native gift of expression that made him a favorite of the
_Parnassiens_.

Works: _Les Vignes folles_, 1857; _les fleches d'or_, 1864; _Gilles et
Pasquins_, 1872.

For reference: J. Lazare, _A. Glatigny, sa vie, son oeuvre_; Catulle
Mendes, _Legende du Parnasse contemporain_, 1884.


SULLY PRUDHOMME.

1839.

Rene-Francois-Armand Prudhomme, known as Sully Prudhomme, combines the
artistic punctiliousness of a _Parnassien_ with sincere emotion and
a deeply philosophic mind. The intellectual quality of his work is
conspicuous, but hardly less so the grace and finish of its form. It
bears deep traces of the influence of the scientific movement of our
time and of the transformation it has wrought in our ideas of man and
nature and their relations. The personal emotion from which his lyrics
spring appears always intellectually illumined, with its background of
scientific corollaries and logical consequences. It is not abandoned
to itself, to wreak itself on expression, but is checked by the
challenge of doubt or scientific curiosity or moral scruple. His
verse thus unites in rare degree the qualities of lyrical impulse and
philosophical reflection.

Works: _Stances et Poemes_, 1865; _les Epreuves_, 1866; _les
Solitudes_, 1869; _les Destins_, 1872; _les Vaines Tendresses_, 1875;
_la Justice_, 1878; _le Prisme_, 1886; _le Bonheur_, 1888; these have
appeared in a new edition as _Oeuvres_, 5 vols., 1883-1888.

For reference: J. Lemaitre, _les Contemporains_, vol. i, 1886; E.
Caro, _Poetes et romanciers_, 1888; G. Paris, _Penseurs et poetes_,
1896; F. Brunetiere, _Evolution de la poesie lyrique_, vol. ii, 1894.

The first eleven poems are from _Stances et Poemes_. LES DANAIDES, UN
SONGE and LE RENDEZ VOUS are from _les Epreuves_; LA VOIE LACTEE
is from _les Solitudes_; REPENTIR, from _Impressions de la Guerre_
(1872;) CE QUI DURE, LES INFIDELES, LES AMOURS TERRESTRES and
L'ALPHABET, from _les Vaines Tendresses_; and the last two sonnets,
from _la Justice_.

255. LE LEVER DU SOLEIL. 5. _Hellade_, Hellas, country inhabited
by the Hellenes, or Greeks, a name at first given to a district of
Thessaly, later to all Greece.

257. LES DANAIDES. The Danaides were the fifty daughters of Danaus,
twin-brother of Aegyptus, whose fifty sons they married and then
murdered. As a punishment they were condemned to pour water forever
into a sieve. 2. _Theano_, _Callidie_, _Amymone_, _Agave_ are names of
four of the daughters.


ALPHONSE DAUDET.

1840-1897.

Though of world-wide fame as a brilliant novelist, he introduced
himself to the public by a volume of verse, _les Amoureuses_, which
contains many poems delicate in sentiment and exquisite in style.


HENRI CAZALIS (JEAN LAHOR).

1840.

The poems of Henri Cazalis, who has preferred to give his later works
to the public under the nom de plume Jean Lahor, have the grave
pessimism of Leconte de Lisle, but with more of buddhistic
resignation. They are often sustained by a high moral fortitude, and
though they are clothed in a less rich and brilliant garment than
the poems of Leconte de Lisle, they have a charm of their own,
"_inquietant et penetrant_," says Paul Bourget, "_comme celui des
tableaux de Burne Jones et de la musique tzigane, des romans de
Tolstoi et des_ lieder _de Heine_."

Works: _Vita tristis_, 1865 (under the pseudonym Jean Caselli;)
_Melancholia_, 1866; _le Livre du neant_, 1872; _l'Illusion_, 1875;
the preceding were collected in one volume and published under the
name Jean Lahor and with the title _l'Illusion_, 1888; under the
same name, _le Cantique des cantiques_, a translation of the Song of
Solomon, 1885; _les Quatrains d'Al-Ghazali_, 1896.

1841.

He holds an honorable place among the _poetae minores_ by poems
distinguished for the sincerity and simple truth of their record of
nature and humble experience.

Works: _Floreal_, 1870; _Vieux Airs et Jeunes Chansons_. 1884;
_Bouquet d'automne_, 1890.


FRANCOIS COPPEE.

1842.

He is especially the poet of the _vie des humbles_. His talent is not
pre-eminently lyric, and he has tended to escape

from the lyric domain in different directions, into the narrative
poem, the drama, and the novel, in each of which he has achieved
success. He is probably the most popular living French poet.

Works: _Le Reliquaire_, 1866; _Intimites_, 1868; _Poemes modernes_,
1869; _les Humbles_, 1872; _Promenades et interieurs_, 1872; _le
Cahier rouge_, 1874; _Olivier_, 1875; _l'Exilee_, 1876; _les Mois_,
1877; _Contes en vers et poesies diverses_, 1881 and 1887;

_Poemes et recits_, 1886; _Arriere-saison_, 1887; _les Paroles
sinceres_, 1890; _Oeuvres_, 5 vols., 1885-91.

271. JUIN. From _les Mois_.

272. L'HOROSCOPE. From _le Reliquaire_.

273. L'ATTENTE. From _Poemes modernes_.

275. CHANSON D'EXIL, "QUAND VOUS ME MONTREZ UNE ROSE," LIED and
ETOILES FILANTES are from _l'Exilee_.

277. A UN ELEGIAQUE. From _Contes en vers et poesies diverses_. The
story of the Spartan boy and the fox may be found in Plutarch's
Lycurgus, 18. The idea should be compared with the artistic doctrine
of the _impassibles_.


JOSE-MARIA DE HEREDIA.

l842.

He was born in Cuba, but was educated and has resided in France. He
attracted notice among the _Parnassiens_ by the degree of perfection
with which he rendered in words the element of plastic beauty and the
rare finish and precision of his style. He has used almost exclusively
the form of the sonnet, to which he has given a new power and
amplitude.

Works: _Les Trophies_, 1893 (many of the sonnets composing this volume
had appeared in the _Revue des Deux Mondes_ and elsewhwere and had
long been admired).

For reference: J. Lemaitre, _les Contemorains_, vol. ii, 1887; F.
Brunetiere, _Evolution de la poesie lyrique_, vol. ii, 1894; M. de
Voguee, _Devant le siecle_, 1896; Edmund Gosse, _Critical Kit-Kats_,
New York, 1896.

278. ANTOINE ET CLEOPATRE. LE CYDNUS. This is the name of the river on
which Tarsus is situated. 18. LAGIDE; the line of the Ptolemies, to
which Cleopatra belonged, was descended from Lagus; the first Ptolemy
was commonly called the son of Lagus.

279. 18. BUBASTE ET SAIS; Bubastis and Sais were ancient cities of
importance in the Delta of the Nile.

280. 6. LES CONQUERANTS. PALOS, the famous Spanish port from which
Columbus sailed. MOGUER, a small town a little above Palos. 9.
CIPANGO, the name given by Marco Polo in the account of his travels to
an island or islands east of Asia, supposed to be Japan.


PAUL VERLAINE.

1844-1896.

The most striking and original figure among the poets of the latter
half of the century. In the irregularity of his life he might count
as a modern Rutebeuf or Villon. He certainly possessed a rich poetic
endowment, which only occasionally produced what it seemed capable
of. He began under the influence of the _Parnassiens_, but his most
characteristic work is as far removed as possible from the plastic
objectivity of that school. He pursues the expression of the most
elusive sensations, and is so little concerned about clear ideas and
precise forms and outlines that even grammatical coherence often
fails, and the mind gropes in a mist of unintelligibility--in which
direction, however, his disciples have gone very far beyond him. But
in the rendering of pure feeling and sensation, in direct emotional
appeal of tone and accent, he discovered powerful secrets for his
verse that others have not known. He seems now to have been one of the
original poetic forces of the century.

Works: _Poemes saturniens_, 1866; _Fetes galantes_, 1869; _la Bonne
Chanson_, 1870; _Romances sans paroles_, 1874; _Sagesse_, 1881; _Jadis
et naguere_, 1885; _Amour_, 1888; _Parallelement_, 1889; _Bonheur_,
1891; _Chansons pour elle_, 1891; _Dans les limbes_, 1894; _Chair_,
1896; _Invectives_, 1896; selections from the volumes to and including
_Bonheur_ are given in _Choix de poesies_, 1891.

For reference: Ch. Morice, _Paul Verlaine, l'homme et l'oeuvre_; J.
Lemaitre, in _Revue Bleue_, Jan. 7, 1888; F. Brunetiere, _Evolution de
la poesie Iyrique_, vol. ii, 1894; A. Cohn, in _The Bookman_, vol. i,
with portraits.

28O. COLLOQUE SENTIMENTAL. From _Fetes galantes_.

288. 1. The quotation is from Dante's _Purgatorio_, canto iii, 79-84.
ART POETIQUE. From _Jadis et naguere_.

289. UN VEUF PARLE and PARABOLES are from _Amour_.

291. PARABOLES. 1. LE POISSON; the use of the fish in Christian art as
a symbol of Christ is well known. Its origin is commonly said to be in
the initials of the Greek [Greek: Iaesus Christos Theou Tios Sotaer]
which make the word _Ichthus_ (fish). 2. L'ANON; cf. St. Mark xi. 3.
LES PORCS, etc.; cf. St. Mark v, 13.


EMILE BERGERAT.

1845.

Widely known under the name of Caliban as the alert and witty
_chroniqueur_ of the Figaro and as the facile rhymester of its _lyre
comique_, has written a few serious poems of direct and vigorous
expression, especially under the inspiration of the memory of the war
of 1870-71.

Works: _Poemes de la guerre_, 1871; _la Lyre comique_, 1889.

291. PAROLES DOREES. 17. CYLINDRE, the cylinder or toothed roller of
the hand-organ.


FRANCOIS FABIE.

1846.

The son of poor peasants, he has perpetuated the scenes and the simple
life of his boyhood and the poverty and rude toil of his country home
in verse of deep, pure, and tender feeling.

Works: _La Poesie des Betes_, 1886; _le Clocher_, 1887; _la Bonne
terre_, 1889; _Voix rustiques_, 1892; these are collected in the
edition of _Poesies_, 2 vols., 1891-94. 293. LES GENETS. From _le
Clocher_.


PAUL DEROULEDE.

1846.

Politician, as well as man of letters, he is known especially for
his war lyrics, which have achieved a wide popularity. They are
recommended more by the vigor of their patriotic sentiment than by
their technical qualities.

Works: _Chants du Soldat_, 1872; _Nouveaux Chants du Soldat_, 1875;
Marches et Sonneries, 1881; _Refrains militaires_, 1888; _Chants du
Paysan_, 1894.

For reference: G. Larroumet, _Etudes de litterature et d'art_ vol.
iii.

296. LE BON GITE. From _Nouveaux Chants du Soldat_.


GEORGES BOUTELLEAU.

1846.

He has won the attention of the smaller public of men of letters by
the finish and delicacy of the short poems, which justify the titles
of the volumes in which they have been collected by suggesting the art
of the miniature painter and the worker in stained glass.

Works: _Poemes en miniature_, 1881; _le Vitrail_, 1887; _les

Cimes_, 1893.

297. LE COLIBRI. From _Poemes en miniature_.

298. LES DEUX OMBRES. From _le Vitrail_.


LOUIS TIERCELIN.

1849.

His work is distinguished by sentiment that is usually pure and sweet,
sometimes deep and tender.

Works: _Les Asphodeles_, 1873; _l'Oasis_, 1880; _les Anniversaires_,
1887; _les Cloches_, 1891; _Sur la Harpe_, 1897.

298. LE PETIT ENFANT. From _l'Oasis_. For the form of the triolet see
the remarks on versification.


GUY DE MAUPASSANT.

1850-1893.

This famous master of the short story began his literary career, like
Daudet, Theuriet, and Bourget, with a volume of verse. _Des Vers_,
1880.


PAUL BOURGET.

1852.

Like Maupassant, he early forsook poetry for the novel, and for
literary criticism. His verse, like his prose, is the work of a
psychologist, who observes and analyzes his own experiences. He is
never so far possessed by his emotion as to cease to inspect it
curiously. In the restlessness of his spirit, the unsettled currents
of his moral atmosphere, his doubts and longings, he represents a
large fraction of his generation.

Works: _La Vie inquiete_, 1874; _Edel_, 1878; _les Aveux_, 1882;
collected in two volumes with the title _Poesies_, 1885-87.

For reference: J. Lemaitre, _les Contemporains_, vol. ii, 1887; A. N.
van Daell, _Extraits choisis des oeuvres de Paul Bourget_, Boston,
1894 (introduction and _lettre autobiographique_).

302. PRAETERITA is from _la Vie inquiete_; the other poems here given
are from _les Aveux_. 13, 14; the second of November, _jour des
Trepasses_, is in the church calendar the day of the special
commemoration of the dead.


ABEL HERMANT.

1862.

Another who seems to have been won from poetry to the novel, in which
field he has achieved some striking successes. His one volume of
verse is _les Mepris_, 1883. See G. Pellissier, _Nouveaux essais de
litterature contemporaine_, 1895.

305. L'ETOILE. 17. LE CHALDEEN; see St. Matthew ii, i-ii.

INDEX OF FIRST LINES

Accoude sur le bastingage.
Adieu! mot qu'une larme humecte sur la levre.
Adieu, patrie.
Adieu, Suzon, ma rose blonde.
Ainsi, toujours pousses vers de nouveaux rivages.
A la tres chere, a la tres belle.
Allons, enfants de la patrie.
Amour a la fermiere! elle est.
Apres vingt ans d'exil, de cet exil impie.
A quoi bon entendre.
Au bon vieulx temps un train d'amour regnait.
Au bout du vieux canal plein de mats, juste en face.
Au tintement de l'eau dans les porphyres roux.
Au travers de la vitre blanche.
Aux etoiles j'ai dit un soir.
A vous, trouppe legere.
Avril est de retour.

Beau chevalier qui partez pour la guerre.
Bel aubespin verdissant.
Berger, tu dis que notre etoile.
Bleus ou noirs, tous aimes, tous beaux.
Bonne vieille, que fais-tu la.

Ce livre est toute ma jeunesse.
C'est la mort qui console, helas! et qui fait vivre.
C'est la saison des avalanches.
C'est le moment crepusculaire.
C'etait un vieux logis, dans une etroite rue.
Combien j'ai douce souvenance.
Comme un agonisant cache, les levres blanches.
Comme un marin hardi que la cloche aux flancs lourds.
Comme un morne exile, loin de ceux que j'aimais.
Comme un vol de gerfauts hors du charnier natal.
Courage, o faible enfant de qui ma solitude.
Couronnes de thym et de marjolaine.

Dans cette vie ou nous ne sommes.
Dans l'alcove sombre.
Dans le ciel clair raye par l'hirondelle alerte.
Dans les nuits d'automne, errant par la ville.
Dans le vieux parc solitaire et glace.
Dans l'interminable.De la depouille de nos bois.
De la musique avant toute chose.
Demain, des l'aube, a l'heure ou blanchit la campagne.
De ta tige detachee.
Deux ombres cheminaient dans une etroite allee.
Deux voix s'elevent tour a tour.
Dictes-moy ou, n'en quel pays.
Dieu fait triompher l'innocence.
Dieu ! qu'il la fait bon regarder.
Dieu vous gard, messagers fidelles.
Du temps que j'etais ecolier.

Ecoutez la chanson bien douce.
Elle etait belle, si la nuit.
Elle etait bien jolie, au matin, sans atours.
Enfants de la folie.
Enfants d'un jour, o nouveau-nes.
Escoute, bucheron, arreste un peu le bras.
Et j'ai dit dans mon coeur: "Que faire de la vie."

Fortune dont la main couronne.

Gloire au coeur temeraire epris de l'impossible.

He quoi! j'entends que l'on critique.
Heureux qui, comme Ulysse, a fait un beau voyage.
Hier il m'a semble (sans doute j'etais ivre).
Homme, libre penseur! te crois-tu seul pensant.
Homme libre, toujours tu cheriras la mer.

Ici-bas tous les lilas meurent.
Il est amer et doux, pendant les nuits d'hiver.
Il est tard; l'astronome aux veilles obstinees.
Il est un air pour qui je donnerais.
Il etait un roi d'Yvetot.
Il faut, dans ce bas monde, aimer beaucoup de choses.
Il faut, voyez-vous, nous pardonner les choses.
Il git au fond de quelque armoire.
Il jouait, le petit enfant.
Il pleure dans mon coeur.
Ils s'en vont, ces rois de ma vie.
Ils vont pieds nus le plus souvent. L'hiver.

J'ai bien assez vecu, puisque dans mes douleurs.
J'ai bon coeur, je ne veux a nul etre aucun mal.
J'ai dans mon coeur un oiseau bleu.
J'ai deux grands boeufs dans mon etable.
J'ai longtemps habite sous de vastes portiques.
J'aimais froidement ma patrie.
J'aime le son du cor, le soir, au fond des bois.
J'ai perdu ma force et ma vie.
J'ai plus de souvenirs que si j'avais mille ans.
J'ai repose mon coeur avec tranquillite.
J'ai revele mon coeur au Dieu de l'innocence.
J'ai voulu ce matin te rapporter des roses.
J'ai voulu tout aimer, et je suis malheureux.
J'ai vu passer aux pays froids.
Jamais ne pourray-je bannir.
Je congnois bien mouches en laict.
Je ne devais pas vous le dire.
Je ne sais pourquoi.
J'entrais dans mes seize ans, leger de corps et d'ame.
Je sens un monde en moi de confuses pensees.
J'esperais bien pleurer, mais je croyais souffrir.
Je suis le Chaldeen par l'etoile conduit.
Je t'aime, en attendant mon eternelle epouse.
J'etais enfant. J'aimais les grands combats.
J'etais seul pres des flots, par une nuit d'etoiles.
Jete par le hasard sur un vieux globe infime.
Jeune homme, qui me viens lire tes plaintes vaines.
Jeune homme sans melancolie.
Je viens de faire un grand voyage.
Je vois un groupe sur la mer.

La-bas, sous les arbres, s'abrite.
La-bas, sur la mer, comme l'hirondelle.
La caravane humaine au Sahara du monde.
Laissez-moy penser a mon aise.
La lune blanche.
La lune est grande, le ciel clair.
L'apre rugissement de la mer pleine d'ombre.
La tombe dit a la rose.
L'aube nait et ta porte est close.
La victoire en chantant nous ouvre la barriere.
L'eau dans les grands lacs bleus.
L'ecclesiaste a dit : Un chien vivant vaut mieux.
Le choc avait ete tres rude. Les tribuns.
Le ciel est noir, la terre est blanche.
Le ciel est, par-dessus le toit.
Le fantome est venu de la trentieme annee.
Le frais matin dorait de sa clarte premiere.
Le grand soleil, plonge dans un royal ennui.
Le jour tombait, une pale nuee.
Le laboureur m'a dit en songe: "Fais ton pain."
L'epi naissant murit de la faux respecte.
Le present se fait vide et triste.
Le sable rouge est comme une mer sans limites.
Les champs n'etaient pas noirs, les cieux n'etaient pas mornes.
Les cieux inexorables.
Les deux soeurs etaient la, les bras entrelaces.
Les fourriers d'Este sont venus.
Les genets, doucement balances par la brise.
Le soir ramene le silence.
L'esprit calme des dieux habite dans les plantes.
L'ete, lorsque le jour a fui, de fleurs couvert.
Le temps a laissie son manteau.
Le vase ou meurt cette vervaine.
Le village s'eveille a la corne du patre.
L'homme a, pour payer sa rancon.
L'oiseleur Amour se promene.
Lorsque l'enfant parait, le cercle de famille.

Ma belle amie est morte.
Marchez! l'humanite ne vit pas d'une idee.
Mes volages humeurs, plus sterilles que belles
Midi, roi des etes, epandu sur la plaine.
Mieux que l'aigle chasseur, familier de la nue.
Mignonne, allons voir si la rose.
Mon ame a son secret, ma vie a son mystere.
Mon coeur, lasse de tout, meme de l'esperance.
Monte, ecureuil, monte au grand chene.
Morne esprit, autrefois amoureux de la lutte.
Mort, j'appelle de ta rigueur.
Murs, ville.

N'esperons plus, mon ame, aux promesses du monde.
Non, tu n'entendras pas, de ta levre trop fiere.
Nos yeux se sont croises et nous nous sommes plu.
Nous, dont la lampe, le matin.
Nous prosperons!  Qu'importe aux anciens malheureux.
Nous revenions d'un long voyage.
Nouvelles ont couru en France.
Novembre approche,--et c'est le mois charmant.

O combien de marins, combien de capitaines.
O Corse a cheveux plats! que la France etait belle.
O France, quoique tu sommeilles.
Oh! tant qu'on le verra troner, ce gueux, ce prince.
On parlera de sa gloire.
O nuit, o douce nuit d'ete, qui viens a nous.
O pere qu'adore mon pere.
O souvenirs! printemps! aurore!
Oui, l'oeuvre sort plus belle.
O vallons paternels; doux champs; humble chaumiere.

Par la chaine d'or des etoiles vives.
Plaintive tourterelle.
Poete, prends ton luth et me donne un baiser.
Pour boire dessus l'herbe tendre.
Pourquoi cet amour insense.
Pour soulever un poids si lourd.
Proscrit, regarde les roses.
Puisqu'ici-has toute ame.
Puisque l'aube grandit, puisque voici l'aurore.

Quand au mouton belant la sombre boucherie.
Quand je suis vingt ou trente mois.
Quand les chenes, a chaque branche.
Quand le soleil se couche horizontal.
Quand nous habitions tous ensemble.
Quand un grand fleuve a fait trois ou quatre cents lieues.
Quand vous me montrez une rose.
Quand vous serez bien vieille, au soir, a la chandelle.
Que diras-tu ce soir, pauvre ame solitaire.
Que j'aime a voir dans la vallee.
Que le soleil est beau quand tout frais il se leve.
Qu'es-tu, passant? le bois est sombre.
Qui donc t'a pu creer, Sphinx etrange, o Nature!
Qui peut dire: Mes yeux ont oublie l'aurore?

Rappelle-toi, quand l'Aurore craintive.
Rougissante et tete baissee.

Salut, bois couronnes d'un reste de verdure.
Sans doute il est trop tard pour parler encor d'elle.
Si je pouvais voir, o patrie.
Si l'Aurore, toujours, de ses perles arrose.
S'il avait su quelle ame il a blessee.
S'il est un buisson quelque part.
S'il est un charmant gazon.
Si nostre vie est moins qu'une journee.
Si vous croyez que je vais dire.
Si vous n'avez rien a me dire.
Sois-moi fidele, o pauvre habit que j'aime.
Son age echappait a l'enfance.
Sous l'azur triomphal, au soleil qui flamboie.
Sous un nuage frais de claire mousseline.
Souvent sur la montagne, a l'ombre du vieux chene.
Soyez beni, Seigneur, qui m'avez fait chretien.
Sur la pente des monts les brises apaisees.
Sur la plage sonore ou la mer de Sorrente.
Sur le coteau, la-bas ou sont les tombes.
Sur ses larges bras etendus.

Ta douleur, du Perier, sera donc eternelle.
Tandis qu'a leurs oeuvres perverses.
Tel qu'un morne animal, meurtri, plein de poussiere.
Tels que la haute mer contre les durs rivages.
Temps futurs! visions sublimes!
Te voila fort et grand garcon.
Toi que j'ai recueilli sur sa bouche expirante.
Toi qui peux monter solitaire.
Tombez, o perles denouees.
Tous deux, ils regardaient, de la haute terrasse.
Toutes, portant l'amphore, une main sur la hanche.
Tout pres du lac filtre une source.
Triste exile, qu'il te souvienne.
Tu veux toi-meme ouvrir ta tombe.

Un aveugle au coin d'une borne.
Un grand sommeil noir.
Un hymne harmonieux sort des feuilles du tremble.
Un oiseau siffle dans les branches.
Un tourbillon d'ecume, au centre de la baie.

Vieux soldats de plomb que nous sommes.
Voici qu'avril est de retour.
Vous souvient-il de cette jeune amie.
Vous voila, vous voila, pauvres bonnes pensees.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
