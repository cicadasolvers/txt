PREFACE.

The first idea of this Work arose from the occasional use of Mr. Damon's
'Catalogue of the Shells of Great Britain and Ireland,' named after the
'History of British Mollusca,' etc. Here was, on one side, a very useful
list of names, without figures or references to guide an inquirer to the
species; and on the other, a very large and splendid Work, placed by its
heavy price beyond the reach of Naturalists in general. There was nothing
between the two; nothing within reach that would assist collectors of
British Shells to name their acquisitions from ocean, beach, river, pond,
or hedgerow. A public want seemed here to be discovered. It was thought
that a list like the above, with a coloured drawing of every species, if
produced at an available price, would supply that want. At first no more
than this was thought of, but afterwards, as the preparations advanced,
various suggestions were made tending to some extension of the plan. The
results are here presented.

About 700 Figures in the Plates represent all the recognized species. They
amount to 600, being 60 more than are admitted in the latest monograph. The
greater part of these are either new or newly introduced as British. The
rest are raised from varieties to species.

As the nomenclature used by Messrs. Forbes and Hanley in their great Work
will be most generally adopted in this country, it is followed here with
very few alterations; and the synonyms given (in italics) are selected from
those which are most familiar and likely to be met with.

Some information is added respecting habits and localities, range of depth
of marine species, and comparative abundance. The letters C., Cc., Mc., R.,
Rr., and Mr., signifying 'common,' 'extremely common,' 'moderately common,'
'rare,' etc., must be taken with great caution, especially the latter, as
subject to continual change.

A list is given of British Fossil Shells identical with now living species.

A familiar description of British Mollusca and some peculiarities in their
families and genera will, it is hoped, form a useful and suitable
introduction to the names and figures. The Author's best thanks are due to
his friends, Madame De Burgh, who has collected many beautiful shells; R.
McAndrew, Esq., F.L.S., whose dredging experiences are so extensive; J. G.
Jeffreys, Esq., F.R.S., etc., whose researches have resulted in so many
additions to our Fauna; Mr. Brice Wright, the Naturalist, of Great Russell
Street, and others, who have in the most liberal manner supplied him with
specimens from which his drawings are taken. The loan of delicate and
minute shells to authors and artists has so often proved disastrous, that
nothing but a generous friendship, and a zealous love of Natural History,
could have induced proprietors so freely to incur the risk.

INTRODUCTION

TO

SHELL-BEARING BRITISH MOLLUSCA.

A common garden Snail, observed crawling and feeding, is easily seen to
possess a distinct head, upon which are four feelers or horns, with eyes at
the end, and underneath which is a mouth; a broad disc, extending the whole
length of the body, is the organ of locomotion; a spiral or coiled shell
surmounts the whole.

If, on the other hand, an Oyster be opened, no distinct head, or place for
eyes or mouth, can be seen, but only a seeming mass of pulp, with a round
gristle in the centre (the muscle of attachment), the former enclosed in a
soft skin with a double fringe round the edge (mantle), placed within a
shell composed of two pieces.

All Mollusca are more or less completely represented by these two. The
Snail and its class are named _Gasteropoda_ (abdomen-creeping), and their
shells _Univalves_; the Oyster and its class, _Acephala_ (headless), and
their shells _Bivalves_. We begin with the latter class at--

PLATE I.

_Pholadidae_, or "Borers," 1-13, have the power of piercing and inhabiting
holes in submarine wood, rocks, and stones. The hinder part of the body is
lengthened out in the form of a double tube, with openings for the ingress
and egress of fluids. _Teredo_, 1-6, has short valves, two pallets fixed at
the sides of the siphons, and lines its hole with a shelly tube. _Pholas_
and _Pholadidea_, 8-13, have long valves and sometimes accessory plates.
The shell of _Xylophaga_, 7, is like that of _Teredo_, but the animal has
neither pallets nor tube.

_Gastrochaena_, 14, has a gaping shell, and encloses itself in a
bottle-shaped covering of cemented stones and sand. _Saxicava_, 15, 16,
_Venerupis_, 18, and _Petricola_, 17, burrow in sand, or live in holes of
rocks.

_Myadae_, or "Gapers," _Mya_, 19, 20, and _Panopaea_, 21, 21*, burrow
downwards in sand and mud, their siphons protected by a coriaceous
covering. Their shells are not closed all round, and those of _Mya_ have a
spoon-shaped process in the hinge of one valve.

_Corbulidae_, 22-28, have short siphons with fringed edges, and the foot
protrudes through a hole in the otherwise closed mantle.

PLATE II.

_Poromya_, 1, 1*, and the beautiful pearly _Pandora_, 2, 3, might be
included in the family of _Corbulidae_. _Lyonsia_, 4, and _Thracia_, 5-10,
represent the _Anatinidae_. 11-18 are _Solenidae_, or "Razor-shells." Solens
burrow in deep holes in the sand, where they remain in a perpendicular
position at a great depth below the surface, where yet their presence may
be traced by the opening left. Their large muscular foot enables them to
take great leaps when out of the holes.

PLATE III.

_Psammobia_, 1-4, and _Tellina_, 5-16, include some of our most beautiful
shells. The animals have a large, fleshy, curved foot, and the mantle open
and fringed. Their shells are provided with an external ligament, and teeth
on the hinge. _Donax_, or "Wedge," 19, 20, has long, separated, fringed
siphons. Besides the small external ligament, properly so called, the
_Mactridae_ have a triangular pit in the hinge of their shell, containing an
elastic substance or spring, designed to resist the action of the adductor
muscles. _Mactra_, 21-26, ends the Plate.

PLATE IV.

_Lutraria_, 1-3, is another genus of _Mactridae_. The _Veneridae_, 4-16 and
23, or "Venus" tribe, differ from it in not having the spring-holding pit.
_Artemis_, 10, 11, is known by a large angular bend in the pallial
impression; and _Cytherea_, 23, is distinguished from Venus by one tooth on
the hinge standing out a little way from the central ones. _Astarte_,
17-22, belongs to the _Cyprinidae_.

PLATE V.

Fig. 1-3 also represent genera of _Cyprinidae_. They have no bend in the
palleal impression. _Cardium_, or "Cockle," 4-13, presents a peculiarity in
the foot, which is large and bent, and enables the animal to leap in a very
lively manner. The family of _Lucinidae_ occupy the remaining figures.
_Lucina_ has a curious tongue-shaped doubling of the pallial impression.

PLATE VI.

The _Kelliadae_, 1-15, are marine, while the _Cycladidae_, completing the
Plate, are fresh-water bivalves, and may be found in many ponds and rivers.

PLATE VII.

Of the _Unionidae_, or "Fresh-water Mussels," _Unio_, 1-3, has teeth on the
hinge, and _Anodon_, 4, has not: it is a thin shell. The foot of these
molluscs is very large, and is used in cutting the animal's way through the
mud in which it burrows. Of the marine, or true Mussels, _Modiola_, 6-9,
and _Crenella_, 12-17, have a portion of the shell reaching beyond the
point or apex, which in _Mytilus_ is terminal, 18-21. _Dreissina_, 5, is
shaped like _Mytilus_, but lives in fresh-water docks. The _Mytilidae_
attach themselves by means of horny threads spun from the foot, and called
a "byssus."

PLATE VIII.

Shells of _Arcadae_, 1-14, have the hinge characterized by a series of teeth
on each side of the apex. _Nucula_, _Arca_, and _Pectunculus_ are easily
distinguished. _Limopsis_, 14, has a spring pit between the two rows. Our
figure of _Pinna_, 16, is from a young specimen: it grows to great size,
and spins a very silky byssus. The shell of _Anomia_, 18, is fixed to
rocks, etc., by means of a bony button passing through a hole or sinus in
the lower valve. _Lima_, 22-24, has a light, thin shell, and its mantle is
adorned with beautiful fringes. It swims rapidly through the water by the
opening and shutting of its valves, and also has the habit, in seasons of
rest, of protecting itself by a network or vest of marine fragments strung
together by its byssal threads.

PLATE IX.

Contains the shells of our Pectens, or Scallops, 1-16. The animals swim
like _Lima_, as above, and also spin a byssus.

The class _Brachiopoda_, 17-24, so named because what seem to be organs of
locomotion consist of a pair of coiled, ciliated arms, ends the list of
Headless Molluscs and their bivalve shells.

PLATE X.

Class _Pteropoda_, 1-4, contains minute Mollusca, with glassy shells
variously formed, and wing-like expansions for swimming.

_Chiton_, 5-17, or "Coat of Mail," which may often be seen incrusting
rocks, commences the _Gasteropoda_; although seemingly fixed, they are
capable of locomotion, using the whole of the oval disc, which may be seen
on turning them over, for the purpose. The same may be said of the "Limpet"
tribe, _Patella_, 1-22.

PLATE XI.

This Plate commences with other forms of the Limpet tribe, _Fissurella_, 1,
2, with a hole at the top; _Puncturella_, 3, with a fissure near the top;
and _Emarginula_, 4-6, with a slit at the margin. _Haliotis_, 7, or pearly
"Ear-shell," leads to the _Trochidae_, or "Tops," 8-27.

PLATE XII.

_Ianthina_, 1-4, is genus of oceanic molluscs, which are provided with a
beautiful floating apparatus, on which the female carries her egg-bags.

_Neritina_, 5, and the _Paludinidae_, 8-11, live in fresh-water. The animal
of _Paludina_ is sprinkled all over with bright, golden specks. The
_Littorinae_, or "Winkles," 12-24, are marine, and frequent the shore among
seaweeds. _Lacuna_, 25-32, belongs to the same family.

PLATE XIII., XIV.

Are small genera, various in their characters and habits, but reasonably
included in the last family, _Littorinidae_.

PLATE XV.

The animals of _Turritella_, 1-3, and _Caecum_, 6, 7, are not unlike,
although the shells are so different; eyes at the base of the tentacles, a
short foot, and horny operculum. The somewhat similar animal of
_Aporrhais_, 4, 5, is brilliantly coloured with gold and red. _Cerithium_,
8-10, differs from _Cerithiopsis_, 11-15, more in regard to the animal than
the shell; the latter animal has a retractile proboscis, and its operculum
is not spiral.

PLATE XVI.

_Chemnitzia_, 1-11, and _Truncatella_, 12, together with _Stylifer_,
_Eulima_, and _Odostomia_, form the family of _Pyramidellidae_.
Notwithstanding the difference in the shells, the animals are very similar,
having a retractile proboscis, and eyes immersed at the base of their
tentacles.

The animal of _Natica_, 13-19, has a lobe on the upper part of the foot,
reflected over the shell in front, and another lobe behind. The shells of
_Laminaria_, 23, 24, are completely enveloped in similar lobes.

PLATE XVII.

The shells of _Odostomia_ are known by a fold in the inner lip of the
aperture.

PLATE XVIII.

Two _Tritons_, 1, 2, are admitted for the first time as British, on what we
consider fair evidence, although only two or three specimens have been
taken off Guernsey. One of _T. nodiferus_ was incrusted by a truly British
_Lepralia_. _Murex_, 3, is now familiar as an aquarian, as well as
_Purpura_, 5. A milky secretion found in the head turns purple when
exposed, and gives the celebrated purple dye. _Buccinum_, 7-13, includes
the common "Whelk," 8. _Fusus Berniciensis_, 14, is among the rarest and
most beautiful of our British shells.

PLATE XIX.

_Nassa reticulata_, 3, is a favourite inhabitant of the tank; it burrows in
search of food among the pebbles, elevating its siphon above the surface.
_Mangelia_, 4-26, has a similar long siphon. The shell of _Erato_, 27, is
wrapped in the lobes of the animal's mantle, as is also that of _Cyprea_,
28, the latter presenting a beautiful object.

PLATE XX.

After _Tornatella_, 1, and _Ovula_, 2, 3, come _Bullidae_, 4-27, including
several genera differing remarkably in the shape and disposition of the
lobes of their mantles, which in some instances, as in _Philine_, 20-25,
cover the shell. The stomach of _Scapander_, 26, 27, is a remarkable kind
of mill, composed of two bones, between which the food is ground. The
shells of _Aplysia_, 28, and _Pleurotranchus_, 29, 30, are quite internal.
_Spirula_, 31, belonging to the Cephalopodous or Cuttlefish tribe, is only
introduced doubtfully, as there is no proof of the species living in our
seas.

PLATE XXI., XXII., XXIII., XXIV.

These are occupied by shells of _Gasteropoda pulmonifera_, so named because
they breathe air by a pulmonary cavity, instead of water by gills. The
_Limnaeadae_, or fresh-water Snails, contained in Plate I., live in water,
but breathe by exposing the pulmonary cavity to air at the surface.
_Succinea_, Plate XXII., 1-3, lives by the sides of streams, sometimes
immersed. _Conovulus_, 4-7, affects brackish marshes. Our common Slugs
yield, on dissection, thin shells, which are concealed beneath the mantle,
_Limax_, 9-12. The shells of _Testacellus_, 13, 14, are fixed near the end
of the foot, outside. The glassy shells of _Vitrina_, 15, 16, do not
enclose the whole Slug-like animal. The other genera of Land Snails have
shells large enough to receive the animal when retracted and withdrawn for
repose.

NEW PROPOSED WORK, BY G. B. SOWERBY, F.L.S.

GENERIC FORMS OF SHELLS ILLUSTRATED.

The Author has long been engaged collecting materials for this Work, which
is to contain a harmonization of existing systems, in which a balance will
be struck between a too negligent and too minute subdivision. Comparative
susceptibility of _definition_ will be the guiding principle in deciding
the claims of certain groups to generic separation. The illustrations will
be copious and of full size, embracing every marked form, whether recent or
fossil, and whether adopted as a genus or not. The price is not yet fixed,
but is expected to be about L3 3s. To appear between March and May, 1866.

G. B. S., jun., will be glad to receive the names and addresses of those
who desire to see the Work when published.

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
