The designer of this bulletin first had in mind something of the sort
for the use of his students, not only the undergraduates, but others
living on farms, or teaching in Michigan and elsewhere. Whoever grows
seeds to sell, or buys seeds to sow, should be benefited by consulting
the illustrations which are unsurpassed for accuracy by anything in this
country. They were all made by Mr. F. H. Hillman. A hand lens costing
from twenty cents to a dollar is almost indispensable in examining our
seeds. The brief descriptions are necessarily made by using definite
scientific terms, which are explained in a glossary at the close of the
work. A few weeds are not illustrated, for the reason that the plants
have ceased to produce seeds, such as the horse radish, and some of them
are not conspicuously bad. Not far from half the illustrations are made
from small seed-like fruits, likely to be mistaken for seeds, such as
are produced by dandelions, burdocks, narrow-leaved dock, all grasses.
Cuts of seeds of several clovers are inserted that students may learn to
distinguished them from weeds too often mixed with them.

No apology is offered for making use of the decimal scale instead of the
cumbersome antiquated English scale, which fortunately is gradually
growing out of use. In the back part of the bulletin are duplicate
copies of the decimal scale that any one can cut out and use for
measuring.

For copies of the following figures some time ago prepared by Mr.
Hillman, we are indebted to the authorities of the Agricultural College,
of Reno, Nevada: 7, 11, 12, 16, 17, 23, 24, 31, 32, 34, 35, 36, 37, 39,
40, 41, 42, 44, 46, 55, 56, 58, 63, 68, 69, 71, 74, 75, 84, 86, 87, 91,

    "A weed is any useless or troublesome plant."
    "A plant out of place or growing where it is not wanted."
    "Tobacco."
    "A plant whose virtues have not yet been discovered."--Emerson.

Weeds everywhere; they thrive in the cornfield, they choke wheat in the
field, they annoy the gardner, they thrive in the meadow, they spring up
by the roadside, they encroach on the swamp, they damage the fleeces of
sheep. The rapid increase in the number and variety of weeds should
cause alarm.


DISADVANTAGES OF WEEDS.

1. They rob cultivated plants of nutriment.

2. They injure crops by crowding and shading.

3. They retard the work of harvesting grain by increasing the draft and
by extra wear of machinery. (Bindweed, thistles, red root.)

4. They retard the drying of grain and hay.

5. They increase the labor of threshing, and make cleaning of seed
difficult.

6. They damage the quality of flour, sometimes making it nearly
worthless. (Allium vineale L.)

7. Most of them are of little value as food for domestic animals.

8. Some weeds injure stock by means of barbed awns. (Squirrel tail
grass, wild oats, porcupine grass.)

9. Some of them injure wool and disfigure the tails of cattle, the manes
and tails of horses. (Burdock, cocklebur, houndstongue.)

10. A few make "Hair balls" in the stomachs of horses. (Rabbit-foot
clover, crimson clover.)

11. Some injure the quality of dairy products. (Leeks, wild onions.)

12. Penny cress, and probably others, when eaten by animals, injure the
taste of meat.

13. Poison hemlock, spotted cowbane and Jamestown weed are very
poisonous.

14. Many weeds interfere with a rotation of crops.

15. All weeds damage the appearance of a farm and render it less
valuable. (Quack-grass, Canada thistle, plantains.)


SOME SMALL BENEFITS.

1. They are of some use in the world to induce more frequent and more
thorough cultivation, which benefits crops.

2. The new arrival of a weed of first rank stimulates watchfulness.
(Russian thistle.)

3. In occupying the soil after a crop has been removed they prevent the
loss of fertility by shading the ground.

4. Weeds plowed under add some humus and fertility to the soil, though
in a very much less degree than clover or cow peas.

5. Some of them furnish food for birds in winter.


WHAT ENABLES A PLANT TO BECOME A WEED.

1. Sometimes by producing an enormous number of weeds. (A large plant of
purslane, 1,250,000 seeds; a patch of daisy fleabane, 3,000 to a square
inch.)

2. In other cases by the great vitality of their seeds. Shepherd's
purse, mustard, purslane, pigeon-grass, pigweeds, pepper-grass, May
weed, evening primrose, smart weed, narrow-leaved dock, two chick-weeds
survive when buried in the soil thirty years at least, as I have found
by actual test.

3. In each prickly fruit of a cocklebur there are two seeds, only one of
which grows the first year, the other surviving to grow the second year.

4. Some are very succulent, and ripen seeds even when pulled.
(Purslane.)

5. Often by ripening and scattering seeds before the cultivated crop is
mature. (Red root, fleabane.)

6. Sometimes by ripening seeds at the time of harvesting a crop, when
all are harvested together. (Chess, cockle.)

7. Some seeds are difficult to separate from seeds of the crop
cultivated. (Sorrel, mustard, narrow-leaved plantain in seeds of red
clover and alfalfa.)

8. Some are very small and escape notice. (Mullein, fleabane.)

9. Some plants go to seed long before suspected, as no showy flowers
announce the time of bloom. (Pigweeds.)

10. In a few cases the plants break loose from the soil when mature and
become tumble-weeds. (Some pigweeds, Russian thistle.)

11. Some seeds and seed-like fruits are furnished each with a balloon,
or a sail, or with grappling hooks. (Dandelion, sticktights, burdock.)

12. Some remain with the dead plant long into winter, and when torn off
by the wind or by birds, drift for long distances on the snow, often
from one farm to another. (Pigweeds.)

13. Some have creeping root-stocks or tubers. (Quack-grass, nut-grass.)

14. Some defend themselves with forks and bayonets. (Thistles.)

15. Most of them are disagreeable in taste or odor, so that domestic
animals leave them to occupy the ground and multiply. (Jamestown weed,
stink grass, milk weed.)

16. Plants with stout roots are sometimes passed over by the harrow or
cultivator.


HOW ARE WEEDS INTRODUCED AND HOW ARE THEY SPREAD?

1. By live stock, carried in the hair or fleece or carried by the feet;
in some instances passing alive with the excrement.

2. By unground feed-stuff purchased.

3. By adhering to the insides of sacks where they were placed with
grain.

4. In barnyard manure drawn from town.

5. In the packing of trees, crockery, baled hay and straw.

6. By wagons, sleighs, threshing machines.

7. Sometimes by plows, cultivators and harrows.

8. By railway trains passing through or near a farm.

9. By ballast of boats at wharves.

10. By wool-waste at factories.

11. By birds, squirrels, and mice.

12. By water of brooks, rivers, by washing rains and by irrigating
ditches.

13. By the wind aided by little wings or down, or by drifting on the
snow.

14. By dropping seeds to the ground from extending branches and
repeating the process.

15. By creeping root-stocks, as June grass, quack-grass and toad-flax.

16. By piercing potatoes, carrots, etc., quack-grass, June grass,
Bermuda grass are sometimes carried to other fields or farms where the
tubers and roots are planted.

17. A farmer buys clover seeds or grass seeds that were grown in some
state that never before grew seeds that went onto his farm and thus he
may get some new weeds. Seeds of alfalfa or some other crop bring new
kinds of weeds, especially those of dodder. As every kind of weed goes
onto a farm to stay there it follows that as a country becomes older the
greater the number of kinds of weeds. As a rule each farm is annually
getting more sorts of weeds, and as each farmer is cultivating weeds,
they are more freely distributed in every field and along every roadside
and by exchanging they are carried to neighboring and distant farms.

A great many farmers buy and sow whatever the merchant offers them under
the name mentioned. For example, the college has a sample of something
called clover seed, sold by a dealer in this state. It contains about 40
per cent of narrow-leaved plantain.


WHERE CERTAIN WEEDS ARE TROUBLESOME.

To begin with, years and years ago no new farm in the wilderness of
Michigan contained more than twenty to thirty-five kinds of weeds, as
there were not more than thirty-five sorts in the entire state, while at
present there are not far from 250 kinds. A large majority of weeds hail
from older countries, more especially from Europe.

There are a few weeds, like Canada thistle and quack-grass, that may
infest any crop of farm or garden, but in most cases, whether to call a
weed very bad depends on the nature of the crop grown, the size of the
weed-seeds and their time of ripening.

Some weeds have a very wide distribution, thriving all around the world
in temperate climates, while others are more limited in range; some
thrive only in dry, thin, sandy soil and others in wet soils. To some
extent the presence of a few weed-seeds is almost as objectionable when
once on the farm, as though there were more, because these few may
thrive and seed freely.

In many respects the lists of weeds for New Jersey is different from the
list in Michigan, while half the weeds of Nevada or Oregon are not known
in our state.

Chess, cockle, red root and rye are liable to be troublesome in fields
of winter wheat, because the seeds are more or less difficult to
separate from this grain and for the reason that they require a portion
of two years to come to maturity.

Meadows and pastures, especially where the land is not fertile, abound
in weeds that require two years or more to produce seeds, such as
narrow-leaved dock, bitter dock, bull thistle, carrot, teasel, two kinds
of mulleins, night-flowering catchfly, evening primrose, several kinds
of fleabane, ox-eye daisy, orange hawkweed, two or three kinds of
plantain, Canada thistle, hound's tongue, stick seed, sow thistle, horse
nettle, buttercups, toad flax, silvery cinquefoil, and many more, not
excluding some annuals, like crab-grass, tickle grass, pigeon grasses.
As crops of corn, potatoes, beans, turnips, beets and squashes are ready
to harvest at the close of one growing season they are molested more or
less by pigeon grasses, several pigweeds, purslane, crab-grass, barnyard
grass, tickle grass and a number of others.

In 1897 some seventy-five lots of timothy seeds were examined and the
following list of twenty-four species of weeds were found. Doubtless
other weeds may still be found in other lots of timothy seed. No sample
was entirely free from weeds. Pepper grass was most common, next
followed tumble weed and then shepherd's purse:

  Amaranthus graecizans, Tumble weed.
  Amaranthus retroflexus, Rough pigweed.
  Anthemis Cotula, May weed.
  Brassica arvensis, Charlock.
  Brassica nigra, Black mustard.
  Bursa Bursa-pastoris, Shepherd's purse.
  Carduus arvensis, Canada thistle.
  Carex straminea. A kind of sedge.
  Chenopodium album, Pigweed.
  Chenopodium filicifolium, Another kind of pigweed.
  Lactuca Canadensis, Wild Lettuce.
  Lepidium Virginicum, Wild Pepper-grass.
  Onagra biennis, Evening primrose.
  Panicum capillare, Hair grass, tickle grass.
  Plantago lanceolata, Narrow-leaved plantain.
  Plantago Rugelii, Rugel's Plantain, one of the broad-leaved plantains.
  Poa compressa, Flat-stemmed poa, wire grass.
  Potentilla Monspeliensis, Rough cinquefoil.
  Prunella vulgaris, Self-heal.
  Rumex Acetocella, Field or sheep sorrel.
  Sisymbrium officinale, Hedge mustard.
  Verbena angustifolia, Narrow-leaved vervain.
  Verbena hastata, Blue vervain.
  Verbena urticifolia, White vervain.

In examining some 130 lots of clover seeds as found in the market during
1897, thirty-two kinds of weed seeds were found. Sheep sorrel was most
common, next to this yellow or bitter dock and green foxtail. Only three
samples of clover seed was free from weeds, but possibly some weeds
might have been seen if larger quantities had been looked over.

During the year 1908, eleven years later, 47 kinds of weed seeds were
found in 122 lots of seed of red clover, a gain of nearly 50 per cent.

During three months from January 1, 1910, in examining 450 lots of seeds
of grasses, clovers and alfalfas, besides large numbers of common weeds
that we know, were 74 kinds not known to the writer. Of these 74 kinds,
probably some will never become weeds of any account. Some of these came
with alfalfa from Montana and some were importations from Europe and
elsewhere.

Parasitic fungi rank as weeds; such as rusts and smuts of wheat, oats,
corn; apple scab, black knot of plum, brown rot of cherry, anthracnose
of beans.


SOME MEANS FOR PREVENTING THE INTRODUCTION OF WEEDS AND A FEW RULES FOR
THEIR EXTERMINATION.

1. The right kind of a man, who will carefully observe and study the
kinds of weeds and their habits, fighting each to the best advantage, i.
e. with method.

2. See that all seeds purchased or grown at home for seed are free from
seeds of weeds. Although often heard, these words are too little
heeded.

3. See that threshing machines, hay racks, grain bags from other farms
are well cleaned before used on the farm.

4. Cook or grind screenings and burn chaff when certain weeds are
suspected.

5. Send seeds to the Agricultural College, East Lansing, for
identification, unless they are known to be harmless.

6. Strive to prevent weeds from ripening seeds. This is especially
important late in the season in case of all pigweeds, purslane and
others where the flowers are very small and are liable to be overlooked
and the seeds ripen before their presence is suspected.

7. For meadow or pasture make the soil very fertile, as most weeds will
then be killed or crowded by the better grass and become of little
account.

8. Modify the rotation of crops with reference to killing the weeds.

9. Make a specialty of hoed or cultivated crops.

10. Make soiling crops a prominent feature in certain fields.

11. Smother weeds with quick growing and thickly seeded crops, like red
clover or rye or buckwheat.

12. Keep some crops growing on the land from early spring till late
autumn,--double cropping, i. e., two cultivated crops in one year for
barn and cellar instead of one for use and one of weeds.

13. Cultivate thoroughly after a crop is removed.

14. Clean up and avoid leaving any vacant or out of the way places for
breeding ground.

15. Where practicable, remove fences and cultivate to the gutters of the
highway.

16. Keep some sheep.

17. When once begun, continue the work thoroughly from year to year,
giving no quarter to weeds. This is the easiest in the long run and the
royal way.

18. Where hand labor is employed, it is far less expensive and much
easier to keep weeds down by raking or hoeing once a week than by going
over the ground much less frequently.

The habits of a weed determine to a great extent the best mode of
fighting it. Certain remedies suggest themselves for creeping
perennials, like quack grass and toad flax, while different treatment is
best for narrow-leaved dock; and still a different mode of attack may be
adopted for crab grass and purslane.

Weeds are annuals, as pigweeds, crab grass, purslane; biennials as bull
thistle and mulleins; perennials, like quack grass, Canada thistle,
ox-eye Daisy.

Will it pay? The annual cost of successfully fighting a weedy farm of
100 acres in Ontario has been found to be about $75. Good cultivation in
the long run pays a greater profit than slipshod culture. It not only
kills the weeds, but keeps the soil in condition for securing good
crops. It conserves moisture.

Perennial plants cannot gain any if the green leaves are not allowed to
appear. The nourishment stored in the root stocks underground will aid
the plant to send up slender leaves and if these remain, the plants gain
and recruit, but if the leaves start underground and are cut off before
coming to the light, these root stocks are drawn on again to furnish
food to start more leaves and thus, in time become exhausted.




SEEDS OF MICHIGAN WEEDS.


ASCOMYCETES.

[Illustration: Fig. 1.]

=Ergot.= _Claviceps purpurea._ This is a poisonous fungus, not a seed,
mentioned here because it is frequently found as an outgrowth of the
grain of many grasses, such as rye, timothy, red top. To mature spores,
it must pass to another stage requiring six months or more.


GRASS FAMILY. GRAMINEAE.

[Illustration: Fig. 2.]

=Quack-Grass. Couch-Grass.= _Agropyron repens_ (L.) Beauv. Florets about
1 cm. long, 5-nerved at the short-awned apex: grain seldom produced and
still less frequently found apart from the floral glume and palea,
linear, about 4 mm. long, base abruptly acute, apex rounded, rounded on
the back or outside, inside concave. Our worst weed. Introduced from
Europe.

[Illustration: Fig. 3.]

=Wild Oat.= _Avena fauta_ L. Freed from chaff the floral glume is firm,
rough, brown, thinly hairy, about 15 mm. long, awn from near the middle
2-4 cm. long with several firm twists, abruptly bent near the middle,
the true grain seldom separated from the firmer floral glume. A bad weed
in Oregon and California, seldom seen in Michigan.

[Illustration: Fig. 4.]

=Field Chess.= _Bromus arvensis_ (L.) Not often seen in this country;
floral glume 6-7 mm. long bearing an awn rather longer; grain much like
that of _B. secalinus_ which see. Introduced from Europe.

[Illustration: Fig. 5.]

=Soft Chess.= _Bromus hordeaceus_ L. (_Bromus mollis_). Floral glume
extending beyond the grain, 5-7 nerved, 6-9 mm. long, grain rounded on
the back, shape of a shallow boat, 6.5 mm. long, palea thin with
comb-like teeth on the margins. Waste places, thin meadows. Introduced
from Europe.

[Illustration: Fig. 6.]

=Smooth Brome-grass.= _Bromus racemosus_ L. Florets about 9 mm. long,
awn 6-10 mm. long; longer, softer, thinner, with longer awn than found
in florets of _B. secalinus_ which see. Not often seen in this country.
Introduced from Europe.

[Illustration: Fig. 7.]

=Chess Cheat.= _Bromus secalinus_ L. Florets swollen a little above the
middle, the floral glume rounded on the back, obscurely 7-nerved, 6-7
mm. long, an awn 3-4 mm. long, more or less; palea covering the concave
side, each edge bearing a single row of stiff hairs; glume and palea
closely adhering to the grain. Introduced from Europe. A weed in wheat
fields.

[Illustration: Fig. 8.]

=Barren Brome Grass.= _Bromus sterilis_ L. Floral glume minutely
roughened, adhering to the grain; 5-7 nerved; 11-15 mm. long;
compressed; concave in section. Introduced from Europe, becoming common
in the state.

[Illustration: Fig. 9.]

=Sand-Bur. Bur-Grass.= _Cenchrus tribuloides_ L. Spikelets consisting of
the grain and its coverings, broad oval, somewhat flattened, about 7 mm.
long, thinly covered by stiff, straight, barbed, prickles, 2-5 mm.
long, making a disagreeable and formidable bur, often common on sandy
land. Native of this country.

[Illustration: Fig. 10.]

=Bermuda Grass.= _Cynodon Dactylon_ L., Pers., (Capriola Dactylon (L.)
Kuntze). Floral glume enclosing the grain, smooth, light colored, oval
to half-oval, 1.5 to 2 mm. long, in cross section with two long sides
and a short side half as long; grain light brown, obovate to oval, a
small nipple at the larger end.

The plant seeds in hot countries but not in cool, temperate regions;
spreading chiefly by coarse, hard rootstocks. Introduced.

green, oval, flattened, kidney-shaped, with a tubercle near the middle
of the concave edge or like the figure, 1.5-1.8 mm. long. Introduced
from Europe and becoming frequent in grass land. Its worst feature is to
supply seeds that may be mistaken for and mixed with seeds of alfalfa
and red clover. The seeds differ from those of alfalfa in being more
commonly egg-shaped than kidney-shaped in outline. The scar is nearer
the small extremity in these seeds than in those of alfalfa. For pasture
this is less valuable than white clover.

[Illustration: Fig. 109.]

Introduced from Europe. Seeds used to adulterate those of alfalfa.

[Illustration: Fig. 111.]

=Alsike Clover.= _Trifolium hybridum_ L. Seeds dull yellowish green to
very dark green, some of them mottled, lighter about the seed scar,
flattened, one of the rounded edges thicker than the other, and between

darker in color and rather smaller. Red clover and mammoth clover are
usually much mixed.

[Illustration: Fig. 114.]

=Low Hop-clover.= _Trifolium procumbens_ L. A low, yellow-flowered
annual, often becoming a tumble-weed at maturity. Seeds plump, shining,
straw-colored to light brown, broad oval, very slightly flattened, 1 mm.
long, three-fourths anatropous, i. e., the scar is a very little
distance from one end of the seed. A little way back of the scar on each
side is a light-colored depression. Rather rapidly spreading. From
Europe.

[Illustration: Fig. 115.]

=White Clover.= _Trifolium repens_ L. Seeds scarcely shining, yellow to
light brown, flattened, one of the rounded edges thinner than the other,
and between the two a slight groove on each side, one end rounded, the
other truncate with a slight depression in the center containing the
seed scar 1.-1.2 mm. long to 1 mm. wide. The seeds that are truncate at
one end are anatropous, some of them resembling those of red clover are
half anatropous. Common and well known, possibly native to the northern
country.

mm. long. True seed light brown, ovoid-lanceolate 2.5-2.7 mm. long.
Introduced from Europe.

This plant is not yet common in our state, but, judging from its
behavior in the botanic garden, it is destined soon to become a bad
weed. On the desert ranches of Arizona, Nevada and elsewhere, it
furnishes much pasture.

[Illustration: Fig. 117.]

=Cut-leaved Crane's bill.= _Geranium dissectum_ L. Seed light brown,

NIGHT SHADE FAMILY. SOLANACEAE.

[Illustration: Fig. 160.]

=Jimson Weed. Thorn-apple.= _Datura Stramonium_ L. Pods ovoid, densely
prickly, about 4 cm. long; seeds black to brown, flattened, with 6-10
slight irregular elevations, the whole surface covered with minute
shallow pits, short kidney shaped, i. e., one edge nearly straight or

8-10 mm. in diameter; seeds finely granular, dull, yellowish to light
brown, flattened, unsymmetrically ovate, about 1.5 mm. long. Native to

when ripe make good pies, whether the uncooked fruit is poisonous there
is less proof. Of little importance.

[Illustration: Fig. 164.]

=Beaked Nightshade.= _Solanum rostratum_ Dunal. Fruit surrounded by a
persistent prickly calyx about 2 cm. long; seeds flattened, irregularly
undulate or wrinkled, dark brown or black, usually ovate or circular in
outline, 2-2.5 mm. in diameter, surface covered with small pits.

mm. high; seeds cannot be distinguished with certainty by means of the
ordinary lens from those of moth mullein. The pitted surface seems to
predominate in _Verbascum Blattaria_, while the grooved surface seems to
be more common in the seeds of V. Thapsus. Introduced from Europe.
Common in thin pastures.

[Illustration: Fig. 167.]

=Wall Speedwell.= _Veronica arvensis_ L. Pods heart-shaped; seeds dull,

heart-shaped; seeds pale yellow, a trifle darker than those of V.
officinalis, light, reddish yellow, in shape and markings much like
those of V. peregrina, flattened, broadly oval to obovate .5-.7 mm.
long, with a small scar near the middle on one side, from which extends
a dark line (raphe) to one extremity.

Mich.

[Illustration: Fig. 172.]

=Large-bracted Plantain.= _Plantago aristata_ Michx. Seeds oval, dull,
light to dark brown, 2.2-3 mm. long, shaped like a shallow, thick-walled
canoe with ends rounded alike, outer face marked by a shallow,
transverse groove at or near the middle, a white line marking the margin
at the base on the canoe inside, two white-margined pits occupying the
middle of the concave side. Introduced from the west in clover seeds,
not yet common.

[Illustration: Fig. 173.]

shining, amber-colored to brown, oval, 2-2.5 mm. long, shaped like a
shallow, thick-walled canoe with ends rounded alike, a dark scar
occupying the middle of the narrow concave side, a faint, transverse
groove across the convex side near the middle sometimes apparent. Often
found mixed with clover seeds from which it is very difficult to
separate. Introduced from Europe.

[Illustration: Fig. 174.]

=Broad-leaved Plantain.= _Plantago major_ L. Seeds, light to dark brown
or very nearly black, 1-1.5 mm. long, slightly flattened, with acute
edges very variable in shape, oval, oblong, rhomboidal and trapezoid,
the surface roughened by slender, colored ridges, appearing under the
lens as slightly wavy lines, radiating from the scar. The clear light
green color of the lower end of the leaf-stem is an easy mark to
distinguish this plant from another broad-leaved plantain, _P. Rugelii_
in which the base of leaf is red. Introduced from Europe. About door
yards.

[Illustration: Fig. 175.]

=Rugel's Broad-leaved Plantain.= _Plantago Rugelii Decne._ Seeds dark
brown to black, much like those of P. major, but larger, 1.5-2.5 mm.

of leaf-stalk red, and not clear green as in P. major. A vile pest in
clover fields.


MADDER FAMILY.

[Illustration: Fig. 176.]

=Blue Field Madder.= _Sherardia arvensis_ L. The parts often called
seeds are in reality the half-fruits ripened, each one bearing at the
apex three, white, pointed, persistent calyx lobes, the inner face
showing a vertical groove, and in some of the fruits the calyx is broken
off. Surface dull brown, clothed with small white hairs, obovoid, 2-2.5

Michigan.

[Illustration: Fig. 182.]

=May-weed. Dog's-Fennel.= _Anthemis Cotula_ L. Outer flowers white;
achenes straw color to light brown, obovoid (large end uppermost) to

this species, when compared with A. minus, are darker colored, rather
longer, the ribs more distinct.

=Smaller Burdock.= _Arctium minus_ Beruh. Possibly only a variety of _A.
Lappa_ L., but the prevailing plant in central Michigan. I see no way of
distinguishing the achenes of one from the other; but it makes little
difference as one burdock is as bad as another.

thistle, some of them smooth, others finely grooved or ridged
lengthwise, others somewhat wrinkled, 2.5-3 mm. long. Occasionally
introduced from the west with seeds of grasses or clover. Usually not
persistent in Michigan.

=Artichoke.= _Helianthus tuberosus_ L. Flowers yellow; achenes black,
shiny more or less, slightly flattened, pubescent with very short hairs,
with four obtuse angles, narrowly obovate, 6-7 mm. long, one side of the
smaller end projecting beyond the other side. Native of this country;
cultivated by Indians.

=Golden Mouse or Orange-Ear Hawkweed. Devil's Paint-Brush.= _Hieracium
aurantiacum._ Flowers orange yellow; achenes jet black, oblong, straight
or curved, apex truncate, base abruptly tapering, cylindrical, the sides
bearing 10 narrow, vertical ridges. Introduced from Europe. In Eastern
New York and Western Massachusetts meadows abound in large areas of this
vile weed, 1.8-2.2 mm. long.

[Illustration: Fig. 201.]

=Mouse-Ear Hawkweed.= _Hieracium Pilosella_ L. Flowers yellow; achenes
jet black, oblong, straight or curved, apex truncate, base abruptly
pointed, cylindrical or narrowly oval, the sides bearing 10 narrow
vertical ridges. Introduced from Europe. The achenes very closely
resemble those of the orange hawkweed. It doesn't matter much, for the
habits are the same, and one is about as noxious as the other.
Introduced from Europe.

[Illustration: Fig. 202.]

=Elecampane.= _Inula Helenium_ L. Flowers yellow; achenes light brown,
straight or curved, linear, flattened, 4-5 mm. long, 4 sided with 5-8
obscure vertical ridges on each side, apex concave, the margin bearing a
circle of short stiff bristles, the remains of longer ones. Introduced
from Europe. Not common.

[Illustration: Fig. 203.]

=Marsh Elder.= _Iva xanthiifolia_ (Fresen.) Nutt. Achenes various shades
of brown to black, flattened or rhombic in section, obovoid, 1.5-2 mm.
long, longitudinally, striate with fine lines. Native to the upper
peninsula of Michigan where it most likely was at one time introduced
from the west. It has not been found in the lower peninsula, probably
because it had no means of coming across Lake Michigan.

[Illustration: Fig. 204.]

=Wild Lettuce.= _Lactuca Canadensis_ L. Flowers yellow; achenes black or
nearly so, flattened, oval, bearing 3 ribs, the lateral ones sometimes
double, the middle one slender, surface abounding in minute transverse
ridges as seen under a lens, the remains of a beak sometimes remaining.
Native of this country. Other species of Lettuce are more or less
troublesome.

[Illustration: Fig. 205.]

=Prickly Lettuce.= _Lactuca virosa_ L. For many years erroneously called
_Lactuca scariola_. Flowers yellow; achenes dull, dark brown, mottled
with black, flattened, bearing 5-7 rough, vertical ridges, interspersed
by as many smaller ones; oblong, obovate, widest toward the tapering
apex. 3-3.5 mm. long. Some of the leaves turn one edge up and the other
down. Introduced from Europe and has proved itself a remarkable
traveller.

[Illustration: Fig. 206.]

=Fall Dandelion.= _Leontodon autumnalis_ L. Flowers yellow; achenes
light brown, linear, with 5 broad, rounded ribs; achene 4-6.5 mm. long,
straight or curved, the outer traversed, with low transverse ridges.
Introduced from Europe.

[Illustration: Fig. 207.]

=Black-eyed Susan. Yellow Daisy.= _Rudbeckia hirta_ L. Achene
purple-brown to black, slightly tapering from base to apex 1.5-1.8 mm.
long, base abruptly pointed, apex truncate, in cross section nearly
square, having 5-7 slender vertical ridges on each side besides a larger
one at each of the four corners. Widely distributed in meadows and
pastures.

[Illustration: Fig. 208.]

=Corn Sow-Thistles.= _Sonchus arvensis_ L. Flowers yellow; achenes dull,
dark reddish brown, oblong, extremities blunt, slightly flattened,
bearing four coarse, fold-like ridges, with two smaller ridges between
each of the two large ones, transversely wrinkled, 2.5-3 mm. long. This
species is a perennial spreading by roots-stalks as well as by seeds.
Introduced in Europe.

[Illustration: Fig. 209.]

=Spiny Sow-Thistle.= _Sonchus asper_ (L.) Hill. Flowers pale yellow;
achenes dull straw-color to reddish brown, much flattened, obovate,
oblong, extremities blunt, each side bearing 3-5 vertical ridges,
surface nearly smooth, 2.5-3 mm. long. Introduced from Europe.

[Illustration: Fig. 210.]

=Common Sow-Thistle.= _Sonchus oleraceus_ L. Flowers pale yellow;
achenes reddish brown, linear, oblanceolate, 3 mm. long, flattened
extremities blunt, 5 uneven wrinkled ridges on each side. Introduced
from Europe.

[Illustration: Fig. 211.]

=Red-Seeded Dandelion.= _Taraxacum erythrospermum_ Andrz. Achene bright
red or red reddish brown, flattened, oblanceolate, 3 mm. long, 1 mm.
wide or less, the red beak 1 mm. long, prickles often extending nearly
to the base along twelve vertical ribs, the achenes narrower, shorter,
much darker in color, with prickles extending farther down the ribs, the
short beak longer; the plant is earlier, often smaller, when compared
with the other species.

Doubtless this is more common than has been reported, having been
overlooked. Introduced from Europe.

[Illustration: Fig. 212.]

=Dandelion.= _Taraxacum officinale_ Weber. _Taraxacum Taraxacum_ (L.)
Karst. Flowers yellow; achenes dull light to dark brown, flattened
oblanceolate, thread-like beak two to three times as long as the achene,
the stout colored beak 0.5 mm. long. The most conspicuous character of
the achenes lies in the barb-like-toothed edges and ridges of each of
the similar faces, extending along the upper half. Achene, 3-4 mm. long,
having twelve longitudinal ridges, 1.2 mm. wide. Introduced from Europe.
Troublesome on thin lawns.

[Illustration: Fig. 213.]

=Salsify. Oyster-Plant.= _Tragopogon porrifolius_ L. Flowers purple;
achenes dull light brown, nearly cylindrical; apex tapering, mostly
terminating in a slender beak which is often longer than the body of the
achene. Achene straight or curved, 10-ribbed, 12-18 mm. long, outermost
coarsely roughened by upwardly directed, whitish, scale-like
projections. Native of Europe.

=Meadow Salsify. Yellow Goat's Beard.= _Tragopogon pratensis_ L. Flowers
yellow; achenes dull, light brown, nearly cylindrical, apex tapering,
mostly terminating in a slender beak. Achene straight or curved,
10-ribbed, 12-15 mm. long, the inner ones of the head smooth, the
outer-most coarsely roughened by upwardly directed, whitish, scale-like
projections. Introduced from Europe.

[Illustration: Fig. 214.]

=American Cocklebur.= _Xanthium Canadensis_ Mill. Achenes or burs
reddish brown, oblong, circular in section, two-beaked, about 20 mm.
long, covered with stout hooked prickles. Each bur encloses two seeds.
Native of this country.

[Illustration: Fig. 215.]

=Spiny Clotbur.= _Xanthium spinosum_ L. Bur oblong, light brown, very
slightly flattened, 10-13 mm. long, the beaks weak and small, small
hooked prickles 3-4 mm. long, each bur contains two seeds. Introduced
from Europe.

=Broad Cocklebur.= _Xanthium strumarium_ L. Bur dark brown, oval,
circular in sections 12-22 mm. long, beaks stout, nearly straight,
spines about 5 mm. long, surface of burs and base of spines clothed with
minute hooked prickles. Naturalized from Europe.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
