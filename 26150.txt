PREFACE.


The gathering together of the Proverbs of Scotland has occupied the
attention of several collectors. The earliest work on the subject which
has been traced is that of Beaton, Archbishop of Glasgow, who, about the
time of the Reformation, made a small collection. The definite
information which we have of this work is so very slight, however, that
it has been of little or no value to subsequent collectors and writers
on the subject. The first collection of importance is the well-known one
made by the Rev. David Fergusson, minister of Dunfermline, who was a
contemporary of Archbishop Beaton. Fergusson's collection, which
numbered 940 proverbs, was, all circumstances considered, a very
commendable one; and it has served as a foundation to the labours of
subsequent workers in the same field. The next is that of James Kelly,
published in London in 1721. This volume contains nearly 3000 proverbs,
and is very carefully arranged, with notes and parallel illustrations.
The collection of Kelly is an able and valuable one, as he was perfectly
conversant with the subject of proverbs generally; but we are compelled
to agree with Motherwell, when he says that this writer's rendering of
the Scottish dialect is "most barbarous;" nor do we wonder that it
excited the profound contempt of Allan Ramsay, who, from his thorough
knowledge of the Scottish vernacular, was openly indignant at the
reputation gained by Kelly's work, and made a collection himself, which
was published at Edinburgh in 1763. In a sensible but pedantic preface,
which he addressed to the "Tenantry of Scotland, Farmers of the Dales,
and Storemasters of the Hills," he states his reasons for issuing a work
on the subject, and strongly recommends the use of proverbs,
particularly among the agricultural portion of the community. After
alluding to the work of Kelly as a "late large book of them, fou of
errors, in a style neither Scots nor English," he goes on to say:--"As
naething helps our happiness mair than to hae the mind made up with
right principles, I desire you, for the thriving and pleasure of you and
yours, to use your een and lend your lugs to these _guid auld says_,
that shine with wail'd sense, and will as lang as the world wags. Gar
your bairns get them by heart; let them hae a place among your family
books; and may never a window-sole through the country be without them.
On a spare hour, when the day is clear, behind a rick, or on the green
howm, draw the treasure frae your pouch and enjoy the pleasant
companion. Ye happy herds, while your hirdsels are feeding on the
flowery braes, you may eithly mak yoursels maisters of the hale ware!
How usefou it will prove to you (wha hae sae few opportunities of common
clattering) when you forgather with your friends at kirk or market,
banquet or bridal! By your proficiency, you'll be able, in a proverbial
way, to keep up the soul of a conversation, that is baith blythe and
usefou."

Nearly a hundred years elapsed before a new collection appeared,
although, during that period, many editions of the works which we have
mentioned were brought out to supply the demands of a proverb-loving
public. In 1832, the collection formed by Andrew Henderson was published
at Glasgow. It is based upon the previous books, and is a very extensive
one, although in arrangement it is defective. This collection, which is
more ample than the former ones, has the advantage of an elaborate
historical and literary disquisition on the general subject, in the
form of an introduction by the poet Motherwell, which is allowed to be
one of the most interesting and comprehensive papers on proverbs which
has yet appeared.

The present collection of Scottish Proverbs, the first edition of which
appeared in 1862, while it is the most extensive and systematic that has
yet appeared, claims to be little more than a mere mechanical
compilation. It was suggested by the work of Henderson, and has been
carefully collated with it, and also with the previous collections of
Fergusson, Kelly, and Ramsay. Large additions have been made from
various sources, such as the works of Sir Walter Scott, Galt, Hogg, and
other national writers, while not a few have been picked up and
registered as they fell from the lips of friends and strangers with whom
the compiler came in contact.

Throughout the volume, a considerable number of notes are introduced.
These notes the compiler had some hesitation in inserting, from a
feeling that many of them were mere literal explanations or
illustrations, conveying generally but a very poor idea of the deeper
meaning which the proverbs themselves are capable of yielding; and also
in deference to opinions which have been expressed as to the propriety
of adding notes to a collection of proverbs at all, as every reader of
intelligence is competent to put an individual construction upon each,
suited to circumstances; while the very wide inferences and applications
which can be extracted from many of them, render the adapting of a brief
and satisfactory note, in many cases, an impossibility. As it is,
however, little merit is claimed for them; and if they are found to be
of no aid in facilitating an interpretation, they will, at least, tend
to relieve the monotonous or catalogue effect, so to speak, which is apt
to be felt by many readers when perusing works arranged in alphabetical
order. In all cases where the compiler could adapt a quotation or
parallel proverb, he did so in preference to inserting an original note.
To apply a proverb from the collection, it is hoped that, after all, the
notes will be found no worse than "Like a chip among parritch--little
gude, little ill." A simple but comprehensive Glossary is appended,
containing and explaining the meaning of the Scottish words to be found
in the book.

Of course, in a work of this nature, it is impossible to prevent
redundancies and repetitions; and when it is mentioned that the
gathering and arrangement of the first edition of this little work
occupied the leisure hours of six years, and a similar period during
the preparation of the present, it will be readily understood that many
of the faults are to be attributed to the length of time which elapsed
during its compilation.

In conclusion, the compiler begs to state that the present edition of
this little work differs very considerably from its predecessor. Upwards
of 2000 additions, alterations, and corrections have been made upon it,
most of which he is of opinion are improvements; so that the book is,
practically speaking, a new one. He has also to thank the members of the
press for the very flattering reception accorded to the first edition,
and hopes that the new one will be found equally worthy of their
commendation. To several private friends, and very many total strangers,
he desires to express his acknowledgments for many valuable hints and
important additions. As he is anxious that this collection should be as
complete as possible, he will be most happy to receive any suggestion or
addition which may occur to readers, and would respectfully solicit such
with a view to their incorporation in a subsequent edition, should such
be required.

    coat he wears--but it doesna signify.' And, as he spoke, he (the
    Laird of Dumbiedikes) shut successively, and with vehemence, the
    drawers of his treasury. 'A fair offer, Jeannie, is nae cause o'
    feud--ae man may bring a horse to the water, but twenty wunna gar

    joes----'"--_Heart of Midlothian._

Ae man may steal a horse where anither daurna look ower the hedge.

Ae swallow disna mak a summer.

Ae word before is worth twa behint.

Ae year a nurse and seven years a daw.

    Does this very old proverb mean, that if a woman nurses for one
    year, it takes seven years to recover from the effects of it? Ray
    has a very ungallant note on the English version of this: "Because,
    feeding well and doing little, she becomes liquorish, and gets a
    habit of idleness."

A' fails that fools think.

    him."--_Russian._

A findsilly bairn gars his faither be hang'd.

A fisherman's walk--twa steps and overboard.

A fleyer wad aye hae a follower.

    This proverb illustrates a song of Allan Ramsay's, after an ode by
    Horace, referring to a girl running out of the room, in the hope
    that her lover would follow her.

A fool and his money are sune parted.

A fool at forty will ne'er be wise.

A fool is happier thinking weel o' himself, than a wise man is o' others
thinking weel o' him.

A fool may earn money, but it taks a wise man to keep it.

A fool may gie a wise man a counsel.

    "'Fair and softly gangs far,' said Meiklehose; 'and if a fule may
    gie a wise man a counsel, I wad hae him think twice or he mells with
    Knockdunder.'"--_Heart of Midlothian._

A fool may speer mair questions than a wise man can answer.

    about his business will have foul feet."--_Kelly._

A foul hand maks a clean hearthstane.

A friend at court is worth a penny in the purse.

    Kelly's note on this proverb is not favourable to the court usances
    of his time (1721). "A purse seems to be the only friend at court,
    for, without that, there is nothing there but neglect and empty
    promises."

A friend in need is a friend indeed.

A friend to a' is a friend to nane.

    "Everybody's friend is nobody's friend."--_Spanish._

A friend's dinner's sune dished.

    That is, a true friend is easily served, and will not readily take
    offence.

A friend's ne'er ken't till he's needed.

Aft counting keeps friends lang thegither.

    "Short accounts make long friends."--_English._

After a sort, as Costlet served the king.

    "One Captain Costlet, boasting much of his loyalty, was asked how he
    served the king when he was a captain in Cromwell's army, answered,
    'After a sort.' Spoken when a thing is done slightly."--_Kelly._

After a storm comes a calm.

After cheese, naething.

After clouds comes fair weather.

After dinner sit a while, after supper walk a mile.

    This advice is unfitted for the dining practices of the present day;
    but when our ancestors breakfasted at six, dined at eleven, and
    supped at four or five, the counsel may have been good enough.

After joy comes annoy.

After Lammas, corn ripens by day and night.

After that comes a cow to be shod.

After words come weird: fair fa' them that ca' me "Madam."

    After libel comes proof: let those who speak ill of me look to
    themselves.

After you is gude manners.

    "Spoken when our betters offer to serve us first."--_Kelly._

Aft ettle, whiles hit.

    Often try, occasionally succeed.

Aft times the cautioner pays the debt.

A fu' cup is ill to carry.

A fu' heart is aye kind.

A fu' heart never lee'd.

    Intimating that the truth generally comes out under the impulse of
    the feelings.

A fu' man and a hungry horse aye mak haste hame.

A fu' man's a true man.

    A man under the influence of drink, if he speak at all, speaks
    truth, and often more of that than is pleasant.

A fu' purse maks a haverin merchant.

    A man with a full purse engaged in commercial transactions is apt to
    "haver," or gossip freely.

A fu' purse never lacks friends.

A fu' sack can bear a clout on the side.

    A man in prosperous circumstances can afford to listen to the
    envious remarks of those who have not been so fortunate.

A fu' wame maks a straught back.

    A full stomach makes a man walk erectly.

A gaun fit's aye getting, were it but a thorn or a broken tae.

    "A man of industry will certainly get a living; though the proverb
    is often applied to those who went abroad and got a mischief, when
    they might safely have stayed at home."--_Kelly._

A gentle horse should be sindle spurr'd.

A gi'en game was ne'er won.

    A voluntary concession may be no tribute to the skill of the
    opponent.

A gi'en horse shouldna be looked i' the mouth.

A gi'en piece is soon eaten.

A gowk at Yule 'll no be bright at Beltane.

    He that is a fool at Christmas will not be wise in May.

A great rooser was ne'er a gude rider.

    A great boaster is rarely a great performer.

A greedy e'e ne'er got a fu' wame.

A greedy e'e ne'er got a gude pennyworth.

    This and the preceding proverb signify that a covetous or greedy man
    is never satisfied.

A green wound is half hale.

A green Yule maks a fat kirkyard.

    "Ance I wrought a simmer wi' auld Will Winnet, the bedral, and
    howkit mair graves than ane in my day; but I left him in winter, for
    it was unco cauld wark; and then it cam a green Yule, and the folk
    died thick and fast."--_The Antiquary._

A groat is ill saved that shames its master.

A grunting horse and a graneing wife seldom fail their master.

    People that are constantly in the habit of complaining how ill they
    are, generally contrive to live as long as their neighbours.

A gude beginning maks a gude ending.

A gude calf is better than a calf o' a gude kind.

    The one is good already, while it is possible that the other may
    turn out bad.

A gude cause maks a strong arm.

A gude conscience is the best divinity.

A gude day's darg may be done wi' a dirty spade.

A gude face needs nae band, and an ill ane deserves nane.

A gude name is sooner tint than won.

    again."--_Italian._

A gude pawn never shamed its master.

    "It is no shame for a man to borrow on a good pawn; though I think
    it would be more for his honour to be trusted without
    one."--_Kelly._

A gude paymaster ne'er wants hands to work.

A gude steel is worth a penny.

A gude tale's no the waur o' being twice tauld.

    "It's very true the curates read aye the same words ower again; and
    if they be right words, what for no?--a gude tale's no the waur o'
    being twice tauld, I trow; and a body has aye the better chance to
    understand it."--_Old Mortality._

A gude tongue's a gude safeguard.

A gude wife and health is a man's best wealth.

A gude word is as easy said as an ill ane.

A gude year winna mak him, nor an ill year mar him.

    "A beggar will ne'er be a bankrupt."--_English._

A guilty conscience self accuses.

A hadden tongue maks a slabbered mou'.

    parallel to this is, "They never bodet a house o' gowd, but aye got
    a caber o't."

Carrick for a man, Kyle for a cow, Cunningham for corn and ale, and
Galloway for woo'.

    "This old rhyme points out what each of the three districts of
    Ayrshire, and the neighbouring territory of Galloway, were
    remarkable for producing in greatest perfection. The mountainous
    province of Carrick produced robust men; the rich plains of Kyle
    reared the famous breed of cattle now generally termed the Ayrshire
    breed; and Cunningham was a good arable district. The hills of
    Galloway afford pasture to an abundance of sheep."--_Robert
    Chambers._

Carry saut to Dysart and puddings to Tranent.

    This proverb, the meaning of which is obvious enough, is paralleled
    in all languages. The English say, "To carry coals to Newcastle."
    The French and German suggest that it is not necessary "To send
    water to the sea." The French also say, "To carry leaves to the
    wood;" and the Dutch are wise enough not "To send fir to Norway."
    Neither will the Asiatic "Carry blades to Damascus."

    good qualities and usefulness, which are seen in her daily labours,
    than for her fine dress or her Sunday manners.

Claw for claw, as Conan said to the deil.

    "In the Irish ballads relating to Fion (the Fingal of MacPherson),
    there occurs, as in the primitive poetry of most nations, a cycle of
    heroes, each of whom has some distinguishing attribute; upon these
    qualities, and the adventures of those possessing them, many
    proverbs are formed, which are still current in the Highlands. Among
    other characters, Conan is distinguished as in some respects a kind
    of Thersites, but brave and daring even to rashness. He had made a
    vow that he would never take a blow without returning it; and
    having, like other heroes of antiquity, descended to the infernal
    regions, he received a cuff from the archfiend who presided there,
    which he instantly returned: hence the proverb."--_Sir Walter Scott,
    Note to Waverley._

Clear in the south beguiled the cadger.

    Cadgers (beggars, or gipsy pedlars), from their out-of-door

    proverb means that even the best judges may be occasionally mistaken
    in their opinions. The one following is of similar import.

Clear in the south drown'd the ploughman.

Clecking time's aye canty time.

    Good cheer and mirth in the house when a birth has taken place.

    "'Perhaps,' said Mannering, 'at such a time a stranger's arrival
    might be inconvenient?' 'Hout, na, ye needna be blate about that;
    their house is muckle enough, and clecking time's aye canty
    time.'"--_Guy Mannering._

Daffin' and want o' wit maks auld wives donnart.

Do as the cow o' Forfar did, tak a stannin' drink.

    placed to cool, drank the whole of it. The owner of the ale pursued
    the proprietor of the cow for the value of the ale; but a learned
    bailie, in giving his decision, decreed, that since the ale was
    drank by the cow while standing at the door, it must be considered

Do weel and dread nae shame.

Do weel and hae weel.

Do what ye ought and come what can; think o' ease, but work on.

    addition of his own.

Do what ye ought, and let come what will.

Do your turn weel, and nane will speir what time ye took.

    father's moonlight marriage did to your ain, worthy man!"--_The
    Entail._

Drunk at e'en and dry in the morning.

Drunk folk seldom tak harm.

    The French say, "God helps three kinds of people: fools, children,

    to fu' folk and bairns."

    scout the idea with great indignation."--_Robert Chambers._ There
    are several local additions to this saying, such as "Dunse dings a'
    for braw lads and drucken wives;" "for gude yill and bonnie lasses,"
    &c.

Eats meat, an's never fed; wear claes, an's never cled.

    Of some people it may be said, that "they put their meat in an ill
    skin;" for, notwithstanding that they live well, they appear always
    thin and hungry, and not at all, to use a Scotticism, "like their
    meat." Some people are equally unfortunate with regard to their
    clothing; always amply dressed, they seem the very reverse.

Ell and tell is gude merchandise.

Ell and tell is ne'er forgotten, and the best pay's on the peck bottom.

    "Ell and tell," if we mistake not, refers to good measure and prompt
    payment; and the latter saying may be construed thus:--The grain is
    emptied from the "peck" measure, the measure is inverted, and
    payment for the grain is "told" on the bottom of it.

Enough's as gude as a feast.

Enough's enough o' bread and cheese.

    Meaning, that too much of one thing is not good. The French and

    has the finest children."

Every day is no Yule day; cast the cat a castock.

    "Two great clans fought out a quarrel with thirty men of a side, in
    presence of the king, on the North Inch of Perth, on or about the
    year 1392; a man was amissing on one side, whose room was filled by
    a little bandy-legged citizen of Perth. This substitute, Henry
    Wynd--or, as the Highlanders called him, _Gow Chrom_, that is, the
    bandy-legged smith--fought well, and contributed greatly to the fate
    of the battle, without knowing which side he fought on;--so, 'To
    fight for your ain hand, like Henry Wynd,' passed into a
    proverb."--_Sir Walter Scott, Note to Rob Roy._

Every man has his ain bubbly-jock.

Every man has his ain draff poke, though some hang eider than others.

    The two last sayings are similar in meaning, viz., that every man
    has his imperfections or faults. The latter qualifies the proverb by
    admitting that in some these appear more prominently than in others.

Every man kens best where his ain sair lies.

Every man kens best where his ain shoe binds him.

Every man's blind to his ain cause.

Fair an' foolish, black an' proud, lang an' lazy, little an' loud.

    How far this proverb is borne out by fact is certainly open to

    upon it he says, "Beauty and folly do often go hand in hand, and are
    often matched together."

Fair and softly gangs far.

    "Who goes softly goes safely, and he that goes safely goes
    far."--_Italian._

Fair exchange is nae robbery.

Fair fa' gude drink, for it gars folk speak as they think.

    man."--_Latin._

    last to draw it out."

    or spoil a horn, as my father, the worthy deacon, used to
    say."--_Rob Roy._

He'll mend when he grows better, like sour ale in summer.

    that of keeping light company at a time; such as Jinker the
    horse-couper, and Gibby Gaethroughwi't, the piper o' Cupar; 'O'
    whilk follies, Mr Saunderson, he'll mend, he'll mend,' pronounced
    the bailie. 'Like sour ale in summer,' added Davie Gellatley, who

    of."--_Waverley._

He'll need to dree the dronach o't.

    just real daft--neither to haud nor to bind--a' hirdy girdy--clean
    through ither--the deil's ower Jock Wabster.'"--_Rob Roy._

    "A proverbial phrase expressive of violent excitement, whether in
    respect of rage, or of folly, or of pride; borrowed, perhaps, from
    the fury of an untamed beast, which cannot be so long _held_ that it
    may be _bound_ with a rope."--_Jamieson._

He'll neither hup nor wine.

    Of similar import to the preceding. _Hup_ and _wine_ are two words
    used in guiding plough and cart horses.

He'll never rue but ance, and that'll be a' his life.

    "Ride down to Portanferry, and let nae grass grow at the nag's
    heels; and if ye find him in confinement, ye maun stay beside him
    night and day for a day or twa, for he'll want friends that hae
    baith heart and hand; and if ye neglect this, ye'll never rue but
    ance, for it will be for a' your life."--_Guy Mannering._

He'll no gie an inch o' his will for a span o' his thrift.

    That is, regardless of expense, his wishes must be gratified.

He loes me for little that hates me for nought.

He'll wind you a pirn.

    "An my auld acquaintance be hersel, or onything like hersel, she may
    come to wind us a pirn. It's fearsome baith to see and hear her when
    she wampishes about her arms, and gets to her English, and speaks as
    if she were a prent book--let a-be an auld fisher's wife."--_The
    Antiquary._

He lo'ed mutton weel that lick'd where the ewie lay.

                        Frae tap to middle,
      Looking just like the far-aff end
                        O' an auld fiddle."--_The Farmer's Ha'._

He looks like the laird o' fear.

He loses his time that comes sune to a bad bargain.

Help for help in hairst.

    tails of young mares. They are held as prognosticative of stormy
    weather."--_Robert Chambers._

Here-awa, there-awa, like the Laird o' Hotch Potch's lands.

    "Castle fa'an?--na', but the sute's fa'an, and the thunners come
    right down the kitchen-lumm, and the things are a' lying here-awa,
    there-awa, like the Laird o' Hotch Potch's lands."--_Bride of
    Lammermoor._

Here's the wine, but where's the wa-nuts?

He reives the kirk to theek the quire.

    This saying is, we think, exclusively Scotch. It very briefly but

    That is, he will give as good as he gets. "Let-a-bee for let-a-bee,"

    Meaning that a person would rather conduct a large business himself
    than be troubled with a disagreeable partner.

travel.

I'll say naething, but I'll yerk at the thinking.

    He will keep his sorrows to himself, but the recollection of them
    will make him "yerk," _i.e._, writhe, or start with pain--applied in
    a mental sense.

I'm no that fu', but I'm gayly yet.

    I am not fully satisfied, though I am nearly so.

I'm ower auld a dog to learn new tricks.

I'm speaking o' hay and you o' horse corn.

    That is, I am talking on one subject, while you are talking on
    another.

In a frost a nail is worth the horse.

    Because it may save the horse from falling, and perhaps losing its
    life. A mere trifle may, at an opportune moment, be of very great
    service.

In a thousand pounds o' law there's no an ounce o' love.

Industry maks a braw man and breaks ill fortune.

I ne'er lo'ed meat that craw'd in my crappie.

    fall; and if I happen to fall into his, I hope he will use me the
    better for giving him good words."

Jeddart justice--first hang a man, syne try him.

    "According to Crawford, in his Memoirs, the phrase _Jedburgh
    justice_ took its rise in 1574, on the occasion of the Regent Morton
    there and then trying and condemning, with cruel precipitation, a
    vast number of people who had offended against the laws, or against
    the supreme cause of his lordship's faction. A different origin is
    assigned by the people. Upon the occasion, say they, of nearly
    twenty criminals being tried for one offence, the jury were equally
    divided in opinion as to a verdict, when one who had been asleep
    during the whole trial suddenly awoke, and, being interrogated for
    his vote, vociferated, 'Hang them a'!'

    "In a remote pastoral region, like that of Cranshaws, lying in the
    midst of the Lammermoor hills, it is or was usual for shepherds'
    dogs to accompany their masters to the church; and in times of
    severe stormy weather, few people except the shepherds, who are
    accustomed to be out in all weathers, could attend divine service;
    and in such circumstances, it may have occurred that the dogs may
    have equalled in number the rational hearers of the Word. We have

parish folk.

    "Hilton kirk was a very small edifice in Berwickshire, and it would
    seem from the saying not very well lighted. When any number of
    strangers came as hearers, the accommodation was deficient; the

Like the bairns o' Falkirk, they'll end ere they mend.

    "This is a proverbial saying of ill-doing persons, as expressive of
    there being no hope of them. How the children of Falkirk came to be
    so characterized, it would be difficult now to ascertain. The adage
    has had the effect of causing the men of Falkirk jocularly to style
    themselves 'the bairns;' and when one of them speaks of another as
    'a bairn,' he only means that that other person is a native of
    Falkirk."--_Robert Chambers._

Like the cat, fain fish wad ye eat, but ye are laith to weet your feet.

    "The cat is fain the fish to eat, but hath no will to wet her

Like the dam o' Devon, lang gathered and soon gane.

Like the fiddler o' Chirnside's breakfast, it's a' pennyworth's
thegither.

    "This is said of people who buy very small quantities of any
    article. Fiddlers are proverbially poor, and the one of Chirnside
    was no exception to the rule. One morning he sent his boy for
    materials for breakfast, and the order was delivered to the
    shopkeeper in the following measured terms:--

      "'A pennyworth o' tea,
      A pennyworth o' sugar,
      Three penny loaves,
      And a pennyworth o' butter;
      And a pennyworth o' he herring,
          For my faither likes melts!'"--_G. Henderson._

Like the gudeman o' Kilpalet, ye're ower simple for this warld, and hae
nae broo o' the next.

Like the laird o' Castlemilk's foals--born beauties.

Like the lassies o' Bayordie, ye learn by the lug.

Like the man o' Amperly's coo, she's come hame routin', but no very fu',
wi' the tow about her horns.

    "The cow came home unsold; and the rhyme is applied to a young woman
    who comes home from a fair or market without a 'jo' or
    sweetheart."--_G. Henderson._

Like the man wi' the sair guts--nae getting quat o't.

Like the smith's dog, sleep at the sound o' the hammer, and wauk at the
crunching o' teeth.

Like the tod's whalps, aye the aulder the waur.

Like the wabster, stealing through the warld.

    Another insult to the weaving profession. The reply of a person who
    is asked how he is getting on.

Like the wife that ne'er cries for the ladle till the pat rins o'er.

    That is, never asks for an article until it is too late.

Like the wife wi' the mony dochters, the best's aye hindmost.

    Or, at least, she would have the lover of the last believe so.

Like the wife's tongue, aften better meant than timed.

Like the witches o' Auchencrow, ye get mair for your ill than your gude.

    "That is, people sometimes grant an individual a favour through fear
    of malevolence, or to get rid of his importunity."--_G. Henderson._

Like to like.

    "I'll tell ye, Ratton, blithe will Nicol Muschat be to see ye, for
    he says he kens weel there isna sic a villain out o' hell as ye are,
    and he wad be ravished to hae a crack wi' ye--like to like, ye
    ken--it's a proverb never fails; and ye are baith a pair o' the
    deevil's peats, I trow--hard to ken whilk deserves the hettest
    corner o' his ingleside."--_Heart of Midlothian._

Like water to leather--the langer the tougher.

    "Although my mither has been, past the memory o' man, in a
    complaining condition, I ken nae odds o' her this many a year; her
    ail's like water to leather, it makes her life the tougher."--_The
    Entail._

Lippen to me, but look to yoursel.

Lips gae, laps gae, drink and pay.

    "If you put your lips to the cup to drink, put your hand to your lap
    to take out your purse."--_Kelly._

Listen at a hole, and ye'll hear news o' yoursel.

List to meat's gude kitchen.

Little and aften fills the purse.

Little can a lang tongue layne.

Little does the puir gude, and as little get they.

Little dogs hae lang tails.

Little folk are soon angry.

    A frequent addition gives the reason--for their heart gets soon to
    their mouth.

Little gear, little care.

Little Jock gets the little dish, and that hauds him lang little.

    "Poor people are poorly served, which prolongs their
    poverty."--_Kelly._

Little kens the auld wife, as she sits by the fire, what the wind is
doing on Hurley-Burley-Swire.

    "Hurle-Burle-Swire is a passage through a ridge of mountains that
    separate Nithsdale from Twadale and Clydsdale: where the mountains
    are so indented one with another that there is a perpetual blowing.
    The meaning is that they who are at ease know little of the trouble
    that others are exposed to."--_Kelly._

Little kent, the less cared for.

Little may an auld horse do if he maunna nicher.

Little meddling maks fair pairting.

Little mense o' the cheeks to bite aff the nose.

    It is bad policy for a person to injure another with whom he is
    intimately connected, or upon whom he is depending.

Little odds between a feast and a fu' wame.

Little said is soon mended, little gear is soon spended.

Little's the light will be seen far in a mirk night.

    "'But the flame!' demanded Ravenswood; 'the broad blaze which might
    have been seen ten miles off--what occasioned that?' 'Hout, awa!
    it's an auld saying and a true, "Little's the light will be seen far
    in a mirk night"--a wheen fern and horse litter that I fired in the
    courtyard, after sending back the loon of a footman.'"--_Bride of
    Lammermoor._

Little to fear when traitors are true.

Little troubles the ee, but less the soul.

Little wats the ill-willy wife what a dinner may haud in.

    Although a wife be very angry and "ill-willy" with her husband in
    private, still in public she should be cautious for obvious reasons,
    one of which is, Kelly says, "That a handsome treat may secure good
    friends and great interest."

Little winning maks a light purse.

Little wit in the head maks muckle travel to the feet.

    People of few resources, or poor imagination, are apt to be put
    about by trifles.

Little wit in the pow that lights the candle at the lowe.

Live in measure, and laugh at the mediciners.

Live upon love, as laverocks do on leeks.

Living at heck and manger.

    To live at "heck and manger" is to fare sumptuously every day, even
    beyond our income.

Lock your door, that you may keep your neighbours honest.

Lo'e me little an' lo'e me lang.

Look before ye loup, ye'll ken better how to light.

      "Luke quhair thou licht befoir thou lowp,
      And slip na certainty for howp,
      Quha gyds thee but begess."--_Cherrie and the Slae._

Loud coos the doo when the hawk's no whistling; loud cheeps the mouse
when the cat's no rustling.

    That is, subordinates take advantage when superiors are out of the
    way. "When the cat's away, the mice will play."--_English._

Loud i' the loan was ne'er a gude milk cow.

    Noisy people, or those who are always boasting of what they can do,
    are seldom so clever even as their neighbours. Kelly says this is "a
    reprimand to noisy girls."

Love and jealousy are sindle sindry.

Love and lairdship's like nae marrows.

    "Marrow," that is, an equal, match, or antagonist.

Love and light winna hide.

Love has nae lack, be the dame e'er sae black.

Love has nae law.

Love is as warm amang cottars as courtiers.

      "The rose blooms gay on shairney brae,
        As weel's in birken shaw;
      And love will lowe in cottage low,
        As weel's in lofty ha'."--_Tannahill._

Love ower het soon cools.

Love your friend and look to yoursel.

Maidens should be mild and meek, quick to hear, and slow to speak.

Maidens should be mim till they're married, and then they may burn
kirks.

    "Spoken often, by way of reflection, when we say that such a one is
    a good-humoured girl, as if you would say, 'Observe how she'll prove
    when she is married.'"--_Kelly._

Maidens' tochers and ministers' stipends are aye less than ca'd.

Maidens want naething but a man, and then they want a'thing.

Mair by luck than gude guiding.

    That is, a person has been successful by mere force of
    circumstances, and by no particular merit of his own.

Mair hamely than welcome.

"Mair haste the waur speed," quo' the tailor to the lang thread.

Mair nice than wise.

Mair pride than pith.

Mair than enough is ower muckle.

Mair than the deil wear a black manteel.

"Mair whistle than woo," quo' the souter when he sheared the sow.

    The saying, "Great cry and little wool," is common to all nations;
    the Scottish version, however, is the most expressive and humorous
    we have met with.

Maister's will is gude wark.

    For the master himself is sure to be pleased with it.

Maistry maws the meadows doun.

    "The captain's a queer hand ... he keeps a high hand ower the
    country, and we couldna deal with the Hielandmen without his
    protection, sin' a' the keys o' the kintray hings at his belt; and
    he's no an ill body in the main; and maistry, ye ken, maws the
    meadows doun."--_Heart of Midlothian._

Mak ae wrang step and down ye gae.

Mak ae pair o' legs worth twa pair o' hands.

    "He freed Rashleigh from my hold, and securing me, notwithstanding
    my struggles, in his own Herculean gripe, he called out, 'Take the
    bent, Mr Rashleigh--make ae pair o' legs worth twa pair o' hands; ye
    hae done that before now.'"--_Rob Roy._

Mak a kiln o't, and creep in at the logie.

    We surmise that this is intended as an advice to a person who has
    become possessed of an article, and does not know what to do with
    it, like the old lady who won the principal prize in the lottery,
    said prize consisting of a live elephant! A "killogie" is, says
    Jamieson, "a vacuity before the fireplace in a kiln for drawing
    air."

Mak a kirk or a mill o't.

    Similar to the preceding proverb. Equivalent to saying such a thing
    is entirely in your own control; you may do what you please with it.

Mak friends o' fremit folk.

Mak hay while the sun shines.

Mak nae bauks in gude bear-land.

    To "bauk" is to leave small strips of land unturned in ploughing.
    Kelly says of this proverb that it is "spoken when it is proposed to
    marry the youngest daughter before the eldest."

Mak nae orts o' gude hay.

    Literally, do not throw aside good hay.

Mak nae toom ruse.

    "Toom ruse" means empty praise, and the proverb signifies that we
    should not praise indiscriminately, or without knowledge of the
    subject.

Mak the best o' a bad bargain.

Mak your wife a gowdspink, and she'll turn a water-wagtail.

    That is, if you indulge a person freely to a certain extent, the
    probability is he will exceed the limits.

Malice is aye mindfu'.

Man proposes, God disposes.

Man's twal is no sae gude as the deil's dizzen.

    No, because "man's twal" is twelve, while the "deil's dizzen" is
    thirteen.

March comes like a lion and gangs like a lamb.

March comes wi' adders' heads and gangs wi' peacocks' tails.

March dust and March win', bleaches as weel as simmer's sun.

March dust and May sun mak corn white and maidens dun.

March water and May sun makes claes clear and maidens dun.

    The explanation of this saying, which belongs to the Mearns, is,
    that water in the month of March is supposed to be of a more
    cleansing quality than in any other month. The same idea is also
    expressed in the following saying:

March water's worth May soap.

March whisquer was ne'er a gude fisher.

Marriage and hanging gae by destiny.

Married folk are like rats in a trap--fain to get ithers in, but fain to
be out themsels.

Marriage wad tame the sea, if a match could be got for her.

      "Of all comforts I miscarried,
      When I played the sot and married:
      'Tis a trap, there's none need doubt on't;
      Those that are in would fain get out on't."--_Tea-Table Miscellany._

Marry abune your match, and get a maister.

Marry for love, and work for siller.

Marry in haste, and repent at leisure.

Marry your son when you will, but your dochter when you can.

Maun-do is a fell fallow.

    "Necessity is a hard master."--_German._

May-be's are no aye honey bees.

    "An answer to them that say, 'Maybe it will fall out so or
    so.'"--_Kelly._

May-be's flee na at this time o' the year.

Maybe's a big book.

Maybe your pat may need my clips.

    Perhaps some day you will be glad of my assistance, although you
    despise it just now.

May birds are aye cheeping.

    This refers to the popular superstition against marrying in the
    month of May, the children of which marriages are said to "die of
    decay."

May he that turns the clod ne'er want a bannock.

Mealy mou'd maidens stand lang at the mill.

Measure twice, cut but ance.

Meat and mass ne'er hindered wark.

    "'Happy will I be to serve you, my gude auld acquaintance,' said the
    clerk; 'but sit you down--sit you down--sit you down, Mrs
    Dods,--meat and mass never hindered wark. Ye are something overcome
    wi' your travel--the spirit canna aye bear through the flesh, Mrs
    Dods.'"--_St Ronan's Well._

Meat and measure mak a' men wise.

Meat feeds, claith cleeds, but breeding maks the man.

Meat is gude, but mense is better.

Men are no to be mete by inches.

Men speak o' the fair as things went there.

    A jocular manner of addressing those who are very particular in
    their manner of speaking.

Mocking's catching.

Money's aye welcome, were it even in a dirty clout.

Money's better than my lord's letter.

Mony a dog has dee'd sin' ye were whelped.

Mony a dog will dee ere you fa' heir.

Mony a frost and mony a thowe, sune makes mony a rotten yowe.

Mony a gude tale is spoilt in the telling.

    "Applied often when a good sermon is ill delivered, to my certain
    knowledge."--_Kelly._

Mony ane for land taks a fool by the hand.

    That is, many marry only for the sake of money and possessions.

Mony ane kens the gude fellow that disna ken the gude fellow's wife.

    The reason being that he is a "gude fellow" only when abroad or in
    the taproom, and not when he is at home.

Mony ane kisses the bairn for love o' the nurse.

    "That is, show their kindness to the companions, friends, or
    relations of those upon whom they have a design, which they hope by
    their influence to effect."--_Kelly._

Mony ane lacks what they would fain hae in their pack.

Mony ane maks an errand to the ha' to bid my leddy good day.

    Or, many occupy themselves with trifles.

Mony ane opens his pack and sells nae wares.

Mony ane's coat saves their doublet.

    "Spoken when clergymen use you saucily, whom, in deference to their

Mony ane ser's a thankless maister.

Mony ane's gear is mony ane's death.

    "Doctor Luther's shoes do not fit every parish priest."--_German._

Mony ane tines the half-merk whinger for the ha'-penny whang.

    This nearly obsolete saying means, literally, loses a sixpenny
    dagger for the sake of a halfpenny thong. "Spoken," says Kelly,
    "when people lose a considerable thing for not being at an
    inconsiderable expense."

Mony ane wad blush to hear what he wadna blush to dae.

Mony ane wad hae been waur had their estates been better.

Mony an honest man needs help that hasna the face to seek it.

"Mony a thing's made for the penny," as the wifie said when she saw the
black man.

Mony a true tale's tauld in jest.

Mony aunts, mony emes, mony kin, but few friends.

    The word "eme" signifies uncle, and the saying--its claims as a
    proverb are small enough--means that a person may have many
    relations but very few friends among them.

Mony care for meal that hae baked bread enough.

    "Spoken against whining, complaining people, who have enough, and
    yet are always making a moan."--_Kelly._

Mony cooks ne'er made gude kail.

Mony fair promises at the marriage-making, but few at the tocher-paying.

    A man may "promise like a merchant and pay like a man-of-war's-man;"
    that is, promise anything that may be asked, for the sake of
    concluding a bargain, but which, once made, he is in no haste to
    perform.

Mony gude-nights is laith away.

    "He shakes hands often who is loath to go."--_French._

Mony hands maks light work.

Mony littles mak a muckle.

Mony purses haud friends lang thegither.

Mony rains, mony rowans; mony rowans, mony yewns.

    "Yewns being light grain. The rowans are the fruit of the mountain
    ash, which never are ripe till harvest. It is a common observation,
    that an abundance of them generally follows a wet season."--_Robert
    Chambers._

Mony sae "weel" when it ne'er was waur.

    "Spoken to them that say 'well' by way of resentment."--_Kelly._

Mony time I hae got a wipe wi' a towel, but ne'er a daub wi' a dishclout
before.

    Or reprimanded by a person who had authority to do so, but never
    roughly handled by one who had no right to interfere. Kelly says
    this is "spoken by saucy girls when one jeers them with an unworthy
    sweetheart."

Mony ways to kill a dog though ye dinna hang him.

Mony words dinna fill the firlot.

    A "firlot" is a fourth part of a boll, dry measure. Equivalent to
    the proverb, "Many words go to a sackful."--_Dutch._

Mony words, muckle drouth.

Mony wyte their wife for their ain thriftless life.

    That is, many persons blame others for what are the consequences of
    their own faults. Kelly says, "I never saw a Scottish woman who had
    not this at her finger's end."

Mouths are nae measure.

    The Irish are not of this opinion, for it is recorded that one of
    them said his mouth held exactly a glass of whisky--that is, if he
    could have retained it; but there was a hole in the bottom of it
    which continually prevented him from proving the fact.

Mows may come to earnest.

    "To 'mow,' to speak in mockery."--_Jamieson._

Moyen does muckle, but money does mair.

    Influence or interest does much, but money will do more.

Muck and money gae thegither.

Muckleness is no manliness.

Muckle pleasure, some pain.

Muckle power maks mony faes.

Muckle skaith comes to the shae before the heat comes to the tae.

Muckle spoken, part spilt.

    So much was said on a subject that a great deal was lost.

Muckle wad aye hae mair.

    of Strafford and Archbishop Laud."

Naething's a bare man.

    "A jocose answer to children when they say they have gotten

Naething sae bauld as a blind mear.

Naething sooner maks a man auld-like than sitting ill to his meat.

    "To sit ill to one's meat, to be ill fed."--_Jamieson._

Naething to be done in haste but gripping fleas.

    In his introduction to Henderson's _Proverbs_, Motherwell relates a
    humorous anecdote in connection with this proverb. An indefatigable
    collector of "rusty sayed saws," a friend of his, was in the habit
    of jotting down any saying new to him on the back of cards, letters,
    &c., and thrusting them into his pocket. On one occasion he had an
    altercation with a stranger at a friend's house. The quarrel
    becoming warm, ended by Motherwell's friend excitedly handing the
    other (as he thought) his card. On the gentleman's preparing to
    vindicate his honour next morning, it occurred to him to learn the
    name of his antagonist. On looking at the card he found no name,
    but, in place of it, traced in good legible characters, "Naething
    should be done in a hurry but catching fleas." The effect of this
    was irresistible, and the result an immediate reconciliation.

Naething to do but draw in your stool and sit down.

    Everything is so far advanced that the finishing stroke only is
    wanting. Applied to a man who is courting a widow or spinster
    already in possession of a well-furnished house.

Naething venture, naething win.

Nae weather's ill an the wind be still.

Nae wonder ye're auld like, ilka thing fashes you.

    That is, because you allow every little trifling occurrence to vex
    you.

Nane are sae weel but they hope to be better.

Nane but fools and knaves lay wagers.

    Henderson, in his _Proverbs_, reads "poets" for "fools," possibly as
    a hit upon some of his friends, several of whom were poets of local
    celebrity.

Nane can mak a bore but ye'll find a pin for't.

    Meaning that none can find fault with you but you will be able to
    give an excuse for it. "As soon find hare without a mense as you
    without excuse."--_English._

Nane can play the fool sae weel as a wise man.

Nane can tell what's i' the shaup till it's shelt.

    That is, in the husk until it is shelled.

Nane kens whaur a blister may light.

Narrow gathered, widely spent.

Nature passes nurture.

Nearer e'en the mair beggars.

Nearer God's blessing than Carlisle fair.

    "You need but go to your closet for the one, but you must go out of
    the kingdom for the other."--_Kelly._

Nearer the bane, sweeter the flesh.

    "And for eating--what signifies telling a lee? there's just the
    hinder end of the mutton-ham that has been but three times on the
    table, and the nearer the bane the sweeter, as your honours weel
    ken; and--there's the heel of the ewe-milk kebbuck, wi' a bit o'
    nice butter, and--and--that's a' that's to trust to."--_Bride of
    Lammermoor._

Nearer the rock, the sweeter the grass.

Nearest the heart, nearest the mou.

    "Spoken to them who, designing to name one person, by mistake names
    another, perhaps a sweetheart."--_Kelly._

Nearest the king, nearest the widdy.

    "Widdy," rope or gallows. Meaning that those who occupy political or
    subservient positions do so only during the pleasure of their
    superiors.

Near's my kirtle, but nearer's my sark.

Near's my sark, but nearer's my skin.

    The two last sayings are common to many nations. "Some friends are
    nearer to me than others--my parents and children than my other
    relations, those than my neighbours, my neighbours than strangers;
    but, above all, I am next to myself."--_Ray._

Near the kirk, but far frae grace.

    This fact is so well ascertained that there is another to the same
    effect. "Farthest frae the kirk aye soonest at it;" and the English
    are of a similar opinion, for Spenser writes:

      "At kirke the narre from God more farre,
      Has been an old sayed sawe."

Necessity has nae law.

Necessity's the mither o' invention.

Neck or naething, the king lo'es nae cripples.

    "A prophane jest upon those who are like to fall, wishing that they
    may either break their neck or come off safe; for breaking a limb
    will make them useless subjects."--_Kelly._

Need gars naked men run, and sorrow gars wabsters spin.

    "Hunger drives the wolf out of the wood."--_Italian._ In the second
    clause we have another discreditable imputation on the weaving
    fraternity, implying that they only work when compelled by hunger,
    and are not naturally industrious.

Need gars the auld wife trot.

    "'This is your mother, is it not?' (Cuddie nodded.) 'What can have
    brought your mother and you down the water so late?' 'Troth, stir,
    just what gars the auld wives trot--neshessity, stir. I'm seeking
    for service, stir.'"--_Old Mortality._

Need maks a man o' craft.

Need maks greed.

Need maks the naked quean spin.

Ne'er break out o' kind to gar your friends ferlie at you.

    Do not do strange acts merely for the sake of astonishing your
    friends.

Ne'er count the lawin' wi' a toom quaich.

    "Quaich," a small and shallow drinking-cup with two ears. The
    proverb has a similar meaning to "Fair fa' the wife," &c., _q. v._

Ne'er do ill that gude may come o't.

Ne'er draw your dirk when a dunt will do.

    That is, do not resort to extreme measures when mild means will
    suffice.

Ne'er fash your beard.

    "'Tell them all this, and hear what they say till't.'

    "'Indeed, mistress, I can tell ye that already, without stirring my
    shanks for the matter,' answered Nelly Trotter; 'they will e'en say
    that ye are ae auld fule, and me anither, that may hae some judgment
    in cock-bree or in scate-rumples, but maunna fash our beards about
    onything else.'"--_St Ronan's Well._

Ne'er fash your thoom.

      "Ne'er mind her flytes, but set your heart at ease:
      Sit down and blaw your pipe, nor fash your thoom,
      An' there's my hand, she'll tire, and soon sing dumb."--_Fergusson._

Ne'er find faut wi' my shoon, unless you pay my souter.

    Addressed to impertinent persons who find fault with the personal
    appearance or dress of others.

Ne'er gang to the deil wi' the dishclout on your head.

    "If you will be a knave, be not in a trifle, but in something of
    value. A Presbyterian minister had a son who was made Archdeacon of
    Ossery; when this was told to his father, he said, 'If my son will
    be a knave, I am glad that he will be an archknave.' This has the
    same sense, 'As good be hanged for an old sheep as a young
    lamb.'"--_Kelly._

Ne'er gie me my death in a toom dish.

    This means, jocularly, if you wish to kill me, do it not by
    starvation; in other words, give me something to eat.

Ne'er gude, egg nor bird.

Ne'er kiss a man's wife, or dight his knife, for he'll do baith after
you.

Ne'er let on, but laugh in your sleeve.

Ne'er let the nose blush for the sins o' the mouth.

Ne'er let your feet rin faster than your shoon.

    "'But you must recollect, that before taking such a step you ought
    to be pretty well provided with means.'

    "'Ou', fegs! I hae nae trick o' letting my feet rin faster than my
    shoon. I'll no forget the means, ye may be sure; and as for Jean
    hersel, I hae nae skill o' women folk, if she's no just as willing
    as me.'"--_The Disruption._

Ne'er lippen ower muckle to a new friend or an auld enemy.

Ne'er marry a penniless maiden that's proud o' her pedigree.

Ne'er marry a widow unless her first man was hanged.

Ne'er misca' a Gordon in the raws o' Stra'bogie.

    The Gordons were the ruling clan in Strathbogie; and the proverb
    means that we should never speak ill of a man on his own property.

Ne'er put your arm out farther than you can draw it easily back again.

    "The deacon used to say to me, 'Nick--young Nick' (his name was
    Nicol as well as mine, sae folk ca'd us, in their daffin, young Nick
    and auld Nick)--'Nick,' said he, 'never put out your arm farther
    than ye can draw it easily back again.'"--_Rob Roy._

Ne'er ower auld to learn.

Ne'er put a sword in a wudman's hand.

Ne'er speak ill o' the deil.

Ne'er speak ill o' them whase bread ye eat.

Ne'er spend gude siller looking for bad.

    "John had never before taken any debtor to law, his motto being,
    'Never spend gude siller looking for bad;' but in this case, he
    said, he was determined to roup them to the door, although it
    shouldna put a penny in his pouch."--_Roy's "Generalship."_

Ne'er strive against the stream.

Ne'er tak a forehammer to break an egg.

Ne'er tell your fae when your fit sleeps.

Ne'er throw the bridle o' your horse ower a fool's arm.

Ne'er use the taws when a gloom will do.

    Of similar import to "Ne'er draw your dirk," _q. v._

Ne'er was a wife weel pleased coming frae the mill but ane, and she brak
her neck bane.

    Kelly says this is "commonly said to wives when they come from the
    mill, but the occasion, sense, or meaning I know not." Is it not
    because they are always dissatisfied with the "mouter" which the
    miller takes?

Ne'er waur happen you than your ain prayer.

Neither fish, flesh, fowl, nor gude red herring.

    Used to signify that an article is good for nothing.

Neither sae sinfu' as to sink nor sae holy as to soom.

Never's a lang word.

New lairds mak new laws.

    "They were decent, considerate men, that didna plague a puir herd
    callant muckle about a moorfowl or a mawkin, unless he turned common
    fowler--Sir Robert Ringhorse used to say, the herd lads shot as mony
    gleds and pyots as they did game. But new lords new laws--naething
    but fine and imprisonment, and the game no a feather the
    plentier."--_St Ronan's Well._

Next to nae wife, a gude ane's best.

Nineteen naesays o' a maiden is half a grant.

      "Her laugh will lead you to the place,
        Where lies the happiness ye want;
      And plainly tell you to your face,
        Nineteen nae-says are half a grant."--_Tea-Table Miscellany._

Nipping and scarting's Scotch folk's wooing.

    "It may be Scotch folk's wooing; but if that's the gait Betty Bodle
    means to use you, Watty, my dear, I would see her, and a' the
    Kilmarkeckles that ever were cleckit, doon the water, or strung in a
    wuddy, before I would hae onything to say to ane come o' their seed
    or breed. To lift her hands to her bridegroom!"--_The Entail._

    "Aith," or oath, is here used in the sense of promise, signifying
    that from "ill debtors" men get not money but promises, which, of
    course, are never performed.

Oh for a drap o' gentle blude, that I may wear black abune my brow.

    "In Scotland no woman is suffered to wear a silk hood unless she be
    a gentlewoman; that is, a gentleman's daughter, or married to a
    gentleman. A rich maid having the offer of a wealthy yeoman, or a
    bare gentleman, wished for the last, to qualify her to wear a black
    hood. It is since spoken to such wealthy maidens upon the like
    occasion."--_Kelly._

It's weel kenn'd your faither's son was ne'er a scambler.

    This proverb is, we think, fairly entitled to rank as the second
    longest on record, the first being, as recorded by Trench, the
    German one, "Folk say there is a lack of four people on earth," &c.
    Kelly says that "this was a speech of a countrywoman of mine to a
    guest that she would gladly have shaken off, and being so oddly
    expressed it became a proverb, which we repeat when we think our
    friend does not entertain us heartily."

Out o' debt, out o' danger.

Out o' God's blessing into the warm sun.

Out o' Davy Lindsay into Wallace.

    "Davy Lindsay and Wallace" were two books formerly used in schools;
    and the proverb is used when a person changes, or, more properly,
    advances from one thing to another.

Out on the highgate is aye fair play.

Out o' sight, out o' languor.

    "Long absent, soon forgotten."--_English._

Out o' the peat pot into the gutter.

    "Out of the frying pan into the fire."--_English._

    "Out of the mire into the brook."--_Spanish._

Out o' the warld and into Kippen.

    Kippen, in Stirlingshire, was formerly so very remote and little
    frequented by strangers, that a visit to it was jocularly deemed
    equivalent to going out of the world altogether; and the remark
    passed into a proverb, used when a person is going to a strange
    place. The feudal lord of this district was formerly styled King of
    Kippen.

Own debt and crave days.

Ower braw a purse to put a plack in.

    That is, externally grander or more showy than internal means

Ower mony cooks spoil the broth.

Ower mony grieves hinder the wark.

    Spoken when a person has too many projects in hand; meaning that
    some must fail.

"Ower mony maisters," quo' the puddock to the harrow, when ilka tooth
gied her a tug.

Ower muckle hameliness spoils gude courtesy.

    "Too much familiarity breeds contempt."--_English._

Ower muckle loose leather about your chafts.

    A rude but expressive way of saying that a person is not looking
    well, or is, _Scotice_, "thin."

Ower muckle cookery spoils the brochan.

Ower muckle o' ae thing is gude for naething.

Ower narrow counting culyes nae kindness.

    To "culye" is to gain, to draw forth. "When people deal in rigour
    with us we think ourselves but little obliged to them."--_Kelly._

Ower reckless may repent.

Ower sicker, ower loose.

    Or, you are either too harsh and stringent, or the very reverse.

Ower strong meat for your weak stamack.

Ower sune is easy mended.

Patch and lang sit, build and soon flit.

    A slow and gradual rise is likely to prove a permanent one; but a

Pay-before-hand's never weel ser'd.

    The tradesman is said to be troubled with two kinds of bad
    customers, viz., those who pay in advance, or "before-hand," and
    those who do not pay at all.

Pay him in his ain coin.

Pennyless souls maun pine in purgatory.

Penny-wheep's gude enough for muslin-kail.

    "Penny-wheep," says Jamieson, "is the weakest kind of small beer,
    sold at a _penny_ per bottle;" and muslin-kail is a common kind of
    broth. The proverb expresses that poor service merits poor reward.

Poets and painters are aye poor.

    This appears in no collection preceding Henderson's, and is probably
    a record of his own experience and that of his friends, he being a
    painter himself by profession, and on intimate terms with Motherwell
    and others.

Poets and painters hae liberty to lo'e.

Poor folk are fain o' little.

Poor folk maun fit their wame to their winning.

Poor folk seek meat for their stamacks, and rich folk stamacks for their

Poor folk's friends soon misken them.

Poortith pairts gude company.

Poortith's better than pride.

Poortith's pain, but nae disgrace.

Poortith taks awa pith.

    "'I tell you, Master Moniplies,' said Jenkin, 'I am as poor as any
    Scot among you. I have broken my indenture, and I think of running
    the country.' 'A-well-a-day!' said Ritchie. 'But that maunna be,

Pretty man, I maun say; tak a peat and sit down.

    We are unable to make much either of this proverb or of Kelly's note
    to it--"An ironical expression to a mean boy who would gladly be
    esteemed."

Pride and grace ne'er dwell in ae place.

Pride an' sweer'dness need muckle uphaudin.

    "Sweer'd," lazy or unwilling. Pride and laziness require much to
    support them.

Pride finds nae cauld.

    "Spoken heretofore to young women when, in compliance with the
    fashion, they went with their breasts and shoulders bare; and may
    now (1721) be applied to ladies with their extravagant
    hoops."--_Kelly._

Pride ne'er leaves its maister till he get a fa'.

Pride prinks her brow for the deil to pouse.

    That is, pride bedecks herself, and the devil despoils.

Pride's an ill horse to ride.

Pride that dines wi' vanity sups wi' contempt.

Pride will hae a fa'.

Ye're like the dead folk o' Earlstoun--no to lippen to.

    "This is founded on a popular story, kept up as a joke against the
    worthy people of Earlstoun. It is said that an inhabitant of this
    village, going home with too much liquor, stumbled into the
    churchyard, where he soon fell asleep. Wakening to a glimmering
    consciousness after a few hours, he felt his way across the graves;
    but taking every hollow interval for an open receptacle for the
    dead, he was heard by some neighbour saying to himself, 'Up and

    replied Andrew pawkily, 'to tak the first word o' flyting; but ye

    other person to speak ill of them in her hearing. 'They were daft
    callants,' she said, 'and that was all--when the drink was in, the
    wit was out; ye could not put an auld head upon young shouthers; a
    young cowt will canter, be it up hill or down--and what for no?' was
    her uniform conclusion."--_St Ronan's Well._

Young ducks may be auld geese.

    "A man at five may be a fool at fifteen."

Young folk may dee, auld folk maun dee.

Young saints, auld sinners.

    "'I hae played wi' him mysel at Glennaquoich, and sae has Vich Ian
    Vohr, often of a Sunday afternoon.' 'Lord forgie ye, Ensign
    MacCombich,' said the alarmed Presbyterian; 'I'm sure the colonel
    wad never do the like o' that.' 'Hout! hout! Mrs Flockhart,' replied
    the Ensign, 'we're young blude, ye ken; and young saints, auld
    deils.'"--_Waverley._

Your bread's baked, you may hing up your girdle.

Your een's greedier than your guts.

    This is applied to persons who leave a "rough" plate--who, having
    asked for a dish, are unable to finish it.

Your een's no marrows.

Your een's your merchant.

Your fortune's coming wi' the blind carrier.

    "Deed, Mr Stimperton, I'm no sae daft. Whaur wad the profit o' that
    be, I wonder? I trow, the principal and interest wad come back to
    me wi' the blind carrier. Set my nevo up wi' my hard won siller,
    truly!"--_The Disruption._

Your head canna get up but your stamach follows.

Your mind's aye chasing mice.

Your mou's beguiled your hands.

Your purse was steekit when that was paid for.

    A polite manner of intimating that the article in question has not
    been paid.

Your tongue is nae scandal.

Your tongue rins aye before your wit.

Your tongue wags like a lamb's tail.

Your thrift's as gude as the profit o' a yeld hen.

"Your will's law," quo' the tailor to the clockin' hen, when she pick'd
oot his twa een, and cam for his nose.

Your wit will ne'er worry you.

Yule is young on Yule even, and auld on Saint Steven.

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
