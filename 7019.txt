INTRODUCTION

Friendship is essentially the same bond, whether it unites persons of
intellect and refined tastes, or those more unfortunate ones, who,
perhaps, have no conception of their mission in the world, or of their
duty to society. Its manifestations may be wholly different, but the two
friendships will have some points in common. In both instances the
friends are drawn close together and are united by that bond which has
been so beautifully written about throughout the ages.

The abstract theorizing of one philosopher can never satisfy the
individual in regard to the varied manifestations of friendship, and it
is therefore interesting and profitable to note what various writers
have said about this world-wide force under the varying conditions of
the past and the present. It would be a well-nigh hopeless task to
attempt to gather within the compass of a single volume all that has
been written about it. The present volume present some selections that
express in a measure what is implied by the word Friendship.



For Auld Lang Syne

It is a noble and great thing to cover the blemishes and to excuse the
failings of a friend; to draw a curtain before his stains, and to
display his perfections; to bury his weaknesses in silence, but to
proclaim his virtues upon the housetop.

--_South_.

       *       *       *       *       *

  E'en as a traveller, meeting with the shade
  Of some o'erhanging tree, awhile reposes,
  Then leaves its shelter to pursue his way,
  So men meet friends, then part with them forever.

--_Hitopadesa_.

       *       *       *       *       *

A true friendship is as wise as it is tender.

--_Thoreau_.

       *       *       *       *       *

As ships meet at sea--a moment together, when words of greeting must be
spoken, and then away upon the deep--so men meet in this world; and I
think we should cross no man's path without hailing him, and if he
needs, giving him supplies.

--_H. W. Beecher_.

       *       *       *       *       *

A friend is more necessary than either fire or water.

--_Proverbs_.

       *       *       *       *       *

A long novitiate of acquaintance should precede the vows of friendship.

--_Lord Bolingbroke_.

       *       *       *       *       *

A beloved friend does not fill one part of the soul, but, penetrating
the whole, becomes connected with all feeling.

--_Channing_.

       *       *       *       *       *

A reverse of fortune is a mighty sifter of friendship. So is distance.
Go a little way out of town, and see how many people will take the
trouble to come to see you. Well, we must be patient and forbearing. It
is a question of intensity of need. Friendly relations depend upon
vicinity amongst other things, and there are degrees; but the best kind
of friendship has a way of bridging time and space for all that.

--_Haweis_.

       *       *       *       *       *

A female friend, amiable, clever, and devoted, is a possession more
valuable than parks and palaces; and without such a muse few men can
succeed in life, none be contented.

--_Lord Beaconsfield_.

       *       *       *       *       *

A true friend embraces our objects as his own. We feel another mind bent
on the same end, enjoying it, ensuring it, reflecting it, and delighting
in our devotion to it.

--_Channing_.

       *       *       *       *       *

A pretended affection is not easily distinguished from a real one,
unless in seasons of distress. For adversity is to friendship what fire
is to gold--the only infallible test to discover the genuine from the
counterfeit. In all other cases they both have the same common marks.

--_Cicero_.

       *       *       *       *       *

  A little peaceful home bounds all my wants and wishes;
  Add to this my book and friend--and this is happiness supreme.

--_Montaigne_.

       *       *       *       *       *

A true friend is more precious to the soul than all which it inherits
beneath the sun.

--_Irving_.

       *       *       *       *       *

  A friend
  Welded into our life is more to us
  Than twice five-thousand kinsmen, one in blood.

--_Euripides_.

       *       *       *       *       *

A principal fruit of friendship is the ease and discharge of the
fullness and swelling of the heart, which passions of all kinds do cause
and induce. No receipt openeth the heart but a true friend, to whom you
may impart griefs, joys, fears, hopes, suspicions, counsels, and
whatsoever lieth upon the heart to oppress it, in a kind of civil shrift
or confession.

--_Bacon_.

       *       *       *       *       *

Be true to thy friend. Never speak of his faults to another, to show thy
own discrimination; but open them all to him, with candor and true
gentleness; forgive all his errors and his sins, be they ever so many;
but do not excuse the slightest deviation from rectitude. Never forbear
to dissent from a false opinion, or a wrong practice, from mistaken
motives of kindness; nor seek thus to have thy own weaknesses sustained;
for these things cannot be done without injury to the soul.

--_Child_.

       *       *       *       *       *

Be admonished not to strike leagues of friendship with cheap persons,
where no friendship can be.

--_Emerson_.

       *       *       *       *       *

  A day for toil, an hour for sport,
  But for a friend life is too short.

--_Emerson_.

       *       *       *       *       *

After a certain age a new friend is a wonder. There is the age of
blossoms and sweet budding green, the age of generous summer, the autumn
when the leaves drop, and then winter shivering and bare.

--_Thackeray_.

       *       *       *       *       *

Bitter and unrelenting enemies often deserve better of us than those
friends whom we are inclined to regard as pleasant companions; the
former often tell us the truth, the latter never.

--_Cicero_.

       *       *       *       *       *

Does friendship really go on to be more pain than pleasure? I doubt it,
for even in its deepest sorrows there is a joy which makes ordinary
pleasure a very poor, meaningless affair.

--_Unknown_.

       *       *       *       *       *

Friendship does not spring up and grow great and become perfect all at
once, but requires time and the nourishment of thoughts.

--_Dante_.

       *       *       *       *       *

Even the utmost good-will and harmony and practical kindness are not
sufficient for friendship, for friends do not live in harmony, merely,
as some say, but in melody. We do not wish for friends to feed and
clothe our bodies,--neighbors are kind enough for that,--but to do the
like office to our spirits. For this, few are rich enough, however well
disposed they may be.

--_Thoreau_.

       *       *       *       *       *

A pure friendship inspires, cleanses, expands, and strengthens the soul.

--_Alger_.

       *       *       *       *       *

A friend is he that loves, and he that is beloved.

--_Hobbe_.

       *       *       *       *       *

  Change, care, nor Time while life endure
  Shall spoil our ancient friendship sure.

--_Lang_.

       *       *       *       *       *

Every young man is the better for cherishing strong friendships with the
wise and good; and he whose soul is knit to one or more chosen
associates with whom he can sympathize in right aims and feelings, is
thereby the better armed against temptation and confirmed in paths of
virtue.

--_Carlyle_.

       *       *       *       *       *

  Believing hear, what you deserve to hear:
  Your birthday, as my own, to me is dear.
  Blest and distinguished days! which we should prize
  The first, the kindest, bounty of the skies.
  But yours gives most; for mine did only lend
  Me to the world, yours gave to me a friend.

--_Martial_.

       *       *       *       *       *

Choose for your friend him that is wise and good, and secret and just,
ingenious and honest, and in those things which have a latitude, use
your own liberty.

--_Taylor_.

       *       *       *       *       *

Friendship is made up of esteem and pleasure; pity is composed of sorrow
and contempt: the mind may for some time fluctuate between them, but it
can never entertain both at once.

--_Goldsmith_.

       *       *       *       *       *

Friends are much better tried in bad fortune than in good fortune.

--_Aristotle_.

       *       *       *       *       *

Fellowship of souls does not consist in the proximity of persons.  There
are millions who live in close personal contact--dwell under the same
roof, board at the same table, and work in the same shop--between whose
minds there is scarcely a point of contact, whose souls are as far
asunder as the poles; whilst, contrariwise, there are those separated by
oceans and continents, ay, by the mysterious gulf that divides time from
eternity, between whom there is a constant intercourse, a delightful
fellowship. In truth, we have often more communion with the distant than
the near.

--_Dr. Thomas_.

       *       *       *       *       *

Friendship must live by faith and not by sight.

--_Eliot_.

       *       *       *       *       *

Friends should not be chosen to flatter. The quality we should prize is
that rectitude which will shrink from no truth. Intimacies, which
increase vanity, destroy friendship.

--_Channing_.

       *       *       *       *       *

Favors, and especially pecuniary ones, are generally fatal to
friendship; for our pride will ever prompt us to lower the value of the
gift by diminishing that of the donor. Ingratitude is an effort to
recover our own esteem by getting rid of our esteem for our benefactor,
whom we look upon as a sort of tooth-drawer, that has cured us of one
pain by inflicting another.

--_Smith_.

       *       *       *       *       *

Friendship throws a greater lustre on prosperity, while it lightens
adversity by sharing in its griefs and anxieties.

--_Cicero_.

       *       *       *       *       *

Friendship hath the skill and observation of the best physician; the
diligence and vigilance of the best nurse; and the tenderness and
patience of the best mother.

--_Lord Clarendon_.

       *       *       *       *       *

  Friendship! the precious gold of life
    By age refined, yet ever new;
  Tried in the crucible of time
    It always rings of service true.

  Friendship! the beauteous soul of life
    Which gladdens youth and strengthens age;
  May it our hearts and lives entwine
    Together on life's fleeting page.

--_Shaylor_.

       *       *       *       *       *

Friendship is the shadow of the evening, which strengthens with the
setting sun of life.

--_La Fontaine_.

       *       *       *       *       *

Friendship, love, and piety, ought to be handled with a sort of
mysterious secrecy; they ought to be spoken of only in the rare moments
of perfect confidence.

--_Novalis_.

       *       *       *       *       *

Few men are calculated for that close connection which we distinguish by
the name of friendship, and we well know the difference between a friend
and an acquaintance.

--_Sterne_.

       *       *       *       *       *

Friendship is the nearest thing we know to what religion is. God is
love.  And to make religion akin to friendship is simply to give it the
highest expression conceivable by man.

--_Drummond_.

       *       *       *       *       *

Friendship is the great chain of human society.

--_Howell_.

       *       *       *       *       *

Friendship is an allay of our sorrows, the ease of our passions, the
discharge of our oppressions, the sanctuary to our calamities, the
counsellor of our doubts, the charity of our minds, the emission of our
thoughts, the exercise and improvement of what we meditate.

--_Taylor_.

       *       *       *       *       *

Friendship springs up from sources so subtile and undefinable, that it
cannot be _forced_ into particular channels; and whenever the
attempt has been made, it has usually been unsuccessful.

--_Day_.

       *       *       *       *       *

  God wills that we have sorrows here,
    And we will share it;
  Whisper thy sorrow in my ear,
    That I may also bear it.
  If anywhere our trouble seems
    To find an end,
  'Tis in the fairy land of dreams,
    Or with a friend.

--_Tennyson_.

       *       *       *       *       *

Friendship is a union of spirits, a marriage of hearts, and the bond
thereof virtue.

--_Penn_.

       *       *       *       *       *

Friendship that makes the least noise is very often the most useful; for
which reason I should prefer a prudent friend to a zealous one.

--_Addison_.

       *       *       *       *       *

  Friendship, like love, is but a name
  Unless to one you stint the flame.
  The child, whom many fathers share,
  Hath seldom known a father's care.
  'Tis thus in friendships; who depends
  On many, rarely finds a friend.

--_Gay_.

       *       *       *       *       *

  Friend is a word of royal tone;
  Friend is a poem all alone.

--_From the Persian_.

       *       *       *       *       *

Get not your friends by bare compliments, but by giving them sensible
tokens of your love. It is well worth while to learn how to win the
heart of man the right way. Force is of no use to make or preserve a
friend, who is an animal that is never caught and tamed but by kindness
and pleasure. Excite them by your civilities, and show them that you
desire nothing more than their satisfaction; oblige with all your soul
that friend who has made you a present of his own.

--_Socrates_.

       *       *       *       *       *

He who gives pleasure, meets with it; kindness is the bond of
friendship, and the book of love; he who sows not, reaps not.

       *       *       *       *       *

  Friendship is the holiest of gifts,
  God can bestow nothing more sacred upon us!
  It enhances every joy, mitigates every pain.
  Everyone can have a friend
  Who himself knows how to be a friend.

--_Teidge_.

       *       *       *       *       *

In this respect friendship is superior to relationship, because from
relationship benevolence can be withdrawn, and from friendship it
cannot; for with the withdrawal of benevolence the very name of
friendship is done away, while that of relationship remains.

--_Cicero_.

       *       *       *       *       *

  I want a warm and faithful friend,
    To cheer the adverse hour;
  Who ne'er to flatter will descend,
    Nor bend the knee to power.
  A friend to chide me when I'm wrong,
    My inmost soul to see;
  And that my friendship prove as strong
    To him as his to me.

--_Adams_.

       *       *       *       *       *

  Friendship's true laws are by this rule expressed,
  Welcome the coming, speed the parting guest.

--_Pope_.

       *       *       *       *       *

Human spirits are only to be drawn together and held together by the
living bond of having found something in which they really do agree.

--_Greenwell_.

       *       *       *       *       *

  He has the substance of all bliss
  To whom a virtuous friend is given:
  So sweet harmonious friendship is,
  Add but eternity, you'll make it heaven.

--_Norris_.

       *       *       *       *       *

  He who wrongs his friend
  Wrongs himself more and ever bears about
  A silent court of justice in his breast.

--_Tennyson_.

       *       *       *       *       *

  Hearts only thrive on varied good,
    And he who gathers from a host
  Of friendly hearts his daily food,
    Is the best friend that we can boast.

--_Holland_.

       *       *       *       *       *

I exhort you to lay the foundations of virtue, without which friendship
cannot exist, in such a manner that, with this one exception, you may
consider that nothing in the world is more excellent than friendship.

--_Cicero_.

       *       *       *       *       *

It is a beautiful thing to feel that our friends are God's gifts to us.
Thinking of it has made me understand why we love and are loved,
sometimes when we cannot explain what causes the feeling. Feeling so
makes friendship such a sacred, holy thing!

--_Porter_.

       *       *       *       *       *

If my brother, or kinsman, will be my friend, I ought to prefer him
before a stranger; or I show little duty or nature to my parents.

And as we ought to prefer our kindred in point of affection, so, too, in
point of charity, if equally needing and deserving.

--_Penn_.

       *       *       *       *       *

It is equally impossible to forget our friends, and to make them answer
to our ideal. When they say farewell, then indeed we begin to keep them
company.  How often we find ourselves turning our backs on our actual
friends that we may go out and meet their ideal cousins!

--_Thoreau_.

       *       *       *       *       *

I must feel pride in my friend's accomplishments as if they were
mine--wild, delicate, throbbing property in his virtues. I feel as
warmly when he is praised as the lover when he hears applause of his
engaged maiden.

--_Emerson_.

       *       *       *       *       *

In very many cases of friendship, or what passes for it, the old axiom
is reversed, and like clings to unlike more than to like.

--_Dickens_.

       *       *       *       *       *

Hearts are linked to hearts by God.  The friend on whose fidelity you
can count, whose success in life flushes your cheek with honest
satisfaction, whose triumphant career you have traced and read with a
heart throbbing almost as if it were a thing alive, for whose honor you
would answer as for your own; that friend, given to you by circumstances
over which you have no control, was God's own gift.

--_Robertson_.

       *       *       *       *       *

If thou neglect thy love to thy neighbor, in vain thou professest thy
love to God.

--_Quarles_.

       *       *       *       *       *

I cannot contentedly frame a prayer for myself in particular, without a
catalogue for my friends; nor request a happiness, wherein my sociable
disposition doth not desire the fellowship of my neighbor.

--_Browne_.

       *       *       *       *       *

  It's  an owercome  sooth  for  age  an' youth
    And it brooks wi' nae denial,
  That the dearest friends are the auldest friends
    And the young are just on trial.

  There's a rival bauld wi' young an' auld
    And it's him that has bereft me;
  For the surest friends are the auldest friends
    And the maist o' mine hae left me.

  There are kind hearts still, for friends to fill
    And fools to take and break them;
  But the nearest friends are the auldest friends
    And the grave's the place to seek them.

--_Stevenson_.

       *       *       *       *       *

God divided man into men that they might help each other.

--_Seneca_.

       *       *       *       *       *

I sometimes hear my friends complain finely that I do not appreciate
their fineness. I shall not tell them whether I do or not. As if they
expected a vote of thanks for every fine thing which they uttered or
did! Who knows but it was finely appreciated? It may be that your
silence was the finer thing of the two....  In human intercourse the
tragedy begins, not when there is misunderstanding about words, but when
silence is not understood. Then there can never be an explanation.

--_Thoreau_.

       *       *       *       *       *

It is essential to friendship that there be no labor to pass for more
than we are, no effort, no anxiety to hide! If anything be concealed,
the constant intercourse of friends will discover it, and one discovery
will produce others. The idea that the heart has one secret fold
extinguishes affection.

Impatient and uncertain lovers think that they must say or do something

It has seemed to me lately more possible than I knew, to carry a
friendship greatly, on one side, without due correspondence on the
other. Why should I cumber myself with the poor fact that the receiver
is not capacious? It never troubles the sun that some of his rays fall
wide and vain into ungrateful space, and only a small part on the
reflecting planet....  It is thought a disgrace to love unrequited. But
the great will see that true love cannot be unrequited.

Let this, therefore, be established as a primary law concerning

Life to be rich and fertile must be reinforced with friendship. It is
the sap that preserves from blight and withering; it is the sunshine
that beckons on the blossoming and fruitage; it is the starlight dew
that perfumes life with sweetness and besprinkles it with splendor; it
is the music-tide that sweeps the soul, scattering treasures; it is the
victorious and blessed leader of integrity's forlorn hope; it is the
potent alchemy that transmutes failure into success; it is the hidden
manna that nourishes when all other sustenance fails; it is the voice
that speaks to hopes all dead, "Because I live, ye shall live also." For
the loftiest friendships have no commercial element in them: they are
founded on disinterestedness and sacrifices. They neither expect nor
desire a return for gift or service. Amid the tireless breaking of the
billows on the shores of experience, there is no surer anchorage than a
friendship that "beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all
things."

Sweet words will multiply a man's friends; and a fair-speaking tongue

but thy counsellors one of a thousand. If thou wouldest get thee a
friend, get him by proving, and be not in haste to trust him. For there
is a friend that is so for his own occasion, and he will not continue in
the day of thy affliction. And there is a friend that turneth to enmity;
and he will discover strife to thy reproach. And there is a friend that
is a companion at the table, and he will not continue in the day of thy
affliction; and in thy prosperity he will be as thyself, and will be
bold over thy servants; if thou shalt be brought low, he will be against
thee, and he will hide himself from thy face.

Such a friendship, that through it we love places and seasons; for as
bright bodies emit rays at a distance, and flowers drop their sweet
leaves on the ground around them, so friends impart favor even to the

cannot express the joy which a friend imparts; they only can know who
have experienced.  A friend is dearer than the light of heaven, for it

should be without friends.

Strange as it may sound, we are sometimes rather disposed to choose our

Truthfulness, frankness, disinterestedness, and faithfulness are the
qualities absolutely essential to friendship, and these must be crowned

Those who want friends to open themselves unto, are cannibals of their

communicating of a man's self to his friend works two contrary effects;
for it redoubleth joys, and cutteth grief in halfs. For there is no man
that imparteth his joys to his friends, but he joyeth the more; and no

dead, they are alive; so entirely does the honor, the memory, the regret

  When to the sessions of sweet silent thought
    I summon up remembrance of things past,
  I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,
    And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:
  Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow,
    For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,
  And weep afresh love's long since canceled woe,
    And moan the expense of many a vanished sight:
  Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,
    And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
  The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,
    Which I new pay as if not paid before.
  But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,
    All losses are restored and sorrows end.

  'Tis mine their inmost souls to see,

What room can there be for friendship, or who can be a friend to any one
whom he does not love for his own sake?  And what is loving, from which

even if none of it accrues to one's self?

A crowd is not company, and faces are but a gallery of pictures; and
talk but a tinkling cymbal, where there is no love.  In a great town
friends are scattered, so that there is not that fellowship, for the

affirm most truly, that it is a mere and miserable solitude, to want
true friends, without which the world is but a wilderness. Whosoever in
the frame of his nature and affections is unfit for friendship, he
taketh it of the beast, and not from humanity.

It is one of the severest tests of friendship to tell your friend of his
faults. If you are angry with a man, or hate him, it is not hard to go
to him and stab him with words; but so to love a man that you cannot

matter.... If our friends are badly chosen they will inevitably drag us
down; if well they will raise us up.

Not only does friendship introduce daylight in the understanding out of
darkness and confusion of thoughts; it maketh a fair day in the
affections from storm and tempests; in consultation with a friend a man

Ancient Menander accounted him happy that had but met the shadow of a

of any; for truly, if I compare all the rest of my forepassed life,
which, although I have, by the mere mercy of God, passed at rest and
ease, and except the loss of so dear a friend, free from all grievous
affliction, with an ever quietness of mind, as one that have taken my
natural and original commodities in good payment, without searching any
others; if, as I say, I compare it all unto the four years I so happily
enjoyed the sweet company and most dear society of that worthy man, it
is nought but a vapor, nought but a dark and irksome light.

I do but languish, I do but sorrow; and even those pleasures all things
present me with, instead of yielding me comfort, do but redouble the
grief of his loss. We were co-partners in all things. All things were
with us at half; methinks I have stolen his part from him. I was so
accustomed to be ever two, and so inured to be never single, that
methinks I am but half myself.

A man can scarce allege his own merits with modesty, much less extol
them; a man cannot sometimes brook to supplicate or beg; and a number of
the like; but all these things are graceful in a friend's mouth which
are blushing in a man's own.

--_Bacon_.

  Come, friend, my fire is burning bright,
    A fire's no longer out of place,
  How clear it glows (there's frost tonight)
    It looks white winter in the face.

  Be mine the tree that feeds the fire,
    Be mine, the sun knows when to set,
  Be mine, the months when friends desire
    To turn in here from cold and wet,

  Eternal blessings crown my earliest friend,
  And round his dwelling guardian saints attend;
  Blest be that spot where cheerful guests retire
  To pause from toil, and trim their evening fire;
  Blest that abode where want and pain repair,
  And every stranger finds a ready chair:
  Blest be those feasts with simple plenty crowned,
  With all the ruddy family around.

  But let us drink a merry toast,
    Let's drink to now and here,
  Good fellowship shall be our boast,
    In either woe or cheer!
  O'er joys we've had, why sorrow brew?
    Why live in days gone past?
  We'll drink to friends both old and new,
    Just so our friends are fast.

  We just shake hands at meeting
    With many that come nigh;
  We nod the head in greeting
    To many that go by.
  But welcome through the gateway
    Our few old friends and true;
  The hearts leap up and straightway
    There's open house for you,
     Old friends,
  There's open house for you.

Beyond all wealth, honor, or even health, is the attachment we form to
noble souls; because to become one with the good, generous, and true, is
to become in a measure good, generous, and true ourselves.

  Ah, friend, let us be true
  To one another! For the world which seems
  To lie before us like a land of dreams,
  So various, so beautiful, so new,
  Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light,
  Nor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain;
  And we are here as on a darkling plain
  Swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight,
  Where ignorant armies clash by night.

  Friendship is power and riches a11 to me;
  Friendship's another element of life;
  Water and fire are not of more general use

  I would do everything to serve a friend.

  Friendship! mysterious cement of the soul!
  Sweet'ner of life, the solder of society!
  I owe thee much. Thou hast deserved of me
  Far, far beyond whatever I can pay.
  Oft have I proved the labors of thy love,
  And the warm efforts of the gentle heart
  Anxious to please. O! when my friend and I
  In some thick wood have wander'd heedless on,
  Hid from the vulgar eye, and sat us down
  Upon the sloping cowslip-covered bank,
  Where the pure limpid stream has slid along,
  In grateful errors through the under-wood,
  Sweet murmurings, methought the shrill-tongued thrush
  Mended his song of love; the sooty blackbird
  Mellow'd his pipe, and soften'd every note;
  The eglantine smell'd sweeter, and the rose
  Assumed a dye more deep.
  O! then the longest summer's day
  Seem'd too, too much in haste: still the full heart
  Had not imparted half: 'tis happiness
  Too exquisite to last!

--_Blair_.

Friendship was given us by nature as the handmaid of virtues, and not as

Friendships, like trees, bring forth fruit after their kind. Corrupt

Friendship is usually treated by the majority of mankind as a tough and
everlasting thing which will survive all manner of bad treatment. But
this is an exceedingly great and foolish error; it may die in an hour of
a single unwise word.

Friendship is a vase, which when it is flawed by heat, or violence, or
accident, may as well be broken at once; it can never be trusted after.
The more graceful and ornamental it was, the more clearly do we discern
the hopelessness of restoring it to its former state. Coarse stones, if
they are fractured, may be cemented again; precious ones never.

  God never loved me in so sweet a way before;
  'Tis he alone who can such blessings send;
  And when His love would new expression find

  I thank Thee, Lord, for every moment dropped
  Into my life that had some sweetness in it,
  For all the golden hours when friendship met
  And gave up heart for heart and thought for thought,
  For all the love that faithful hearts let fall,
  To drop into mine own; for every look
  From loving eyes; for every smile or word
  That gladdened me; for subtle influence
  That made me strong, dear Lord, I thank Thee.

    Through the wide door that never could remain
  Quite closed between us for a little day.

Tell me, gentle traveler, who hast wandered through the world, and seen
the sweetest roses blow, and brightest gliding rivers, of all thine eyes
have seen, which is the fairest land? "Child, shall I tell thee where

My coat and I live comfortably together.  It has assumed all my

  O sweeter than the honey well,
    Deep in the sweetest rose of June,
  And all sweet things the tongue can tell
    On clover-scented afternoon,
  Is friendship that has lived for years
  Through fortune, failure, and through tears.

  Though he who wears it sacredly
    Be swarted like the rafters are
  That shelter him, eternity
    May hold few jewels half so rare!
  And God will find for such a friend
  Some sweeter slumber in the end.

  Still, Love a summer sunrise shines,
    So rich its clouds are hung,
    So sweet its songs are sung.
  And Friendship's but broad, common day,
    With light enough to show
    Where fruit with brambles grow;
    With warmth enough to feed
    The grain of daily need.

  Only--but this is rare--
    When a beloved hand is laid in ours,
  When jaded with the rush and glare
    Of the interminable hours,
  Our eyes can in another's eyes read clear,
  When our world-deafened ear
  Is by the tones of a loved voice caressed--
  A bolt is shot back somewhere in our breast,
  And a lost impulse of feeling stirs again.
  The eye sinks inward, and the heart lies plain,
  And what we mean, we say, and what we would, we know.

  Of all the heavenly gifts that mortal men commend,
  What trusty treasure in the world can countervail a friend?
  Our health is soon decayed; goods, casual, light and vain;
  Broke have we seen the force of power, and honor suffer stain.
  In body's lust man doth resemble but base brute;
  True virtue gets and keeps a friend, good guide of our pursuit.
  Whose hearty zeal with ours accords in every case;
  No term of time, no space of place, no storm can it deface.

--_Nicholas Grimoald_.

       *       *       *       *       *

When we have fallen through story after story of our vanity and
aspiration, and sit rueful among the ruins, then it is that we begin to
measure the stature of our friends; how they stand between us and our
own contempt, believing in our best.

  Some I remember and will ne'er forget
  My early friends, friends of my evil day;
  Friends in my mirth, friends in my misery too,
  Friends given by God in mercy and in love;
  My counsellors, my comforters, and guides;
  My joy in grief, my second bliss in joy;
  Companions of my young desires; in doubt
  My oracles; my wings in high pursuit.
  Oh, I remember, and will ne'er forget
  Our meeting spots, our chosen sacred hours;
  Our burning words that utter'd all the soul;
  Our faces beaming with unearthly love;
  Sorrow with sorrow sighing, hope with hope
  Exulting, heart embracing heart entire.

  Some love the glow of outward show,
    Some love mere wealth, and try to win it;
  The house to me may lowly be,
    If I but like the people in it!

  What's all the gold that glitters cold,
    When link'd to hard or haughty feeling?
  Whate'er we're told, the nobler gold
    Is truth of heart and manly dealing!

  Then let them seek, whose minds are weak,
    Mere fashion's smile, and try to win it;
  The house to me may lowly be,
    If I but like the people in it!

--_Swain_.

       *       *       *       *       *
  Talk not of wasted affection,
  Affection never was wasted;
  If it enrich not the heart of another,
  Its waters returning
  Back to their springs like the rain,
  Shall fill them full of refreshment;
  That which the fountain sends forth
  Returns again to the fountain.

There is no greater bane to friendship than adulation, fawning, and
flattery.  For this vice should be branded under as many names as
possible, being that of worthless and designing men, who say everything
with a view of pleasing, and nothing with regard to truth. Now while
hypocrisy in all things is blamable (for it does away with all judgment
of truth, and adulterates truth itself), so especially is it repugnant
to friendship, for it destroys all truth, without which the name of
friendship can avail nothing.

--_Cicero_.

       *       *       *       *       *

These things do not require to be spoken; there is something in the hand
grip and the look in the eye that makes you know your man.

There is nothing like putting the shine on another's face to put the
shine on our own. Nine-tenths of all loneliness, sensitiveness,
despondency, moroseness, are connected with personal interests.  Turn
more of those selfish interests into unselfish ones, and by so much we
change opportunities for disheartenment into their opposite. By a law of
Nature part of her beautiful economy, he who lives most for others is
really living most for himself.

The foundation of that steadfastness and constancy which we seek in

The wise man seeks a friend in whom are those qualities which he himself

  The Swallow is a summer bird;
    He in our chimneys, when the weather
  Is fine and warm, may then be heard
    Chirping his notes for weeks together.

  Come there but one cold wintry day,
    Away will fly our guest the Swallow:
  And much like him we find the way
    Which many a gay young friend will follow.

  In dreary days of snow and frost,
    Closer to Man will cling the Sparrow:
  Old friends, although in life we're crost,
    Their hearts to us will never narrow.

  Give me the bird--give me the friend--
    Will sing in frost--will love in sorrow--
  Whate'er mischance to-day may send,
    Will greet me with his sight to-morrow.

  The earth-born clod who hugs his idol pelf,
  His only friends are Mammon and himself;
  The drunken sots, who want the art to think,
  Still cease from friendship when they cease from drink.
  The empty fop who scarce for man will pass,
  Ne'er sees a friend but when he views his glass.
  Friendship first springs from sympathy of mind,
  Which to complete the virtues all combine,
  And only found 'mongst men who can espy
  The merits of his friend without envy.
  Thus all pretending friendship's but a dream,
  Whose base is not reciprocal esteem.

There are few subjects which have been more written upon, and less
understood, than that of friendship. To follow the dictates of some,
this virtue instead of being the messenger of pain becomes the source of
every inconvenience. Such specialists, by expecting too much from
friendship, dissolve the connection, and by drawing the bands too
loosely at length break them. It is certain that the best method to
cultivate this virtue, is by letting it, in some measure, make itself; a
similitude of minds and of studies, and even sometimes a diversity of
pursuits, will produce all the pleasures that arise from it. The current
of tenderness widens as it proceeds; and two men imperceptibly find
their hearts filled with good nature for each other, when they were at
first only in pursuit of mirth or relaxation.

midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this eBook on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
