FOREWORD


The Community Cook Book is a collection of recipes chosen from many
hundreds that may well be considered representative of the best to be
found in any of the more intelligent and progressive of American
Communities in which a part of the population make occasional visits to
all parts of the country from which they bring back choice recipes to
contribute to the neighborhood fund. Added to this, that constant change
and interchange of a part of the population, and if the best recipes of
such a section be carefully selected and classified, then in a real
American Community's Cook Book, such as this, we have one of the most
valuable practical cook books in the world.

In presenting this cook book, the compilers were guided by the fact that
what each housekeeper needs, is not so much a great variety of ways, but
a few successful ways of preparing each article of food.




BREAD, BISCUITS, ROLLS AND PASTRY

  "'Bread,' says he, 'dear brothers, is the staff of life.'"


BAKING POWDER BISCUITS.

Two cups flour, two teaspoonfuls baking powder, one-half teaspoonful
salt, two tablespoonfuls lard, a little sugar if desired, one-half cup
milk or water, milk preferred. Mix flour, salt, sugar and baking powder
well with fork; add milk. When well mixed, drop in small quantities onto
buttered pans. Bake eight minutes in moderate oven.


BAKING POWDER BISCUITS.

Two cups flour, two teaspoonfuls baking powder, one-half teaspoonful
salt, two tablespoonfuls butter, milk enough to make soft dough. Mix dry
ingredients, chop in butter, add milk, mixing all the while with a
wooden paddle or knife. Toss on a small floured board, roll lightly to
one-half inch in thickness. Shape with cutter. Place on a buttered pan
and bake in a hot oven.


BOSTON BROWN BREAD.

One level pint cornmeal scalded, one level tablespoonful salt, one cup
New Orleans molasses, two teaspoonfuls soda over which pour a little
boiling water, one pint sour milk; put half the soda in the molasses and
the remainder in the milk. Stiffen with Graham flour. Steam four hours,
and brown in oven for about fifteen minutes.


BUCKWHEAT CAKES.

One cake yeast, one coffee-cup cornmeal, two coffee-cups buckwheat, one
teaspoonful salt, one quart tepid water. Before cooking, add four
tablespoonfuls milk and two of molasses in which you have stirred a
teaspoonful of soda.


CORNBREAD.

Sift three-fourths cup cornmeal, three-fourths cup flour, two and
one-half teaspoonfuls baking powder, three-fourths teaspoonful salt, one
tablespoonful sugar. Work in tablespoonful butter, then add
three-fourths cup sweet milk, into which one or two eggs have been
beaten. Pour into greased pans and bake in a moderate oven. If sour milk
is used, take one and one-half teaspoonful baking powder and one-fourth
teaspoonful soda.


CORN GEMS.

Two eggs, one-half cup white flour, one cup milk, one cup corn flour,
one tablespoonful butter, one teaspoonful salt, one heaping teaspoonful
baking powder. Pour enough boiling water over corn flour to wet it and
burst starch grains. Beat eggs very light. Mix dry ingredients to corn
flour, then eggs, milk and last butter. Bake twenty-five minutes in hot
oven.


CRUMPETS.

One pint of milk, four ounces butter, one teaspoonful salt, one cake
compressed yeast, three cups flour. Scald milk and let stand until
lukewarm, then add salt and flour, beat vigorously, then add butter
melted and the yeast, beat again, cover and stand in a warm place until
very light. Grease muffin rings and place them on a hot griddle. Fill
each ring half full of batter. Bake until brown on one side, then turn
and brown the other side. Take from the fire and stand aside until
wanted. When ready to use, steam and serve with butter, marmalade,
syrup, jam, or anything else desired.


DUMPLINGS.

One pint flour, one level teaspoonful salt, one heaping teaspoonful
baking powder, one heaping teaspoonful lard, enough milk and water to
make a soft dough. Roll one-half inch thick, cut in squares, or with
biscuit cutter, and lay in on top of stew. Cook ten minutes.


FRENCH BREAD.

After softening one cake of compressed yeast in one-half cup lukewarm
water, stir in enough flour to make a very stiff dough. Knead well,
shaping into a ball. Make two cuts on top about one-quarter inch deep.
Place in a pan of tepid water until it swells and floats. When very
light put into a bowl containing one-half cup salted water, stir in
enough flour to make a stiff dough. Let stand in a temperature of 68 or
70 degrees F. until light. Shape into loaf, let lighten again and bake.


GRAHAM BREAD.

Two cups sour milk, two teaspoonfuls soda dissolved in little warm
water, one-fourth cup sugar, one-half cup molasses, one egg, salt, three
and one-half cups Graham flour. Bake one hour.


GRAHAM BREAD.

With one pint warm milk, one cake of yeast and white flour, make a
sponge. One teaspoonful salt not heaped, one-half cup molasses. Let
rise, then stir in sifted brown flour till partly stiff, put in baking
pan, let rise, then bake.


GRIDDLE CAKES.

One-half pint milk, one-half pint warm water, one-half cake yeast, one
teaspoonful salt, one egg, one tablespoonful melted lard, flour enough
to make a batter like ordinary batter-cakes. Let rise over night and fry
for breakfast.


KENTUCKY CORN BREAD.

One pint thick, sour milk, two teaspoonfuls salt, one egg. Mix with this
enough cornmeal to make a batter not stiff. Use meal of medium
fineness--not the very fine sold in most groceries. Beat well; add last
one level teaspoonful soda dissolved in a little water. Allow a
tablespoonful of lard to become very hot in baking pan; pour into the
batter, stir, and turn into pan. Bake until cooked through.


MILK BREAD.

Scald one pint of milk, pour while hot over a tablespoonful of butter,
one tablespoonful sugar, one teaspoonful salt. When nearly cold, add
one-fourth cake of yeast, dissolved in one-half a cup of lukewarm water,
add flour stiff enough to knead. Knead until smooth and elastic, cover,
and let rise until morning, then shape into loaves, let rise again, bake
from forty to fifty minutes; rolls from fifteen to twenty minutes.


MUFFINS.

One egg, one-half cup sugar, two cups flour, two heaping teaspoonfuls
baking powder, three-fourths cup milk, salt. Mix egg with sugar. Sift
flour, baking powder and salt, add to egg and sugar alternately with the
milk and beat well. In season add blueberries. If short of milk, use
part water.


NUT BREAD.

Four and one-half cups wheat flour, eight teaspoonfuls baking powder,
one teaspoonful salt, one cup sugar, two cups sweet milk, one large cup
chopped walnuts, two eggs well beaten. Stir all dry ingredients together
thoroughly, add eggs and milk. Stand twenty minutes before baking. Bake
in two tins about forty-five minutes in a moderate oven.


PARKER HOUSE ROLLS.

Two cups scalded milk, two tablespoonfuls sugar, one teaspoonful salt,
two tablespoonfuls butter, one egg, one yeast cake dissolved in
one-fourth cup lukewarm water. Mix dry ingredients and butter in the hot
milk; when slightly cool, add flour enough to make a drop batter, beat
well, add the yolk of egg, then the white beaten until stiff, and lastly
the dissolved yeast cake, beat hard. Then add flour enough for a soft
dough that you can handle. Turn on a well-floured board and knead until
covered with blisters, turn into a well-buttered bowl. Cover and place
in a temperature of 75 degrees until it doubles its bulk. Shape into
rolls, butter and cover until they are very light. Bake in a quick oven
until a delicate brown.


PARKER HOUSE CORN ROLLS.

One and one-fourth cup white flour (measurements level), three-fourths
cup cornmeal, four teaspoonfuls baking powder, one-half teaspoonful
salt, one tablespoonful sugar, two tablespoonfuls butter, one egg,
one-half cup milk. Method: Mix and sift dry ingredients in a bowl; chop
butter in with a knife; beat egg, to which add one-half cup milk; add
all slowly to dry ingredients to make a soft dough that can be handled;
add more milk, if necessary; toss lightly on floured board and pat to
one-half inch thickness; cut with round cutter, patting piece of butter
in center; fold in center, so that opposite edges meet; put in buttered
baking sheet; wet top with milk and bake in quick oven ten to fifteen
minutes.


POP-OVERS.

Two cups milk, one cup flour, two eggs, one-half teaspoonful salt. Beat
eggs very light with Dover egg beater, add flour, milk and salt. Warm
muffin pans slightly, butter them, and fill half full. Bake in hot oven
until brown. This will make twelve pop-overs.


POTATO ROLLS.

Two cups hot mashed potatoes (four cups of sliced potatoes make about
two cups of mashed potatoes), one scant cup lard, two tablespoonfuls of
sugar, two teaspoonfuls salt, three well-beaten eggs. Mix all well
together and have it lukewarm, then add one-half cake of yeast, which
has been soaked in a cup of lukewarm water for twenty minutes. Let rise
two hours in a warm place; work up (not too stiff) with flour; rise
again. When very light, roll thin on a biscuit-board, cut with a cutter,
put in pan, rise again, and bake in a very hot oven. This will make
about sixty rolls.

CEREALS, BREAKFAST FOODS

  "Look up! the wide extended plain
  Is billowy with its ripened grain,
  And on the summer winds are rolled
  Its waves of emerald and gold."


CORN MEAL MUSH.

Allow one pint of meal and one teaspoonful of salt to a quart of water.
Sprinkle meal gradually into boiling salted water, stirring all the
time. Boil rapidly for a few minutes, then let simmer for a long time.
Very palatable served with milk; some people like it with butter and
pepper. For fried mush let it get cold, then cut in slices, dip in flour
and fry in suet until brown.


HOMINY.

This is very good when well cooked, and may be simply boiled until done
in salted water, and served with pepper and butter. It is good fried
like mush.


MACARONI WITH CHEESE.

After boiling macaroni in salted water until soft, sprinkle with grated
cheese; repeat, pour over a sauce made of butter, flour, salt and
scalded milk; cover with bread crumbs and bake until brown.


RICE.

Rice has been cultivated from time immemorial. While not so valuable a
food as some of the other cereals, it forms the larger part of the diet
of people in the tropics and in semi-tropical countries, and is used
extensively in other places. It is eaten by more human beings than any
other cereal; is not equal to wheat as a brain food, but worthy of the
high place it holds in the estimation of mankind.

It may be simply boiled and served as a vegetable, with pepper and
butter, or served with sugar and cream. It is good cooked in milk. Is
baked like macaroni with cheese, and cooked in various ways in
combination with meat or vegetables.


BOILED RICE.

One of the quickest ways of preparing rice is to fill a large kettle
with water, allow it to come to a boil; when bubbling vigorously throw
in two cups of rice and boil hard twenty-five minutes. Empty into a
colander and dash under cold water, which will separate the grains.
Season with pepper and salt, heap lightly on a dish and put a lump of
butter on top.


ROLLED OATS.

None of the breakfast foods which are so much used are so wholesome as a
simple dish of rolled oats or the old-fashioned oatmeal. Served with or
without cream and sugar, these are to be highly recommended to persons
who are compelled to live indoors a great deal, and are generally
relished by those who lead an outdoor life. Although rolled oats is
supposed to be a dish quickly prepared, it is better, like oatmeal, for
being cooked a long time, and baked for two hours, after being boiled a
few minutes, it is very palatable and nutritious.




SOUPS

  "La soupe fait le soldat." ("The soup makes the soldier.")


BEAN SOUP.

One pint navy beans, soak over night, cook till they are very tender,

with a cup of the soup and a little butter, cook a moment or two, add to

carrot, one onion, one celery root, one turnip, one parsley root, one
bay leaf, two or three whole allspice, one-half can tomatoes. Let boil
slowly one day. Strain and skim.

one onion, one carrot, two pounds marrow bones, four peppercorns, a
bouquet of herbs and one bay leaf, three stalks of celery, juice of a
lemon, two tablespoonfuls butter or marrow, one-half cup of sherry, one
turnip. Put vegetables in last, spices about one-half hour; brown
vegetables in butter or suet; brown a few pieces of meat, to give a good
color to the soup, turn into soup digester and cover with cold water.

hours. Strain in an earthen vessel, cool, remove fat, clear and serve
hot in cups.


CORN SOUP.

One can cornlet or corn, one pint cold water, one quart heated milk, two
tablespoonfuls butter, one tablespoonful chopped onion, two
tablespoonfuls flour, two teaspoonfuls salt, one-fourth teaspoonful

twenty minutes; melt butter, add chopped onions and cook until light
brown; add flour, and when thoroughly mixed add milk gradually. Add this

milk. Cook ten minutes. Mash celery in water it has been cooked in and
stir in boiling milk. Strain and serve.


CREAM OF CORN SOUP.

Put one pint of milk in a double boiler, add one pint of grated corn,
two teaspoonfuls of salt; rub together one tablespoonful of flour and
one of butter. Add them to the soup when boiling. Just before serving
add one-half pint of whipped cream.


FRENCH PEA SOUP.

Cover a quart of peas with water and boil with an onion till they mash
easily. Mash and add a pint of water. Cook together two tablespoonfuls
each of flour and butter until smooth but not brown. Add to the peas

SALADS

  "Salads and eggs and lighter fare."


More progressive Americans now understand the value of the salad, and in
this way use many vegetables, fish and meats that heretofore have not
been extensively used for that purpose. There is room for much
interesting experimenting in the making of salads. Almost endless
variety may be had by ingenious mixing and combining of suitable
ingredients. Used sparingly, they give a zest to the plainest meal, and
the olive oil which is used so frequently in the preparation of salads
is of immense value in promoting health.

The greens used in making salad, lettuce, dandelion and water cress
should always be most carefully washed, and served only when fresh,
crisp and cold. Many canned vegetables and left-overs may be used in
salad, which would not be nearly so appetizing prepared in any other
way.


ASPARAGUS SALAD.

Use either fresh or canned asparagus. If fresh, of course it should be
cooked in the usual way and allowed to cool. Only very tender asparagus
is suitable for salad. Cut green or red peppers into rings, put four
stalks in each ring. Place these bundles on lettuce leaves and serve
with usual French dressing. A little pat of Philadelphia cream cheese
may be put on edge of each plate.

covered; boil fifteen minutes, drain off all water and add a dressing
made as follows: Half teacup vinegar, two-thirds as much sugar, salt,
pepper, one-half teaspoonful mustard, one tablespoonful butter or olive
oil. When this is boiling hot add one teacup cream and one egg, stirred
together; mix thoroughly and immediately with the cabbage. Cook a
moment. Serve hot.


LETTUCE SALAD.

Remove the outer leaves from a large, solid head of lettuce. Tear each
leaf into three or four pieces; put them into a towel and on ice or in a
cold place. When wishing to serve, put into a bowl, mix one
tablespoonful vinegar, one-half teaspoonful salt and one-quarter
teaspoonful pepper and sprinkle over the lettuce; stir well, add four
tablespoonfuls thick, sweet cream and mix quickly. Serve at once.

MEAT

  "Meat was made for mouths."


While it is undoubtedly true that raw meat is, as a rule, more easily
digested than cooked, our present state of civilization demands that it
be cooked, and we can only comply with the demand, preparing the food in
question so that it may be not only attractive to the eye, but in a
manner that will render it pleasing to the taste and readily
assimilated. Cooking softens the tissues, making the act of eating more
enjoyable, and also destroys parasitic growths.

To boil meat when broth is not desired, plunge into boiling water. The
water should be allowed to boil for about ten minutes and then be
permitted to fall somewhat below boiling point and kept at even heat for
a long time. The juices and flavors are thus retained.

It is not desirable that fish should be treated in this manner, as the
boiling water would break it into little pieces.

To stew meat, put small portions into cold water and raise temperature
slowly, until very hot, but not quite boiling. Let it remain thus for
some hours, and a rich broth, as well as juicy and tender meat, will
result.

In roasting meat it is well to remember that the smaller roast requires
the hotter fire. Intense heat produces a semi-solid condition of the
exterior, and prevents the drying up of the meat juices. Great heat
would be inapplicable to large cuts, the exterior of which would be
burned to a coal under such treatment before the heat could reach the
interior.

Young housekeepers and others who are not familiar with the various cuts
of meat obtainable in most of our markets will do well to consider
thoughtfully the accompanying illustrations.

FIG. 1.--Diagrams of cuts of beef.]

In selecting beef we must remember that color is of great importance.
The surface of a fresh lean cut should be a bright red, while the fat
should be clear white. After being exposed to a warm atmosphere the
surface will of course become darker in color.

The loin commands a higher market price than any other cut, on account
of its tenderness and quality. The names applied to different parts of
the loin vary in different localities. The part nearest the ribs is
often called the "short steak," the other end the "sirloin."

It is interesting in this connection to recall the story which has been
told regarding the origin of the word "sirloin." It is said that this
steak found such favor with some epicurean king of olden times that he,
in a spirit of jocularity and good humor, bestowed upon it the honor of
knighthood, to the great delight of his assembled court, and as "Sir
Loin" it was thereafter known. It is a pity to spoil so good a story,
but the fact is that the word is derived from the French "sur" (upon)
and "longe" (loin), and the preferable orthography would therefore be
"surloin." However spelled, and whatever its history, the sirloin is
deservedly popular.

Between the short and sirloin is the portion usually called the
tenderloin, the name of which indicates its prevailing characteristic,
the tenderness which makes it a much-to-be-desired cut in spite of its
lack of juiciness and flavor as compared with other cuts.

The rib is the cut between the loin and chuck, and contains the best
roasts. The fat on the best grade of ribs should be about one-half inch
deep.

Round steaks are rather popular, but as Americans have a preference for
loin and rib cuts, a large share of the lower grades of "rounds" are
used otherwise, being converted into Hamburger, used as sausage
trimmings and disposed of in many other ways.

Chucks are used extensively as shoulder steak, boiling pieces, and make
very good roasts. Pot roasts are cut from the lower side, and stews or
soup meat from the neck. The better grade of chucks should have a
complete covering of fat, thickest at the rib end of the cut.

FIG. 2.--Diagrams of cuts of veal.]

Quality in veal is determined by color and grain of flesh. It should be
light pink, nearly white, and should contain a quantity of fat. The many
ways of cooking and serving veal are so well known as to need but
passing mention; veal loaf, veal cutlets, chops, pie, stew, curry of
veal and many others are all favorite dishes in many homes.

FIG. 3.--Diagrams of cuts of lamb and mutton.]

In selecting mutton or lamb we should be guided by color, fineness of
grain, thickness of flesh and amount of fat. Mutton of a dull brick red
is preferable, though the color varies from that to dark red. Lamb on
account of its superior flavor is more popular than mutton. The flesh of
lamb should be light in color, of fine grain and the fat evenly
distributed. The nutritive value of mutton and lamb is practically the
same as beef.

FIG. 4.--Diagrams of cuts of pork.]

The larger share of dressed pork is almost entirely clear fat, which
should be white, firm and evenly distributed. Skin should be thin and
smooth. Any detailed description of the various cuts of pork would be
superfluous here. Not all our eloquence could adequately picture the
delight with which an epicure gazes upon a ham boiled or baked by an
experienced Kentucky or Virginia cook. The "roasting pig" is also a
favorite in many places, and long has been, for, according to Irving, it
was much prized by Ichabod Crane of Sleepy Hollow, and it has been
mentioned by so great and learned a poet as Shakespeare.

Regarding all meats, we wish to say that as a rule the cheaper cuts have
as much food value as the more expensive ones. Careful cooking will
render the less expensive cuts delightfully appetizing. It is an
advantage to housekeepers to know that meat need not be the highest in
price to be nutritious and palatable.


BAKED BREAST OF MUTTON.

Sew up breast of mutton in a thin cloth, put into a stewpan, nearly
cover with cold salt water, and let simmer, allowing ten minutes to each
pound. Take out of pan and cloth, put into baking dish, rub over with
mutton drippings, butter or fat, sprinkle with flour and bake one-half
hour in hot oven, basting frequently with its own broth. Just before
removing from oven, strew with bread crumbs and butter and let brown.
Serve with brown sauce made from broth in which meat was cooked.


BEEF OMELET.

Three pounds chopped steak, three eggs, one and one-half cup rolled
crackers, lump of butter size of a walnut, salt and pepper to taste,
one-half cup milk. Mix thoroughly, make out in rolls, wrap in cloth, and
bake two hours.


BEEFSTEAK WITH OYSTER BLANKET.

Broil an inch-thick sirloin steak, remove to platter, spread with
butter, sprinkle with salt and pepper; cover steak with one pint of
oysters, sprinkle with salt and pepper, dot with butter, place on grate
in hot oven until the oysters are plump.


BEEF TENDERLOIN.

Take tenderloin of beef and lard it with pork. Put one can of mushrooms
with the beef and cook in oven twenty minutes. Then cut the meat in
slices one and one-half inch thick. On top of each slice place a few of
the mushrooms and a little of the gravy, and set back in the oven five
minutes to keep hot. Serve the slices on a chop plate, forming a circle,
and filling in the center with peas.


BLANKETED HAM WITH SWEET POTATOES AND APPLES.

Cut off the fat close to the edge of a slice of ham one-half inch thick.
Put fat through meat chopper, spread on top of ham, then sprinkle
one-half cup of brown sugar and wine-glass of sherry over it. Peel and
quarter four large sweet potatoes and four large apples. Put ham in oven
in covered roasting pan. After it has cooked a quarter of an hour add
apples and sweet potatoes. Now cook all of it three-quarters of an hour.
This makes a delicious and savory dish, and is so substantial that
little else is required for a meal.


BROWN STEW.

Thirty-five-cent beef off the shoulder; cut in pieces, cover with water
and stew two hours until tender. Add one tablespoonful butter, and
thicken with flour. Cook until brown.


CHICKEN CROQUETTE.

One-half pound chicken or veal, chopped very fine; season with one-half
teaspoonful salt, one-half teaspoonful celery salt, one-fourth
teaspoonful onion juice, one teaspoonful chopped parsley, one
teaspoonful lemon juice, one saltspoonful white pepper, one-fourth
saltspoonful cayenne. Mix with enough cream sauce to be easily handled;
let cool, then shape into rolls. Roll on fine bread crumbs, dip in
beaten egg, then roll in bread crumbs and fry in smoking-hot fat, drain
on tissue paper. Boil meat in three quarts hot water, cold for soup,
season with one teaspoonful salt, four grains pepper.


CHICKEN CROQUETTES.

Two pair sweetbreads, boiled and chopped fine, one teacupful boiled
chicken chopped (use nothing but the white meat), one teacupful boiled
bread and milk, pretty stiff; one-half pound butter, salt and pepper to
taste, mold in shape, roll in cracker crumbs, beaten egg, and again in
cracker crumbs, and fry in boiling lard.

Chicken Croquette Remarks.

Prepare meat and seasoning first. Put flour in hot butter dry, two
tablespoonfuls cold water in the egg. Boil meat very slowly, until very
tender. Make a hole in the flour when pouring in any liquid. Drop bread
into hot fat, count forty slowly, until brown, fat then at proper heat.
Cut a large potato in the hot grease; it takes out impurities.


CROQUETTES.

Cold turkey, chicken, veal or lamb, chopped fine; add one-fourth as much
bread crumbs as meat; salt, pepper and herbs to taste; then to one cup
of the mixture one well-beaten egg. Make in small balls egg-shaped, and
fry in boiling lard.


FRICATELLI.

Chop raw fresh pork very fine, add salt and pepper and two small onions
chopped fine, half as much stale bread as there is meat, soaked until
soft, two eggs; mix all well together, make into oblong patties, and fry
as you would oysters or other patties. A nice breakfast dish. Serve with
sliced lemon.


HAM TOAST.

One-fourth pound of either boiled or fried ham; chop it fine, mix with
the yolks of two eggs well beaten; one tablespoonful butter, enough

putting in a little onion if liked. Let nearly all the water boil away.
When thoroughly tender take the meat out and pour the gravy in a bowl.
Put a large lump of butter in the pot, dredge the meat with flour and
return it to the pot to brown, turning it often to prevent burning. Skim
fat from gravy poured off of meat; pour gravy in with the meat and stir
in a large spoonful of flour; wet with a little water; let boil ten or
fifteen minutes and pour into gravy dish. Try sometimes cooking in this
way a piece of beef which has been placed in spiced pickle for two or
three days.


RAGOUT OF BEEF.

Cut two pounds of the upper round of beef into inch squares, dredge them
with salt and pepper and roll them in flour. Put into a saucepan some
butter and some drippings, or a little suet, and let it fry out, using

turn in the pieces of meat and let them cook until well browned on all
sides; watch and turn them as soon as browned, then draw the meat to one
side of the pan and add a tablespoonful of flour; let the flour brown,
and add a cupful of stock or water, and stir it until it comes to a

hot frying pan and turning until all the surface is browned. Put it in a
kettle with one-half pint of water, and place it where it will keep just
below boiling point. Add just enough water now and then to keep meat
from burning. Have close-fitting cover to keep in the steam. Cook until
very tender. Serve hot or cold.

bake twenty minutes.




EGGS


Eggs should be kept in cool places. If a recipe calls for just the white
of an egg, the yolk may be kept from hardening by putting in a cup of
cold water. Eggs may be cooked soft in two ways: Pour boiling water over
the egg and cover them from five to ten minutes. Second method: Put eggs
into cold water, and when water bubbles they are cooked.


BAKED EGGS.

Cut circular pieces out from the stem end of round tomato and remove
part of the pulp. Season with salt and pepper; also with onion, juice
and parsley, if liked. Break an egg into each tomato and put in a slow
oven until each egg is set. Serve on hot buttered toast.


POACHED EGGS.

Partly fill a shallow pan with boiling water. Break eggs singly into a
saucer, sliding each as broken into the boiling water. Keep pan where
water will not quite boil. With a spoon baste the water over the yolk
until it is covered thinly with white. Remove each egg with a skimmer,
trim off ragged edges, and serve on buttered toast.


SHIRRED EGGS.

VEGETABLES

     "Perhaps if we could penetrate Nature's secrets we should find that
     what we call weeds are more essential to the well-being of the
     world than the most precious fruit or grain."--Hawthorne.


The simplest methods of cooking and serving vegetables are generally the
best. The most common method of cooking them is in boiling water. All
green vegetables, bulbs and tubers should be crisp and firm when put on
to cook, and should, of course, be thoroughly cleaned before being
cooked.

Almost all vegetables may be served in the form of salad. Our most
common green salad plant is lettuce; celery is next, but endive, chicory
and dandelion, with many others, may be used to advantage in this way,
and furnish pleasing variety to the menu.

Nearly all vegetables are good canned, and if care is taken in preparing
and canning, it is possible to have fresh-tasting fruits and vegetables
through all seasons.

Thorough sterilization is necessary in canning or preserving. In the
first place, use good jars. Glass jars will be found the most
satisfactory. Those with glass top and rubber ring held in place by a
wire spring are the cheapest in the long run, although the initial
expense may be somewhat high. Never use defective rubbers, as vegetables
often spoil after being sterilized, because of bad rubbers.

A clothes boiler makes a good container to use in sterilizing. A false
bottom made of wire netting cut to fit or strips of wood may be used, as
the jars will break if set flat on the bottom of the boiler.

Select vegetables that have not begun to harden or decay. Always can as
soon as possible after gathering. Some vegetables are best cooked
before putting in jars; among these are beets, pumpkins and turnips, but
most of them may be packed while raw in jars and cooked as follows:

Pack jar full, adding salt as desired, fill with cold water to the top
of the jar. Put the rubber on the jar and place the glass top on, but do
not press down the spring at the side of the jar. Put as many jars in
the boiler as it will hold without crowding. Pour into the boiler enough
water (cold) to prevent it from going dry during the boiling. Put the
cover on the boiler and bring the water to a boil and keep it boiling
for an hour. (Hour and a half for half-gallon jars.) At the end of this
time remove the boiler cover, and let the steam escape. Press down the
spring on each jar, which clamps on the top, and no outside air can
enter.

On the next day raise the spring at the side of the jar and boil as on
the first day, clamping on the top as before at the end of operation.
Repeat this on the third day. All meats, fruits and vegetables are
sterilized on this principle.

Never subject jars to a draft of cold air when removing them from the
boiler, as this will be likely to crack them. If, after sterilization
seems complete, any jars spoil, increase the time of boiling.


ASPARAGUS.

Cut the tender part into short pieces. Cover with boiling water, and
boil until done. Season with salt and pepper, and serve with most of
juice; or, if preferred, serve with a cream dressing.


BEETS.

Wash the beets carefully without breaking the skin. Cover with boiling
water and boil until tender. Take from the boiling water and drop into
cold. Rub off the skin, cut in thin slices and serve at once with salt
and butter.


CINCINNATI BAKED BEANS.

tablespoonfuls of C sugar, one tablespoonful standard mustard. Mix the

FRUITS

  Fruit of all kinds
  She gathers, tribute large, and on the board
  Heaps with unsparing hand.--Milton.


APPLES.

While most people prefer apples cooked in some form, they are very good
and wholesome when eaten raw. There are so many varieties of this fruit
that one finds flavors of almost all other fruits if one tastes a number
of different kinds of apples.


BANANAS.

This is a fruit which is delicious eaten in almost any form. It is
especially good frozen.


CANTALOUPES.

Cantaloupes should be kept on ice and served in halves, each half filled
with chopped ice or peaches, as a breakfast dish. To clean cantaloupes,
scrape out seeds and wash out each half under the cold-water faucet. The
half may be filled with ice cream and served as a dessert.


GRAPES.

Put bunches in a colander and pour cold water over them. Drain and
chill, and arrange prettily on dish. Always be sure to remove the
imperfect grapes.


GRAPE FRUIT.

(Shaddock.)

This fruit was named for Captain Shaddock, who first brought it from the
East Indies. It is delicious, and supposed to have medicinal value. It
is refreshing served for breakfast, but may be used as first course for
any meal. It should be prepared several hours before needed. Cut in
half, remove center pulp with scissors or sharp, small knife; cut each
section away from pulp, put two tablespoonfuls powdered sugar and a
Maraschino cherry in center of each half. Place in cool place till ready
to serve.


ORANGES.

Oranges are the most delightful eaten raw, but there are many other ways
of serving them, the Seville orange being the most preferable for
cooking, and is a little bitter. A simple way of preparing them for a
dessert is to peel the oranges so as to remove outer layer of pulp, then
remove each section from pulp. Put alternately into dessert dish a layer
of oranges sprinkled with powdered sugar and a layer of shredded
cocoanut. Place in cool place and serve.


PEACHES AND PEARS.

These fruits have the high esteem of many people in warm and temperate
climates. The peach is called the Persian apple, and is, like the pear,
delicious served either cooked or raw.


STRAWBERRIES.

These are best served raw, and may be hulled, or if cream is not
desired, serve with the hulls left on and put a mound of powdered sugar
in the center of the fruit dishes.

found especially simple and easy to carry out.

One gallon cider vinegar, one cup granulated sugar, one-third cup salt,
one cup freshly grated horseradish (or two five-cent glasses), one-half
cup ground mustard, one-third ounce saccharine, two tablespoonfuls mixed

pint of juice. Let it boil slowly more than half a day.


CHERRY PRESERVES.

amount of sugar as cherries. Let them stand one hour, put on fire and
let them boil through thoroughly. Pour on a flat platter and let them
stand in the sun until they thicken.


CRAB-APPLE JELLY.

Wash apples, remove blossom and stem ends, put them whole into a
porcelain-lined preserving kettle, add cold water to nearly cover
apples, cover and cook slowly until soft. Mash and drain through
cheese-cloth or coarse sieve. It makes the jelly cloudy to squeeze the
apples. Now allow juice to drip through a jelly bag or through two
thicknesses of cheese-cloth, boil twenty minutes and add equal quantity
of sugar, boil five minutes, skim and turn in glasses. Let the glasses
stand in a sunny window twenty-four hours. A sprig of rose geranium
dropped in syrup while it is boiling the last time will give the jelly a
delicious and unusual flavor.

Pick over six pounds of currants, wash and drain, put into a preserving
kettle a few at a time and mash, cook an hour and strain through double

put in jar, and repeat until raspberries are used. Fill jars with syrup,
and screw on tops.

frequently used. Pick them over, wash and remove stems, put into kettle,
heat to boiling point, mash and boil thirty minutes, strain through
coarse strainer, then allow juice to drip through a double thickness of
cheese-cloth. Measure and boil for five minutes, add equal quantity of
heated sugar, boil three minutes, skim and pour into glasses. Stand in
sunny window twenty-four hours, cover and keep in cool, dry place.


MARMALADE.

FONDANT.

Two cups sugar, nine tablespoonfuls water; when it begins to boil, put
in one-fourth teaspoonful cream of tartar; do not stir after it begins
to boil: In four minutes try by dropping in water; if it balls, take off
the stove and let it cool until it wrinkles on top when moved; then stir

minutes. Then stir with that the beaten eggs, butter, etc. Put into a
buttered baking dish and bake about thirty minutes.


BAKING POWDER.

One pound cream of tartar, one-half pound bicarbonate of soda, one-half
pound flour. Sift the soda and flour together several times, then mix in
cream of tartar and sift again. Put in glass jar and keep dry.


BANANA FRITTERS.

Prepare batter as for plain fritters. Into this dip the quartered
bananas and fry as you would doughnuts. Serve warm with the following
sauce: Boil three-fourths pint sweet milk, beat the yolk of one egg and
a level teaspoonful flour with sugar enough to make the sauce very
sweet. When the milk boils, stir this into it and let it cool. Flavor to
taste.


CHEESE STRAWS.

One-half pound of cheese grated, two tablespoonfuls flour and the yolk
of two eggs. Season with salt and pepper. Mix thoroughly and roll in a
thin sheet. Cut into tiny rings and strips. Bake, being careful not to
burn, as they bake quickly. When ready to serve place three sticks in
two rings.


CHESTNUTS.

Cover one quart chestnuts with stock. Add two tablespoonfuls sugar and a
pinch of salt, cook until tender. Don't stir. Chestnuts should be
quartered.


GELATINE.

One-half box of Cox's gelatine, enough cold water to cover it, let stand
a moment, then add a pint or little more of boiling water, two cups
sugar, flavoring to taste, turn in mold. Make custard of a pint of milk,
three yolks, three tablespoonfuls sugar. When cool, add vanilla and stir
in lightly, stiffly beaten whites of eggs.


JELLY.

One package gelatine, one pint cold water, let stand two hours, then
pour over it one quart boiling water, one and one-half pound sugar, one
pint wine, juice of three lemons; strain it twice through a canton
flannel bag. Instead of wine use juice of four lemons, gratings of two.


MINCE MEAT.

Mix together one cup sugar, one cup chopped apple, one-half cup raisins
seeded and chopped, one-half cup currants, one-fourth cup butter, one
tablespoonful molasses, one tablespoonful boiled cider, one teaspoonful
cinnamon, one-half teaspoonful cloves, one-half grated nutmeg, one
saltspoonful mace and one teaspoonful salt. Add enough stock, in which
meat has been cooked, to moisten; heat slowly to boiling point and let
simmer an hour; then add one cup of chopped meat and two tablespoonfuls
Barberry jelly. Cook fifteen minutes. If Barberry jelly is not to be
obtained, use some other kind.


OATMEAL GRUEL FOR BABIES.

Boil for three hours or more two tablespoonfuls of oatmeal in one quart
of water. Reduce liquid to one pint and strain. The long boiling is
necessary to break down the cell walls and to make the gruel easy of
digestion by the delicate stomach.


TOMATO SAUCE.

Put a tablespoonful butter and one of flour in a saucepan; mix until
smooth, add one-half pint strained tomatoes, a bay leaf, one-fourth
teaspoonful celery seed. Stir constantly until boiling; add one-half
teaspoonful salt, one-quarter teaspoonful paprika. Strain and use.

then the butter, and cook until it thickens. Stir constantly. Pour it
over toast. Moderate heat and constant stirring, two important points.


YORKSHIRE PUDDING.

Beat the yolks of three eggs until light colored and thick; add one-half
teaspoonful salt and one pint of milk. Add the mixture slowly to
two-thirds cup flour, stir until smooth, then cut and fold in the white
of eggs which have been beaten until stiff and dry. Bake in hot,
well-greased gem pans forty-five minutes. Baste with drippings.


HELPFUL HINTS

Dredge your cake tins with flour and your cake will not stick to the
pan.

Wooden spoons are the best to use when making cakes.

A little butter added to cake frosting greatly improves it.

Moisten grease spots with cold water and soda before scrubbing, as it
lightens the task.

To polish hardwood floors, use equal parts of vinegar, turpentine and
olive oil, thoroughly mixed: Rub in and polish with soft cloth.

To remove mildew stains, cover spots with lemon juice and salt and let
dry in the sun.

Place a piece of wax paper over a knife when cutting butter.

If raisins and currants are rolled in flour before putting in a cake,
they will not sink to the bottom.

When cutting fresh bread, have the knife very hot.

Put a pinch of salt in the whites of eggs to make them whip better.

Stains on knives, however obstinate, will disappear if rubbed with a
piece of raw potato.

Put a slice of potato in the deep fat when frying doughnuts.

If potatoes are pared and laid in cold water just before boiling, they
will be much whiter.

Rice will absorb three times its measure of water and a large quantity
of milk or stock.

One ounce of butter equals two level tablespoonfuls.

One ounce of flour equals four tablespoonfuls.

Allow two level teaspoonfuls of baking powder to each cup of flour when
no eggs are used.


A USEFUL TABLE.

Three teaspoonfuls equal one tablespoonful.

Four tablespoonfuls equal a quarter cup.

One cup of butter or sugar equals one-half pound.

Two cups of flour equals one-half pound.

One rounded tablespoonful of butter, one ounce.

One quart sifted pastry flour equals one pound.

One pint of granulated sugar equals one pound.

One pint of butter equals one pound.

One pint of ordinary liquid, one pound.


PROPORTIONS.

One teaspoonful baking powder to one cup flour.

One teaspoonful cream of tartar and one-half teaspoonful soda to two
cups flour.

A little over an ounce of gelatine to a quart of liquid.


MILK.

Sour milk is used to raise doughs and batters, by adding to one pint
solidly sour milk one teaspoonful soda. Mixtures which contain molasses
require more soda.




BEVERAGES

     "I drink to the general joy of the whole table."


CHOCOLATE.

Use one and one-half squares of bitter chocolate, one-fourth cup sugar,
three cups milk, one cup boiling water and a few grains of salt. Scald
the milk. Melt the chocolate in small saucepan, place over hot water,
add sugar, salt, and gradually the boiling water. When smooth, place on
the fire and boil for one minute; add to scalded milk, mill, and serve
in chocolate cups with whipped cream. One and one-half ounces of vanilla
chocolate may be substituted for the bitter; as it is sweetened, less
sugar is needed.


CHOCOLATE.

German chocolate, three sticks in a boiler; let melt. Add one pint hot
milk, let boil, then stir it for five minutes. Serve with whipped cream
on top. Melt in double boiler.


COCOA.

One and one-half tablespoonfuls prepared cocoa, two tablespoonfuls
sugar, two cups boiling water, two cups milk, and very little salt.
Scald milk. Mix cocoa, sugar and salt, dilute with one-half cup boiling
water to make smooth paste, add remaining water, and boil one minute;
turn into scalded milk and beat two minutes with Dover egg beater until
frothy.


COFFEE.

Use one tablespoonful of coffee to a cup, and one for the pot. Moisten
with cold water and mix well with the white of egg. Make with boiling
water and boil five minutes. Then let it stand in a hot place ten
minutes. Do not simmer--merely keep hot.


COFFEE.

One cup ground coffee, seven cups cold water, one-fourth an egg. Scald
granite-ware pot, dilute the egg with one-half cup of the cold water,
stir into the coffee and mix thoroughly. Add the rest of the water and
bring to a boil slowly. Remove to back of stove, add one tablespoonful
of cold water, and allow it to stand a few minutes.


COMMITTEE JULEP.

Five lemons, two oranges, two cups water, one bunch fresh mint, three
bottles ginger ale, one and one-half cup sugar; ice. Squeeze the juice
from lemons and oranges, add leaves from mint, sugar and water. Let
stand thirty minutes, add a large piece of ice and ginger ale. Serve in
small glasses.


GRAPE JUICE.

Many people are not aware of the excellent qualities of this delightful
and refreshing beverage. It is soothing to the nerves and aids the
appetite. When prepared according to the recipe given below it makes a
delicious and wholesome drink for persons in robust health, and in
addition to this will prove beneficial to those of frail constitutions.

Stem grapes and put them into a kettle with enough water to show. Heat
slowly, until grapes are soft enough to mash. Put them in a cheese-cloth
bag, and when cool enough, press till every drop of juice is extracted.
To two quarts of juice add one cup of sugar; heat and stir until sugar
is thoroughly dissolved. Bottle, cork and seal. When serving this drink,
dilute with water according to taste.


TEA.

Scald an earthen or china teapot. Use a teaspoonful of tea for each
person and one for the pot. Put into the pot and pour in freshly boiled
water, a cupful to each spoonful of tea. _Never boil tea_, but let it
stand in a warm place a few minutes before serving. Serve with or
without milk and sugar.

Tea and coffee, like all stimulants, should be used only in moderation.
The use of either by children or dyspeptics is not to be recommended.
Pure water is the best drink ordinarily for everybody. Most people
prefer cold water, as it is not so insipid as boiled, but a cup of hot
water taken in the morning on arising and one at night just before
retiring will prove of benefit to sufferers from dyspepsia or
indigestion.


THE FIRELESS COOKER.

The idea of the fireless cooker is an old one, bringing things to a
boil, placing into a box of hay and leaving for a few hours to
cook--that method has been used by housewives in some European nations
for a good many years.

The cooker is, of course, made upon the same principle as that almost
indispensable article, the refrigerator. Instead of retaining the cold
and keeping out the heat, the fireless cooker does the opposite by
keeping food which has been brought to a boiling point at a temperature
high enough to continue the process of cooking for many hours.

Every one has wrapped up ice in a newspaper or carpet to keep it from
melting. In making the fireless cooker the material used for packing
around the boiling food is paper, hay, wool or cork, because any one of
these things is a poor conductor of heat--that is, the heat can not go
through them easily. Though there are many makes of fireless cookers on
the market, a home-made one will serve the purpose just as well, and for
the convenience afforded requires a comparatively small amount of time
and material.


A HOME-MADE FIRELESS COOKER.

Materials required: A box or barrel, one pair of strong hinges, a hasp,
material for stuffing, one or more large pails, one or more small pails
or pans, muslin--1-1/2 yard or more, depending on size of box; a cooking
thermometer, heavy pasteboard, brown paper, tacks and screws.

The box selected may be an unpainted one, to be had from most any store
for a few pennies, but the boards should be heavy enough to put on
hinges and a hasp. It should be four or five inches larger than the
kettle it is to contain. The easiest stuffings to procure are hay,
excelsior, or paper; among others which should be covered to keep them
in place are wool, mineral wool, cork, sawdust and cotton. If hay is
used, it should be soft.

The best shape for the cooking utensil is a pail about the depth of its
own diameter; the sides should be straight and perpendicular to the
bottom, and the cover should fit securely in place. A smaller utensil
may be used inside the larger one; a pudding pan serves the purpose,
resting on the rim of the pail. Care should always be taken to have
covers that fit snugly on any pans that are used in the cooker. Aluminum
ware makes the best utensil, though enameled ware or agate ware may be
used. A six-quart pail with a pan to fit inside of it is a good size for
the ordinary family.

It is best to line the box and cover with a thickness of heavy paper or
several thicknesses of newspaper; asbestos sheeting may be used instead
of paper. Now pack in the box a firm layer of packing material about
four inches deep, not less; this must raise the cooking pail to within
three to five inches of top of box. Place utensil in middle of space on
this layer and pack around it closely until level with top of the
kettle. When it is removed a hole will be left just large enough for it
to slip into again.

A cushion should be made to cover the kettle. If more than one kettle is
used a cushion should be made for each. The cushion must be thick enough
to fill the box when the kettle is in place. Cut two pieces of muslin or
denim the sizes of top of box and join with a strip which is four or
five inches wide; fill with same material used in packing the box. There
should always be a slight pressure when the lid is closed.

The box is now ready for cooking. If the whole space is not firmly
filled after considerable use, more stuffing should be added. If a
covering is wanted for the stuffing, the simplest thing to use is a
sheet of very heavy paper, at least one inch larger than the top of box;
draw a circle in center of it the size of the pail. From center of
circle cut with sharp scissors to edge, to strike it at intervals of
about 1-1/2 inch. Fit paper over top of packing so that circle will come
just over nest for pail. Place pail in nest and it will crease the paper
down at exactly the right place.

Since it is very important for the food to be placed into the cooker
while it is still boiling, the box should be placed as near to the stove
as possible. Everything should be ready before the food is taken from
the fire; the cooker open and the cushion removed. The box must be kept
tightly closed from the time the food is put in until it is entirely
done. If it is necessary to open the box before appointed time, the
contents must be reheated to the boiling point before it is replaced.
Though the time necessary to cook the foods on the stove is very short,
they must be boiled until heated to the center. Thus the denser and
larger the food, the longer it will take to heat.


THE ADVANTAGES OF THE FIRELESS COOKER.

One of the advantages of the fireless cooker has been mentioned--the
small amount of cooking over a fire, which means a great saving of fuel
and attention. The housekeeper may put the food into the cooker and
forget about it until meal time comes, busying herself in the meantime
with other things, or perhaps leaving home. She knows that the food is
not being ruined by burning, and that it will come to the table with its
full flavor unimpaired.

The pails used in a fireless cooker are easier to clean than pans which
have had the food burned into them, and the kitchen is never made a
degree warmer by use of the cooker, which is certainly agreeable during
the hot summer weather, and even onions may be cooked without the odor
pervading the house.

Nearly all foods may be cooked in the fireless cooker except those which
have to be crisp or brown, though roast meat may be browned either
before placing in the cooker or when the process of cooking is nearly
finished. Cereals, one of the most wholesome foods known, are greatly
improved by use of the fireless cooker. The long cooking makes them more
digestible and gives them a flavor which they lack when cooked only
fifteen or twenty minutes.

Any person having a fair idea of the general principles of cooking will
need very little instruction for the successful use of the fireless
cooker. The following recipes do not pretend to cover the wide variety
of food possible to fireless cookery, but only give an idea in the
preparation of a few simple dishes that might be used for most any meal.


BEEF BROTH.

Wash one pound of lean beef from the shoulder or round. Chop the meat
fine and remove pieces of fat; put meat into a pint of cold water with
one-fourth teaspoon of salt and let it soak in a cold place for an hour.
Place meat in a small cooker pan set over a large cooker pail of hot
(but not boiling) water; heat the broth until it registers 165 degrees
Fahrenheit. Slip pails into cooker for half an hour. Strain through
coarse wire strainer, remove fat and serve at once in a heated cup. It
may be chilled or frozen to the consistency of mush.


ROLLED OATS.

Remove any husks or pieces from one cup of rolled oats. Put two and a
half cups of water, one teaspoon of salt and oats into a pan that fits
into a cooker pail. Boil until slightly thickened, stirring frequently;
put pan over a cooker pail of boiling water and put into a cooker for
from four to twelve hours. This is the ideal way to prepare rolled oats,
as it is almost impossible to cook it too long.


BOILED POTATOES.

Scrub potatoes with a small brush. Pare them and let them stand a while
in cold water. Cook them in a large amount of boiling salted water in a
cooker pail. When they have boiled one minute put them in the cooker for
from one and a half to three hours. New potatoes will not require so
long to cook as old.


BOILED FISH.

Put a three-pound fish or three pounds of small fish into four quarts of
boiling water to which four teaspoonfuls of salt have been added; set it
at once into a cooker for one hour.


POT ROAST.

Have the butcher bone and roll three pounds of beef rump; dredge it well
with salt, pepper and flour and brown it on all sides in a frying pan
with a little of the fat from the meat. Put the meat, three cups of
boiling water, one bay leaf, one small onion, salt and pepper, two small
carrots, two sprigs parsley, one-half teaspoon celery seed, a little
flour, one-half teaspoon Worcestershire sauce into a small cooker pail
and let it simmer thirty minutes; set in a large pail of boiling water
and put into a cooker for nine hours or more. Reheat it to boiling
point; strain; thicken the liquor for gravy.


RICE PUDDING.

Heat one quart of milk, one teaspoonful of butter, one-third cup of
rice, one-eighth teaspoon of grated nutmeg, one-eighth teaspoon of salt
and one-half cup of sugar in a pudding pan over a cooker pail of water.
When water boils remove pan and bring pudding also to a boil. When
boiling, replace pudding in large pan of boiling water, cover and put
into cooker for three or four hours. One-half cup of small unbroken
seeded raisins may be added to this recipe, and the pudding may be
browned in oven before serving, if desired.


STEWED CHICKEN.

Clean and cut up a chicken. Put it, with the giblets, in enough boiling
salted water to cover it--one teaspoonful of salt to each quart of
water. Let it boil for ten minutes and put it into a cooker for ten
hours or more. If not quite tender, bring it again to a boil and cook it
for six or eight hours, depending on its toughness. Skim off as much
fat from the liquor as possible, pour off some of the liquor to use as
soup or stock, and thicken the remainder with flour for gravy. A beaten
egg or two stirred into the gravy just before serving improves it. Add
pepper and salt to taste, and serve chicken on hot platter with gravy
poured around it.


SETTING THE TABLE.

A most important thing necessary to the enjoyment of life, and an actual
aid to digestion and the preservation of health, is that each person
should make up his or her mind to forget all but pleasant thoughts and
to put an absolute bar against the discussion of disagreeable subjects
while at the table. Then only can they appreciate the fact that the meal
has been carefully prepared and the table daintily set.

To cook an excellent meal and then serve it well makes the meal perfect.
First of all the table linen should be immaculate. The more inexpensive
linens are as attractive as the handsomest damasks when absolutely
spotless and snowy white. For the lighter meals, breakfast and luncheon,
a center piece and doilies may be used instead of the table cloth. The
silver should be polished frequently and glasses wiped out carefully
before placing on the table. A small fern or low bowl filled with
short-stemmed flowers in the center of the table gives a dainty, cozy
air, while the more elaborate vases may be used on more formal
occasions. Four shaded candles on the table, when there are side lights
in the dining room, cast a soft and pleasing light, far more agreeable
to the eyes than the usual chandelier.

The placing of the silver must, of course, suit the character of the
meal. If the meal is simple, the service should be simple. A good
arrangement for an ordinary dinner is to place the fork and teaspoon at
left of space allowed for plate, the knife and butter knife at the
right, the napkin on right side and coffee spoon at the top, with water
glass at the right and butter plate at left of each place. Various
articles may be added, such as oyster fork, bouillon spoon, salad fork
and so forth.


FOOD FOR, AND SERVING THE SICK.

The utmost care should be taken in cooking food for the invalid, so that
all of the flavor and delicacy of each dish may be preserved. We take it
for granted that the food is the best that can be had, and that absolute
cleanliness is used in preparation. But, really, the important thing is
to make the tray as attractive and dainty as possible, or the food will
not be tempting, no matter how carefully prepared.

The tray should have a fresh, white cover each time it is carried to the
sick room, and thin china of a pretty pattern should be used. In the
summer time any garden flower, laid on the fresh napkin beside the
plate, lends a cheerful note of color to the tray. Always serve small
portions, as a large helping does not look appetizing to sick, tired
eyes, and be careful in serving liquids not to spill any on the tray
cloth or saucer.

It is those little things that sometimes disgust the invalid with what
is put before him. There is a tidy and an untidy way of serving most
dishes, too; for instance, in serving a poached egg, have it piping hot
and on the toast; not cold, part on the toast and part on the saucer,
with the yolk broken.

So each detail should be carried out, and you will find your care and
attention rewarded by the invalid's interest in the tray, with its
tinkling china and savory dishes.

Invalids should have graham bread, and must not be permitted to eat
bread less than twenty-four hours old. Toast is a very good thing for
most sick people, and should be browned very slowly in order that it may
be dried through. It is then partially digested. It is best eaten dry.

Broths and soups are much used; oyster soup may be given, as well as
gruel made of oatmeal or barley. Soups made of vegetables must be
strained and served according to the doctor's orders.

Scraped beef is very nutritious, and is served raw between slices of
bread and butter. Baked and broiled fish are nice, and generally
relished by sick people.

Soft boiled and scrambled eggs are quite safe to give, as a rule.

If potatoes are liked, have them baked. Other vegetables may be given,
but it is always best to consult the physician before serving things
about which one is doubtful. Food that will not be harmful in some cases
may be decidedly so in others. Generally, it is best to avoid fried and
warmed-over meats, and pork should not be served to the sick.

Avoid unripe or overripe fruit. In serving oranges, remove the tough
part and give only the juice. Baked and stewed apples are to be
recommended; sometimes baked custard, and rice or other puddings. If any
stewed berries are to be used, be sure to strain them.

Coffee is good to use moderately in malarial troubles, and tea, not very
strong, may be used sparingly when the heart is not affected. Milk, when
it agrees with the patient, may be given. Lemonade and lemon water ice
are very refreshing and will often be taken when other drinks do not
seem tempting.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://www.gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
