PREFACE.


Some years ago the Smithsonian Institution printed a small vocabulary of
the Chinook Jargon, furnished by Dr. B.R. Mitchell, of the U.S. Navy, and
prepared, as we afterwards learned, by Mr. Lionnet, a Catholic priest, for
his own use while studying the language at Chinook Point. It was submitted
by the Institution, for revision and preparation for the press, to the
late Professor W.W. Turner. Although it received the critical examination
of that distinguished philologist, and was of use in directing attention
to the language, it was deficient in the number of words in use, contained
many which did not properly belong to the Jargon, and did not give the
sources from which the words were derived.

Mr. Hale had previously given a vocabulary and account of this Jargon in
his "Ethnography of the United States Exploring Expedition," which was
noticed by Mr. Gallatin in the Transactions of the American Ethnological
Society, vol. ii. He, however, fell into some errors in his derivation of
the words, chiefly from ignoring the Chihalis element of the Jargon, and
the number of words given by him amounted only to about two hundred and
fifty.

A copy of Mr. Lionnet's vocabulary having been sent to me, with a request
to make such corrections as it might require, I concluded not merely to
collate the words contained in this and other printed and manuscript
vocabularies, but to ascertain, so far as possible, the languages which
had contributed to it, with the original Indian words. This had become the
more important, as its extended use by different tribes had led to
ethnological errors in the classing together of essentially distinct
families. Dr. Scouler, whose vocabularies were among the earliest bases of
comparison of the languages of the northwest coast, assumed a number of
words, which he found indiscriminately employed by the Nootkans of
Vancouver Island, the Chinooks of the Columbia, and the intermediate
tribes, to belong alike to their several languages, and exhibit analogies
between them accordingly.[A] On this idea, among other points of fancied
resemblance, he founded his family of Nootka-Columbians,--one which has
been adopted by Drs. Pritchard and Latham, and has caused very great
misconception. Not only are those languages entirely distinct, but the
Nootkans differ greatly in physical and mental characteristics from the
latter. The analogies between the Chinook and the other native
contributors to the Jargon are given hereafter.

[Footnote A: Journal Royal Geographical Society of London, vol. xi.,
1841.]

The origin of this Jargon, a conventional language similar to the Lingua
Franca of the Mediterranean, the Negro-English-Dutch of Surinam, the
Pigeon English of China, and several other mixed tongues, dates back to
the fur droguers of the last century. Those mariners whose enterprise in
the fifteen years preceding 1800, explored the intricacies of the
northwest coast of America, picked up at their general rendezvous, Nootka
Sound, various native words useful in barter, and thence transplanted
them, with additions from the English, to the shores of Oregon. Even
before their day, the coasting trade and warlike expeditions of the
northern tribes, themselves a sea-faring race, had opened up a partial
understanding of each other's speech; for when, in 1792, Vancouver's
officers visited Gray's Harbor, they found that the natives, though
speaking a different language, understood many words of the Nootka.

On the arrival of Lewis and Clarke at the mouth of the Columbia, in 1806,
the new language, from the sentences given by them, had evidently attained
some form. It was with the arrival of Astor's party, however, that the
Jargon received its principal impulse. Many more words of English were
then brought in, and for the first time the French, or rather the Canadian
and Missouri patois of the French, was introduced. The principal seat of
the company being at Astoria, not only a large addition of Chinook words
was made, but a considerable number was taken from the Chihalis, who
immediately bordered that tribe on the north,--each owning a portion of
Shoalwater Bay. The words adopted from the several languages were,
naturally enough, those most easily uttered by all, except, of course,
that objects new to the natives found their names in French or English,
and such modifications were made in pronunciation as suited tongues
accustomed to different sounds. Thus the gutturals of the Indians were
softened or dropped; and the _f_ and _r_ of the English and French, to
them unpronounceable, were modified into _p_ and _l_. Grammatical forms
were reduced to their simplest expression, and variations in mood and
tense conveyed only by adverbs or by the context. The language continued
to receive additions, and assumed a more distinct and settled meaning,
under the Northwest and Hudson's Bay companies, who succeeded Astor's
party, as well as through the American settlers in Oregon. Its advantage
was soon perceived by the Indians, and the Jargon became to some extent a
means of communication between natives of different speech, as well as
between them and the whites. It was even used as such between Americans
and Canadians. It was at first most in vogue upon the lower Columbia and
the Willamette, whence it spread to Puget Sound, and with the extension of
trade, found its way far up the coast, as well as the Columbia and Fraser
rivers; and there are now few tribes between the 42d and 57th parallels of
latitude in which there are not to be found interpreters through its
medium. Its prevalence and easy acquisition, while of vast convenience to
traders and settlers, has tended greatly to hinder the acquirement of the
original Indian languages; so much so, that except by a few missionaries
and pioneers, hardly one of them is spoken or understood by white men in
all Oregon and Washington Territory. Notwithstanding its apparent poverty
in number of words, and the absence of grammatical forms, it possesses
much more flexibility and power of expression than might be imagined, and
really serves almost every purpose of ordinary intercourse.

The number of words constituting the Jargon proper has been variously
stated. Many formerly employed have become in great measure obsolete,
while others have been locally introduced. Thus, at the Dalles of the
Columbia, various terms are common which would not be intelligible at
Astoria or on Puget Sound. In making the following selection, I have
included all those which, on reference to a number of vocabularies, I have
found current at any of these places, rejecting, on the other hand, such
as individuals, partially acquainted with the native languages, have
employed for their own convenience. The total number falls a little short
of five hundred words.

An analysis of their derivations gives the following result:

Chinook, including Clatsop                       200
Chinook, having analogies with other languages    21
Interjections common to several                    8
Nootka, including dialects                        24
Chihalis, 32; Nisqually, 7                        39
Klikatat and Yakama                                2
Cree                                               2
Chippeway (Ojibwa)                                 1
Wasco (probably)                                   4
Kalapuya (probably)                                4
By direct onomatopoeia                             6
Derivation unknown, or undetermined               18
French, 90; Canadian, 4                           94
English                                           67

I had no opportunity of original investigation into the Nootka proper, but
from the few words in different published vocabularies, and from some
imperfect manuscript ones in my possession of the Tokwaht, Nittinat, and
Makah dialects, have ascertained the number above given. Some of the
unascertained words probably also belong to that language. Neither was I
able to collate the Wasco or Kalapuya, but have assigned them on the
opinion of others. The former, also called Cathlasco, the dialect of the
Dalles Indians, is a corrupted form of the Watlala or Upper Chinook. With
the Chihalis, Yakama, and Klikatat, and the Nisqually, I had abundant
means of comparison.

The introduction of the Cree and Chippeway words is of course due to the
Canadians. None have been derived from the Spanish, as their intercourse
with the Nootka and Makah Indians was too short to leave an impression.
Spanish words, especially those relating to horses or mules and their
equipments, have of late come into general use in Oregon, owing to
intercourse with California, but they form no part of the Jargon. It might
have been expected from the number of Sandwich Islanders introduced by the
Hudson's Bay company, and long resident in the country, that the Kanaka
element would have found its way into the language, but their utterance is
so foreign to the Indian ear, that not a word has been adopted.

In the nouns derived from the French, the definite article _le_, _la_, has
almost in every instance been incorporated into the word, and the same has
in one or two instances been prefixed to nouns not of French origin.
Besides the words created by direct onomatopoeia, there are quite a number
which are really Indian, but have their origin in the similarity of sound
to sense.

Dr. Scouler's analogy between the Nootkan and "Columbian," or Chinook, was
founded on the following words:

_English._           _Tlaoquatch and Nutka._   _Columbian._
 plenty,              *aya,                     *haya.
 no,                  *wik,                     *wake.
 water,                tchaak,                   chuck.
 good,                *hooleish,                *closh.
 bad,                 *peishakeis,              *peshak.
 man,                 *tchuckoop,                tillicham.
 woman,               *tlootsemin,              *clootchamen.
 child,               *tanassis,                *tanass.
 now,                  tlahowieh,                clahowiah.
 come,                *tchooqua,                *sacko.
 slave,                mischemas,               *mischemas.
 what are you doing   *akoots-ka-*mamook,        ekta-*mammok.
 what are you saying  *au-kaak-*wawa,            ekta-*wawa.
 let me see,          *nannanitch,              *nannanitch.
 sun,                 *opeth,                    ootlach.
 sky,                 *sieya,                   *saya.
 fruit,               *chamas,                  *camas.
 to sell,             *makok,                   *makok.
 understand,          *commatax,                *commatax.

But of these, none marked with an asterisk belong to the Chinook or any of
its dialects. The greater part of them are undoubtedly Nootkan, though
there are errors in the spelling and, in some instances, in the meaning.
Of the rest, the Nootkan _tchaak_ and the Chinook _tl'tsuk_ alone presents
an analogy. _Klahowiah_ does not mean "now," nor do I believe it is
Nootkan, in any sense. It is, as explained in the dictionary, the Chinook
salutation, "How do you," "Good-bye," and is supposed to be derived from
the word for _poor_, _miserable_. _Mischemas_ is not Chinook, and is
probably not Nootkan. With the exception of Franchere, whose short
vocabulary was published by Mr. Gallatin, and Mr. Hale, all the writers
mentioned by Ludwig who have given specimens of the Chinook language, have
presented it in its Jargon form, more or less mixed with the neighboring
ones, and with corruptions of French and English words. Mr. Swan, among
others, has been led into this error. The place of his residence,
Shoalwater Bay, is common ground of the Chinook and Chihalis Indians, and
the degraded remnants of the two tribes are closely intermarried, and use
both languages almost indifferently.

Setting aside interjections, common in a more or less modified form to
several adjoining tribes, twenty-one words of those given in this
vocabulary present noticeable analogies between the Chinook and other
native languages. They are as follows:

_English._         _Chinook._      _Hailtzuk and Belbella._
 salmon berries,    klalilli,       olalli.


_English._       _Chinook and Clatsop._    _Nootka._
                                           Jewitt and Cook.
 water,           tl'tsuk : tl'chukw,       chauk : chahak.


_English._    _Chinook._    _Cowlitz._    _Kwantlen._    _Selish._
 six,          takhum,       tukh'um,      tuckhum',      tackan.


_English._        _Chinook._    _Chihalis._    _Nisqually._
 deep,             kellippe,     kluputl,       klep
 glad,             kwan,                        kwal (_tame_)
 proud,            eyutl,                       juil.
 demon,            ichiatku,     tsiatko,       tsiatko.
 black bear,       eitchhut,                    chetwut.
 crow,             skaka,                       skaka.
 oyster,           klokhklokh,   chetlokh,      klokhklokh.
 game of "hands,"  itlokum,      setlokum.


_English._        _Chinook._    _Yakama and Klikatat._
 certainly,        nawitka,      n'witka.
 always,           kwanisum,     kwalisim.
 younger sister,   ats,          atse.
 road,             wehut,        wiet (_far_).
 barrel,           tamtulitsh,   tamolitsh.
 buffalo,          emusmus,      musmus.
 coyote,           italipus,     talipa (_gray fox_).
 mouse,            kholkhol,     khoilkhoil.
 bread,            tsapelil,     saplil.
 needle,           okwepowa,     kapus (_a pin_).

The Clatsop (Klatsop) is merely a dialect of the Chinook (Tchinuk); the
Cowlitz (Kaualitsk), Kwantlen, Chihalis (Tsihelis), and Nisqually
(N'skwali), are severally languages belonging to the Selish family. The
Yakama and Klikatat are dialects of one of the Sahaptin languages; and the
Tokwaht (Tokwat), Nittinat, and Makah (Maka), quoted in the dictionary,
are dialects of the Nootka (Nutka), of which the Hailtzuk or Belbella
(variously spelled Haeeltzuk and Hailtsa) is probably the northern type.
It thus appears that, with two or three exceptions, the analogies of the
Chinook, as contained in this vocabulary, are to be sought in the
immediately adjoining tongues, or those of languages belonging to the same
families with them; that these analogies, with perhaps one or two
exceptions, can by no means be considered radical, and that their
correspondence, or rather adoption, is easily accounted for by
neighborhood and habits of intermarriage. A much more remarkable
coincidence is the fact that two words included in this Jargon,--one from
the Nootkan, viz., _Mawitch_, a deer, venison; and the other Chinook,
_Mooluk_, an elk,--are also to be found in the Kowilth, the language of
Humboldt Bay, in California. As this bay was first discovered in the
winter of 1849-50, the words could not have been introduced by the fur
trappers.

With regard to the form into which this dictionary has been thrown, an
explanation is necessary. The Jargon must in some degree be regarded as a
written language, the orthography of which is English. In Mr. Hale's
vocabulary alone has one more scientific been attempted, and of several
other printed, and numerous manuscript dictionaries in circulation, M.
Lionnet's alone, that I have met with, is according to the French.
Although no fixed system of spelling exists among them, I have therefore
deemed it best to preserve for the Jargon words that which most distinctly
represents the common English pronunciation; while for the Indian
derivations, I have adopted that recommended by the Smithsonian
Institution in collecting Indian vocabularies, using the Italian sounds of
the vowels, and representing the guttural of the German _ich_ by _kh_.
This seemed the more proper, as the work would thereby be rendered of
practical use, independent of what philological value it may possess.

In collating the words of the present work and obtaining their
derivations, I have been assisted by a number of friends; among whom I
should specially mention Mr. Alexander C. Anderson, of Victoria, V.I., and
Mr. Solomon H. Smith, of Clatsop, Oregon.

~Mist-chi'-mas~, _n._ Quaere u. d. _A slave._ Dr. Scouler gives this word
as Nootka and Columbian. Mr. Hale makes it Chinook. It is certainly,
however, neither Chinook nor Chihalis; and Jewitt gives _kakoelth_ as
Nootka, while I find the Makah word _kotlo,_ and the Nittinat _kotl._

~Mit-ass~, _n._ Cree, MITAS. (Anderson.) _Leggings._ A word imported by
the Canadian French.

~Mit'-lite~, _v._ Chinook, MITLAIT. _To sit; sit down; stay at; reside;

occurs also in the Koquilth of Humboldt Bay.

~Moon~, _n._ English, idem. _The moon._ Ikt moon, _a month;_ sick moon,
_the wane or old moon._

~Moos'-moos~, _n._ Klikatat, MUSMUS; Chinook, EMUSMUS. _Buffalo; horned
cattle._ The word, slightly varied, is common to several languages. Mr.
Anderson derives it from the Cree word _moostoos,_ a buffalo, and supposes
it to have been imported by the Canadians; but Father Pandosy makes
_musmus_ Yakama.

~Moo'-Sum~, _v., n._ Chihalis, MUSAM. _To sleep; sleep._ Tikegh moosum,
_or_ olo moosum, _to be sleepy_ (literally, _to want, or be hungry for

MOITSH, _a deer;_ Nootka, MOOWATSH, a _bear_ (Jewitt). _A deer; venison._
Frequently used to signify a wild animal; as, huloima mowitch, _a strange

probably a misprint. Like _moolock,_ an elk, the word is found in the
Koquilth of Humboldt Bay.

food._ Muckamuck chuck, &c., _to drink water, or other liquid._ Neither

~Na-ah, _n._ Chinook, TLKANAA. _A mother._ (Hale.) Peculiar to the
Columbia, and now in fact obsolete, the Euglish MA'MA being used instead.

~Nah~, _interj._ Common to several languages. _Look here! I say!_ Nah
sikhs! _halloo, friend!_ Also used in common conversation to call
attention to some point not thoroughly understood. In the Yakama language,
it is the sign of the vocative; as, nah tehn! _O man._

~Nan'-itsh~, _v._ Quaere u. d. _To see; look; look for; seek._ Nanitsh!
_look there!_ kloshe nanitsh! _look out! take care!_ cultus nanitsh, _to
look round idly, or from curiosity only._ Mamook nanitsh, _to show._ The
word is neither Chinook nor Chihalis. Dr. Scouler gives _nannanitch_ as
Nootka and Columbian. It is possibly tbe former.

~Nau'-its~, _adv._ Chihalis, NOITSH. Mr. Hale gives this for _off shore;
on the stream._ It means, according to Mr. Anderson, the _sea-beach,_  and
is not properly a Jargon word.

~Na-wit'-ka~, _adv._ Chinook, idem; Klikatat and Yakama, N'WITKA. _Yes;
certainly; yes indeed; to be sure._ Nawitka wake nika kumtuks, _indeed I
don't know._ In answer to a negative question, many Indians use it as

Nawitka, _I did not._

~Nem, _n._ English, NAME. _A name._ Mamook nem, _to name, or call by
name._

~Ne si'-ka~, _pron._ Chinook, NISAIKA. _We; us; our._

~Ne'-whah.~ Chinook, NIWHA. It seems to be an adverb used, as is often the
case, as a verb, the meaning being _hither, come,_ or _bring it hither._
Ex. Newhah nika nanitsh, _here, let me see it._

~Ni'-ka~, _pron._ Chinook, NAIKA. _I; me; my; mine._

~Nose~, _n._ English, idem. _The nose;_ also, _a promontory._ Boat nose,
_the bow of a boat._

okook? _what is that?_ okook sun, _to-day;_ okook klaksta, _he who;_ okook
klaska, _they_ (being present). It is often abbreviated to _oke;_ as, _oke

the salmon berry. Chinook, KLALELLI, _berries in general. Berries._ Shot
olillie, _huckleberries;_ siahpult olillie, _raspberries;_ salmon olillie,
_salmon berries,_ &c. On Puget Sound, always called OLALLIE.

~Pa'see-sie~, _n._ Chinook, PASISI. _A blanket; woollen cloth._

~Pa-si'-ooks~, _n., adj._ Chinook, PASISIUKS. _French; a Frenchman._

Mr. Hale supposed this to be a corruption of the French word _Francais._
It is, however, really derived from the foregoing word, PASISI, with the
terminal UKS, which is a plural form applied to living beings. Lewis and
Clarke (vol. ii., p. 413) give _Pashisheooks,_ clothmen, as the Chinook
name for the whites, and this explanation was also furnished me by people
of that tribe. It has since been generally restricted to the French

This name, ludicrously enough, has been bestowed on the range of mountains
separating Oregon and California, and also on a county in the latter
State. The origin of this designation, as related to me by Mr. Anderson,
was as follows. Mr. Archibald R. McLeod, a chief factor of the Hudson's
Bay Company, in the year 1828, while crossing the mountains with a pack
train, was over-taken by a snow storm, in which he lost most of his
animals, including a noted bob-tailed race-horse. His Canadian followers,
in compliment to their chief, or "bourgeois," named the place the Pass of
the Siskiyou,--an appellation subsequently adopted as the veritable Indian
name of the locality, and which thence extended to the whole range, and
the adjoining district.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
