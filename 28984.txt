THE MORAL PIRATES.

BY WM. L. ALDEN.


CHAPTER II.

When Uncle John announced that the Department was satisfied with the
ability of the captain and crew to manage the _Whitewing_, the day for
sailing was fixed, and the boys laid in their stores. Each one had a
fishing-line and hooks, and Harry and Tom each took a fishing-pole--two
poles being as many as were needed, since most of the fishing would
probably be done with drop-lines. Uncle John lent Harry his
double-barrelled gun, and a supply of ammunition. Each boy took a tin
plate, a tin cup, knife, fork, and spoon. For cooking purposes, the boat
carried a coffee-pot, two tin cake-pans, which could be used as
frying-pans as well as for other purposes, and two small tin pails.
Harry's mother lent him several large round tin boxes, in which were
stored four pounds of coffee, two pounds of sugar, a pound of Indian
meal, a large quantity of crackers, some salt, and a little pepper. The
rest of the provisions consisted of two cans of soup, two cans of corned
beef, a can of roast beef, two small cans of devilled chicken, four cans
of fresh peaches, a little package of condensed beef for making beef
tea, and a cold boiled ham. The boat was furnished with an A tent, four
rubber blankets and four woollen blankets, a hatchet, a quantity of
spare cordage, a little bull's-eye lantern, which burnt olive-oil, and
a few copper nails, a pair of pliers, a small piece of zinc, a little
white lead, for mending a leak. Of course there was a bottle of oil for
the lantern; and Mrs. Schuyler added a box of pills and a bottle of
"Hamlin's Mixture" as medical stores. The boys wore blue flannel
trousers and shirts, and each one carried an extra pair of trousers, and
an extra shirt instead of a coat. These, with a few pairs of stockings
and two or three handkerchiefs, were all the clothing that they needed,
so Uncle John said; though the boys had imagined that they must take at
least two complete suits. He showed them that two flannel shirts worn at
the same time, one over the other, would be as warm as one shirt and a
coat, and that if their clothing became wet, it could be easily dried.
"Flannel and the compass are the two things that are indispensable to
navigation," said Uncle John. "If flannel shirts had not been invented,
Columbus would never have crossed the Atlantic." Perhaps there was a
little exaggeration in this; but when we remember that flannel is the
only material that is warm in cold weather and cool in hot weather, and
that dries almost as soon as it is wrung out and hung in the wind, it is
difficult to see how sailors could do without it.

The boys agreed very readily to take with them only what Uncle John
advised. Tom Schuyler, however, was very anxious to take a heavy iron
vise, which, he said, could be screwed on the gunwale of the boat, and
might prove to be very useful, although he could not say precisely what
he expected to use it for. Joe Sharpe also wanted to take a base-ball
and bat, but neither the vise nor the ball and bat were taken.

The _Whitewing_ started from the foot of East
One-hundred-and-twenty-seventh Street on a Monday morning in the middle
of July, at about nine o'clock. Quite a small crowd of friends were
present to see the boys off, and the neat appearance of the boat and her
crew attracted the attention of all the idlers along the shore. When all
the cargo was stowed, and everything was ready, Uncle John called the
boys aside, and said, "Now, boys, you must sign the articles."

"What are articles?" asked all the boys at once.

"They are certain regulations which every respectable pirate, or any
other sailor, for that matter, must agree to keep when he joins a ship.
I'll read the articles, and if any of you don't like any one of them,
say so frankly, for you must not begin a cruise in a dissatisfied state
of mind. Here are the articles:

"'I. _We, the captain and crew of the_ Whitewing, _promise to decide all
disputed questions by the vote of the majority, except questions
concerning the management of the boat. The orders of the captain, in all
matters connected with the management of the boat, shall be promptly
obeyed by the crew_.'

"Now if anybody thinks that the captain should not have the full control
of the boat, let him say so at once. Very likely the captain will make
mistakes; but the boat will be safer, even if the crew obeys a wrong
order, than it would be if every order should be debated by the crew.
You can't hold town-meetings when you are afloat. Harry, I think,
understands pretty well how to sail the boat. Will you agree to obey his
orders?"

All the boys said they would; and Joe Sharpe added that he thought the
captain ought to have the right to put mutineers in irons.

"That, let us hope, will not be necessary," said Uncle John. "Now listen
to the second article:

"'II. _We promise not to take corn, apples, or other property without
permission of the owner._'

"You will very likely camp near some field where corn, or potatoes, or
something eatable, is growing. Many people think there is no harm in
taking a few ears of corn or half a dozen apples. I want you to remember
that to take anything that is not your own, unless you have permission
to do so, is stealing. It's an ugly word, but it can't be smoothed over
in any way. Do you object to this article?"

Nobody objected to it. "We're moral pirates, Uncle John," said Tom
Schuyler, "and we won't disgrace the Department by stealing."

"I knew you would not except through thoughtlessness. Now these are all
the articles. I did think of asking you not to quarrel, or to use bad
language; but I don't believe it is necessary to ask you to make such a
promise, and if it were, you probably would not keep it. So sign the
articles, give them to the captain, and take your stations."

The articles were signed. The captain seated himself in the
stern-sheets, and took the yoke lines. The rest took their proper
places, and Joe Sharpe held the boat to the dock by the boat-hook. "Are
you all ready?" cried Uncle John.

"All ready, sir!" answered Harry.

"Then give way with your oars! Good-by, boys, and don't forget to send
reports to the Department."

The boat glided away from the shore with Tom and Jim each pulling a
single oar. The group on the wharf gave the boys a farewell cheer, and
in a few moments they were hid from sight by the Third Avenue Bridge.
The tide was against them, but the day was a cool one for the season,
and the boys rowed steadily on in the very best of spirits. There was a
light south wind, but as there were several bridges to pass, Harry
thought it best not to set the sail before reaching the Hudson River. It
required careful steering to avoid the steamboats, bridge piles, and
small boats; but the _Whitewing_ was guided safely, and her signal--a
red flag with a white cross--floated gayly at the bow.

Uncle John had made one serious mistake: he had forgotten all about the
tide, and never thought of the difficulty the boys would find in passing
Farmers-bridge with the tide against them. They had passed High Bridge,
and had entered a part of the river with which the boys were not
familiar, when Joe Sharpe suddenly called out, "There's a low bridge
right ahead that we can't pass." A few more strokes of the oars enabled
Harry to see a long low bridge, which completely blocked up the river
except at one place, that seemed not much wider than the boat. Through
this narrow channel the tide was rushing fiercely, the water heaping
itself up in waves that looked unpleasantly high and rough. The boat was
rowed as close as possible to the opening under the bridge; but the
current was so strong that the boys could not row against it, and even
if they had been able to stem it, the channel was too narrow to permit
them to use the oars.

Harry ordered the boat to be rowed up to the bridge at a place where
there was a quiet eddy, and all the crew went ashore to contrive some
way of overcoming the difficulty. Presently Harry thought of a plan. "If
we could get the painter under the bridge, we could pull the boat
through easy enough if there was nobody in her."

"That's all very well," said Joe, "but how are you going to get the
painter through?"

"I know," cried Jim. "Let's take a long piece of rope and drop it in the
water the other side of the bridge. The current will float it through,
and we can catch it and tie it to the painter."

The plan seemed a good one; and so the boys took a piece of spare rope
from the boat, tied a bit of board to one end of it for a float, dropped
the float into the water, and held on to the other end of the rope. When
the float came in sight below the bridge they caught it with the
boat-hook, and throwing away the piece of board, tied the rope to the
painter. "Now let Joe Sharpe get in the bow of the boat, to keep her
from running against anything, and we'll haul her right through,"
exclaimed Harry.

Joe took his place in the bow, and pushing the boat off, let her float
into the current. Then the three other boys pulled on the rope, and
were delighted to see the boat glide under the bridge. Suddenly Joe gave
a wild yell. "She's sinking, boys!" he cried: "let go the rope, or I'll
be drowned!" The boys, terribly frightened, dropped the rope, and in
another minute the boat floated back on the current, half full of water,
and without Joe. Almost as soon as it came in sight, Harry had thrown
off his shoes and jumped into the river.

MR. MARTIN'S GAME.

BY JIMMY BROWN.


What if he is a great deal older than I am! that doesn't giv him any
right to rumple my hair, does it? I'm willing to respect old age, of
course, but I want my hair respected too.

But rumpling hair isn't enough for Mr. Martin; he must call me "Bub,"
and "Sonny." I might stand "Sonny," but I won't stand being called "Bub"
by any living man--not if I can help it. I've told him three or four
times, "My name isn't 'Bub,' Mr. Martin. My name's Jim, or Jimmy," but
he would just grin in an exhausperating kind of way, and keep on calling
me "Bub."

My sister Sue doesn't like him any better than I do. He comes to see her
about twice a week, and I've heard her say, "Goodness me, there's that
tiresome old bachelor again." But she treats him just as polite as she
does anybody; and when he brings her candy, she says, "Oh, Mr. Martin,
you are _too_ good." There's a great deal of make-believe about girls, I
think.

Now that I've mentioned candy, I will say that he might pass it around,
but he never thinks of such a thing. Mr. Travers, who is the best of all
Sue's beaux, always brings candy with him, and gives me a lot. Then he
generally gives me a quarter to go to the post-office for him, because
he forgot to go, and expects something very important. It takes an hour
to go to the post-office and back, but I'd do anything for such a nice
man.

One night--it was Mr. Travers's regular night--Mr. Martin came, and
wasn't Sue mad! She knew Mr. Travers would come in about half an hour,
and she always made it a rule to keep her young men separate.

She sent down word that she was busy, and would be down stairs after a
while. Would Mr. Martin please sit down and wait. So he sat down on the
front piazza and waited.

I was sitting on the grass, practicing mumble-te-peg a little, and
by-and-by Mr. Martin says, "Well, Bub, what are you doing?"

"Playing a game," says I. "Want to learn it?"

"Well, I don't care if I do," says he. So he came out, and sat in the
grass, and I showed him how to play.

Just then Mr. Travers arrived, and Sue came down, and was awfully glad
to see both her friends. "But what in the world are you doing," she says
to Mr. Martin. When she heard that he was learning the game, she said,
"How interesting, do play one game."

Mr. Martin finally said he would. So we played a game, and I let him
beat me very easy. He laughed fit to kill himself when I drew the peg,
and said it was the best game he ever played.

"Is there any game you play any better than this, Sonny?" said he, in
his most irragravating style.

"Let's have another game," said I. "Only you must promise to draw the
peg fair, if I beat you."

"All right," said he. "I'll draw the peg if you beat me, Bub."

Oh, he felt so sure he was a first-class player! I don't like a
conceited man, no matter if he is only a boy.

You can just imagine how quick I beat him. Why, I went right through to
"both ears" without stopping, and the first time I threw the knife over
my head it stuck in the ground.

I cut a beautiful peg out of hard wood--one of those sharp, slender pegs
that will go through anything but a stone. I drove it in clear out of
sight, and Mr. Martin, says he, "Why, Sonny, nobody couldn't possibly
draw that peg."

"I've drawn worse pegs than that," said I. "You've got to clear away the
earth with your chin and front teeth, and then you can draw it."

"That is nonsense," says Mr. Martin, growing red in the face.

"This is a fair and square game," says I, "and you gave your word to
draw the peg if I beat you."

"I do hope Mr. Martin will play fair," said Sue. "It would be too bad to
cheat a little boy."

So Mr. Martin laid down and tried it, but he didn't like it one bit.
"See here, Jimmy," said he, "I'll give you half a dollar, and we'll
consider the peg drawn."

"That is bribery and corruption," said I. "Mr. Martin, I can't be
bribed, and didn't think you'd try to hire me to let you break your
promise."

When he saw I wouldn't let up on him, he laid down again and went to
work.

It was the best fun I ever knew. I just rolled on the ground and laughed
till I cried. Sue and Mr. Travers didn't roll, but they laughed till Sue
got up and ran into the house, where I could hear her screaming on the
front-parlor sofa, and mother crying out, "My darling child, where does
it hurt you, won't you have the doctor, Jane do bring the camphor."

Mr. Martin gnawed away at the earth, and used swear-words to himself,
and was perfectly raging. After a while he got the peg, and then he got
up with his face about the color of a flower-pot, and put on his hat,
and went out of the front gate rubbing his face with his handkerchief,
and never so much as saying good-night. He didn't come near the house
again for two weeks.

Mr. Travers gave me a half-dollar to go to the post-office to make up
for the one I had refused, and told me that I had displayed roaming
virtue, though I don't know exactly what he meant.

He looked over this story, and corrected the spelling for me, and told
me to send it to the YOUNG PEOPLE. Only it is to be a secret that he
helped me. I'd do almost anything for him, and I'm going to ask Sue to
marry him just to please me.




A CHAT ABOUT PHILATELY.

BY J. J. CASEY.


Philately? What is that?

Many years ago, beyond the longest recollection of the oldest of the
young people, a school-teacher in Paris (so one story goes) advised her
pupils to get specimens of different postage stamps, in order the better
to study their geography. There was a general searching among old
letters to secure these little bits of bright-colored papers. Parents
and friends were asked to save the stamps from their letters; strangers
at the post-office were pounced upon, the moment they received their
letters, for the stamps; and from this little beginning sprang
stamp-collecting.

At first it was limited to boys and girls; but the older people, seeing
the interest excited over these little pictures, and led on by their
endeavors to please their young acquaintances, began themselves taking
an interest in the things. From a pleasure it gradually became a study,
and a most fascinating one; and soon there were no more enthusiastic
collectors than the people advanced in years, wealth, position, and
social, literary, and scientific attainments. And to-day many great
people turn with pleasure from the cares of their life to the pages of
their stamp albums, to look over the numerous evidences of the growth
of the postal system, or to help some young friend in the filling up of
a modest little blank-book.

In spite of the ridicule which has been heaped upon the collector of
stamps, the interest in stamp-collecting is as great to-day as it was a
dozen years ago, and from Prince Edward Island to Australia will be
found stamp "merchants," as they delight to call themselves, stamp
papers, and stamp agencies, to supply the continually increasing demands
of young and old collectors. Societies exist in several countries, at
the meetings of which most learned papers are read to show the why and
the wherefore of this or that stamp, and even the government at
Montevideo has authorized a stamp society, lately established there, to
use a private postal card.

This pursuit of stamp collecting is called Philately, from two Greek
words, which have been translated "the love of stamps," and those who
engage in the pleasure or the pursuit are pleased to call themselves
Philatelists.

This little "chat" shall be closed by a reference to the illustrations
of some curious or interesting stamps, and a notice of stamps that have
been issued during the past few months.

[Illustration: FIG. 1.]

Fig. 1 is one of the series of United States stamps for postage on large
packages of newspapers and periodicals, and represents a value of
forty-eight dollars. There is a higher value of sixty dollars. These
stamps are perfect gems, and are among the most beautiful in the world.

[Illustration: FIG. 2.]

Fig. 2 represents one of the stamps in use to-day in Japan. It is only
necessary to compare a specimen of this issue with the first stamps used
in Japan to see how rapidly the Japanese acquire every modern
improvement.

[Illustration: FIG. 3.]

Fig. 3 is one of the current Guatemala stamps, printed in Paris, which
found their way to collectors before they were delivered to the
government. The thick black line on either side is a bird's tail--the
quezal, or national bird, one of the most beautiful on this continent.

[Illustration: FIG. 4.]

[Illustration: FIG. 5.]

Figs. 4 and 5 represent stamps used in two of the native states of
India. The native stamps of India, ugly as many of them are, are among
the most interesting found in the collector's album, and quite difficult
to obtain.

[Illustration: FIG. 6.]

Fig. 6 is one from the South African Republic, or the Transvaal, lately
seized by England.

Some of the newest issues are:

     ANTIGUA.--A new value, 4_d_., blue; and a postal card, 1-1/2_d_.,
     red-brown on buff.

     CAPE OF GOOD HOPE.--The 4_d_., blue, surcharged in red above,
     "Three Pence."

     DOMINICA.--New values of 1/2_d_., yellow; 2-1/2_d_., brown; 4_d_.,
     blue; and a postal card of 1-1/2_d_., red-brown.

     DANISH WEST INDIES.--A new value, 50_c_., same type as current
     series, in mauve.

     GOLD COAST.--Stamps of 1/2_d_., golden yellow, and 2_d_., green;
     and card of 1-1/2_d_., red-brown.

     GREAT BRITAIN.--The 2-1/2_d_. stamp is printed in blue, and the
     2_s_. changes from blue to red-brown.

     MONTSERRAT.--New stamps of 2-1/2_d_., red-brown, and 4_d_., blue;
     and postal card of 1-1/2_d_., red-brown.

     NEVIS.--New stamps of 2-1/2_d_., red-brown, and 4_d_., blue; and
     postal card of 1-1/2_d_., red-brown.

     PERU.--A new series of stamps is in preparation, but for the
     present the authorities surcharge the current stamp with the
     words, "Union Postale Universelle" and "Plata," in an oval. The
     1_c_. changes its color to green, the 2_c_. to carmine, and the
     20_c_. is suppressed.

     ROUMELIA.--This province of Turkey begins its stamp history with a
     postal card of the value of 10 paras, as expressed on the face,
     but in reality of 15 paras, at which it is sold.




BUTTERFLIES AND BEES.


  Butterflies are merry things,
  Gayly painted are their wings,
  And they never carry stings.
  Bees are grave and busy things,
  Gold their jackets, brown their wings,
  And _they always_ carry stings.
  Yet--isn't it extremely funny?--
  Bees, not butterflies, make honey.




[Illustration: GATHERING THE WATER-CRESSES.]

AN APRONFUL OF WATER-CRESSES.

BY MARGARET EYTINGE.


Cissy Mount came down to the gurgling, sparkling little brook at the
foot of the hill, where Frank Hillborn and his brother Dave were
gathering water-cresses.

"I'm going to Fairview, Frank," she said, "and came to ask you if you
would look in on mother by-and-by, and see if she needs anything."

"Of course I will," said Frank. "But you're not going to walk to
Fairview, Cissy? That's a long tramp for a girl."

"Yes, I am," she replied. "There's no other way I can go. Nobody that I
know ever drives down there. Mother wants me to try and get her some
sewing to do. You know there are five or six big stores there, and
mother can sew and knit beautifully. I wish I had time to pick some wild
flowers to take with me. Town-people like wild flowers."

"A good many of them like something fresh and green to eat better than
they do wild flowers," said Frank; "so you just take along some of these
water-cresses. Aren't they beauties? They're the first we've gathered
this spring, and I hope they'll bring you luck."

"But I have no basket," said Cissy.

"Carry them in your apron. They won't hurt;" and as she held it up, he
heaped it full of moist green bunches.

"That's just like you, Frank Hillborn," said Dave, when the girl had
gone. "What's the good of our owning the only water-cress brook for
miles if you're going to give 'em away to everybody that comes along?"

"Everybody that comes along?" repeated Frank, with a cheery laugh. "I've
only given a basketful to Ezra Lee--he lent us his fishing-line when we
lost ours--and an apronful to Cissy Mount. Poor Cissy! Guess there's
hard times at her house since her father was killed on the railroad and
her mother got lame. And you know she's going to ask for work, and it
most always puts folks in good-humor if you carry 'em something nice."

"All right," said Dave; "but don't you give away any more, for we want
to make five dollars out of 'em this season, anyhow."

Cissy Mount walked bravely on mile after mile, until half of her
journey had been accomplished. Then she stopped and looked around for a
place where she might rest awhile. A pleasant little lane, on either
side of which stood a row of tall cedar-trees, branched off from the
main road. Into this lane she turned, and sat down on the grass near the
side gate of a fine garden. And as she sat there peeping through a hole
in the hedge at some lovely beds of hyacinths and tulips, radiant in the
sunshine, a queer-looking little old gentleman, with no hat on, but
having a wonderful quantity of brown hair, came scolding down the garden
path, followed by a man carrying a camp-chair. The old gentleman as he
talked grew more and more excited, and at last, to Cissy's great
astonishment, grasped the abundant brown locks, lifted them completely
off his head, waved them in the air an instant, and then gravely
replaced them. As he came near, the child could hear what he was saying:
"I sent word from Europe when this place was bought that if there were
no water-cress stream upon it, one was to be made at once. That's a year
ago."

"Beg pardon, sir," said the man, humbly, "but I did my best, sir. It
isn't my fault, sir. Sometimes you can't _make_ water-cresses grow, all
you can do, sir."

"And what's to be done with the puddle--for it's nothing but a puddle,
though a big one--that you've disfigured my grounds with?" asked the old
gentleman.

"Miss Grace says it will be a capital place for raising water-lilies,
sir," said the man.

"Oh, indeed! Very fine. But I can't eat water-lilies. There's no pepper
about them, and it's the pepper I want."

"Perhaps I can find some cresses for sale somewhere near, sir. Shall I
go and look, sir?"

"No," snarled the master. "By the time you came back with them, if you
got them, ten chances to one I shouldn't want them. When I want things,
I want them at once. Yes, I'd give five dollars for some fresh
water-cresses this very minute;" and he again seized his wig and
flourished it in the air.

With trembling fingers Cissy opened the gate, and walked in. The
servant-man placed the camp-chair on the ground. The old gentleman sat
down in it, first hanging his hair on the back, leaving his head as
smooth and shining as an ivory ball, looked at the intruder with keen
black eyes, and asked, sharply, "Well, what do _you_ want?"

"To give you these water-cresses," she said, with a smile, holding up
her apron. "They were gathered only a short time ago, and my apron's
quite clean, sir."

"Bless me!" exclaimed the old gentleman, "what a wonderful coincidence!
and"--taking a bunch and beginning to eat them--"what fine
water-cresses! And I suppose you expect that five dollars, for of course
you heard what I said."

"No, sir," said Cissy, shyly, "I never thought of the money. I know you
only said that as people often say things. I'm glad to give them to you,
sir, because you wanted them so much."

The old gentleman burst into a loud laugh, put on his wig, and asked her
name. And then by degrees he got the whole story from her--the death of
the father, the accident that lamed the mother, the gift of the cresses
from Frank Hillborn, and the five miles yet to go in search of work.
"And what was your mother's name before she was married?" was his last
question.

"Prudence Kelly, sir."

"Prudence Kelly! I knew it!" he shouted, springing from his chair. And
then, in a still louder voice, he called, "Grace! Grace!" and a pretty
young lady came running toward him. "I've found your old nurse, my dear,
your faithful old nurse that we have lost sight of for years. This is
her daughter. And she is in want. Take the carriage and go to her at
once. What a blessing that I got up in a scolding humor this morning,
and wanted water-cresses! Go with Grace, Cecilia my child, and when you
get home, give this five-dollar bill to your friend Frank, and tell him
it isn't the first time a little act of kindness has brought luck."

THE STORY OF GEORGE WASHINGTON.

BY EDWARD CARY.


CHAPTER IX.

Very soon after General Washington was elected President a war broke out
between France and England. It was natural that people in this country
should wish to help the French, who had helped us. But General
Washington saw that if we once got in the way of taking a part in wars
between other countries, where our own rights were not in danger, we
should always be at war. He saw, too, that we were a small nation then,
compared to the nations of Europe, and that we might easily lose the
freedom we had fought so long for. He dreaded to put our freedom in
danger unless compelled to. So he issued an order to the people, as he
had a right to do, not to take part with one nation or the other, but to
mind their own business.

This was wise, because the British government was only too ready to pick
a quarrel with us. General Washington also went further. He made a
treaty of peace and commerce with Great Britain, which kept war from our
shores for twenty years, and gave the country a chance to grow. The
people did not like this treaty much. There was a great deal of
ill-feeling toward Great Britain, growing out of the long fight we had
had with her. But General Washington, who was ready to fight for real
rights, felt that it was wrong to get into a quarrel from mere angry
feeling. He was very anxious to keep the two countries at peace until
their people could get calm, and go to trading with each other, and
learn to live together in friendship. Surely this was both sensible and
good. It was fortunate for the country that a man was at the head of its
government wise enough to see what was right, and firm enough to do it.

Just at the time Washington was elected President, the French people
rose against their government, which had many faults, and drove away
many of their rulers, and cut off their King's head. Among the leaders
was Lafayette, who, however, was no party to the cruelties which were
practiced. The other kings of Europe undertook to restore the King of
France to power, and in the war which followed Lafayette was taken
prisoner and closely confined. His wife wrote to Washington, asking him
to try and get Lafayette released. Washington gladly did all that he
could, but it was of no use. However, he sent money to Madame Lafayette,
for her property had been taken away, and he brought over to this
country one of Lafayette's sons, and took him into his family, and cared
for him as if he were his own. The boy was named after Washington, and
always remembered the President's kindness with thankfulness.

When the first term of four years for which Washington was elected came
to an end, he was chosen again, without a single vote against him,
though he was very anxious to go back to private life.

Finally, at the end of his second term, when he had been eight years
President, he refused to serve any longer. Just as he had written a
farewell address to his soldiers, after being eight years in command, he
now wrote a farewell address to the American people. I hope all my young
readers will read it as soon as they are old enough to understand it. It
is written in a quaint and somewhat stiff style, for Washington always
found it easier to act than to talk or write; but it is full of wisdom.
Even now, eighty-four years after it was written, there is much in it
which we ought to remember and try to carry out.

It was the spring of 1797 when Washington gave up the President's
office, and returned to Mount Vernon. He had visited his beloved home
frequently during his Presidency, and had kept a very careful watch over
it in his absence. Again he took up with great delight the old round of
peaceful duties. Every day he was up before the sun. Every day he was in
the saddle, riding over his large farms, watching his laborers and his
crops, planning changes and directing work. In the evening he saw much
company--many, indeed, who had little claim on him, who came from idle
curiosity, and wearied him with their presence. But he was always
courteous. He enjoyed the society of his family and friends very keenly.
He had no children of his own, but he had reared first the children, and
afterward two of the grandchildren, of his wife in his home. He took
great pleasure with them, and was as merry as he was loving. He hoped to
live the remainder of his days in quiet in this circle.

LITTLE FATIMA.

BY SARA KEABLES HUNT.


It was a beautiful Oriental picture, and I paused in my walk along the
banks of the Nile to sketch her, that dark-eyed Arab girl, as she half
reclined in the sand, the western sunlight flickering through the green
boughs of a clump of palms, and falling upon the upturned face and
purplish braids with their glitter of gold coins. In the background were
a few broken columns, relic of some past grandeur, and at a little
distance a camel crouched in the sand, gazing as mournfully as the
Sphynx across the desert. The flowing Eastern dress of the child was
pushed back from one beautifully rounded arm, but the other was
concealed, as if she had tried to hide it from even the sunlight. It was
crippled and pitifully deformed.

Poor little Fatima! I knew her sensitive spirit, and I put my pencil out
of sight as I came nearer, for I saw on her face the shadow of a
restless discontent. She smiled as she bade me welcome, but it was a sad
smile, and changed to tears as she spoke.

"I am of no use," she said in Arabic. "If I were a boy, they would care
for me; but a girl! They scorn me and my disfigured arm. I can never do
any good in the world; never, never. And, oh, lady, there is a soul
within me that longs to do something for somebody! I want to accomplish
something; not to sit here day after day making figures in the sand,
only to see them drift back again into a dull level. But I shall live in
vain. What can I do with this poor crippled arm?"

It was a difficult task to soothe her; but I think, after awhile, she
felt that the great Allah had done all things well, and peace crept over
her tired little heart.

"But, dear child," I said, as I left her, "it may be that you can do
more good with your one arm than I ever can with my two. We do not know
what may happen."

And so I went home to my little cottage, taking the field path instead
of the railroad track, as I usually did. When I reached the house, and
called for my little girl-baby, who often came toddling out to meet me,
all was silent, and in answer to my inquiries the nurse said she had
just gone down the track a little way to meet me.

"Down the track! Oh, the train! the train! It's time for the train! Why
do you stand here idle? Call Hassan and Mahomet. Run, and save her!"

I rushed wildly along the embankment. How plain it all is to me now,
even to the bits of pottery gleaming in the sand, and the distant echo
of an Arab's song as it floated over the hills! I saw the white dress
of my darling far ahead, and stumbled on--how, I hardly knew. The train
was coming! I could hear it plunging on; I could see the fearful light.
Oh, if I might reach her!

But who is that? Can it be Fatima? It is Fatima, waving her arms wildly
as she speeds onward. She is on the bank! She is there! She grasps the
child! And the train plunges past me with a wild glare; and there,
before me, is my baby, my golden-haired baby, safe and unharmed, but
Fatima lay dying on the iron rail. I clasped her to my heart, and called
her name amid my sobs. She lifted the long, dark eyelashes, and smiled.
"Allah be praised!" she murmured. Then in her weak, broken English she
said:

"Me do something wid dis poor arm; me die for you baby!" She fell back
in my arms; and so we carried her to my home, white and insensible.

But she did not die. The deformed arm had to be severed from the
shoulder, but her life was saved; and to-day, surrounded by all that
grateful hearts can give, she is one of the happiest little creatures on
the banks of the Nile.




A ST. ULRIC DOLL.

BY THE AUTHOR OF "THE CATSKILL FAIRIES."


The steam-ship _Columbine_ was crossing the ocean from Liverpool to New
York. On the deck the passengers walked about, looking at the sea and
sky. Occasionally they saw a flock of gulls circling about overhead, or
a shoal of dolphins leaping up in the blue waves. Among these passengers
was the shy gentleman. Now the shy gentleman was tall and large, with a
full brown beard, which should have made him quite bold, but he was not.
If a stranger spoke to him, he blushed, and if he tried to say something
really wise, he merely stammered, so that his meaning was lost. As for
tea-cups and wine-glasses, he always broke them with his elbow, or by
allowing them to slip through his big fingers, while chairs and little
tables seemed placed in his way for the sole purpose of his tumbling
over them.

In his cabin was his portmanteau, filled with all sorts of treasures. A
Paris doll and her wardrobe were given the place of honor. The beautiful
blonde hair of this fashionable lady must not be disarranged, and the
boxes containing her dresses and gloves, her boots, mantles, and
parasols, required much space. She was a very important person. In a
corner was wedged the case of one of those mechanical bears covered with
black fur, and wound up by means of a key in his side. In the opposite
corner were the Venetian lion of St. Mark, made of brass, trinkets of
straw and glass, and a little Neapolitan boy in mosaic on the lid of a
box. The St. Ulric doll, folded in a bit of tissue-paper, had been
allowed to fall down anywhere. She was made of a single stick of wood,
with a head carved on top, but without arms or legs, like the Italian
babies, who are wound about with cloths until they resemble little
mummies.

She remained quietly where she had been placed, between a flannel
waistcoat and a pair of stockings, with her head resting on a meerschaum
pipe. She thought of her home, and sighed. Yes, she was homesick,
because she loved her own land as only the Tyrolese and the Swiss love
their native mountains.

The shy gentleman had bought the St. Ulric doll at a booth under the
stone archway of one of the streets of Botzen. He could not carry away
with him the beautiful Austrian Tyrol, except as pictures in his own
mind, and therefore he picked up the droll and ugly little St. Ulric
doll.

"When I give the doll to Nelly, I will tell her about the mountain peaks
where the hunters climb to shoot the chamois and the black-cock, and the
valleys down toward Italy where the grapes ripen, and all about the
castles perched like watch-towers along the Brenner route," thought the
shy gentleman, wrapping the purchase in the bit of tissue-paper. "I must
not forget to add that this Brenner Pass, where the traveller of to-day
journeys on the railway from Munich to Verona, is one of the oldest
highways in the world; the Etruscan merchants used to pass here, trading
in iron with the Northern nations, long before the Romans."

One day a tremendous rattling was heard inside the case of the
mechanical bear.

"What is the matter? Are you seasick?" inquired the lion of St. Mark.

"No," grumbled the mechanical bear. "I have been standing on my head too
long, and if this voyage does not soon end, my machinery will be out of
order. I shall growl at the wrong time."

"We must be gifts for children. I hope they will like us," said the St.
Ulric doll.

"I hope we shall like _them_," said the French doll. "I come from a shop
window on the Boulevard des Italiens. How can I live out of Paris!"

Just then the lid of the portmanteau was lifted, and a Custom-house
officer looked in. The steamer had reached New York.

"Here he is, mamma!" cried a little girl, as a carriage paused before
the door of a house on Gramercy Square.

She had been looking out of the window. Now she ran down stairs, and
opened the front door. Two gentlemen got out of the carriage; one was
her uncle Fred, and the other a traveller with a brown beard, whose arms
were full of mysterious parcels and boxes. This was the shy gentleman,
and Nelly had always found him a good friend. Soon the parcels were
distributed. The mosaic box was for mother, the brass lion for Uncle
Fred, and all the rest for Nelly. She was wild with delight. The Paris
doll fascinated her. All her friends were invited to admire the lady
from the Boulevards. Nelly could not eat, or sleep, or study her
lessons. She tried on all the dresses, gloves, bonnets, and shoes.

The St. Ulric doll had been glanced at, laid on the table, and
forgotten. At length Nelly wearied of so much splendor, and her mother
found the Paris doll too fine for every-day play. Nelly noticed the St.
Ulric doll then.

"You have no clothes, poor thing," she said.

She opened her own work-box, sought in a bag for a piece of blue
flannel, and began to sew. Soon the St. Ulric doll was clothed. To be
sure, her gown was like a bag tied about her neck.

Nelly's mother, a pretty widow, said, "I did not know he loved me."

Nelly whispered to the St. Ulric doll that her mother was to marry the
shy gentleman.

"I thought there was a good reason for bringing us across the sea," said
the St. Ulric doll to the mechanical bear and the Paris lady.

The latter was out of temper.

"Already the little girl loves you best, because she has made your gown
herself," she said.




THE GRIZZLY BEAR.


The grizzly bear is the most terrible of all beasts. Its great strength,
its enormous size, its ferocity, and its courage render it a more
formidable enemy than the lion. It ranges the westward-lying slopes of
the Rocky Mountains from Mexico to British America, and is a constant
terror to the regions it inhabits.

The average length of the grizzly bear is about seven feet, and its
weight nine hundred to a thousand pounds, although much larger specimens
have been killed in Arizona and other Southern regions.

Grizzlies do not often attack men unless surprised or infuriated, or
driven by desperate hunger to seize upon everything which crosses their
path; but all animals, from a mouse to an enormous buffalo, fall an
easy prey to this monarch of the far West.

[Illustration: GRIZZLY BEAR AND BUFFALOES.]

The immense daring of the grizzly bear, and its entire confidence in its
strength, are evident from the fact that it will not hesitate to attack
buffaloes even when a whole herd are together. It has been known to kill
a buffalo with one blow of its terrible fore-paw, and afterward to drag
it away and bury it. It can easily dig a hole with its cimeter-like
claws, and it usually buries what it can not devour, as a store to fall
back upon when provisions are scarce.

Hunters tell many stories of sharp contests between grizzlies and
buffaloes. The bear will prowl by the side of a herd, keeping under
cover of the bushes until some big fat fellow comes within easy reach,
when it rushes on its victim, and with one blow fells it to the ground.
The other buffaloes may rush to the rescue of their comrade, but the
powerful grizzly is generally a match for them all, and instances are
rare where the savage beast has been driven to crawl away defeated.

The claws of this beast are longer than a man's finger, and are very
much prized as ornaments by the Indians. To wear a necklace of bear's
claws, taken from an animal killed by himself, is one of the highest
ambitions of an Indian brave; for if he is thus decorated, his courage
and superior strength are acknowledged by his whole tribe. An Indian
will sell his horses, his blankets, everything he possesses, but nothing
can induce him to part with his bear-claw necklace, which marks him as
an invincible warrior. To obtain this coveted prize Indians will run the
most extreme risks. Are the enormous foot-prints of a grizzly discovered
in the vicinity of the camp, the men all set out in hot pursuit, and
many a poor Indian has lost his life in fierce encounter with this
monarch of the mountains. If the bear can be traced to its den among the
rocks, the Indians will lay trails of powder leading from the lair in
different directions, which, as they burn, set fire to the dry grass and
stubble. As the animal, startled by the smoke and flame, rushes from its
hiding-place, the Indians, who lie concealed behind rocks and bushes,
pelt it with blazing pine knots, and fire volley after volley from their
rifles into its body, until some lucky shot enters the heart or brain,
and the monster staggers and falls dead to the ground.

This beast has a strong hold on life, and has often been known to run
with great speed, and even to swim deep rivers, with twenty or more
large rifle-balls in its body. It is so difficult to kill, and so
furious when aroused, that a hunter will never attack the grizzly
single-handed if the encounter can be avoided. The hunter may escape by
climbing a tree; for although young grizzlies can climb like a cat, the
old bears can do nothing more than stand on their hind-legs in vain
endeavors to reach the branches where the man lies concealed, and growl
spitefully. Their extreme heaviness, however, is thought by the Indians
to be all that prevents them from climbing.

A hunter once took refuge in a tree from one of these savage beasts, and
having vainly discharged all his ammunition at the monster, he
endeavored to hit it in the eye with cones, thinking to drive it away.
But the grizzly only became more infuriated, and began a brisk war-dance
around the tree, howling all the while in a terrible manner. At length
the branch upon which the hunter was sitting began to give way, and the
unfortunate man felt himself doomed to certain death. Closing his eyes,
he resigned himself to the worst, when, instead of falling, as he
expected, into the open jaws of the huge beast, he, together with the
heavy branch upon which he had been sitting, landed with a tremendous
thump upon the grizzly's head. The animal was so astonished and
frightened at this sudden and unexpected assault, that it took to its
heels, and soon disappeared in the forest. Such miraculous escapes,
however, are not frequent, and the number of Indians and hunters killed
by grizzlies is very large.

Young grizzlies have often been captured, and when very small are as
playful and affectionate as dogs. But they are not to be trusted, for as
they grow older, their savage nature develops, and they are liable to
become dangerous property. Unless they can be surprised away from the
mother, their capture is attended by the utmost peril. Nothing can
exceed the fury of the mother bear if her little ones are molested.
Rising on her hind-legs for a moment to survey the object of her hatred,
she will utter a hoarse "huff, huff, huff," and charge madly, and wary
and courageous must be the hunter who can overcome this savage monster.

Hunting the grizzly is usually accomplished by parties of men well
mounted, and with bands of trained dogs, but the huge beast will make a
desperate fight for its life, and often severely wounds numbers of its
assailants before being forced itself to succumb.




[Illustration: A MINIATURE YACHT REGATTA.--DRAWN BY F. S. COZZENS.--[SEE
NEXT PAGE.]]

MINIATURE YACHTS.


On the preceding page is an illustration of a miniature yacht regatta on
the Lake in Prospect Park, Brooklyn. In that beautiful Park there are
few sights to be seen as beautiful as this. The dainty yachts, perfect
in every detail, look like graceful white-winged birds skimming over the
water, and the announcement of a regatta on the Lake often attracts more
spectators than similar announcements of "grown-up" regattas down the
bay. Many of these spectators are very critical, and attend these
regattas in order to study fine points of sailing, and to learn what
models will show the greatest speed.

The little yachts are so carefully planned and built that they often
serve as models for those of many tons. Some of the finest yachts of the
New York, Brooklyn, Atlantic, and Seawanhaka Yacht Clubs are built from
models furnished by winners of races and regattas on the lakes of
Central and Prospect Parks.

Two regularly organized and officered clubs, the New York and Brooklyn
Miniature Yacht Clubs, are the rivals of these lakes, and many exciting
match races are sailed between the flyers of the two clubs. These races
and all the regattas are governed by the regular rules of yachting, time
allowances being made for differences of measurement, and the amount of
canvas allowed each boat, as well as the course to be sailed, being
accurately defined.

Of the miniature yachts, schooners of the first class are generally
about sixty inches long, are heavily sparred--that is, they have very
tall masts, long booms, and bow-sprit--and are ballasted with very deep
and heavy lead keels. They are either "built" or "cut"--that is, ribbed
and planked, or worked out from a single block of wood.

They carry rudders merely to make them look ship-shape, and are steered
entirely by their sails. These are so arranged as to balance fore and
aft, and the jib and main sheets are made of elastic rubber, so nicely
adjusted that if the boat is inclined to sail too close to the wind, the
main-sheet stretches, the mainsail is eased off, and she resumes her
proper course, with the wind free. If she is inclined to "fall off" too
much, and run before the wind, the jib-sheet stretches, the wind spills
out of the jib, and the pressure upon her aftersails quickly brings her
up on the wind again.

The fleet at Prospect Park this season numbers some fifty sail, from
sixty-inch schooners down to ten-inch cat-boats, and contains schooners,
sloops, cat-boats, catamarans, and one square-rigged steamer. An English
cutter will probably be added to the fleet very soon, and interesting
races between her and the boats of American model are expected.




EASY BOTANY.


JUNE.

June has many beautiful flowering trees, and many rare and remarkable
plants. Some of the anemones bloom in April and May, but several wait
for June. Among these the rare red anemone is found on rocky banks in
Western Vermont, in Northern New York, and Pennsylvania.

Among the pines and maples of Cape Ann, at Manchester, Massachusetts, we
find the laurel-magnolia, or sweet-bay, with silky leaves and buds, and
deliciously fragrant cream-white flowers. This charming shrub seems to
belong to the South, but has strangely strayed away, and made for itself
a cozy home on the "stern and rock-bound coast" of New England. This
magnolia also grows in Pennsylvania and Southern New York.

Belonging to the same fair family is the tulip-tree, with large
tulip-shaped flowers tinged with yellow, orange, and green. These trees
are found in rich soil in the Middle, Southern, and Western States.

Another wonderful plant of June is the large water-lily the _Nelumbo
luteum_, or water-chinquepin. This plant apparently belongs to the East
Indies, and seems to be nearly related to the pink lotus, or sacred bean
of India. The American species is rare, being found at but few places;
but Connecticut professes to possess it in the Connecticut River, near
Lyme; and it is found in the Delaware River, near Philadelphia, at
Woodstown and Swedesborough, New Jersey, and in several Western lakes.
The leaves are circular, from one to two feet in diameter, and raised
high above the water; the fragrant flowers are pale yellow; the seeds,
sunk deeply in a receptacle, are as large as acorns.

Our own beautiful white pond-lily is well known and well beloved; and
few New-Englanders are unfamiliar with the serene ponds and still waters
where the lily pods make a carpet on which rest the lovely heads of
these delicious favorites.

At Sandwich and Barnstable, Massachusetts, and Kennebunk, Maine, are
found lilies of a fine rose-color. The common cow-lily, as it is called,
though not a beauty like its relatives, is a pleasing variety, being of
a rich yellow color.

Next we come to the wonderful pitcher-plants, whose chosen homes are in
the black mud of peat-bogs and swamps.

The one with which we are most familiar is favored not only with a
botanical name of seven syllables, but has the common names of
side-saddle-flower, pitcher-plant, and hunter's-cup--all referring more
or less to the curious leaves, which are hollow, and shaped like little
pitchers, and are always found partly filled with water. The flower,
nodding on a tall stalk, is as singular as the leaves; it is of a deep
reddish-purple color, the petals arching over a little green umbrella in
the centre, which covers the stamens. This striking and interesting
plant may be easily found by any enterprising young botanist who is not
afraid of mud and water, as it grows from Maine to Illinois and
southward.

Another queer little dweller in bogs and swamps and wet meadows is the
sundew, one species of which may be found in June, and others later. The
leaves of this peculiar plant are covered with fine reddish-brown hairs,
or glands, which furnish small drops of fluid, glittering like
dew-drops.

Three species of wild oxalis, or wood-sorrel, should not be overlooked.
The _yellow_, which is found everywhere, is so common as to be
unappreciated; but the _white_, with petals streaked with red lines, is
very pretty: it is found in deep, cold woods in Massachusetts and the
Middle States. The _violet_ wood-sorrel is, however, the beauty of the
family, and rare enough to require being searched for. It springs from a
bulb in shady, rocky woods in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and New York;
three or four soft purple blossoms nod on a slender stalk, and it is a
lovely little plant. All the wood-sorrels are attractive and interesting
from the graceful and pathetic habit which they have of folding up and
drooping their delicate leaves at night-fall, opening them at the early
light of morning.

The showy wild lupine comes out with long racemes of purple, pink, blue,
and white blossoms, covering sandy fields with a flush of color.

The dear wild roses make the wood paths beautiful, and the indescribably
delicious fragrance of the sweet-brier betrays its location on the dry
banks and rocky road-sides.

The flowering raspberry, found in moist woods and shady dells, is as
beautiful as the rose, and the buds, if possible, more beautiful than
rose-buds. The flowers are large, of a vivid deep rose-red, and the
leaves maple-shaped, and very graceful.

In June, also, come six or eight species of _Cornus_, or dogwood, each
beautiful in its way. These shrubs, which are generally found in rich
soil in rocky, open woods, are rare in New England, but abundant in the
Middle States. The brilliant little bunchberry, however, which belongs
to the _Cornus_ family, delights in the deep cold woods of Maine, where
it grows luxuriantly, its rich red berries charming the eye in the
depths of the forest.

In the gloom of shady woods, at the roots of pine and oak trees, the
young botanist may perhaps be startled to see an array of little
_ghosts_, as it were, springing from dead leaves, and without one touch
of the green of summer, but waxen-white in every part, leaves, stems,
and all, sometimes having a faint shade of pink or tawny yellow. This is
the Indian-pipe, with none of the healthful honesty of other plants, but
stealing its existence from surrounding neighbors; and with this ghostly
parasite we will close the list for June, not that it is exhausted, for
hundreds stand waiting, but it would take a _book_ to tell of them all.

THE ADVENTURES OF A RAT RACE.

BY JAMES B. MARSHALL.


The carpenters came on a certain Monday morning to make some needed
alterations about Mr. Wilson's stable at the rear of his house yard. And
you know what a noise carpenters will make when working; far more than
enough to disturb the most contented of rats.

Peggy O'Conner, who was moving to and from the kitchen hanging up linen
to dry in the yard, said she saw no rat pass by her; but as a rat was
found in the library, it must have come there by way of the side yard
from the stable.

It was a rather warm summer morning, but with enough of a breeze blowing
to start Uncle Leonard sneezing if he should drop off to sleep while
sitting in a draught. Now, merry Uncle Leonard was asleep in an
easy-chair down in the library, where the two window-sashes were raised
and both doors were open. He had gone there, as usual, to read the
morning paper, but gradually it drooped nearer and nearer the end of his
nose, as usual, until it finally spread itself adroitly over his closed
eyes, to fend off the flies. Then he began to make that soft
steam-enginery sound that most stout gentlemen make when asleep, about
as loud as the purring of "Cattegat," Lou and Amy's cat.

Cattegat always followed Uncle Leonard to the library if possible, to
escape Lou and Amy, who, during their vacation, were trying to teach him
to hold a lump of sugar on the end of his nose while seated on his hind
paws. Cattegat, who liked the sugar but not the trick, had been so named
by a Danish gentleman who had presented him to Lou and Amy.

The rat as it entered the library thought, doubtless, that it was a
pretty comfortable-looking place, or else it wouldn't have gone about
the room smelling and sniffing until it found a piece of sponge-cake,
knocked by the canary from the wires of its cage.

That little breeze went on blowing across Uncle Leonard's head, and
directly he gave a rousing "ashoo!" of a sneeze. Such an
"a-a-sh-sh-shoo," that he actually sneezed himself into a sitting
position. The rat was more startled at such a noise than at all the
carpenters had made, and dropping the cake, peeped from behind an
ottoman where it took refuge.

Cattegat jumped up and looked at Uncle Leonard as if to ask him if he
had made that noise, and then glanced about the room.

"What can ail the cat!" exclaimed Uncle Leonard, as Cattegat went across
the floor in about three springs. Then quickly closing the yard door, he
called, "A rat! a rat!" as the rat ran from behind the ottoman.

Cattegat and the rat raced headlong around the room once, and Uncle
Leonard nearly kicked himself off his feet as the rat slipped unhurt by
him. Then away went the rat out of the library through the other door,
along the hall, and up the front stairs; away tore Cattegat not far
behind it; and quickly in pursuit trotted Uncle Leonard, calling, "Catch
him, Cattegat; catch him, Cattegat!"

At the moment, Lou, a very handy boy about the house, was in a
second-story room near the head of the stairs, and had just finished
gluing in the leg of Amy's rocking-chair. He had taken the chair there
to mend, because the floor was not carpeted, but smoothly varnished, and
any glue dropped could be easily removed. Amy stood watching him as she
slowly untied a package of prepared chalk for the teeth, with which she
had shortly before returned from the drug store.

"Gracious! what's coming up stairs?" said Lou, placing the glue brush on
the chair beside the glue-pot, and stepping to the door.

"Look out for the rat!" shouted Uncle Leonard.

Amy instantly sprang on the first object at hand, her just-mended
rocking-chair, which gave way, of course, and over she went. However,
she broke her fall by catching at the chair holding the glue-pot and
brush, though the glue rolled to the right and the brush to the left.
The package of prepared chalk, that had received an upward pitch as Amy
had toppled over, then came down in time to plentifully powder both her
and Lou.

The latter had turned to clear the way for the rat and Cattegat, not
more than an instant later than Amy had taken alarm, but the glue had
been spilled more quickly. And though Lou jumped over the pool of glue
safely, he landed right under the shower of chalk, and directly upon the
slippery glue brush. Presto! down went Lou, and shooting over the smooth
floor, vanished under the bed at the far end of the room, as though he
had been a clown playing in a pantomime.

Amy, so filled with laughter, could scarce manage to climb on the sound
chair before the rat and Cattegat came whizzing through the doorway;
both leaped clear of the spilled glue, and scampered in a flash across
the floor into the next room, and so on through several other rooms that
communicated.

"Oho! bravo, Cattegat!" said Uncle Leonard, as he came on, running at a
wonderful rate for him. Right through the doorway he ran, but on seeing
Amy, he was about to lessen his speed, and have her join in the chase,
when he stepped in the pool of glue. Slip, slip, slide across the room,
went Uncle Leonard, with his feet getting farther apart, as though the
floor was the slipperiest of ice. He slid to and against a wash-stand,
and then sank down slowly and gracefully at its foot in a way that would
have done credit to a champion gymnast. But he shook the stand so
violently that the water-pitcher was shaken over within its basin, and
emptied half its contents upon his head.

Amy rushed to his aid, righted the pitcher, and inquired if he was hurt.

"Not a bit," said Uncle Leonard, getting again on his feet, smiling
mirthfully at his own dripping coat, and giving one of those jolly
laughs of his at Amy's chalk-powdered head. "Come along, my dear,"
continued he; "keep the chase up, or the rat will yet have the best of
it. But where's Lou?"

"Here I am!" answered Lou, poking his laughing, powdered face from under
the bed, and crawling out. And away they all followed the chase, Uncle
Leonard kicking off his gluey slippers, and catching up a pair of Papa
Wilson's.

Cattegat and the rat in the mean time had been racing up and down the
front bedrooms, frightening Mamma Wilson and Aunt Laura into climbing up
on one of the beds, and Cattegat had distinguished himself by knocking
over a sewing basket and a screen. As the pursuers appeared upon the
scene, rat and cat ran out into the hallway again, through a door that
Aunt Laura had opened, hoping to get clear of them.

Then pat, pat, pat, again in chase went Lou and Amy's shoes; flap, flap,
flap, followed Uncle Leonard's slippers; and Mamma Wilson and Aunt Laura
brought up the rear with an irregular run and walk. Right through the
length of the whole second story, through the hallway, and from room to
room they rushed, with such a clatter and whoop as had never before been
heard in that house, merry as were its people.

Cattegat will now surely catch that ferocious rat in the last room,
thought every one. But no; straight down the back stairs plunged the
rat, and jump, jump, followed Cattegat, still several feet behind it.
And at the bottom of the stairway, closed by a door, the race would have
been doubtlessly won by Cattegat, but Peggy O'Conner, hearing such an
unusual commotion overhead, came to the door to inquire its cause. As
Peggy opened the door she heard several voices call: "Don't open that
door; Cattegat's after a rat."

Bang! went the door--closed quickly, I assure you; but something flew
past Peggy, and she only shut the door in Cattegat's face.

As that something, very much like a rat, flew past Peggy, and vanished
out of the kitchen, a piece of soap that Katie, the other girl, threw
with a very bad aim, went flying after it. But frightened Peggy, in
dismay, raised her hands, backed awkwardly against a tub of blue water
on the floor, and before she could recover her balance, splashed down
into the water, which flew about like the spray of a great fountain.

As the whole party filed down the back stairs, Katie was trying amidst
her merriment to help wringing-wet Peggy out of her queer bath, and all
but Cattegat had something to laugh at.

Cattegat seemed very much disappointed because the rat had escaped, and
went out in the yard, and hid himself under a rose-bush.

As for the rat, Lou is pretty certain that he sees it occasionally
capering about the stable, very much unlike a common rat that has never
had an adventure.

THE MORNING MESSAGE.

BY K. M. M.


  A beam was sent out by the morning sun
  To carry the message that day had begun.

  First the gay courier told his story
  To the opening buds of the morning-glory.

  The birds in their nest on the branch o'erhead
  Heard every word that the sunbeam said,

  And all at once in the trees was heard
  The twittered "good-morning" of each little bird.

  Then in at the window the messenger flew,
  And all around him his gold he threw.

  He scattered it here, and everywhere,
  He gilded the braids of the mother's hair.

  He glanced at the baby, who laughed with glee,
  And danced for joy on his mother's knee.

  And little Clara, the three-year-old,
  Tried to catch at the shining gold;

  And she said, "Mamma, if I'm good to-day,
  Perhaps this beautiful sunbeam will stay."

  BROOKLYN, NEW YORK.

     About a month ago my papa came home from Panama, and brought me
     two beautiful little birds for pets. I do not know any English
     name for them, but in Spanish they are called _Verdones del
     Pacifico_. They are about the size of a canary. Their bodies are
     beautiful dark blue, the wings and back are glossy black with a
     blue stripe, and the top of the head irised green. The under side
     of the wings is golden yellow. They have little bright black eyes,
     long bills like a humming-bird, and dainty little red legs and
     toes. They feed on bananas, and eat all day long. They are very
     queer little gymnasts, and hang head downward from their perch to
     reach their food. They do not sing, but the moment daylight begins
     they commence a sweet little peeping, which they keep up from
     morning till night.

     We did not know they would eat insects; but one afternoon a big
     fly came buzzing round their cage, and they fluttered and peeped
     and pushed their bills through the wires in their efforts to catch
     it. My brother caught it and gave it to them in his fingers. They
     both dived for it, and had a fight to see which should get the
     biggest half. Since then we catch flies for them all the time, and
     whenever any one goes near their cage they begin to peep and
     watch, hoping for a fly.

     Sometimes we shut the windows and let them fly around the room and
     hunt for themselves. They dart like lightning, and not a fly
     escapes them. They are growing very tame, and will come and perch
     upon my finger when they are tired flying.

     I wonder if any other little boy or girl has any _Verdones_? Their
     home is in the forests along the tropical Pacific coast. They
     build a nest similar to that of the humming-bird, and are
     considered members of the same family, although they do not hover
     over their food like the humming-bird.

  FORT ONTARIO, OSWEGO, NEW YORK.

     My father is a lieutenant in the Second Artillery. We have been in
     Oswego seventeen months. The fort is on the lake, and a very old
     fort it is. The scarf wall facing Lake Ontario has never been
     finished. In the fort grave-yard are some very old graves. There
     is one of George Fykes, a Revolutionary soldier, who died in 1776.

     This is a very pleasant post. In summer there is plenty of boating
     and fishing. I went fishing the other day, but did not have very
     good luck. There were a great many wrecks on the lake last fall.

     I have one little brother four months old. When he gets old enough
     I will write a letter for him too. I like YOUNG PEOPLE very much.
     I am ten years old.

     I like YOUNG PEOPLE ever so much. I have no pets except my little
     baby brother, but there are lots of birds' nests in our orchard.
     One day when we were in the orchard we saw a big nest with rags
     woven in it, and I spied a corner of an embroidered handkerchief
     that was given me a year ago last Christmas. Papa was up in the
     tree, and he pulled it out and threw it down to me. I think it was
     a blackbird's nest. The eggs were green, with dark brown spots on
     them.

     Here is a game that I invented. I have played it very often, and
     it is very good fun. Two boys stand opposite each other, about ten
     feet apart. Each boy has a ball--rubber ones are best, as they
     will bounce. The balls must be thrown from one boy to the other,
     both at the same time. When they hit in the air--which they do
     oftener than you would think--each boy tries to catch one on the
     first bounce or fly. Each ball so captured counts one. Whoever
     gets ten first beats.

     I have some tracing paper and a lithogram which papa gave me, and
     I have a great deal of fun tracing pictures and copying them on
     the lithogram.

     I thought you would like to hear about our kitty. At night when we
     go to bed he climbs over two sheds and a grape arbor up to mamma's
     window, and shakes the shutter until mamma gets up and lets him
     in. Then he goes down and waits at the front door till papa comes
     in. Then he follows papa down stairs, and papa gives him something
     to eat, and shuts him up in the kitchen. In the morning he runs
     out in the yard and plays around until breakfast-time, when he
     comes in and goes right to papa's place at the table. He puts his
     fore-paws upon the table, and claws papa's arm until he gets a
     piece of meat, or bread, which he likes best.

     Here is a recipe for Puss Hunter and her club. I call it
     jaw-breaker candy. It is a little different from Nellie H.'s
     recipe. One cup of brown sugar; half a cup of vinegar; a piece of
     butter the size of a hickory-nut. When I think it is boiled
     enough, I drop a little into a glass of cold water, and if it
     hardens, it is done, and I pour it into a buttered dish to cool.

     sent three of its legs flying, but I soon mended it.

     as large as ours, but it was very fine. I have a very nice
     collection of stamps and coins. My oldest coin, a Moorish one, is
     dated 1270. I have another dated 1275. Both the coins were given
     to me by Captain Boyton. Is it true that he was killed? I would

     I have copied all the recipes, and we have a nice cook that lets
     me try them, and helps me, too. She makes the crust for me, and I
     make the inside for an awful good lemon pie. Here is the recipe,
     and I wish Puss Hunter and the girls would try it and say what
     they think of it. Take one tea-cup of white sugar; one
     table-spoonful of butter; one egg; one large lemon; one tea-cup of
     boiling water; one table-spoonful of corn starch. Mix the butter
     and sugar in a bowl; then put the boiling water over the fire, and
     stir the corn starch (which you must first wet in a little cold
     water) into it till it thickens. Now pour it over the butter and
     sugar, and set it away to cool. When it is cold, add the juice and
     grated peel of the lemon (carefully removing the seeds) and the
     beaten egg. Bake it without any top crust. Three times all this
     makes two nice pies for big people, our cook says.

     YOUNG PEOPLE is--oh, too good for anything. When I grow older, I
     am going to take a dozen copies for poor little boys and girls
     whose papa and mamma can not take it for them, as mine do for me.

     Could you tell me the origin of the name "Forget-me-not" as

There are many graceful, poetic stories told by poets and romancers,

"Forget-me-not," but it is unlikely that any one of them has a
historical foundation. We leave the subject open for our youthful

of nature in a manner adapted to attract the attention of the child, and
at the same time to furnish him with accurate and important scientific
information. While the work is well suited as a class-book for schools,
its fresh and simple style cannot fail to render it a great favorite for
family reading.

The Three Parts of this book can be had in separate volumes by those who
desire it. This will be advisable when the book is to be used in
teaching quite young children, especially in schools.

[Illustration: ANSWERS TO WIGGLE No. 11, OUR ARTIST'S IDEA, AND NEW
WIGGLE No. 12.]

INSTRUCTIONS TO WIGGLE CONTRIBUTORS.


Write your name very distinctly on each Wiggle.

Be careful to follow the Wiggle accurately. The best way is to trace the
Wiggle on thin writing-paper.

Do not make your Wiggle too large.

Do not cross the line of the Wiggle in your design.

We can only print a certain number of Wiggles sent us, and many
excellent ones are not published for various reasons independent of
their merit. Contributors must not, therefore, feel disappointed, or
think we do not consider their Wiggles good, simply because they do not
happen to be published.

Send in your answers as early as possible.

The following list contains the names of those who sent in answers to
Wiggle No. 11 in time to have them published. New Wiggle No. 12 is an
easy one. Now let us see how many will catch the artist's idea.

Produced by Annie McGuire

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
