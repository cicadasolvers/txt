          AH, how oft we read or hear of
          Boys we almost stand in fear of!
          For example, take these stories
          Of two youths, named Max and Maurice,
          Who, instead of early turning
          Their young minds to useful learning,
          Often leered with horrid features
          At their lessons and their teachers.
          Look now at the empty head: he
          Is for mischief always ready.
          Teasing creatures, climbing fences,
          Stealing apples, pears, and quinces,
          Is, of course, a deal more pleasant,
          And far easier for the present,
          Than to sit in schools or churches,
          Fixed like roosters on their perches.
          But O dear, O dear, O deary,
          When the end comes sad and dreary!
          'Tis a dreadful thing to tell
          That on Max and Maurice fell!
          All they did this book rehearses,
          Both in pictures and in verses.




TRICK FIRST.


[Illustration]

          TO most people who have leisure
          Raising poultry gives great pleasure
          First, because the eggs they lay us
          For the care we take repay us;
          Secondly, that now and then
          We can dine on roasted hen;
          Thirdly, of the hen's and goose's
          Feathers men make various uses.
          Some folks like to rest their heads
          In the night on feather beds.
          One of these was Widow Tibbets,
          Whom the cut you see exhibits.

[Illustration]

          Hens were hers in number three,
          And a cock of majesty.
          Max and Maurice took a view;
          Fell to thinking what to do.
          One, two, three! as soon as said,
          They have sliced a loaf of bread,
          Cut each piece again in four,
          Each a finger thick, no more.
          These to two cross-threads they tie,
          Like a letter X they lie
          In the widow's yard, with care
          Stretched by those two rascals there.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

          Scarce the cock had seen the sight,
          When he up and crew with might:
          Cock-a-doodle-doodle-doo;--
          Tack, tack, tack, the trio flew.

[Illustration]

          Cock and hens, like fowls unfed,
          Gobbled each a piece of bread;

[Illustration]

          But they found, on taking thought,
          Each of them was badly caught.

[Illustration]

          Every way they pull and twitch,
          This strange cat's-cradle to unhitch;

[Illustration]

          Up into the air they fly,
          Jiminee, O Jimini!

[Illustration]

          On a tree behold them dangling,
          In the agony of strangling!
          And their necks grow long and longer,
          And their groans grow strong and stronger.

[Illustration]

          Each lays quickly one egg more,
          Then they cross to th' other shore.

[Illustration]

          Widow Tibbets in her chamber,
          By these death-cries waked from slumber,

[Illustration]

          Rushes out with bodeful thought:
          Heavens! what sight her vision caught!

[Illustration]

          From her eyes the tears are streaming:
          "Oh, my cares, my toil, my dreaming!
          Ah, life's fairest hope," says she,
          "Hangs upon that apple-tree."

[Illustration]

          Heart-sick (you may well suppose),
          For the carving-knife she goes;
          Cuts the bodies from the bough,
          Hanging cold and lifeless now
          And in silence, bathed in tears,
          Through her house-door disappears.

[Illustration]

          This was the bad boys' first trick,
          But the second follows quick.




TRICK SECOND.


          WHEN the worthy Widow Tibbets
          (Whom the cut below exhibits)
          Had recovered, on the morrow,
          From the dreadful shock of sorrow,
          She (as soon as grief would let her
          Think) began to think 'twere better
          Just to take the dead, the dear ones
          (Who in life were walking here once),
          And in a still noonday hour
          Them, well roasted, to devour.
          True, it did seem almost wicked,
          When they lay so bare and naked,
          Picked, and singed before the blaze,--
          They that once in happier days,
          In the yard or garden ground,
          All day long went scratching round.
          Ah! Frau Tibbets wept anew,
          And poor Spitz was with her, too.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

          Max and Maurice smelt the savor.
          "Climb the roof!" cried each young shaver.

[Illustration]

          Through the chimney now, with pleasure,
          They behold the tempting treasure,
          Headless, in the pan there, lying,
          Hissing, browning, steaming, frying.

[Illustration]

          At that moment down the cellar
          (Dreaming not what soon befell her)
          Widow Tibbets went for sour
          Krout, which she would oft devour
          With exceeding great desire
          (Warmed a little at the fire).
          Up there on the roof, meanwhile,
          They are doing things in style.
          Max already with forethought
          A long fishing-line has brought.

[Illustration]

          Schnupdiwup! there goes, O Jeminy!
          One hen dangling up the chimney.
          Schnupdiwup! a second bird!
          Schnupdiwup! up comes the third!
          Presto! number four they haul!
          Schnupdiwup! we have them all!--
          Spitz looks on, we must allow,
          But he barks: Row-wow! Row-wow!

[Illustration]

          But the rogues are down instanter
          From the roof, and off they canter.--
          Ha! I guess there'll be a humming;
          Here's the Widow Tibbets coming!
          Rooted stood she to the spot,
          When the pan her vision caught.

[Illustration]

          Gone was every blessed bird!
          "Horrid Spitz!" was her first word.

[Illustration]

          "O you Spitz, you monster, you!
          Let me beat him black and blue!"

[Illustration]

          And the heavy ladle, thwack!
          Comes down on poor Spitz's back!
          Loud he yells with agony,
          For he feels his conscience free.

[Illustration]

          Max and Maurice, dinner over,
          In a hedge, snored under cover;
          And of that great hen-feast now
          Each has but a leg to show

       *       *       *       *       *

          This was now the second trick,
          But the third will follow quick.




TRICK THIRD.


          THROUGH the town and country round
          Was one Mr. Buck renowned.

[Illustration]

          Sunday coats, and week-day sack-coats,
          Bob-tails, swallow-tails, and frock coats,
          Gaiters, breeches, hunting-jackets;
          Waistcoats, with commodious pockets,--
          And other things, too long to mention,
          Claimed Mr. Tailor Buck's attention.
          Or, if any thing wanted doing
          In the way of darning, sewing,
          Piecing, patching,--if a button
          Needed to be fixed or put on,--
          Any thing of any kind,
          Anywhere, before, behind,--
          Master Buck could do the same,
          For it was his life's great aim.
          Therefore all the population
          Held him high in estimation.
          Max and Maurice tried to invent
          Ways to plague this worthy gent.
          Right before the Sartor's dwelling
          Ran a swift stream, roaring, swelling.

[Illustration]

          This swift stream a bridge did span,
          And the road across it ran.

[Illustration]

          Max and Maurice (naught could awe them!)
          Took a saw, when no one saw them:
          Ritze-ratze! riddle-diddle!
          Sawed a gap across the middle.
          When this feat was finished well,
          Suddenly was heard a yell:

[Illustration]

          "Hallo, there! Come out, you buck!
          Tailor, Tailor, muck! muck! muck!"
          Buck could bear all sorts of jeering,
          Jibes and jokes in silence hearing;
          But this insult roused such anger,
          Nature couldn't stand it longer.

[Illustration]

          Wild with fury, up he started,
          With his yard-stick out he darted;
          For once more that frightful jeer,
          "Muck! muck! muck!" rang loud and clear.

[Illustration]

          On the bridge one leap he makes;
          Crash! beneath his weight it breaks.

[Illustration]

          Once more rings the cry, "Muck! muck!"
          _In_, headforemost, plumps poor Buck!
          While the scared boys were skedaddling,
          Down the brook two geese came paddling.

[Illustration]

          On the legs of these two geese,
          With a death-clutch, Buck did seize;

[Illustration]

          And, with both geese _well in hand_,
          Flutters out upon dry land.

[Illustration]

          For the rest he did not find
          Things exactly to his mind.

[Illustration]

          Soon it proved poor Buck had brought a
          Dreadful belly-ache from the water.

[Illustration]

          Noble Mrs. Buck! She rises
          Fully equal to the crisis;
          With a hot flat-iron, she
          Draws the cold out famously.

[Illustration]

          Soon 'twas in the mouths of men,
          All through town: "Buck's up again!"

       *       *       *       *       *

          This was the bad boys' third trick,
          But the fourth will follow quick.




TRICK FOURTH.


          AN old saw runs somewhat so:
          Man must learn while here below.--
          Not alone the A, B, C,
          Raises man in dignity;
          Not alone in reading, writing,
          Reason finds a work inviting;
          Not alone to solve the double
          Rule of Three shall man take trouble:
          But must hear with pleasure Sages
          Teach the wisdom of the ages.

[Illustration]

          Of this wisdom an example
          To the world was Master Laempel.
          For this cause, to Max and Maurice
          This man was the chief of horrors;
          For a boy who loves bad tricks
          Wisdom's friendship never seeks.
          With the clerical profession
          Smoking always was a passion;
          And this habit without question,
          While it helps promote digestion,
          Is a comfort no one can
          Well begrudge a good old man,
          When the day's vexations close,
          And he sits to seek repose.--
          Max and Maurice, flinty-hearted,
          On another trick have started;
          Thinking how they may attack a
          Poor old man through his tobacco.
          Once, when Sunday morning breaking,
          Pious hearts to gladness waking,
          Poured its light where, in the temple,
          At his organ sate Herr Laempel,

[Illustration]

          These bad boys, for mischief ready,
          Stole into the good man's study,
          Where his darling meerschaum stands.
          This, Max holds in both his hands;

[Illustration]

          While young Maurice (scapegrace born!)
          Climbs, and gets the powderhorn,
          And with speed the wicked soul
          Pours the powder in the bowl.
          Hush, and quick! now, right about!
          For already church is out.

[Illustration]

          Laempel closes the church-door,
          Glad to seek his home once more;

[Illustration]

          All his service well got through,
          Takes his keys, and music too,
          And his way, delighted, wends
          Homeward to his silent friends.
          Full of gratitude he there
          Lights his pipe, and takes his chair.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

          "Ah!" he says, "no joy is found
          Like contentment on earth's round!"

[Illustration]

          Fizz! whizz! bum! The pipe is burst,
          Almost shattered into dust.
          Coffee-pot and water-jug,
          Snuff-box, ink-stand, tumbler, mug,
          Table, stove, and easy-chair,
          All are flying through the air
          In a lightning-powder-flash,
          With a most tremendous crash.

[Illustration]

          When the smoke-cloud lifts and clears,
          Laempel on his back appears;
          God be praised! still breathing there,
          Only somewhat worse for wear.

[Illustration]

          Nose, hands, eyebrows (once like yours),
          Now are black as any Moor's;
          Burned the last thin spear of hair,
          And his pate is wholly bare.
          Who shall now the children guide,
          Lead their steps to wisdom's side?
          Who shall now for Master Laempel
          Lead the service in the temple?
          Now that his old pipe is out,
          Shattered, smashed, _gone up the spout_?

[Illustration]

          Time will heal the rest once more,
          But the pipe's best days are o'er.

       *       *       *       *       *

          This was the bad boys' fourth trick,
          But the fifth will follow quick.




TRICK FIFTH.


          IF, in village or in town,
          You've an uncle settled down,
          Always treat him courteously;
          Uncle will be pleased thereby.
          In the morning: "'Morning to you!
          Any errand I can do you?"
          Fetch whatever he may need,--
          Pipe to smoke, and news to read;
          Or should some confounded thing
          Prick his back, or bite, or sting,
          Nephew then will be near by,
          Ready to his help to fly;
          Or a pinch of snuff, maybe,
          Sets him sneezing violently:
          "Prosit! uncle! good health to you!
          God be praised! much good may't do you!"
          Or he comes home late, perchance:
          Pull his boots off then at once,
          Fetch his slippers and his cap,
          And warm gown his limbs to wrap.
          Be your constant care, good boy,
          What shall give your uncle joy.
          Max and Maurice (need I mention?)
          Had not any such intention.
          See now how they tried their wits--
          These bad boys--on Uncle Fritz.
          What kind of a bird a May-
          Bug was, _they_ knew, I dare say;

[Illustration]

          In the trees they may be found,
          Flying, crawling, wriggling round.

[Illustration]

          Max and Maurice, great pains taking,
          From a tree these bugs are shaking.

[Illustration]

          In their cornucopiae papers,
          They collect these pinching creepers.

[Illustration]

          Soon they are deposited
          In the foot of uncle's bed!

[Illustration]

          With his peaked nightcap on,
          Uncle Fritz to bed has gone;
          Tucks the clothes in, shuts his eyes,
          And in sweetest slumber lies.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

          Kritze! Kratze! come the Tartars
          Single file from their night quarters.

[Illustration]

          And the captain boldly goes
          Straight at Uncle Fritzy's nose.

[Illustration]

          "Baugh!" he cries: "what have we here?"
          Seizing that grim grenadier.

[Illustration]

          Uncle, wild with fright, upspringeth,
          And the bedclothes from him flingeth.

[Illustration]

          "Awtsch!" he seizes two more scape-
          Graces from his shin and nape.

[Illustration]

          Crawling, flying, to and fro,
          Round the buzzing rascals go.

[Illustration]

          Wild with fury, Uncle Fritz
          Stamps and slashes them to bits.

[Illustration]

          O be joyful! all gone by
          Is the May bug's deviltry.

[Illustration]

          Uncle Fritz his eyes can close
          Once again in sweet repose.

       *       *       *       *       *

          This was the bad boys' fifth trick,
          But the sixth will follow quick.




TRICK SIXTH.


          EASTER days have come again,
          When the pious baker men
          Bake all sorts of sugar things,
          Plum-cakes, ginger-cakes, and rings.
          Max and Maurice feel an ache
          In their sweet-tooth for some cake.

[Illustration]

          But the Baker thoughtfully
          Locks his shop, and takes the key.

          Who would steal, then, _this_ must do:
          Wriggle down the chimney-flue.

[Illustration]

          Ratsch! There come the boys, my Jiminy!
          Black as ravens, down the chimney.

[Illustration]

          Puff! into a chest they drop,
          Full of flour up to the top.

[Illustration]

          Out they crawl from under cover
          Just as white as chalk all over.

[Illustration]

          But the cracknels, precious treasure,
          On a shelf they spy with pleasure.

[Illustration]

          Knacks! The chair breaks! down they go--

[Illustration]

          Schwapp!--into a trough of dough!

[Illustration]

          All enveloped now in dough,
          See them, monuments of woe.

[Illustration]

          In the Baker comes, and snickers
          When he sees the sugar-lickers.

[Illustration]

          One, two, three! the brats, behold!
          Into two good _brots_ are rolled.

[Illustration]

          There's the oven, all red-hot,--
          Shove 'em in as quick as thought.

[Illustration]

          Ruff! out with 'em from the heat,
          They are brown and good to eat.

[Illustration]

          Now you think they've _paid the debt_!
          No, my friend, they're living yet.

[Illustration]

          Knusper! Knasper! like two mice
          Through their roofs they gnaw in a trice;

[Illustration]

          And the Baker cries, "You bet!
          There's the rascals living yet!"

       *       *       *       *       *

          This was the bad boys' sixth trick,
          But the last will follow quick.




LAST TRICK


          MAX and Maurice! I grow sick,
          When I think on your last trick.

[Illustration]

          Why must these two scalawags
          Cut those gashes in the bags?

[Illustration]

          See! the farmer on his back
          Carries corn off in a sack.

[Illustration]

          Scarce has he begun to travel,
          When the corn runs out like gravel.

[Illustration]

          All at once he stops and cries:
          "Darn it! I see where it lies!"

[Illustration]

          Ha! with what delighted eyes
          Max and Maurice he espies.

[Illustration]

          Rabs! he opens wide his sack,
          Shoves the rogues in--Hukepack!

[Illustration]

          It grows warm with Max and Maurice,
          For to mill the farmer hurries.

[Illustration]

          "Master Miller! Hallo, man!
          Grind me _that_ as quick as you can!"

[Illustration]

          "In with 'em!" Each wretched flopper
          Headlong goes into the hopper.

[Illustration]

          As the farmer turns his back, he
          Hears the mill go "creaky! cracky!"

[Illustration]

          Here you see the bits _post mortem_,
          Just as Fate was pleased to sort 'em.

[Illustration]

          Master Miller's ducks with speed
          Gobbled up the coarse-grained feed.

CONCLUSION.


          IN the village not a word,
          Not a sign, of grief, was heard.
          Widow Tibbets, speaking low,
          Said, "I thought it would be so!"
          "None but self," cried Buck, "to blame!
          Mischief is not life's true aim!"
          Then said gravely Teacher Laempel,
          "There again is an example!"
          "To be sure! bad thing for youth,"
          Said the Baker, "a sweet tooth!"
          Even Uncle says, "Good folks!
          See what comes of stupid jokes!"
          But the honest farmer: "Guy!
          What concern is that to I?"
          Through the place in short there went
          One wide murmur of content:
          "God be praised! the town is free
          From this great rascality!"

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
