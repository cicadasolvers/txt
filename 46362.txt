      EXPLANATION OF PLATE 1. Figs. 1-5 and 9-12. (II. p. 29.)

Fig. 1. Section through an unincubated blastoderm, shewing the upper layer,
composed of a single row of columnar cells, and the lower layer, composed
of several rows of rounded cells in which no nucleus is visible. Some of
the "formative cells," at the bottom of the segmentation cavity, are seen
at (_b_).

Fig. 2. Section through the periphery of an eight hours' blastoderm,
shewing the epiblast (_p_), the hypoblast (_h_), and the mesoblast
commencing to be formed (_c_), partly by lower-layer cells enclosed between
the epiblast and hypoblast, and partly by formative cells. Formative cells
at the bottom of the segmentation cavity are seen at _b_. At _s_ is one of
the side folds parallel to the primitive groove.

Fig. 3. Portion of the hypoblast of a thirteen hours' blastoderm, treated
with silver nitrate, shewing the great variation in the size of the cells
at this period. An hour-glass shaped nucleus is seen at _a_.

Fig. 4. Periphery of a twenty-three hours' blastoderm, shewing cell for
cell the junction between the hypoblast (_h_) and white-yolk spheres (_w_).

Fig. 5. Junction between the white-yolk spheres and the hypoblast cells at
the passage from the area pellucida to the area opaca. The specimen was
treated with silver nitrate to bring out the shape of the cells. The line
of junction between the opaque and pellucid areas passes diagonally.

Fig. 9. Section through the primitive streak of an eight hours' blastoderm.
The specimen shews the mesoblast very much thickened in the immediate
neighbourhood of the primitive streak, but hardly formed at all on each
side of the streak. It also shews the primitive groove just beginning to be
formed (_pr_), and the fusion between the epiblast and the mesoblast under
the primitive groove. The hypoblast is completely formed in the central
part of the blastoderm. At _f_ is seen one of the side folds parallel to
the primitive groove. Its depth has been increased by the action of the
chromic acid.

Fig. 10. Hypoblast cells from the hinder end of a thirty-six hours' embryo,
treated with silver nitrate, shewing the regularity and elongated shape of
the cells over the embryo and the smaller cells on each side.

Fig. 11. Epiblast cells from an unincubated blastoderm, treated with silver
nitrate, shewing the regular hexagonal shape of the cells and the small
spherules they contain.

Fig. 12. Portion of the epiblast of a thirty-six hours' embryo, treated
with silver nitrate, shewing the small rounded cells frequently found at
the meeting-points of several larger cells which are characteristic of the
upper layer.


     EXPLANATION OF PLATE 1. Figs. 6-8 and 13-19. (III. p. 41.)

Figs. 6 and 7 are sections through an embryo rather earlier than the one
drawn in fig. 8. Fig. 6 passes through the just commencing medullary groove
(_md_), which appears in fresh specimens, as in fig. 8, merely as an opaque
streak coming from the end of the primitive groove. The notochord is hardly
differentiated, but the _complete_ separation of mesoblast and hypoblast
under the primitive groove is clearly shewn. Fig. 7 passes through the
anterior end of the primitive groove (_pr_), and shews the fusion between
the mesoblast and epiblast, which is always to be found under the primitive
groove.

Fig. 8 is a view from above of a twenty hours' blastoderm, seen as a
transparent object. Primitive groove (_pr_). Medullary groove (_md_), which
passes off from the anterior end of the primitive groove, and is produced
by the thickening of the mesoblast. Head fold (_pf_).

Figs. 13-17 are sections through the blastoderm, drawn in fig. 18 through
the lines 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 respectively.

The first section (fig. 13) passes through the true medullary groove
(_mc_); the two medullary folds (_A_, _A_) are seen on each side with the
thickened mesoblast, and the mesoblast cells are beginning to form the
notochord (_nc_) under the medullary groove. There is no adherence between
the mesoblast cells and the epiblast under the medullary groove.

The second (fig. 14) section passes through the medullary groove where it
has become wider. Medullary folds, _A_, _A_; notochord, _ch_.

In the third section (fig. 15) the notochord (_ch_) is broader, and the
epiblast is raised in the centre, while the medullary folds are seen far
apart at _A_.

In section fig. 16 the medullary folds (_A_) are still to be seen enclosing
the anterior end of the primitive groove (_pr_). Where the primitive groove
appears there is a fusion of the epiblast and mesoblast, and no appearance
of the notochord.

In the last section, fig. 17, no trace is to be seen of the medullary
folds.

Figs. 18 and 19 are magnified views of two hardened blastoderms. Fig. 18 is
twenty-three hours old; fig. 19 twenty-five hours. They both shew how the
medullary canal arises entirely independently of the primitive groove and
in front of it, and also how the primitive groove gets pushed backwards by
the growth of the medullary groove. _pv_, Protovertebrae; other references
as above. Fig. 18 is the blastoderm from which sections figs. 13-17 were
cut.


               EXPLANATION OF PLATE 2. (IV. p. 47.)

Fig. 1 is taken from the anterior part of the pellucid area of a thirty
hours' chick, with four protovertebrae. At _n_ is a nucleus with two
nucleoli.

Figs. 2 and 3 are taken from the posterior end of the pellucid area of a
chick with eight protovertebrae. In fig. 3 the nuclei are seen to have
considerably increased in number at the points of starting of the
protoplasmic processes. At _n_ is seen a nucleus with two nucleoli.

Fig. 4 is taken from the anterior part of the pellucid area of an embryo of
thirty-six hours. It shews the narrow processes characteristic of the
anterior part of the pellucid area, and the fewer nuclei. Small spaces,
which have the appearance of vacuoles, are shewn at _v_.

Fig. 5 is taken from the posterior part of the pellucid area of a
thirty-six hours' embryo. It shews the nuclei, with somewhat irregular
nucleoli, which have begun to acquire the red colour of blood-corpuscles;
the protoplasmic processes containing the nuclei; the nuclei in the
protoplasm surrounding the corpuscles, as shewn at _a_, _a'_.

Fig. 6 shews fully formed blood-vessels, in part filled with
blood-corpuscles and in part empty. The walls of the capillaries, formed of
cells, spindle-shaped in section, are shewn, and also the secondary
investment of Klein at _k_, and at _b_ is seen a narrow protoplasmic
process filled with blood-corpuscles.

Fig. 7 is taken from the anterior part of the pellucid area of a thirty-six
hours' embryo. It shews a collection of nuclei which are beginning to
become blood-corpuscles.

Figs. 1-5 are drawn with an 1/8 object-glass. Fig. 6 is on a much smaller
scale. Fig. 7 is intermediate.

Fig. 8. A transverse section through the dorsal region of a forty-five
hours' embryo; _ao_, aorta with a few blood-corpuscles. v, Blood-vessels,
all of them being formed in the splanchnopleure, and all of them provided
with the secondary investment of Klein; _pe_, pellucid area; _op_, opaque
area.

Fig. 9. Small portion of a section through the opaque area of a
thirty-five hours' embryo, showing protoplasmic processes, with nuclei
passing from the somatopleure to the splanchnopleure.

Fig. 10. Section through the heart of a thirty-four hours' embryo. _a_.
Alimentary canal; _hb_, hind brain; _nc_, notochord; _e_, epiblast; _so_,
mesoblast of the somatopleure; _sp_, mesoblast of the splanchnopleure;
_hy_, hypoblast; _hz_, cavity of the heart.

Fig. 11. Section through the same embryo as fig. 10, and passing through
the orifice of the omphalomeseraic vein. _of_, Omphalomeseraic vein; other
references as above.

These two sections shew that the heart is entirely formed from the
mesoblast of the _splanchnopleure_, and that it is formed by the splitting
of that part of the mesoblast which has turned to assume its normal
direction after being folded in to form the muscular wall of the alimentary
canal. In fig. 11 the cavities so formed on each side have not yet united,
but in fig. 10 they have united. When the folding becomes more complete the
cavities (_of_, _of_) in fig. 11 will unite, and in this way the origin of
the omphalomeseraic veins will be carried further backwards. In the section
immediately behind section 11 the mesoblast had become thickened, but had
not split.

                               PLATE 3.

Fig. 1. Section parallel with the long axis of the embryo through a
blastoderm, in which the floor of the segmentation cavity (_sg_) is not yet
completely lined by cells. The roof of the segmentation cavity is broken.
(Magnified 60 diam.) The section is intended chiefly to illustrate the
distribution of nuclei (_n_) in the yolk under the blastoderm. One of the
chief points to be noticed in their distribution is the fact that they form
almost a complete layer under the floor of the segmentation cavity. This
probably indicates that the cells whose nuclei they become take some share
in forming the layer of cells which subsequently (vide fig. 4) forms the
floor of the cavity.

Fig. 2. Small portion of blastoderm and subjacent yolk of an embryo at the
time of the first appearance of the medullary groove. (Magnified 300 diam.)

The specimen is taken from a portion of the blastoderm which will form part
of the embryo. It shews two large nuclei of the yolk (_n_) and the network
in the yolk between them; this network is seen to be closer around the
nuclei than in the intervening space. The specimen further shews that there
are no areas representing cells around the nuclei.

Fig. 3. Section parallel with the long axis of the embryo through a
blastoderm, in which the floor of the segmentation cavity is not yet
covered by a complete layer of cells. (Magnified 60 diam.)

It illustrates (1) the characters of the epiblast, (2) the embryonic
swelling (_es_), (3) the segmentation cavity (_sg_). It should have been
drawn upon the same scale as fig. 4; the line above it represents its true
length upon this scale.

Fig. 4. Longitudinal section through a blastoderm at the time of the first
appearance of the embryonic rim, and before the formation of the medullary
groove. (Magnified 45 diam.)

It illustrates (1) the embryonic rim, (2) the continuity of epiblast and
hypoblast at edge of this, (3) the continual differentiation of the lower
layer cells, to form, on the one hand, the hypoblast, which is continuous
with the epiblast, and on the other the mesoblast, between this and the
epiblast; (4) the segmentation cavity, whose floor of cells is now
completed.

N.B. The cells at the embryonic end of the blastoderm have been made rather
too large.

Fig. 5. Surface view of the blastoderm shortly after the appearance of the
medullary groove. To shew the relation of the embryo to the blastoderm.

Fig. 6_a_ and _b_. Two transverse sections of the same embryo, shortly
after the appearance of the medullary groove. (Magnified 96 diam.)

_a._ In the region of the groove. It shews (1) the two masses of mesoblast
on each side, and the deficiency of the mesoblast underneath the medullary
groove; (2) the commencement of the closing in of the alimentary canal
below, chiefly from cells (_na_) derived from the yolk.

_b._ Section in the region of the head where the medullary groove is
deficient, other points as above.

Fig. 7_a_ and _b_. Two transverse sections of an embryo about the age or
rather younger than that represented in fig. 5. (Magnified 96 diam.)

_a._ Section nearer the tail; it shews the thickening of the hypoblast to
form the notochord (_ch'_).

In _b_ the thickening has become completely separated from the hypoblast as
the notochord. In _a_ the epiblast and hypoblast are continuous at the edge
of the section, owing to the section passing through the embryonic rim.

Fig. 8. Surface view of a spatula-shaped embryo. The figure shews (1) the
flattened head (_h_) where the medullary groove is deficient, (2) the
caudal lobes, with a groove between them; it also shews that at this point,
the medullary groove has become roofed over and converted into a canal.

Fig. 8_a_. Transverse section of fig. 8, passing through the line _a_.
(Magnified 90 diam.) The section shews (1) the absence of the medullary
groove in the head and the medullary folds turning down at this time
instead of upwards; (2) the presence of the pleuro-peritoneal cavity in the
head (_pp_); (3) the completely closed alimentary canal (_al_).

Fig. 8_b_. Transverse section of fig. 8, through the line _b_. (Magnified
90 diam.) It shews (1) the neural canal completely formed; (2) the
vertebral plates of mesoblast not yet split up into somatopleure and
splanchnopleure.

Fig. 9. Side view of an embryo of the Torpedo, seen as a transparent object
a little older than the embryo represented in fig. 8. (Magnified 20 diam.)
The internal anatomy has hardly altered, with the exception of the
medullary folds having closed over above the head and the whole embryo
having become more folded off from the germ.

The two caudal lobes, and the very marked groove between them, are seen at
_ts_. The front end of the notochord became indistinct, and I could not see
its exact termination. The epithelium of the alimentary canal (_al_) is
seen closely underlying the notochord and becoming continuous with the
epiblast at the hind end of the notochord.

The first visceral cleft (1_vc_) and eye (_op_) are just commencing to be
formed, and the cranial flexure has just appeared.

Fig. 10. Section through the dorsal region of an embryo somewhat older than
the one represented in fig. 9. (Magnified 96 diam.)

It shews (1) the formation by a pinching off from the top of the alimentary
canal of a peculiar body which underlies the notochord (_x_); (2) the
primitive extension of the pleuro-peritoneal cavity up to the top of the
vertebral plates.


                               PLATE 4.

Fig. 11_a_, _b_, and _c_. Three sections closely following each other from
an embryo in which three visceral clefts are present; _a_ is the most
anterior of the three. (Magnified 96 diam.) In all of these the
muscle-plates are shewn at _mp_. They have become separated from the
lateral plates in _b_ and _c_, but are still continuous with them in _a_.
The early formed mass of muscles is also shewn in all the figures (_mp'_).

The figures further shew (1) the formation of the spinal nerves (_spn_) as
small bodies of cells closely applied to the upper and outer edge of the
neural canal.

(2) The commencing formation of the cells which form the axial skeleton
from the inner (splanchnopleuric) layer of the muscle-plate. Sections _b_
and _c_ are given more especially to shew the mode of formation of the
oviduct (_ov_).

In _b_ it is seen as a _solid knob (ov)_, arising from the point where the
somatopleure and splanchnopleure unite, and in _c_ (the section behind _b_)
as a _solid rod (ov)_ closely applied to the epiblast, which has grown
backwards from the knob seen in _b_.

N.B. In all three sections only one side is completed.

Fig. 12_a_ and _b_. Two transverse sections of an embryo just before the
appearance of the external gills. (Magnified 96 diam.)

In _a_ there is seen to be an involution on each side (_pwd_), while _b_ is
a section from the space between two involutions from the pleuro-peritoneal
cavity, so that the Wolffian duct (at first solid) (_wd_) is not connected
as in _a_ with the pleuro-peritoneal cavity. The further points shewn in

to illustrate the formation of the mesoblast as two independent lateral
masses of cells; only half of each section is represented. 8_a_ is the most
posterior of the three sections. In it the mesoblast forms a large mass on
each side, imperfectly separated from the hypoblast. In 8_b_, from the
anterior part of the embryo, the main mass of mesoblast is far smaller, and
only forms a cap to the hypoblast at the highest point of the medullary
fold. In 8_c_ a cap of mesoblast is present, similar to that in 8_b_,
though much smaller. The sections of these embryos were somewhat oblique,
and it has unfortunately happened that while in 8_a_ one side is
represented, in 8_b_ and 8_c_ the other side is figured, had it not been
for this the sections 8_b_ and 8_c_ would have been considerably longer
than 8_a_.

                               PLATE 9.

Fig. 1. Yolk of a Pristiurus egg with blastoderm and embryo. About
two-thirds of the yolk have been enveloped by the blastoderm. The embryo is
still situated at the edge of the blastoderm, but at the end of a bay in
the outline of this. The thickened edge of the blastoderm is indicated by a
darker shading. Two arteries have appeared.

Fig. 2. Yolk of an older Pristiurus egg. The yolk has become all but
enveloped by the blastoderm, and the embryo ceases to lie at the edge of
the blastoderm, owing to the coalescence of the two sides of the bay which
existed in the earlier stage. The circulation is now largely developed. It
consists of an external arterial ring, and an internal venous ring, the
latter having been developed in the thickened edge of the blastoderm.
Outside the arterial ring no vessels are developed.

Fig. 3. The yolk has now become completely enveloped by the blastoderm. The
arterial ring has increased in size. The venous ring has vanished, owing to
the complete enclosure of the yolk by the blastoderm. The point where it
existed is still indicated (_y_) by the brush-like termination of the main
venous trunk in a number of small branches.

Fig. 4. Diagrammatic projection of the vascular system of the yolk sac of a
somewhat older embryo.

The arterial ring has grown much larger and the portion of the yolk where
no vessels exist is very small (_x_). The brush-like termination of the
venous trunk is still to be noticed.

The two main trunks (arterial and venous) in reality are in close contact
as in fig. 5, and enter the somatic stalk close together.

The letter _a_ which points to the venous (blue) trunk should be _v_ and
not _a_.

Fig. 5. Circulation of the yolk sac of a still older embryo, in which the
arterial circle has ceased to exist, owing to the space outside it having
become smaller and smaller and finally vanished.

Fig. 1. Head of a Pristiurus embryo of stage K viewed as a transparent
object.

The points which deserve special attention are: (1) The sections of the
body-cavity in the head (_pp_): the first or premandibular section being
situated close to the eye, the second in the mandibular arch. Above this
one the fifth nerve bifurcates. The third at the summit of the hyoid arch.

The cranial nerves and the general appearance of the brain are well shewn
in the figure.

The notochord cannot be traced in the living embryo so far forward as it is
represented. It has been inserted according to the position which it is
seen to occupy in sections.

Fig. 2. Head of an embryo of Scyllium canicula somewhat later than stage K,
viewed as a transparent object.

The figure shews the condition of the brain; the branches of the fifth and
seventh nerves (v. vii.); the rudiments of the semicircular canals; and the
commencing appearance of the external gills as buds on both walls of 2nd,
3rd, and 4th clefts. The external gills have not appeared on the first
cleft or spiracle.

3 visceral clefts. Zeiss A, ocul. 1.

5_a_ shews the formation of the thin roof of the fourth ventricle by a
divarication of the two lateral halves of the brain.

Both sections shew the commencing formation of the thyroid body (_th_) at
the base of the mandibular arch.

They also illustrate the formation of the visceral clefts by an outgrowth
from the alimentary tract without any corresponding ingrowth of the
external epiblast.

Fig. 6. Section through the hind-brain of a somewhat older Torpedo embryo.
Zeiss A, ocul. 1.

belonging to a stage intermediate between I and K, passing through both the
fore-brain and the hind-brain. Zeiss A, ocul. 1.

The section illustrates (1) the formation of the pituitary body (_pt_) from
the mouth involution (_m_), and proves that, although the wall of the
throat (_al_) is in contact with the mouth involution, there is by this
stage no communication between the two. (2) The eye. (3) The sections of
the body-cavity in the head (1_pp_, 2_pp_). (4) The fifth nerve (v.) and
the seventh nerve (vii).

body-cavity in the head (1_pp_).

Figs. 9_a_ and 9_b_. Two longitudinal sections through the brain of a
Pristiurus embryo belonging to a stage intermediate between I and K. Zeiss
A, ocul. 1.

9_a_ is taken through the median line, but is reconstructed from two
sections. It shews (1) The divisions of the brain--The cerebrum and
thalamencephalon in the fore-brain; the mid-brain; the commencing
cerebellum in the hind-brain. (2) The relation of the mouth involution to
the infundibulum. (3) The termination of the notochord.

9_b_ is a section to one side of the same brain. It shews (1) The divisions
of the brain. (2) The point of outgrowth of the optic nerves (_opn_). (3)

the mouth involution to the infundibulum.

Fig. 13_a_. Longitudinal and horizontal section through part of the head of
a Pristiurus embryo rather older than K. Zeiss A, ocul. 1.

The figure contains the eye cut through in the plane of the choroid slit.
Thus the optic nerve (_opn_) and choroid slit (_ch_) are both exhibited.
Through the latter is seen passing mesoblast accompanied by a blood-vessel
(_v_). _Op_ represents part of the optic vesicle to one side of the choroid
slit.

No mesoblast can be seen passing round the outside of the optic cup; and
the only mesoblast which enters the optic cup passes through the choroid
slit.

Fig. 13_b_. Transverse section through the last arch but one of the same
embryo as 13_a_. Zeiss A, ocul. 1.

One side has been injured.

Figs. 15_a_ and 15_b_. Two longitudinal and vertical sections through the
head of a Pristiurus embryo belonging to stage K. Zeiss a, ocul. 3.

15_a_ is the most superficial section of the two. It shews the constitution
of the seventh and fifth nerves, and of the intestinal branch of the vagus.
The anterior branch of the seventh nerve deserves a special notice.

15_b_ mainly illustrates the dorsal commissure of the vagus nerve (_com_)
continuous with the dorsal commissures of the posterior root of the spinal
nerves.

Fig. 16. Two longitudinal and vertical sections of the head of a Pristiurus
embryo belonging to the end of stage K. Zeiss a, ocul. 1.

16_a_ passes through the median line of the brain and shews the
infundibulum, notochord and pituitary body, etc.

The pituitary body still opens into the mouth, though the septum between
the mouth and the throat is broken through.

Fig. 1. Diagram of cranial nerves at stage L.

A description of the part of this referring to the vagus and
glossopharyngeal nerves is given at p. 426. It should be noticed that there
are only five strands indicated as springing from the spinal cord to form
the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves. It is however probable that there
are even from the first a greater number of strands than this.

There appears to be one root in the brain for the glossopharyngeal, and at
least six for the vagus. The fibres from the roots divide in many cases
into two bundles before leaving the brain. Swellings of the brain towards
the interior of the fourth ventricle are in connection with the first five
roots of the vagus, and the glossopharyngeal root; and a swelling is also
intercalated between the first vagus root and the glossopharyngeal root.

1_a_ shews the cloacal involution at its deepest part abutting on the
cloacal section of the alimentary tract.

1_b_ is a section through a point somewhat behind this close to the opening
of the Wolffian ducts into the cloaca.

1_c_ shews the opening to the exterior in the posterior part of the cloaca,
and also the rudiments of the two abdominal pockets (_abp_).

Fig. 5. Portion of liver network of stage L. Zeiss C, ocul. 2. The section
is intended to illustrate the fact that the tubules or cylinders of which
the liver is composed are hollow and not solid. Between the liver tubules
are seen blood spaces with distinct walls, and blood corpuscles in their
interior.

male Scyllium canicula, natural size.

Fig. 2. Diagrammatic representation of the kidney proper on one side of a
female Scyllium canicula, natural size, shewing the ducts of the kidney and
the dilated portion of the Wolffian duct.

Fig. 3. Opening of the ureters into the Wolffian duct of a female Scyllium
canicula. The figure represents the Wolffian ducts (_wd_) with ventral
portion removed so as to expose their inner surface, and shews the junction
of the two W. ducts to form the common urinal cloaca, the single external
opening of this (_o_), and openings of ureters into one Wolffian duct
(_ou_).

Fig. 4. Anterior extremity of Wolffian body of a young male Scyllium
canicula shewing the vasa efferentia and their connection with the kidneys
and the testis. The vasa efferentia and longitudinal canal are coloured to
render them distinct. They are intended to be continuous with the
uncoloured coils of the Wolffian body, though this connection has not been
very successfully rendered by the artist.

Fig. 5. Part of the Wolffian body of a nearly ripe male embryo of Scyllium
canicula as a transparent object. Zeiss a a, ocul. 3. The figure shews two
segmental tubes opening into the body-cavity and connected with a primary
Malpighian body, and also, by a fibrous connection, with a secondary
Malpighian body of the preceding segment. It also shews one segmental tube
(_rst_) imperfectly connected with the accessory Malpighian body of the
preceding segment of the kidney. The coils of the kidney are represented
somewhat diagrammatically.

Fig. 6. Vasa efferentia of a male embryo of Scyllium canicula eight
centimetres in length. Zeiss a a, ocul. 2.

There are seen to be at the least six and possibly seven distinct vasa
going to as many segments of the Wolffian body and connected with a
longitudinal canal in the base of the testis. They were probably also
connected with a longitudinal canal in the Wolffian body, but this could
not be clearly made out.

Fig. 7. The anterior four vasa efferentia of a nearly ripe embryo.
Connected with the foremost one is seen a body which looks like the remnant
of a segmental tube and its opening (_rst?_).

Fig. 8. Testis and anterior part of Wolffian body of an embryo of Squatina
vulgaris.

The figure is intended to illustrate the arrangement of the vasa
efferentia. There are five of these connected with a longitudinal canal in
the base of the testis, and with another longitudinal canal in the Wolffian
body. From the second longitudinal canal there pass off four ducts to as
many Malpighian bodies. Through the Malpighian bodies these ducts are
continuous with the several coils of the Wolffian body, and so eventually
with the Wolffian duct. Close to the hindermost vas efferens is seen a body
which resembles a rudimentary segmental tube (_rst?_).


                             PLATE 21.

Figs. 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D. Four sections from a female Scyllium canicula of a
stage between M and N through the part where the segmental duct becomes
split into Wolffian duct and oviduct. Zeiss B, ocul. 2. 1A is the foremost
section.

The sections shew that the oviduct arises as a thickening on the under
surface of the segmental duct into which at the utmost a very narrow
prolongation of the lumen of the segmental duct is carried. The small size
of the lumen of the Wolffian duct in the foremost section is due to the
section passing through nearly its anterior blind extremity.

Fig. 2. Section close to the junction of the Wolffian duct and oviduct in a
female embryo of Scyllium canicula belonging to stage N. Zeiss B, ocul. 2.

The section represented shews that in some instances the formation of the
oviduct and Wolffian duct is accompanied by a division of the lumen of the
segmental duct into two not very unequal parts.

Figs. 3A, 3B, 3C. Three sections illustrating the formation of a ureter in
a female embryo belonging to stage N. Zeiss B, ocul. 2.

3A is the foremost section.

The figures shew that the lumen of the developing ureter is enclosed in
front by an independent wall (fig. 3A), but that further back the lumen is
partly shut in by the subjacent Wolffian duct, while behind no lumen is
present, but the ureter ends as a solid knob of cells without an opening
into the Wolffian duct.

Fig. 4. Section through the ureters of the same embryo as fig. 3, but
nearer the cloaca. Zeiss B, ocul. 2.

The figure shews the appearance of a transverse section through the wall of
cells above the Wolffian duct formed by the overlapping ureters, the lumens
of which appear as perforations in it. It should be compared with fig. 9A,
which represents a longitudinal section through a similar wall of cells.

Fig. 5. Section through the ureters, the Wolffian duct and the oviduct of a
female embryo of Scy. canicula belonging to stage P. Zeiss B, ocul. 2.

Fig. 6. Section of part of the Wolffian body of a male embryo of Scyllium
canicula belonging to stage O. Zeiss B, ocul. 2.

The section illustrates (1) the formation of a Malpighian body (_mg_) from
the dilatation at the end of a segmental tube, (2) the appearance of the
rudiment of the Muellerian duct in the male (_od'_).

Figs. 7_a_, 7_b_. Two longitudinal and vertical sections through part of
the kidney of an embryo between stages L and M. Zeiss B, ocul. 2.

7_a_ illustrates the parts of a single segment of the Wolffian body at this
stage, vide p. 491. The segmental tube and opening are not in the plane of
the section, but the dilated vesicle is shewn into which the segmental tube
opens.

7_b_ is taken from the region of the kidney proper. To the right is seen
the opening of a segmental tube into the body-cavity, and in the segment to
the left the commencing formation of a ureter, vide p. 502.

Fig. 8. Longitudinal and vertical section through the posterior part of the
kidney proper of an embryo of Scyllium canicula at a stage between N and O.
Zeiss A, ocul. 2.

The section shews the nearly completed ureters, developing Malpighian
bodies, &c.

Fig. 9. Longitudinal and vertical section through the anterior part of the
kidney proper of the same embryo as fig. 8. Zeiss A, ocul. 2.

The figure illustrates the mode of growth of the developing ureters.

9A. More highly magnified portion of the same section as fig. 9.

Compare with transverse section fig. 4.

Fig. 10. Longitudinal and vertical section through part of the Wolffian
body of an embryo of Scyllium canicula at a stage between O and P.

The section contains two examples of the budding out of the vesicle of a
segmental tube to form a Malpighian body in its own segment and to unite
with the tubulus of the preceding segment close to its opening into the
Wolffian duct.

  Footnote 3: The figures on these Plates give a fair general
  idea of the appearance presented by the developing spinal
  nerves; but the finer details of the original drawings have in
  several cases become lost in the process of copying.

  The figures which are tinted represent sections of embryos
  hardened in osmic acid; those without colour sections of
  embryos hardened in chromic acid.


                             PLATE 22.

Fig. A. Section through the dorsal region of an embryo of _Scyllium
stellare_, with the rudiments of two visceral clefts. The section
illustrates the general features at a period anterior to the appearance
of the posterior nerve-roots.

_nc._ neural canal. _mp._ muscle-plate. _ch._ notochord. _x._
subnotochordal rod. _ao._ rudiment of dorsal aorta. _so._ somatopleure.

Figs. B I, B II, B III. Three sections of a _Pristiurus_-embryo. B I is
through the heart, B II through the anterior part of the dorsal region,
and B III through a point slightly behind this. Drawn with a camera.
(Zeiss CC, ocul. 2.)

In B III there is visible a slight proliferation of cells from the
dorsal summit of the neural canal.

In B II this proliferation definitely constitutes two club-shaped masses
of cells (_pr_), both attached to the dorsal summit of the neural canal.
The masses are the rudiments of the posterior nerve-roots.

In B I the rudiments of the posterior roots are of considerable length.

_pr._ rudiment of posterior roots. _nc._ neural canal. _mp._
muscle-plate. _ch._ notochord. _x._ subnotochordal rod. _ao._ dorsal

was slightly distorted in the process of removal from the blastoderm.

_vr._ rudiment of vertebral body. Other reference letters as in previous
figures.

Fig. D a. Section through the dorsal region of a _Torpedo_-embryo with
three visceral clefts. (Zeiss CC, ocul. 2.) The section shews the
formation of the dorsal nerve-rudiments (_pr_) and of a ventral anterior
nerve-rudiment (_ar_), which at this early stage is not distinctly
cellular.

_ar._ rudiment of an anterior nerve-root. _y._ cells left behind on the
separation of the external skin from the spinal cord. _c._
connective-tissue cells springing from the summit of the muscle-plates.
Other reference letters as above.

Fig. D b. Section from dorsal region of a _Torpedo_-embryo somewhat
older than D a. Camera. (Zeiss CC, ocul. 2.) The posterior
nerve-rudiment is considerably longer than in fig. D a, and its pedicle
of attachment to the spinal cord is thinner. The anterior
nerve-rudiment, of which only the edge is present in the section, is
distinctly cellular.

_m._ mesoblast growing up from vertebral rudiment. _sd._ segmental duct.

Fig. D c. Section from a still older _Torpedo_-embryo. Camera. (Zeiss
CC, ocul. 2.) The connective-tissue cells are omitted. The rudiment of
the ganglion (_g_) on the posterior root has appeared. The rudiment of
the posterior nerve is much longer than before, and its junction with
the spinal cord is difficult to detect. The anterior root is now an
elongated cellular structure.

_g._ ganglion.

Fig. D d. Longitudinal and vertical section through a _Torpedo_-embryo
of the same age as D c.

The section shews the commissures (_x_) uniting the posterior roots.

Fig. E a. Section of a _Pristiurus_-embryo belonging to the second
stage. Camera. (Zeiss CC, ocul. 2.) The section shews the constriction
of the pedicle which attaches the posterior nerve-rudiments to the

Fig. E b. Section of a _Pristiurus_-embryo slightly older than E a.
Camera. (Zeiss CC, ocul. 2.) The section shews the formation of the
anterior nerve-root (_ar_).

_ar._ rudiment of the anterior nerve-root.

Fig. F. Section of a _Pristiurus_-embryo with the rudiments of five
visceral clefts. Camera. (Zeiss CC, ocul. 2.)

The rudiment of the posterior root is seen surrounded by
connective-tissue, from which it cannot easily be distinguished. The
artist has not been very successful in rendering this figure.

Figs. G 1, G 2, G 3. Three longitudinal and horizontal sections of an
embryo somewhat older than F. The embryo from which these sections were
taken was hardened 035.png in osmic acid, but the sections have been
represented without tinting. G I is most dorsal of the three sections.
Camera. (Zeiss CC, ocul. 1.)

_nc._ neural canal. _sp.c._ spinal cord. _pr._ rudiment of posterior
root. _ar._ rudiment of anterior root. _mp._ muscle-plate. _c._

                             PLATE 23.

Fig. H I. Section through the dorsal region of a _Pristiurus_-embryo in
which the rudimentary external gills are present as very small knobs.
Camera. (Zeiss CC, ocul. 2.)

The section shews the commencing differentiation of the posterior
nerve-rudiment into root (_pr_), ganglion (_sp.g_), and nerve (_n_), and
also the attachment of the nerve-root to the spinal cord (_x_). The
variations in the size and shape of the cells in the different parts of
the nerve-rudiment are completely lost in the figure.

_pr._ posterior nerve-root. _sp.g._ ganglion of posterior root. _n._
nerve of posterior root. _x._ attachment of posterior root to spinal
cord. _w._ white matter of spinal cord. _i._ mesoblastic investment to
the spinal cord.

Fig. H II. Section through the same embryo as H I. (Zeiss CC, ocul. 1.)

The section contains an anterior root, which takes its origin at a point
opposite the interval between two posterior roots.

The white matter has not been very satisfactorily represented by the
artist.

Figs. I I, I II. Two sections of a _Pristiurus_-embryo somewhat older
than H. Camera. (Zeiss CC, ocul. 1.)

The connective-tissue cells are omitted.

Figs. I a, I b, I c. Three isolated cells from the ganglion of one of
the posterior roots of the same embryo.

Figs. K I, K II. Two horizontal longitudinal sections through an embryo
in which the external gills have just appeared. K I is the most dorsal
of the two sections. Camera. (Zeiss CC, ocul. 1.)

The sections shew the relative positions of the anterior and posterior
roots at different levels.

_pr._ posterior nerve-rudiment. _ar._ anterior nerve-rudiment. _sp.c._
spinal cord. _n.c._ neural canal. _mp._ muscle-plate. _mp'._
first-formed muscles.

Fig. L. Longitudinal and vertical section through the trunk of a
_Scyllium_-embryo after the external gills have attained their full
development. Camera. (Zeiss CC, ocul. 1.)

The embryo was hardened in a mixture of chromic acid and osmic acid.

The section shews the commissures which dorsally unite the posterior
roots, and also the junction of the anterior and posterior roots. The
commissures are unfortunately not represented in the figure with great
accuracy; their outlines are in nature perfectly regular, and not, as in
the figure, notched at the junctions of the cells composing them. Their
cells are apparently more or less completely fused, and certainly not
nearly so clearly marked as in the figure. The commissures stain very
deeply with the mixture of osmic and chromic acid, and form one of the
most conspicuous features in successful longitudinal sections of embryos
so hardened. In sections hardened with chromic acid only they cannot be
seen with the same facility. 036.png

_sp. c._ spinal cord. _gr._ grey matter. _w._ white matter. _ar._
anterior root. _pr._ posterior root. _x._ commissure uniting the
posterior roots.

horizontal section through the head. The figure is so far diagrammatic that
the lens is represented as filling up the whole space between the rods and
the cornea. In the actual section there is a considerable space between the
parts, but this space is probably artificial, being in part caused by the
shrinkage of the lens and in part by the action of the razor. (Zeiss C,

                          TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES:

Underscores surround text in italics, _like this_. Raised dots in
numbers were converted to decimals. Superscript letters are enclosed in
braces, e.g. P{1}.

Use of periods and commas in the abbreviations within and referring to
illustrations is inconsistent. Often punctuation marks do not match the
illustrations to which they refer. Periods were retained; commas
were added to separate figure numbers from abbreviations within the figure.
Spacing within the abbreviations was standardized. Occasionally,
identification marks referenced in the text do not match the illustration
(for example, discussion of Figure 10, Plate 2, where epiblast is identified
with _e_ in the text, but with E in the illustration).

Footnotes were renumbered sequentially, indented, and moved to follow the
paragraph or section in which the anchor occurs.

Other changes:

and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
