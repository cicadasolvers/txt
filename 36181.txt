INTRODUCTION


Historians may trace in the Royal charters issued to the Virginia
Company of London a course of empire; a Company organized for profit by
the ablest businessmen of their time--merchants, manufacturers,
statesmen, and artists who bound themselves together in a joint stock
enterprise. The historian may also find in the three charters here
published a pattern for a parliamentary system and its development into
the American form of government. He might even perceive the inception of
a new society.

The origin of the joint stock company was probably primitive. Its later
genesis may readily be seen in the medieval guild. It became an English
institution in its application by Sir Walter Raleigh to his magnificent
adventures in both honest trade and romantic piracy.

The Company provided an agency for assembling adventure capital and
supplying able management to enterprises of great moment. It offered an
invitation to the industrious to participate in the growing wealth and
expanding power of the great English middle class. It supplied an
opportunity to small investors and it limited their liability. It was an
adaptation by practical people to practical problems.

Subscribers, or shareholders, met in their quarterly courts to discuss
the business of the Company and participate in its management. These
courts were the counterpart of our present day corporate stockholders'
meetings and were characterized by the same sort of discussions. King
James could protest vehemently against the "democratical principles of
the Company." He could see in their charters the final death warrant of
feudalism. He could execute Raleigh "chiefly for giving satisfaction to
the King of Spain." He could revoke the charters in 1624, but he could
not stop the rising tide of representative institutions nor darken the
great vision of the liberal Elizabethans. A new day had dawned.

The General Assembly which met at Jamestown in 1619 was the natural
child of the Company. Some of the planters along the James River were
shareholders in the Company. They had a voice in its management. In the
management of the civil affairs of the Colony it was, therefore, logical
that the plantations should elect their representatives to the local
governing body. It was thus that the first freely elected parliament of
a self-governing people in the Western World came into existence. Its
principles were based on those of the corporation chartered and
organized for profit by businessmen.

The three charters here published, changed successively to meet changing
conditions, were the rules and the by-laws for the commercial, economic,
and political development of a homogeneous, industrious English society
in a land of opportunity. The principal authors and executors of the
charters, Sir Thomas Smith and Sir Edwin and George Sandys, were
businessmen. They were practical men. They found a practical way to
assemble capital and ability, and coordinate them in constructive
enterprise.

A hundred years before the great Virginia adventure, Luther, Erasmus,
and Columbus rang down the curtain on the weary and confined drama of
the Middle Ages. Expanding horizons challenged man's vision and
intellect. Great courage made Englishmen adventurers in all things.

The charters here presented are among the world's great documents. The
first which was drawn while Sir Edward Coke was Lord Chief Justice is
replete with certain traditional and feudal principles, reverence for
the English common law and the supreme authority of the King and his
agents. The second, principally the work of the liberal Sir Edwin Sandys
with the approving participation of Sir Francis Bacon, great exponent of
natural law, marks a transition from government by arbitrary royal
authority to the concept that government rests on the consent of the
governed and on the fundamental right of man to enjoy the fruits of his
labor. Students may read in this charter the first principles of the
American Constitution. The third charter is an attempt to refine
principles enunciated in the second in the light of experience. In
addition to its political significance, the second charter proved a
tremendous stimulus to the Virginia enterprise.

Gondomar, the Spanish Ambassador, wrote to his King that "fourteen
Counts and Barons have given 40,000 ducats, the merchants give much more
and there is no poor little man or woman who is not willing to subscribe
something." The landed aristocracy, gentry, merchants, and yeomen had
joined in a company which they directed to provide capital and ability
for a great enterprise.

The text of the three charters of the Virginia Company is taken from a
contemporary copy recently discovered among the Chancery Rolls of the
Public Record Office in London--contemporary enrollments "representing
the official text of the charters kept in official custody," according
to the Deputy Keeper, Mr. D. L. Evans. A photostatic copy of this
manuscript is in possession of the Virginia State Library. Each charter
was transcribed in England by Doctor Nellie J. M. Kerling for the
editor's use.

Heretofore scholars have had access to the charters only through the
text in William Stith's _The History of the First Discovery and
Settlement of Virginia_ (Williamsburg, Printed by William Parks, 1747),
in sources based upon this, or in Alexander Brown's _The Genesis of the
United States_ (Boston, 1890).

No original of any of the charters is known to exist, although other
copies of varying degrees of completeness have been located in England
and on the continent. One copy, made with the authority of the Governor,
Council, and House of Burgesses of the Colony, was used as evidence to
support a petition against Lord Culpeper's land grants. This is included
in the Henry Coventry papers in the library of the Marquess of Bath at
Longleat, Wiltshire, England (Vol. LXXVI, _Papers relating to Virginia,
Barbados, and other Colonies, 1606-1675_). These documents have been
microfilmed by the American Council of Learned Societies, "British
Manuscripts Project." Many of them will soon be published by the
Virginia Historical Society under the editorship of Dr. W. E. Washburn.

Another copy of the charters is in the Public Record Office, "Entry
books of letters, commissions, instructions, charters, warrants,
patents, grants, etc." (formerly "Record book No. LXXIX"), an abstract
of which appears in the _Calendar of State Papers, Colonial Series_,
Vol. I. Microfilm copies of this text are in the Library of Congress and
the Virginia State Library. Other copies have recently been discovered
in France and Spain by Dr. George Reese who has been employed by the
Virginia 350th Anniversary Celebration Corporation to search foreign
libraries for documentary material pertinent to the study of 17th
century Virginia. Ultimately, microfilm copies of these records will be
made available to research libraries in the United States.

The seven accompanying documents, included to illustrate the practical
rather than theoretical basis of the administration of the Colony, have
been taken from the best available manuscript or printed source. These
official papers, together with the three charters of the Virginia
Company, may be termed the constitutions and are the basic sources for
the study of the Colony during the first fifteen years of its existence.

A few necessary liberties have been taken in transcribing these
documents: abbreviations and contractions have been spelled out,
capitalization and punctuation have been adjusted according to modern
usage and, to prevent possible confusion, certain letters used
interchangeably (such as "i" and "j", "v" and "u") are employed
according to twentieth century practice. In the text of the three
charters, omitted words or phrases have been supplied in brackets from
the text in Stith. Brackets are also employed to supply the name of an
adventurer if there is any deviation in spelling between Stith and the
manuscript version: _e.g._, "Sir Charles Willmott, Knight [Wilmot]."

This publication owes its issuance to the inspiration and leadership
furnished by Dr. Earl G. Swem, Librarian Emeritus of the College of
William and Mary. I should like also to acknowledge the faithful
transcription of the text by Dr. Nellie J. N. Kerling, and the deep
interest and active support of Dr. Gertrude R. B. Richards, who most
patiently assisted in the transcription; also to Mr. Francis L.
Berkeley, Jr., Archivist of the Alderman Library, University of Virginia
and to Mr. John M. Jennings, Director of the Virginia Historical
Society. To Mr. James A. Servies, Reference Librarian of the Library of
William and Mary College, has fallen the arduous and difficult task of a
comparative, detailed study of all the texts in the different versions.
The printed text in these pages is from a typed copy by Mr. Servies,
prepared with the most painstaking application, as the result of the
comparison of copies transcribed by Dr. Kerling and Dr. Richards, and of
the printed pages in Stith. The merit of an accurate and readable text
must be ascribed to the industry and scholarly perception of Mr.
Servies.

MAY 23, 1609


James, by the grace of God [King of England, Scotland, France and
Ireland, defender of the faith, etc.] To all [to whom these presents

Whereas, at the humble suite and request of sondrie oure lovinge and
well disposed subjects intendinge to deduce a colonie and to make
habitacion and plantacion of sondrie of oure people in that parte of
America comonlie called Virginia, and other part and territories in
America either apperteyninge unto us or which are not actually possessed
of anie Christian prince or people within certaine bound and regions,
wee have formerly, by oure lettres patents bearinge date the tenth of
Aprill in the fourth yeare of oure raigne of England, Fraunce, and
Ireland, and the nine and thirtieth of Scotland, graunted to Sir Thomas
Gates, Sir George Somers and others, for the more speedie accomplishment
of the said plantacion and habitacion, that they shoulde devide
themselves into twoe collonies--the one consistinge of divers Knights,
gentlemen, merchaunts and others of our cittie of London, called the
First Collonie; and the other of sondrie Knights, gentlemen and others
of the citties of Bristoll, Exeter, the towne of Plymouth, and other
places, called the Seccond Collonie--and have yielded and graunted maine
and sondrie priviledges and liberties to each Collonie for their quiet
setlinge and good government therein, as by the said lettres patents
more at large appeareth.

Nowe, forasmuch as divers and sondrie of oure lovinge subjects, as well
adventurers as planters, of the said First Collonie (which have alreadie
engaged them selves in furtheringe the businesse of the said plantacion
and doe further intende by the assistance of Almightie God to prosecute
the same to a happie ende) have of late ben humble suiters unto us that,
in respect of their great chardeges and the adventure of manie of their
lives which they have hazarded in the said discoverie and plantacion of
the said countrie, wee woulde be pleased to graunt them a further
enlargement and explanacion of the said graunte, priviledge and
liberties, and that suche counsellors and other officers maie be
appointed amonngest them to manage and direct their affaires [as] are
willinge and readie to adventure with them; as also whose dwellings are
not so farr remote from the cittye of London but that they maie at
convenient tymes be readie at hande to give advice and assistance upon
all occacions requisite.

We, greatlie affectinge the effectual prosecucion and happie successe of
the said plantacion and comendinge their good desires theirin, for their
further encouragement in accomplishinge so excellent a worke, much
pleasinge to God and profitable to oure Kingdomes, doe, of oure speciall

  VIRGINIA COUNCIL. "INSTRUCCIONS
  ORDERS AND CONSTITUCIONS ...
  TO SR THOMAS GATES KNIGHT GOVERNOR
  OF VIRGINIA"




MAY, 1609


    Instructions, orders and constitucions by way of advise sett
    downe, declared and propounded to Sir Thomas Gates, Knight,
    Governor of Virginia and of the Colony there planted and to
    be planted, and of all the inhabitants thereof, by us His
    Majesties Counsell for the direction of the affaires of that
    countrey for his better disposinge and proceedinge in the
    government thereof accordinge to the authority and power
    given unto us by virtue of His Majesties lettres patents.

1. Havinge considered the greate sufficiency and zealous affection which
you, Sir Thomas Gates, have many waies manifested unto us, and havinge
therefore by our Commission under our hands and seales constituted and
ordained you to be the Governor of Virginia, wee His Majesties Counsell
for that plantacion, have consulted and advised uppon divers
instructions for your safer and more deliberate proceedinge therein; and
therefore doe requier and charge you, accordinge to the Comission in
that behalf directed unto you, presently with all convenient speede to
take the charge and of our fleete consistinge of eight good shippes and
one pinnace and of sixe hundred land men to be transported under your
commaund, and with the first winde to sett saile for Virginia. And in
your passage thither you shall not land nor touch any of the Kinge of
Spaines his Dominions quetly possessed, without the leave or licence of
the governor of such place as you shal by accident or contrary windes be
forced into. You shall also hold counsell with the masters and pilotts
and men of the best experience what way is safest and fittest for you to
take, because we hold it daungerous that you should keepe the old course
of Dominico and Meins lest you fall into the hand of the Spaniard, who
may attend in that roade ready to intercept you:

2. When it shall please God that you have safely attained the Kings
River, and our porte and seate of James Towne in Virginia, wee advise
you to call by proclamacion into some publique place, all the governors,
officers, and other His Majesties subjects aswell already seated there
as transported with you, to whom you shall cause your Commission to be
directly reade, whereby significacion may be had of His Majesties
pleasure in establishinge you the Governor of that countrey and
plantacion, and the President, Councell and Colony there may take notice
of the revocacion of that fourme of governement by the first lettres
patents constituted and confirmed, and accordingly yeald due obedience
unto you, their Governor.

3. You shall demaund then and resume into your hands the former lettres
pattents and all instruccions & publique instruments given or sent unto
them and all bookes and records whatsoever of the generall proceedings
untill this time, and dispose of them in the future accordinge to your
discrecion.

4. Beinge setled in your government, you shall call unto you, for your
further advise and graver proceedinge, their principall officers and
gentlemen whom we do ordaine and appointe to be of the Councell and who
for earliness of their undertakings and their greate paines and merits
doe well deserve this honor & respect from us: Sir George Summers,
Knight, and Admirall of Virginia; Captaine John Smith, nowe President;
Captaine John Radclif; Captaine Peter Winne, Seirjant Major of the fort;
Mr. Mathewe Scrivenor, whom out of our good experience of his abilities
in that kinde we doe name and appointe to be Secretary of that Councell;
Captaine John Martine; Captaine Richard Waldoe, master of the workes;
Captaine Woode; and Mr. Fleetwoode, whom we assure ourselves you will
use with all good respecte in their places and to whome wee expecte that
you shall give such other preferrements as their former paines have
deserved, and in all matters of importance we require you to call them
to consultacion and to proceede therein with their advice; and wee doe
give further power and authority to you, to give the oathe of Counsellor
to such as are now named, or any other oathe in the like case,
accordinge to your direccion. Provided that they shall not have, single
nor together, anie bindinge or negative voice or power uppon your
conclusions but doe give you full authority, uppon just occasion to
sequester any of them from the execucion of any place whatsover, and to
depute another thereunto untill significacion unto us be here made:

5. You shall have power and authority to dispose and graunte any other
officer or commaunds whatsoever, either of governement or warr, except
such as are already disposed of by us to any persons of rancke or merite
(adventurers beings first regarded), accordinge to your discrecion and
so discharge or revoke the same or to sequester any so made or
constituted by us.

6. You shall take principall order and care for the true and reverent
worship of God that his worde be duely preached and his holy sacraments
administred accordinge to the constitucions of the Church of England in
all fundamentall pointes, and his ministers had in due observance and
respecte agreeable to the dignity of their callinge. And that all
atheisme, prophanes, popery, or schisme be exemplarily punished to the
honor of God and to the peace and safety of his Church, over which, in
this tendernes and infancy, you must be especially solicitous &
watchefull.

7. You shall, with all propensenes and diligence, endeavour the
conversion of the natives to the knowledge and worship of the true God
and their redeemer Christ Jesus, as the most pious and noble end of this
plantacion, which the better to effect you must procure from them some
convenient nomber of their children to be brought up in your language
and manners, and if you finde it convenient, we thinke it reasonable you
first remove from them their Iniocasockes or Priestes by a surprise of
them all and detaininge them prisoners, for they are so wrapped up in
the fogge and miserie of their iniquity and so tirrified with their
continuall tirrany, chained under the bond of deathe unto the divell
that while they live amounge them to poison and infecte them their
mindes, you shall never make any great progres into this glorious worke,
nor have any civill peace or concurre with them. And in case of
necessity or conveniency, we pronounce it not crueltie nor breache of
charity to deale more sharpely with them and to proceede even to dache
[death?] with these murtherers of soules and sacrificers of God's images
to the divill, referringe the consideracion of this as a waighty matter
of important consequence to the circumstances of the busines and place
in your discrecion.

8. You shall for capitall and criminal justice in case of rebellion and
mutiny and in all such cases of [provident (?)] necessity, proceede by
martiall lawe accordinge to your comission as of most dispatch and
terror and fittest for this governement; and in all other causes of that
nature as also in all matters of civill justice, you shall finde it
properest and usefullest for your governement to proceede rather as a
chauncelor than as a judge, rather uppon the naturall right and equity
then uppon the nicenes and lettre of the lawe which perplexeth in this
tender body, rather then dispatcheth all causes so that a summary and
arbitrary way of justice discreetely mingled with those gravities and
fourmes of magistracy as shall in your discrecion seeme aptest for you
and that place, wilbe of most use both for expedicion and for example:

9. You shall for the more regard and respect of your place, to begett
reverence to your authority and to refresh their mindes that obey the
gravity of those lawes under which they were borne; at your discrecion
use such fourmes and ensignes of governement as by our lettres pattents
wee are enabled to grant unto you; as also the attendance of a guarde
uppon your person, and in all such like cases you shall have power to
make, adde or distinguishe any lawes or ordinances at your discrecion
accordinge to the authority limited in your comission.

10. You shall, for the choice of plantacions observe two generall
rulles: that you rather seeke to the sun then from it, which is under
God the first cause both of health and riches; and that such places
which you resolve to build and inhabite uppon have at the leaste one
good outlett into the sea & fresh water to the land; that it be a dry
and wholesome earth and as free from woode as possiblie you may, whereby
you may have roome to discover about you and unshady ground to plant
nere you.

11. You must in every plantacion principally provide of your owne a
common graunge and storehowse of corne, besides that which you will
obtaine by tribute or trade with the natives.

12. In the distribucion of your men accordinge to these advises and
relacions which wee have receaved, we advise you to continue the
plantacion at James Towne with a convenient nomber of men, but not as
your situacion or citty, because the place is unwholsome and but in the
marish of Virginia, and to keepe it onely as a fitt porte for your
shippes to ride before to arive and unlade att; butt neither shall you
make it your principall storehowse or magazin either of armes, victualls
or goods, but because it is so accessable with shippinge that an enemy
may be easily uppon you with all the provision of ordinance and municion
and it is not to be expected that anie fortificacion there can endure an
enemy that hath the leasure to sitt downe before it.

13. The place you chose for your principall residence and seate to have
your catle, provisions of corne, foode, and magazin of other municion
in, as your greatest strength, trust and retraite, must be removed some
good distance from any navigable river, except with small boates, by
which no enemy shall dare to seeke your habitacion; and if in this place
some good fortificacion be made to which no ordinance can be brought by
water, if you be provided of victuall, you may dispute possession till a
straunger be wearied and starved.

14. Above the over falles of the Kinges River it is likely you shall
finde some convenient place to this purpose whither no enemy with ease
can approache nor with ordinance at all but by land, with at howe greate
disadvauntage he shall seeke when he must discover and fight at once
uppon straightes, in woodes, at foordes, and places of all
inconveniency, is easy to be considered; besides, you shall have the
commodity of the braunche of the river to bringe downe your provisions
from within the land in canooes and smalle boates in the River of
Chechehounnack, neere unto you and not farre of another navagable
outlett into the sea by the River of Pamaouke.

15. Foure dayes journey from your forte southewards is a towne called
Ohonahorn seated where the River of Choanocki devideth it self into
three braunches and falleth into the sea of Rawnocke in thirtie five
degrees; this place, if you seeke by Indian guides from James forte to
Winocke by water, from thence to Manqueocke, some twenty miles from
thence to Caththega, as much and from thence to Oconahoen, you shall
finde a brave and fruiteful seate every way unaccessable by a straunger
enemy, much more abundant in pochon and in the grasse silke called Cour
del Cherva and in vines, then any parte of this land knowne unto us.
Here we suppose, if you make your principall and cheife seate, you shall
doe most safely and richely because you are in the part of the land
inclined to the southe, and two of the best rivers will supply you;
besides you are neere to riche copper mines of Ritanoc and may passe
them by one braunche of this river, and by another, Peccarecamicke,
where you shall finde foure of the Englishe alive, left by Sir Walter
Rawely, which escaped from the slaughter of Powhaton of Roanocke, uppon
the first arrivall of our Colonie, and live under the proteccion of a
wiroane called Gepanocon, enemy to Powhaton by whose consent you shall
never recover them; one of these were worth much labour, and if you
finde them not, yet seach [search?] into this countrey, it is more
probable then towards the north.

16. These three habitations seeme enoughe for the nomber of the people
nowe transported, over every one of which you must appointe a discreete
commaunder that shall sett your men to severall workes accordinge to
their undertakings in the bookes by which they were receaved; in every
one of these there must be builte a church and a storehowse and a parte
of land sett out for corne for the publique and some allotted to the
care of manuringe and preparinge thereof. In buildinge your towns you
shall as easily keepe decorous and order as confusion; and so you shall
prepare for ornament and safety at once, for every streete may answere
one another and all of them the markett place or storehowse in the midle
which at the leaste must be paved and made firme and dry.

17. Your enemies can be but of two sortes, straungers and natives; for
the first, your defence must be uppon advauntage of the place and way
unto it, for fortes have no other use but that a fewe men may defend and
dispute their footinge with them against a greater nomber and to winne
time which, if you can do, a stranger cannot longe abide where he must
bringe all his releis [relief?] with him, and he shall have no way to
beseidge you but by blockinge you in and plantinge between you and the
sea, to which if you have two outeletts he must be very able and
powerfull that can do it; to prevent this you shall build some small
forte that may discry the sea neere Cape Comforte, and there hold a
reasonable garrison and keepe alwaies watch and longe boate that may be
ready to take the alarum and able to cary away our men, and munition if
you shall not be able to defend it. Besides it is not safe to lett any
of the savages dwell betwene you and the sea least they be made guides
to your enemies. To this commaunde wee desire Captaine Smith may be
allotted aswell for his earnest desire as the greate confidence & trust
that we have in his care & diligence.

18. The second enemy is the natives who can no way hurte you but by fire
or by destroyinge your catle, or hinderinge your workes by stealth or
your passages in small nombers; and in this sorte of warr there is most
perill if you be not very carefull, for if they may destroy but one
harvest or burne your townes in the night they will leave you naked and
exposed to famine and cold, and convey themselves into wodes where
revenge wilbe as difficult as unnecessary; to prevent that you must
keepe good watches in the fielde and suffer none of them to come nere
your corne in those daungerous seasons; and continuall centinells
without the walles or uttermost defences in the night; and you must give
order that your catle be kept in heards waited and attended on by some
small watch or so enclosed by them selves that they destroy not your
corne and other seed provisions.

19. For Powhaton and his Weroances it is clere even to reason beside our
experience that he loved not our neighbourhood and therefore you may no
way trust him, but if you finde it not best to make him your prisoner
yet you must make him your tributary, and all other his weroances about
him first to acknowledge no other lord but Kinge James, and so we shall
free them all from the tirrany of Powhaton ... uppon them. Every lord of
a province shall pay you and send you into your forte where you make
your cheif residence so many measures of corne at every harvest, soe
many basketts of dye, so many dozens of skins, so many of his people to
worke weekely, and of every thinge somewhat, accordinge to his
proporcion in greatenes of territory and men; by which meanes you shall
quietly drawe to your selves an annuall revenue of every commodity
growinge in that countrey and this tribute payd to you, for which you
shall deliver them from the exeacions of Powhaton which are now
burdensome, and protect and defend them from all their enemies; shall
also be a meanes of clearinge much ground of wood and of reducing them
to laboure and trade seinge for this rent onely they shall enjoye their
howses, and the rest of their travell quietly and many other commodities
and blessings of which they are yet insensible.

20. If you hope to winne them and to provide for your selves by trade
you wilbe deceaved, for already your copper is embased by your abundance
and neglect of prisinge it and they will never feede you but for feare.
Wherefore, if you perceave that they, uppon your landinge, fly up into
the countrey and forsake their habitacion, you must seise into your
custody half there corne and harvest and their Weroances and all other
their knowne successors at once whom, if you intreate well and educate
those which are younge and to succeede in the governement in your
manners and religion, their people will easily obey you and become in
time civill and Christian.

21. If you make freindship with any of these nations, as you must doe,
choose to doe it with those that are farthest from you and enemies unto
those amonge whom you dwell, for you shall have least occasion to have
differences with them and by that meanes a suerer league of amity, and
you shalbe suer of their trade partely for covetousnes and to serve
their owne ends, where the copper is yett in his primary estimacion
which Pohaton hath hitherto engrossed and partely for feare of
constrainte. Monocon, to the east and head of our river, Powhatons
enemy; and the Manahockes, to the northeast to the head of the River of
Moyompo in the necke of the land to the west betweene our bay and the
sea; Cathcatapeius, a greater Weroance then he is, also his enemy to the
Southeast and South--he hath no freinde to the north; the Masawoymekes
make continuall incursions uppon him and uppon all those that inhabite
the Rivers of Bolus and Myomps and to the northwest; Pocoughtuwonough
infecteth him with a terrible warr. With those you may hold trade and
freindeship good cheape for their emotenes [remoteness?] will prevent
all offence which must needes happen betweene us and them which we are
mingled with to the North. At the head bay is a large towne where is
store of copper and furres called Cataaneon that trade and discovery
wilbe to greate purpose, if it may be setled yearely.

22. Such trade as you shall finde necessary or profitable for you with
the Indians you shall endeavour to drawe them to seeke of you and to
bringe their commodities into your forte, which will greatly ease the
imployment of many men, and this you may bringe to passe by seeminge to
make litle estimacion of trade with them and by pretendinge to be so
able to consist within your selves as that you neede care for nothinge
of theires, but rather that you doe them a curtesy to spare such
necessaries as they want as leetle iron tooles, or copper, or the like
such as are convenient for traffique; and so one officer or two in every
forte, whom you must onely appointe to be truncmasters, may dispatch the
whole busines of trade which els will cost you many mens laboures if you
seeke it far from home. And besides these you must, by proclamacion or
edicte publiquely affixed, prohibite and forbidd uppon paine or
punishement of your discrecion all other persons to trade or exchange
for anythinge but such as shalbe necessarie for foode or clothinge; and
uppon all such commodities of yours as shall passe away from you
whatsoever, you must sett prises and values under which the
trunckemaster must not trade, and so you shalbe such to uphold the
reputacion of your commodity and to make your traffique rich, desired
and certaine; over this truncemaster there must be appointed a cape
merchant or officer belonginge to the store or provision house that must
deliver by booke all such things as shalbe allowed for trade and receave
and take an accounte of whatsover is retourned, accordinge to the prises
therein sett, and so beinge booked must store them up, to the publique
use of the colony.

23. You must constitute and declare some sharpe lawe with a penaltie
thereon to restraine the trade of any prohibited goods, especially of
swordes, pikeheads, gunnes, daggers, or any thinge of iron that may be
turned against you, and in case of such offence punishe severely; have
also especially regard that no arte or trade tendinge to armes in any
wise, as smithey, carpentry, of or such like, be taught the savages or
used in their presence, as they may learne therein.

24. Havinge deduced your colony into severall seates and plantacions
that may commodiously answere and receive one another, you must devide
your people into tennes, twenties, & so upwards, to every necessary
worke a competent nomber, over every one of which you must appointe some
man of care and [skill] in that worke to oversee them and to take daily
accounte of their laboures; and you must ordaine that every overseer of
such a nomber of workemen deliver once a weeke an accounte of the wholle
committed to his charge [to] the cheife governor or captaine of the
fourte; and that they also once a moneth make the like accounte to you
or your officer and that such goodes or provisions as are advanced or
gotten above expence may be receaved and entred into the capemarchantes
booke and so stored and preserved to the publique use of the colony. And
thus you shall both knowe howe your men are imployed, what they gett &
where it is, as also the measure of your provision and wealth.

25. For such of your men as shall attend any worke in or nere aboute
every towne, you shall doe best to lett them eate together at seasonable
howers in some publique place, beinge messed by sixe or five to a messe,
in which you must see there bee equality and sufficient that so they may
come and retourne to their worke without any delay and have no cause to
complaine of measure or to excuse their idlenes uppon the dressinge or
want of diett. You may well allowe them three howers in a somers day and
two in the winter, and shall call them together by ringinge of a bell
and by the same worne them againe to worke; for such as attend any
labouer so farre from the forte, as they cannot returne at seasonable
times, there must be a steward appointed that shall oversee there diett
and provision, els thoughe you give every one a reasonalbe allowance for
many dayes some will eate two meales at one & soe:

26. You shall give especiall order to the cheif commaunder of every
forte that the armes, powder and munition be well stored and looked into
and that the men be disposed into severall companies for warr and
captaines appointed over every fifty to traine them at convenient times
and to teache them the use of their armes and weapons and they may knowe
whether uppon all occasions and sudden attempts they shall repaire to
find them in a readines.

27. You must take especiall care what relacions come into England and
what lettres are written and that all thinges of that nature may be
boxed up and sealed and sent to first to the Councell here, accordinge
to a former instruccion unto the late president in that behalf directed;
and that at the arivall and retourne of every shippinge you endeavour to
knowe all the particuler passages and informacions given on both sides
and to advertise us accordingly.

28. Whensoever you consult of any busines of importance, wee advise you
to consider and deliberate all thinges patiently & willingly and to
heare every man his oppinion and objeccion, but the resultants out of
them or your owne determinacion what you intend to doe not to imparte to
any whatsoever, but to such onely as shall execute it, and to them also
under the sealle of your commaundement and but at the instant of their
partinge from you or the execucion of your will.

29. Next after buildinge, husbandry and manuringe the countrey for the
provision of life and conveniency, wee comend unto your care foure
principall waies of enrichinge the colonies and providinge returne of
commodity, of which you must be very solicitouse that our fleetes come
not home empty nor laden with useles marchandize. The first is discovery
either of the southe seas or royall mines, in the search of both which
we must referre you to the circumstances of your peace and your owne
discrecion; the second is trade whereby you recover all the commodities
of those countreys that ly far of and yet are accessable by water; the
third is tribute, by which you shall advaunce parte of what soever the
next lande can provide you can produce; the fourth is labour of your
owne men in makinge wines, pitche, tarre, sope, ashes, steele, iron,
pipestaves, in sowinge of hempe and flaxe, in gatheringe silke of the
grasse, and providinge the worme and in fishinge for pearle, codd,
sturgion, and such like.

30. Wee require you to call before you Captaine John Radcliffe and one
... Webbe who hath complained by peticion delivered unto you of divers
injuries and insolences done unto him in the governement of the said
Captaine Radcliffe, and accordingly to heare the cause and doe justice
in it as you shall finde reason in it your owne discrecion.

31. Whereas suite hath bine made unto us as for the retourne of Richard
Potts, David Wiffin and Post Ginnet, and sufficient reasons declared to
move us to graunte the same which hath bine agreed unto by the Councell
assembled, wee require you to give them their licence to come backe by
the next shippinge with such condicions or limitacions of retorne or
otherwise as you shall thinke good.

32. Whereas peticion hath bine made by the friends of John Tavernor,
capemarchant of the forte and store in Virginia, for his retorne uppon
some urgent occasion and for some time into England, we require you to
licence him so to do if it be his desire when you arive there; and we
doe nominate and appointe Thomas Wittingham into his roome and office,
beinge one in whose sufficiency and honesty we have greate confidence.

33. There beinge one George Liste, servant to John Woodall and sent over
by him with a chest of cheurgery sufficiently furnished, we require you
to give your licence to William Wilson, his fellowe, if the said George
Liste doe stay with you, to come backe in this passage, the better to
enfourme us what medicines and drugges are fittest to be provided for
the use of the colonie against the next supply.

34. You shall be very wary of grantinge freedomes and of givinge your
sealle to any but uppon good consideracion and greate merite, least you
make cheape the best way of our recompence; and in those you doe you
shall give with such limitacions of retorne in reasonable time as in
your discrecion shall seeme good.

35. If it shall please God that you should dy either in your way or in
your governement (which his mercy forbid) before other order be taken by
us therein, wee requier and commaund that the Councell there established

  VIRGINIA COUNCIL. "INSTRUCTIONS,
  ORDERS AND CONSTITUCIONS ... TO ...
  SIR THOMAS WEST, KNIGHT, LORD LA
  WARR."




1609/10(?)


    Instructions, orders and constitucions by way of advise sett
    downe, declared, propounded and delivered to the Right
    Honourable Sir Thomas West, Knight, Lord La Warr, Lord
    Governor and Capten Generall of Virginea and of the Colonies
    there planted and to be planted and of all other the
    inhabitants thereof, by us, His Majesties Counsell for the
    Companie of Adventurers and Planters in Virginea resident in
    England under the hands of some of us for the direccion of
    the affares of that countrey for his better disposinge and
    proceedinge in the government thereof, according to the
    authoritie and power given unto us by His Majesties lettres
    patents in that behalf, together with a copie of certaine of
    the cheifest instruccions which have bene formerlie given to
    Sir Thomas Gates, Knight, for his direccion, which coppie we
    have given to his Lordship to peruse and looke into but
    leave it to his discretion to use and put them in execution
    or to beare to be advised or directed by them further then
    in his owne discretion he shall thinke meete.

We, the said Councell, havinge considered the great & zealous affeccion
which you, Sir Thomas West, Knight, Lord Lawarr, have many wayes
manifested unto us and for the furtherance and advaunceinge of the
plantacion of Virginea have therefore by our commission under the handes
of some of us, constituted you to be Lord Governor and Captaine Generall
of Virginea and for your more safe and deliberate proceedinge in your
goverment there, have advised, constituted & agreed uppon divers
instructions followinge, vizt:

1. First, we require your Lordship to take into your charge our fleete
consistinge of three good shippes with the masters, mariners, sailors
and one hundred and fiftie landmen goinge in them to be transported
under your commaund with what speed conveniently you maye unto Virginea
and with the first winde to sett saile for that place and in your
passage thither not to lande or touche uppon anye of the Kinge of Spaine
his dominions by him quietly possessed without the licence of the
governour of such place first obtained, unles by necessitie of winde and
weather you shalbe forced thereunto; in which passage you shall holde
councell with the masters, pilates and men of best experience what way
is safest and fitt for you to take for your arrivinge in Virginea.

2. Your Lordships beinge landed there, we wishe you should (with what
convenientcy you may by proclamacion made) call into some publique place
all the governors, officers and other His Majesties subjects, aswell
already seated there as transported with you, to whom you shall manifest
your commission and cause it to be publiquely read to them, to the end
His Majesties pleasure may be knowne as alsoe our choise in
establishinge your Lordship Governor of Virginea and of the plantacion
there; and that the President, Counsell and Colony there may take notice
of our revocacion of all former kindes and formes of goverment,
constituted or confirmed, and that they accordingely may yeild due
obedience unto you, theire Lord Governor and Captaine Generall, at which
time we holde it fitt you tender unto every of them the oath of
supremacy to be by them taken whereby they shall manifest theire
obedience and loyaltie to His Majestie and you thereby the better
assured of theire fidelities as alsoe to be the rather encouraged to
comitt matter of counsell and charge unto them; att which time alsoe
your Lordship shall, in our opinions, doe well to give generall
commaundement that all former private or publique quarels, greivancs or
grudgs be from thenceforth from amongest them utterly abbandoned and
forgotten and they willingly embrace peace and love as becommeth
Christians without discention or hindrance to the common good or quiet.

3. Moreover, your Lordship shall demaunde and resume into your hands all
former commissions and all instructions and publique instruments given
or sent unto them and all bookes and records whatsoever of all the
proceedings untill this time and dispose of all theire offices and
places in the future accordinge to your discretion; except the office of
Leiuetennante Governor, which your Lordship is by your commission to
bestowe upon Sir Thomas Gates, if he shalbe there to execute the same,
and office of Marshall uppon Sir Thomas Dale, at this cominge thither,
and the office of Admirall upon Sir George Sumers, if he shalbe there,
and the office of Viceadmirall upon Capten Newport, he beinge there to
supplye the said place.

4. Your shippes beinge discharged of theire provision, we wishe that
they, the seamen and soe manie others as shalbe needfull for that worke,
be, with what convenient speed you may, employed to theire fishinge for
sturgeons and other fish; which done we desier your Lordship should make
up the residue of theire fraight with divers of the best severall
patternes of the land, commodities that you can gett there havinge
regarde more to the goodnes and qualitie of them then to the quantity;
and to retorne the said shippes for England with as quick dispatch as
you may for easinge of the Companie of Adventurers of the charge both of
wages of the said shippes, seamen and victualls which they must be att
untill they retorne.

5. After your Lordship is settled in your governement, we thinke it very
behofefull that you employ soe many of your people as shalbe needfull in
sowing, setting and plantinge of corne and such rootes for foode as you
for your better provision, sustentacion and maintennance shall thinke
meete to be planted.

6. As touchinge your landmen, we thinke fitt your Lordship should reduce
them all into severall bandes and companies of fifties or more when you
thinke good and to committ the charge of them to severall officers and
captaines to be exercised and trained up in martiall manner and warlike
discipline.

7. Your Lordship is to take principall order and care for the true
worship and service of God as by havinge the Gospell preched, frequent
prayers and the sacraments often administred as becommeth Christians.
And that such your ministers and preachers as shalbe with you be had in
due respect agreable to theire dignitie and callinge and that your
Lordship, with the counsell of your said prechers and ministers, doe, as
occasion shall be offered, proceede in punishinge of all atheisme,
prophanisme, popery and scisme by exemplary punishment to the honor of
God and to the peace and safety of his church over which in this
tendernes and infancy your Lordship must be especially solicitous and
watchfull.

8. It is very expedient that your Lordship with all diligence indeavor
the conversion of the natives and savages to the knowledge and worship
of the true God and theire redemer Christ Jesus as the most pious and
noble end of this plantacion; which the better to effecte you are to
procure from them some of theire children to be brought up in our
language and manners and, if you finde it convenient, we thinke it
necesserie you first remove from them the iniococks or priests by a
surprise of them and detaninge them prisoners and in case they shalbe
willfull and obstinate then to send over some three or foure of them
into England, we may endevor theire conversion here.

9. We holde it requisite that your Lordship in causes of civill justice,
proceede rather as a counsellor then as a judge; that is to saie, rather
uppon the right and equitie of the thinge in demaunde then uppon the
nicenes and letter of the lawe, which perplexeth in this tender body
rather then dispatcheth causes. Soe that a summary and arbitrary way of
justice, mingled with discreet formes of magistracy as shall in your
discretion seeme aptest for your Lordship to exercise in that place,
wilbe of most use both for expedicion and example and for criminall
causes, you are to deale therein according to your comission and good
discretion.

10. That your Lordship doe not permitt any shippe or vessell to trade or
traffique within your precincte to carrie from thence any commodities or
marchandizes without warrant brought you or sent to your Lordship from
the Councell for the Company of Adventurers under the Councell seale.

11. We doe require your Lordship that with what possible speed and
conveniency you may, after you are setled, you appointe a convenient
number with guides and some discreete commaunder to discover northwest,
south and southwest, beyonde the faulls ten or twelve dayes journey, and
that assone as may be your Lordship send unto us the narracion of that
voyage what rivers, lakes or seas they finde or here of with the
circumstanc there unto belonginge.

12. If Sir Thomas Gates be there arived and Sir George Sommers and
Capten Newport, or any of them, that your Lordship doe give unto Sir
Thomas Gates the place or office of Leiuetennant Governor to your
Lordship duringe the time of your Lordship and his abode there together,
and in your Lordships absence he beinge there to be your deputy and
cheif generall and commaunder of the whole Colonye and Companie, and to
rule and governe according to suche instructions as your Lordship shall
limitt and appointe him; and that Sir George Sommers may have the office
of Cheif Admirall under your Lordship and that Sir Ferdinando Weyneman
may have the office of Master of the ordinance, and that Capten Newport
may have the office of Viceadmirall unto your Lordship.

13. Your Lordship must take especiall care what relacions come into
England and what lettres are written & that all things of that nature
may be boxed up and sealed and sent first to the Counsell here,
accordinge to a former instruction unto the late Governor in that behalf
directed; and that att the arrival and retorne of every shippinge you
endeavor to knowe all the particuler passages and informacions given on
both sides and to advertise us accordingly.

14. Last of all, for temporall goverment & perticuler proceedinge in
your plantacion, in respect of the shortnes of time, we commende unto
your Lordship the copie of some of the cheifest of the old instruccions
before mencioned to have bene formerly delivered to Sir Thomas Gates, to
be used or refused as you shall in your wisdome thinke fitt, neither is
or meanes to tie your Lordship to the stricte perfourmance of theis newe
instructions but as occasion of time, place or necessetie shall requir
your Lordship may doe therein as shall seeme best in your owne
discretion. Southampton, Pembroke, Philip Mountgomery, Edward Cecill,
Walter Cope, Dudly Diggs, William Rumney, Thomas Smith, Robert Drewrye,
Robert Maunsell, Baptist Hicks, Christofer Brooke.

The copie of the old instruccions which were formerly with others
delivered to Sir Thomas Gates, Knight, att his goinge to Virginea for
his direccion in his goverment there, and noew are by us, His Majesties
Councill for the Companie of Adventurers for Virginea, given to the
Right Honourable, the Lord La Warr to looke into and advise on and at
his discretion to use [or] forbeare to put them in execucion.

Such of the old instructions which were formerly given to Sir Thomas
Gates, Knight, and nowe delivered to the Lord La Warre, beginne att the
ninth instruccion in the articles in thi booke which by waye of advise
were sett down to the said Sir Thomas Gates and soe are written ontill
you come to the thirtith instruccion which 30th, 31, 32 & 33
instructions are not given his Lordship but the 34th is given him, but
not the 35 nor 36, but the effect of the provisoe followinge is given.

And we doe hereby ordaine and grannt by theis presents that the said
Treasurer and Companie of Adventurers and Planters, aforesaid, shall and
maie, once everie weeke or oftener at their pleasure, hold and keepe a
court and assembly for the better ordening [ordering] and government of

that anie five persons of the said Counsell for the said First Collonie
in Virginia, for the time being, of which Companie the Treasurer or his
deputie allwaies to be one, and the nomber of fifteene others at the
least of the generality of the said Companie assembled together in such
court or assembly in such manner as is and hath bin heretofore used and
accustomed, shalbe said, taken, held and reputed to be and shalbe a full
and sufficient court of the said Companie for the handling, ordring and
dispatching of all such casuall and particuler occurrences and
accidentall matters of lesse consequence and waight, as shall from time
to time happen, touching and concerning the said plantacion.

And that, nevertheles, for the handling, ordring and disposing of
matters and affaires of great waight and importance and such as shall or
maie in anie sort concerne the weale publike and generall good of the
said Companie and plantacion as namely, the manner of government from

possessions and the setling and establishing of a trade there, or such
like, there shalbe held and kept everie yeare uppon the last Wednesdaie
save one of Hillary, Easter, Trinity and Michaelmas termes, for ever,
one great, generall and solemne assembly, which fower severall
assemblies shalbe stiled and called The Fower Great and Generall Courts
of the Counsell and Companie of Adventurers for Virginia; in all and
every of which said great and generall Courts soe assembled our will and
pleasure is and we doe, for us, our heires and successors forever, give
and grannt to the said Treasurer and Companie and their successors for
ever by theis presents, that they, the said Treasurer and Companie or
the greater nomber of them soe assembled, shall and maie have full power
and authoritie from time to time and att all times hereafter to ellect
and choose discreet persons to be of our [said] Counsell for the said
First Colonie in Virginia and to nominate and appoint such officers as
theie shall thinke fitt and requisit for the government, managing,
ordring and dispatching of the affaires of the said Companie; and shall
likewise have full power and authority to ordaine and make such lawes
and ordinances for the good and wellfare of the said plantacion as to
them from time to time shalbe thought requisite and meete: soe allwaies
as the same be not contrary to the lawes and statutes of this our realme
of England; and shall in like manner have power and authority to
expulse, disfranchise and putt out of and from their said Companie and
societie for ever all and everie such person and persons as having
either promised or subscribed their names to become adventurers to the
said plantacion of the said First Colonie in Virginia, or having bin
nominated for adventurers in theis or anie our lettres patent or having
bin otherwise admitted and nominated to be of the said Companie, have
nevertheles either not putt in anie adventure [at] all for and towards
the said plantacion or els have refused and neglected, or shall refuse
and neglect, to bringe in his or their adventure by word or writing
promised within sixe monthes after the same shalbe soe payable and due.

And wheras the failing and nonpaiment of such monies as have bin
promised in adventure for the advanncement of the said plantacion hath
bin often by experience found to be danngerous and prejudiciall to the
same and much to have hindred the progresse and proceeding of the said
plantacion; and for that itt seemeth to us a thing reasonable that such
persons as by their handwriting have engaged themselves for the payment
of their adventures, and afterwards neglecting their faith and promise,
shold be compellable to make good and kepe the same; therefore our will
and pleasure is that in anie suite or suites comenced or to be comenced
in anie of our courts att Westminster, or elswhere, by the said
Treasurer and Companie or otherwise against anie such persons, that our
judges for the time being both in our Court of Channcerie and at the
common lawe doe favour and further the said suits soe farre forth as law
and equitie will in anie wise suffer and permitt.

And we doe, for us, our heires and successors, further give and grannt
to the said Tresorer and Companie, and their successors for ever, that
theie, the said Tresorer and Companie or the greater part of them for
the time being, so in a full and generall court assembled as aforesaid
shall and maie, from time to time and att all times hereafter, for ever,
ellect, choose and permitt into their Company and society anie person or
persons, as well straungers and aliens borne in anie part beyond the
seas wheresoever, being in amity with us, as our naturall liedge
subjects borne in anie our realmes and dominions; and that all such
persons soe elected, chosen and admitted to be of the said Companie as
aforesaid shall thereuppon be taken, reputed and held and shalbe free
members of the said Companie and shall have, hold and enjoie all and
singuler freedoms, liberties, franchises, priviledges, immunities,
benefitts, profitts and commodities, whatsoever, to the said Companie in
anie sort belonging or apperteining as fully, freely [and] amplie as
anie other adventurer or adventurers now being, or which hereafter att
anie time shalbe, of the said Companie, hath, have, shall, maie, might
or ought to have or enjoy the same to all intents and purposes
whatsoever.

And we doe further of our speciall grace, certaine knowledge and mere
mocion, for us, our heires and successors, give and grantt to the said
Tresorer and Companie and their successors, for ever by theis present,
that itt shalbe lawfull and free for them and their assignes att all and
everie time and times hereafter, out of anie our realmes and dominions
whatsoever, to take, lead, carry and transport in and into the said
voyage and for and towards the said plantacion of our said First
Collonie in Virginia, all such and soe manie of our loving subjects or
anie other straungers that will become our loving subjects and live
under our allegiance as shall willingly accompanie them in the said
voyage and plantacion; with shipping, armour, weapons, ordinannce,
munition, powder, shott, victualls, and all manner of merchandizes and
wares, and all manner of clothing, implement, furniture, beasts,
cattell, horses, mares, and all other thinges necessarie for the said
plantacion and for their use and defence, and for trade with the people
there and in passing and retourning to and froe, without paying or
yealding anie subsedie, custome or imposicion, either inward or outward,
or anie other dutie to us, our heires or successors, for the same, for
the space of seven yeares from the date of theis present.

And we doe further, for us, our heires and successors, give and grannt
to the said Treasurer and Companie and their successors for ever, by
theis present, that the said Treasurer of the said Companie, or his
deputie for the time being or anie twoe others of our said Counsell for
the said First Colonie in Virginia for the time being, shall and maie
attall times hereafter and from time to time, have full power and
authoritie to minister and give the oath and oathes of supremacie and
allegiannce, or either of them, to all and every person and persons
which shall, at anie time and times hereafter, goe or passe to the said
Colonie in Virginia:

And further, that itt shalbe likewise lawfull for the said Tresorer, or
his deputy for the time, or anie twoe others of our said Counsell for
the said First Colonie in Virginia, for the time being, from time to
time and att all times hereafter, to minister such a formall oathe as by
their discrescion shalbe reasonably devised, aswell unto anie person or
persons imployed or to be imployed in, for, or touching the said
plantacion for their honest, faithfull and just dischardge of their
service in all such matters as shalbe committed unto them for the good
and benefitt of the said Company, Colonie and plantacion; as alsoe unto
such other person or persons as the said Treasurer or his deputie, with
twoe others of the said Counsell, shall thinke meete for the examinacion
or clearing of the truith in anie cause whatsoever concerninge the said
plantacion or anie business from thence proceeding or there unto
proceeding or thereunto belonging.

And, furthermore, whereas we have ben certefied that diverse lewde and
ill disposed persons, both sailors, souldiers, artificers, husbandmen,
laborers, and others, having received wages, apparrell or other
entertainment from the said Company or having contracted and agreed with
the said Companie to goe, to serve, or to be imployed in the said
plantacion of the said First Colonie in Virginia, have afterwards either
withdrawen, hid or concealed themselves, or have refused to goe thither
after they have bin soe entertained and agreed withall; and that divers
and sundry persons allso which have bin sent and imployed in the said
plantacion of the said First Colonie in Virginia at and upon the chardge
of the said Companie, and having there misbehaved themselves by
mutinies, sedition, and other notorious misdemeanors, or having bin
employed or sent abroad by the governor of Virginia or his deputie with
some ship or pinnace for provisions for the said Colonie, or for some
discoverie or other buisines and affaires concerning the same, have from
thence most trecherouslie either come back againe and retorned into our
realme of England by stelth or without licence of our Governor of our
said Colonie in Virginia for the time being, or have bin sent hither as
misdoers and offenders; and that manie allsoe of those persons after
their retourne from thence, having bin questioned by our said Counsell
here for such their misbehaviors and offences, by their insolent and
contemptuous carriage in the presence of our said Counsaile, have shewed
little respect and reverence, either to the place or authoritie in which
we have placed and appointed them; and others, for the colouring of
their lewdnes and misdemeanors committed in Virginia, have endeavored
them by most vile and slanndrous reports made and divulged, aswell of
the cuntrie of Virginia as alsoe of the government and estate of the
said plantacion and Colonie, as much as in them laie, to bring the said
voyage and plantacion into disgrace and contempt; by meanes where of not
only the adventures and planters alreadie ingaged in the said plantacion
have bin exceedingly abused and hindred, and a greate nomber of other
our loving and welldisposed subjects otherwise well affected and
inclyning to joine and adventure insoe noble, Christian and worthie an
action have bin discouraged from the same, but allsoe the utter
overthrow and ruine of the said enterprise hath bin greatlie indanngered
which cannott miscarrie without some dishonor to us and our kingdome;

Now, for asmuch as it appeareth unto us that theis insolences,
misdemeanors and abuses, not to be tollerated in anie civill government,
have for the most part growne and proceeded inregard of our Counsaile
have not anie direct power and authoritie by anie expresse wordes in our
former lettres patent to correct and chastise such offenders, we
therefore, for the more speedy reformacion of soe greate and enormous
abuses and misdemeanors heretofore practised and committed, and for the
preventing of the like hereafter, doe by theis present for us, our
heires and successors, give and grannt to the said Treasurer and
Companie, and their successors for ever, that itt shall and maie be
lawfull for our said Councell for the said First Colonie in Virginia or
anie twoe of them, whereof the said Tresorer or his deputie for the time
being to be allwaies one, by warrant under their handes to send for, or
cause to be apprehended, all and every such person and persons who
shalbe noted or accused or found, att anie time or times here after, to
offend or misbehave themselves in anie the offences before mencioned and
expressed; and uppon the examinacion of anie such offender or offendors
and just proofe made by oath taken before the Counsaile of anie such
notorious misdemeanors by them committed as aforesaid; and allsoe uppon
anie insolent, contemptuous or unreverent carriage and misbehavior to or
against our said Counsell shewed or used by anie such person or persons
soe called, convented and apearing before them as aforesaid; that in all
such cases theie, our said Counsell or anie twoe of them for the time
being, shall and maie have full power and authoritie either here to
binde them over with good suerties for their good behaviour and further
therein to proceed to all intents and purposes, as itt is used in other
like cases within our realme of England; or ells att their discrescion
to remannd and send back the said offenders or anie of them unto the
said Colonie in Virginia, there to be proceeded against and punished as
the Governor, deputie and Counsell there for the time being shall thinke
meete; or otherwise, according to such lawes and ordinannces as are or
shalbe in use there for the well ordring and good governement of the
said Colonie.

And, for the more effectuall advanncing of the said plantacion, we doe
further, for us, our heires and successors, of our especiall grace and
favour, by vertue of our prorogative royall and by the assent and
consent of the Lordes and others of our Privie Counsalle, give and
grannte unto the said Tresorer and Companie full power and authoritie,
free leave, libertie and licence to sett forth, errect and publishe one
or more lotterie or lotteries to have continuance and to [endure] and be
held for the space of one whole yeare next after the opening of the
same, and after the end and expiracion of the said terme the said
lotterie or lotteries to continue and be further kept, during our will
and pleasure onely and not otherwise. And yet, nevertheles, we are
contented and pleased, for the good and wellfare of the said plantacion,
that the said Tresorer and Companie shall, for the dispatch and
finishing of the said lotterie or lotteries, have six months warninge
after the said yeare ended before our will and pleasure shall, for and
on that behalfe, be construed, deemed and adjudged to be in anie wise
altered and determined.

And our further will and pleasure is that the said lottery or lottaries
shall and maie be opened and held within our cittie of London or in anie
other cittie or citties, or ellswheare within this our realme of
England, with such prises, articles, condicions and limitacions as to
them, the said Tresorer and Companie, in their discreascions shall seeme
convenient.

And that itt shall and may be lawfull to and for the said Tresorer and
Companie to ellect and choose receivors, auditors, surveyors,
comissioners, or anie other officers whatsoever, att their will and
pleasure for the better marshalling and guiding and governing of the
said lottarie or lottaryes; and that itt shalbe likewise lawfull to and
for the said Tresorer and anie twoe of the said Counsell to minister
unto all and everie such persons soe ellected and chosen for officers as
aforesaid one or more oathes for their good behaviour, just and true
dealing in and about the lottarie or lottaries to the intent and purpose
that none of our loving subjects, putting in their monies or otherwise
adventuring in the said generall lotterie or lottaries, maie be in anie
wise defrauded and deceived of their said monies or evill and
indirectlie dealt withall in their said adventures.

And we further grannt in manner and forme aforesaid, that itt shall and
maie be lawfull to and for the said Treasurer and Companie, under the
scale of our Counsell for the plantacion, to publishe or to cause and
procure to be published by proclamacion or otherwise, the said
proclamacion to be made in their name by vertue of theise present, the
said lottarie or lotteries in all citties, townes, boroughts,
throughfaires and other places within our said realme of England; and we
will and commande all mayors, justices of peace, sheriffs, bayliffs,
constables and other our officers and loving subjects whatsoever, that
in noe wise theie hinder or delaie the progresse and proceeding of the
said lottarie or lottaries but be therein and, touching the premisses,
aiding and assisting by all honest, good and lawfull meanes and
endevours.

And further our will and pleasure is that in all questions and dobts
that shall arise uppon anie difficultie of construccion or
interpretacion of anie thing conteined in theis or anie other our former
lettres patent the same shalbe taken and interpreted in most ample and
beneficiall manner for the said Tresorer and Companie and their
successors and everie member there of.

And lastly we doe by theis present retifie and confirme unto the said
Treasorer and Companie, and their successors for ever, all and all
manner of priviledges, franchises, liberties, immunities, preheminences,

  VIRGINIA COMPANY. INSTRUCTIONS TO
  GEORGE YEARDLEY

  (Sometimes called "The Great Charter")[21]

    [Footnote 21: There is no authority in these Instructions
    for the Governor to establish a General Assembly. There is,

    a "Commission" was given to Yeardley which granted this
    authority.]




NOVEMBER 18, 1618


The Treasurer and Companie of Adventurers and Planters of the City of
London for the First Colony in Virginia to Captain George Yeardley,
Elect Governor of Virginia, and to the Council of State there being or
to be, greeting:

Our former cares and endeavours have been chiefly bent to the procuring
and sending people to plant in Virginia so to prepare a way and to lay a
foundation whereon a flourishing state might, in process of time by the
blessing of Almighty God, be raised. Now our trust being that under the
goverment of you, Captain Yeardly, with the advice and assistance of the
said Council of State, such public provisions of corn and cattle will
again be raised as may draw on those multitudes who, in great abundance
from diverse parts of the realm, were preparing to remove thither, if by
the late decay of the said public store their hopes had not been made
frustrate and their minds thereby clene discouraged. We have thought
good to bend our present cares and consultations, according to the
authority granted unto us from His Majesty under his Great Seal, to the
setling there of a laudable form of government by majestracy and just
laws for the happy guiding and governing of the people there inhabiting,
like as we have already done for the well ordering of our courts here
and of our officers and accions for the behoof of that plantation. And
because our intent is to ease all the inhabitants of Virginia forever of
all taxes and public burthens, as much as may be, and to take away all
occasion of oppression and corruption, we have thought fit to begin
(according to the laudable example of the most famous common wealthes
both past and present) to alot and lay out a convenient portion of
public lands for the maintenance and support as well of magistracy and
officers as of other public charges both here and there from time to
time arising. We, therefore, the said Treasurer and Company, upon a
solemn treaty and resolution and with the advice, consent and assent of
His Majesties Council here of Virginia, being assembled in a great and
general Court of the Council and Company of Adventurers for Virginia,
require you, the said Governor and Council of Estate, to put in
execution with all convenient speed a former order of our courts (which
had been commended also to Captain Argal at his making Deputy Governor)
for the laying and seting out by bounds and metes of three thousand
acres of land in the best and most convenient place of the territory of
James town in Virginia and next adjoining to the said town to be the
seat and land of the Governor of Virginia for the time being, and his
successors, and to be called by the name of the Governors Land, which
Governors Land shall be of the freed grounds by the common labor of the
people sent thither at the Companies charges, and of the lands formerly
conquered or purchased of the Paspeheies and of other grounds next
adjoining. In like sort we require you to set and lay out by bounds and
metes other three thousand acres of good land within the territory of
James town which shall be convenient, and in such place or places as in
your discretions you shall find meet; which latter three thousand acres
shall be and so called the Companies Land. And we require you, Captain
Yeardley, that immediately upon your arrival you take unto you the guard
assigned to Captain Argal at his going Deputy Governor, or sithence by
him assumed, to be of your guard [for the better defence][22] of your
Government; and that as well the said guard as also fifty other persons,
now sent and transported with you, you place as tennants on the said
Governors Land and that all other persons heretofore transported at the
common charge of the Company since the coming away of Sir Thomas Dale,
Knight, late Deputy Governor, be placed as tennants on the said
Companies Lands. And we will and ordain that all the said tennants on
the Governors and Companies Lands shall occupy the same to the half part
of the profits of the said lands, so as the one half to be and belong to
the said tennants themselves and the other half respectively to the said
Governor and to us, the said Treasurer and Company and our successors.
And we further will and ordain that of the half profits arising out of
the said Companies Lands and belonging to us, the said Treasurer and
Company, the one moiety be imploied for the entertainment of the said
Councel of Estate there residing and of other public officers of the
general Colony and plantation (besides the Governor), according to the
proportion as hereafter we shall express and in the mean time as you in
your discretions shall think meet. And the other moiety be carefully
gathered, kept and shipped for England for the public use of us, the
said Treasurer and Company and our successors. And we will and ordain
that, out of the half profits of the said Companies Lands to us
belonging, one fifth part be deducted and alotted for the wages of the
bailiffs and other officers which shall have the oversight and goverment
of the said tenants and lands, and the dividing, gathering, keeping or
shiping of the particular moiety of the profits belonging either to the
said Council and officer there or to us, the said Treasurer and Company
and our successors, as aforesaid. Provided alwaies, that out of the said
Companies Land a sufficient part be exempted and reserved for the
securing and wintering of all sorts of cattle which are or shall be the
public stock and store of the said Company. And forasmuch as our intent
is to establish one equal [blank of several lines][23] plantations,
whereof we shall speak afterwards, be reduced into four cities or
burroughs, namely: the cheif city called James town, Charles City,
Henrico, and the Burrough of Kiccowtan. And that in all these foresaid
cities or burroughs and ancient adventurers and planters which [were]
transported thither, with intent to inhabit at their own costs and
charges, before the coming away of Sir Thomas Dale, Knight, and have so
continued during the space of three years, shall have upon a first
division, to be afterward by us augmented, one hundred acres of land for
their personal adventure and as much for every single share of twelve
pound ten shillings paid [for such share], allotted and set out to be
held by them, their heirs and assigns, forever. And that for all such
planters as were brought thither at the Companies charge to inhabit
there, before the coming away of the said Sir Thomas Dale, after the
time of their service to the Company on the common Land agreed shall be
expired, there be set out one hundred acres of land for each of their
personal adventurers to be held by them, their heirs and assigns, for
ever; paying for every fifty acres the yearly free rent of one shilling
to the said Treasurer and Company and their successors, at one entire
payment on the feast day of St Michael the Archangel, for ever. And in
regard that by the singular industry and virtue of the said Sir Thomas
Dale the former difficulties and dangers were in greatest part overcome
to the great ease and security of such as have been since that time
transported thither, we do, therefore, hereby ordain that all such
persons as sithence the coming away of the said Sir Thomas Dale have at
their own charges been transported thither to inhabit, and so continued
as aforesaid, there be allotted and set out upon a first division fifty
acres of land to them and their heirs, for ever, for their personal
adventure, paying a free rent of one shilling yearly in manner
aforesaid.

    [Footnote 22: Editorial insertion by Kingsbury.]

    [Footnote 23: Editorial note by Kingsbury.]

And that all persons which since the going away of the said Sir Thomas
Dale have been transported thither at the Companies charges, or which
hereafter shall be so transported, be placed as tenants on the Companies
lands for term of seven years, occupy the same to the half part of the
profits as is abovesaid. We therefore will and ordain that other three
thousand acres of land be set out in the fields and territory of Charles
City; and other three thousand acres of land in the fields and
territories of Henrico; and other three thousand acres of land in the
fields and territory of Kiccowtan, all which to be and be called the
Companies Lands and to be occupied by the Companies tenants for half
profits as afore said. And that the profits belonging to the Company be
disposed by their several moieties in the same manner as before set down
touching the Companies lands in the territory of James Town with like
allowance to the bailies and reservation of ground for the common store
of cattle in those several places, as is there set down. And our will is
that such of the Companies tenants as already inhabite in those several
cities or burroughs be not removed to any other city or burrough but
placed on the Companies Lands belonging to those cities or burroughs
where they now inhabite; provided alwaies, that if any private person,
without fraud or injurious intent to the public at his own charges, have
freed any of the said lands formerly appointed to the Governor, he may
continue and inhabite there till a valuable recompence be made him for
his said charges. And we do hereby ordain that the Governors house in
James town, first built by Sir Thomas Gates, Knight, at the charges and
by the servants of the Company, and since enlarged by others by the very
same means, be and continue for ever the Governors house, any pretended
undue grant made by misinformation and not in a general and quarter
court to the contrary in anywise notwithstanding. And to the intent that
godly, learned and painful ministers may be placed there for the service
of Almighty God & for the spiritual benefit and comfort of the people,
we further will and ordain that in every of those cities or burroughs
the several quantity of one hundred acres of land be set out in quality
of glebe land toward the maintenance of the several ministers of the
parishes to be there limited; and for a further supply of their
maintenance there be raised a yearly standing and certain contribution
out of the profits growing or renuing within the several farmes of the
said parish; and so as to make the living of every minister, two hundred
pounds sterling per annum or more as hereafter there shall be cause. And
for a further ease to the inhabitants of all taxes and contributions for
the support and entertainment of the particular magistrates and officers
and of other charges to the said citys and burroughs, respectively
belonging, we likewise will and ordain that within the precincts or
territories of the said cities and burroughs shall be set out and
alotted the several quantities of fifteen hundred acres of land to be
the common land of the said citie or burrough, for the uses aforesaid,
and to be known and called by the name of the Cities or Burroughs Land.
And whereas, by a special grant and licence from His Majesty, a general
contribution over this realm hath been made for the building and
planting of a college for the training up of the children of those
infidels in true religion, moral virtue and civility, and for other
godly uses, we do, therefore, according to a former grant and order,
hereby ratifie, confirm and ordain that a convenient place be chosen and
set out for the planting of a university at the said Henrico in time to
come and that in the mean time preparation be there made for the
building of the said college for the children of the infidels, according
to such instructions as we shall deliver; and we will and ordain that
ten thousand acres, partly of the lands they impaled and partly of other
land within the territory of the said Henrico, be alotted and set out
for the endowing of the said university and college with convenient
possessions. Whereas also we have heretofore, by order of court in
consideration of the long, good and faithful service done by you,
Captain George Yeardley, in our said Colony and plantation of Virginia,
and in reward there of as also in regard of two single shares in money
paid into our treasury, granted unto you, the said Captain Yeardley, all
that parcel of marsh ground called Weynock and also one other peice and
percel of land adjoining to the same marsh called by the Natives
_Konwan_, one parcel whereof abutteth upon a creek there called Mapscock
towards the east, and the other parcel thereof towards a creek there
called Queens Creek on the west and extendeth in breadth to landward
from the head of the said creek called Mapscock up to the head of the
said creek called Queens Creek (which creek called Queens Creek is
opposite to that point there which is now called the Tobacco point and
abutteth south upon the River and north to the Landward), all which
several lands are or shall be henceforward accounted to be lying within
the territory of the said Charles City and exceed not the quantity of
two thousand and two hundred acres, we therefore, the said Treasurer and
Company, do hereby again grant, ratifie and confirm unto you, the said
Captain George Yeardley, the said several grounds and lands; to have and
to hold the said grounds and lands to you, the said Captain George
Yeardley, your heirs and assigns, for ever. And for the better
encouragement of all sorts of necessary and laudable trades to be set up
and exercised within the said four cities burroughs, we do hereby ordain
that if any artizans or trademen shall be desirous rather to follow his
particular art or trade then to be imploied in husbandry or other rural
business, it shall be lawful for you, the said Governor and Councel, to
alot and set out within any of the precincts aforesaid one dwelling
house with four acres of land adjoining and held in fee simple to every
said tradsman, his heirs and assigns for ever, upon condition that the
said tradesman, his heirs and assigns do continue and exercise his trade
in the said house paying only a free rent of four pence by the year to
us, the said Treasurer and Company and our successors, at the feast of
St Michael the Archangel, for ever. And touching all other particular
plantations set out or like to be set out in convenient multitudes,
either by divers of the ancient adventurers associating themselves
together (as the Society of Smiths Hundred and Martins Hundred) or by
some ancient adventurer or planter associating others unto him (as the
plantation of Captain Samuel Argall and Captain John Martin and that by
the late Lord La Warre advanced) or by some new adventurers joining
themselves under one head (as the plantation of Christopher Lawne,
Gentleman, and others now in providing), our intent being according to
the rules of justice and good government to alot unto every one his due
yet so as neither to breed disturbance to the right of others nor to
interrupt the good form of government intended for the benefit of the
people and strength of the Colony; we do therefore will and ordain that
of the said particular plantations none be placed within five miles of
the said former cities and boroughs, and that if any man, out of his own
presumption or pleasure without special direction from us, hath
heretofore done otherwise a convenient time be assigned him and then by
your discretions to remove to some farther place by themselves, to be
chosen with the allowance and assent of the Governor for the time being
and the Council of Estate; and that the inhabitants of the said city or
burrough too near unto which he or they were placed make him and them a
valuable recompense for their charges and expence of time in freeing of
grounds and building within those precincts; in like sort, we ordain
that no latter particular plantation shall at any time hereafter be
seated within ten miles of a former; we also will and ordain that no
particular plantation be or shall be placed straglingly in divers places
to the weakening of them, but be united together in one seat and
territory that so also they may be incorporated by us into one body
corporate and live under equal and like law and orders with the rest of
the Colony; we will and ordain also for the preventing of all fraud in
abusing of our grants, contrary to the intent and just meaning of them,
that all such person or persons as have procured or hereafter shall
procure grants from us in general words unto themselves and their
associates or to like effect shall within one year after the date hereof
deliver up to us in writing, under their hands and seals, as also unto
you, the said Governor and Councel, what be or were the names of those
their first associates; and if they be of the adventurers of us, the
Company which have paid into our treasury money for their shares, that
then they express in that their writing for how many shares they join in
the said particular plantation, to the end a due proportion of land may
be set out unto them and we the said Treasurer and Company be not
defrauded of our due; and if they be not of the adventurers of the
Company which have paid into our treasury money for their shares, yet
are gone to inhabit there and so continue for three years, there be
allotted and set out fifty acres of land for every such person paying a
free rent of twelve pence the year, in manner aforesaid, and all such
persons having been planted there since the coming away of Sir Thomas
Dale; and forasmuch as we understand that certain persons, having
procured such grants in general words to themselves and their associates
or to like effect, have corruptly of late endeavoured for gain and worse
respects to draw many of the ancient planters of the said four cities or
burroughs to take grants also of them and thereby to become associated
unto them with intent also by such means to overstrengthen their party;
and thereupon have adventured on divers enormous courses tending to the
great hurt and hindrance of the Colony; yea, and have also made grants
of like association to masters of ships and mariners never intending
there to inhabit, thereby to defraud His Majesty of the customs due unto
him; we, to remedy and prevent such unlawful and greedy courses tending
also directly to faction and sedition, do hereby ordain that it shall
not be lawful for the grantees of such grants to associate to any other
unto them then such as were their associates from the first time of the
said grants, without express licence of us, the said Treasurer and
Company, in a great general and quarter court under our seal obtained;
and that all such after or under grants of association made or to be
made by the said grantees shall be to all intents and purposes utterly
void. And for as much as we understand that divers particular persons
(not members of our Company), with their companies, have provided or are
in providing to remove into Virginia with intent (as appeareth) by way
of association to shroud themselves under the general grants last
aforesaid, which may tend to the great disorder of our Colony and
hinderance of the good government which we desire to establish, we do
therefore hereby ordain that all such persons as of their own voluntary
will and authority shall remove into Virginia, without any grant from us
in a great general and quarter court in writing under our seal, shall be
deemed (as they are) to be occupiers of our land, that is to say, of the
common lands of us, the said Treasurer and Company; and shall yearly pay
unto us for the said occupying of our land one full fourth part of the
profits thereof till such time as the same shall be granted unto them by
us in manner aforesaid, and touching all such as being members of our
Company and adventurers by their monies paid into our treasury, shall
either in their own person or by their agents, tennants or servants set
up in Virginia any such particular plantation, tho with the privity of
us, the said Treasurer and Company, yet without any grant in writing
made in our said general quarter courts as is requisite, we will and
ordain that the said adventurers or planters shall, within two year
after the arrival of them or their company in Virginia, procure our
grant in writing to be made, in our general quarter court and under our
seal, of the lands by them possessed or occupied, or from thenceforth
shall be deemed only occupiers of the common land, as is aforesaid, till
such times as our said grant shall be obtained. We also not more
intending the reformation of the errors of the said     [24] than for
advancing of them into good courses and therein to assist them by all
good means, we further hereby ordain that to all such of the said
particular [24] as shall truly fully observe the orders afore and
hereafter specified there be alotted and set out, over and above our
former grants, one hundred acres of glebe land for the Minister of every
[24] and fifteen hundred acres of burough land for the public use of the
said plantation; not intending yet hereby either to abridge or enlarge
such grant of glebe or common land as shall be made in any of our grants
in writing to any of the said particular plantations; we also will and
ordain that the like proportion of maintenance out of the     [24] and
profits of the earth be made for the several ministers of the said
particular plantations as have been before set down for the Ministers of
the said former cities and burroughs; we will and ordain that the
Governor for the time being and the said Council of Estate do justly
perform or cause to be performed all such grants, covenants and articles
as have or shall be in writing in our great and general quarter courts
to any of the said particular plantations, declaring all other grants of
lands in Virginia, not made in one of our great and general quarter
courts, by force of His Majesties letters patents to be void. And to the
end aforesaid we will and ordain that all our grants in writing under
our seal, made in our great and general quarter courts, be entered into
your records to be kept there in Virginia; yet directly forbiding that a
charter of land granted to Captain Samuel Argal and his associates,
bearing date the twentieth of March, 1616, be entered in your records or
otherwise at all respected, forasmuch as the same was obtained by slight
and cunning; and afterwards upon suffering him to go Governor of
Virginia was by his own voluntary act left in our custody to be
cancelled upon grant of a new charter which     [24] We do also hereby
declare that heretofore in one of our said general and quarter courts we
have ordained and enacted and in this present court have ratified and
confirmed these orders and laws following: that all grants of lands,
privileges and liberties in Virginia hereafter to be made, be passed by
indenture, a counterpart whereof to be sealed by the grantees and to be
kept     [25] the Companies     [25] evidences; and that the Secretary of
the Company have the engrossing of all such indentures; that no patents
or indentures of grants of land in Virginia be made and sealed but in a
full, general and quarter court, the same having been first thoroughly
perused and approved under the hands of a select committee for that
purpose     [25] that all grants of     [25] in Virginia to such
adventurers as have heretofore brought in their money here to the
treasury for their several shares, being of twelve pounds ten shillings
the share, be of one hundred acres the share upon the first division and
of as many more upon a second division, when the land of the first
division shall be sufficiently peopled; and for every person which they
shall transport thither within seven years after Midsummer Day, one
thousand six hundred and eighteen, if he continue there three years or
dye in the mean time after he is shiped it be of fifty acres the person
upon the first division and fifty more upon a second division, the land
of the first being sufficiently peopled, without paying any rent to the
Company for the one or the other; and that in all such grants the names
of the said adventurers and the several number of each of their shares
be expressed; provided alwaies, and it is ordained, that if the said
adventurers or any of them do not truly and effectually, with one year
next after the sealing of the said grant, pay and discharge all such
sums of money wherein by subscription (or otherwise upon notice thereof
given from the auditors) they stand indebted to the Company, or if the
said adventurers, or any of them having not lawful right, either by
purchase from the Company or by assignment from some other former
adventurers, within one year after the said grant or by special gift of
the Company upon merit preceding in a full quarter court, to so many
shares as he or they pretend, do not within one year after the said
grant, satisfie and pay to the said Treasurer and Company for every
share so wanting after the rate of twelve pounds ten shillings the
share, that then the said grant for so much as concerneth the     [25]
part and all the shares of the said person so behind and not satisfying
as aforesaid shall be utterly void; provided also, and it is ordained,
that the grantees shall from time to time during the said seven years
make a true certificate to the said Treasurer, Councel and Company from
the chief officer or officers of the places respectively, of the number,
names, ages, sex, trades and conditions of every such person so
transported or shiped, to be entered by the Secretary into a register
book for that purpose to be made; that for all persons not comprised in
the order next before which during the next seven years after Midsummer
day, 1618, shall go into Virginia with intent there to inhabite, if they
continue there three years or dye after they are shiped there shall be a
grant made of fifty acres for every person upon a first division and as
many more upon a second division (the first being peopled), which grants
to be made respectively to such persons and their heirs at whose charges
the said persons going to inhabite in Virginia shall be transported with
reservation of twelve pence yearly rent for every fifty acres to be
answered to the said Treasurer and Company and their successors for
ever, after the first seven years of every such grant; in which grants a
provisoe to be inserted that the grantees shall from time to time during
the said seven years make a true certificate to the said Treasurer,
Councel and Company, from the chief officer or officers of places
respectively, of the number, names, ages, sex, trades and conditions of
every such person so transported or shiped, to be entred by the
Secretary into a register book for that purpose to be made; that all
grants as well of one sort as the other respectively be made with equal
favours, and grants of like liberties and immunities as near as may be
to the end that all complaint of partiality [or] differencie may be
prevented. All which said orders we hereby will and ordain to be firmly
and unvoilably kept and observed and that the inhabitants of Virginia
have notice of them for their use and benefit. Lastly, we do hereby
require and authorize you, the said Captain George Yeardley and the said
Council of Etats, associating with you such other as you shall there
find meet, to survey or cause to be survey'd all the lands and
territories in Virginia above mentioned and the same to set out by
bounds and metes, especially so as that the territories of the said
several cities and buroughs and other particular plantations may be
conveniently divided and known the one from the other; each survey to be
set down distinctly in writing and returned to us under your hands and
seals. In witness whereof we have hereunto set our common seal, given in
a great and general court of the Council and Company of Adventurers of
Virginia held the eighteenth day of November, 1618; and in the years of
the reign of our soverain Lord James, by the grace of God, King of
England, Scotland, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, &c., Vizt.
of England, France and Ireland the sixteenth and of Scotland the two and
fiftieth. Novr. 18, 1618.

JULY 24, 1621


Instructions to the Governor for the time being and Counsell of State in
Virginia:

1. First wee requier you in gennerall take into spetiall regard and
estimation the service of Almightie God and observance of his divine
lawes and that the people in Virginia bee trained up in true religion,
god lives and vertue, that ther example may be a meanes to winn the
infidells to God: wherin wee pray you especiallie to have in daly
rememberance that the patterne which you shall give in your owne persons
& in your families wilbee of singular and chief moment whatt may soever
itt shall propend. And since our gennerall endeavours and designes have
nott yett effected a due establishment of the honor and rights
belonginge to the Church and ministerie, wee must requier your most
earnest care to advance all things appertayninge thereunto, seriously
endeavoring the establishment of due order in administringe of all
services according to the usuall forme and discipline of the Church of
England and carefullie avoidinge all factious and needlesse novelties
tending onlie to the disturbance of peace and unitie; and that such
ministers as have been or shalbe sent from time to time may bee
respected and mainteined according to the orders made in that behalfe,
also for accomodatinge the churches or places for divine service.

2. Wee praie you likewise take care, that the people now ther or
hereafter inhabitinge bee kept in due obedience to His Majestie and that
they all take the oaths of supremacie and allegiance; and that you
provide that justice bee equallie administered to all His Majesties
subjects ther resideing, and as neare as may be after the forme of this
realme of England, wherin you are to have a vigilant care to prevent
corruption amongst your inferior officers tending to the perverting or
delaying of justice; wee praie you also to have espetiall care that no
injurie or oppresion bee wrought by the English against any of the
natives of that countrie wherby the present peace may be disturbed and
ancient quarrells (now buried) might be revived; provided, nevertheles,
that the honor of our nation and safety of our people bee still
preserved and all maner of insolence committed by the natives be
severely and sharpelie punished.

3. Item: that you cause our people to applie themselves to an
industrious course of life in followeinge ther buissinesies, each in the
several degre and proffession, and that no man bee suffered to live
idly, the example wherof might prove pernicious to the rest; in
perticular that you bee carefull now in the begining to suppresse too
much gaming and above all things that odious vice of drunkenes; and that
all kinde of riott both in apparrell & otherwise bee eschewed; and that
an edict bee speedily published that no person residing in Virginia
(excepting those of the Counsill and heads of hundreds and plantations,
ther wives & chilldren) shall weare any gold in ther clothes or any
apparrell of silke, untill such time they have itt of the silke ther
made by silkewormes & raised by ther owne industry.

4. Item: that you use good prudence that no just cause of offence bee
given to any other prince, state or people which are in league or amitie
with His Majestie; and that no captaine or other of our Colonie under
pretence of trade to the coast of the West Indies bee suffred to saile
out with anie vessell ther to robb & spoile wherby to provoke any other
nation against us; and that no piratts have cause by ... accesse to
retier with ther purchasses to the coast of Virginia, but that they be
severlie punnished & ther goods confiscated: for the preventing of
which, as alsoe for securing your selves against all forraigne ennimies,
wee require your serious considerations for the speedie errecting of
fortresses or blockhouses at the mouth of the river as also for all
other manner of needfull fortifications in all places, and to the
effecting hereof wee requirer you, as well private persons as hundreds
and corporations, bee ratablie proportioned to the performance of
certaine dayes worke by the yeare.

5. Item: that the best meanes bee used to draw the better disposed of
the natives to converse with our people and labor amongst them with
convenient reward that therby they may growe to a likeing and love of
civility and finallie bee brought to the knowledge and love of God and
true religion, which may prove also of great strength to our people
against the savages or other invadors, whatsoever; and they may bee fitt
instruments to assist afterwards in the more gennerall conversion of the
heathen people which wee somuch desier.

6. Item: that for the laying of the surer foundation for the said
conversion, that each towne, cittie, burrough and other particular
plantation bee procured to obtaine to themselves by just meanes a
certaine number of the chilldren of the natives to be educated by them
in true religion and a civill course of life; of which chilldren the
most towardlie boyes in will and graces of nature to bee brought up by
them in the first elements of literature so to bee fitted for the
colledge, in the fabricke whereof we purpose to proceed assoone as any
proffit returned from the tenantes shall enhable us; and doe therfore
verie ernestlie requier your uttermost helps aswell for the improveinge
of ther labors, as for the true account and returne of the proffitts
already due, that so that busines of the colledge may goe forward with
which wee doubt not a particular blessing of God will goe a long uppon
the Collony ther as wee are assured the love of all good men here to the
plantation will therby be encreased.

7. Item: that imediatlie after the gatheringe in of the present yeares
cropp by Sir George Yeardlie, wee requier that the land belonging to the
place of Governor bee resigned to Sir Francis Wyate and that ther bee
delivered to him by Sir George Yeardly the hundred tenants well
furnished which wee sent him for the place; and if ther bee any of them
wanting, Sir George Yeardly is out of his private to make good the full
nomber of a hundred, which wee hope hee will gladlie doe, remembringe
our courtesie in the addition of thirtie able persons sent him the
former springe to supplie those that wee understood through mortallitie
had failed; as also our refusing to accept of his offer to depart
[part?] with all the proffitt by the Governors land or tenants, onlie
exspecting his care to cultivate well that land and to uphold that
nomber of a hundred tenants for the place.

8. Item: imediatelie upon the expiracion of Sir George Yeardlys
goverment on the eighteenth of November next, you shall admitt Sir
Francis Wiats commission to bee read, whom accordinglie you shall
receave and publish Governor and Captaine Generall, yealding unto his
person and place all our respect, honor and observance.

9. Item: the comission for establishing of the Counsell you shall
publish uppon the deliverie therof and as speedylie as convenientlie you
may to administer the oath of Counsellors unto the severall persons
therin named.

10. And forasmuch as ther hath ben in theise late yeares great fault or
defect in nott putting in execucion our orders of court and Counsell for
the setting upp & upholdinge those staple comodities which are
necessarie for the subsisting and encrease of the plantation, which hath
happned in part by the our chargeing the Governor with toe much
buissnes, wee have uppon espetiall approvement of the industry and

him to bee Treasurer in Virginia, butt also committed to his spetiall
and extreordinarie care the execution of all our orders, charters and
instructions tending to the setting upp, encrease and maintaininge of
the said staple comodities); wee, therefore, requier you that upon all
such occationes wherin the said master ... shall have occation to bee
employed, you give him all such countenance, help and power in the
execution therof as you would doe to the Governor himselfe if hee were
personallie present; and that provition bee made for convenient
transporting him from place upon all those occations; we have by order

11. Item: wee pray you likewise with convenient speed to reveive the
commissiones formerlie directed to Sir George Yeardly, then Governor,
and to the Counsell of State ther beareinge date the 18 of November,
1618, conteining the lawes & orders for dividing the citties and

for the well settling of that State. And haveing sent you coppies of all
such instructions, letters, charters & directions as have here before
been sent from time to time, wee pray you to peruse them all and what
soever you shall find not contrarie to any of theise instructions and

likewise of the mariages and christnings hapninge with that place; and
that the personall goods and estate of the partie deceased bee

that a list bee kept of the nomber of all sorts of cattell in each
particular burrough or plantation; and that you cause the Secretarie
once everie yeare to returne us hether a perfect coppie of all the
premisses.

13. Item: that whereas the principall hope of the plantacion dependes
much on the prosperity of particular Colonies or hundreds, itt wilbe
verie necessarie that in case of the death or other misaccidents of the
chief heads of those Colonies, you take into your carefull regaurd the
conservation of the bodie and sinews of that plantation united,
preserving the remaines by the best meanes that either industry or
charity can effect.

14. Item: that according to His Majesties gratious advise and the desire
& expectacion of the whole state here, you draw the people from the
excessive planting of tobacco and that, according to a late order of
court in that behalfe made the thirteenth of June last, you suffer them
not to plaint in one yeare alone one hundred waight tobacco the head,
that is the person; and that you do provide by some generall course to
bee held amongst them that they apply themselves to the soweing and
planting of corne in good plentie that ther may bee alwaies a large
proportion not onlie for their owne use, but store also for such as in
great multitudes wee hope yearly to send; likewise by the same generall
course to cause the generall inhabitants and households to enclose by
pale & strong fences some fitting portion of our land for the keping of
cowes, tame swine and poultrie; and for the making all due provitiones
for the encrease & preservation of the bread of all sorts of cattle, and
in particular kine, wherof wee thinke itt most unfitt that any should
bee as yett killed and requier your vigilent care for the inhibiting
thereof.

15. Item: after corne, wee comend unto your care the matter of silke
which his Majesty heretofore espetially to commended unto us and out of
his owne store hath moste gratiouslie been pleased often to furnish our
Company with seed: in supply of which more hath bin since sent and a
greater quantitie shall likewise followe hereafter as soone as itt shall
come to our hands. Wee requier therfore that you cause in everie
particular plantation great nomber of mulbery trees to bee plainted
neare ther dwellings, and such as are already groweing to bee preserved
for planting, of which many excellent bookes have binn already sent in
December last, unto which wee referr you for your better direction
therin, as also to divers French and other experienced men, late sent &
procured at extraordinarie charge, of whose generall subsistence wee
expect your assidious care.

16. Item: silke grasse, being a comoditie of spetiall hope and much use,
not with standing through negligence and want of experience, it hath
lately been declared to bee full of difficullty and hazard both in
groweing and curing, yett we doe especially recomend unto your care and
that you direct some good way to bring it to perfection by experimenting
the soiles, the seasons and true maner of cultivating of itt, being
confident that that which growes so naturally in those parts will much
more by art and industry bee at lenght brought to perfection, and being
many wayes so usefull will bring great honor an [and?] proffitt unto the
action.

17. Item: wee doe also especially recommend unto you the planting of
vines in aboundance and that the vignerons sent with so great charge to
the Company bee fairely & carefullie provided for.

18. Item: wee requier also that all sorts of artsmen be employed in ther
severall trades and that store of aprentizes bee placed & held to learne
ther occupations, especially those that are most usefull or most
comodious; and that you duely consider the quallities and trades of all
those people sent over for the Companies or any of the Collonies servis
& that you cause them to bee held to ther trades and occupations wherin
ther are like to deserve & win most bennifitt; and not to suffer them to
forsake ther former occupacions for planting tobacco or such uselesse
comodities. And here wee earnestly commend unto your care the Dutchemen
sent for the erecting of sawing mills, a worke most necessarie since the
materialls for howsing and shipping can not otherwise without much more
troble, paines and charge bee provided; & although wee have received
some notice that fitting places for ther works and not ther easilie
found out, yett wee hope that dillegence fitting to bee used in a case
of so generall benifitt hath discoverid how to make use of ther skills
by this time. Nor doe wee here apprehend any difficullty of finding
accomodation for that purpose about the falls or towards the heads of
some river or brookes by the station, wherof timber may be brought unto
them verie easili and by the current of the river the plankes or boords
sawen may bee transported for the generall use of all or the greatest
part of our people.

19. Item: that your corne mills bee presentlie erected and pupliqe
bakehowses in everie burrough bee built with all speed and dilligence.

20. Item: that all apparent or proved contracts made in England or in
Virginia betweene the owners of land in Virginia and ther tenants or
servants be truly performed and the breach of them reformed by due
punishment as justice shall requier.

21. Item: that you suffer no crafty or advantageous meanes to bee used
to entice a way the tenants or servants of any particular plantacion
from the place they are ... ceited and that all offenders herein bee
severlie punished and the partie drawne away bee returned to ther former
place.

[22]. Wee commend unto your especiall regard the providing for such
persons as have already bin sent or are now or shall be hereafter
entertained for the erecting of iron works; that all possible meanes bee
used for ther encouradgment & for the performing of generall contracts
here made with the Company wherby justice unto them and profitt to the
plantation may arise. And whereas Mr. John Berkly hath bin approved unto
us here by extreordinary recommendations to bee industrious and
intelligent gentleman many ways, butt espetially for iron works, wee
desier hee & his company may bee cherished by you and supported by the
helpe of the whole Colonie if need shall requier, therby to enhable him
to perfect that worke wherupon the Company have already expended great
somes of money & itt is a com[modity] so necessarie as few other are to
bee valewed in comparrison therof. Upon the successe therof also, mens
eyes are generally fixed & therfore if itt should now (as by former
misaccident or negligence) fall to the ground, ther were little hope
that ever they would bee revived againe; and whereas wee have bin so
circomspect as to contraict with many masters severally for the erecting
of the said works, wherby wee hoped though some miscarried or failled
others should have proceeded; if by want of workes or necessarie
materialls the said masters cannot for present bee seatted or enjoy the
conditions of ther contraicts, wee thinke fitt you should accomodate
them according to ther several habillities in some secondarie or
subordinarie places of assistance to Mr. Berkly, or when another worke
may be advanced to worke them over that, according (as neere as may bee)
to ther contraictes made here with the Company, wherby this worke of so
great consequence & generall expectacion, infinitt com[modity] &
unspeakeable benifitt to the plantacion may bee dilligentlie prosecuted
& upheld.

23. Item: salt, pich and tarr, soape ashes, &c., often recommended and
sett up, and for which fittinge men & matterialles have been sent to the
great charge of the Company and yett daylie complaints come to us of the
want of them, wee desier you will now prosecute and further with all
dilligence & care.

24. Item: your makeing of oile of wallnuts, your employing your
apothecaries in distilling of hott waters out of your lees of beere and
searching after minierall dyes, gummes, druggs, and the like things, wee
desier you not to forgett and good quanteties of all sorts to send us by
all shipps.

25. Item: since wee have conceaved itt most fitting to ordaine that a
small quantety of tobacco shall bee plainted or cherished in Virginia,
wee hold itt verie necessarie to use all possible care that the
proporcion limmitted may bee improved in goodnes as much as may bee; and
therefore that some good order bee taken to see itt well cured and duely
ordred that bringing itt into request may cause any certaine benifitt to
the planters.

26. Item: that due proceeding bee used in the erection of those howses
appointed for lodgeing of new men upon ther landing, according to former
directions; and that from time to time a course bee taken for ther
repaire, cleane & neat; keeping likewise, for comon store, howses in
convenient places as well for other needs necessary provitions, as upper
roomes for conservation of a proportion of gounpouder ready for use.

27. Item: whereas wee have many times found losse & interuption in our
buissines through want of frequent relacion from Virginia, wee therefore
requier you att least to make a quarterly dispatch unto us, the
duplicate wherof to bee duely sentt by the next oppertunitie of shipping
after.

28. Item: whereas Capt. William Norton and certaine Itallians, now by
the general Company and other worthy minded adventures att a verie great
charge, sent for the erecting of a glasse furnace in Virginia, wee
hartilie desire you to afford them all favor possible. And in particular
that the guesthowses built by Leftenant Whitakers bee allowed them for
ther habitacion till they may convenientlie provide themselves of ther
owne; and that all orders given them from hence bee exactlie putt in
execucion.

29. Item: a gentleman's great dilligence in our affaires, accompaned
with extreordinarie capacity and judgement, haveing proceeded the
treatise of the buissnes belonging to the plantacion, approved by us to
bee full of exellent observances for those that are emmenly employd in
Virginia, as well for us here, wee sent a coppy to ly amongst the
records of your Counsell from whence, from the often veiw of former
passadgs, wee wish every Counsellor may make permanent instructions, and
no doubt much helps and furtherance may bee produced in most occasiones
for the advancement of the plantacion.

30. Item: that ther be espetiall care taken both of generall and
particular survaies wherby not onlie a true mapp and face of the whole
country, costs, creeks, rivers, highe ground & lowe ground, &c., may bee
exactlie discoverid, but also the boundaries of the severall hundreds
and plantacions, with the perticuler directions in them bee perfectlie
sett forth from time to time, mainetained to prevent therby future
differences that arise upon questions of possestion, wherin also itt may
be fitting and moste usefull to posteritie to cast an imaginarie eye and
view, wher and which way the grand highewayes may bee like to strike and
passe through the dominions; in which course the hard mountaines, the
fords, the places for bridges, &c., may nott unfittlie bee considered;
for performance of all which the premises (and for the better
sattisfaction) of the planters, whoe have so often required ther lands
may bee devided and bounded, wee have now sent and furnished out Mr.
William Cleyburne, gentleman, recomended unto us as very [fitt] in the
art of surveying.

31. Item: the oppressing and imoderate fees heretofore exacted in
Virginia by divers officers in valuacion of ther paines & travell for
the Colonies service have partlie occationed the settling a competent
revenue to arrise therby tenants to everie cheif officer; wee now
forbidd that officer so provided for, or otherwise by allotted parts out
of the common profitt recompenced, doe take any other fees for execution
of ther severall places either directly or indirectly; neverthelesse,
that clarks & such like may have a reward for ther dilligence, wee
require you by order to sett downe some small proportion for passes,
warrants, copies of orders, seales, &c., or proportionably to the merits
of servants paines and attendance.

32. Item: the Governor & Counsell assembled within a short time after
the arivall of this shipp are to sett downe the fittest months after
ther quarterlie meeting of the Counsell of State according to the
seasons and to fitting meanes for ther entertayment, together with
regaurd of the best ease and benifitt of the people, that shall have
occasion to addresse themselves unto the Counsell, either for justice or
direction; considering also the times of making ther dispathes to
England, according to the oppertunities of shiping ther comeing or
goeing.

33. That the Governor for the time being in or about the foresaid time
doe summon by an officer appointed for that purpose the Counsell of
State to appeare at a day and to bee together for the space of one whole
month or more if need shall requier to advise & consult upon matter of
Counsell of State and of the generall affaires of the Colonie, and as
ther shalbee cause to order and determine the greater causes of
consequence or such matter as shall growe or arise within the Colonie,
either by reference or judgment; and that free accesse bee permitted to
all suiters to make knowne ther perticuler grevances, bee itt against
what person soever. And if the plaint appeare to bee important, to
record the same ther & to returne a coppy ther of together with the
report of your proceeding therin.

34. As also to keepe a perfect register of all the acts of each quarter
sessions duely and orderlie and therof to returne a perfect transcript
unto us by the first oppertunitie of shipping from time to time. And
that at everie sessions you cause all instructions and charters that are
already or shall hereafter bee sent from hence to bee read and so from
sessions to sessions untill our directory shall bee fullie executed.

35. Item: in case of the Governor death or removall or suspencion by
order from hence untill other direction from us can come, wee requier
that the Counsell or major part of them then residing in Virginia doe
imedialie assemble themselves and within fourteene dayes or sooner from
out of ther body to elect one to supplie the place for the time; and to
preserve the state of bussinesse still in the same current that it was.

36. The relation of which act of Counsell wee will you send us with as
much speede as may bee, and if ther should bee an unexpected division in
the voices of the counsell that a just halfe should bee willing to elect
one and the other halfe desirous of another, then wee will that election
bee made of the Leftennant Governor; and in his absence or necessarie
cause of declining the Marshall, and in case of his default or such
refusall then the Treasurer, then one of the two deputies or the other
till the place of Governor be settled in on [one] of our said cheif
officers.

37. Item: whereas ther hath bin severall directions given to the former
Governor for fixing the tenants uppon the lands as well belonging to the
Governor place as other the officers seated by the Governor, which uppon
pretences hath bin allowed and neglected and the men lett out to the
heir; wee requier you that hereafter no officer bee permitted to lett
out his tenants, butt settle them uppon the lands sett out for his
place, enjoining them to enclose gardens, build howses, deviding them
into families or societies, to place them upon the land appropriated to
his office, excepting onlie the Counsell shall have power to make a
convenient order at one of the quarter sessions to dispence with this
article for the space of six months & that in case onlie of extreeme
necessitie.

38. Item: the Governor, onlie for the time being, shall summon Counsells
and sine warrants & execute or give athoritie for execution of the
Counsells orders, except in cases which seeme to appertaine to the
imediate execucions of Liftenant Generall, Marshall, Tresuror, or
deputies, wherin according to ther severall comissions or by a conceaved
order from a quarter counsell the officers are severallie directed and
authorised.

39. The Governor for the time being shall have absolute power and
authoritie according to the implicacion of his particular commission to
direct, determine and punish at his good discretion any emergent
buissnes, neglect or contempt of authority in any kind or what soever
negligence or contempt may bee found in any person ther residing or
being, except only those of the Counsell for ther on persons whoe are in
such cases to bee summoned to appeare at the next quarter session of the
Counsell holdne ther abide ther censure; in the meane time if the
Governor shall thinke itt may concerne either the quiett of that state
to proceed more speedily with such an offendor, itt shall bee lawful to
summon a Counsell extreordinarie, wherat six of the Counsell at lest are
to bee present with the said Governor and by the main parte of ther
voices committ any Counsellor to saife custody or upon baile to appere
and abide the order of the nextt quarter counsell.

40. Everie order and decree of the Counsell of State shalbe concluded by
the major parte of voices at that Assembly, wherin the Governor for the
time being is to have a casting voice if the nomber of Counsellors
should bee even or should bee equally devided in oppinnion;
neverthelesse reserving to the said Governor a negative voice att any
Generall Assembly according to a former comission granted.[26]

    [Footnote 26: One of the few references to the _Commission_,
    not the "Instructions", to Yeardley, authorizing a General
    Assembly.]

41. Item: wee pray you likewise to take into your care the protexcion of
the people, that they suffer no wrong by the engrossing commodity &
forestalling the marketts, butt preserve them open for all men freely or
indifferently to buy or sell.

42. Item: wee requier you expecially to see the publicke labors to bee
from time to time equally charged & burdned for the people that one mans
tenants bee nott favored above others or officers tenants favored more
then those of the puplique; and to the end those services may fall as
easy to all ports as may bee, wee thinke in the punishment of all
enormus misdemeanors, &c., ill deservers bee condemned to a nomber of
days works for puplique use & building, or to finnishing of a fence or
dike, or to cariage or roweing according to the meritt of the offence.

43. Item: where as the Right Honourable the Earle of Pembroke with
divers his associates have undertaken to plaint thirty thousand acres of
land in Virginia, we therfore intreat you to make choice of the best
seate on that river that is not yett inhabited; and herin to take the
advise of Mr. Leech, whoe now goes over to veiw the cuntrie and to bee
enployd in that plantacion which being sett out wee desier to be
informed therof.

44. Item: as wee hold itt most necessarie that you provide for the
generall safety and securing of your selves and estats together, so doe
wee conceave it a matter of exceeding great advantage & incouragment to
discover everie day farther by the sea coast and within land about which
wee requier you to conceave a fitting course from time espetiallie to
find good fishing betweene James river and Cape Cod or any wher within
our limmittes wherin wee suppose the new trade of commodities found
wilbe like to recompence the troble and charge bestowed therin, for wee
are certainely informed that the Dutchmen within 20 or 30 leagues of
your plantacion steile a trade for furrs, &c., to ther verie great gaine
& content.

45. Item: for as much as planting of staple commodities is useuallie
much advanced by example taken one from another, wee expect that the
cheif officers by ther owne particular employment of ther people & land,
& setting forth the benifitts & hopes of such endeavors, shall
exceedinglie advance the state of commodity and trade.

46. Item: wee doe moreover requier that according to your oaths and
severall charges your thoughts & endeavors be unanimouslie employed for
performance of our instructions in generall, & particuler that chieflie
aiminge at the establishment of the Colonie your selves & all of us that
have endeavorid therein may bee comforted in a happie apparence of
prosperity of the plantacion which wilbe glorious before God and
infinitt honor, strenght & profitt to our King & Cuntry.

47. Lastly wee pray you that no shipp that now or at any time wee shall
send at the companies charge to Virginia bee suffered to stay ther above
thirty dayes for avoiding of charge which hath heretofore grown uppon
long voydges in freight & wages & that you suffer not in the said shipps
any goods provicions sent thither to bee brought from thence againe by
any marriners, passengers or others uppon paine of some punishment to be
inflicted upon them; and although the infancy of the plantacion may nott
some time afford the more valuable comodities to freight the shipps home
uppon so short a stay, yett wee suppose that a prudent course &
preperacion may at last afford them choice timber as clear walnutt or
some other such lesse valueable commodity to add to ther lading which
will yeild more profitt to the Companie with the shipps quicke returne
then is usueally raised by ther best comodities when longer accompt for
freightt hath drawne on a further charge. Given under the Counsell scale
the fower and twentith day of Julie, 1621; and in the yeare of the raign
of our soveraigne Lord James, by the grace of God of England, Scotland,
France and Ireland, Defender of the faith, &c., that is to say of
England, France and Ireland the nineteenth and Scottland the fower and
fiftith.

    heard, the Treasuror, Council and Company of Adventurers and
    Planters of the Citty of London for the First Collony in
    Virginia send greeting: knowe yee that wee, the said

(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
