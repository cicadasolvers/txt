                            THE EPISTLE OF
                       IGNATIUS TO THE EPHESIANS.


CHAPTER I.

     1 Ignatius commends the brethren for sending
     Onesimus and other members of the church to him.
     8 Exhorts them to unity;
     13 by a due subjection to their bishop;

IGNATIUS, who is also called
Theophorus, to the church which
is at Ephesus in Asia; most
deservedly happy: being blessed
through the greatness and fullness
of God the Father, and predestinated
before the world began; that it
should be always unto an enduring
and unchangeable glory; united and
chosen through his true passion,
according to the will of the Father,
and Jesus Christ our God; all
happiness, by Jesus Christ,
and his undefiled grace.

2  I have heard of your name
much beloved in God; which ye
have very justly attained by a
habit of righteousness, according
to the faith and love which is in
Jesus Christ our Saviour.

3  How that being followers of
God, and stirring up yourselves
by the blood of Christ ye have
perfectly accomplished the work
that was con-natural unto you.

4  For hearing that I came bound
from Syria, for the common name
and hope, trusting through your
prayers to fight with beasts at
home; so that by suffering I may
become indeed the disciple of him
who gave himself to God, an offering
and sacrifice for us; ye hastened
to see me. I received, therefore,
in the name of God, your whole
multitude in Onesimus;

5  Who by: inexpressible love is
ours, but according to the flesh
is our bishop; whom I beseech you,
pray Jesus Christ, to love: and that
you would all strive to be like unto
him. And blessed be God, who
has granted unto you, who are so
worthy of him, to enjoy such an
excellent bishop.

6  For what concerns my fellow
servant Burrhus, and your most
blessed deacon in things pertaining
to God; I entreat you that he may
tarry longer, both for yours, and
your bishop's honour.

7  And Crocus also worthy of
both our God and you, whom I
have received as the pattern
of your love, has in all things
refreshed me, as the Father of
our Lord Jesus Christ shall also
refresh him; together with Onesimus,
and Burrhus, and Euplus, and Fronto,
in whom I have, as to your charity,
seen all of you, And may always,
have joy of you, if I shall be
worthy of it.

8  It is therefore fitting that you
should by all means glorify Jesus
Christ, who hath glorified you
that by a uniform obedience ye
may be perfectly joined together
in the same mind, and in the same
judgment; and may all speak the
same things concerning everything:

9  And that being, subject to
your bishop, and the presbytery,
ye may be wholly and thoroughly
sanctified.

10  These things I prescribe to
you, not as if I were somebody
extraordinary: for though I am
bound for his name, I am not yet
perfect in Christ Jesus. But now
I begin to learn, and I speak to
you as fellow disciples together
with me.

11  For I ought to have been
stirred up by you, in faith: in
admonition; in patience; in long-
suffering; but forasmuch as
charity suffers me not to be
silent towards you, I have first
taken upon me to exhort you, that
ye would all run together,
according to the will of God.

12  For even Jesus Christ, our
inseparable life, is sent by the
will of the Father; as the bishops,
appointed unto the utmost bounds of
the earth, are by the will of Jesus
Christ.

13  Wherefore it will become you
to run together according to the
will of your bishop, as also ye do,

14  For your famous presbytery,
worthy of God, is fitted as exactly
to the bishop, as the strings are
to the harp.

15  Therefore in your concord
and agreeing charity, Jesus Christ
is sung; and every single person
among you makes up the chorus:

16  That so being all consonant
in love, and taking up the song
of God, ye may in a perfect unity
with one voice, sing to the Father
by Jesus Christ; to the end that
he may both hear you, and perceive
by your works, that ye are indeed
the members of his son.

17  Wherefore it is profitable for
you to live in an unblameable
unity, that so ye may always have
a fellowship with God.



CHAPTER II.

     1 The benefit of subjection.
     4 The bishop not to be respected the less
     because he is not forward in exacting it:
     8 warns brethren against heretics; bidding
     them cleave to Jesus, whose divine and human
     mature is declared: commends them for their care
     to keep themselves from false teachers:
     and shews them the way to God.

FOR if I in this little time have
had such a familiarity with
your bishop, I mean not a carnal,
but spiritual acquaintance with
him; how much more must I think
you happy who are so joined to him,
as the church is to Jesus Christ,
and Jesus Christ to the Father;
so that all things may agree in
the same unity.

2  Let no man deceive himself;
if a man be not within the altar,
he is deprived of the bread of God.
For if the prayer of one or two
be of such force, as we are told;
how much more powerful shall
that of the bishop and the whole
church be?

3  He therefore that does not
come together in the same place
with it, is proud, and has already
condemned himself; for it is written,
God resisteth the proud. Let us take
heed therefore, that we do not set
ourselves against the bishop,
that we may be subject to God.

4  The more any one sees his
bishop silent, the more let him
revere him.    For whomsoever the
master of the house sends to be
over his own household, we ought
in like manner to receive him, as
we do him that sent him. It is
therefore evident that we ought
to look upon the bishop, even as
we do upon the Lord himself.

5  And indeed Onesimus himself
does greatly commend your good
order in God: that you all live
according to the truth, and that
no heresy dwells among you. For
neither do ye hearken to anyone
more than to Jesus Christ
speaking to you in truth.

6  For some there are who
carry about the name of Christ
in deceitfulness, but do things
unworthy of God; whom ye must
flee, as ye would do so many
wild beasts. For they are raving
dogs, who bite secretly; against
whom ye must guard yourselves,
as men hardly to be cured.

7  There is one Physician, both
fleshy and spiritual; made and
not made; God incarnate; true
life in death; both of Mary and
of God: first passible, then
impassible; even Jesus Christ our
Lord.

8  Wherefore let no man deceive
you; as indeed neither are ye
deceived, being wholly the
servants of God. For inasmuch as
there is no contention nor strife
among you, to trouble you, ye
must needs live according to God's
will. My soul be for yours;
and I myself, the expiatory
offering for your church of Ephesus;
so famous throughout the world.

9  They that are of the flesh
cannot do the works of the spirit;
neither they that are of the spirit
the works of the flesh; as he
that has faith cannot be an infidel;
nor he that is an infidel have
faith. But even those things
which ye do according to the flesh
are spiritual; forasmuch as ye do
all things in Jesus Christ.

10 Nevertheless I have heard
of some who have passed by you,
having perverse doctrine; whom
ye did not suffer to sow among
you; but stopped your ears, that
ye might not receive those things
that were sown by them: because
being the stones of the temple of
the Father, prepared for his
building; and drawn up on high
by the Cross of Christ,
as by an engine;

11.  Using the Holy Ghost as the
rope: your faith being your support;
and your charity the way that leads
unto God.

12  Ye are therefore, with all
your companions in the same
journey full of God; his spiritual
temples, full of Christ, and of
holiness: adorned in all things
with the commands of Christ.

13  In whom also I rejoice that
I have been thought worthy by
this present epistle to converse,
and joy together with you; that
with respect to the other life, ye
love nothing but God only.



CHAPTER III.

     1 Exorts them to prayer; to be unblamable.
     5 To be careful of salvation;
     11 frequent in public devotion;
     13 and to live in charity.

PRAY also without ceasing for
other men; for there is hope
of repentance in them, that they
may attain unto God. Let them
therefore at least be instructed by
your works, if they will be no
other way.

2  Be ye mild at their anger;
humble at their boasting; to their
blasphemies return your prayers
to their error, your firmness in
the faith; when they are cruel,
be ye gentle; not endeavouring
to imitate their ways.

(3  Let us be their brethren in
all kindness and moderation, but
let us be followers of the Lord;
for who was ever more unjustly
used? More destitute? More
despised?).

4  That so no herb of the devil
may be found in you: but ye may
remain in all holiness and sobriety
both of body and spirit, in Christ
Jesus.

5  The last times are come upon
us: let us therefore be very
reverent, and fear the long-
suffering of God, that it be
not to us unto condemnation.

6  For let us either fear the
wrath that is to come, or let us
love the grace that we at present
enjoy; that by the one or other of
these, we may be found in Christ
Jesus, unto true life.

7 Besides him, let nothing be
worthy of you; for whom also I
bear about these bonds; those
spiritual jewels, in which I would
to God that I might arise through
your prayers.

8  Of which I entreat you to
make me always partaker, that I
may be found in the lot of the
Christians of Ephesus, who have
always agreed with the Apostles,
through the power of Jesus Christ.

9 I know both who I am, and
to whom I write: I, a person
condemned; ye, such as have
obtained mercy; I, exposed
to danger; ye confirmed
against danger.

10  Ye are the passage of
those that are killed for God;
the companions of Paul in the
mysteries of the Gospel; the
holy, the martyr, the deservedly
most happy Paul: at whose feet
may I be found, when I shall have
attained unto God; who throughout
all his epistles, makes mention
of you in Christ Jesus.

11  Let it be your care therefore
to come more fully together, to
the praise and glory of God;
for when ye meet fully together
in the same place, the powers of
the devil are destroyed, and his
mischief is dissolved by the unity
of your faith.

12  And indeed, nothing is better
than peace, by which all war both
spiritual and earthly is abolished.

13  Of all which, nothing is hid
from you, if ye have perfect faith
and charity in Christ Jesus, which
are the beginning and end of life.

14  For the beginning is faith;
the end is charity. And these two
joined together, are of God; but
all other things which concern a
holy life, are the consequences of
these.

15  No man professing a true
faith, sinneth; neither does he
who has charity hate any.

16  The tree is made manifest
by its fruit; so they who profess
themselves to be Christians are
known by what they do.

17  For Christianity is not the
work of an outward profession;
but shows itself in the power of
faith, if a man be found faithful
unto the end.

18  It is better for a man to hold
his peace, and be; than to say, he
is a Christian, and not to be.

19  It is good to teach; if what
he says he does likewise.

20  There is therefore one master
who spake, and it was done; and
even those things which he did
without speaking, are worthy
of the Father.

21  He that possesses the word
of Jesus, is truly able to bear his
very silence. That he may be perfect,
be will do according to what he
speaks, and be known by those
things of which he is silent.

22  There is nothing hid from
God, but even our secrets are nigh
unto him.

23  Let us therefore do all
things, as becomes those who
have God dwelling in them;
that we maybe his temples;
and he may be our God as also
he is, and will manifest himself
before our faces, by those things
for which we justly love him,



CHAPTER IV.

     1 To have a care for the Gospel.
     9 The virginity of Mary, the incarnation,
     and the death of Christ, were hid from the Devil.
     11 How the birth of Christ was revealed.
     16 Exhorts to unity.

BE not deceived, my brethren:
those that corrupt families
by adultery, shall not inherit
the kingdom of God.

2  If therefore they who do this
according to the flesh, have
suffered death; how much more shall
he die, who by his wicked doctrine
corrupts the faith of God, for which
Christ was crucified?

3  He that is thus defiled, shall
depart into unquenchable fire, and
so also shall he that hearkens to
him.

4  For this cause did the Lord
suffer the ointment to be poured
on his head; that he might breathe
the breath of immortality unto his
church.

5  Be not ye therefore anointed
with the evil savour of the doctrine
of the prince of this world: let him
not take you captive from the life
that is set before you.

6  And why are we not all
wise, seeing we have received
the knowledge of God, which is
Jesus Christ? Why do we suffer
ourselves foolishly to perish;
not considering the gift which
the Lord has truly sent to us?

7  Let my life be sacrificed
for the doctrine of the cross;
which is indeed a scandal to the
unbelievers, but to us is salvation
and life eternal.

8  Where is the wise man?
Where is the disputer? Where
is the boasting of those who
are called wise?

9  For our Lord Jesus Christ was
according to the dispensation of
God, conceived in the womb of
Mary, of the seed of David,
by the Holy Ghost. He was born
and baptized, that through his
passion he might purify water,
to the washing away of sin.

10  Now the Virginity of Mary,
and he who was born of her, was
kept in secret from the prince of
this world; as was also the death
of our Lord: three of the mysteries
the most spoken of throughout the
world, yet done in secret by God.

11  How then was our Saviour
manifested to the world? A star
shone in heaven beyond all the
other stars, and its light was
inexpressible, and its novelty
struck terror into men's minds.
All the rest of the stars,
together with the sun and moon,
were the chorus to this star;
but that sent out its light
exceedingly above them all.

12  And men began to be troubled
to think whence this new star
came so unlike to all the others.

13  Hence all the power of magic
became dissolved; and every bond
of wickedness was destroyed: men's
ignorance was taken away; and
the old kingdom abolished; God
himself appearing in the form
of a man, for the renewal of
eternal life.

14  From thence began what
God had prepared: from thence.
forth things were disturbed;
forasmuch as he designed to
abolish death.

15 But if Jesus Christ shall
give me grace through your prayers,
and if it be his will, I purpose
in a second epistle which I will
suddenly write unto you, to manifest
to you more fully the dispensation
of which I have now begun to speak,
about the new man, which is Jesus
Christ; both in his faith, and
charity; in his suffering, and
in his resurrection.

16  Especially if the Lord shall
make known unto me, that ye all
by name come together united in
one faith, and in Jesus Christ;
who was of the race of David
according to the flesh; the Son
of man, and son of God; obeying
your bishop and the presbytery
with an entire affection; breaking
one and the same bread, which is
the medicine of immortality;
our antidote that we should not
die, but live for ever in Christ
Jesus.

17 My soul be for yours, and
theirs whom ye have sent, to the
glory of God; even unto Smyrna,
from whence also I write to you;
giving thanks unto the Lord and
loving Polycarp even as I do you.
Remember me, as Jesus Christ does
remember you.

18  Pray for the church which is
in Syria from whence I am carried
bound to Rome; being the least
of all the faithful which are there,
as I have been thought worthy to
be found, to the glory of God.

19  Fare ye well in God the
Father, and in Jesus Christ, our
common hope. Amen.




                            THE EPISTLE OF
                       IGNATIUS TO THE MAGNESIANS


CHAPTER I.

     4 Ignatius mentions the arrival of Damas,
     their bishop, and others,
     6 whom he exhorts them to reverence
     notwithstanding he was a young man.

IGNATIUS, who is also called
Theophorus, to the blessed
church, by the grace of God the
Father, in Jesus Christ our Saviour;
through whom I salute the church
which is at Magnesia, near the
Maeander: and wish it all joy in
God the Father, and in Jesus
Christ.

2  When I heard of your well-
ordered love and charity in God,
being full of joy, I desired much
to speak unto you in the faith of
Jesus Christ.

3  For having been thought
worthy to obtain a most excellent
name, in the bonds which I carry
about, I salute the churches;
wishing in them a union both of
the body and spirit of Jesus Christ,
our eternal life: as also of faith
and charity, to which nothing is
preferred: but especially of Jesus
and the Father; in whom if we
undergo all the injuries of the
prince of this present world, and
escape, we shall enjoy God,

4  Seeing, then, I have been
judged worthy to see you, by
Damas your most excellent bishop;
and by your worthy presbyters,
Bassus and Apollonius; and by my
fellow-servant Sotio, the deacon;

5  In whom I rejoice, forasmuch
as he is subject unto his bishop as
to the grace of God; and to the
presbytery as to the law of Jesus
Christ; I determined to write
unto you.

6  Wherefore it will become you
also not to use your bishop too
familiarly upon the account of his
youth; but to yield all reverence
to him according to the power of
God the Father; as also I perceive
that your holy presbyters do: not
considering his age, which indeed
to appearance is young; but as
becomes those who are prudent in
God, submitting to him, or rather
not to him but to the Father of our
Lord Jesus Christ, the bishop of
us all.

7  It will therefore behove you
with all sincerity, to obey your
bishop; in honour of him whose
pleasure it is that ye should do so.

8  Because he that does not do
so, deceives not the bishop whom
he sees, but affronts him that is
invisible. For whatsoever of this
kind is done, it reflects not upon
man, but upon God, who knows
the secrets of our hearts.

9  It is therefore fitting,
that we should not only be called
christians, but be so.

10  As some call indeed their
governor, bishop; but yet do all
things without him.

11  But I can never think
that such as these have a good
conscience, seeing that they are
not gathered together thoroughly
according to God's commandment.



CHAPTER II.

1 That as all must die,
4 he exhorts them to live orderly and in unity.


SEEING then all things have
an end, there are these two
indifferently set before us,
death and life: and everyone
shall depart unto his proper place.

2  For as there are two sorts of
coins, the one of God, the other of
the world, and each of these has
its proper inscription engraven
upon it; so also is it here.

3  The unbelievers are of this
world; but the faithful, through
charity have the character of God
the Father by Jesus Christ:
by whom if we are not readily
disposed to die after the likeness
of his passion, his life is not in us.

4  Forasmuch, therefore, as I
have in the persons before mentioned,
seen all of you in faith and charity;
I exhort you that ye study to do all
things in a divine concord:

5  Your bishop presiding in the
place of God; your presbyters in
the place of the council of the
Apostles; and your deacons most
dear to me, being entrusted with
the ministry of Jesus Christ; who
was the Father before all ages,
and appeared in the end to us.

6  Wherefore taking the same
holy course, see that ye all
reverence one another, and let no
one look upon his neighbour after
the flesh; but do ye all mutually
love each other in Jesus Christ.

7  Let there be nothing that may
be able to make a division among
you; but be ye united to your
bishop, and those who preside
over you, to be your pattern and
direction in the way to immortality.

8  As therefore the Lord did
nothing without the Father, being
united to him; neither by himself
nor yet by his Apostles, so neither
do ye do anything without your
bishop and presbyters:

9  Neither endeavour to let
anything appear rational to
yourselves apart;

10  But being come together into
the same place, have one common
prayer; one supplication;
one mind; one hope; one in charity,
and in joy undefiled.

11  There is one Lord Jesus
Christ, than whom nothing is better.
Wherefore come ye all together, as
unto one temple of God; as to one
altar; as to one: Jesus Christ,
who proceeded from one Father,
and exists in one; and is
returned to one.



CHAPTER III.

     1 He cautions them against false opinions.
     3 Especially those of Ebion and the Judaising Christians.

BE not deceived with strange
doctrines; nor with old fables
which are unprofitable.  For if
westill continue to live according
to the Jewish law, we do confess
ourselves not to have received grace.
For even the most holy prophets
lived according to Christ Jesus.

2  And for this cause were they
persecuted, being inspired by his
grace to convince the unbelievers
and disobedient that there is one
God who has manifested himself
by Jesus Christ his Son; who is
his eternal word, not coming forth
from silence; who in all things
pleased him that sent him.

3  Wherefore if they who were
brought up in these ancient laws,
came nevertheless to the newness
of hope; no longer observing
sabbaths, but keeping the Lord's
day in which also our life is
sprung up by him, and through
his death, whom yet some deny:

4 (By which mystery we have
been brought to believe and
therefore wait that we maybe
found the disciples of Jesus
Christ, our only master:)

5  How shall we be able to live
different from him; whose disciples
the very prophets themselves
being, did by the spirit expect him
as their master;

6  And therefore he whom they
justly waited for, being come,
raised, them up from the dead.

7  Let us not then be insensible
of his goodness; for should he
have dealt with us according to
our works, we had not now had a
being.

8  Wherefore being become his
disciples, let us learn to live
according to the rules of
Christianity; for whosoever is
called by any other name besides
this, he is not of God.

9  Lay aside therefore the old and
sour, and evil leaven; and be ye
changed into the new leaven, which
is Jesus Christ.

10  Be ye salted in him, lest any
one  among you should be corrupted;
for by your Savior ye shall
be judged.

11  It is absurd to name Jesus
Christ, and to Judaize. For the
christian religion did not embrace
the Jewish, but the Jewish the
christian; that so every tongue
that believed might be gathered
together unto God.

12  These things, my beloved, I
write unto you; not that I know
of any among you that lie under
this error: but as one of the least
among you, I am desirous to forewarn
you, that ye fall not into the
snares of false doctrine.

13  But that ye be fully instructed
in the birth, and suffering, and
resurrection of Jesus Christ,
our hope; which was accomplished
in the time of the government of
Pontius Pilate, and that most truly
and certainly: and from which God
forbid that any among you should
be turned aside.



CHAPTER IV.

     1 Commends their faith and piety; exhorts them
     to persevere;
     10 desires their prayers for himself and the
     church at Antioch.

MAY I therefore have joy of
you in all things, if I shall
be worthy of it. For though I am
bound, yet am I not worthy to be
compared to one of you that are at
liberty.

2  I know that ye are not puffed
up; for ye have Jesus Christ in
your hearts.

3  And especially when I commend
you, I know that ye are ashamed,
as it is written,  The just man
condemneth himself.

4  Study therefore to be confirmed
in the doctrine of our Lord, and
of his Apostles; that so whatever
ye do, ye may prosper both in body
and spirit, in faith and charity,
in the Son, and in the Father,
and in the Holy Spirit; in the
beginning, and in the end:

5  Together with your most worthy
bishop, and the well-wrought
spiritual crown of your presbytery,
and your deacons, which are
according to God.

6  Be subject to your bishop, and
to one another, as Jesus Christ
was to the Father, according to the
flesh; and the Apostles, both to
Christ, and to the Father; and to
the Holy Ghost: that so ye may
be united both in body and spirit.

7  Knowing you to be full of
God, I have the more briefly
exhorted you.

8  Be mindful of me in your
prayers, that I may attain unto
God, and of the church that is in
Syria, from which I am not worthy
to be called.

9  For I stand in need of your
joint prayers in God, and of your
charity, that the church which is
in Syria may he thought worthy
to be nourished by your church.

10  The Ephesians from Smyrna
salute you, from which place I
write unto you; (being present
here to the glory of God, in like
manner as you are,) who have in
all things refreshed me, together
with Polycarp, the bishop of the
Smyrneans.

11  The rest of the churches in
the honour of Jesus Christ salute
you.

12  Farewell, and be ye strengthened
in the concord of God; enjoying
his inseparable spirit, which
is Christ Jesus.




                            THE EPISTLE OF
                       IGNATIUS TO THE TRALLIANS.

CHAPTER 1.

     1 Acknowledges the coming of their bishop.
     5 Commends them for their subjection to their bishop,
     priests, and deacons; and exhorts them to continue in it:
     15 is afraid even of his over-great desire to suffer,
     lest it should be prejudicial to him.

IGNATTUS, who is also called
Theophorus, to the holy church
which is at Tralles in Asia:
beloved of God, the Father of Jesus
Christ; elect and worthy of God,
having peace through the flesh and
blood, and passion of Jesus Christ
our hope; in the resurrection which
is by him: which also I salute in
its fullness, continuing in the
apostolical character, wishing all
joy and happiness unto it.

2  I have heard of your blameless
and constant disposition through
patience, which not only appears
in your outward conversation, but
is naturally rooted and grounded
in you.

3  In like manner as Polybius
your bishop has declared unto me,
who came to me to Smyrna, by the
will of God and Jesus Christ, and
so rejoiced together with me in my
bonds for Jesus Christ, that in
effect I saw your whole church in
him.

4  Having therefore received
testimony of your good will towards
me for God's sake, by him; I seemed
to find you, as also I knew that ye
were the followers of God.

5  For whereas ye are subject to
your bishop as to Jesus Christ, ye
appear to one to live not after the
manner of men, but according to
Jesus Christ who died for us,
that so believing in his death,
ye might escape death.

6  It is therefore necessary, that
as ye do, so without your bishop
you should do nothing: also be
ye subject to your presbyters, as
to the Apostles of Jesus Christ our
hope; in whom if we walk, we
shall be found in him.

7  The deacons also, as being
the ministers of the mysteries of
Jesus Christ, must by all means
please ye. For they are not the
ministers of meat and drink,
but of the church of God. Wherefore
they must avoid all offences,
as they would do fire.

8  In like manner let us reverence
the deacons as Jesus Christ;
and the bishop as the Father; and
the presbyters as the Sanctuary of
God, and college of the Apostles.

9  Without these there is no
church; concerning all which, I
am persuaded that ye think after
the very same manner; for I have
received, and even now have with
me, the pattern of your love, in
your bishop.

10  Whose very look is instructive;
and whose mildness powerful: whom
I am persuaded, the very Atheists
themselves cannot but reverence.

11  But because I have a love
towards you, I will not write any
more sharply unto you about this
matter, though I very well might
but now I have done so, lest being
a condemned man, I should seem
to prescribe to you as an Apostle.

12  I have great knowledge in
God; but I refrain myself, lest
I should perish in my boasting.

13  For now I ought the more
to fear, and not to hearken to
those that would puff me up.

14  For they that speak to me,
in my praise, chasten me.

15  For I indeed desire to suffer,
but I cannot tell whether I am
worthy so to do.

16  And this desire, though to
others it does not appear, yet to
myself it is for that very reason
the more violent. I have, therefore,
need of moderation; by which the
prince of this world is destroyed.

17  Am I not able to write to
you of heavenly things?--But I
fear lest I should harm you, who
are yet but babes in Christ;
(excuse me this care;) and lest
perchance being not able to
receive them, ye should be
choken with them.

18  For even I myself, although
I am in bonds, yet am not therefore
able to understand heavenly things;

19  As the assembly of angels,
and the several companies of them,
under their respective princes;
things visible and invisible: but
in these I am yet a learner.

20  For many things are wanting to
us, that we come not short of God.



CHAP. II.

     1 Warns them against heretics,
     4 exhorts them to humility and unity,
     10 and briefly sets before them the true
     doctrine concerning Christ.

EXHORT you therefore, or
rather not I, but the love of
Jesus Christ; that ye use none but
christian nourishment; abstaining
from pasture which is of another
kind, I mean heresy.

2  For they that are heretics,
confound together the doctrine of
Jesus Christ, with their own poison:
whilst they seem worthy of belief:

3  As men give a deadly potion
mixed with sweet wine; which he
who drinks of, does with the
treacherous pleasure sweetly
drink in his own death.

4  Wherefore guard yourself
against such persons; and that
you will do, if you are not puffed
up; but continue inseparable from
Jesus Christ our God, and from
your bishop, and from the
commands of the Apostles.

5  He that is within the altar,
is pure; but he that is without,
namely, does anything without the
bishop, the presbyters, and deacons,
is not pure in his conscience.

6  Not that I know there is any
thing of this nature among you;
but I fore-arm you, as being
greatly beloved by me, foreseeing
the snares of the devil.

7  Wherefore putting on meekness,
renew yourselves in faith,
which is the flesh of the Lord;
and in charity, which is the blood
of Jesus Christ.

8  Let no man have any grudge
against his neighbour. Give no
occasion to the Gentiles; lest by
means of a few foolish men, the
whole congregation of God be
evil spoken of.

9  For woe to that man through
whose vanity my name is
blasphemed by any.

10  Stop your ears therefore,
as often as any one shall speak
contrary to Jesus Christ, who was
of the race of David; by the Virgin
Mary.

11  Who was truly born, and
did eat and drink; was truly
persecuted under Pontius Pilate;
was truly crucified and dead; both
those in heaven and on earth, and
under the earth, being spectators
of it:

12  Who, was also truly raised
from the dead by his Father, after
the same manner as HE will also
raise up us who believe in him by
Christ Jesus; without whom we
have no true life.

13  But if, as some who are
Atheists, that is to say infidels,
pretend, that he seemed to suffer,
(they themselves only seeming to
exist) why then am I bound?--
Why do I desire to fight with
beasts?--Therefore do I die in
vain: therefore I will not speak
falsely against the Lord.

14  Flee therefore these evil
sprouts which bring forth deadly
fruit; of which if any one taste,
he shall presently die.

15  For these are not the plants
of the Father; seeing if they were,
they would appear to be the
branches of the cross, and their
fruit would be incorruptible; by
which he invites you through his
passion, who are members of him.

16  For the head cannot be without
its members, God having promised
a union with himself.



CHAP. III.

     He again exhorts to unity, and desires their
     prayers for himself, and for his church at Antioch.

I SALUTE you from Smyrna,
together with the churches of
God that are present with me;
who have refreshed me in all
things, both in the flesh and
in the spirit.

2 My bonds, which I carry about
me for the sake of Christ,
(beseeching him that I may
attain unto God) exhort you that
you continue in concord among
yourselves, and in prayer with
one another.

3  For it becomes everyone of
you, especially the presbyters, to
refresh the bishop, to the honour
of the Father of Jesus Christ, and
of the Apostles.

4  I beseech you, that you hearken
to me in love; that I may not by
those things which I write, rise up
in witness against you.

5  Pray also for me; who,
through the mercy of God, stand
in need of your prayers, that I
may be worthy of the portion which
I am about to obtain, and that I
be not found a reprobate.

6  The love of those who are at
Smyrna and Ephesus salute you.
Remember in your prayers the
church of Syria, from which I am
not worthy to be called, being one
of the least of it.

7  Fare ye well in Jesus Christ;
being subject to your bishop as to
the command of God; and so like.
wise to the presbytery.

8  Love every one his brother
with an unfeigned heart.  My soul
be your expiation, not only now,
but when I shall have attained
unto God; for I am yet under
danger.

9  But the Father is faithful in
Jesus Christ, to fulfil both mine
and your petition; in whom may
ye be found unblamable.





                             THE EPISTLE OF
                        IGNATIUS TO THE ROMANS.


CHAPTER I.

     Ignatius testifies his desire to see, and his
     hopes of suffering for Christ
     5 which he earnestly entreats them not to prevent,
     10 but to pray for him, that God would strengthen
     him to the combat.


IGNATIUS, who is also called
Theophorus, to the church
which has obtained mercy from
the majesty of the Most High
Father, and his only begotten
Son Jesus Christ; beloved, and
illuminated through the will of him
who willeth all things which are
according to the love of Jesus
Christ our God; which also presides
in the place of the region
of the Romans; and which I salute
in the name of Jesus Christ, as
being united both in flesh and
spirit to all his commands, and
filed with the grace of God; with
all joy in Jesus Christ our God.

2  Forasmuch as I have at last
obtained through my prayers to
God, permission to see your faces,
which I much desired to do; being
bound in Jesus Christ, I hope ere
long to salute you, if it shall be
the will of God to grant me to
attain unto the end I long for.

3  For the beginning is well
disposed, if I shall but have grace,
without hindrance, to receive what
is appointed for me.

4  But I fear your love, lest it
do me an injury; for it is easy for
you to do what you please; but it
will be hard for me to attain unto
God, if you spare me.

5  But I would not that ye
should please men, but God; whom
also ye do, please. For neither
shall I hereafter have such an
opportunity of going unto God; nor
will you, if ye shall now be silent,
ever be entitled to a better work.
For if you, shall be silent in my
behalf, I shall be made partaker of
God.

6  But if you shall love my body,
I shall have my course again to
run. Wherefore ye cannot do me
a greater kindness, than to suffer
me to be sacrificed unto God, now
that the altar is already prepared:

7  That when ye shall be gathered
together in love, ye nay give
thanks to the Father through
Christ Jesus, that he has
vouchsafed to bring a bishop
of Syria unto you, being called
from the east unto the west.

8  For it is good for me to turn
from the world, unto God; that I
may rise again unto him.

9  Ye have never envied any one;
ye have taught others. I would
therefore that ye should now do
those things yourselves, which
in your instructions you have
prescribed to others.

10  Only pray for me, that God
would give me both inward and
outward strength, that I may not
only say, but will; nor be only
called a christian, but be found
one.

11  For if I shall be found a
christian, I may then deservedly
be called one; and be thought
faithful, when I shall no longer
appear to the world.

12  Nothing is good, that is
seen.

13  For even our God, Jesus
Christ, now that he is in the
Father, does so much the more
appear.

14  A christian is not a work of
opinion; but of greatness of mind,
especially when he is hated by the
world.



CHAPTER. II.

     Expresses his great desire and determination
     to suffer martyrdom.

I WRITE to the churches, and
signify to them all, that I am
willing to die for God, unless you
hinder me.

2  I beseech you that you show
not an unseasonable good will
towards me. Suffer me to be food
to the wild beasts, by whom I shall
attain unto God.

3  For I am the wheat of God,
and I shall be ground by the teeth
of the wild-beasts, that I may be
found the pure bread of Christ.
Rather encourage the beasts,
that they may became my sepulchre,
and may let live nothing of my
body; that being dead I may not
be troublesome to any.

5  Then shall I be truly the
disciple of Jesus Christ, when the
world shall not see so much as my
body. Pray therefore unto Christ
for me, that by these instruments
I may be made the sacrifice of
God.

6  I do not, as Peter and Paul,
command you. They were Apostles,
I a condemned man; they were free,
but I am even to this day a servant:

7  But if I shall suffer, I shall
then become the freeman of Jesus
Christ, and shall rise free. And
now, being in bonds, I learn not
to desire any thing.

8  From Syria even unto Rome,
I fight with beasts both by sea and
land; both night and day: being
bound to ten leopards, that is to
say, to such a band of soldiers,
who, though treated with all manner
of kindness, are the worse for
it.

9  But I am the more instructed
by their injuries; yet am I not
therefore justified.

10  May I enjoy the wild beasts
that are prepared for me; which
also I wish may exercise all their
fierceness upon me.

11  And whom for that end I will
encourage, that they may be sure
to devour me, and not serve me as
they have done some, whom out of
fear they have not touched. But
if they will not do it willingly,
I will provoke them to it.

12  Pardon me in this matter; I
know what is profitable for me,
now I begin to be a disciple.
Not shall any thing move me
whether visible or invisible,
that I may attain to Jesus Christ.

13  Let fire and the cross; let
the companies of wild beasts;
let breakings of bones, and tearing
of members; let the shattering in
pieces of the whole body, and all
the wicked torments of the devil
come upon me; only let me enjoy
Jesus Christ.

14  All the ends of the world,
and the kingdoms of it, will profit
me nothing: I would rather die
for Jesus Christ, than rule to the
utmost ends of the earth. Him
I seek who died for us; him I
desire who rose again for us.
This is the gain that is laid up
for me.

15  Pardon me, my brethren, ye
shall not hinder me from living;
nor seeing I desire to go to God,
may you separate me from him,
for the sake of this world;--nor
induce me by any of the desires of
it. Suffer me to enter into pure
light, where being come, I shall
be indeed the servant of God.

16  Permit me to imitate the
passion of my God. If any one has
God within himself, let him consider
what I desire; and let him have
compassion on me, as knowing how
I am straightened.



CHAPTER III.

     Further expresses his desire to suffer.

THE prince of this world would
fain carry me away, and corrupt
my resolution towards my God.
Let none of you therefore help
him; rather do ye join with me,
that is, with God.

2  Do not speak with Jesus
Christ, and yet covet the world.
Let not any envy dwell with you;
no, not though I myself, when I
shall be come unto you, should
exhort you to it, yet do not ye
hearken to me; but rather believe
what I now write to you.

3  For though I am alive at the
writing of this, yet my desire is
to die. My love is crucified; and
the fire that is within me does
not desire any water; but being
alive and springing within me,
says, Come to the Father.

4  I take no pleasure in the food
of corruption, nor in the pleasures
of this life.

5  I desire the bread of God
which is the flesh of Jesus Christ,
of the seed of David; and the
drink that I long for is his blood,
which is incorruptible love.

6  I have no desire to live any
longer after the manner of men;
neither shall I, if you consent.
Be ye therefore willing, that ye
yourselves also maybe pleasing to
God. I exhort you in a few words;
I pray you believe me.

7  Jesus Christ will shew you
that I speak truly. My mouth is
without deceit, and the Father
hath truly spoken by it. Pray
therefore for me, that I may
accomplish what I desire.

8  I have not written to you after
the flesh, but according to the will
of God. If I shall suffer, ye have
loved me: but if I shall be rejected,
ye have hated me.

9  Remember in your prayers
the church of Syria, which now
enjoys God for its shepherd instead
of me. Let Jesus Christ only  oversee
it, and your charity.

10  But I am even ashamed to
be reckoned as one of them; for
neither am I worthy, being the
least among them, and as one
born out of due season. But
through mercy I have risen to
be somebody, if I shall get unto
God.

11  My spirit salutes you; and
the charity of the churches that
have received me in the name of
Jesus Christ; not as a passenger,
for even they that were not near
to me in the way, have gone before
me to the next city to meet me.

12  These things I write to you
from Smyrna, by the most worthy
of the church of Ephesus.

13  There is now with me, together
with many others, Crocus, most
beloved of me. As for those which
are come from Syria, and are gone
before me to Rome, to the glory
of God, I suppose you are not
ignorant of them.

14  Ye shall therefore signify to
them that I draw near, for they,
are all worthy both of God and of
you: Whom it is fit that you
refresh in all things.

15  This have I written to you,
the day before the ninth of the,
calends of September. Be strong
unto the end, in the patience of
Jesus Christ.






                     IGNATIUS TO THE PHILADELPHIANS.


CHAPTER I.

     Commends their bishop, whom they had sent unto him,
     warns them against division and schism.

IGNATIUS, who is also called
Theophorus, to the church of
God the Father, and our Lord
Jesus Christ, which is at Philadelphia
in Asia; which has obtained mercy,
being fixed in the concord of God,
and rejoicing evermore in the passion
of our Lord, and being fulfilled in
all mercy through his resurrection:
Which also I salute in the blood of
Jesus Christ, which is our eternal
and undefiled joy; especially if
they are at unity with the bishop,
and presbyters who are with him,
and the deacons appointed according
to the mind of Jesus Christ; whom
he has settled according to his own
will in all firmness by his Holy
Spirit:

2  Which bishop I know obtained
that great ministry among you,
not of himself, neither by men,
nor out of vain glory; but by the
love of God the Father, and our
Lord Jesus Christ.

3  Whose moderation I admire;
who by his silence is able to do
more than others with all their
vain talk. For he is fitted to the
commands, as the harp to its strings.

4  Wherefore my soul esteems
his mind towards God most happy,
knowing it to be fruitful in all
virtue, and perfect; full of
constancy, free from passion,
and according to all the
moderation of the living God.

5  Wherefore as becomes the
children both of the light and of
truth; flee divisions and false
doctrines; but where your shepherd
is, there do ye, as sheep, follow
after.

6  For there are many wolves
who seem worthy of belief, that
with a false pleasure lead captive
those that run in the course of
God; but in the concord they shall
find no place.

7  Abstain therefore from those
evil herbs which Jesus Christ does
not dress: because such are not
the plantation of the Father. Not
that I have found any division
among you, but rather all manner
of purity.

8  For as many as are of God,
and of Jesus Christ, are also with
their bishop. And as many as
shall with repentance return into
the unity of the church, even these
shall also be the servants of God,
that they may live according to
Jesus Christ.

9  Be not deceived brethren;
if any one follows him that makes
a schism in the church, he shall
not inherit the kingdom of God.
If any one walks after any other
opinion, he agrees not with the
passion of Christ.

10  Wherefore let it be your
endeavour to partake all of the
same holy eucharist.

11  For there is but one flesh of
our Lord Jesus Christ; one cup
in the unity of his blood; and one
altar;

12  As also there is one bishop,
together with his presbytery, and
the deacons my fellow servants
that so whatsoever ye do, ye may
do it according to the will of God.



CHAPTER II.

Desires their prayers, and to be
united, but not to Judaize.

MY brethren, the love I have
towards you makes me the
more large; and having a great
joy in you, I endeavour to secure
you against danger; or rather not
I, but Jesus Christ; in whom
being bound, I the more fear,
as being yet only on the way
to suffering.

2  But your prayer to God shall
make me perfect, that I may attain
to that portion, which by God's
mercy is allotted to me Fleeing
to the Gospel as to the flesh of
Christ; and to the Apostles as
to the presbytery of the church.

3  Let us also love the prophets,
forasmuch as they have led us
to the Gospel, and to hope in
Christ, and to expect him.

4  In whom also believing they
were saved in the unity of Jesus
Christ; being holy men, worthy
to be loved, and had in wonder;

5  Who have received testimony
from Jesus Christ, and are
numbered in the Gospel of our
common hope.

6  But if any one shall preach
the Jewish law unto you, hearken
not unto him; for it is better to
receive the doctrine of Christ from
one that has been circumcised, than
Judaism from one that has not.

7  But if either the one, or other,
do not speak concerning Christ
Jesus; they seem to me to be but
as monuments and sepulchres of
the dead, upon which are written
only the names of men.

8  Flee therefore the wicked arts
and snares of the prince of this
world; lest at any time being
oppressed by his cunning, ye grow
cold in your charity. But come
altogether into the same place,
with an undivided heart.

9  And I bless my God that I
have a good conscience towards
you, and that no one among you
has whereof to boast either openly
or privately, that I have been
burthensome to him in much or
little.

10  And I wish to all, among
whom I have conversed, that
may not turn to a witness again
them.

11  For although some would
have deceived me according to
the flesh, yet the spirit, being
from God, is not deceived: for it
knows, both whence it comes and
whither it goes, and reproves the
secrets of the heart.

12  I cried whilst I was among
you; I spake with a loud voice:
attend to the bishop, and to the
presbytery, and to the deacons.

13  Now some supposed that I spake
this as foreseeing the division
that should come among you.

14  But he is my witness for
whose sake I am in bonds that
I know nothing from any man.
But the spirit spake, saying
on this wise: Do nothing without
the bishop:

15  Keep your bodies as the
temples of God: Love unity;
Flee divisions; Be the followers
of Christ, as he was of his Father.

16  I therefore did as became
me, as a man composed to unity
for where there is division,
and wrath, God dwelleth not.

17  But the Lord forgives all
that repent, if they return to the
unity of God, and to the council
of the bishop.

18  For I trust in the grace
Jesus Christ that he will free
you from every bond.

19 Nevertheless I exhort you
that you do nothing out of strife
but according to the instruction
of Christ.

20 Because I have heard
some who say; unless I find
written in the originals, I will
not believe it to be written in
the Gospel. And when I said,
It is written; they answered
from what lay before them in the
corrupted copies.

21  But to me Jesus Christ
instead of all the uncorrupted
monuments in the world; together
with those undefiled monuments,
his cross, and death, and
resurrection, and the faith
which is by him; by which I
desire, through your prayers,
to be justified.

22  The priests indeed are
good; but much better is the High
Priest to whom the Holy of Holies
has been committed; and who
alone has been intrusted with the
secrets of God.

23  He is the door of the Father;
by which Abraham, and Isaac,
and Jacob, and all the prophets,
enter in; as well as the Apostles,
and the church.

24  And all these things tend to
the unity which is of God. Howbeit
the Gospel has somewhat in it far
above all other dispensations;
namely, the appearance of our
Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ,
his passion and resurrection.

25  For the beloved prophets
referred to him; but the Gospel
is the perfection of incorruption.
All therefore together are good,
if ye believe with charity.



CHAPTER III.

     Informs them he had heard that the persecution
     was stopped at Antioch: and directs them to send
     a messenger thither to congratulate with the church.

NOW as concerning the church
of Antioch which is in Syria,
seeing I am told that through
your prayers and the bowels which
ye have towards it in Jesus Christ,
it is in peace; it will become you,
as the church of God, to ordain
some I deacon to go to them thither
as the ambassador of God; that
he may rejoice with them when
they meet together, and glorify
God's name.

2  Blessed be that man in Jesus,
Christ, who shall be found worthy
of such a ministry; and ye yourselves
also shall be glorified.

3  Now if you be willing, it is
not impossible for you to do this
for the grace of God; as also the
other neighbouring churches have
sent them some bishops, some
priests and some deacons.

4  As concerning Philo the deacon
of Cilicia, a most worthy  man,
he still ministers unto me in the
word of God: together with Rheus
of Agathopolis a singular good
person, who has followed me even
from Syria, not regarding his life:
These also bear witness unto you.

5  And I myself give thanks to
God for you, that you receive them
as the Lord shall receive you.
But for those that dishonoured
them, may they be forgiven
through the grace of Jesus Christ.

6  The charity of the brethren
that are at Troas salutes you:
from whence also I now write
by Burrhurs, who was sent together
with me by those of Ephesus and
Smyrna, for respect sake.

7  May our Lord Jesus Christ
honour them; in whom they hope,
both in flesh, and soul, and spirit;
in faith, in love, in unity.
Fare-well in Christ Jesus our
common hope.






                        IGNATIUS TO THE SMYRNEANS.

CHAPTER I.

     1 Declares his joy for their firmness in the Gospel.
     4 Enlarges on the person of Christ, against such
     as pretend that Christ did not suffer.

IGNATIUS, who is also called
Theohorus, to the church of
God the Father, and of the beloved
Jesus Christ, which God hath
mercifully blessed with every
good gift; being filled with faith
and charity, so that it is wanting
in no gift; most worthy of God,
and fruitful in saints; the church
which is at Smyrna in Asia; all
through his immaculate spirit,
through word of God.

2  I glorify God, even Jesus
Christ, who has given you such
wisdom.

3  For I have observed that you
are settled in an immoveable faith,
as if you were nailed to the cross
of our Lord Jesus Christ, both in
the flesh and in the spirit; and
are confirmed in love through the
blood of Christ; being fully
persuaded of those things which
relate unto our Lord.

4  Who truly was of the race
of David according to the flesh,
but the Son of God according to
the will and power of God;
truly born of the Virgin, and
baptised of John; that so all
righteousness might be fulfilled
by him.

5  He was also truly crucified
by Pontius Pilate, and Herod the
Tetrarch, being nailed for us in
the flesh; by the fruits of which
we are, even by his most blessed
Passion;

6  That he might set up a token
for all ages through his resurrection,
to all his holy and faithful servants,
whether they be Jews or Gentiles,
in one body of his church.

7  Now all these things he suffered
for us that we might be saved; and
he suffered truly, as he also truly
raised up himself; and not, as some
unbelievers say, that he only seemed
to suffer; they themselves 'only
seeming to be.'

8  And as they believe so shall it
happen unto them, when being divested
of the body they shall become mere
spirits.

9  But I know that even after his
resurrection he was in the flesh;
and I believe that he is still so.

10  And when he came to those
who were with Peter, he said
unto them, Take, handle me, and
see that I am not an incorporeal
daemon. And straightway they
felt and believed; being convinced
both by his flesh and spirit.

11  For this cause they despised
death, and were bound to be above
it.

12  But after his resurrection he
did eat and drink with them, as he
was flesh; although as to his
Spirit he was united to the Father.



CHAPTER II.

     1 Exhorts them against heretics.
     8 The danger of their doctrine.

NOW these things, beloved, I put
you in mind of, not questioning
but that you yourselves also
believe that they are so.

2  But I arm you before-hand
against certain beasts in the shape
of men, whom you must not only
not receive, but if it be possible
must not meet with.

3  Only you must pray for them,
that if it be the will of God they
may repent; which yet will be
very hard. But of this our Lord
Jesus Christ has the power, who
is our true life.

4  For if all these things were
done only in show by our Lord,
then do I also seem only to be
bound:

5  And why have I given up myself
to death, to the fire, to the
sword, to wild beasts?

6  But now the nearer I am to
the sword, the nearer I am to
God: when I shall come among
the wild beasts, I shall come to
God.

7  Only in the name of Jesus
Christ, I undergo all, to suffer
together with him; he who was
made a perfect man strengthening,
me.

8  Whom some not knowing, do
deny; or rather have been denied
by him, being the advocates of
death, rather than of the truth.
Whom neither the prophecies, nor
the law of Moses have persuaded;
nor the Gospel itself, even to this
day; nor the sufferings of every
one of us.

9  For they think also the same
things of us. For what does a
man profit me, if he shall praise
me, and blaspheme my Lord; not
confessing that he was truly made
man?

10  Now he that doth not say
this, does in effect deny him,
and is in death. But for the names
of such as do this, they being
unbelievers, I thought it not
fitting to write them unto you.

11  Yea, God forbid that I should
make any mention of them, till
they shall repent to a true belief
of Christ's passion, which is our
resurrection.

12  Let no man deceive himself;
both the things which are in heaven,
and the glorious angels, and princes,
whether visible or invisible, if they
believe not in the blood of Christ,
it shall be to them, unto condemnation.

13  He that is able to receive
this, let him receive it. Let no
man's place or state in the world
puff him up: that which is worth
all his faith and charity, to it
nothing is to be preferred.

14  But consider those who are
of a different opinion from us,
as to what concerns the grace of
Jesus Christ which is come unto us,
how contrary they are to the
design of God.

15  They have no regard to charity,
no care of the widow, the fatherless,
and the oppressed; of the bond or
free, of the hungry or thirsty.

16  They abstain from the eucharist,
and from the public offices;
because they confess not the eucharist
to be the flesh of our Saviour Jesus
Christ which suffered for our sins,
and which the Father of his goodness
raised again from the dead.

17  And for this cause contradicting
the gift of God, they die in their
disputes; but much better would it
be for them to receive it, that they
might one day rise through it.

18  It will therefore become you.
to abstain from such persons, and
not to speak with them, neither in
public nor in private.

19  But to hearken to the prophets,
and especially to the Gospel, in
which both Christ's passion is
manifested unto us, and his
resurrection perfectly declared.

20  But flee all divisions, as the
beginning of evils.



CHAPTER III.

     1 Exhorts them to follow their bishop and pastors;
     but especially their bishop.
     6 Thanks them for their kindness,
     11 and acquaints them with the ceasing of the
      persecution at Antioch.

SEE that ye all follow your
bishop, as Jesus Christ, the
Father; and the presbytery, as
the Apostles; and reverence the
deacons, as the command of God.

2  Let no man do any thing
of what belongs to the church
separately from the bishop.

3  Let that eucharist be looked
upon as well established, which is
either offered by the bishop, or by
him to whom the bishop has given.
his consent.

4  Wheresoever the bishop shall
appear, there let the people also
be: as where Jesus Christ is, there
is the Catholic church.

5  It is not lawful without the
bishop; neither to baptize, nor to
celebrate the Holy Communion
but whatsoever he shall approve
of, that is also pleasing unto God;
that so whatever is done, may be
sure and well done.

6  For what remains, it is very
reasonable that we should repent
whilst there is yet time to return
unto God.

7  It is a good thin to have a
due regard both to God, and to
the bishop: he that honours the
bishop, shall be honoured of God;
but he that does any thing without
his knowledge, ministers unto the
devil.

8  Let all things therefore abound
to you in charity; seeing that ye
are worthy.

9  Ye have refreshed me in all
things; so shall Jesus Christ you.
Ye have loved me both when I was
present with you, and now being
absent, ye cease not to do so.

10  May God be your reward,
for whom whilst ye undergo all
things, ye shall attain unto
him.

11  Ye have done well in that ye
have received Philo, and Rheus
Agathopus, who followed me for
the word of God, as the deacons
of Christ our God.

12  Who also gave thanks unto
the Lord for you, forasmuch as ye
have refreshed them in all things.
Nor shall any thing that you have
done be lost to you.

13  My soul be for yours, and
my bonds which ye have not despised,
nor been ashamed of. Wherefore
neither shall. Jesus Christ,
our perfect faith, be ashamed
of you.

14  Your prayer is come to the
church of Antioch, which is in
Syria. From whence being sent
bound with chains becoming God.
I salute the churches; being not
worthy to be called from thence,
as being the least among them.

15  Nevertheless by the will of
God I have been thought worthy
of this honour; not for that I
think I have deserved it, but by
the grace of God;

16  Which I wish may be perfectly
given unto me, that through your
prayers I may attain unto God.

17  And therefore, that your
work may be fully accomplished,
both upon earth and in heaven;
it will be fitting, and for the
honour of God, that your church
appoint some worthy deldgate,
who being come as far as Syria,
may rejoice together with them
that they are in peace; and that
they are again restored to their
former state, and have again
received their proper body.

18  Wherefore I should think it
a worthy action, to send some
one from you with an epistle,
to congratulate with them their
peace in God; and that through
your prayers, they have now
gotten to their harbour.

19  For inasmuch as ye are perfect
yourselves, you ought to think
those things that are perfect. For
when you are desirous to do well,
God is ready to enable you there.
unto.

20  The love of the brethren that
are at Troas salute you; from whence
I write to you by Burrhus whom ye
sent with me, together with the
Ephesians, your brethren; and who
has in all Things refreshed me.

21  And I would to God that all
would imitate him, as being a pattern
of the ministry of God. May his grace
fully reward him.

22  I salute your very worthy
bishop, and your venerable presbytery;
and your deacons, my fellow-servants;
and all of you in general, and every
one in particular, in the name of
Jesus Christ, and in his flesh and
blood; in his passion and resurrection
both fleshly and spiritually; and in
the unity of God with you.

23  Grace be with you, and mercy,
and peace, and patience, for evermore.

24  I salute the families of my
brethren, with their wives and
children; and the virgins that are
called widows. Be strong in the
power of the Holy Ghost. Philo,
who is present with me salutes
you.

25  I salute the house of Tavias,
and pray that it may be strengthened
in faith and charity, both of flesh
and spirit.

26  I salute Alce my well-beloved,
together with the incomparable
Daphnus, and Eutechnus, and all
by name.

27 Farewell in the grace of God.






                           IGNATIUS TO POLYCARP

CHAPTER I.

Ignatius blesses God for the firm,
establishment of Polycarp in the
faith, and gives him particular
directions for improving it.

IGNATIUS, who is also called
Theophorus, to Polycarp, bishop
of the church which is at Smyrna;
their overseer, but rather himself
overlooked by God the Father,
and the Lord Jesus Christ;
all happiness.

2  Having known that thy mind
towards God, is fixed as it were
upon an immoveable rock;
I exceedingly give thanks, that
I have been thought worthy to
behold thy blessed face, in
which may I always rejoice in God.

3  Wherefore I beseech thee by
the grace of God with which thou
art clothed, to press forward in
thy course, and to exhort all
others that they may be saved.

4  Maintain thy place with all
care both of flesh and spirit: Make
it thy endeavour to preserve unity,
than which nothing is better.
Bear with all men even as the
Lord with thee.

5  Support all in love, as also
thou dost. Pray without ceasing
ask more understanding than what
thou already hast. Be watchful,
having thy spirit always awake.

6  Speak to every one according
as God shall enable thee. Bear
the infirmities of all, as a
perfect combatant; where the
labour is great, the gain is
the more.

7  If thou shalt love the good
disciples, what thank is it? But
rather do thou subject to thee
those that are mischievous, in
meekness.

8  Every wound is not healed
with the same plaister: if the
accessions of the disease be
vehement, modify them with soft
remedies: be in all things wise
as a serpent, but harmless as a
dove.

9  For this cause thou art
composed of flesh and spirit;
that thou mayest modify those
things that appear before thy face.

10  And as for those that are not
seen, pray to God that he would
reveal them into thee, that so
thou mayest be wanting in nothing,
but mayest abound in every gift.

11  The times demand thee, as
the pilots the winds; and be that
is tossed in a tempest, the haven
where he would be.

12  That thou mayest attain unto
God, be sober as the combatant
of God. The crown proposed to
thee is immortality, and eternal
life: concerning which thou art
also fully persuaded. I will be
thy surety in all things, by my
bonds, which thou halt loved.

13  Let not those that seem
worthy of credit, but teach other
doctrines, disturb thee. Stand
firm and immoveable, as an anvil
when it is beaten upon.

14  It is the part of a brave
combatant to be wounded, and yet
overcome. But especially we ought
to endure all things for God's
sake, that he may bear with us.

15  Be every day better than
others; consider the times, and
expect him, who is above all time,
eternal; invisible, though for our
sakes made visible: impalpable,
and impassible, yet for us
subjected to sufferings; enduring
all manner of ways for our salvation.



CHAPTER II.

     1 Continues his advice,
     6 and teaches him how to advise others.
     12 Enforces unity and subjection to the bishop.

LET not the widows be neglected:
be thou after God, their Guardian.

2  Let nothing be done without thy
knowledge and consent; neither do
thou anything but according to the
will of God; as also thou dost,
with all constancy.

3  Let your assemblies be more
full: inquire into all by name.

4  Overlook not the men and
maid servants; neither let them
be puffed up: but rather let them
be the more subject to the glory
of God, that they may obtain from
him a better liberty.

5  Let them not desire to be
set free at the public cost, that
they be not slaves to their own
lusts.

6  Flee evil arts; or rather make
not any mention of them.

7  Say to my sisters, that they
love the Lord; and be satisfied
with their own husbands, both in
the flesh and spirit.

8  In like manner, exhort my
brethren in the name of Jesus
Christ, that they love their wives,
even as the Lord the church.

9  If any man can remain in a
virgin state, to the honour of the
flesh of Christ, let him remain
without boasting; but if he boast,
he is undone. And if he desire to
be more taken notice of than the
bishop he is corrupted.

10  But it becomes all such as
are married, whether men or women,
to come together with the consent
of the bishop, that so their
marriage may be according to
godliness, and not in lust.

11  Let all things be done to the
honour of God.

12  Hearken unto the bishop,
that God also may hearken unto
you. My soul be security for
them that submit to their bishop,
with their presbyters and deacons.
And may my portion be together
with theirs in God.

13  Labour with one another;
contend together, run together,
suffer together; sleep together,
and rise together; as the stewards,
and assessors, and ministers of
God.

14  Please him under whom ye
war; and from whom ye receive
your wages. Let none of you be
found a deserter; but let your
baptism remain, as your arms;
your faith, as your helmet; your
charity, as your spear; your
patience, as your whole armour.

15  Let your works be your
charge, that so you may receive
a suitable reward. Be long
suffering therefore towards each
other in meekness; as God is
towards you.

16  Let me have joy of you in
all things.



CHAPTER III.

     1 Greets Polycarp on the peace of the church at Antioch:
     2 and desires him to write to that and other churches.

NOW forasmuch as the church
of Antioch in Lyria is, as
I am told, in peace through your
prayers; I also have been the more
comforted, and without care in
God; if so be that by suffering, I
shall attain unto God; and through
your prayers I may be found a
disciple of Christ.

2  It will be very fit, O most
worthy Polycarp, to call a select
council, and choose some one
whom ye particularly love, and
who is patient of labour: that he
may be the messenger of God;
and that going unto Syria, he may
glorify your incessant love, to the
praise of Christ.

3  A Christian has not the power
of himself; but must be always
at leisure for God's service.
Now this work is both God's and
our's; when ye shall have
perfected it.

4  For I trust through the grace
of God that ye are ready to every
good work that is fitting for you
in the Lord.

5  Knowing therefore your
earnest affection for the truth,
I have exhorted you by these short
letters.

6  But forasmuch as I have not
been able to write to all the
churches, because I must suddenly
sail from Troas to Neapolis;
(for so is the command of those
to whose pleasure I am subject;)
do you write to the churches that
are near you, as being instructed
in the will of God, that they also
may do in like manner.

7  Let those that are able send
messengers; and let the rest send
their letters by those who shall be
sent by you: that you may be
glorified to all eternity,
of which you are worthy.

8  I salute all by name; particularly
the wife of Epitropus with all her
house and children. I salute Attalus
my well-beloved.

9  I salute him who shall be
thought worthy to be sent by you
into Syria. Let grace be ever
with him, and with Polycarp who
sends him.

10  I wish you all happiness in
our God, Jesus Christ; in whom
continue, in the unity and
protection of God.

beloved.  Farewell in the Lord.




              REFERENCES TO THE SEVEN EPISTLES OF IGNATIUS,

[The Epistles of Ignatius are translated by Archbishop Wake from the text
of Vossius. He says that there were considerable difference in the
editions; the  best for a long time extant containing fabrications, and
the genuine being altered and corrupted. Archbishop Usher printed old
Latin translations of  them at Oxford, in 1644. At Amsterdam, two years
afterwards, Vossius  printed six of them in their ancient and pure Greek;
and the seventh, greatly  amended from the ancient Latin version, was
Printed at Paris, by Ruinart, in 1689, in the Acts and Martyrdom of
Ignatius, from a Greek uninterpolated copy. These are supposed to form
the collection that Polycarp made of the Epistles of Ignatius, mentioned
by Irenaes, Origen, Eusebius, Jerome, Athanasius, Theodoret, and other
ancients: but many learned men have  imagined all of them to be
apocryphal. This supposition, the piety of Arch-bishop Wake, and his
persuasion of their utility to the faith of the church, will not permit
him to entertain: hence he has taken great pains to render the present
translation acceptable, by adding numerous readings and references to the
Canonical Books.]






                             THE EPISTLE OF
                      POLYCARP TO THE PHILIPPIANS.

     [The genuineness of this Epistle is controverted, but implicitly
     believed by Arch-bishop Wake, whose translation is below. There is
     also a translation by Dr. Cave attached to his life of Polycarp.]


CHAPTER I.

     Polycarp commends the Philippians for their respect to
     those who suffered for the Gospel; and for their own faith.

POLYCARP, and the presbyters
that are with him, to the
church of God which is at Philippi;
mercy unto you, and peace from
God Almighty, and the Lord Jesus
Christ our Saviour, be multiplied.

2  I rejoiced greatly with you
in our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye
received the images of a true love,
and accompanied, as it behoved you,
those who were in bonds, becoming
saints; which are the crowns of
such as are truly chosen by God
and our Lord:

3  As also that the root of the
faith which was preached from
ancient times, remains firm in you
to this day; and brings forth fruit
to our Lord Jesus Christ, who
suffered himself to be brought
even to the death for our sins:

4  Whom God hath raised up, having
loosed the pains of death. Whom
having not seen, ye love; in whom
though now ye see him not, yet
believing, ye rejoice with joy
unspeakable and full of glory.

5  Into which many desire to
enter; I knowing that by grace ye
are saved; not by works, but by
the will of God through Jesus
Christ.

6  Wherefore girding up the
loins of your minds; I serve
the Lord with fear, and in truth;
laying aside all empty and vain
speech, and the errors of many;
believing in him that raised up
our Lord Jesus Christ from the
dead, and hath given him glory
and a throne at his right hand.

7  To whom all things are made
subject, both that are in heaven,
and that are in earth; whom every
living creature shall worship;
who shall come to be the judge of
the quick and dead: whose blood
God shall require of them that
believe not in him.

8  But he that raised up Christ
from the dead, shall also raise up
us in like manner, if we do his
will, and walk according to his
commandments; and love those
things which he loved:

9  Abstaining from all
unrighteousness; inordinate affection,
and love of money; from evil.
speaking; false witness; not
rendering evil for evil, or
railing for railing, or striking
for striking, or cursing
for cursing:

10 But remembering what the
Lord has taught us saying, Judge
not, and ye shall not be judged;
forgive and ye shall be forgiven;
be ye merciful, and ye shall obtain
mercy; for with the same measure
that ye meet withal, it shall be
measured to you again.

11  And again; Blessed are the
poor, and they that are persecuted
for righteousness sake; for theirs
is the kingdom of God.



CHAPTER II.

     2 Exhorts to Faith, Hope, and Charity.
     5 Against covetousness, and as to the
     duties of husbands, wives, widows,
     9 deacons, young men, virgins, and presbyters.

THESE things, my brethren,
I took not the liberty of myself
to write unto you concerning
righteousness, but you yourselves
before encouraged me to it.

2  For neither can i, nor any
other such as I am, come up to
the wisdom of the blessed and
renowned Paul; who being himself
in person with those who then
lived, did with all exactness and
soundness teach the word of truth;
and being gone from you wrote an
epistle to you.

3  Into which if you look, you
will be able to edify yourselves in
the faith that has been delivered
unto you, which is the mother of
us all; being followed with hope,
and led on by a general love, both
towards God and towards Christ,
and towards our neighbour.

4  For if any man has these
things, he has fulfilled the law
of righteousness: for he that has
charity is far from all sin.

5  But the love of money is the
root of all evil. Knowing therefore
that as we brought nothing into this
world, so neither may we carry any
thing out; let us arm ourselves
with the armour of righteousness.

6  And teach ourselves first to
walk according to the commandments
of the Lord; and then your wives
to walk likewise according to the
faith that is given to them; in
charity, and in purity; loving
their own husbands, with all
sincerity, and all others alike,
with all temperance; and to bring up
their children in the instruction
and fear of the Lord.

7  The widows likewise teach
that they be sober as to what
concerns the faith of the Lord:
praying always for all men; being far
from all detraction, evil speaking,
false witness; from covetousness,
and from all evil.

8  Knowing that they are the
altars of God, who sees all blemishes,
and from whom nothing is hid; who
searches out the very reasonings,
and thoughts, and secrets of our
hearts.

9  Knowing therefore that God
is not mocked, we ought to walk
worthy both of his command and
of his glory.

10  Also the deacons must be
blameless before him, as the
ministers of God in Christ, and
not of men. Not false mousers, not
double tongued, not lovers of money;
but moderate in all things;
compassionate, careful; walking
according to the truth of the Lord,
who was the servant of all.

11  Whom if we please in this
present world, we shall also be
made partakers of that which is
to come, according as he has
promised to us, that he will raise
us from the dead; and that if we
shall walk worthy of him, we shall
also reign together with him, if
we believe.

12  In like manner the younger
men must be unblameable in all
things; above all, taking care of
their purity, and to restrain
themselves from all evil. For it is
good to be cut off from the lusts that
are in the world; because every
such lust warreth against the
spirit: and neither fornicators,
nor effeminate, nor abusers of
themselves with mankind, shall
inherit the kingdom of God; nor
they who do such things as are
foolish and unreasonable.

13  Wherefore ye must needs
abstain from all these things,
being subject to the priests and
deacons, as unto God and Christ.

14  The virgins admonish to
walk in a spotless and pure
conscience.

15  And let the elders be
compassionate and merciful towards
all; turning them from their errors;
seeking out those that are weak;
not forgetting the widows, the
fatherless, and the poor; but
always providing what is good
both in the sight of God and man.

16  Abstaining from all wrath,
respect of persons, and unrighteous
judgment; and especially being
free from all covetousness.

17  Not easy to believe anything
against any; not severe in judgment;
knowing that we are all debtors
in point of sin.

18 If therefore we pray to the
Lord that he would forgive us, we
ought also to forgive others; for
we are all in the sight of our Lord
and God; a and must all stand before
the judgment-seat of Christ;
and shall every one give an
account of himself.

19  Let us therefore serve him in
fear, and with all reverence as
both himself hath commanded;
and as the Apostles who have
preached the Gospel unto us, and
the prophets who have foretold
the coming of our Lord have
taught us:

20  Being zealous of what is
good; abstaining from all offence,
and from false brethren; and
from those who bear the name of
Christ in hypocrisy; who deceive
vain men.



CHAPTER III.

     1 As to faith in our Saviour Christ;
     his nature and sufferings, the resurrection and judgment.
     3 Exhorts to prayer
     5 and steadfastness in the faith, from the examples of Christ,
     7 and Apostles and saints, and exhorts to carefulness
     in all well-doing.

FOR whosoever does not confess
that Jesus Christ is come in
the flesh, he is Antichrist: and
whoever does not confess his
suffering upon the cross, is
from the devil.

2  And whosoever perverts the
oracles of the Lord to his own
lusts, and says that there shall.
neither be any resurrection, nor
judgment, he is the first-born of
Satan.

3  Wherefore leaving the vanity
of many, and their false doctrines;
let us return to the word that was
delivered to us from the beginning:
Watching unto prayer; and
persevering in fasting;

4  With supplication beseeching
the all seeing God not to lead us
into temptation; as the Lord hath
said, The spirit is truly willing,
but the flesh is weak.

5 Let us therefore without ceasing
hold steadfastly to him who is our
hope, and the earnest of our
righteousnes, even Jesus Christ;
Who, his own self, bare our sins
in his own body on the tree: who
did no sin, neither was guile found
in his mouth; but suffered all for
us that we might live through
him.

6  Let us therefore imitate his
patience; and if we suffer for his
name, let us glorify him; for this
example he has given us by himself,
and so have we believed.

7  Wherefore I exhort all
of you that ye obey the word of
righteousness, and exercise all
patience; which ye have seen set
forth before your eyes, not only
in the blessed Ignatius, and Zozimus,
and Rufus; but in others among
yourselves; and in Paul himself,
and the rest of the Apostles:

8  Being confident of this, that
all these have not run in vain, but
in faith and righteousness; and
are gone to the place that was due
to them from the Lord; with
whom also they suffered.

9  For they loved not this
present world; but him who died,
and was raised again by God for
us.

10  Stand therefore in these
things, and follow the example of
the Lord; being firm and immutable
in the faith, lovers of the
brotherhood, lovers of one
another: companions together
in the truth, being kind and
gentle towards each other,
despising none.

11  When it is in your power to
do good defer it not, for charity
delivered from death.

12  Be all of you subject one to
another, having your conversation
honest among the Gentiles; that
by your good works, both ye
yourselves may receive praise, and
the Lord may not be blasphemed
through you.   But woe be to him
by whom the name of the Lord is
blasphemed.

13  Therefore teach all men
sobriety; in which do ye also
exercise yourselves.



CHAPTER IV.

     Valens, a presbyter, having fallen into the sin
     of covetousness, he exhorts them against it.

I am greatly afflicted for Valens,
who was once a presbyter among you;
that he should so little understand
the place that was given to him in
the church, Wherefore I admonish you
that ye abstain from covetousness;
and that ye be chaste, and true of
speech.

2  Keep yourselves from all evil.
For he that in these things cannot
govern himself, how shall he be
able to prescribe them to another?

3  If a man does not keep himself
from covetousness, he shall be
polluted with idolatry, and be
judged as if he were a Gentile.

4  But who of you are ignorant
of the judgment of God?  Do we
not know that the saints shall
judge the world, as Paul teaches?

5  But I have neither perceived
nor heard anything of this kind
in you, among whom the blessed
Paul laboured; and who are
named in the beginning of his
Epistle.

6  For he glories of you in all
the churches who then only knew
God; for we did not then know
him. Wherefore, my brethren, I
am exceedingly sorry both for him
and for his wife; to whom God
grant a true repentance.

7  And be ye also moderate upon
this occasion; and look not upon
such as enemies, but call them
back as suffering and erring
members, that ye may save your
whole body: for by so doing,
ye shall edify your own selves.

8  For I trust that ye are well
exercised in the Holy Scriptures,
and that nothing is hid from you
but at present it is not granted
unto me to practise that which is
written, Be angry and sin not;
and again, Let not the sun go
down upon your wrath.

9  Blessed be he that believeth
and remembereth these things;
which also I trust you do.

10  Now the God and Father of
our Lord Jesus Christ, and he
himself who is our everlasting
high-priest, the Son of God, even
Jesus Christ, build you up in faith
and in truth, and in all meekness
and lenity; in patience and long-
suffering, in forbearance and
chastity:

11  And grant unto you a lot and
portion among his saints, and us
with you; and to all that are under
the heavens, who shall believe in
our Lord Jesus Christ, and in his
Father who raised him from the dead.

12  Pray for all the saints:
pray also for kings, and all that
are in authority; and for those who
persecute you, and hate you, and for
the enemies of the cross; that your
fruit may be manifest in all; and
that ye may be perfect in Christ.

13  Ye wrote to me, both ye, and
also Ignatius, that if any one
went from hence into Syria, he
should bring your letters with
him; which also I will take care
of, as soon as I shall have a
convenient opportunity; either
by myself, or him whom I shall
send upon your account.

14  The Epistle of Ignatius,
which he wrote unto us, together
with what others of his have come
to our hands, we have sent to you,
according to your order; which
are subjoined to this Epistle:

15  By which we may be greatly
profited; for they treat of faith
and patience, and of all things that
pertain to edification in the Lord
Jesus.

16  What you know certainly of
Ignatius, and those that are
with him, signify to us.

17  These things have I written
unto you by Crescens, whom by
this present Epistle I have
recommended to you, and do now
again commend.

18  For he has had his conversation
without blame among us; and I suppose
also with you.

19  Ye will also have regard unto
his sister when she shall come
unto you.

20 Be ye safe in the Lord Jesus
Christ; and in favour with all
yours. Amen.

of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
