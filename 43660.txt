_PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION._

It is now thirteen years since the first edition of the following text of
this important poem was published by the late Mr. Pickering, during which
time the study of our old literature and history has undergone considerable
development, and it is believed that a reprint at a more moderate price
would be acceptable to the public. Holding still the same opinion which he
has always held with regard to the superior character of the manuscript
from which this text was taken, the editor has done no more than carefully
reprint it, but, in order to make it as useful as he could, he has revised
and made additions to both the Notes and the Glossary.

The remarkable poem of The Vision of Piers Ploughman is not only so
interesting a monument of the English language and literature, but it is
also so important an illustration of the political history of our country
during the fourteenth century, that it deserves to be read far more
generally than it has been, and the editor will rejoice sincerely if he
should have contributed by this new edition to render it more popular, and
place it within the reach of a greater number of readers. Independent of
its historical and literary importance, it contains many beauties which
will fully repay the slight labour required to master its partially
obsolete language, and, as one of the purest works in the English tongue as
it existed during the century in which it was composed, it is to be hoped
that, when the time shall at length arrive when English antiquities and
English philology and literary history are at length to be made a part of
the studies in our universities and in the higher classes of our schools,
the work of the Monk of Malvern, as a link between the poetry and language
of the Anglo-Saxon and those of modern England, will be made a prominent
text-book.

_INTRODUCTION._

The History of the Middle Ages in England, as in other countries,
represents to us a series of great consecutive political movements,
coexistent with a similar series of intellectual revolutions in the mass of
the people. The vast mental development caused by the universities in the
twelfth century led the way for the struggle to obtain religious and
political liberty in the thirteenth. The numerous political songs of that
period which have escaped the hand of time, and above all the mass of
satirical ballads against the Church of Rome, which commonly go under the
name of Walter Mapes, are remarkable monuments of the intellectual history
of our forefathers. Those ballads are written in Latin; for it was the most
learned class of the community which made the first great stand against the
encroachments and corruptions of the papacy and the increasing influence of
the monks. We know that the struggle alluded to was historically
unsuccessful. The baronial wars ended in the entire destruction of the
popular leaders; but their cause did not expire at Evesham; they had laid
foundations which no storm could overthrow, not placed hastily on the
uncertain surface of popular favour, but fixed deeply in the public mind.
The barons, who had fought so often and so staunchly for the great charter,
had lost their power; even the learning of the universities had faded under
the withering grasp of monachism; but the remembrance of the old contest
remained, and what was more, its literature was left, the songs which had
spread abroad the principles for which, or against which, Englishmen had
fought, carried them down (a precious legacy) to their posterity. Society
itself had undergone an important change; it was no longer a feudal
aristocracy which held the destinies of the country in its iron hand. The
plant which had been cut off took root again in another (a healthier) soil;
and the intelligence which had lost its force in the higher ranks of
society began to spread itself among the commons. Even in the thirteenth
century, before the close of the baronial wars, the complaints so
vigorously expressed in the Latin songs, had begun, both in England and
France, to appear in the language of the people. Many of the satirical
poems of Rutebeuf and other contemporary writers against the monks, are
little more than translations of the Latin poems which go under the name of
Walter Mapes.

During the successive reigns of the first three Edwards, the public mind in
England was in a state of constant fermentation. On the one hand, the
monks, supported by the popish church, had become an incubus upon the
country. Their corruptness and immorality were notorious: the description
of their vices given in the satirical writings of the thirteenth and
fourteenth centuries exceeds even the bitterest calumnies of the age of
Rabelais or the reports of the commissioners of Henry the Eighth.[1] The
populace, held in awe by the imposing appearance of the popish church, and
by the religious belief which had been instilled into them from their
infancy, were opposed to the monks and clergy by a multitude of personal
griefs and jealousies: these frequently led to open hostility, and in the
chronicles of those days we read of the slaughter of monks, and the burning
of abbeys, by the insurgent towns-people or peasantry. At the same time,
while the monks in revenge treated the commons with contempt, there were
numerous people who, under the name of Lollards and other such
appellations,--led sometimes by the love of mischief and disorder, but more
frequently by religious enthusiasm,--whose doctrines were simple and
reasonable (although the church would fain have branded them all with the
title of heretics),--went abroad among the people preaching not only
against the corruptions of the monks, but against the most vital doctrines
of the church of Rome, and, as might be expected, they found abundance of
listeners. On the other hand, a new political system, and the
embarrassments of a continued series of foreign wars, were adding to the
general ferment. Instead of merely calling together the great feudal barons
to lead their retainers to battle, the king was now obliged to appeal more
directly to the people; and at the same time the latter began to feel the
weight of taxation, and consequently they began to talk of the defects and
the corruptions of the government, and to raise the cries, which have since
so often been heard, against the king's "evil advisers." These cries were
justified by many real and great oppressions under which the commons, and
more particularly the peasantry, suffered; and (as the king and aristocracy
were too much interested in the continuance of the abuses complained of to
be easily induced to agree to an effective remedy), the commons began to
feel that their own interests were equally opposed to those of the church,
of the aristocracy, and of the crown, and amidst the other popular
doctrines none were more loudly or more violently espoused than those of
levellers and democrats. These, though comparatively few, aggravated the
evil, by affording a pretence for persecution. The history of England
during the fourteenth century is a stirring picture; its dark side is the
increasing corruption of the popish church; its bright side, the general
spread of popular intelligence, and the firm stand made by the commons in
the defence of their liberties, and in the determination to obtain a
redress of grievances.

Under these circumstances appeared PIERS PLOUGHMAN. It is not to be
supposed that all the other classes of society were hostile to the commons.
The people, with the characteristic attachment of the Anglo-Saxons to the
family of their princes, wished to believe that their king was always their
friend, when not actuated by the counsels of his "evil advisers;"[2]
several of the most powerful barons stood forward as the champions of
popular liberty; and many of the monks quitted their monasteries to
advocate the cause of the reformation. It appears to be generally agreed
that a monk was the author of the poem of Piers Ploughman; but the
question, one perhaps but of secondary importance, as to its true writer,
is involved in much obscurity.[3] Several local allusions and other
circumstances seem to prove that it was composed on the borders of Wales,
where had originated most of the great political struggles, and we can
hardly doubt that its author resided in the neighbourhood of "Malverne
hilles." We have less difficulty in ascertaining its date. At ll.
1735-1782, we have, without doubt, an allusion to the treaty of Bretigny,
in 1360, and to the events which preceded it: in the earlier part of this
passage there is an allusion to the sufferings of the English army in the
previous winter campaign, to the retreat which followed, and the want of
provisions which accompanied it, and to the tempest which they encountered
near Chartres (the "dym cloude" of the poem). The "pestilences" mentioned
at l. 2497 were the great plague which happened in 1348-9 (and which had
previously been alluded to in the opening of the poem, l. 168), and that of
1361-2,--the first two of the three great pestilences which devastated our
island in the fourteenth century. The south-western wind, mentioned in l.
2500, occurred on the fifteenth day of January 1362. It is probable that
the poem of Piers Ploughman was composed in the latter part of this year,
when the effects of the great wind were fresh in people's memory, and when
the treaty of Bretigny had become a subject of popular discontent.[4]

The poem was given to the world under a name which could not fail to draw
the attention of the people. Amid the oppressive injustice of the great and
the vices of their idle retainers, the corruptions of the clergy, and the
dishonesty which too frequently characterised the dealings of merchants and
traders, the simple unsophisticated heart of the ploughman is held forth as
the dwelling of virtue and truth. It was the ploughman, and not the pope
with his proud hierarchy, who represented on earth the Saviour who had
descended into this world as the son of the carpenter, who had lived a life
of humility, who had wandered on foot or ridden on an ass. "While God
wandered on earth," says one of the political songs of the beginning of the
fourteenth century,[5] "what was the reason that he would not ride?" The
answer expresses the whole force of the popular sentiment of the age:
"because he would not have a retinue of greedy attendants by his side, in
the shape of grooms and servants, to insult and oppress the peasantry."

At the period when this poem was first published, England, in common with
the rest of Europe, had been struck with a succession of calamities. Little
more than twelve years had passed since a terrible pestilence had swept
away perhaps not less than one-half of the population.[6] The lower
classes, ill fed and neglected, perished by thousands, while the higher
ranks--the proud and pampered nobility--escaped; "he who was ill nourished
with unsubstantial food," says a contemporary writer, "fell before the
slightest breath of the destroyer; to the poor, death was welcome, for life
is to them more cruel than death. But death respected princes, nobles,
knights, judges, gentlemen; of these few die, because their life is one of
enjoyment."[7] It was the general belief that this fearful visitation had
been sent by God as a punishment for the sins which had more particularly
characterised the higher orders of society; yet instead of profiting by the
warning, they became, during the years which followed, prouder, more cruel
and oppressive, and more licentious, than before. Another pestilence came,
which visited the classes that had before escaped, and at the same time a
tempest such as had seldom been witnessed seemed to announce the vengeance
of heaven. The streets and roads were filled with zealots who preached and
prophesied of other misfortunes, to people who had scarcely recovered from
the terror of those which were past. At this moment the satirist stepped
forth, and laid open with unsparing knife the sins and corruptions which
provoked them.

From what has been said, it will be seen that the Latin poems attributed to
Walter Mapes, and the Collection of Political Songs, form an introduction
to the Vision of Piers Ploughman. It seems clear that the writer was well
acquainted with the former, and that he not unfrequently imitates them. The
Poem on the Evil Times of Edward II. already alluded to (in the Political
Songs) contains within a small compass all his chief points of accusation
against the different orders of society. But a new mode of composition had
been brought into fashion since the appearance of the famous "Roman de la
Rose," and the author makes his attacks less directly, under an allegorical
clothing. The condition of society is revealed to the writer in a dream, as
in the singular poem just mentioned, and as in the still older satire, the
_Apocalypsis Goliae_; but in Piers Ploughman the allegory follows no
systematic plot, it is rather a succession of pictures in which the
allegorical painting sometimes disappears altogether, than a whole like the
Roman de la Rose, and it is on that account less tedious to the modern
reader, while the vigorous descriptions, the picturesque ideas, and
numerous other beauties of different kinds, cause us to lose sight of the
general defects of this class of writings.

Piers Ploughman is, in fact, rather a succession of dreams, than one simple
vision. The dreamer, weary of the world, falls asleep beside a stream amid
the beautiful scenery of Malvern Hills. In his vision, the people of the
world are represented to him by a vast multitude assembled in a fair
meadow; on one side stands the tower of Truth, elevated on a mountain, the
right aim of man's pilgrimage, while on the other side is the dungeon of
Care, the dwelling place of Wrong. In the first sections (_passus_) of the
poem are pictured the origin of society, the foundation and dignity of
kingly power, and the separation into different classes and orders. In the
midst of his astonishment at what he sees, a fair lady, the personification
of "holy church," approaches, to instruct the dreamer. She explains to him
the meaning of the different objects which had presented themselves to his
view, and shows by exhortations and examples the merit of content and
moderation, the danger of disobedience (exemplified in the story of
Lucifer's fall), and the efficacy of love and charity. In the midst of his
conversation with his instructor, a lady makes her appearance on the scene.
This is lady Mede, the personification of that mistaken object at which so
large a portion of mankind direct their aim--the origin of most of the
corruptions and evil deeds in the world--not the just remuneration of our
actions which we look forward to in a future life, but the reward which is
sought by those who set all their hopes on the present. Holy Church now
quits the dreamer, who is left to observe what is taking place amid the
crowd in the field. (_Passus II._) They all pay their court to lady Mede,
who, by the intermediation of Cyvyle, or the law, is betrothed in marriage
to Falsehood. The marriage is forbidden by Theology, and Cyvyle agrees to
carry the cause to London for judgment, contrary to the desire of Simony.
Falsehood and Flattery bribe the lawyers to aid the former in his suit, but
their designs are baffled by Conscience, at whose suggestion the king takes
the lady into his own custody, and drives away Falsehood and his greedy
followers. Mede soon finds favour at court (_Passus III._), and especially
with the friars, who are ready to absolve her of all her sins for a proper
consideration. The king proposes to marry her to Conscience; who, however,
declines the match, and as a reason for his refusal gives a very
unfavourable picture of the lady's previous life and private character.
Mede defends herself, and accuses Conscience of thwarting and opposing the
will and designs of kings and great people. The dispute becoming hot, the
king interferes and orders Mede and Conscience to be reconciled and kiss
each other. (_Passus IV._) This Conscience refuses to do, unless by the
advice of Reason; on whose arrival, Peace comes into the parliament to make
his complaint against the cruel oppressions of Wrong. Wrong is condemned,
but Mede and the lawyers attempt to get him off with the payment of a sum
of money. The king, however, allows himself to be guided by Reason and
Conscience, expresses his dissatisfaction that law is influenced by Mede,
and his determination to govern his realm by the counsel of Reason.

In a second vision (_Passus V._), the dreamer is again carried to the
"field full of folk," where Reason has taken upon himself the character of
a preacher, and, fortified with the king's authority, induces the various
classes of sinners to confess and repent. The personification of the
different sins forms perhaps the most remarkable part of the whole poem.
The multitude being thus converted from their evil courses, are persuaded
by Repentance and Hope to set out on a pilgrimage in search of Truth. In
their ignorance of the path which they must follow in this search, they
apply to a palmer who had wandered over a large portion of the world in
search of different saints; but they find him as little acquainted with the
way as themselves. They are helped out of this dilemma by Piers the
Ploughman, who, seeing them terrified by the difficulties of the road,
offers to be their guide, if they will wait till he has sown his half acre.
(_Passus VI._) In the mean time all the pilgrims who have strength and
skill, are employed on some useful works, except the knight, who
undertakes, in return for the support which he is to derive from the
ploughman's labours, to watch and protect him against plunderers and
foreign enemies. The peace of the labourers is first disturbed by Waster,
who refuses to perform the conditions by which the others are bound: the
aid of the knight being found inefficient against this turbulent gentleman,
the Ploughman is obliged to send for Hunger, who effectually humbles him.
This section of the poem is a continued allusion to the effects of the
famine and pestilence, and a satire upon the luxurious and extravagant life
of our forefathers in the fourteenth century. (_Passus VII._) Truth,
hearing of the intentions of Piers the Ploughman to leave his labours in
order to serve as a guide to the pilgrims in their journey, sends him a
messenger, exhorting him to remain at home and continue his labours, and
giving him a "pardon" which was to embrace all those who aided him
honestly, by their works, and who should carry on their various avocations
in purity of heart. The writer here takes occasion to sneer at the
"pardons" of the pope, then so much in vogue; a priest questions the
legitimacy of Piers' bull of pardon, and the altercation between them
becomes so loud that the dreamer awakes. The pardon of Piers Ploughman is
granted to those who do good works: the dreamer is lost in the speculation
on the question as to what the good works are, and he becomes engaged in a
new pilgrimage, in search of a person who has not appeared
before,--Do-well.

(_Passus VIII._) All his inquiries after Do-well are fruitless: even the
friars, to whom he addresses himself, give but a confused account; and,
weary with wandering about, the dreamer is again overtaken by slumber.
Thought now appears to him, and recommends him to Wit, who describes to him
the residence of Do-well, Do-better, and Do-best, and enumerates their
companions and attendants. (_Passus IX._) The Castle of Do-well is an
allegorical representation of man (the individual), in which lady Anima
(the soul) is placed for safety, and guarded by a keeper named Kynde
(nature). With Do-well, the representative of those who live according to
truth in honest wedlock, are contrasted the people who live in lust and
wickedness, the descendants of the murderer Cain, who was begotten by Adam
in an evil hour. (_Passus X._) Wit has a wife named lady Study, who is
angry that her spouse should lay open his high truths to those who are
uninitiated--it is no better than "throwing pearls to swine, which would
rather have hawes." Wit is daunted by his wife's long lecture, and leaves
the dreamer to pursue his own suit. This he does with so much meekness and
humility, that the wrath of dame Study is appeased, and she sends him to
Clergy, with a token of recommendation from herself. Clergy receives the
pilgrim, and entertains him with a long declamation on the character of
Do-well, Do-better, and Do-best, and on the corruptions of the church and
the monkish orders, in the course of which is uttered the remarkable
prophecy of the king who was to "confess and beat" the monks, and give them
an "incurable knock," which was after less than two centuries so exactly
fulfilled in the dissolution of the monasteries. The wanderer confesses
himself "little the wiser" for Clergy's lecture, and by his pertness of
reply merits a reproof from Scripture. (_Passus XI._) In another vision the
dreamer is exposed to the seductions of Fortune, whose two fair damsels,
Concupiscentia-carnis and Covetousness-of-the-Eyes, persuade him to enjoy
the present moment, and lead him entirely from his previous pursuit. He is
only recalled from his error by the approach of Old Age, and then he falls
into the contemplation of a series of subjects, the covetousness of the
friars who gave absolution from motives of personal interest,
predestination, &c. Then Kynde, or Nature, came and carried him to a
mountain, which represented the world, and there showed him how all other
animals but man followed Reason; and Imaginative came after, and told him
that all his present doubt and anxiety had been brought upon him for
contending with Reason and suffering himself to be led astray by Fortune.
(_Passus XII._) The whole of the next section of the poem is occupied with
a long exhortation by Imaginative, concerning God's chastisements, the
merits of Charity and Mercy, the greater responsibility before God of those
who are learned and cannot sin ignorantly, the difficulty for the rich man
to enter heaven.

(_Passus XIII._) In another vision, Conscience meets with the dreamer, and
takes him to dine with Clergy. Patience comes to the feast in beggar's
weeds, but is seated in the most honourable place at the table. A doctor of
the church is of the party, and distinguishes himself by his gluttony; and
by discussing theological questions after dinner. At length Conscience and
Patience go on a pilgrimage. In their way they meet with a minstrel, named
Activa Vita, or Haukyn the Active-man, with a coat covered with spots of
dirt, whom they question on his mode of life. (_Passus XIV._) Haukyn the
Active-man, the representative of that class of people who neglect their
souls for their worldly affairs, excuses the dirtiness of his apparel on
the ground that he has none to change, and that he has too many occupations
to allow him time to have it cleaned. Conscience and Patience teach him a
method to clean his coat, inform him where charity is to be found, and
recommend patient poverty to him, showing him the advantage of poverty over
riches. Haukyn's repentance and lamentation for the neglect of his duties
awake the dreamer.

(_Passus XV._) Amid his anxiety to know something more certain of Do-well,
the dreamer has another vision, in which Soul appears to him, and enters
into a long relation of the corruptions and negligence of the clergy.
(_Passus XVI._) Soul finally sends him to Piers the Ploughman, who
possesses the garden in which the tree of Charity grows, and which is
rented under him by Free-will. Piers explains to him the nature of the
tree, and of the props which support it; and shakes down some of the fruit
for him. The allegory then changes, and we are introduced to the birth and
passion of the Saviour, as arising out of the fruit of Charity. At this
moment the dreamer awakes, and therewith loses sight of Piers the
Ploughman; in his anxiety to find Piers, he meets with Faith, in the garb
of Abraham, who was in search of God, now incarnate, and who waited for his
passion in order to be delivered from hell. (_Passus XVII._) Then comes
Spes, or Hope, who also was in search of the knight that was to vanquish
the evil one. As they go along the way towards Jerusalem to the "justes,"
discoursing on the obligations of the old and new law and the abrogation of
the former, they meet with a man who had been left helpless by thieves,
wounded and naked: Faith and Hope passed by without helping him, but the
Samaritan, who was also riding to the "justes," descended from his horse,
bound his wounds, and deposited him in an inn at the grange named _Lex
Christi_. The Samaritan gives the dreamer a singular explanation of the
mysteries of the Trinity; and, after having represented to him the
heinousness of sins against the different persons, and the necessity of
making reparation, he pursues his way to Jerusalem.

(_Passus XVIII._) The vision which forms the eighteenth section or
_passus_, and in which the character of Piers the Ploughman is identified
with that of the Saviour, is entirely occupied with an allegorical
description of Christ's Passion, and his descent into Hell. (_Passus XIX._)
In the next section the history of Christ's passion and victory, and his
figurative representative Piers the Ploughman, is continued. Grace, through
Piers the Ploughman, descends upon the people, and lays the foundation of
the Church, which is cultivated by Piers with his four oxen (the four
Evangelists). Piers is attacked by Pride, who gathers a great host to
assail the Church. Conscience advises the people who follow Piers (the
Church), to take shelter in the stronghold of Unity, and make preparations
for their defence. By the counsel of Kind-wit and Conscience they dig a
great ditch around Unity. The measures of Surety are embarrassed by the
unreasonable opposition of some members or parts of the community, who
oppose Pier's doctrine of restitution--the brewer will not repent of the
tricks which he puts on his customers, the vicar adheres to his simony, the
lord will continue to oppress his tenants, and the king will not be
restrained by his laws. (__Passus XX.__) In the last section of the poem,
the dreamer, after having been accosted by Need, who preaches on the
virtues of temperance, has a vision of Antichrist, who comes to attack the
Castle of Unity. It must be remembered that at this period many people
supposed that Antichrist was already on the earth, and that he was the
cause of all the evils with which mankind was then visited, so that this
last notion brought the allegory home to people's feelings. The
standard-bearer of Antichrist was Pride. Conscience called Kynde, or
Nature, to his aid, who brought an army of diseases and pestilences. Death,
one of his chief soldiers, made terrible havoc. At length Kynde ceased his
ravages; and a horde of enemies immediately arose against Conscience, such
as Fortune, Lechery, Covetousness, Simony. Life, with his mistress Fortune,
indulged in all kinds of excess, until he was visited by Age and Despair,
who treated him very roughly. The dreamer, forsaken by Fortune, and
participating in the misfortunes of Life, by the advice of Kynde takes
shelter with Conscience in the castle of Unity, which is threatened by an
army of priests and monks. At length this stronghold is endangered by the
entrance of Flattery, who is admitted in the disguise of a Physician.
Conscience, unable to retain possession, embarks upon another pilgrimage in
search of Piers the Ploughman, and the dreamer awakes. This is the
conclusion of the poem. Whitaker thought that it should have had a more
consoling end; but it must be remembered that the writer of Piers Ploughman
designed to paint the world as it was, and to describe the numerous
obstacles which lay in the way of the improvement and amelioration of
mankind when he wrote.

While one member of the monastic order was thus contributing by his
satirical pen towards producing a reform among his countrymen, another monk
was beginning to preach in a still bolder manner against the popish system.
This was John Wycliffe, under whom the despised lollards became an
important sect. This attempt at religious reformation only formed part of
the great movement of the fourteenth century, which soon afterwards broke
out in the popular commotions of the reign of Richard II. The writer of
Piers Ploughman was neither a sower of sedition, nor one who would be
characterised by his contemporaries as a heretic. The doctrines inculcated
throughout the book are so far from democratic, that he constantly preaches
the Christian doctrine of obedience to rulers. Yet its tendency to debase
the great, and to raise the commons in public consideration, must have
rendered it popular among the latter: and, although no single important
doctrine of the popish religion is attacked, yet the unsparing manner in
which the vices and corruptions of the church are laid open, must have
helped in no small degree the cause of the Reformation. Of the ancient
popularity of Piers Ploughman we have a proof in the great number of copies
which still exist, most of them written in the latter part of the
fourteenth century; and the circumstance that the manuscripts are seldom
executed in a superior style of writing, and scarcely ever ornamented with
painted initial letters, may perhaps be taken as a proof that they were not
written for the higher classes of society. From the time when it was
published, the name of Piers Ploughman became a favourite among the popular
reformers.[8] The earliest instance of the adoption of that name for
another satirical work is found in the Creed of Piers Ploughman, printed
also in the present volume, and in which even the form of verse of the
Vision is imitated.

In this latter poem, which was undoubtedly written by a Wycliffite, Piers
Ploughman is no longer an allegorical personage--he is the simple
representative of the peasant rising up to judge and act for himself--the
English _sans-culotte_ of the fourteenth century, if we may be allowed the
comparison. When it was written, a period of great excitement had passed
since the age of Langlande, the reputed author of the Vision--a period
characterised by the turbulence of the peasantry--which had witnessed in
France the fearful insurrection of the _Jacquerie_, and in England the
rebellion of Wat Tyler and Jack Straw.[9]

In Piers Ploughman's Creed it is the church simply, and not the state,
which is the object of attack. The clergy--and more particularly the
monks--are accused of having falsified religion, and of being actuated
solely by worldly passions--pride, covetousness, self-love. The writer,
placing himself in the position of one who has just learnt the first
grounds of religious knowledge, is anxious to find a person capable of
instructing him in his creed, and with this object he addresses himself to
the different orders of friars. He applies first to the Minorites, who
abuse the Carmelites, and pride themselves in their own holiness. Disgusted
with their jealousies and self-sufficiency, the inquirer seeks the
Preachers, or Dominicans; amid their stately buildings, and under their
sleek and well filled skins, he finds the same want of Christian charity:
their pride drives him to the order of St. Austin. The Austin Friars, as
well as the Carmelites, will only instruct him for money, and, shocked at
their covetousness, he continues his wanderings, until at last he meets
with a poor Ploughman, in whom he finds the charity and knowledge after
which he has been seeking. The Ploughman enters into a bitter attack on the
vices of all the four orders of friars: he describes their spirit of
persecution, exemplified in the case of Wycliffe and others, and their
simony; speaks of Wycliffe and Walter Brute as preachers of the truth; and
finishes by teaching the inquirer his simple creed.

The Creed of Piers Ploughman was written by one who approved the opinions
of Wycliffe, and it seems to have been carefully proscribed. There does not
appear to exist any manuscript older than the first printed edition.

The great popularity of the Vision of Piers Ploughman in the fourteenth
century, and its political influence, are proved by another close
imitation, which was composed immediately after the capture, and previous
to the deposition, of king Richard II. This poem also appears to have been
proscribed, and we have only a fragment left, which was printed from an
unique manuscript for the Camden Society. It also is composed in
alliterative verse, and its meaning is rendered obscure by a confused
allegorical style. It was evidently written towards the Welsh Border,
perhaps at Bristol, which is mentioned in the opening lines; and it appears
to have been intended as a continuation of, or as a sequel to, Piers
Ploughman, which it immediately follows in the only manuscript in which it
is preserved.

Another early poem, of which the Ploughman is the hero, was inserted in the
works of Chaucer under the title of the Ploughman's Tale. This, like the
Creed, is free from allegory; and it differs from the others also in being
written in rhyme, and not in alliterative verse. The Ploughman's Tale was
probably written in the earlier half of the fifteenth century.[10] It is a
coarse attack on the different orders of the clergy, for their pride,
covetousness, and other vices. Its versification has little merit; and
there appears to be no good reason for inserting it among the Canterbury
Tales.

The vision of Piers Ploughman appears to have continued to enjoy a wide
popularity down to the middle of the fifteenth century. We hear nothing of
it from that period to the middle of the sixteenth, when it was printed by
the reformers, and received with so much favour, that no less than three
editions, or rather three impressions, are said to have been sold in the
course of one year. Another edition was printed at the beginning of the
reign of Queen Elizabeth; and it appears to have been much read in the
latter part of the sixteenth century, and even at the beginning of the
seventeenth. The name of Piers Ploughman is not uncommon in the political
tracts of that period.[11]

The Poem of Piers Ploughman is peculiarly a national work. It is the most
remarkable monument of the public spirit of our forefathers in the middle,
or, as they are often termed, dark ages. It is a pure specimen of the
English language at a period when it had sustained few of the corruptions
which have disfigured it since we have had writers of "Grammars;" and in it
we may study with advantage many of the difficulties of the language which
these writers have misunderstood. It is, moreover, the finest example left
of the kind of versification which was purely English, inasmuch as it had
been the only one in use among our Anglo-Saxon progenitors, in common with
the other people of the North. To many readers it will be perhaps necessary
to explain that rhyming verse was not in use among the Anglo-Saxons. In
place of rhyme, they had a system of verse of which the characteristic was
a very regular _alliteration_, so arranged that, in every couplet, there
should be two principal words in the first line beginning with the same
letter, which letter must also be the initial of the first word on which
the stress of the voice falls in the second line. There has, as yet, been
discovered no system of foot-measure in Anglo-Saxon verse, but the common
metre consists apparently in having two rises and two falls of the voice in
each line. These characteristics are accurately preserved in the verse of
Piers Ploughman; and the measure appears to be the same, if we make
allowance for the change of the slow and impressive pronunciation of the
Anglo-Saxon for the quicker pronunciation of Middle English, which
therefore required a greater number of syllables to fill up the same space
of time.

We can trace the history of alliterative verse in England with tolerable
certainty. The Anglo-Normans first brought in rhymes, which they employed
in their own poetry. The adoption of this new system into the English
language was gradual, but it appears to have commenced in the first half of
the twelfth century. It was, at first, mixed with alliterative couplets:
that is, in the same poem were used sometimes rhyming couplets, which were
suddenly changed for alliterative couplets, and then, after awhile, rhyme
was again brought in, and so on. Of this kind of poetry we have four very
remarkable examples, the _Proverbs of King Alfred_, a poem which was
certainly in existence in the first half of the twelfth century;[12] the
_Early English Bestiary_;[13] the Poem on the _Debate between the Body and
the Soul_;[14] and the grand work of Layamon.[15] The following lines from
the Bestiary may serve as a specimen of the manner in which the two systems
are intermixed; they form part of the account of the spider:--

  "dhanne _r_ennedh ge _r_apelike,
  for ge is ai _r_edi,
  _n_imedh anon to dhe _n_et,
  and _n_imedh hem dhere,
  _b_itterlike ge hem _b_it
  and here _b_ane wurdhedh,
  _d_repedh and _d_rinkedh hire _blod_,
  _d_odh ge hire non odher _god_,
  bute fret hire _fille_,
  and daredh sidhen _stille_."
    .    .    .    .    .    .
  "Cethegrande is a _fis_
  dhe moste dhat in water _is_;
  dhat tu wuldes seien _get_,
  gef dhu it soge wan it _flet_," etc.

This kind of poetry appears to have been common until the middle of the
thirteenth century; after which period we only find alliteration in songs,
not used in simple alliterative couplets, but mixed up in the same lines
with rhyme in an irregular and playful manner.[16] But there appears little
room for doubting that during the whole of this time the pure alliterative
poetry was in use among the lower classes of society; and its revival
towards the middle of the fourteenth century appears to have been a part of
the political movement which then took place. In this point of view, the
poem of Piers Ploughman becomes still more worthy of attention as a
document of contemporary literary history. The old alliterative verse came
so much into fashion at this period that it was adopted for the composition
of long romances, of which several still remain.[17] The use of this kind
of verse was continued in the fifteenth century, and was imitated in
Scotland as late as the time of Dunbar, but the later writers were
evidently unacquainted with the strict rules of this species of
composition.

The Anglo-Saxons, who used this kind of verse only, wrote their poetry
invariably as prose. But the scribe was in the habit of indicating the
division of the lines by a dot. Among modern scholars a question has arisen
as to the propriety of printing the alliterative couplet in two short
lines, or in one long one. It appears to me that the mode in which the dot
is used in the manuscripts decides the question in favour of the short
lines. The manner in which the alliterative couplet is intermixed with the
rhyming couplet in the poems of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries (which
also are written in the manuscripts in the same form as prose), seems to me
a strong confirmation of this opinion; at least in these last-mentioned
cases, the verse must have been considered as written in short lines. As
the scribes quitted the custom of writing poetry in their manuscripts as
prose, with the divisions of lines indicated by dots, to adopt that of
arranging them in lines as we do at present, these short lines were found
very inconvenient because they were obliged either to waste a great deal of
parchment, or to write in several narrow columns. To remedy this, they fell
perhaps gradually into the custom of writing the two parts of the
alliterative couplet in one line, always, however, marking the division by
a dot. They followed the same method with the shorter rhyming lines, as is
the case with the old English Metrical Romance of Horn in a manuscript in
the Harleian Collection.[18] All the alliterative poetry of the fourteenth
and fifteenth centuries is found written in these long lines, with the dot
of division in the middle. In the fifteenth century the meaning of this dot
appears to have been forgotten, and the system of alliteration so far
misunderstood, that the writers thought it only necessary to have _at
least_ three alliterative words in a long line, without any consideration
of their position in the line. I say _at least_, because they not
unfrequently inserted four or five alliterative words in the same line,
which would certainly have been considered a defect in the earlier writers.
It is my opinion, that a modern editor is wrong in printing the verses of
Piers Ploughman in long lines, as they stand in the manuscripts, unless he
profess to give them as a fac-simile of the manuscripts themselves, or he
plead the same excuse of convenience from the shape of his book. In either
case, he must carefully preserve the dots of separation in the middle of
the lines, which are more inconvenient than the length of the lines,
because they interfere with the punctuation of the modern editor. If, as
appears to be the case, these dots are merely marks to indicate the
division of the couplet, their purpose is much better served by printing
the lines in couplets. The construction of the earlier Anglo-Saxon verse,
the analogy of the mixed rhyming and alliterative verses of the semi-Saxon
poems, and the use of these dots in the middle of the lines in the
manuscripts of Piers Ploughman, appear to me convincing proofs that it
ought to be printed so. I think moreover that the alliterative verse reads
much more harmoniously in the short couplets than in the long lines.

The manuscripts of the Vision of Piers Ploughman are extremely numerous
both in public and in private collections. There are at least eight in the
British Museum: there are ten or twelve in the Cambridge Libraries; and
they are not less numerous at Oxford. As might be expected in a popular
work like this, the manuscripts are in general full of variations; but
there are two classes of manuscripts which give two texts that are widely
different from each other, those variations commencing even with the first
lines of the poem. One of these texts, which was adopted in the early
printed editions, is given in the present volumes; the other text was
selected for publication by Dr. Whitaker. The following extract, comprising
the first lines of the poem,[19] will show how each text begins, and will
enable those who possess manuscripts of Piers Ploughman to ascertain at
once to which text they belong:--

      TEXT I.                            TEXT II.

  In a somer seson                   In a some seyson,
  Whan softe was the sonne,          Whan softe was the sonne,
  I shop me into shroudes            Y shop into shrobbis
  As I a sheep weere,                As y shepherde were.
  In habite as an heremite           In abit az an ermite
  Unholy of werkes,                  Unholy of werkes,
  Wente wide in this world           That wente forthe in the worle
  Wonders to here,                   Wondres to hure,
  Ac on a May morwenynge             And sawe meny cellis
  On Malverne hilles                 And selcouthe thynges.
  Me bifel a ferly,                  Ac on a May morwenyng
  Of fairye me thoghte.              On Malverne hulles
  I was wery for-wandred,            Me by-fel for to slepe,
  And wente me to reste              For weyrynesse of wandryng,
  Under a broode bank                And in a lande as ich lay
  By a bournes syde,                 Lenede ich and slepte,
  And as I lay and lenede,           And merveylously me mette,
  And loked on the watres,           As ich may yow telle.
  I slombred into a slepyng,         Al the welthe of this worlde,
  It sweyed so murye.                And the woo bothe,
  Thanne gan I meten                 Wynkyng as it were
  A merveillous swevene,             Wyterly ich saw hyt,
  That I was in a wildernesse        Of truyth and of tricherye,
  Wiste I nevere where;              Of tresoun and of gyle,
  And as I biheld in to the eest     Al ich saw slepyng,
  An heigh to the sonne,             As ich shal yow telle.
  I seigh a tour on a toft, etc.     Esteward ich behulde
                                     After the sonne,
                                     And sawe a tour as ich trowede, etc.

Besides such variations as appear in the foregoing specimen, there are in
the second text many considerable additions, omissions, and transpositions.
It would not be easy to account for the existence of two texts differing so
much; but it is my impression that the first was the one published by the
author, and that the variations were made by some other person, who was
perhaps induced by his own political sentiments to modify passages, and was
gradually led on to publish a revision of the whole. It is certain that in
some parts of Text II. the strong sentiments or expressions of the first
text are softened down. We may give as an example of this, the statement of
the popular opinion of the origin and purpose of kingly government:--

      TEXT I.                            TEXT II.

  Thanne kam ther a kyng,            Thanne cam ther a kyng,
  Knyghthod hym ladde,               Knyghtod hym ladde,
  Might of the communes              The meche myghte of the men
  Made hym to regne.                 Made hym to regne.
  And thanne cam kynde wit,          And thanne cam a kynde witte,
  And clerkes he made,               And clerkus he made,
  For to counseillen the kyng,       And concience and kynde wit,
  And the commune save.              And knyghthod to-gederes,
  The kyng and knyghthod,            Caste that the comune
  And clergie bothe,                 Sholde hure comunes fynde.
  Casten that the commune            Kynde wit and the comune
  Sholde hem self fynde.             Contrevede alle craftes,
  The commune contreved              And for most profitable to the puple,
  Of kynde wit craftes,              A plouh thei gonne make,
  And for profit of al the peple     Wit leil labour to lyve,
  Plowmen ordeyned,                  Wyl lyve and londe lasteth.
  To tilie and to travaille,
  As trewe lif asketh.
  The kyng and the commune,
  And kynde wit the thridde,
  Shopen lawe and leaute,
  Ech man to knowe his owene.

Nobody, I think, can deny that in this instance the doctrine is stated far
more distinctly and far more boldly in the first text than in the second.
In general the first text is the best, whether we look at the mode in which
the sentiments are stated, or at the poetry and language.

As far as I have been able to examine the remaining manuscripts of Piers
Ploughman, at London and in the Universities, I think that nearly
two-thirds of those which remain are of the _fourteenth_ century; and the
greater number, particularly of those written in the fourteenth century,
present what I have distinguished as the first text, that given in the
present volumes. I am by no means inclined to coincide in the reasons which
led Dr. Whitaker to prefer the second text; if I were disposed to admit, as
barely possible (the supposition is quite a gratuitous one), "that the
first edition of this work appeared when its author was a young man, and
that he lived and continued in the habit of transcribing to extreme old
age" (Pref.), I cannot agree with an editor in adopting a copy which he
believes to be "a faithful representation of the work as it came first from
the author," and which not only abounds in words and idioms which he
afterwards altered, but which contains also "many original passages which
the greater maturity of the author's judgment induced him to expunge."

I know only of two manuscripts of the Creed of Piers Ploughman, one in the
British Museum (MS. Reg. 18, B. XVII.), the other in the Library of Trinity
College, Cambridge, both on paper, and written long after the date of the
printed editions, from which they appear to have been copied.

The first printed edition of the Vision was that of Robert Crowley, in
1550; and it was so favourably received, that there is reason for believing
that no less than three editions (or rather three impressions[20]) were
sold in the course of the year. It is clear that Crowley had obtained an
excellent manuscript; the printer has changed the orthography at will, and
has evidently altered a word at times, but on the whole this printed text
differs very little from the one we now publish.

Three years after the appearance of the Vision, another printer, Reynold
Wolfe, published the first edition of the Creed, in the same form as
Crowley's edition of the Vision.[21]

After the stormy reign of Mary was past, in the beginning of that of
Elizabeth, the call for a new edition, and perhaps the destruction of many
copies of the old one, led the well-known printer Owen Rogers to reprint
the Vision and the Creed together.[22] The impression was probably large,
for it is still by no means a rare book. It was evidently much read during
the reign of Elizabeth, and is not unfrequently alluded to by the writers
of that age.

No other edition of this popular poem appeared, until it was published by
Dr. Whitaker, in 1813,[23] from a manuscript then in the possession of Mr.
Heber,[24] which contained the second text, written in a rather broad
provincial dialect. This edition was printed in black-letter, in a very
large and expensive form. In 1814, a reprint of the old edition of the
Creed was published in the same form, as a companion to the Vision. It is
not generally known that Dr. Whitaker projected an edition of the same text
and paraphrase which are given in his 4to edition, in 8vo, with Roman type
instead of black-letter. After a few sheets had been composed, the design
was abandoned, as it is said, in favour of the larger form. A copy of the
proof sheets, formerly belonging to Mr. Haslewood, is now in the possession
of Sir Frederick Madden. I am told that a rival edition was also begun, but
not persevered in.

An attempt at a modernization, or rather a translation, of Piers Ploughman,
was made in the earlier years of the present century, but only a few
specimens appear to have been executed. The following lines, which possess
some merit (though not very literal or correct), are the modern version the
author proposed to give of ll. 2847-2870 of the poem. They were
communicated to me by Sir Henry Ellis.

 "Next AVARICE came: but how he look'd, to say,
  Words do I want that rightly shall portray:
  Like leathern purse his shrivell'd cheeks did shew,
  Thick lipp'd, with two blear eyes and beetle brow:
  In a torn threadbare tabard was he clad,
  Which twelve whole winters now in wear he had;
  French scarlet 'twas, its colour well it kept,
  So smooth that louse upon its surface crept."

It will be necessary, in conclusion, to say a few words on the edition now
offered to the public. Without taking into consideration the inaccuracies
and imperfections of Whitaker's edition, its inconvenient size and high
price made it altogether inaccessible to the general reader; and there
appeared to be a wish for one in a more convenient and less expensive form.
At the same time it was desired that a good text of a work so important for
the history of our language and literature should be selected. Dr. Whitaker
was not well qualified for this undertaking; he also laboured under many
disadvantages; he had access to only three manuscripts, and those not very
good ones; and he has not chosen the best text even of those. Unless he had
some reason to believe that the book was originally written in a particular
dialect, he ought to have given a preference to that among the oldest
manuscripts which presents the purest language; but we cannot allow that
manuscript to be chosen on a ground so capricious as "that the orthography
and dialect in which it is written approach very near to that semi-Saxon
jargon in the midst of which the editor was brought up, and which he
continues to hear daily spoken on the confines of Lancashire, and the West
Riding of the county of York." (Pref.) This could not have been the
language employed by a monk of Malvern.

The present editor has endeavoured, in the leisure moments which he has
been able to snatch from other employments, to supply the deficiency as
well, and in as unassuming manner, as he could. He has chosen for his text
a manuscript belonging to the valuable library of Trinity College,
Cambridge (where its shelf-mark is B. 15, 17), because it appears to him to
be the best and oldest manuscript now in existence. It is a fine folio
manuscript, on vellum, written in a large hand, undoubtedly contemporary
with the author of the poem, and in remarkably pure English, with
ornamented initial letters. His object has been to give the poem as popular
a form as is consistent with philological correctness. He has added a few
notes which occurred to him in the course of editing the text, and which he
hopes may render the meaning and allusions sometimes clearer to the general
reader, for whom more especially they are intended. They might have been
enlarged and rendered more complete, if he had been master of sufficient
leisure to enable him to undertake extensive researches. But there are
allusions, as well as words, in both poems to which it would be difficult
at present to give any certain explanation. It has been thought advisable
to give in the notes the important variations of the second text, from Dr.
Whitaker's edition; and a few readings are added from a second manuscript
in Trinity College Library (R. 3, 14). The editor has hoped to add to the
utility of the book by a copious glossary. He has been unwillingly obliged
to leave a few words without explanation; all our early alliterative poetry
abounds in difficult words. In this point he has to acknowledge the kind
assistance of Sir Frederick Madden, whom no person equals in profound
knowledge of English glossography, and than whom no one is more generous to
advise and assist those who are in need of his aid. To Sir Henry Ellis, who
kindly lent him his own manuscript notes on Piers Ploughman, the editor
also owes his grateful acknowledgments; and he regrets that at the time he
received them the notes were already so far printed as to hinder him from
making as much use of them as he could have wished.

    I perceyved of the power
  That Peter hadde to kepe,                                200

  How he it lefte with love,
  As oure Lord highte,
  Amonges foure vertues,
  The beste of alle vertues,
  That cardinals ben called,
  And closynge yates.
  There is Crist in his kingdom
  To close and to shette,                                  210
  And to opene it to hem,
  And hevene blisse shewe.

    Ac of the cardinals at court
  That kaughte of that name,
  And power presumed in hem
  A pope to make,
  To han that power that Peter hadde,
  Impugnen I nelle;
  For in love and in lettrure
  The election bilongeth,                                  220
  For-thi I kan and kan naught
  Of court speke moore.

    Thanne kam ther a kyng,
  Knyghthod hym ladde,

  Might of the communes
  Made hym to regne.

    And thanne cam kynde wit,
  And clerkes he made,
  For to counseillen the kyng,

    The commune contreved
  Of kynde wit craftes,
  And for profit of al the peple
  Plowmen ordeyned,
  To tilie and to travaille,
  As trewe lif asketh.                                     240

  And kynde wit the thridde,
  Shopen lawe and leaute,
  Ech man to knowe his owene.

    Thanne loked up a lunatik,
  A leene thyng with-alle,
  And, knelynge to the kyng,
  Clergially he seide:

    "Crist kepe thee, sire kyng!
  And thi kyng-ryche,                                      250
  And lene thee lede thi lond,
  So leaute thee lovye,
  And for thi rightful rulyng
  Be rewarded in hevene."

    And sithen in the eyr an heigh
  An aungel of hevene
  Lowed to speke in Latyn,
  For lewed men ne koude
  {9}
  Jangle ne jugge,
  That justifie hem sholde,                                260
  But suffren and serven;
  For-thi seide the aungel:
  _Sum rex, sum princeps,
  Neutrum fortasse deinceps;
  O qui jura regis
  Christi specialia regis,
  Hoc quod agas melius,
  Justus es, esto pius.
  Nudum jus a te

  Qualia vis metere,
  Talia grana sere.
  Si jus nudatur,
  Nudo de jure metatur;
  Si seritur pietas,

    Thanne greved hym a goliardeis,
  A gloton of wordes,
  And to the aungel an heigh
  Answerde after:                                          280
  _Dum rex a regere
  Dicatur nomen habere;
  Nomen habet sine re,
  Nisi studet jura tenere._

    Thanne gan al the commune
  Crye in vers of Latyn,
  To the kynges counseil;
  Construe who so wolde:
  _Praecepta regis
  Sunt nobis vincula legis._                               290

    With that ran ther a route
  Of ratons at ones,
  {10}
  And smale mees myd hem
  Mo than a thousand,
  And comen to a counseil
  For the commune profit;
  For a cat of a contree
  Cam whan hym liked,
  And overleep hem lightliche,
  And laughte hem at his wille,                            300
  And pleide with hem perillousli,
  And possed aboute.
  "For doute of diverse dredes,
  We dar noght wel loke;
  And if we grucche of his gamen,
  He wol greven us alle,
  Cracchen us or clawen us,
  And in hise clouches holde,

    A raton of renoun,
  Moost renable of tonge,
  Seide for a sovereyn
  Help to hymselve:

    "I have y-seyen segges," quod he
  "In the cite of Londone,                                 320
  Beren beighes ful brighte
  Abouten hire nekkes,
  And somme colers of crafty werk;
  Uncoupled thei wenten
  Bothe in wareyne and in waast
  Where hemself liked.
  {11}
  And outher while thei arn ellis-where,
  As I here telle;
  Were ther a belle on hire beighe,
  By Jhesu, as me thynketh,                                330
  Men myghte witen wher thei wente,
  And awey renne!"

    "And right so," quod that raton,
  "Reson me sheweth,
  To bugge a belle of bras,
  Or of bright silver,
  And knytten it on a coler
  For oure commune profit,
  Wher he ryt or rest,
  Or renneth to pleye;                                     340
  And if hym list for to laike,
  Thanne loke we mowen,
  And peeren in his presence
  The while him pleye liketh:
  And, if hym wratheth, be war,
  And his way shonye."

    Al this route of ratons
  To this reson thei assented.
  Ac tho the belle was y-brought,
  And on the beighe hanged,                                350
  Ther ne was raton in al the route,
  For al the reaume of Fraunce,

  About the cattes nekke,
  Ne hangen it aboute the cattes hals,
  Al Engelond to wynne.
  Alle helden hem un-hardy,
  And hir counseil feble;
  And leten hire labour lost
  And al hire longe studie.                                360
  {12}

    A mous that muche good
  Kouthe, as me thoughte,
  Strook forth sternely,
  And stood bifore hem alle,
  And to the route of ratons
  Reherced thise wordes:

    "Though we killen the cat,
  Yet sholde ther come another
  To cacchen us and al oure kynde,
  Though we cropen under benches.                          370
  For-thi I counseille al the commune
  To late the cat worthe;
  And be we nevere bolde
  The belle hym to shewe;
  For I herde my sire seyn,
  Is seven yeer y-passed,
  Ther the cat is a kitone
  The court is ful elenge;
  That witnesseth holy writ,
  Who so wole it rede:                                     380
  _Vae terrae ubi puer rex est! etc._
  For may no renk ther reste have
  For ratons by nyghte;
  The while he caccheth conynges,
  He coveiteth noght youre caroyne,
  But fedeth hym al with venyson:
  Defame we hym nevere.
  For better is a litel los
  Than a long sorwe,
  The maze among us alle,                                  390
  Theigh we mysse a sherewe;

  And also ye route of ratons

  That can yow over-lepe;
  For hadde ye rattes youre wille,

    "I seye for me," quod the mous,                        400
  "I se so muchel after,
  Shal nevere the cat ne the kiton
  By my counseil be greved,
  Thorugh carpynge of this coler
  That costed me nevere
  And though it hadde costned me catel,
  Bi-knowen it I nolde,
  But suffren, as hymself wolde,

  "Now sorwe mote thow have,
  Swiche weddynges to werche,
  To wrathe with truthe;
  And er this weddynge be wroght,
  Wo thee bitide!

    "For Mede is muliere                                  1120
  Of Amendes engendred,
  And God graunteth to gyve
  Mede to Truthe;
  And thow hast gyven hire to a gilour;
  Now God gyve thee sorwe!
  Thi text telleth thee noght so,
  Truthe woot the sothe;
  For _Dignus est operarius_
  His hire to have,
  And thow hast fest hire to Fals,                        1130
  Fy on thi lawe!
  For al bi lesynges thow lyvest
  And lecherouse werkes.
  Symonye and thiself
  Shenden holi chirche;
  The notaries and ye
  Noyen the peple;
  Ye shul a-biggen it bothe,
  By God that me made!

    "Wel ye witen, wernardes,                             1140
  But if youre wit faille,
  {36}
  That Fals is feithlees
  And fikel in hise werkes,
  And was a bastarde y-bore
  Of Belsabubbes kynne;
  And Mede is muliere,
  A maiden of goode,
  And myghte kisse the kyng
  For cosyn, and she wolde.

    "For-thi wercheth by wisdom,                          1150
  And by wit also;
  And ledeth hire to Londone,
  There it is y-shewed,
  If any lawe wol loke
  Thei ligge togideres;
  And though justices juggen hire
  To be joyned to Fals,
  Yet be war of weddynge;
  For witty is Truthe,
  And Conscience is of his counseil,                      1160
  And knoweth yow echone,
  And if he fynde yow in defaute
  And with the false holde,
  It shal bi-sitte youre soules
  Ful soure at the laste."

    Herto assenteth Cyvyle,
  Ac Symonye ne wolde,
  Til he hadde silver for his service,
  And also the notaries.

    Thanne fette Favel forth                              1170
  Floryns ynowe,
  And bad Gile to gyven
  Gold al aboute,
  And namely to the notaries
  That hem noon ne faille,
  {37}
  And feffe false witnesses
  With floryns ynowe,
  "For thei may Mede a-maistrye,
  And maken at my wille."

    Tho this gold was y-gyve,                             1180
  Gret was the thonkyng
  To Fals and to Favel
  For hire faire giftes,
  And comen to conforten
  From care the false,
  And seiden, "Certes, sire,
  Cessen shul we nevere,
  Til Mede be thi wedded wif
  Thorugh wittes of us alle;
  For we have Mede a-maistried                            1190
  With oure murie speche,
  That she graunteth to goon,
  With a good wille,
  To London, to loken
  If the lawe wolde
  Juggen yow joyntly
  In joie for evere."

    Thanne was Falsnesse fayn,
  And Favel as blithe,
  And leten somone alle segges                            1200
  In shires aboute,
  And bad hem alle be bown,
  Beggers and othere,
  To wenden with hem to Westmynstre
  To witnesse this dede.

    Ac thanne cared thei for caples
  To carien hem thider,
  And Favel fette forth thanne
  Foles ynowe,
  {38}
  And sette Mede upon a sherreve                          1210
  Shoed al newe.

    And Fals sat on a sisour,
  That softeli trotted;
  And Favel on a flaterere
  Fetisly atired.

    Tho hadde notaries none,
  Anoyed thei were,
  For Symonye and Cyvylle
  Sholde on hire feet gange.

    Ac thanne swoor Symonye,                              1220
  And Cyvylle bothe,
  That somonours sholde be sadeled
  And serven hem echone,
  And late apparaille thise provisours
  In palfreyes wise,
  Sire Symonye hymself
  Shal sitte upon hir bakkes.

    "Denes and southdenes,
  Drawe yow togideres,
  Erchdekenes and officials,                              1230
  And alle youre registrers,
  Lat sadle hem with silver
  Oure synne to suffre,
  As avoutrye and divorses,
  And derne usurie,
  To bere bisshopes aboute
  A-brood in visitynge.

    "Paulynes pryvees
  For pleintes in consistorie,
  Shul serven myself                                      1240
  That Cyvyle is nempned.

    "And cart-sadle the commissarie,
  Oure cart shal he lede,
  {39}
  And fecchen us vitailles.
  At _Fornicatores_.
  And maketh of Lyere a lang cart
  To leden alle thise othere,
  As freres and faitours,
  That on hire feet rennen."

    And thus Fals and Favel                               1250
  Fareth forth togideres,
  And Mede in the middes,
  And alle thise men after.

    I have no tome to telle
  The tail that hire folwed;
  Ac Gyle was for-goer,
  And gyed hem alle.

    Sothnesse seigh hem wel,
  And seide but litel,
  And priked his palfrey,                                 1260
  And passed hem alle,
  And com to the kynges court,
  And Conscience it tolde;
  And Conscience to the kyng
  Carped it after.

    "Now, by Crist," quod the kyng,
  "And I cacche myghte
  Fals or Favel,
  Or any of hise feeris,
  I wolde be wroken of tho wrecches                       1270
  That wercheth so ille,
  And doon hem hange by the hals,
  And alle that hem maynteneth;
  Shal nevere man of this molde
  Meynprise the leeste,
  But right as the lawe wol loke,
  Lat falle on hem alle."
  {40}

    And comaunded a constable
  That com at the firste,
  To attachen tho tyrauntz,                               1280
  "For any thyng I hote,
  And fettreth faste Falsnesse,
  For any kynnes giftes,
  And girdeth of Gyles heed,
  And lat hym go no ferther;
  And if ye lacche Lyere,
  Lat hym noght ascapen
  Er he be put on the pillory,
  For any preyere, I hote;
  And bryngeth Mede to me                                 1290
  Maugree hem alle."

    Drede at the dore stood,
  And the doom herde,
  And how the kyng comaunded
  Constables and sergeauntz
  Falsnesse and his felawshipe
  To fettren and to bynden.

    Thanne Drede wente wyghtliche,
  And warned the False,
  And bad hym fle for fere,                               1300
  And hise felawes alle.

    Falsnesse for fere thanne
  Fleigh to the ffreres,
  And Gyle dooth hym to go,
  A-gast for to dye;
  Ac marchauntz metten with hym
  And made hym abide,
  And bi-shetten hym in hire shoppes
  To shewen hire ware,
  Apparailed hym as apprentice                            1310
  The peple to serve.
  {41}

    Lightliche Lyere
  Leep awey thanne,
  Lurkynge thorugh lanes,
  To-lugged of manye.
  He was nowher welcome,
  For his manye tales,
  Over al y-honted,
  And y-hote trusse,
  Til pardoners hadde pite,                               1320
  And pulled hym into house.
  They wesshen hym and wiped hym.
  And wounden hym in cloutes,
  And senten hym with seles
  On Sondayes to chirches,
  And yeven pardoun for pens
  Pounde-mele aboute.

  To spien hire ware;
  For he kouthe of hir craft,
  And knewe manye gommes.

  Mette with hym ones,
  And helden hym an half-yeer
  And ellevene dayes.

    Freres with fair speche                               1340
  Fetten hym pennes,
  And for knowynge of comeres
  Coped hym as a frere;
  Ac he hath leve to lepen out,
  As ofte as hym liketh,
  {42}
  And is welcome whan he wile,
  And woneth with hem ofte.

    Alle fledden for fere,
  And flowen into hernes;
  Save Mede the mayde,                                    1350
  Na-mo dorste abide.
  Ac trewely to telle,
  She trembled for drede,
  And ek wepte and wrong,
  Whan she was attached.                                  1355

          _Passus Tertius de Visione, ut supra._

  Now is Mede the mayde,                                  1356
  And na-mo of hem alle,
  With bedeles and with baillies
  Brought bifore the kyng.

    The kyng called a clerk,                              1360
  Kan I noght his name,
  To take Mede the maide
  And maken hire at ese.
  "I shal assayen hire myself,
  And soothliche appose,
  What man of this moolde
  That hire were levest.
  And if she werche bi wit,
  And my wil folwe,
  I wol forgyven hire this gilt,                          1370
  So me God helpe!"

    Curteisly the clerk thanne,
  As the kyng highte,
  Took Mede bi the myddel
  And broghte hire into chambre;
  And ther was murthe and mynstralcie,
  Mede to plese.

    They that wonyeth in Westmynstre                         =
  Worshipeth hire alle,                                   1380
  {44}
  Gentilliche with joye;
  The justices somme
  Busked hem to the bour
  Ther the burde dwellede,
  To conforten hire kyndely,
  By clergies leve;
  And seiden, "Mourne noght, Mede,
  Ne make thow no sorwe;
  For we wol wisse the kyng,
  And thi wey shape,                                      1390
  To be wedded at thi wille,
  And wher thee leef liketh,
  For al Consciences cast
  Or craft, as I trowe."

    Mildely Mede thanne
  Merciede hem alle
  Of hire grete goodnesse,
  And gaf hem echone
  Coupes of clene gold,
  And coppes of silver,                                   1400
  Rynges with rubies,
  And richesses manye;
  The leeste man of hire meynee
  A moton of golde.
  Than laughte thei leve
  Thise lordes at Mede.

    With that comen clerkes
  To conforten hire the same,
  And beden hire be blithe;
  "For we beth thyne owene,                               1410
  For to werche thi wille,
  The while thow myght laste."

    Hendiliche heo thanne
  Bi-highte hem the same,
  {45}
  To loven hem lelly,
  And lordes to make,
  And in the consistorie at the court
  Do callen hire names;
  "Shal no lewednesse lette
  The leode that I lovye,                                 1420
  That he ne worth first avaunced;
  For I am bi-knowen,
  There konnynge clerkes
  Shul clokke bi-hynde."

    Thanne cam ther a confessour,
  Coped as a frere;
  To Mede the mayde
  He meved thise wordes,
  And seide ful softely,
  In shrift as it were,                                   1430
  "Theigh lewed men and lered men
  Hadde leyen by thee bothe,
  And Falsnesse hadde y-folwed thee
  Alle thise fifty wynter,
  I shal assoille thee myself
  For a seem of whete,
  And also be thi bedeman,
  And bere wel thi message
  Amonges knyghtes and clerkes,
  Conscience to torne."                                   1440

    Thanne Mede for hire mysdedes
  To that man kneled,
  And shrof hire of hire sherewednesse,
  Shamelees, I trowe;
  Tolde hym a tale,
  And took hym a noble,
  For to ben hire bedeman
  And hire brocour als.
  {46}

    Thanne he assoiled hire soone,
  And sithen he seide,                                    1450
  "We have a wyndow in werchynge
  Wole sitten us ful hye,
  Woldestow glaze that gable
  And grave therinne thy name,
  Syker sholde thi soule be
  Hevene to have."

    "Wiste I that," quod that womman,
  "I wolde noght spare
  For to be youre frend, frere,
  And faile yow nevere,                                   1460
  While ye love lordes
  That lecherie haunten,
  And lakketh noght ladies
  That loven wel the same.
  It is freletee of flesshe,
  Ye fynden it in bokes,
  And a cours of kynde
  Wherof we comen alle.
  Who may scape sclaundre,
  The scathe is soone amended;                            1470
  It is synne of the sevene

    "Have mercy," quod Mede,
  "Of men that it haunteth,
  And I shal covere youre kirk,
  Youre cloistre do maken,
  Wowes do whiten,
  And wyndowes glazen,
  Do peynten and portraye,

  That every segge shal seye
  I am suster of youre house."
  {47}

    Ac God to alle good folk
  Swich gravynge defendeth,
  To writen in wyndowes
  Of hir wel dedes,

  And pomp of the world;
  For Crist knoweth thi conscience,
  And thi kynde wille,                                    1490
  And thi cost and thi coveitise,
  And who the catel oughte.

    For-thi I lere yow, lordes,
  Leveth swiche werkes;
  To writen in wyndowes
  Of youre wel dedes,
  Or to greden after Goddes men
  Whan ye dele doles,
  On aventure ye have youre hire here,
  And youre hevene als.                                   1500
  _Nesciat sinistra quid faciat dextra._

    Lat noght thi left half

  To kepe the lawes,
  To punysshe on pillories
  And pynynge-stooles,
  Brewesters and baksters,
  Bochiers and cokes,
  For thise are men on this molde
  {48}
  That moost harm wercheth
  To the povere peple

    Ac Mede the mayde                                     1530
  The mair hath bi-sought
  Of alle swiche selleris

  The regratiers to mayntene;
  "For my love," quod that lady,

  Som del ayeins reson."

    Salomon the sage
  A sermon he made,
  For to amenden maires
  And men that kepen lawes;
  And tolde hem this teme,

  Al to bloo askes
  The houses and homes
  Of hem that desireth

  By cause of hire offices.

    The kyng fro the conseil cam,
  And called after Mede,                                  1560
  And of sente hire as swithe
  With sergeauntz manye,
  And broughte hire to boure
  With blisse and with joye.

    Curteisly the kyng thanne
  Comsed to telle,
  To Mede the mayde
  He meveth thise wordes,
  "Unwittily, womman,
  Wroght hastow ofte,                                     1570
  Ac worse wroghtestow nevere

  But I forgyve thee that gilt,
  And graunte thee my grace;
  Hennes to thi deeth day
  Do so na-moore.

    "I have a knyght Conscience,
  Cam late fro biyonde;
  If he wilneth thee to wif,
  Wiltow hym have?"                                       1580

    "Ye, lord," quod that lady,
  "Lord forbede it ellis!
  But I be holly at youre heste,
  Lat hange me soone."
  {50}

    And thanne was Conscience called
  To come and appere
  Bifore the kyng and his conseil,
  As clerkes and othere.

    Knelynge Conscience
  To the kyng louted,                                     1590
  To wite what his wille were,
  And what he do wolde.

    "Woltow wedde this womman," quod the kyng,
  "If I wole assente?
  For she is fayn of thi felaweshipe,
  For to be thi make."

    Quod Conscience to the kyng,
  "Crist it me forbede!

  Wo me bitide!                                           1600
  For she is frele of hire feith,
  Fikel of hire speche,
  And maketh men mysdo
  Many score tymes;
  Trust of hire tresor
  Bitrayeth ful manye.

    "Wyves and widewes

  For she is tikel of hire tail,
  And tale-wis of hire tonge;                             1620
  As commune as a cartwey

  Com ayeins Reson,                                       2170
  {68}
  And bitwene hymself and his sone
  Sette hym on benche;
  And wordeden wel wisely
  A gret while togideres.

    And thanne com Pees into parlement,
  And putte forth a bille,
  How Wrong ayeins his wille
  Hadde his wif taken,
  And how he ravysshede Rose
  Reginaldes loove,                                       2180
  And Margrete of hir maydenhede
  Maugree hire chekes.
  "Bothe my gees and my grys
  Hise gadelynges feccheth,
  I dar noght for fere of hem
  Fighte ne chide.
  He borwed of me Bayard,
  He broughte hym hom nevere,
  Ne no ferthyng therfore,
  For ought I koude plede.                                2190
  He maynteneth hise men
  To murthere myne hewen,
  Forstalleth my feires,
  And fighteth in my chepyng,
  And breketh up my bernes dore,
  And bereth awey my whete,
  And taketh me but a taille
  For ten quarters of otes;
  And yet he beteth me therto,
  And lyth by my mayde.                                   2200
  I am noght hardy for hym
  Unnethe to loke."

    The kyng knew he seide sooth,
  For Conscience hym tolde
  {69}
  That Wrong was a wikked luft,
  And wroghte muche sorwe.

    Wrong was afered thanne,
  And Wisdom he soughte,
  To maken pees with hise pens;
  And profred hym manye,                                  2210
  And seide, "Hadde I love of my lord the kyng,
  Litel wolde I recche,
  Theigh Pees and his power
  Pleyned hym evere."

    Tho wente Wisdom
  And sire Waryn the Witty,
  For that Wrong hadde y-wroght
  So wikked a dede,
  And warnede Wrong tho
  With swich a wis tale,                                  2220
  "Who so wercheth by wille,
  Wrathe maketh ofte;
  I sey it by myself,
  Thow shalt it wel fynde;
  But if Mede it make,
  Thi meschief is uppe,
  For bothe thi lif and thi lond
  Lyth in his grace."

    Thanne wowede Wrong
  Wisdom ful yerne,                                       2230
  To maken pees with his pens,
  Handy dandy payed.

    Wisdom and Wit thanne
  Wenten togidres,
  And token Mede myd hem
  Mercy to wynne.

    Pees putte forth his heed,
  And his panne blody,
  {70}
  "Withouten gilt, God it woot,
  Gat I this scathe;                                      2240
  Conscience and the commune
  Knowen the sothe."

    Ac Wisdom and Wit
  Were aboute faste,
  To overcomen the kyng
  With catel, if thei myghte.

    The kyng swor by Crist,
  And by his crowne bothe,
  That Wrong for hise werkes
  Sholde wo tholie;                                       2250
  And comaundede a constable
  To casten hym in irens,
  And lete hym noght thise seven yer
  Seen his feet ones.

    "God woot," quod Wisdom,
  "That were noght the beste;
  And he amendes nowe make,
  Lat maynprise hym have,
  And be borgh for his bale,
  And buggen hym boote,                                   2260
  And so amenden that is mys-do
  And evere moore the bettre."

    Wit acorded therwith,
  And seide the same,
  "Bettre is that boote
  Bale a-doun brynge,
  Than bale be y-bet,
  And boote never the bettre."

    And thanne gan Mede to mengen hire,
  And mercy she bi-soughte,                               2270
  And profrede Pees a present
  Al of pure golde:
  {71}
  "Have this, man, of me," quod she,
  "To amenden thi scathe,
  For I wol wage for Wrong
  He wol do so na-moore."

    Pitously Pees thanne
  Preyde to the kynge,
  To have mercy on that man
  That mys-dide hym so ofte;                              2280
  "For he hath waged me wel,
  As Wisdom hym taughte,
  And I forgyve hym that gilt
  With a good wille,
  So that the kyng assente,
  I kan seye no bettre;
  For Mede hath me amendes maad,
  I may na-moore axe."

    "Nay," quod the kyng tho,
  "So me Crist helpe!                                     2290
  Wrong wendeth noght so a-wey,
  Erst wole I wite moore.
  For lope he so lightly,
  Laughen he wolde;
  And eft the boldere be
  To bete myne hewen;
  But Reson have ruthe on hym,
  He shal reste in my stokkes;
  And that as longe as he lyveth,
  But lownesse hym borwe."                                2300

    Som men radde Reson tho
  To have ruthe on that shrewe,
  And for to counseille the kyng,
  And Conscience after;
  That Mede moste be maynpernour
  Reson thei bi-soughte.
  {72}

    "Reed me noght," quod Reson,
  "No ruthe to have,

  Waryn Wisdom
  Wynked upon Mede,                                       2390

  For the mooste commune of that court
  Called hire an hore.

    He preved that thise pestilences
  Were for pure synne,

  On Saterday at even                                     2500
  Was pertliche for pure pride,

  How pertly afore the peple

  {79}
  He warnede Watte
  His wif was to blame,
  For hire heed was worth half marc,
  And his hood noght worth a grote;
  And bad Bette kutte
  A bough outher tweye,
  And bete Beton therwith,
  But if she wolde werche.

    And thanne he chargede chapmen
  To chastizen hir children,                              2540
  Late no wynnyng hem for-wanye
  While thei be yonge,

  Plese hem noght out of reson.
  "My sire seide so to me,

  "Lest the kyng and his conseil
  Youre comunes apeire,

  "It is thi trewe tresor,
  And tryacle at thy nede."

    And sithen he preide the pope
  Have pite on holy chirche,
  And er he gyve any grace,
  Governe first hymselve.

    "And ye that han lawes to kepe,
  Lat truthe be youre coveitise,
  Moore than gold outher giftes,                          2580
  If ye wol God plese;

    Thanne Lechour seide, "Allas!"
  And on oure Lady he cryde,
  To maken mercy for hise mys-dedes
  Bitwene God and his soule;                              2620
  With that he sholde the Saterday,
  Seven yer therafter,
  Drynke but myd the doke,
  And dyne but ones.

    Envye with hevy herte
  Asked after shrifte,
  And carefully _mea culpa_

  He was as pale as a pelet,
  In the palsy he semed;                                  2630
  And clothed in a kaurymaury,

  Of a freres frokke

  To wreke hymself he thoughte
  With werkes or with wordes,
  Whan he seyghe his tyme.
  Ech a word that he warpe
  Was of a neddres tonge;
  Of chidynge and of chalangynge
  Was his chief liflode,                                  2650

  As prest as a sperhauk;
  And therof was Piers proud,
  And putte hem to werke,
  And yaf hem mete as he myghte aforthe,

  Haveth the same absolucion
  That sent was to Piers.

    Beggeres ne bidderes
  Ne beth noght in the bulle,
  But if the suggestion be sooth
  That shapeth hem to begge.
  For he that beggeth or bit,
  But if he have nede,
  He is fals with the feend,
  And defraudeth the nedy;                                4610
  And also he bi-gileth the gyvere,
  Ageynes his wille;
  For if he wiste he were noght nedy,
  He wolde gyve that another
  That were moore nedy than he,
  So the nedieste sholde be holpe.
  Caton kenneth me thus,
  And the clerc of stories;
  _Cui des videto_,
  Is Catons techyng.                                      4620

  To bistowe thyn almesse.
  _Sit elemosina tua in manu tua,

  {143}

    Ac Gregory was a good man,
  And bad us gyven alle
  That asketh for his love
  That us al leneth.
  _Non eligas cui miserearis, ne forte
      praetereas illum qui meretur                        4630
      accipere. Quia incertum est
      pro quo Deo magis placeas._

    For wite ye nevere who is worthi,
  Ac God woot who hath nede;
  In hym that taketh is the trecherie,
  If any treson walke.
  For he that yeveth, yeldeth,
  And yarketh hym to reste;
  And he that biddeth, borweth,
  And bryngeth hymself in dette.                          4640
  For beggeres borwen evere mo,
  And hir borgh is God almyghty,
  To yelden hem that yeveth hem,
  And yet usure moore.
  _Quare non dedisti pecuniam meam
      ad mensam, ut ego veniam cum
      usuris exigere?_

    For-thi biddeth noght, ye beggeres,
  But if ye have gret nede;
  For who so hath to buggen hym breed,                    4650
  The book bereth witnesse,
  He hath y-nough that hath breed y-nough,
  Though he have noght ellis.
  _Satis dives est, qui non indiget pane._

    Lat usage be youre solas,
  Of seintes lyves redyng,
  The book banneth beggerie,
  {144}
  And blameth hem in this manere:
  _Junior fui, et jam senui, et non vidi
      justum derelictum, nec semen                        4660
      ejus, etc._

    For ye lyve in no love,
  Ne no lawe holde;
  Manye of yow ne wedde noght
  The womman that ye with deele,
  But as wilde bestes with 'wehee!'
  Worthen uppe and werchen,
  And bryngen forth barnes,
  That bastardes men calleth;
  Or the bak or som boon                                  4670
  He breketh in his youthe,
  And siththe goon faiten with youre fauntes
  For evere moore after.
  Ther is moore mys-shapen peple
  Amonges thise beggeres,
  Than of alle manere men
  That on this moolde walketh.
  And thei that lyve thus hir lif,
  Mowe lothe the tyme
  That evere thei were men wroght,                        4680

    And Piers at his preiere                              4700

  And I by-hynde hem bothe
  Biheld al the bulle,
  And in two lynes it lay,
  And noght a leef more,
  And was writen right thus,
  In witnesse of Truthe:
  _Et qui bona egerunt, ibunt in vitam eternam.              =

    Ac for the book Bible
  Bereth witnesse
  How Daniel divined
  The dreem of a kyng,                                    4800
  That was Nabugodonosor
  Nempned of clerkes.

    Daniel seide, "Sire kyng,
  Thi dremels bitokneth
  That unkouthe knyghtes shul come
  Thi kyngdom to cleyme;
  Amonges lower lordes
  Thi lond shal be departed."
  And as Daniel divined,
  In dede it fel after;                                   4810
  The kyng lees his lordshipe,
  And lower men it hadde.

    And Joseph mette merveillously
  How the moone and the sonne
  And the ellevene sterres
  Hailsed hym alle.

    Thanne Jacob jugged

  I myself and my sones,
  Seche thee for nede."

    It bifel as his fader seide,
  In Pharaoes tyme,
  That Joseph was justice
  Egipte to loke;
  It bifel as his fader tolde,
  Hise frendes there hym soughte,
  And al this maketh me
  {149}
  On this metels to thynke.                               4830
  And how the preest preved
  No pardon to Do-wel,
  And demed that Do-wel
  Indulgences passed,
  Biennals and triennals,
  And bisshopes lettres;
  And how Do-wel at the day of dome
  Is digneliche underfongen,
  And passeth al the pardon
  Of seint Petres cherche.                                4840

    Now hath the pope power
  Pardon to graunte the peple,
  Withouten any penaunce
  To passen into hevene;
  This is oure bileve,
  As lettred men us techeth:
  _Quodcumque ligaveris super terram,
      erit ligatum et in coelis, etc._                       =

    And so I leve leelly,                                 4850

  And preieres doon save

  Seven sithes dedly;
  Ac to truste to thise triennals,
  Trewely me thynketh,
  Is noght so siker for the soule,
  Certes, as is Do-wel.

  And for wise men ben holden,

  Theigh ye be founde in the fraternite
  Of alle the foure ordres,
  And have indulgences double-fold,
  But if Do-wel yow helpe,
  I sette youre patentes and youre pardon
  At one pies hele.

    For-thi I counseille alle Cristene
  To crie God mercy,

  I shal brynge yow a Bible,

Notes

[1] See the "Apocalypsis Goliae" and other pieces in the poems of Walter
Mapes; the Order of Fair Ease in the Political Songs, and the Poems of
Rutebeuf; and, in English, the remarkable "Poem on the Evil Times of Edward
II." in the appendix to the Political Songs. The Poem entitled the Order of
Fair Ease bears some resemblance to the _Abbaye de Theleme_ of Rabelais.

[2] This sentiment was perpetuated in a numerous class of ballads, in which
the monarch is represented as thrown incognito among the lower classes, as
listening to their expressions of loyalty and to the tale of their
sufferings. See the "Tale of King Edward and the Shepherd" in Hartshorne's
_Ancient Metrical Tales_; "The King and the Barker," in Ritson's _Pieces of
Ancient Popular Poetry_; "The King and the Miller," and "King Edward IV.
and the Tanner of Tamworth," in _Percy's Reliques_; &c. The earliest known
form of this tale is the story of "Henry II. and the Cistercian Abbot,"
printed from Giraldus Cambrensis in the _Reliquiae Antiquiae_, vol. ii. p.
147.

[3] It was at least a tradition early in the sixteenth century (for we have
no means now of ascertaining whether there were any substantial grounds for
the statement), that the author was named Robert Longlande (or Langlande),
that he was born at Cleobury Mortimer in Shropshire, and that (after
receiving his education at Oxford) he became a monk of Malvern. I do not
think, with Tyrwhitt and Price, that the name _Wil_, given in the poem to
the dreamer, necessarily shows that the writer's name was _William_; and
still less that the mention of "Kytte my wif" and "Calote my doghter" (p.
395 of the present volume), and of the dreamer's having resided at
Cornhill, refer to the family and residence of the author of the poem. If
he were a monk (as appears probable by his intimate acquaintance with the
Scriptures and the Fathers), he would not be married. Sir Frederick Madden
discovered a very important entry in a hand of the fifteenth century on the
fly-leaf of a manuscript of Piers Ploughman in the library of Trinity
College, Dublin, to the following effect--"Memorandum, quod Stacy de
Rokayle, pater Willielmi de Langlond, qui Stacius fuit generosus, et
morabatur in Schiptone under Whicwode, tenens domini Le Spenser in comitatu
Oxon., _qui praedictus Willielmus fecit librum qui vocatur Perys
Ploughman_."--It would perhaps be not impossible to trace the name and
history of this Stacy de Rokayle; but till that be done, I do not think
this memorandum ought to be considered as overthrowing the old tradition
relating to Robert Longlande. It may be mentioned as a remarkable specimen
of the patriotism of David Buchanan, that he lays claim to the author of
Piers Ploughman as a Scotchman:--"Robertus Langland, natione Scotus,
professione sacerdos, vir ex obscuris ortus parentibus, pius admodum et
ingeniosus et zelo divinae gloriae plenus; inter monachos Benedictinos
educatus in civitate Aberdonensi, vir aeque erat in omni humaniore
literatura insigniter doctus, et in medicina admodum clarus, pium opus
sermone vulgare scripsit cui imposuit, || Visionem Petri Aratoris, lib. 1.
|| Pro conjugio sacerdotum. lib. 1. || Claruit anno Christi Redemptoria,
1369. Regnante Davide Secundo in Scotia."--Dav. Buchanan, _de Scriptoribus
Scotis. MS. Bibl. Univ. Edin._

[4] We may mention another historical allusion in Piers Ploughman, which
seems to involve a chronological difficulty; the dry April in the mayoralty
of John Chichester, 1. 8567. It appears clear that this is an allusion to a
remarkable drought in the year 1351, which answers precisely to a
calculation of the date given in the text, in which all the manuscripts
that I have consulted agree. But the only year in which Chichester is said
to have been mayor was 1368-9 according to some, or 1369-70 according to
others. Stowe (as quoted in the note on this passage) has altered the text
of Piers Ploughman to suit the year in which Chichester is known to have
been mayor: yet there can be little doubt (even from the allusion to the
treaty of Bretigny) that the poem itself was composed before that date, and
therefore the same or another Chichester had probably been mayor before.

[5] Political Songs, p. 240.

[6] This terrible calamity was said by the astrologers to have been brought
about by an extraordinary conjunction of Saturn with the other planets,
which happened scarcely once in a thousand years. An astrologer and
physician, who witnessed its effects, Symon de Covino, has left a Latin
poem on the subject under the title _De Judicio Solis in Conviviis
Saturni_, in which he describes Saturn as indulging his malevolence towards
the human race by obtaining a judgment against men for their sins. This
opinion is alluded to in Piers Ploughman, l. 4453,

 "And so seide Saturne,
  And sente yow to warne."

The influence of this planet was represented by astrologers as being
peculiarly noxious, as is expressed in the following old distich:--

 "Jupiter atque Venus boni, Saturnusque malignus,
  Sol et Mercurius cum Luna sunt mediocres."

[7]

 "Qui male pastus erat fragili virtute ciborum,
  Labitur exiguo percussus flamine cladis:
  Indeque Saturni vulgus, pauperrima turba,
  Grata morte cadunt, quia vivere talibus est mors.
  Post quos lunares pereunt et mercuriales.
  Et sic debilior succumbit in ordine primo:
  Post alii tandem pestem secuntur eamdem.
  Sed dea principibus et nobilibus, generosis,
  Militibus, seu judicibus fera Parca pepercit.
  Raro cadunt tales, quia talibus est data vita
  Dulcis in hoc mundo, quam gloria laudat inanis."
                 _Symon de Covino_, in the _Bibliotheque de l'Ecole des
                               Chartes_, tom. ii. p 236.

[8] We have a very remarkable proof of the popularity of Piers Ploughman
with the lower orders (among whom probably parts of it were repeated by
memory), and of its influence on the insurrections of the peasantry in the
reign of Richard II., in the seditious letter of John Ball to the commons
of Essex, preserved by Thomas Walsingham (_Hist. Angl._ p. 275). I am not
sure if "John _Schep_" may not contain an allusion to the opening of the
poem; but the second passage, here printed in Italics, refers evidently to
Passus VI. and VII., and the third is an allusion to the characters of
Do-well and Do-best.

"John _Schep_ sometime Seint Mary priest of Yorke, and now of Colchester,
graeteth well John Namelesse, and John the Miller, and John Carter, and
biddeth them that they beware of guyle in borough, and stand together in
Gods name, and biddeth _Piers Plowman goe to his werke_, and chastise well
Hob the robber, and take with you John Trewman, and all his fellows, and no
moe. John the Miller hath y-ground, smal, small, small. The kings sonne of
heaven shal pay for all. Beware or ye be woe, know your frende fro your
foe. Have ynough, and say hoe: _And do well and better_, and flee sinne,
and seeke peace and holde you therin, and so biddeth John Trewman and all
his fellowes."

[9] The mention of Wycliffe and of Walter Brute and other circumstances,
fix the date of Piers Ploughman's Creed with tolerable certainty in the
latter years of the reign of Richard II. It was probably written very soon
after the year 1393, the date of the persecution of Walter Brute at
Hereford; and from the particular allusion to that person we may perhaps
suppose that like the Vision it was written on the Borders of Wales.

[10] Different circumstances connected with this poem (which also appears
to have been proscribed, for we have no early manuscript of it) lead me to
suppose that it was written in the reign of Henry IV., when the _burning_
of heretics came into fashion, which is alluded to in the following
stanza:--

 "Were Christ on earth here, eftsoone
  These would damne him to die:
  All his hestes they han for-done,
  And saine his sawes ben heresie:
  And ayenst his commaundements they crie,
  And _damne all his to be brende_;
  For it liketh not hem such losengerie,
  God almighty hem amend!"

In another passage, the writer of this poem alludes to the Creed of Piers
Ploughman as though he were the author of it, and as a piece then known to
everybody.

 "And all such other counterfaitours,
  Chanons, canons, and such disguised,
  Been Gods enemies and traitours,
  His true religion han foule despised.
  Of _freres_ I have told before,
  In a _making of a Crede_;
  And yet I could tell worse and more,
  But men would werien it to rede."

Perhaps, however, the writer only claims the authorship of the Creed in his
allegorical character, as the representative of that class of satirical
writers who were then attacking the monastic orders.

[11] We may enumerate the following as specimens of such works published in
the sixteenth century. Several similar publications appeared in the century
following.

"Pyers Plowmans Exortation vnto the lordes, knights, and burgoysses of the
parlyament house." 8vo. printed by Anthony Scholoker, in the reign of
Edward VI.

"Newes from the North, Otherwise called the Conference between Simon
Certain, and Pierce Plowman, faithfully collected and gathered by T. F.
Student." 4to. London, John Allde, 1579.

"The Plowmans complaint of sundry wicked livers, and especially of the bad
bringing vp of children; written in verse by R. B. printed for Hugh Corne,
1580." 8vo.

"A goodlye Dialogue and dysputacion between Pyers Ploweman and a Popish
Preest, c[=o]cernynge the Supper of the Lorde." 8vo, without date.

[12] Printed in the _Reliquiae Antiquae_, vol i. pp. 170-188. On the date
of this poem, see the _Biographia Britannica Literaria_ (by the editor of
the present work), Anglo-Saxon period, pp. 395, 396.

[13] Printed in the _Altdeutsche Blaetter_ von Moriz Haupt und Heinrich
Hoffmann, vol. ii. pp. 99-120, and in the _Reliquiae Antiquae_, vol. i. pp.
208-227.

[14] Discovered in a MS. at Worcester by Sir Thomas Phillipps, who
published a small edition of it, in folio.

[15] Edited by Sir Frederick Madden, for the Society of Antiquaries.

[16] Many instances of this will be found in my _Specimens of Lyric
Poetry_, composed in England in the reign of Edward the First (Percy
Society Publication).

[17] Such as _William and the Werwolf_, edited by Sir Frederick Madden; the
_Romance of Jerusalem_; that of _Alexander_; &c.

[18] MS. Harl. 2253. In this manuscript, and in several others which I have
seen the rhyming poems in short lines, whether in English, Latin, or
French, are arranged in this manner; and I have met with instances in which
part of a poem has been arranged in this way, and other parts of the same
poem have been arranged in short lines, to suit the scribe's convenience. I
have a strong impression of having met with an early English manuscript in
which a fragment of alliterative verse was written in short couplets.

[19] _Text I._ is from the edition now offered to the public: _Text II._
from that edited by Dr. Whitaker.

[20] The title of the second impression is, "The Vision of Pierce
Ploughman, nowe the seconde time imprinted by Roberte Crowley, dwellynge in
Elye rentes in Holburne. Whereunto are added certayne notes and cotations
in the mergyne gevynge light to the Reader, &c. Imprinted at London by
Roberte Crowley, dwellyng in Elye rentes in Holburne. The yere of our Lord
M.D.L. Cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum." 4to, 125 leaves.

[21] The title consists merely of the words "Pierce the Ploughman's Crede,"
upon a tablet in the midst of a wood-cut which had evidently been brought
from the continent. A fac-simile of the most important part of the cut is
given in Mr. Payne Collier's Bibliographical Catalogue of the Library of
Lord Francis Egerton, p. 235. The colophon, on a separate leaf, is
"Imprinted at London. By Reynold Wolfe. Anno Domini M.D.L.III." It consists
of 16 leaves in 4to.

[22] The title of this edition is, "The Vision of Pierce Plowman, newlye
imprynted after the authours olde copy, with a brefe summary of the
principall matters set before every part called Passus. Wherevnto is also
annexed the Crede of Pierce Plowman, neuer imprinted with the booke before.
P. Imprynted at London, by Owen Rogers, dwellyng neare vnto great Saint
Bartelmewes gate, at the sygne of the spred Egle. P. The yere of our Lord
God, a thousand, fyve hundred, thre score and one. The xxi. daye of the
Moneth of Februarye. Cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum." 4to. This
edition is not foliated, or paged; and it is remarkable that it is as
frequently found without the Creed, as with it. This edition of the Creed
is also sometimes found separate.

[23] Whitaker's edition bears the following title,--"Visio Willielmi de
Petro Plouhman, Item Visiones ejusdem de Dowel, Dobet, et Dobest. Or, The
Vision of William concerning Piers Plouhman, and The Visions of the same
concerning the Origin, Progress, and Perfection of Christian Life, &c. By
Thomas Dunham Whitaker, LL.D., &c." 4to. London. Murray, 1813.

[24] This manuscript was bought at Heber's sale for the British Museum,
where it is classed as Additional MS. No. 10,574.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy

opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
