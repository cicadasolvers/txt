YULE-TIDE--OLD AND NEW.

AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE CENTURY.

And they made merry in the good old fashion. The pictures on the walls
were covered with holly and mistletoe. They had come from British woods.
Then the tables groaned with Christmas cheer. The baron of beef was
flanked with plum-pudding and mince-pies. There never was a more jovial
crew. The compliments of the season were passed round, and the Christmas
Waits, singing their Christmas carols, were entertained right royally.
For was it not a time of peace and good will? Then there was a mighty
laugh. A huge joke had been perpetrated. Grandfather had been asleep,
and he was telling the youngsters, who had been playing a round game,
the character of his dream.

"I give you my word it is true," said the old man. "Yes, I actually
forgot it was Christmas!"

"But it was only in your dreams, Grandpapa," urged one of his
descendants.

"Yes, but that was bad enough," cried the old man in a tone of
self-reproach, "fancy forgetting Christmas--even in one's dreams!
Everything seems changing nowadays!"

But the Grandfather was wrong--the Christmas bills were unchangeable.
And ever will be!


AT THE END OF THE CENTURY.

And certainly it was dull enough in all conscience. Nowadays everything
is dull. Although it was towards the end of December, the room was
decorated with summer flowers. They had come from Algeria. Then the
side-table was spread with a _recherche_ repast, for they were all going
to dine _a la Russe_. But the guests were sad and thoroughly bored. They
had sent a policeman after the itinerant street-musicians, with the
desired result. Inside and outside silence reigned triumphant. Was it
not a time for "moving on" and threatening "six weeks without the option
of a fine"?

Then there was a deep groan. A young man--somebody's Grandson--suggested
a round game. At first the suggestion was received with derision.

"You can't get up a Missing Word Competition," said one. "No, my
Grandson, you can't."

"Can't I?" said the youngster, who had been called 'Grandson.' "Can't I?
Look here, I will write out a Word, and I will bet you none of you will
guess it."

And "Grandson" wrote out a Word on a piece of paper, and sealed it in a
packet. Then he called out the sentence, "The present season of the year
is known as----"

Then they all tried to guess it. Some one said "unfavourable," another
"pleasant," a third "dreary," and a fourth "troublesome."

But they all were wrong.

At last the sealed-up packet was produced, and opened. For the first
time there was a smile when the Word was known.

"Who would have thought of it?" was the cry.

The word chosen was "Christmas."

"Fancy anyone remembering Christmas! Even for a Missing Word
Competition! Everything seems changing nowadays!"

But the Grandson was wrong--his Christmas bills were unchangeable. And
ever will be!

"ART COMPETITIONS."

    "Since these competitions were started, the public had been educated
    in artistic matters, and their judgment was almost equal to that of
    the members of the Royal Academy."--_Mr. Poland's Speech in the
    "Missing Word" case._

  Mr. Poland said, at Bow Street,
    Choosing pictures thus imparts
  Judgment good as that of those treat-
    Ed as foremost in the arts.

  Hitherto each paid his shilling
    At the House of Burling_ton_,
  Gazed at pictures, feeble, thrilling,
    Bad or good, and wandered on--

  Stared with awe-struck admiration
    At "the Picture of the Year,"
  Gained artistic education
    In a stuffy atmosphere.

  Then all changed; he paid his shilling
    And he sent his coupon in
  To a weekly paper, willing
    To discriminate the tin;

  And be wisely praised or blamed, yet
    He knew nothing of design,
  The BRIDGE of Bow Street claimed yet
    One more shilling as a fine.

  Oh, rejoice, Academicians!
    Learned BRIDGE knew what to do;
  Artisans or mechanicians
    Might have grown as wise as you.

  Which would sadden any just man,
    And might make an angel weep--
  DICKSEE distanced by a dustman,
    STOREY staggered by a sweep!

  BOUGHTON beaten by a baker,
    Housemaids humbling helpless HOOK;
  STONE surpassed by sausage-maker,
    COOPER conquered by a cook!

  CROWE or CROFTS crushed by a cow-boy,
    MILLAIS made by milkmen mad,
  PETTIE plucked by any ploughboy,
    LEIGHTON licked by butcher's lad!

  It effected all you care for,
    But Sir JOHN has pulled you through;
  Bold Bow-Street's Beak is, therefore,
    No Bridge of Sighs for you

"A NOTE ON THE APPRECIATION OF GOLD."--Send a five-pound note (verified
by the Bank of England) to our office, and we will undertake to get it
changed _immediately_, and thereupon to hand over to the Bearer, in
exchange for the note, _two golden sovereigns, and one golden
half-sovereign, ready cash_. This will show what is _our_ appreciation
of gold.

"I confess it does seem to me that certain decisions made by a competent
tribunal hare rendered it extremely doubtful whether there is a single
one of the 670 gentlemen who now compose the House of Commons, who might
not find himself, by some accident, unseated, if a full investigation
were made into everything that had taken place in his constituency, say,
during the ten years preceding his candidature."--_Mr. Balfour at
Sheffield._

_M.P. (of any Party you please), loquitur:--_

  PHEW! It's all very fine, when you gather to dine,
    And to blow off the steam, while you blow off your 'bacca,
  (As the farmers of Aylesbury did, when their wine
    Was sweetened with "news from the Straits of Malacca");
  But things are much changed since the voters of Bucks
    Flushed red with loud fun at the phrases of DIZZY,
  And M.P.'s are dreadfully down on their lucks,
    Since BALFOUR'S confounded "tribunals" got busy.

  What precious stiff posers to loyal Primrosers
    Are offered by Rochester, Walsall, and Hexham!
  Platform perorators, post-prandial glosers,
    Must find many points to perplex 'em and vex 'em.
  It bothers a spouter who freely would flourish
    Coat-tails and mixed tropes at political dinners,
  When doubts of his safety he's driven to nourish,
    Through publicans rash and (electoral) sinners.

  Good lack, and good gracious! One may be veracious,
    And look with disgust upon bribes and forced bias,
  Yet owing to "Agents" more hot than sagacious,
    _Appear_ as _Autolycus-cum_-ANANIAS.
  One might just as soon be a Man-in-the-Moon,
    Or hark back at once to the style of Old Sarum.
  That Act (Corrupt Practices) may be a boon.
    But the way they apply it seems most harum-scarum.

  Should a would-be M.P. ask old ladies to tea,
    Or invite male supporters to crumpets or cricket;
  Should a snug Party Club prove a trifle too free,
    Or give an equivocal "treat," or hat-ticket;
  A seven years' nursing of Slopville-on-Slime,
    A well-fought Election and Glorious Victory
  (Crowed o'er by proud Party prints at the time)
    May--lose you your Seat. It does seem contradictory.

  Of course, my good friends, one would not say a word,
    Against England's glory--Electoral Purity!
  Suspect _me_ of slighting that boon? Too absurd!
    But what good's a Seat without _some_ small security.
  To fight tooth and nail, land a win, and then fail
    Along of dishon--I mean o'er-zealous "Agents"--
  Well, well, I don't wish at our Judges to rail,
    But--putting it plainly--I fear it won't pay, gents.

  'Tis hard to attend a political feast,
    And strut like a peacock, and crow like a bantam,
  Yet feel at one's back, like a blast from the east,
    A be-robed and be-wigged and blood-curdling law phantom.
  Stentorian cheers, and uproarious hear-hears,
    Though welcome, won't banish the sense of "wet-blanket"
  (That's INGOLDSBY'S rhyme), when Petition-bred fears
    Conjure up a grim Skeleton (Judge) at the Banquet!

THE SHORTEST DAY.

  SHORT verse
    We need,
  Most terse
    Indeed,
  That it--
    This lay--
  May fit
    This day.
  Short sight
    Of sun.
  Long night,
    Begun
  At four,
    Sunshine
  Once more
    At nine.
  A. M.
    Meets eyes
  Of them
    Who rise
  If no
    Fog hide--
  Then woe
    Betide;
  The day
    That ought
  To stay
    So short
  A space
    Can't show
  Its face
    Below.
  But when
    It goes,
  Why then
    One knows
  New Year
    Will soon
  Be here--
    Then June,
  So bright!
    So sweet!
  So light!
    We'll greet
  The day
    That's long
  With gay,
    Glad song--

  Excessively long-footed verse will undoubtedly characterise what
           we say,
  For LONGFELLOW'S longest lines skip along when we've long longed
           for the Longest Day.

THE LAST WORD.

(_A Domestic Drama of the Day before Yesterday._)


SCENE.--_The Breakfast Room at Linoleum Lodge, the suburban residence
of_ SAMUEL STODGEFORD, Esq. Mr. _and_ Mrs. STODGEFORD, _their son_
PARMENAS, _and daughters_ POMPILIA _and_ PRISCILLA, _discovered at
breakfast._

_Mr. Stodgeford._ We shall probably get it by the second post, and
though the delay is--ah--to some extent, annoying, we must not allow
ourselves to be unduly impatient. Personally, I regard these--ah--weekly
competitions as chiefly valuable in providing an innocent form of
domestic recreation, and an interesting example of the--ah--value of
words.

_Parmenas S._ The value of _one_ word, I should say, Father. Last week,
as there were very few who guessed right, it amounted to a considerable
sum.

_Mr. S._ That is a stimulant to ingenuity, no doubt, with some minds,
but let us put that aside. We feel some natural curiosity to know
whether we have selected the missing adjective, and I see no reason
myself to doubt that our united efforts will this time be crowned with
success.

_Pompilia._ It is almost impossible that it won't be _one_ of the two
hundred and fifty we sent in.

_Parmenas._ I drew up a list of synonyms which, I flatter myself, was
practically exhaustive.

_Priscilla._ I dreamt I heard a voice saying quite clearly in my ear,
"Nonsensical! nonsensical!"--like that--so I sent it in the first thing
next morning.

_Mr. S._ These--ah--supernatural monitions are not vouchsafed to us
without a purpose. It _may_ be "nonsensical."

_Mrs. S._ The only two words _I_ could think of were, "absurd" and
"idiotic," and I'm afraid they haven't much chance.

_Mr. S._ I wouldn't say that, SOPHRONIA. It is not always the most
appropriate epithet that--let me run over the paragraph again--where is
last week's paper? Ah, I have it. (_He procures it and reads with
unction._) "The lark, as has been frequently observed by the poets, is
in the habit of ascending to high altitudes in the exercise of his vocal
functions. Scientific meteorologists, it is true, do not consider that
there is any immediate danger of a descent of the sky, but many
bird-catchers of experience are of opinion that, should such a
contingency happen, the number of these feathered songsters included in
the catastrophe would, in all probability, be simply----" It might be
"idiotic," of course, but I fancy "incalculable," or "appalling" would
be nearer the mark.

_Parmenas._ Too obvious, _I_ should say. If you had adopted a few more
of the words I got from _Roget's Thesaurus_, we should have been safer.
Sending in a word like "disgusting" was sheer waste of one-and-twopence!
And as for POMPILIA, with her synonyms to "sensational," and PRISCILLA,
with her rubbishy superstition, depend upon it, _they_'re no good!

_Pompilia._ You think you know so much, because you've been to London
University--but _we've_ been to a High School; so we're not absolute
_idiots_. PARMENAS!

_Priscilla._ And I'm sure people have dreamt which horse was going to
win a race over and over again!

_Mr. S._ Come, come, let us have none of these unseemly disputes! And,
when you compare a literary competition with--ah--a mere gambling
transaction, PRISCILLA, you do a grave injustice to us all. You forget
that we have, all of us, worked hard for success; we have given our
whole thoughts and time to the subject. I have stayed at home from the
office day after day. Your mother has had no leisure for the cares of
the household; your brother has suspended his studies for his
approaching examination, and your elder sister her labours at the East
End--on purpose to devote our combined intelligence to the subject. And
are we to be told that we are no better than the brainless multitude who
speculate on horse-racing! I am not _angry_, my child, I am
only--(_Enter_ ROBERT, _the_ Page, _with a paper in a postal wrapper.)
Tiddler's Miscellany_--ha, at last! Why didn't you bring it up before,
Sir? You must have known it was important!

_Robert._ Please, Sir, it's on'y just come, Sir.

_Mr. S. (snatching the paper from him, and tearing it open; the other
members of the family crowd round excitedly)._ Now we shall see! Where's
the place? Confound the thing! Why can't they print the result in
a----(_His face falls._) What are you waiting for, Sir? Leave the room!

[_To_ ROBERT, _who has lingered about the sideboard._

_Robert._ Beg pardon, Sir, but would you mind reading out the
Word--'cause I'm----

_The Family._ Read the Word, Papa, do!

_Mr. S. (keeping the Journal)._ All in good time. (_Addressing_ ROBERT.)
Am I to understand, Sir, that you have actually had the presumption to
engage in this competition?--an uneducated young rascal like you!

_Robert._ I didn't mean no harm, Sir, I sent in nothink--it was on'y a
lark, Sir!

_The Family (dancing with suspense)._ Oh, never mind ROBERT now,
Father--do read out the Word!

_Mr. S. (ignoring their anxiety)._ If you sent in nothing, Sir, so much
the better. But, in case you should be tempted to such a piece of
infatuation in future, let me tell you this by way of--ah--warning. I
and my family, have, with every advantage that superior education and
abilities can bestow, sent in, after prolonged and careful deliberation,
no less than two hundred and fifty separate solutions, and not a single
one of these solutions, Sir, proves to be the correct one!

_The Family (collapsing on the nearest chairs)._ Oh, it can't be
true--one of them _must_ be right!

_Mr. S._ Unfortunately, they are not. I will read you the sentence as
completed. _(Reads.)_ "Should such a contingency happen, the number of
these feathered songsters included in the catastrophe would, in all
probability, be simply--ah--_nought_!" Now I venture to assert that
nothing short of--ah--absolute genius could possibly----(_To_ ROBERT.)
What do you mean by interrupting me, Sir?

_Robert._ Please, Sir, _I_ said nothink, Sir!

_Pompilia._ Oh, what _does_ it matter? Give me the paper, Papa. _(She
snatches it.)_ Oh, listen to this:--"The number of solutions sent in was
five hundred thousand, which means that twenty-five thousand pounds
remain for division. The only competitor who gave the correct solution
was Mr. ROBERT CONKLING, of Linoleum Lodge, Camberwell...." _Oh!_ Why,
that's _you_, ROBERT!

_Robert._ Yes, Miss, I told you I said "Nothink," Miss. I'm sure if I'd
thought----

_Mr. S. (gasping)._ Twenty-five thousand pounds! Ah, ROBERT, I trust you
will not forget that this piece of--ah--unmerited good fortune was
acquired by you under this humble roof. Shake hands, my boy!

_Pompilia._ Wait, Papa--don't shake hands till I've
done--_(continuing)--_"Mr. CONKLING, however, having elected to
disregard our conditions, requiring the solution to be written out in
full, and to express the word "Nought" by a cipher, we cannot consider
him legally entitled to the prize----"

_Mr. S._ How dare you use my private address for your illiterate
attempts, Sir?

_Prisc. (seizing the paper)._ Why don't you read it all?----"We are
prepared, nevertheless, to waive this informality, and a cheque for the
full amount of twenty-five thousand pounds, payable to his order, will
be forwarded to Mr. CONKLING accordingly----"

_Mr. S._ Well, ROBERT, you deserve it, I must say--shake
hands!--I--ah--_mean_ it.

_Robert._ Thankee, Sir, I'm sure--it was Cook and JANE 'elped me, Sir,
but--(_dolefully_)--I sold my chanst to the butcher-boy, for tuppence
and a mouth-orgin, Sir.

[Illustration: "I sold my Chanst to the Butcher-boy!"]

_Mr. S._ You unspeakable young idiot! But there, you will know better
another time; and now go out at once, and order five hundred copies of
_Tiddler_--a periodical which offers such intellectual
and--ah--substantial advantages, deserves some encouragement. (_Exit_
ROBERT.) Now Mother, PARMENAS, girls--all of you, let us set to work,
and see--just for the--ah--fun of the thing--if we can't be more
fortunate with the _next_ competition. We'll have Cook and JANE,
and--ah--ROBERT in to help; the housework can look after itself for once
... what is it _now_, PRISCILLA?

_Prisc. (faintly)._ I've just seen this. (_Reads._) "In consequence of
the recent decision at Bow Street, those who send solutions for this,
and any future competitions, will not be required to forward any
remittance with their coupons----"

_Mr. S._ (_approvingly_). An admirable arrangement--puts a stop at once
to any pernicious tendency to--ah--speculation!

_Prisc._ (_continuing_)--"and successful competitors must, we fear, be
content with no other reward than that of honourable mention."

_Mr. S._ Here, send after ROBERT, somebody! It's scandalous that the
precious time of a whole family should be frittered away in these
unedifying and--ah--idiotic competitions. I will not allow another
_Tiddler_ to enter my house!

_Robert_ (_entering with his arms full of "Tiddlers"_). Please, Sir, I
brought a 'undred, Sir, and they'll send up the rest as soon as ever
they----Oh Lor, Sir, I on'y done as I was told, Sir!

[_He is pounced upon, severely cuffed by a righteously indignant family,
and sent flying in a whirlwind of tattered "Tiddlers," as the Scene
closes._

MONTECARLOTTERY.

    [It remains true that for those who want a brief and exhilarating
    change, and are glad to reap for the nonce the harvest of a quiet
    eye, there are spots within the borders of England which, both in
    climate and in scenery, can vie with the proudest and most vaunted
    watering-places of the Sunny South."--_Daily Paper._]

_Damon on the Riviera, to Pythias at Torquay._--"Here I am, by the blue
Mediterranean! At least, the attendant of the sleeping-car says the
Mediterranean is somewhere about, only, as a violent rain-storm is going
on, we can't see it. Very tired by journey. Feel that, after all, you
were probably right in deciding to try the coast of Devonshire this
winter, instead of Riviera."

_Pythias at Torquay, to Damon at Nice._--"Coast of Devonshire
delightful, so far. Pleasant run down from London by G. W. R.--only five
hours. Thought of and pitied your crossing to Calais, and long
night-and-day journey after. You should just see our geraniums and
fuchsias, growing out-of-doors in winter! Mind and tell me in your next
how the olives and orange-trees look."

_Damon to Pythias._--"Olives all diseased--have not seen an orange-tree
yet--there is my reply to the query in your last. Hitherto I have not
had much opportunity of seeing anything, as the mistral has been
blowing, and it has been rather colder than England in March. Wretched
cold in my head. No decent fires--only pine-cones and logs to burn,
instead of coal! Wish I were at Torquay with you!"

_Pythias to Damon._--"Sorry to hear that Riviera is such a failure. More
pleased than ever with Devonshire. Glorious warm sunshine to-day.
Natives say they hardly ever have frost. Children digging on sand on
Christmas Eve--too hot for great-coat. Rain comes down occasionally, but
then it dries up in no time. Quite a little Earthly Paradise. Glad I
found it out."

_Later from Damon._--"Riviera better. Mistral gone. Sun warm, and have
seen my first orange-tree. Have also found that there's a place called
Monte Carlo near Nice. Have you ever heard of it? There's a Casino
there, where they have free concerts. Off there now!"

_Later from Pythias._--"After all, Devonshire _is_ sometimes a little
damp. Yes, I _have_ heard of Monte Carlo Casino, and I wish there was
anything of the sort at Torquay. Walks and drives pretty, but
monotonous. Hills annoying. Still, evidently far superior to any part of
Riviera.

_Still later from Damon._--"Glorious place, Monte Carlo. Superb grounds!
Scenery lovely, and Casinery still lovelier! And, between ourselves, I
have already more than paid for expenses of my trip by my winnings at
the Tables. No time for more just now. Must back the red!"

_Reply to above from Pythias._--"Very sorry to hear you have been
playing at the Tables. Sure to end in ruin. By the bye, what system do
you use? The subject interests me merely as a mathematical problem, of
course. Wish _I_ could pay expenses of my Devonshire hotel so easily.
But then one ought to have _some_ reward for visiting such a dreary
place as the Riviera, with its Mistrals, and diseased olive-trees, and
all that."

_Latest from Damon._--"Since writing my last letter, my views of the
Riviera have altered. The climate, I find, does not suit me. Sun doesn't
shine as much as I expected--not at night, for instance. Then the
existence of an olive disease anywhere near is naturally very
_degoutant_ (as they say here). And the Casino at Monte Carlo is simply
an organised swindle. It ought to be put down! After staking ten times
in succession on "Zero," and doubling my stake each time, I was
absolutely cleared out! Only just enough money to take me home. Shall
follow your example, and try Torquay for the rest of the winter."

_Latest from Pythias._--"Just a hasty line to say--_don't_ come to
Torquay! I am leaving it. Since I last wrote, my views of Devonshire
have also altered. Can't conceal from myself that the climate is a
mistake. Damp, dull, and depressing. Your account of Monte Carlo--_not_
the Casino, of course--so enchanting, that I've determined to try it.

THE MISSING WORD.

(_By a much-badgered Barmaid._)

  Each boobyish bar-lounger calls me "dear,"
    And "Misses" me in manner most absurd.
  I should not miss _him_! But the boss, I fear,
  Would miss his custom; so I still must hear
    His odious "Miss-ing" word!
  But oh! I'd sooner bear a monkey's kisses,
  Than some of these cheap mashers' mincing
    "Misses"!
  And there is one young ape!--I'd stand "two d"
  Could I hit him each time he "Misses" me!

QUEER QUERIES.

[Illustration: Notes]

AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL.--I should be glad to know whether it would be
advisable for me to write a book of "Reminiscences," as I see is now the
fashion. My life has been chiefly passed in a moorland-village in
Yorkshire, so that it has not been very eventful, and I have never
written anything before; still the public might like to hear my opinions
on things in general, and I think I could make the anecdote of how our
kitchen chimney once caught fire--which would be the most important
incident chronicled--rather thrilling. Among interesting and eminent
persons I have met, and of whom I could give some account in my
forthcoming work, are Mr. GLADSTONE (who passed through our station in a
train going at fifty miles an hour while I was on the platform), Lord
SALISBURY whom I met (under similar circumstances, and the back of whose
head I feel confident that I actually saw) and the LORD CHIEF JUSTICE of
England, who ordered an Usher to remove me from his Court at the Assizes
as I was (incorrectly) alleged to be snoring. I should be glad to hear
of any leading Publisher who would be likely to offer a good price for
such a book.--RUSTICUS EXPECTANS.

"CHRISTMAS IS COMING!"

  "Christmas _is_ coming!" Pleasant truth
    To all--save the dyspeptic!
  To most in whom some smack of youth
    Hath influence antiseptic.
  Pessimists prate, and prigs be-rate
    The time of mirth and holly;
  But why should time-soured sages "slate"
    The juvenile and jolly?
  "Though some churls at our mirth repine"
    (As old GEORGE WITHER put it),
  We'll whiff our weed, and sip our wine,
    And watch the youngsters foot it.
  They did so in quaint WITHER'S time,
    When wassail-bowls were humming,
  And still girls laugh, and church-bells chime,
    Because--"Christmas is coming!"

  "Christmas is coming!" Let him bring
    Mirth to the toiling million.
  What is't he bears--a gracious thing--
    Behind him on the pillion?
  Her snowy garb, and smile benign,
    Make sunshine in dark places;
  The gentlest, rarest, most divine
    Of all the Christian graces.
  Her eyes are full of loving light,
    Her hands with gifts are laden;
  True Yule-tide Almoner, of right,
    This _Una_-pure sweet maiden!
  She smiles on all, full-feeding mirth,
    Young love, mad motley mumming;
  There is loss dearth of joy on earth,
    Because--"Christmas is coming!"

  A Merry Christmas? Round each room
    That's writ in leaf and berry;
  But there be those, alas! to whom
    There's mockery in the "Merry."
  Merry?--when sorrow loads the heart,
    And nothing loads the larder?
  In the world's play the poor man's part
    At Yule-tide seems yet harder.
  Good cheer to him who hungry goes,
    And mirth to her who sorrows,
  Lend bitter chill to Christmas snows.
    Small joy care's bondsman borrows.
  From jollity he may not share,
    Despair is darkly drumming
  At his dull breast, whose hearth won't flare,
    Because--"Christmas is coming!"

  Good Greybeard Sire, you would not tire
    Gay youth with tales of trouble;
  World-gladness is your heart's desire,
    And so you're--riding double!
  Pleasant to see dear Charity
    Close pillion-poised behind you,
  Eager to bid her gifts fly free,
    We're happy so to find you.
  Ride on, and scatter largesse wide!
    Sore need is still no rarity,
  For all our Progress, Power, and Pride,
    We can't dispense with Charity.
  Ride on, kind pair, and may the air
    With happiness be humming,
  And poverty shake off despair,
    Because--"Christmas is coming!"

THE PORTER'S SLAM.

    [A meeting at Manchester has raised a protest against the nuisance
    caused by the needlessly loud "slamming" of railway carriage doors.]

  The porter has a patent "slam,"
    Which smites one like a blow,
  And everywhere that porter comes,
    That "slam" is sure to go.
  It strikes upon the tym-pa-num
    Like shock of dynamite;
  By day it nearly makes you dumb--
    It deafens you at night.
  When startled by that patent "slam,"
    The pious pas-sen-jare,
  Says something else that ends in "am,"
    (Or he has patience rare.)
  Not only does it cause a shock,
    But--Manchester remarks--
  "Depreciates the rolling stock,"
    Well, that is rather larks!
  _That_'s not the point. The porter's slam
    Conduces to insanity,
  And, though as mild as MARY's lamb,
    Drives men to loud profanity.
  If Manchester the "slam" can stay
    By raising of a stir,
  All railway-travellers will say,
    "Bully for Man-ches-ter!"

MIXED NOTIONS.--No. II. UGANDA.

SCENE--_As before, a Railway-carriage in a suburban morning train to
London. Persons also as before--namely, two_ Well-informed Men, _an_
Inquirer, _and an_ Average Man.

_First Well-informed Man_ (_laying down his paper_). So the Government's
going to stick to Uganda, after all. I had a notion, from the beginning,
they wouldn't be allowed to scuttle.

_Average Man._ Ah--I don't know that I'm particularly enthusiastic about
Uganda.

_Inquirer._ Why not?

_A. M._ What are we going to get out of it?--that's the question. We go
interfering all over the world, grabbing here, and grabbing there,
merely in order to keep other people out; and then some nigger King,
with a cold in his head, sneezes as he passes the Union Jack. That's an
insult to the flag, of course; so off goes an expedition, and, before
you know where you are, we've spent about ten millions, and added a few
thousand acres of swamp to the Empire. Why can't we leave things alone?
Haven't we got enough?

_First W. I. M._ That's all very well, I daresay; but you forget that
the Berlin Conference made Uganda one of our spheres of influence.

_Inquirer._ When was that?

_First W. I. M._ Why, just after the Franco-Prussian War. They all met
in Berlin to settle up everything--and we got Uganda.

_Inquirer._ I thought it was later than that, somehow.

_First W. I. M._ Well, anyhow, it was somewhere about that time. I don't
pledge myself to a year or two. But what I say about Uganda is this.
We're there--or rather the Company is--and we should simply disgrace
ourselves before the whole world if we chucked up the sponge now. And,
if we did, we should have France or Germany nipping in directly.

_Second W. I. M._ They can't.

_First W. I. M._ Why not?

_Second W. I. M._ Why not! Because it's our sphere of influence whatever
happens.

_Inquirer_ (_timidly_). I'm afraid you'll think me very ignorant, but I
don't quite know what a "sphere of influence" is. I've read a lot about
it lately, but I can't quite make it out.

_Second W. I. M._ (_condescendingly_). Yes, I know it's deuced difficult
to keep up with these new notions, unless you're in the way of hearing
all about them. Spheres of influence mean--well, don't you know, they
mean some country that's not quite yours, but it's more yours than
anybody else's, and if anybody else comes into it, you're allowed to
make a protocol of it. Besides, it gives you a right to the Hinterland,
you know.

_Inquirer_ (_dubiously_). Ah, I see. What's the Hinterland?

_Second W. I. M._ (_stumped_). I fancy it's about the most fertile part
of Africa. (_To First W. I. M._) Isn't it?

_First W. I. M._ Yes, that's it. It's the German for Highlands.

_Inquirer._ Of course, so it is. I might have thought of that.

_Average Man_ (_to First W. I. M._). Seems to me you've none of you got
hold of the right point. What I want to know is, does Uganda pay? LUGARD
says it don't; the Company hasn't made anything of it, and they've got
to go whether they like it or not; though I daresay they're deuced glad
to be out of the hole. But, if it don't pay, what on earth are we going
to do with it?

_Second W I. M._ (_triumphantly reinforcing him_). Yes, what on earth
are we to do with it?

_First W. I. M._ (_calmly, but contemptuously_). Ah! I see you're both
little-England men. From your point of view, I daresay you're right
enough. But I'm one of those who believe that we must stick on wherever
we've planted the flag. I agree with MOLTKE, that the nation that gives
up is in a state of decay.

_Second W. I. M._ It wasn't MOLTKE who said that; it was VICTOR HUGO, or
(_after a pause_) Lord PALMERSTON.

_First W. I. M._ Well, it doesn't matter who said it. The point is, it's
true. Besides, what are you going to do about the slaves and the
Missionaries?

_Average Man._ Oh, bother the Missionaries!

_First W. I. M._ It's all very well to say "bother the Missionaries!"
but that won't get you any further. They're our fellow-creatures after
all, and what's more, they're our fellow-countrymen, so we've got to
look after them.

_Average Man._ I should let the whole lot of Missionaries fight it out
together. They only keep quarrelling amongst themselves, and trying to
bag one another's converts; and then France and England get involved.

_Inquirer._ By the way, where is Uganda, exactly?

_First W. I. M._ Just behind Zanzibar--or somewhere about there. You can
get to it best from Mashonaland. Didn't you see that RHODES said he was
going to make a telegraph-line through there? It used to belong to the
SULTAN OF ZANZIBAR. Don't you remember?

_Inquirer._ Of course; so it did.

CHOOSING CHRISTMAS TOYS.

(_A Sketch in the Lowther Arcade._)


_Between the sloping banks of toys, and under a dense foliage of
coloured rosettes, calico banners, and Japanese-lanterns, the congested
Stream of Custom oozes slowly along, with an occasional overflow into
the backwaters of the shops behind, while the Stall-keepers keep up a
batrachian and almost automatic croak of invitation._

_Fond Grandmother._ So you've chosen a box of soldiers, have you,
FRANKY?--very well. Now what shall we get for little ELSIE and Baby?

_Franky (promptly)._ Another box of soldiers would do nicely for ELSIE,
Grandmamma, and--_I_ know, a fort for Baby!

_Grandm. (doubtfully)._ But they're such _little_ tots--they won't know
how to play with them.

_Franky._ Oh, but I can _teach_ them, you know, Grandmamma.

_Grandm._ That's right--I like to see a boy kind to his little sisters.

[_She adopts_ Master FRANKY'S _disinterested suggestion._

_A Mother._ Now, PERCY, it's all nonsense--you _can't_ want any more
toys--those you've got are as good as new. (_To her Friend._) He's such
a boy for taking care of his things--he'll hardly trust his toys out of
their boxes, and won't allow anyone else to _touch_ them!

_The Friend._ Dear little fellow--then I'm sure he _deserves_ to be
given a new toy for being so careful!

_The Mother._ Well, he'll give me no peace till I _do_ give him
something. I know--but mind this, PERCY, it's only to keep you quiet,
and I'm not going to buy EDDIE anything. _(To Friend.)_ He gives all
_his_ things away as it is! [Master PERCY _takes both these valuable
moral lessons to heart_.

_Mrs. Stilton (to her less prosperous Sister-in-law_, Mrs. BLOOMOLD).
Nonsense, VINNIE, I won't _hear_ of it! REGGIE has more toys already
than he knows what to do with!

_Mrs. Bloom. (apologetically)._ Of course, my dear SOPHIA, I know your
children are born to every----but still, I have no one but myself
_now_, you know--and if I _might_--it would be such a _pleasure_!

_Mrs. Stilton._ I have already told you there is not the slightest
occasion for your spending your money in any such foolish manner. I hope
that is enough.

_Mrs. Bloom._ I'm sure he would like one of these little
water-carts--now _wouldn't_ you, REGGIE? [REGGIE _assents shyly_.

_Mrs. Stilton._ Buy him one, by all means--he will probably take the
colour out of my new carpets with it--but, of course, _that_'s of no
consequence to _you_!

_Mrs. Bloom._ Oh dear, I _quite_ forgot your beautiful carpets. No, to
be sure, that might----but one of those little butcher's shops,
now!--they're really _quite_ cheap!

_Mrs. S._ _I_ always thought cheapness was a question of what a person
could _afford_.

_Mrs. Bloom._ But I _can_ afford it, dear SOPHIA--thanks to dear JOHN'S
bounty, and--and _yours_.

_Mrs. S._ You mustn't thank _me_. _I_ had nothing to do with it. I
warned JOHN at the time that it would only----and it seems I was right.
And REGGIE has a butcher's shop--a really good one--already. In fact, I
couldn't tell you what he _hasn't_ got!

_Reggie._ _I_ can, though, Aunt VINNIE. I haven't got a train, for _one_
thing! (_To his Mother, as she drags him on._) I _should_ like a little
tin train, to go by clockwork on rails so. Do let Auntie----what's she
staying behind for?

_Mrs. Bloom. (catching them up, and thrusting a box into_ REGGIE'S
_hands)._ There, dear boy, there's your train--with Aunt VINNIE'S love!
(REGGIE _opens the box, and discovers a wooden train_.) What's the
matter, darling? Isn't it----?

_Mrs. S._ He had rather set his heart on a clockwork one with
rails--which I was thinking of getting for him--but I am sure he's very
much obliged to his Aunt all the same--_aren't_ you, REGINALD?

_Reggie (with a fortunate inspiration)._ Thank you _ever_ so much,
Auntie! And I like this train better than a tin one--because all the
doors open really--it's _exactly_ what I wanted!

_Mrs. S._ That's so like REGGIE--he never says anything to hurt people's
feelings if he can possibly help it.

_Mrs. B. (with meek ambiguity)._ Ah, dear SOPHIA, you set him such an
_example_, you see! (REGGIE _wonders why she squeezes his hand so_.)

[Illustration: "Er--I want a Toy of some sort--for a _Child_, don't you
know!"]

_A Vague Man (to Saleswoman)._ Er--I want a toy of some sort--for a
_child_, don't you know. (_As if he might require it for an elderly
person._) At least, it's not _exactly_ a child--it can _talk_, and all
that.

_Salesw._ Will you step inside, Sir? We've a large assortment within to
select from. Is it for a boy or a girl?

_The Vague Man._ It's a boy--that is, its name's EVELYN--of course,
that's a girl's name too; but it had better be some thing that
doesn't--I mean something it can't----[_He runs down._

_Salesw._ I _quite_ understand, Sir. One of these little 'orses and
carts are a very nice present for a child--(_with languid
commendation_)--the little 'orse takes out and all.

_The V. M._ Um--yes--but I want something more--a different _kind_ of
thing altogether.

_Salesw._ We sell a great many of these rag-dolls; all the clothes take
off and on.

_The V. M._ Isn't that rather----and then, for a boy, eh?

_Salesw._ P'raps a box of wooden soldiers _would_ be a more suitable toy
for a boy, certainly.

_The V. M._ Soldiers, eh?--yes--but you see, it might turn out to be a
girl after all--and then----

_Salesw._ I see, you want something that would do equally well for
either. _Here_'s a toy now. (_She brings out a team of little tin swans
on wheels._) You fix a stick in the end--so--and wheel it in front of
you, and all the little swans go up and down.

[_She wheels it up and down without enthusiasm._

_The V. M. (inspecting it feebly)._ Oh--the swans go up and down, eh? It
isn't quite--but very likely it won't--May as well have that as
something else--Yes, you can send it to--let me see--is it Hampstead or
Notting Hill they're living at now? (_To the_ Saleswoman, _who naturally
cannot assist him._) No, of course, _you_ wouldn't know. Never mind,
I'll take it with me--don't trouble to wrap it up!

[_He carries it off--to forget it promptly in a hansom._

_A Genial Uncle (entering with Nephews and Nieces)._ Plenty to choose
from here, eh? Look about and see what you'd like best.

_Jane (the eldest, sixteen, and "quite a little woman")._ I'm sure they
would much rather _you_ chose for them, Uncle!

_Uncle._ Bless me, _I_ don't know what boys and girls like
nowadays--they must choose for themselves!

_Salesw. (wearily)._ Perhaps one of the young gentlemen would like a
dredging-machine? The handle turns, you see, and all the little buckets
go round the chain and take up sand or mud--or there's a fire-engine,
_that's_ a nice toy, throws a stream of real water.

[TOMMY, _aged eleven, is charmed with the dredging-machine, while the
fire-engine finds favour in the eyes of_ BOBBY, _aged nine._

_Jane (thoughtfully)._ I'm afraid the dredging-machine is rather a
_messy_ toy, Uncle, and the fire-engine wouldn't do at all, either--it
would be sure to encourage them to play with fire. BOBBY, if you say
"blow!" once more, I shall tell Mother. Uncle is the best judge of
what's suitable for you!

_Uncle._ Well, there's something in what you say, JENNY. We must see if
we can't find something better, that's all.

_Salesw._ I've a little Toy-stige, 'ere--with scenes and characters in
"_Richard Cured o' Lyin'_" complete and ready for acting--how would that
do?

[TOMMY _and_ BOBBY _cheer up visibly at this suggestion._

_Jane._ I _don't_ think Mother would like them to have _that_, Uncle--it
might give them a _taste_ for theatres, you know!

_Uncle._ Ha--so it might--very thoughtful of you, JANE--Mustn't get in
your Mother's bad books; never do! What's in these boxes? soldiers? How
about these, eh, boys? [_The boys are again consoled._

_Jane (gently)._ They're getting _rather_ too big for such babyish
things as soldiers, Uncle! I tell you what _I_ think--if you got a nice
puzzle-map for TOMMY--he's so backward in his Geography--and a drawing
slate for BOBBY, who's getting on so nicely with his drawing, and a
little work-box--not an _expensive_ one, of course--for WINNIE, that
would be _quite_----

[_These sisterly counsels are rewarded by ungrateful and rebellious
roars._

_Uncle._ TOMMY, did I hear you address your sister as a "beast"?
Come--come! And what are you all turning on the waterworks for, eh?
Strikes me, JANE, you haven't _quite_ hit off their tastes!

_Jane (virtuously)._ I have only told you what I know Mother would
_wish_ them to have, Uncle; and, even if I _am_ to have my ankles kicked
for it, I'm sure I'm right!

_Uncle._ Always a consolation, my dear JENNY. I'm sure no nephew of
_mine_ would kick his sister, except by the merest accident--so let's
say no more of that. But it's no use getting 'em what they don't like;
so suppose we stick to the fire-engine, and the other concern--theatre
is it, JOHNNY?--Very well--and don't you get _me_ into trouble over 'em,
that's all. And WINNIE would like a doll, eh?--that's all right. Now
everybody's provided for--except JANE!

_Jane (frostily)._ Thank you, Uncle--but you seem to forget I'm not
_exactly_ a child! [_She walks out of the shop with dignity._

_Uncle._ Hullo! Put my foot in it again! But we can't leave JENNY out of
it--_can_ we? Must get her a present of some sort over the way.... Here,
TOMMY, my boy, you can tell me something she'd like.

_Bobby (later--to_ TOMMY). What did you tell Uncle to get for JANE?

_Tommy (with an unholy chuckle)._ Why, a box with one of those
puff-things in it. Don't you know how we caught her powdering her nose
with Mother's? And Uncle _got_ her one too! _Won't_ she be shirty just!

[_They walk out in an ecstasy of anticipation, as Scene closes._

MR. PUNCH'S Paragraphist says, "he was never good at dates," not even
when served in dishes, for they're dry at the best; but, of the very
newest and best kind of Date Cards, MARCUS WARD & Co. have a capital
selection. Among them the _Grandfather's Clock_ makes a pretty screen,
and, being a clock, is, of course, always up to the time of day.

    The Baron's Diarist and Date Examiner makes the following exhaustive
    notes:--first that Mr. C. LETTS describes some of his _Pocket
    Diaries_ as "The Improved." There is nothing so good but what it
    could be better. Lett's admit this, and be satisfied with the latest
    edition of Letts' Annuals, which are prizes, though, until Jan. 1,

"A most sweet story! A most charming story!!" gurgled the Baron, as,
with sobs in his inner voice, talking to himself, he finished the
penultimate chapter of _Dolly_. "Now, Mrs. BURNETT, if you dare to kill
your heroine, I swear I'll never forgive you, and never read another of
your fatally-fascinating books." The Baron trembled as he commenced the
last chapter of the simplest, most natural, most touching, and most
exquisitely-told story he has read for many a day. How would it end? A
few lines sufficed. "Bless you, Mrs. BURNETT!" snivelled the Baron, not
ashamed of dabbing his eyes with his kerchief. "Bless you, Ma'am! You
have let 'em live! May your new book go to countless editions! May it be
another _Little Lord Fauntleroy_, and may you reap a golden reward for
this, your masterpiece of simple work, your latest story--_Dolly!_" The
Baron is bound ("bound in morocco" as the slaves were, poor wretches!)
to add that he wishes it had not been illustrated, for, as good wine
needs no bush, so a perfect story, such as is this, needs no
illustration; nay, is rather injured by it than not. There is only one
small item of common-place in it, and that is making the would-be
seducer a married man. Of course, to prove him so was the easiest and
shortest way of saving his vain and feather-headed little victim.
Perhaps an alternative would have involved complication, and might have
marred the natural simplicity of the story. So critically the Baron
states his one very small objection, and reverts with the utmost
pleasure to the hours he spent over the tale, absorbed in every page, in
every line of it; and herewith doth he, not only most strongly, but most
earnestly recommend everyone to procure this book (published by E. WARNE
& Co.), for it is one that can be and must be given a place of honour by
the side of DICKENS and THACKERAY, to be read again and again, here a
bit and there a bit, when other works of fiction now enjoying a greater
literary reputation (though 'twould be difficult to name them), shall be
relegated to the lowest shelves of books that have had their day.

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
