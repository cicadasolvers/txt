NOTE.


The following catalogue of the collections made during 1879 was prepared
for the First Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology, but owing to
want of space was not included in that volume. Before the necessity of
this action was made apparent the matter had been stereotyped and it was
impossible to change the figure numbers, etc. This will explain the
seeming irregularity in the numbering of the figures--the first one of
this paper following the last one of the above-mentioned report. The
second catalogue, that of the collection of 1880, also included in this
volume, has been made to correspond with the first, the figure numbers
following in regular order.


LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL

  WASHINGTON, _January 3, 1881_.

SIR: I have the honor to submit herewith an illustrated catalogue
exhibiting in part the results of the ethnologic and archaeologic
explorations made under your direction in New Mexico and Arizona during
the summer of 1879.

As you are already familiar with the mode of travel and the labor
necessary in making such investigations and explorations, as well as the
incidents common to such undertakings, and as I do not consider them of
any special interest or value to the catalogue, I have omitted such
details.

I beg, however, in this connection, to refer to the services of Messrs.
F. H. Cushing, ethnologist of the Smithsonian Institution, and J. K.
Hillers, photographic artist of the Bureau of Ethnology, both of whom
accompanied me on the expedition.

Mr. Cushing's duties were performed with intelligence and zeal
throughout. After the field-work of the season was completed he remained
with the Indians for the purpose of studying the habits, customs,
manners, political and religious organizations, and language of the
people; also to explore the ancient caves of that region. His inquiries
will prove of the utmost interest and importance to science. Mr. Hillers
labored with equal zeal and energy. His work is of the greatest value in
illustrating some of the most interesting features of our
investigations. He made a large series of negatives depicting nearly
every feature of the Pueblo villages and their inhabitants. The beauty
and perfection of the photographs themselves fully attest the value and
importance of his work.

I would extend most cordial thanks to General Sherman for the special
interest he manifested in our work, and for directions given by him to
the officers of the Army serving in the West to assist us in carrying
out the objects of the expedition; and to the officers who so cordially
rendered such aid.

To General Edward Hatch, commanding the district of New Mexico, we are
indebted for valuable information and material assistance, which were
liberally granted, and to which in great part our success was due. The
party also received valuable aid from Gen. George P. Buell, U.S.A., who
was in command at Fort Wingate during our work at Zuni, for which I am
pleased to extend thanks. The large number and variety of objects
collected by the members of the expedition, and the many difficulties
incident to such undertakings, as well as the limited time devoted to
the preparation of the catalogue, will account for any imperfections it
may contain.

Hoping, however, that, notwithstanding these, it may serve useful ends
in the continuation of such work,

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

      JAMES STEVENSON.

Prof. J. W. POWELL,

  _Director Bureau of Ethnology_.

INTRODUCTION


It is not my intention in the present paper--which is simply what it
purports to be, a _catalogue_--to attempt any discussion of the habits,
customs, or domestic life of the Indian tribes from whom the articles
were obtained; nor to enter upon a general comparison of the pottery and
other objects with articles of a like character of other, nations or
tribes. Occasionally attention may be called to striking resemblances
between certain articles and those of other countries, where such
comparison will aid in illustrating form or character.

The collection contains two thousand eight hundred and fifty-eight
specimens. Although it consists very largely of vessels and other
articles of pottery, yet it embraces almost every object necessary to
illustrate the domestic life and art of the tribes from whom the largest
number of the specimens were obtained. It includes, in addition to
pottery, implements of war and hunting, articles used in domestic
manufactures, articles of clothing and personal adornment, basketry,
trappings for horses, images, toys, stone implements, musical
instruments, and those used in games and religious ceremonies, woven
fabrics, foods prepared and unprepared, paints for decorating pottery
and other objects, earths of which their pottery is manufactured,
mineral pigments, medicines, vegetable dyestuffs, &c. But the chief
value of the collection is undoubtedly the great variety of vessels and
other articles of pottery which it contains. In this respect it is
perhaps the most complete that has been made from the pueblos. Quite a
number of articles of this group may perhaps be properly classed as
"ancient," and were obtained more or less uninjured; but by far the
larger portion are of modern manufacture.


ARTICLES OF STONE.

These consist of pestles and mortars for grinding pigments; circular
mortars, in which certain articles of food are bruised or ground;
_metates_, or stones used for grinding wheat and corn; axes, hatchets,
celts, mauls, scrapers &c.

The cutting, splitting, pounding, perforating, and scraping implements
are generally derived from schists, basaltic, trachytic, and porphyritic
rocks, and those for grinding and crushing foods are more or less
composed of coarse lava and compact sandstones. Quite a number of the
metate rubbing stones and a large number of the axes are composed of a
very hard, heavy, and curiously mottled rock, a specimen of which was
submitted to Dr. George W. Hawes, Curator of Mineralogy to the National
Museum, for examination, and of which he says:

"This rock, which was so extensively employed by the Pueblo Indians for
the manufacture of various utensils, has proved to be composed largely
of quartz, intermingled with which is a fine, fibrous, radiated
substance, the optical properties of which demonstrate it to be
fibrolite. In addition, the rock is filled with minute crystals of
octahedral form which are composed of magnetite, and scattered through
the rock are minute yellow crystals of rutile. The red coloration which
these specimens possess is due to thin films of hematite. The rock is
therefore fibrolite schist, and from a lithological standpoint it is
very interesting. The fibrolite imparts the toughness to the rock,
which, I should judge, would increase its value for the purposes to
which the Indians applied it."

The axes, hatchets, mauls, and other implements used for cutting,
splitting, or piercing are generally more or less imperfect, worn,
chipped, or otherwise injured. This condition is to be accounted for by
the fact that they are all of ancient manufacture; an implement of this
kind being rarely, if ever, made by the Indians at the present day. They
are usually of a hard volcanic rock, not employed by the present
inhabitants in the manufacture of implements. They have in most cases
been collected from the ruins of the Mesa and Cliff dwellers, by whose
ancestors they were probably made. I was unable to learn of a single
instance in which one of these had been made by the modern Indians. In
nearly all cases the edges, once sharp and used for cutting, splitting,
or piercing, are much worn and blunt from use in pounding or other
purposes than that for which they were originally intended. On more than
one occasion I have observed a woman using the edge of a handsome stone
axe in pulverizing volcanic rock to mix with clay for making pottery.
Nearly all the edged stone implements are thus injured. Those showing
the greatest perfection were either too small to utilize in this manner
or had but recently been discovered when we obtained them.

The grinders and mortars are frequently found composed of softer rock,
either ferruginous sandstone or gritty clays. For a more complete
knowledge of these stone implements we must depend on a comparative
study of large collections from different localities, and such
information as the circumstances attending their discovery may impart,
rather than upon their present condition or the uses for which they are
now employed.

Metates or grain-grinders, pestles and rubbing stones belong to the
milling industry among the Indians. The metates are generally quite
large and heavy, and could not well be transported with the limited
means at the command of Indians. They are therefore well adapted to the
uses of village Indians, who remain permanently in a place and prosecute
agricultural pursuits. They are generally of rectangular shape, and from
10 to 20 inches in length by 6 to 12 in width, and are composed of
various kinds of rock, the harder, coarse-grained kinds being
preferable, though in some instances sandstone is employed; the most
desirable stone is porous lava. These stones are sometimes carried with
families of the Pueblos moving short distances to the valleys of streams
in which they have farms in cultivation. In the permanent villages they
are arranged in small rectangular bins (see Fig. 508), each about 20
inches wide and deep, the whole series ranging from 5 to 10 feet in
length, according to the number of bins or divisions. The walls are
usually of sandstone. In each compartment one of these metates or
grinding stones is firmly set at a proper angle to make it convenient to
the kneeling female grinder. In this arrangement of the slabs those of
different degrees of texture are so placed as to produce an increased
degree of fineness to the meal or flour as it is passed from one to the
other. But a small number of these slabs were collected on account of
their great weight. Accompanying these metates are long, slim, flat
stones, which are rubbed up and down the slabs, thus crushing the grain.
These hand-stones are worn longitudinally into various shapes; some have
two flat sides, while the third side remains oval. The same variety
exists in regard to the texture of these rubbing-stones, as in the
concave grinders.

The pueblo of Zuni, from which the most important portion of the
collection was obtained, is situated in New Mexico, near the western
border, about two hundred miles southwest from Santa Fe.

At the time of Coronado's visit to this country the pueblo was located
at what is now known as "Old Zuni," on the summit of a high _mesa_. The
modern Zuni is situated upon a knoll in the valley of the Zuni River,
about two miles from the site of the old town. Certain writers have
regarded Zuni, or rather "Old Zuni," as one of the "Seven Cities of
Cibola." The evidences found at and around both the old and present Zuni
are certainly not sufficient to warrant this view, and further and more
careful investigations are necessary.

Zuni, although lying on the line of travel of military expeditions,
emigrant trains, and trade between the Pacific coast and the Rio Grande,
the foreigners visiting them have seldom remained long in their village;
nor has the advancing wave of Caucasian settlement approached
sufficiently near to exert any marked influence on their manners and
customs; at least the form and decoration of their pottery bear no
marked evidence of the influence of the more highly civilized races.

The collection made here by the expedition was more extensive than that
from any other place, and numbers about fifteen hundred objects, of
which by far the larger part is composed of earthenware articles. These
include large and small water vases, canteens of various sizes and
shapes, cooking cups, and pottery baskets used in their dances,
paint-pots, ladles, water jugs, eating bowls, spoons, pepper and salt
boxes, pitchers, bread-bowls, Navajo water jugs, treasure boxes, water
vases, cups, cooking pots, skillets, ancient pottery, animals, and
grotesque images. It belongs mostly to the variety of cream-white
pottery, decorated in black and brown colors; a portion is red ware,
with color decorations in black. There are also several pieces without
ornamentation, and one or two pieces of black ware, but the latter were
most probably obtained from other tribes, and possibly the same is true
in reference to a few pieces of other kinds which present unusual
figures or forms.

A slight glance at the figures depicted on the _tinajas_, or water
vases, will suffice to show any one who has examined the older pottery
of this region, specimens and fragments of which are found among the
ruins, that a marked change has taken place in their ideas of beauty.
Although the rigid, angular, zigzag, and geometric figures are yet found
in their decorations, they have largely given way to carved lines,
rounded figures, and attempts to represent natural objects.

A few apparently conventional figures are still generally retained, as
around the outside of the necks of the vases and on the outer surface of
the bowls, probably suggested originally by the rigid outlines of their
arid country, and in fact by their buildings. The figure of the elk or
deer is a very marked feature in the ornamentation of their white ware,
and is often found under an arch. Another very common figure is that of
a grotesquely-shaped bird, found also on the necks of water vases and
the outer surface of bowls.


ARTICLES OF CLAY.

Tinajas, or water vases, are called in the Zuni tongue
_tk[-a]h-wi-n[-a]-k[-a]-t[-e]hl-le_. They are usually from 8 to 12
inches in height, and from 12 to 15 in diameter. A smaller size of the
same form of vessels, which are from 5 to 7 inches in height and from
8 to 10 in diameter, are called _det-ts[-a]n-n[-a]_. They are of three
colors, cream white, polished red, and black: there are in the
collection comparatively few of the second, and but one of the last
variety. The decorations are chiefly in black and brown, but four or
five pieces being in black. The decorations of the cream-white group
present some four general types--those represented by Figs. 359, 363,
364, and ----, in which the uncolored circular space forms the
distinguishing characteristic; those of which Fig. 360 may be considered
a representative, of which type there are but two specimens in the
collection; those represented by Fig. 361, and those distinguished by
the rosette (see Figs. 366, 367, 368, and 370).

The following appear to be unique: (39935) Fig. 371, (40785) Fig. 375,
(41149) Fig. 372, and (41167) Fig. 374.

By a careful study of these decorations we find that they consist
chiefly of the following figures, which are combined in various ways:
triangular figures, usually on the neck; large open circles, frequently
in a diamond figure, as in Fig. 359 (39871); scrolls; or arches as in
Figs. 361, 362, &c.

In no instance do we find the meander or Greek fret on these, or in fact
any other Zuni vessels. A marked characteristic of the decorations on
the pottery of this pueblo is the absence of vines and floral figures so
common on those of some of the other pueblos. The nearest approach to
the vine is the double line of scrolls seen in (40785) Fig. 375.
Although the checkered figure is common on bowls, the Zuni artists have
appreciated the fact that it would be out of place on the convex surface
of the water vase. The elks or deer--for it is difficult to tell which
are intended--are usually marked with a circular or crescent-shaped
spot, in white, on the rump, and a red diamond placed over the region of
the heart, with a line of the same color extending from it to the mouth,
both margined with white; the head of the animal is always toward the
right.

As will be observed by examining the decorated pieces, the surface is
divided into zones by lines--sometimes single, sometimes double, but
generally slender--one near the base, one or two around the middle, one
at the shoulder, and one at the rim; thus forming one zone embracing the
neck, and two or three on the body, exclusive of the undecorated base.
Sometimes there is but one zone on the body as seen in Figs. 364 (40322)
and 359 (39871); sometimes two, as shown in Figs. 367 (40317) and 370
(41146); but often three, the middle one quite narrow, as seen in Figs.
361 (39934) and 362 (41150). Although not always shown in the figures,
the lines at the rim, shoulder, and bottom are seldom wanting in Zuni
vases. The zones are often interrupted by broad perpendicular stripes or
inclosed spaces in which circles, scroll figures, or rosettes are
inserted.

Measurements of these vessels show considerable uniformity of
proportion, the widely exceptional specimens being also exceptional in
decorations. As indicating size and proportion I give here the
measurements of some typical as well as some abnormal specimens.

The figures show the height, the diameter of the body at the widest
part, and the diameter of the mouth in inches.

If we reduce these to proportion, using the diameter of body as the unit
of measurement, the result is as follows:

  +--------+--------+-----------++--------+--------+-----------+
  | Number.| Height.| Diameter  || Number.| Height.| Diameter  |
  |        |        | of mouth. ||        |        | of mouth. |

From this it will be seen that No. 148, which is represented by Fig. 373
(39774), is unusually broad in proportion to the height. Nos. 152 and
153 vary to the extreme in the other direction; No. 153 is shown in
Fig. 364 (40322). Excluding these and taking the means of the large and
small kinds separately we find the average ratios to be as follows:

          Height.  Diameter
                   of mouth.
  Large     .78       .57
  Small     .78       .61

Most of the water jugs of both the Shinumos and Zunians are in the form
of canteens, usually more or less spherical, and varying in capacity
from a pint to four gallons. On each side there is a small handle in the
form of a loop or knob, through or around which is placed a small shawl
or strip of cloth, or a cord long enough to pass over the forehead so as
to suspend the vessel against the back just below the shoulders. The
other jugs are of various fanciful shapes, which will be noted in the
catalogue. A large portion are of plain brown ware, a few plain white,
and others white with colored decorations. Various names are used
apparently to designate the different kinds rather than the uses for
which they are intended.

The decorations, when present, are always on the upper side, which is
more convex than the lower, or side on which it is intended the vessel
shall lie when not in use. In the ornamented white ware the lower
portion is usually red or brown.

As all these clay fabrics are the work of North American Indians, it is
scarcely necessary for me to say that they are unglazed, a
characteristic, so far as I am aware, of all aboriginal pottery.

Some of the specimens, especially of the black ware, show a smooth
finish, and may perhaps, without violence to the term, be classed as
lustrous. This is not the effect of a varnish or partial glazing, but is
a polish, produced generally, if not always, by rubbing with a polishing
stone.

Although, as a rule, the paste of which the ware is made is
comparatively free from foreign matter, yet many pieces, especially of
the decorated ware, when broken, show little whitish or ash-colored
specks. These, when found in aboriginal pottery east of the Mississippi,
have, I believe, been without question considered as fragments or
particles of shell broken up and mixed with the paste. This may be
correct in reference to the pottery found east of and in the Mississippi
Valley, but this whitish and grayish matter in the pottery of the
Indians of New Mexico and Arizona is in most cases pulverized pottery,
which is crushed and mixed with the paste. Black lava is sometimes
crushed and used in the same manner.

The principal material used is a clay, apparently in its natural state,
varying in color according to locality. Although comparatively free from
pebbles or lumps of foreign matter, we detect in some of the coarser
specimens small particles of mica and grains of other materials, and in
one broken specimen the elytron of a small coleopterous insect. But as a
general rule, the paste appears to have been free from foreign matter.

A slight glance at this large collection is sufficient to show that the
potters worked by no specific rule, and that they did not use patterns.
While it is apparent that only a few general forms were adopted, and
that, with few exceptions, the entire collection may be grouped by
these, yet no two specimens are exactly alike; they differ in size, or
vary more or less in form. The same thing is also true in reference to
the ornamentation: while there is a striking similarity in general
characteristics, there is an endless variety in details. No two similar
pieces can be found bearing precisely the same ornamental pattern.

Much the larger portion of the collection consists of vessels of various
kinds, such as bowls, cooking utensils, canteens, bottles, jars,
pitchers, cups, ladles, jugs, water vases, ornamental vessels,
paint-pots, &c. These vary in size from the large vase, capable of
holding ten gallons, to the little cup and canteen, which will contain
less than half a pint. The other and much smaller portion includes all
those articles which cannot be classed as vessels, such as images, toys,
toilet articles, representations of animals, &c. The collection can
perhaps be most satisfactorily classified by reference to the coloring,
ornamentation, and quality, thus:

1. _The red or uncolored pottery_, which is without ornamentation of any
kind. Some of this is coarse and rough, and in this case always more
than ordinarily thick; but the larger portion has the surface smooth and
often polished. The color varies from the natural dull leaden hue of the
clay, to a bright brick red, the latter largely predominating.

2. _The brown ware_, or that which shows an admixture of mica. This,
although uniformly without color decorations, is occasionally marked
with impressed figures and lines. Although inferior in quality, being
coarse and fragile, it presents more symmetrical though less varied
forms than are usually found in the preceding group. The influence of
contact with the European races is here very apparent, as, for example,
in the true pitcher and other common utensils and an apparent attempt at
glazing.

3. _The black ware_ which is without ornamentation. This variety in
quality and character is precisely like the polished red of the first
group; but is slightly in advance of that in regard to finish, and
perhaps, as heretofore remarked, may be classed as lustrous, while the
red may be classed as semi-lustrous. The paste of which this black ware
is formed appears to have been better prepared than that of the
preceding varieties, and is the hardest and firmest in the collection.

4. _The cream-white pottery decorated in colors_. This extensive group,
which includes fully two-thirds of the entire collection, embraces
almost every known form of earthenware manufactured by the tribes from
whom it was obtained. The paste of which it is formed is similar in
character to that of the black ware. When broken the fracture shows very
distinctly the effect of burning, the interior being of the natural
leaden color, shading off to a dull grayish white as it approaches the
outer surface. The opaque or creamy-white color of the surface is
produced by a coating of opaque whitewash. Upon this white surface the
figures are afterwards drawn.

The only colors used in decorating pottery are black, red, and some
shade of brown. But of this we will speak more fully when we come to
describe the peculiar methods practiced by the different tribes in
making and adorning pottery.

Although there is a strong general similarity in this colored
ornamentation, the great variety of details renders it difficult to
classify the figures so as to convey a correct idea of them to the
reader. We shall therefore have to refer him to the numerous cuts and
the colored plates which have been introduced for the purpose of
illustrating the catalogue.

The following general statement is about all that can be said in
reference to them before descending to specific details.

So far as the coloring is concerned they are of two kinds, those having
the figures wholly black, and those which are partly black and partly
brown or red. The differences in the decorated pottery appear to be
always accompanied by certain other variations sufficient to warrant
speaking of them as different varieties or groups. The former (those
having the figures wholly black), which are made of the ordinary plastic
blue clay, have only the upper half or two-thirds of the body of the
vessel overlaid with the white coating for receiving the decorations,
the lower part being uncoated, and of the natural pale red or salmon
color produced by burning, but usually well polished. As additional
distinguishing features of this group we notice that the shape is more
generally globular, the workmanship rather superior, and the pottery
somewhat harder and less friable than that of the other group; the
angular and geometrical figures formed by straight lines are more common
in this group; here we also find the meander or Greek fret correctly
drawn, the vine, and several other designs rarely or never found in the
other group. The figures of animals, which are common to both varieties,
are in the former more usually distributed in zones or groups, while in
the latter they are generally placed singly in inclosed spaces. The
latter variety, in which we see the curve freely used, shows an evident
advance over the ornamentation of the older pottery of this region; and
while the figures must be classed as rude, and the outlines are less
sharp, and not so well defined as in the older specimens, yet they
indicate clearly a mental advance in the greater variety of conception.

The figures of this entire class, as regards forms, may be grouped under
three general headings: first, the geometrical, which is the most
common; second, the figures of animals; and, third, rude attempts at
floral decorations, which forms are rather rare. Strange to say, in but
few instances can any attempt at representing the human form or any part
of it be discovered in these color decorations.

The geometric figures present an endless variety; but we notice, as is
shown by the cuts and plates, that triangles with an elongate acuminate
apex and the zigzag are very common in the black-brown decorations. The
checkered figure also is not uncommon. The animals most frequently
represented are the elk or deer and birds. The floral decorations are
chiefly vines well drawn, and rude attempts at representing trees, and
the flowers of various species of _Helianthus_.

5. _Red ware with color decorations_. This ware is represented by but
few vessels, which are in every respect similar to the best variety of
the red pottery heretofore mentioned, except that it is marked with
figures in black, many of which are decorated only on the upper portions
around the neck or rim.

6. _The ancient pottery_, of which Figs. 680 (40816) and 693 (40817) are
good examples.

The Pueblo tribes of New Mexico and Arizona, with rare exceptions,
manufacture earthenware vessels for domestic use. The Pueblo of Taos may
be mentioned as one of these exceptions; although the manner of living,
the general habits, and characteristics of the tribe are similar to
those of the other Pueblo Indians, and although they make use of pottery
for domestic purposes, they do not manufacture it. Some pieces, such as
water jars and vessels used for cooking, are made in the village, but
this occurs only in such families as have intermarried with other tribes
where the manufacture of the native ware is carried on.

The Pueblos among whom the manufacture of pottery or earthenware
utensils may be classed as a conspicuous feature of their peculiar
civilization at the present time, are situated geographically as
follows: San Juan, Santa Clara, San Ildefonso, Cochiti, Santo Domingo,
San Felipe, Sandia, and Isleta, located on the Rio Grande; Pojake,
Tesuke, Nambe, Jamez, Zia or Silla, Santa Ana, Laguna, and Acoma,
situated on the tributaries of the Rio Grande; Zuni, and some small
pueblos of the same tribe all within the borders of New Mexico. Zuni
however is located on the Rio Zuni, which flows into the Little Colorado
River.

The Moki pueblos, numbering seven in all, are embraced in what is called
the Province of Tusyan, and are located within the Territory of Arizona,
near its northeastern corner.

The Zunians and Shinumos, although situated farther from civilized
people and less influenced by their usages than any of the other Indians
mentioned, surpass all the other tribes in the manufacture of all kinds
of earthenware. The collections made from these tribes, as will be seen
by reference to the catalogue, exceed, both in number and variety, those
from all the others combined. The collection as enumerated in the
catalogue includes specimens from all the pueblos referred to.

Although the uses of these articles are to a great extent the same among
all the Pueblo tribes, and the shapes and forms are apparently similar,
yet to the experienced eye there is no difficulty in detecting the
peculiarities which distinguish one from the other, or at least in
assigning them to the tribes with which they originated.

It will be observed by reference both to the colored and wood-cut
illustrations that there are special distinctions between the
ornamentation of the pottery of the pueblos of the Rio Grande Valley and
of those situated on the tributaries of the Rio Colorado. In the
decorations of the former the birds and vine are conspicuous and
constantly recurring features, while in the Zuni and Shinumo pottery the
elk, domestic animals, and birds peculiar to these arid regions are the
figures most frequently used. The difference is easily accounted for
when we are informed of the fact that the former tribes reside in the
valley of the Rio Grande, which is well adapted to the culture of the
grape as well as other crops. The ever-present vine and the numerous
birds which flock to this fertile valley will naturally suggest figures
for decoration. On the other hand, the Zunians and Shinumos reside in
regions almost destitute of water, and hence without any attractive
vegetation; therefore their designs are drawn chiefly from the sharp
outlines of their dwellings, their domestic animals, birds, and the elk
and antelope that graze in the little grassy oases. None of these are
actually drawn from nature, but from imagination and memory, as they
never have an object before them in molding or painting.

In none of the cases referred to do we observe any attempts to imitate
the exact forms or ceramic designs of the so-called ancient pottery,
fragments and sometimes entire vessels of which are found throughout
this southwestern region. This seems strange from the fact that in the
use of stone implements we find but few which are the result of their
own handiwork. The old ruins are searched, and from them, and the debris
about them, stone pestles, mortars, hammers, hatchets, rubbing stones,
scrapers, picks, spear and arrow heads, and polishing stones are
collected by the inhabitants of nearly all the pueblos, and are kept and
used by them.

The clay mostly used by the Zunians in the manufacture of pottery is a
dark, bluish, carbonaceous, clayey shale found in layers usually near
the tops of the mesas. Several of these elevated mesas are situated near
Zuni, from which the natives obtain this material. This carbonaceous
clay is first mixed with water and then kneaded as a baker kneads dough
until it reaches the proper consistency; with this, crushed volcanic
lava is sometimes mixed; but the Zunians more frequently pulverize
fragments of broken pottery, which have been preserved for this purpose.
This seems to prevent explosion, cracking, or fracture by rendering the
paste sufficiently porous to allow the heat to pass through without
injurious effect. When the clayey dough is ready to be used a sufficient
quantity is rolled into a ball. The dough, if worked by a careful
artist, is first tested as to its fitness for molding by putting a piece
of the paste to the tongue, the sensitiveness of which is such as to
detect any gritty substance or particles, when the fingers fail to do
so. The ball is hollowed out with the fingers into the shape of a bowl
(this form constituting the foundation for all varieties of earthenware)
and assumes the desired form by the addition of strips of the clay; all
traces of the addition of each strip are removed before another is
added, by the use of a small trowel fashioned from a piece of gourd or
fragment of pottery, the only tool employed in the manufacture of
pottery.

The bottoms of old water jars and bowls form stands for the articles
while being worked by the potter. The bowls are filled with sand when
objects of a globular form are to be made. Although I have often watched
the process, yet in no instance have I ever observed the use of a
potter's wheel, measuring instrument, or model of any kind. The makers,
who are always females, depend entirely on memory and skill derived from
practice to accomplish their work. The vessels when completely formed
are laid in some convenient place to sun-dry. A paint or solution is
then made, either of a fine white calcareous earth, consisting mainly of
carbonate of lime, or of a milk-white indurated clay, almost wholly
insoluble in acids, and apparently derived from decomposed feldspar with
a small proportion of mica. This solution is applied to the surface of
the vessel and allowed to dry; it is then ready for the decorations.

The pigments from which the paints are derived for decorative purposes
are also found in the vicinity of the mesas, and are employed by the
Indians in the production of two colors, each of which varies slightly
according to the intensity of heat in the process of baking, or the
manner in which it is applied. One varies from a black to a
blackish-brown, the other from a light brick red to a dark dull red
color. The material which produces these colors is generally found in a
hard, stony condition, and is ground in a small stone mortar, just as we
reduce India ink for use. When the pigment is properly reduced, and
mixed with water so as to form a thin solution, it is applied with
brushes made of the leaves of the yucca. These brushes are made of flat
pieces of the leaf, which are stripped off and bruised at one end, and
are of different sizes adapted to the coarse or fine lines the artist
may wish to draw. In this manner all the decorations on the pottery are
produced.

The substance used in producing the black ware is a clayey brown
hematite, or ferruginous indurated clay, quite hard. The material used
to produce the red or brown colors is a yellowish impure clay, colored
from oxide of iron; indeed it is mainly clay, but contains some sand and
a very small amount of carbonate of lime. These are the principal
ingredients and methods involved in the manufacture of Zuni pottery.

The method practiced by the Zunians in baking pottery differs somewhat
from that employed by the tribes who make quantities of black and red
ware. It seems to be a necessity on the part of the Zunians to observe
the greatest care in this operation. Their pottery is nearly all
decorated and must be baked free from contact with the peculiar fuel
used for that purpose. During the baking process it sometimes happens
that a piece of the fuel, which is composed of dried manure carefully
built up oven-shaped around the vessels to be baked, falls against the
vessel. In every such instance a carbonized or smoky spot is left on the
jar or bowl, which is regarded by the Indians as a blemish. The kiln is
carefully watched until the fuel is thoroughly burnt to a white ash,
when the vessels can be removed without danger of such blemishes.

The mode of manufacturing pottery adopted at the pueblos of the Rio
Grande Valley is quite similar to that described as practiced by the
Zuni, Shinumo, Acoma, and Laguna Indians, but there is considerable
difference in the method of decorating and polishing. Polishing is
practiced chiefly by the Indians of the eastern pueblos, and but little
by those of the more western region.

The pueblos of Santa Clara, Cochiti, San Juan, Tesuke, &c., manufacture
large quantities of pottery for sale in addition to that made for their
own use. It is in these eastern pueblos that the black polished ware is
chiefly found, and it is in the production of this class of ware that
the chief difference in the ceramic art between the two sections exists.
The clays used in the manufacture of this ware are of the same character
as those of which the other is made; the paste is prepared in the same
way, so that when the vessels are formed and ready for the kiln they are
of the color of the original clay. In other words, the change to the
black color is not produced in making the paste or in moulding or
forming the vessel, but during the process of baking. The manner of
forming the vessel is the same as with the western tribes; and when,
formed it is dried in the sun in the same way; after this a solution of
very fine ochre-colored clay is applied to the outside and inside near
the top, or to such parts of the surface as are to be polished. While
this solution thus applied is still moist, the process of polishing
begins by rubbing the parts thus washed with smooth, fine-grained stones
until quite dry and glossy. The parts thus rubbed still retain the
original red color of the clay. The vessels are again placed in the sun
and allowed to become thoroughly dry, when they are ready for baking. It
is in this part of the process that the great differences in color are
produced. The vessels are placed together in a heap on a level spot of
ground and carefully covered over with coarsely broken dried manure
obtained from the corrals. The kiln thus formed is then ignited at
several points.

It is proper to add here that the clays used by the Santa Clara Indians
are of a brick-red color, containing an admixture of very fine sand,
which, no doubt, prevents cracking in burning, and hence dispenses with
the necessity of using lava or pottery fragments, as is the custom of
the Indians of the western pueblos. The burning is carried on until a
sufficient degree of heat is obtained properly to bake the vessels,
which still retain their original red brick color. At this juncture such
of the vessels as it is desired have remain in that condition are
removed from the fire and allowed to cool, when they are ready for use.
Those which the artists intend to color black are allowed to remain and
another application of fuel, finely pulverized, is made, completely
covering and smothering the fire. This produces a dense, dark smoke, a
portion of which is absorbed by the baking vessels and gives them the
desired black color. It is in this manner that the black ware of these
eastern pueblos is produced.

It is said that among the Cochiti, Santa Clara, and some other Pueblos a
vegetable matter is employed to produce some of their decorative
designs; this, however, I was unable to verify, though some of the
Indians assured me of the fact, and furnished me a bunch of the plant,
which Dr. Vasey, of the Agricultural Department, found to be _Cleome
integrifolia_, a plant common throughout the Western Territories. A few
specimens of the ware, some burnt and some unburnt, said to be decorated
with the oil or juice of this plant were secured.

As heretofore remarked, notwithstanding the variety in ornamentation,
there are really but few different figures, and these are mostly quite
simple. Any one interested in the study of Indian art can find in the
figures and plates of this catalogue all the original conceptions of the
artists of the Pueblo Indians as depicted by them.

While it is of value in the study of ethnology, and as affording a means
of comparison in the study of archaeology, there is nothing in the
composition or ornamentation, or in the form of the vessels, that
ceramic artists of the civilized races would desire to copy.

As a means of reference in the study of ancient American pottery, I
consider the collection invaluable, as it can scarcely be possible that
the forms and decorations contain nothing that has been handed down from
a former age. Although the figures used have no symbolic characters
connected with them in the mind of the modern artist, yet it is more
than probable that at least some of them did have such a meaning to the
ancient artists. For example, the little tadpole-shaped figure on the
clay baskets used in their dances and sacred ceremonies by the Zunians
is understood by them to represent a little water articulate, which, as
heretofore stated, is probably the larva of some insect or crustacean,
very common in the pools and sluggish streams of the country inhabited
by these Indians. Now, it is possible that this figure has been used
with the same meaning from time immemorial, but I find, as pointed out
to me by Prof. Cyrus Thomas, that almost exactly the same figure is on a
vessel pictured on Plate VII of the manuscript Troano, where a religious
ceremony of some kind is evidently represented. The same figure is also
found in Landa's character for the Maya day _Cib_, a word signifying
copal, a gum or resin formerly used in religious ceremonies as incense.
I find also on Plate XXXV of the same manuscript the figures of bowls or
pots with legs similar to those of the Zuni. I do not point out these
resemblances as proof of any relation between the two races, but as mere
illustrations of what possibly may be learned by a careful study of the
forms and decorations of this pottery. It may also be well to add here
another fact to which Professor Thomas calls my attention, viz., the
similarity between the manner of wearing the hair by the Shinumo women,
_i.e._, in knots at the side, as represented by the female images, and
that of the ancient Maya women, as shown in numerous figures on the
manuscript Troano. Any one familiar with General Cesnola's collection
from Cyprus cannot fail to be reminded of it when he examines this
collection of Indian pottery; especially the colors used and the general
character of the specimens; but an inspection of the two collections is
necessary in order to have this general resemblance brought to mind, as
it does not appear so distinctly on a comparison of the published
figures only. The figures on Plate XLIV of his "Cyprus" bear quite a
striking resemblance to those on some specimens of Cochiti ware. The
quadruple cup, Fig. 25, page 406, is almost exactly like the Zuni
quadruple cups, and was probably used for the same purpose. The same
type of multiple cups is also shown in Plate IX of the same work. The
two tea-pot-like vessels represented on Plate VIII, as well as the two
bird-shaped pieces on the same plate, are much, like the similar vessels
of Cochiti pottery, several of which are figured in this catalogue.

The resemblance of this Indian ware, in the form of the vessels, to that
found in the ancient mounds of this country is so marked that it is
scarcely necessary to remind the reader of the fact, but it may be well
to call attention to the much, larger proportion of water vessels among
the Indian pottery than is seen in collections from the mounds. This,
however, may perhaps be accounted for by the scarcity of water in the
western region.

The custom of the Zuni artists of making a diamond or triangle over the
region of the heart of the elk and deer figures with a line running to
the mouth, although somewhat singular, is quite consistent with the
Indian practice of symbolic writing. I was informed by the Zuni Indians
that it was intended to denote that "the mouth speaks from the heart." A
similar mark occurs in the decoration of the vase figured in Cesnola's
"Cyprus," page 268.

Contemporaneous and somewhat closely related tribes may use widely
different figures in the decoration of their ware, and hence it is
unsafe, in studying ancient specimens, to draw hasty conclusions from
slight differences in this respect; and I think I may also safely add
that a comparatively short period of time, a century or so at most, may
suffice to bring about a great change in the same tribe in the form and
manner of decorating their pottery. It also shows us that the ware of a
given tribe, which does not bear the impress of civilized influence,
can, by a careful study, be distinguished in nearly all cases from that
of any other tribe. I feel so confident of the truth of this statement,
that I would not hesitate to undertake to pick out all pieces of Zuni
ornamented ware from a collection of thousands of specimens of modern
Pueblo Indian pottery if indiscriminately mixed together.

The Shinumo pottery in general appearance and form bears a strong
resemblance to that of Zuni; in fact it is almost impossible to separate
the ornamented bowls and water vases of the two if mingled together.
There are certain figures found in the one which never occur in the
other, but there are a number of designs, especially of those most
generally seen, that are quite common to the pottery of both tribes.

The different varieties of ware, the red or brown without decorations,
the white with decorations, and the black are in general use with the
tribe, and specimens of each are contained in the collection. But few
specimens of the purely micaceous ware are found, either in Zuni or
Wolpi.

The preponderance of the large round water jugs in the Shinumo
collection over that of Zuni is noticeable. This form of vessel seems
to be more in use by tribes whose villages are quite remote from water
or which are situated on high mesas difficult of access. The kinds of
vessels, however, which are common with the Zunians are also common with
the Shinumos, and those intended for the same use are generally of the
same shape or similar in form. But, as with the decorations, there are
also vessels so markedly distinct and variant from those we find at Zuni
as to show very readily at least tribal distinctions between the ceramic
artists and manufacturers.

The proximity of Laguna to Acoma led us to anticipate what we afterward
found, viz., a great similarity in the forms of their vessels, and
also in their manner of ornamentation. The principal differences consist
in the more profuse use of the forms of birds and flowers, the first
evidently representing prairie grouse and the last some form of
sunflower. There is an absence of the geometrical forms, of lines
and angles commonly observed on the works of more distant pueblos.

Quite a number of animal representations, made hollow for use as
drinking vessels, were obtained, displaying grotesquely imitative forms
of deer, elk, sheep, big-horn, antelope, and other animals with which
they are familiar. All of these objects have more color laid on them
than is to be found on the pottery of their neighbors of Acoma, the
birds and animals being painted in a light rufous fawn color not in use
elsewhere, and the only instance of the employment of green is on a
tinaja of this pueblo used in coloring some foliage.


VEGETAL SUBSTANCES.

This class of ware comprises a very diversified group of objects;
indeed, so great is the variety that I will not attempt a general
description of them. Specific reference will be made to the objects
as they occur in their places in the catalogue.

The objects of basketry or wicker-work are quite varied in form,
construction, and decoration. Those made by the Zuni Indians are so rude
and coarse as not to entitle them to any merit. The larger baskets made
by this tribe are used for carrying corn, melons, peppers, &c. The
smaller are used for holding beans, shelled corn, and other coarse
small materials.

The basketry of the Shinumos is of a finer and more finished quality.
Among these are many jug or canteen shaped baskets, from which, no
doubt, many of the forms of their pottery water vessels have been
copied. These are sometimes globular, with large round bodies and small
necks. They are generally very closely woven and are then coated over
with a resin or gum which renders them capable of holding water. Like
some of their water jugs, in pottery, they have small horsehair ears
or loops attached to the sides through which strings are passed for
carrying them either over the head or shoulder. This class of water jug
basketry all show evidences of age, and it is possible that they were
manufactured by the Apaches or other tribes skilled in the art. The flat
kinds are designed to hold fine grain and meal, and are also frequently
used for winnowing. This is done by placing a small quantity of grain in
the basket, and by a skillful motion throwing the grain up into the wind
and again catching it as it comes down. This motion is kept up until the
wind has separated the chaff from, the grain. Many of the flat baskets
are decorated in colors, as will be seen by the accompanying
illustrations.

It is quite probable that most of the finer ware of this class is
manufactured by the Apache Indians, who are celebrated for this work,
and finds its way among the Pueblos through the medium of barter.

The basketry of the Zunians is usually made of small round willows and
the stem of the yucca, the leaves of which attain a long slender growth
in that region. It is quite certain that the basketry used for holding
water is not manufactured by the Zunians, and probably not by the
Shinumos, though many are found with them.

As previously stated, the basketry manufactured by the Shinumo Indians
is of a more finished class and of a greater variety than that made and
used by any of the other Pueblos, as will be seen by reference to the
accompanying illustrations. Among the examples of this ware, obtained at
Wolpi, is a large number of the flat or saucer-shaped kind; these vary
both in size and character of construction as well as decoration. The
manner of making one form of this class is quite interesting as well as
curious. A rope-like withe of the fiber of the yucca, made quite fine,
is wrapped with flat strips of the same plant. In forming the basket
with this rope the workman commences at the center, or bottom, and
coils the rope round, attaching it by a method of weaving, until, by
successive layers of the rope, it attains the desired dimensions. These
are quite highly and prettily ornamented in black, white, and yellow,
and are compact and strong. Another variety of baskets of similar shape
and size, and also fancifully ornamented, was obtained from the same
Indians. These are made from small round willows. They exhibit less
skill in construction, but are handsomely ornamented. Another kind was
also obtained from the Shinumos, which, however, are attributed to the
Apaches and probably found their way into the Moki villages through
trade. These are large bowl-shaped baskets, almost watertight, but
generally used as flour and meal baskets. They are also ornamented
black and yellow, produced by weaving the material of different colors
together while making the basket.

There are many other forms and varieties, which will be referred to at
the proper time, as they occur in the catalogue.

The Pueblos employ a variety of plants and herbs for medicinal and
dyeing purposes, some of which were collected. Their botanical names
were not determined, but they are indigenous to the regions inhabited
by the Indians using them.

Ornaments and musical instruments employed in dances and religious
ceremonies do not differ much among the Pueblo Indians; the principal
ones being the drum, rattle, notched sticks, a kind of fife, and a
turtle-shell rattle. The latter instrument is the shell of a turtle,
around the edges of which the toes of goats and calves are attached;
this produces a very peculiar rattling sound. The shell is usually
attached to the leg near the knee.

  (41259); sandstone rubber.

_MORTARS, PESTLES, ETC._

These are found in use at all the pueblos, but are more common in Zuni
and the Moki villages than elsewhere, as these Indians use mineral
pigments more extensively and in greater variety than any of the others.

The pestles and mortars obtained from these tribes are all too small to
be used for any other purpose than grinding pigments. Many of them
appear to be quite old, and were probably handed down from distant
ancestors, or obtained from the ruins. Some of them are evidently of
modern manufacture.

83. (40707). Mortar; a round, flat, quartzitic boulder with round cavity
  on one side about one inch in diameter and half an inch deep, and a
  square depression on the other about an inch deep and two inches in
  width; indigo still clinging to the surface of the depression.

84. (40708). Mortar of quartzite, the body nearly square and flat;
  depression round and about four inches in diameter, quite shallow.

85. (40709). Mortar of coarse-grained sandstone, almost perfectly round,
  the cavity quite deep, and lined with red ochre or vermilion.

86. (40710). Mortar of a flat sandstone with irregular rim about four

87. (40711). Paint mortar of a small round quartz boulder.

88. (40712). Mortar of fine-grained sandstone about six inches long by
  three wide; sides square. This mortar was in use by the Zunians for
  the purpose of grinding a pigment of yellowish impure clay, colored by
  the oxide of iron, with which they decorate their pottery, and which
  produces the brown and reddish-brown colors.

89. (40713). Small mortar of sandstone.

90. (40714). Mortar made from a flat water-worn quartz boulder with a
  circular depression about half an inch deep. The bottom of this mortar
  shows evidence of its having been used as a grinding stone previous to
  being converted into a mortar, or it may have been used for both
  purposes, as both the paint cavity and the rubbing side show recent
  use.

91. (40715). Paint mortar of basalt, used for grinding the yellow
  pigment for ornamenting pottery; about four inches in diameter, cavity
  about one inch deep, bottom ground flat.

92. (40716). Flat paint mortar, of quartz rock, almost round, about an
  inch thick, depression quite shallow; used for grinding a pigment of
  azurite or carbonate of copper, small nodules of which they collect
  at copper mines. This pigment is used in painting and decorating
  wooden images and gods.

  sandstone, used for grinding or mixing vermilion.

96. (40720). Paint mortar of sandstone. The whole mortar is only about
  an inch thick; made from a section of an old metate rubber.

97. (40722). Paint mortar of quartzite; blue pigment grinder. Size about
  four by three inches. This, like many of the flat mortars, has been
  first used as a rubbing stone and subsequently converted into a paint
  mortar.

98. (40723). Mortar made from a quartz boulder.

99. (40724). Sandstone mortar.

100. (40725). Paint mortar of sandstone, very flat.

101. (40726). Paint mortar, with oblong shallow depression; sandstone.

102. (40728). Square paint mortar; cavity about half an inch deep;
  sandstone impregnated with iron. Quartzitic pestle accompanying it.

103. (40729). Paint mortar of quartzite; almost square; depression
  almost worn through by use; quartz pebble pestle accompanying it.

104. (40730). Small round paint mortar of basalt, with white quartz
  pebble pestle.

105. (40731). Fig. 353. Paint mortar and pestle of quartz, with a knob
  on the end, which serves as a handle. This mortar was used in grinding
  an azurite pigment.

106. (40732). Mortar shaped somewhat like a ladle; the projecting end is
  provided with a small groove out of which the paint is poured.

107. (40733). Small sandstone mortar.

108. (40864). Paint mortar of sandstone.

109. (40868). Paint mortar of basalt, almost square.

110. (40869). Flat, square sandstone paint mortar; black water-worn
  pebble for pestle.

111. (40907). Chili or red pepper mortar of very porous lava rock; oval
  bottom, shallow cavity, about four inches thick and eight in diameter.
  These lava mortars may have been used for other purposes, but at the
  present time the Indians use them in crushing the pods and seeds of
  red pepper, and occasionally for crushing parched corn. They are quite
  common.

112. (40908). Food mortar of lava rock; square with flat bottom.
  Mortars of this kind are used in crushing grain and seeds.

113. (42272). Fig. 358. Paint mortar of very hard, fine-grained
  sandstone. The specimen is a very fair type of all the square paint
  mortars and pestles. The depression is often square instead of round.
  In grinding pigments the Indians generally move the pestle backward
  and forward instead of around as is done by our druggists.

114. (41273). Small sandstone paint mortar, much like the preceding.

115. (40227). Small egg-shaped paint pestle of white quartz. The general
  name of these in Zuni is _[ae]h-sh[)o]c-t[-o]n-ne_.

116. (42276). Flat sandstone, circular and about five inches in
  diameter; used as a quoit; originally a rubbing stone.

_MISCELLANEOUS OBJECTS._

117. (39755). Eight specimens not very well defined. They are flint
  flakes, showing, by their shape, that they were designed for scrapers
  and groovers, being flat or slightly concave on one side and oval on
  the other.

118. (41289). Fig. 356. This is a sandstone mould for shaping metal
  into such forms as suit the fancy of the Indians for bridle and other
  ornaments; one cavity is rectangular, about four inches long by one in
  width; the other about two inches in diameter. Silver, which has long
  been a metal of traffic among these tribes, is the one which is
  usually melted down for ornamental purposes. After it is taken from
  the mould it is beaten thin, then polished.

119. (41290). Is a portion of the same mould, with one cavity square and
  the other in the shape of a spear-head.

120, 121. (42266), Fig. 354, and (42267), are crucibles, which were used
  in connection with the moulds for melting silver and other metals.
  Many other ornaments are made in the same manner.

122. (40808). Fig. 357. This is a large, rudely chipped spear-head
  of mica schist, obtained at Zuni, which was carried in the hand
  of one of the performers in a dance. It does not show any
  evidences of having been used in any other way. They called it
  _[ae]h'-chi-[ae]n-t[-e]h-[ae]-hla_.

123. (42245). Fig. 355. Handsomely-shaped and well-polished skinning
  knife of a remarkably fine-grained silicious slate. Above the
  shoulders on one side it is worn off to an oval surface, and is flat
  on the other.

124. (40915). Round sandstone, which is called a gaming stone; it is
  quite round, and bears the same name in Zuni as the pestle,
  _[-a]h-k[ae]-mon-ne_.

125. (40916). Quartz stone, flat and rounded at the ends as a sort of
  last to keep moccasins in shape while being sewed; called
  _y[ae]'-l[)i]n-ne_.

126. (41239). String of alabaster beads, _tem-thla_.

127. (41240). Charm, representing the upper part of the body and head of
  a bird.

128. (41241). Charm; representing a horse; quartz.

129. (41242). Charm; bird's head and upper part of body.

135. (40870). Disk of sandstone, slightly convex in the centre; used in
  games.

136. (42325). Flat sandstone slab, with the horns of male and female
  deer engraved on one side.

137, 138. (40721) and (41249). Flat sandstones, used for baking
_wi-a-vi_, a thin, wafer-like bread, by heating the rocks and then
spreading a gruel-like mixture of corn meal over them. The largest one
of these stones is about three feet in length by two in width. They are
used by the Zuni and Moki pueblos quite extensively.

139. (42324). Eighty chip flints and flakes of agate, quartz,
  chalcedony, &c.


ARTICLES OF CLAY.

_WATER VASES._

140. (39871). Form and decorations shown in Fig. 359. The slender
  shading lines only are brown, the rest of the figuring black; the base
  in this as in most Zuni pottery is reddish or slate colored. This may
  be considered as the type of one variety of decorations, readily
  distinguished by the unadorned circular spaces, the large scrolls, and
  the absence of animal forms. The larger forms of these vases are
  called by the Zunians _k[-a]h'-wi-n[-a]-k[ae]-t[-e]hl-le_; the smaller
  forms, _det-tsan-na_.

141. (39916). The ornamentation is well shown in Fig. 360. The
  combinations on this piece are rare on Zuni pottery, and the chief
  figure on the body is more symmetrical than is usual in this group of
  ware. This may also be considered as representing a second type of
  decorations of which there is but one other example in the collection.

142. (39920). This belongs to the variety represented by Fig. 360, and
  varies chiefly in having the neck decorated with leaf-like figures,
  and in having the scrolls replaced by triangles with inner serratures.

143. (39934). The largest size; Fig. 361. The decorations of this piece
  belong to a third variety, distinguished chiefly by the presence of
  the elk or deer. Attention is called to the three figured zones or
  belts on the body, the upper with the arch inclosing an elk; the
  middle and narrow belt adorned with figures of birds with a long crest
  feather. The helix or scroll is freely introduced in this variety. The
  one here figured is typical of quite a large group. The animals are
  usually black, as are the lines separating the spaces.

144. (41150). This is similar in size and decorations to Fig. 361, and
  is shown in Fig. 362. The difference in the form of the bird in this
  from that in the preceding is worthy of notice.

145. (39933). Similar to No. 143 (Fig. 361); bird scrolls as in No. 144.

146. (40322). Medium size, represented in Fig. 364. It may be grouped in
  the variety of which Fig. 359 is given as the type.

147. (39936). Large size; decorations resembling those in Fig. 364, but
  with two belts of scrolls on the body.

148. (41154). Medium size; figures as in No. 147.

149. (41155). 150. (41162). Medium size; decorations similar to the
  preceding, except that No. 150 (41162) has figures of sheep on the
  neck.

151. (41158). Large size; the ornamentation of this piece, as will be
  seen by reference to Fig. 363, belongs to the variety represented by
  Fig. 359 and 364, but differs in having on the body a middle zone of
  bird-like figures.

152. (41161). Large size; similar to Fig. 363.

153. (39943). Decorations very similar to those shown in Fig. 359.

154. (39937). Medium size; ornamentation similar to that seen in Fig.
  361.

155. (40312). Large size; shown in Fig. 365. As will be seen by
  comparison the decorations are the same as those in Fig. 361, except
  that the elk is omitted and a figure of scrolls introduced in its
  place.

156. (40310). Fig. 366. Large size. In the decorations of this piece we
  observe a new feature, a rosette or flower, showing a decided
  appreciation of the beautiful, either suggested by the flowers of the
  Helianthus or by something introduced by Europeans, but most probably
  the former. The different forms of this figure found on this ware
  furnish, perhaps the best evidence of taste exhibited by the Zunian
  artists.

157. (40313). Fig. 368. Large size. In this we see the same figures as
  in Figs. 363 and 366 brought into combination with the rosette, the
  birds being replaced by sheep.

158. (40318). Large size; similar to No. 149, except that the rosette is
  introduced in place of the circle.

159. (40314). }
160. (40316). }
  Decorations belong to the variety shown in Fig. 361.

161. (40317). Fig. 367. A little study of these figures will satisfy any
  one that although there is an apparently endless variety in details,
  there are, in fact, but comparatively few different figures.

162. (41146). Fig. 370. This belongs to the same variety as Fig. 368.

163. (40315). Large size, similar to that represented in Fig. 370, but
  varying in form, having the expansion at the shoulder more prominent
  and tapering more rapidly from thence to the base. The figures remind
  us of the trappings often seen in Japanese cuts.

164. (40319). Medium size; decorations similar to those in Fig. 361,
  except that here the elk or deer stands on a broad black band in which
  there is a row of white diamonds.

165. (40321). Medium size; of the variety represented in Fig. 361, but
  in these smaller pieces the bird zone is omitted, and there is but one
  figured zone on the body. In this example a small elk is represented
  as standing on the back of a larger one.

166. (40700). Medium size, belonging to the same type as the preceding.
  On the neck are figures of grotesque kite-shaped birds.

167. (40701). Medium size; Fig. 369. This and the preceding one are not
  designated as vases in the original Smithsonian Catalogue, nor in my
  field list, but according to the form should be classed in this group.

168. (41165). Medium size; decorations similar to those of Fig. 367, but
  varying in having the figure of a bird introduced in the middle belt
  with a small double scroll arising out of the back. The lower belt has
  the same bird reversed.

169. (39935). Medium size. The unusual decorations of this piece are
  shown in Fig. 371. It differs, as does also Fig. 369, from the usual
  form; the body is more nearly spherical, the neck more gracefully
  curved, and the rim slightly flaring. The proportions are also
  different; height, 8.75 inches; diameter of body, 10; of mouth, 6.5.

170. (41144). }
171. (41147). }
  Decorations similar to those in Fig. 364; (41144) varies in having the
  figures of elk or deer on the neck and in the coarser or ruder
  scrolls.

172. (41149). This somewhat abnormal form is well shown in Fig. 372. It
  is of medium size.

173. (41152). This belongs to the same type, both as to form and
  decorations.

174. (41153). Large size; of the usual form, but the decorations on the
  body peculiar, the design being crudely architectural.

175. (41156). Medium size, belonging to the type represented by Fig.
  361.

176. (41163). Medium size. This pretty vase has a somewhat peculiar
  decoration, which can be best described as a kind of patch-work
  representing small fragments of pottery.

177. (41166). Medium size, with the usual elk and scroll figures.

178. (41167). This specimen, which is rather above medium size, presents
  one of the most chaste designs in the entire group. It is represented
  in Fig. 374. Attention is called especially to the leaves and to the
  simple meander in the stripes.

179. (41168). Marked with the usual elk and scroll figures. Medium size.

180. (39774). The decorations of this piece, shown in Fig. 373, may be
  classed with the peculiar type with oblique and vertical bands
  represented in Fig. 374.

181. (39917). Figures similar to those in Fig. 363.

182. (40768). The decorations on this piece consist entirely of
  representations of pyramids or possibly of pueblos, and are arranged
  in bands, one on the neck and two on the body; the two upper bands
  show the figures inverted.

183. (40770). }
184. (40771). }
  No. 183 is decorated with scrolls and bird scrolls and a scalloped
  line around the shoulder; No. 184 with elks and scrolls on the body.

185-188. 185, (40800). Fig. 378. The grotesque or kite-like bird seen on
  the neck, though rarely seen on the large water vase, is common on the
  small ones. To this type belong the following Nos. 186, (40769); 187,
  (40772); 188, (40791).

189. (40773). }
190. (40776). }
  These have the usual triangular and scroll designs without animal
  figures, as in Fig. 364.

191. (40777). Fig. 377. The decorations on this evidently belong to the
  same type as those represented in Fig. 359, the bird on the neck being
  the only variation. To this type also belong the following numbers:
  192, (40778); 193, (40792); 194, (40794).

195. (40779). }
196. (40781). }
197. (40788). }
198. (40787). }
199. (40788). }
200. (40801). }
  These belong to the type represented by Fig. 361, distinguished
  chiefly by the elk, triangular figures, and scrolls.

201. (40780). }
202. (40784). }
203. (40786). }
204. (40790). }
  The decorations on these are similar to those shown in Figs. 366, 367,
  368, and 370, in which the rosette is a distinguishing characteristic.
  Nos. 201, 202, and 203 are without figures of animals; No. 204 has a
  double belt of elk figures between the rosettes.

205. (40782). The designs on this remain unfinished; except that the
  triangles on the neck and the arches in which it was evidently the
  intention to place the figures of animals, are shown.

206. (40785). Fig. 375. This pretty vase, as will be seen by reference
  to the figure, has the diameter greater in proportion to the height
  than usual. Although the design is tasteful the hues are coarse and
  not so well drawn as the figure indicates.

207. (40789). On this there is an evident attempt to represent a pueblo
  or communal dwelling and the ladders.

208. (40793). Shown in Fig. 376.

209. (40795). Neck and lower belt of the body marked with vertical lines
  and oblique diamonds; upper belt with inverted pyramidal figures.

210. (40849). Very small; marked with oblique scalloped lines.

211. (40850). Very small; elk and grotesque bird on the body.

212. (40851). Very small; decorations similar to those on the middle
  belt of Fig. 373.

  and unique.

The following specimens are red ware:

215. (40311). Large size; without ornamentation.

216. (40775). Small; form peculiar, diameter of the body greatest at the
  base, mouth flaring; decorations in black, consisting of triangles
  pointing downwards, and lines.

217. (40798). Medium size. See Fig. 381.

218. (40799). }
219. (40802). }
  Small; without ornamentation.

220. (41145). Large. See Fig. 383.

221. (41052). Medium size. See Fig. 384.

222. (41151). }
223. (41157). }
224. (41159). }
  Medium size; without ornamentation.

225. (41160). Medium size; with a scalloped band in black around the rim
  and shoulder.

Black ware:

226. (39930). Large size; without ornamentation.

The only black water vase obtained at Zuni; it was doubtless procured
from some other tribe. The black ware obtained from, this tribe is in
nearly all cases used for cooking, or holding liquids or moist foods. As
remarked in another place, the Zuni black ware is generally small except
in cases where large quantities of food are to be cooked, which occurs
at feast tunes, when very large vessels are employed.

_WATER JUGS AND JARS._

These vary so greatly in form that it is impossible to give any general
description that would convey a correct idea.

227. (39885). Somewhat mug-shaped, with handle; the top is rounded to
  the small mouth, no neck. White ware with scalloped bands and a
  Maltese cross.

228. (39886). Similar in form, but smaller, without handle or
  decorations.

229. (39899). Somewhat similar in form to the preceding, except that it
  is lower and more depressed, and instead of a mouth, at the top there
  is an orifice at the side as in the canteens, with which this should
  probably be classed.

230. (39940). Similar to No. 228.

231. (40062). Similar in form to No. 227, but without handle; with a
  double scalloped band around the constricted portion, and a single one
  around the mouth; figure of an insect on the upper half; apparently
  intended to represent a butterfly or large moth.

232. (40608). Small unhandled jug in the form of a smelling bottle.
  Unadorned.

233. (40611). Similar to No. 232.

234. (40697). }
235. (40608). }
  Like No. 228, with slight decorations.

236. (41140). An amphora or slender jug with two handles.

237. (39928). A jar shown in Fig. 399.

238. (39922). _M[-e]-h[-e]-t[-o]_, canteen of large size. Plain brown,
  as are also the following specimens:

239-242. 239, (40079); 240, (40081); 241, (40082), this has a small
  flower on one side; 242, (40083).

243-245. 243, (40088); 244, (40090); 245, (40091).

246-248. 246, (40085); 247, (40086), and 248, (40676), plain, white.

249. (40077). White with color decorations. Fig. 387.

The following eight specimens are also white with colors:

250. (40078). Decorated profusely with scrolls, leaves, and other
  figures. See Fig. 400.

251. (40080). Figure of a coiled snake or worm, without head or other
  character to indicate what it was intended to represent.

252. (40084). Usual scroll figures.

253. (40087). Decorated with simple loops and bands.

254. (40089). Radiating serrate lines.

255. (40092). Vase-shaped, with three colored bands.

256. (40093). Shown in Fig. 385.

257. (40886). Handsome piece, with floweret at the apex, scrolls on the
  side, and a scalloped band around the middle. The bands are always
  horizontal, the vessel being on its side. See Fig. 398.

258. (39914). _M[-e]-h[-e]-t[-o]-ts[-a]n-n[-a]_, canteens of small size.
  Red. Double, with two sets of handles and two chambers, but with
  only one orifice. Decorations in white, those on the larger piece
  consisting of meanders of the simplest form, a figure very unusual on
  Zuni pottery.

259. (39659). Brown, with handle and decorations in black. See Fig. 379.

260. (39923). Plain brown.

_PITCHERS._

These are of the usual form, of such vessels, except that they are
generally without the lip. It is possible that to a certain extent they
have been patterned after those observed in use among the Europeans or
white races with whom these Indians have come in contact. But we shall
presently find specimens similar in form among the ancient pottery found
in the ruins of the cliff houses. We are inclined to believe that the
form is original and not borrowed. The figures introduced will suffice
to illustrate the form and usual decorations. The specimens obtained are
generally small, varying in capacity from a pint to half a gallon. These
are known in Zuni by the name _[-E]'-m[-u]sch-t[-o]n-ne_.

290. (39918). Shown in Fig. 403.

291. (40668). With scalloped margin and decorations similar to those on
  Fig. 403.

292. (40669). Without handle and should be classed with the cups.
  Figures of plants.

293. (40671). Triangles on the upper portion; simple meander on the
  bowl.

294. (40672). Similar to the following.

320. (40840). Shown in Fig. 404.

_CUPS OR CUP-SHAPED VESSELS._

Under this general head are included two forms: one, closely resembling
the true cup, as shown in the figures and to which the Zunis apply the
name _s[-a]t-ts[-a]n-n[-a]-m[-u]-y[-a]_, and those in the form of ollas
or bowls, and without handles. The decorations of the true cup-shaped
vessels, especially on the inner surface, follow somewhat closely the
patterns found on the bowls. Here we see the zigzag marginal line, the
scalloped bands, the interlaced or tessellated bands with star points,
triangles, scrolls, &c.; but the elongate triangle or lance point is
seldom present. As no new figure is introduced it is unnecessary for me
to describe the decorations. A few are of red or brown ware.

The following numbers refer to true cups:

321-345. 321, (40058); 322, (40615); 323, (40616), Fig. 408; 324,
  (40617); 325, (40618); 326, (40619); 327, (40620); 328, (40621), Fig.
  409; 329, (40622); 330, (40623); 331, (40624); 332, (40625); 333,

  (40880)--this is an unusually large cup and although having a handle
  may have been used as a bowl; 344, (40998); 345, (41148), an unburnt
  specimen.

The following are without handles and are either small bowls or paint
cups:

346-355. 346, (40426); 347, (40436); 348, (40458); 349, (40642); 350,

_EATING BOWLS._

The smaller forms are called _s[-a]t-ts[-a]n-n[-a]_.

356. (39962). Fig. 410. The ornamentation is typical of a variety very
  common on Zuni bowls. The design on the outer surface is more constant
  than that on the inner, in which the figures of animals, especially
  the elk, are sometimes introduced. The distinguishing feature of this
  type is the zigzag line on the inner margin.

The following numbers belong to the same type:

357-378. 357, (39746); 358, (39973); 359, (39975); 360, (39981); 361,

403-417. 403, (39960); 404, (40002); 405, (40006); 406, (40232); 407,
  (40233); 408, (40237); 409, (40263); 410, (40268); 411, (40284), in
  this small specimen there are but few figures; 412, (40503); 413,

  readily distinguished by the broad checkered band on the inner margin.

There are two sub-varieties, one with and one without figures on the
external surface. This and the following specimens belong to the latter
group:

  inner margin forms the distinguishing characteristic. The following
  are similarly decorated:

585, 586. 585, (40010); 586, (40167).

587. (40033). As closely resembling the preceding, I introduce here a
  variety with a latticed marginal band shown in Fig. 414.

The following specimens belong to the same variety, the chief
differences, being the inner central figures:

588. (40164). Fig. 415.

589. (40177). Do.

590. (40181). This specimen has no ornamentation except the band.

591. (40296). Fig. 416. This varies in having the figures of birds with

  These are but partially shown in the figure.

592, 593. 592, (40965) and 593 (40955) belong to the same variety, but
  their inner decorations resemble more closely those represented in
  Fig. 415.

594. (40493). Fig. 417. The decorations on this piece belong to the very
  common variety shown in Figs. 356, 411, and 412.

595-600. To this type belong the following numbers: 595, (40008); 596,
  (40009); 597, (40012); 598, (40013); 599, (40020); 600, (40021), this
  varies in having no ornamentation on the outer surface.

  (40931), shown in Fig. 420. I would call attention here to the strong
  similarity of the inner decorations of this bowl with those on the
  body of the vase represented in Fig. 359. This is properly a bread
  bowl.

639-646. 639, (40938); 640, (40957); 641, (40958); 642, (40967); 643,

_COOKING VESSELS._

These vessels are generally of medium size, though in some instances the
dimensions vary exceedingly. Those used in cooking for feasts are quite
large, sometimes with a capacity of about ten gallons; the smallest,
designed only for family use, are less than four inches in diameter and
not quite three inches high. They are of two general forms, one similar
to the ordinary pots used on cooking stoves, the other bowl-shaped. Two
specimens in the collection are provided with legs; to these the Zunians
apply the name _s[ae]-m[-u] y[)e]n-s[ae]-qui-p[ae]_. See Fig. 432. As a
general rule, the rims of these vessels are flared, and on some of them,
close to the rim on the outside, are ear-like projections, which are
probably intended as catches by which, with pokers or sticks, they can
be removed from or arranged in position on the fire. They are never
ornamented, and have no coloring other than that which is acquired in
baking. These vessels are used in cooking such foods as contain liquids.
Three names are applied to cooking pots, having reference to size,
viz.: _p[ae]h-t[-e]h-le_ is the large cylindrical pot; the smaller
pot of the same form is _p[ae]h-t[-e]hl-ts[-a]n-n[-a]_; and
_w[-a]h-li-[ae]h-k[ae]-t[-e]hl-le_ is the common cooking pot. The
Olla or bowl-shaped pot, Fig. 433, is called _s[ae]-m[-u]-y[-e]n_.

The following numbers belong to the _p[ae]h-t[-e]hl-ts[-a]n-n[-a]_ group
and present no variations worthy of special notice.

742, 743. 742, (41113). Fig. 436; 743, (41114), Fig. 433. These
illustrations represent a form and have the appearance of the so-called
ancient ware; the latter specimen bears the impress of the grass which
was produced in the baking process.

744. (40865). Fig. 435. Cooking pot.

The following numbers represent specimens of cooking pots of varying
sizes, though generally small and of the form of No. 744, though some
few present the appearance of bowls:

745-766. 745, (41115); 746, (41116); 747, (41117); 748, (41118); 749,

  (41138); 765, (41140); 766, (41141).

The following belong to the _s[ae]-m[-u]-y[)e]n_ bowls:

767-804. 767, (41055); 768, (41056); 769, (41057); 770, (41058); 771,

  (41133); 825, (41139); 826, (41143). This is an unburnt specimen of
  unusual form, resembling in this respect a sugar bowl, its margin and
  sides undulated.

827, 828. 827, (40853), bowl-shaped with conical bottom; 828, (41053),
Fig. 432, pot-shaped, but with four legs.

829, 830. 829, (41134); 830, (41135), are really pitchers, as will be
seen by reference to Fig. 431, which represents the latter, but they
appear to be made for cooking purposes, as they are designated by the
name _s[ae]-m[-u]-y[)e]n_.

_LADLES._

Called by the Zunians _sa-sho-k[)o]n-ne_. These are of two forms, one
resembling somewhat an oyster-shell, the other with a handle resembling
a spoon. The forms and decorations are shown in the figures. They are of
white ware usually with figures on the inner surface, and of red ware
without ornamentation. They vary in size from eight inches in length and
five inches across the bowl to four and a half and two and a half
inches.

_BASKETS._

Called by the Zunians, _[-a]h-w[-e]hl-wi-[-a]h-p[ae]-s[-a]hl_. These
vessels, which vary in size from four to eight inches in diameter and
from two to five in depth, are in the form of bowls, sometimes with a
handle over the top like a basket handle, sometimes without. The margin
is either scalloped, as in Fig. 452, or terraced so as to resemble the
section of a pyramid or pueblo, being cut in this form with a horse-hair
while soft. They are always of white ware decorated with black. The
margin is uniformly black, and there is often an inner and outer
submarginal narrow band following the undulations or terraces. The
figures most common, and in fact almost exclusively used, are those
resembling tadpoles, but which, as I learned, are intended to represent
a small crustacean or the larva of an insect common in the water-pools
and streams of the Zuni country; and the somewhat grotesque figures of
the horned toad (_Phrynosoma_). These figures are placed both on the
outer and inner surfaces, though the figure of the reptile is generally
found on the outer.

These singular vessels are used by the Indians only in their sacred and
ceremonial dances. In them is placed a small quantity of meal; they are
then borne in the hands of the women, who, during the dance, take a
small quantity of the meal, just as much as they can hold between the
tips of the fingers, and sprinkle it on the sacred objects and on the
heads of the persons leading in the ceremonies.

As the forms and decorations are correctly shown in the figures, I shall
only notice those which are unusual.

Without handles; margin scalloped:

871-873. 871, (40074); 872, (40075), Fig. 443; 873, (40400), Fig. 444.

Without handles; margin terraced:

874. (40337). Figures of insects on outer surface.

875-881. 875, (40344); 876, (40364); 877, (40367); 878, (40368); 879,
  (40369); 880, (40370); 881, (40371), Fig. 445.

882-899. 882, (40372), Fig. 447; 883, (40373); 884, (40374); 885,
  (40375); 886, (40376); 887, (40377), Fig. 446; 888, (40378); 889,
  (40380); 890, (40381); 891, (40382); 892, (40383); 893, (40384); 894,
  (40385); 895, (40392); 896, (40393); 897, (40394); 898, (40396); 899,
  (40803), this specimen, which is but slightly burnt, is more globular
  in form than usual, and has mounted on each pyramid a small image,
  one human, one of a dog or fox, one of a chicken, and the other
  probably intended for a bird. This is really not a meal basket,
  but is carried in the dance for rain, and bears the name
  _tkh[ae]-p[-o]-k[-a]-t[-e]hl-le_.

900-902. 900, (41014); 901, (41015), this has in the place of the
  reptile the figure of a bird; 902, (41018).

903. (39971). Fig. 442. A Zuni clay basket without handles; the form of
  the margin and inner decorations are unusual, and on this account and
  the fact that the little water animal does not appear on it, it is
  probably from some other tribe, though obtained at Zuni.

904. (40354). Fig. 452. With handles; margin scalloped. The decorations
  on this basket are unusual. The chief figure and the most interesting
  one on this entire group of pottery is that of a snake encircling the
  body of the basket; on the head of which is a feather crest.

905. (41019). Fig. 449. A Zuni dance basket, one of the most complete in
  form and decoration in the collection.

906-909. 906, (40356), Fig. 450; 907, (40390); 908, (40391); 909,
  (40806). This is more cup shaped than usual, and is ornamented
  with the geometrical figures common on bowls. It belongs to
  a distinct class of sacred vessels to which the name
  _tkh[ae]-p[-o]-k[-a]-t[-e]hl-le_ is applied.

910-913. 910, (40336); 911, (40353); 912, (40355), Fig. 451; 913,
  (40357), varies in having the head of a bird. With handles; margins
  terraced.

914-922. 914, (40358); 915, (40360); 916, (40361); 917, (40362);
  918, (40365); 919, (40366); 920, (40359), Fig. 448; 921, (40379),
  Fig. 453; 922, (40386). This and the three following specimens
  are small baskets called by the Zunians
  _[-a]h'-w[-e]hl-wi-[-a]h-p[ae]-s[-a]hl-ts[-a]n-n[-a]_.

923-928. 923, (40387); 924, (40388); 925, (40389); 926, (40395). This
  and the two following bear the same figures as observed on Fig. 452.
  927, (40397); 928, (40398).

929. (40399). This basket is ornamented with the conventional little
  water animal, inside and out; it also presents the head and tail of a
  snake, the body of which encircles the base of the basket. The head of
  the snake is decorated with a crest and a horn-like projection
  immediately before the eyes. The tongue and teeth are also represented
  in colors on the specimen. The rim is serrated and painted black with
  a small line conforming to the black band immediately under it.

930. (41016). Is without a handle, but noticeable for the representation
  of a bird, on each side of which are two of the little water animals.

931. (41017). Basket without handle and four pyramids with serrated
  edges, and representation of horned toad on sides.

932. (41019). Basket with handle, large toad on each side, and a
  dragonfly on each side of the toad.

_PAINT CUPS._

These are always small, but vary in size from one and a half to three
inches in height. They are usually in the form of water vases or
globular jars, though sometimes of a true cup shape, and occasionally
cubical. They are generally single, but quite often double, and
occasionally triple and quadruple. To the large-sized single ones the
Zunians apply the name of _h[)e]l-i-p[-o]-k[-a]-t[-e]hl-le_; and to
those of smaller sizes, _h[)e]l-i-p[-o]-k[-a]-t[-e]hl-ts[-a]n-n[-a]_.
They are usually without handles, but sometimes these are present. The
double ones are connected only by a bar extending from the body of one
to that of the other; and the triple and quadruple ones in a similar
manner. They are of red and white ware like the other pottery; the
decorations on the white are similar to those already described, so far
as they can be adapted to these small articles.

We shall give the numbers without remarks, except to note unusual forms
and figures.

Single cups:

933-938. 933, (39881); 934, (39888); 935, (39938); 936, (39939); 937,

  without bar.

Triple cups:

1018-1023. 1018, (40605); 1019, (40606); 1020, (40609); 1021, (40680);
  1022, (40693); 1023, (40856).

Quadruple cups, to which is applied the same Zuni name as that given to
those provided with triple and quadruple cups.

1024, 1025. 1024, (40612), Fig. 457; 1025, (40613). Brown, square,
united directly at the sides without bars.

1026-1029. 1026, (40652); 1027, (40855); 1028, (40856), square; 1029,
  (40859), square.

_CONDIMENT CUPS._

These are similar in form and decorations to the paint cups, and are
also round and square, single, double, and quadruple. They are usually
small, holding from less than half a pint to a pint. The different names
applied to them will be given as they are reached in the list. The
double and quadruple ones are connected together in the same manner as
the multiple paint-pots,

Single cups:

1030. (39878). Square with figures of chickens on the sides.

_M[-a]-p[-o]-k[-a]-t[-e]hl-le_ is the name by which the round or
vase-shaped vessels are designated. They are numbered as follows:

1031. (39905). Fig. 459. The figures on this specimen appear to be
  intended as representations of some neuropterous insect, but possibly
  they represent birds.

1032-1037. 1032, (40653); 1033, (40654); 1034, (40655); 1035, (40656);
  1036, (40657); 1037, (40658). Some of these appear, from the fragments
  of bars attached to them, to have belonged to double specimens.

1038, 1039. 1038, (40633); 1039, (40832). These two are red ware.

1040-1049. 1040, (40833); 1041, (40834); 1042, (40835); 1043, (41006);
  1044, (41007); 1045, (41008), Fig. 458; 1046, (41170); 1047, (40603);
  1048, (40606); and 1049, (40664), are square.

Double cups:

The round form has the same name as the single salt cup, but the square
pattern is named _M[-a]'-p[-o]-k[-a]-thl[-e]-l[-o]-ne_. The following
specimens belong to the latter class:

1050-1057. 1050, (39900); 1051, (39901); 1052, (40416); 1053, (40604);
  1054, (40662); brown 1055, (40683); 1056, (40831); 1057, (40661).

1058-1068. The following are round: 1058, (40410); 1059, (40411); 1060,
  (40412); 1061, (40413); 1062, (40414); 1063, (40415); 1064, (40440);
  1065, (40659); 1066, (40660); 1067, (40666); 1068, (40667).

1069. (40836). Quadruple. This and the last three preceding specimens
  are ornamented like Fig. 458.

_EFFIGIES._

These figures, which are of small size, the largest not exceeding one
foot in length, are quite rude, rendering it difficult in some cases to
tell what animal is intended, the only exceptions to this rule being
some figures of owls, in which the Zunians appear to have made the
nearest approach to the true form. They are generally of white ware,
decorated with colors. Often these decorations are arbitrary, but as a
general rule there has been an evident attempt to imitate nature so far
as it could be done with the various shades of brown and black.

Some of the larger pieces, especially the owls, have an opening at the
top or on the back, as though designed for water vessels.

The objects most commonly represented are owls (which largely
predominate), antelope, elk, ducks, and chickens. The human form, the
pig, sheep, horse, &c., are occasionally represented.

Owls, _m[-u]-h[-u]-que_ and _m[-u]-h[-u]-que-ts[-a]n-n[-a]_. These are
nearly always represented with feet, and in most cases with legs. The
body is usually disproportionately large, as are also the legs; the bill
is small, and the wings are represented by small lateral projections;
the tail is short. The eyes are generally well represented. The
feathers, as will be seen, by reference to the figures, are quite well
shown. The figures nave an opening on the top of the head.

As there is a strong similarity in form, and the mode of decorating them
is shown in the figures, no special remarks on the different specimens
are necessary.

1070-1077. 1070, (39875); 1071, (39876); 1072, (39877); 1073, (39921);
  1074, (39942); 1075, (39957); 1076, (40054); 1077, (40059), shown in
  Fig. 460; this is one of the very few without feet.

1078-1096. 1078, (40064); 1079, (40065); 1080, (40068); 1081, (40138);
  1082, (40140), Fig. 461; 1083, (40261); 1084, (40142), small; 1085,
  (40262); 1086, (40141); 1087, (40142); 1088, (40409); 1089, (40734);
  1090, (40735), without feet; 1091, (40736); 1092, (40737); 1093,
  (40738), Fig. 463, very large; 1094, (40740), Fig. 462; 1095, (40741);
  1096, (40742).

1097-1112. 1097, (40743), Fig. 466; 1098, (40744); 1099, (40745); 1100,
  (40746), without feet; 1101, (40747); 1102, (40748), Fig. 468; 1103,
  (40749); 1104, (40750); 1105, (40751); 1106, (40752); 1107, (40753);
  1108, (40754), Fig. 467; 1109, (40755); 1110, (40756); 1111, (40757);
  1112, (40758), without decorations.

1113-1120. 1113, (40759); 1114, (40760); 1115, (40761); 1116, (40762);
  1117, (40763); 1118, (40764); 1119, (40765); 1120, (40766), bearing a
  single young owl on its back.

1121. (40767). Shown in Fig. 469, bearing three young owls on its back.

1122. (41043).

1123, 1124. 1123, (40066), Fig. 465, and 1124, (40739), Fig. 464. Two
owl-shaped water vessels from Zuni.

Duck-shaped canteens, _[-e]-y[-a]h-m[-e]-h[-e]-to_, are usually
represented in a swimming posture, without feet, though occasionally
the standing posture is adopted. The feather decorations are not so
generally used as on the owls; several specimens bear on the back
or sides the figure of the grotesque bird with spread wings. These
specimens, like the owl images, have an orifice on the top of the head
as though intended for water vessels, but are seldom used as such at
the present time.

1125. (39910). Shown in Fig. 471.

The following are similar:

1126, 1127. 1126, (39879); 1127, (39889).

1128. (36911). With feet, in standing posture.

1129. (40063). With wings, without feet.

1130. (41023). This and the three following specimens have feather
  decorations and are small. _[-E]-y[-a]h-m[-e]-h[-e]-t[-o]-ts[-a]n-n[-a]_
  of the Zunians.

1131-1133. 1131, (41024); 1132, (41025); 1133, (41027).

1134. (41026), Fig. 470. Chickens. The cock, _t[-o]-k[-o]k-ke_; the hen,
  _t[-o]-k[-o]k-k[-a]_. The general term applied to the young, without
  reference to sex, is _s[ae]-pi-pe_.

1135. (39919). Represented in Fig. 472.

1136, 1137. 1136, (41028); 1137, (41029).

  (41216), this piece represents a hen with three young chickens on her
  back, as in Fig. 473.

1152-1155. 1152, (39897); 1153, (41044); 1154, (41045); 1155, (41046),
  Fig. 477. Antelope. (_m[-a]h-[-a]-wi._) The form and decorations are
  shown in Figs. 477 and 478.

1156-1161. 1156, (41047); 1157, (41048); 1158, (41050), Fig. 478; 1159,

  1166, (41217). Pigs, _pits-[-o]-te_. The figures show the forms and
  decorations with sufficient accuracy to make further description
  unnecessary.

1167. (41218). Ox, _w[-e]-[ae]-si_. But a single example in the
  collection. Shown in Fig. 479.

_CLAYS AND PIGMENTS._

The following specimens are employed in the manufacture of pottery and
for decorative purposes:

1204, 1205. 1204, (41230) and 1205, (41231). Are specimens of a whitish
clay or kaolin, of which a solution is made and applied to the outer
surfaces of earthenware. This whiting in a coarser state is used for
white-washing their chimneys and rooms.

1206. (41265). Is a dark carbonaceous clay which the Zuni Indians obtain
  from near the summit of a mesa on which stand the ruins of their
  ancient village--or, at least, where they claim to have resided during
  the Spanish invasion of their country. As this clay is one of the
  principal elements in the manufacture of Zuni pottery, a quantity of
  it was procured and numbered as one of the specimens of the
  collection.

1207. (41901). Small nodules of azurite used by the Indians in
  decorating their altars, &c.

1208. (41902). White clay or kaolin, same as Nos. 1204 and 1205.

1209. (41903). Finer quality of white clay.

1210, 1211. 1210, (41904) and 1211, (41905). Are specimens of the above
of a coarser quality.

1212. (41906). Tierra amarilla, or yellow micaceous clay, of which the
  Rio Grande Indians make many varieties of vessels.

1213. (42342). A yellowish sandy clay, which is used as one of the
  coloring pigments in decorating pottery. This clay burns to a reddish
  hue and gives to the pottery those lines of a brick-red color.

1214. (42343). Very dark colored ore, resembling magnetic iron ore; this
  stone is reduced in a small mortar, and a paint made of it for
  decorating their ware black, which result is obtained by baking.

  (40479); and 1257, (40480) are a variety of examples of the corn
  basket or _hu-chi-p[)o]n-ne_.

1258. (40881). Toy basket of Navajo manufacture, of closely-woven

_PADS._

The following are ring-shaped pads made of yucca leaves interwoven in
such a manner as to leave the centre open sufficiently to fit the top of
the head. These pads are used in carrying water, by placing the pad on
the head into which the base of the vase fits. They are used also to
hold water jars and vases on the ground, thus protecting the bottom of
the vessels from wearing away. They are called in Zuni _h[-a]-kin-ne_.

  1292, (40926).

_DOMESTIC IMPLEMENTS, TOYS, &c._

In the collection are a number of wooden spoons or ladles of various,
sizes. These utensils were not frequently met with. The readiness with
which the Indians can make pottery or earthern ladles, a large number of
which are in the collection, has caused these to supersede the former.
The wooden spoons are always chiseled from a single piece of wood. See
Fig. 490.

  1297, (41022) are specimens of spoons and ladles of wood. The large
  ones are called _t[ae]m-sh[)o]-k[)o]n-n[-a]-ts[-a]n_, the smaller,
  _t[ae]m-sh[)o]-k[)o]n ts[-a]n n[-a]_.

1298. (41276). A wooden chair, made entirely of wood and in imitation,
  of a common chair, ornamented with carvings.

  blankets woven in this manner are water-tight. This comb is called
  _o-h[-a]-n[-a]-p[-a]-ne_.

  _t[-a]-s[-a]-quin-ne_. This is the only specimen of the kind in the
  collection. The foot is used in digging as we use a spade. In making
  holes in the ground for planting grain, one foot is placed on the
  short projection, and the individual using it walks along, each
  alternate step making a hole in the ground into which to drop the
  grain. See Fig. 496.

  attached to a stick in such a manner that the wings can be made to
  move up and down by pulling a string, in imitation of the bird in
  flight.

1335. (41184). Toy or baby cradle, called _wi-h[-a]-klem-ts[-a]n-n[-a]_,
  (see Fig. 489), with a wooden doll arranged to show the manner of

  are specimens of a rattle or musical instrument made from the shell of
  a turtle which is highly esteemed by the Pueblo tribes. The flesh of
  the turtle is carefully removed from the shell, leaving it hollow. To
  the edges of the breast plate are attached the toes of goats or sheep.
  These toes coming in contact with the hollow shell produce a peculiar
  sound, in keeping with the sound caused by the gourd rattles used in
  the same ceremony. The rattle is fastened to the rear of the right leg
  near the knee when employed in the dances.

  Figs. 504-508.--Wolpi Axes and Metate.]

1412. (42206). Grooved axe of black fine-grained sandstone, about eight
  inches long; water-worn to its present shape, afterward grooved to
  render it suitable for use.

1413. (42207). Fig. 504. Grooved axe, of basalt. The only specimen of
  this particular form in the collection.

1414. (42208). Fig. 505. Large stone celt of coarse sandstone, light
  gray color. It is shaped more like a wedge than the cut indicates. It
  is difficult to conjecture what this implement could have been used
  for. The sandstone of which it is made is too soft for either
  splitting or hammering. As it is about ten inches long and has four
  flat sides it may have been a grinder, as many of those implements are
  not unlike it in length and appearance. Its surface is quite rough and
  pitted.

1415. (42209). Sandstone maul, grooved, surface rough.

1416. (42210). Triangular-shaped maul, grooved in the middle; of coarse
  basalt. This and similar mauls evidently at one time had handles fixed
  to them, but at the present day it is not uncommon to see the modern
  Pueblo Indians holding them in the hand to crush their grain, chili or
  red-pepper pods in round mortars.

1417. (42211). Grooved axe of basalt.

1418. (42212). Small grooved axe of metamorphic rock.

1419. (42213). Fig. 507. Water-worn boulder of quartzite, grooved around
  the centre.

1420. (42214). Basaltic maul, grooved in the middle like the preceding.
  Used by the Indians at the present day for pounding chili or red
  pepper.

1421. (42216). Grooved axe of greenstone, quite long, well shaped, and
  nicely polished.

1422. (42217). Grooved axe of greenstone, similar to the preceding.

1423. (42218). Grooved axe of sandstone; top square.

1424. (42219). Axe of basalt, grooved on three sides.

1425. (42220). Grooved axe of greenstone.

1426. (42221). Grooved axe of quartz.

1427. (42222). Grooved axe of sandstone. Groove very near the top.

1428. (42223). Grooved axe of greenstone, well polished.

1429. (42224). Grooved axe of schistose rock, much flattened, with a
  small second groove below the larger one. 1430. (42225). Small grooved
  axe of greenstone, body rather square, top quite small, with the
  groove very near it.

1431. (42226). Axe of basalt, grooved on three sides near its top, which
  is flat.

1432. (42227). Grooved on three sides.

1433. (42228). Grooved axe.

1434. (42319). Grooved axe made from a fragment of a grinder.

1435. (42320). Same as preceding.

1436. (42321). Rough chipping or stone hammer.

1437. (42322). Large grooved maul of a ferruginous substance.

1438. (42323). Large egg-shaped grooved maul of coarse sandstone.

1439. (42326). Large grooved maul of irregular shape and surface;
  finegrained sandstone.

1440-1447. 1440, (42327); 1441, (42328); 1442, (42329); 1443, (42330);
  1444, (42331); 1445, (42332); 1446, (42333); 1447, (42334), are all
  quite similar to the two preceding mauls, and are all of sandstone.

1448. (42335). A very large grooved maul, almost square, and weighing
  about fifteen pounds.

1449. (42336). Grooved maul of very coarse-grained sandstone; short and
  thick.

1450. (42337). Fig. 506. Grooved maul of compact sandstone. The body of
  the maul is almost round, though the cut makes it appear flat. Several
  such specimens were collected, and in all instances they show that
  they have been better preserved than the axes. This is probably due to
  the fact that their shape adapts them to grinding foods and grain, and
  hence they are not used for splitting or cutting.

1451. (42339). Rough stone maul of sandstone, grooved in the middle.

1452. (42350). Small grooved axe of sandstone from the ruins of Pecos.

1453. (42246). Celt of a very black slate stone.

1454. (42247). Celt. This is a very fine specimen, of yellow polished
  slate of about the same texture as the preceding one. It is about
  twelve inches long, and tapers gradually from the broad edge to the
  top.

_METATES, OR GRAIN-GRINDERS, AND PESTLES._

1455-1460. 1455, (42279); 1456, (42287); 1457, (42289); 1458, (42309);
  1459, (42310); 1460, (42311), are ordinary specimens of the metate
  placed together in the shape of a mill. See Fig. 508.

1461, 1462. 1461, (42313), and 1462, (42314), are rubbing stones.

1463. (42338). Broken metate rubber.

1464. (42249). Rubbing stone.

1466. (42274). Small quartz rubber.

1467. (42275). Small greenstone rubber.

1468-1473. 1468, (42276); 1469, (42277); 1470, (42278); 1471, (42316);
  1472, (42317); 1473, (42318), are all fragrants of rubbers.

1474. (42290). Bound sandstone pestle, each end ovate.

1475. (42294). Square sandstone pestle.

1476. (42295). Small round pestle, with rounded ends.

_MORTARS, PESTLES, ETC._

Nearly all the pestles and mortars from Wolpi present evidences of age.
They are nearly all of coarse sandstone, and were used for bruising food
and grain. They are usually quite large, heavy, and round. As they are
generally of soft yielding rocks, the cavities are worn very deep in
most of them.

1477. (42281). Large flat food mortar.

1478. (42282). Paint mortar, made from a round sandstone boulder about
  five inches in diameter.

1479. (42283). Grain mortar.

1480. (42284). Mortar made from a round somewhat flattened sandstone
  boulder.

1481. (42285). Food mortar of indurated sandstone, about four inches
  thick and eight inches in diameter, irregularly round, the depression
  being about three inches deep.

1482. (42286). Mortar for crushing grain; this is an unusually fine
  specimen. It is about seven inches high, and an almost round body,
  about an inch and a half thick at the top of the rim; the cavity is
  quite a perfect oval in shape, about five inches deep; bottom flat.

1483. (42288). Mortar similar to the above, but having a projection on
  one side like the ear of a kettle.

1484. (42291). Mortar and pestle. The mortar is nearly square; cavity
  about five inches deep and seven in diameter. The pestle has a groove
  round the middle.

1485. (42292). Paint mortar about one inch thick and nearly square.

1486. (42293). Round quartzitic boulder; one side flat, the other with a
  small cavity.

1487. (42307). Bowl-shaped food mortar, about ten inches in diameter and
  five inches high.

1488. (42270). Stone knife with two notches or grooves near the large
  end.

1489. (42271). Forty specimens of arrow-heads and small perforators,
  flint and agate; most of them very well shaped.

1490. (42253). Sandstone gaming ball, painted.

1491-1493. 1491, (42254); 1492, (42255); and 1493, (42256), are all
  sandstone gaming balls.

1494. (42257). Fig. 509. Hollow tube. The figure represents one made
  from potters' clay, the other is of siliceous material. These pipes
  are not in use at the present time, but are frequently found around
  the ruins and in possession of the Indians.

1495. (42261). Stone image, probably intended to represent a rabbit. It
  is of fine-grained stone. Shown in Fig. 513. There are quite a number
  of these little images from Wolpi and Zuni; as they appear to
  represent rabbits, it is presumed that they are quite old, and
  possibly antedate the introduction of domestic animals among the
  tribes.

1496. (42296). Small paint muller of jasper.

1497. (42297). Square quartzitic paint muller.

1498. (42298). Triangular paint rubber of quartz.

1499-1503. 1499, (42299), quartz; 1500, (42300); 1501, (42301); 1502,
  (42303); and 1503, (42304), are all quartz paint pestles made from
  half sections of small semi spherical boulders; the large end, which
  is flat, being used for the grinding part.

1504. (42305). Part of a grooved axe.

1505. (42306). Rubbing stone with four rubbing surfaces.

1506. (42262). Fig. 512. This undoubtedly represents some animal.

1507. (42263). Fig. 510. This evidently represents some animal other
  than the rabbit. The body is long and slender, and is provided with a
  tail.

1508. (42264). Small sandstone image, which is a good representation of
  a bear; grooved around the neck, with mouth and eyes and short tail.
  None of these little images are provided with anything more than short
  stubs for limbs.

1509. (42265). Very small sandstone image, quite similar to No. 1507.

1510. (40114). Wolpi neck ornament, Fig. 511, _hu-wat-he-qua-ve_, of red
  slate stone notched at each end, as shown in the cut, and perforated
  at the upper edge to receive a cord, with which it is suspended to the
  neck. Though a rare ornament, it possesses no particular known
  significance.


ARTICLES OF CLAY.

_WATER VASES._

These are of the usual form, and for the most part of the usual size
found at Zuni; but there are also a number of very large specimens of
the white ornamented, black, and red ware, having a capacity of ten or
twelve gallons.

White decorated ware:

1511. (41356). Decorations exactly the same type as that shown in Fig.
  359, except that there is a regular meander around the shoulder. The
  type is shown in Fig. 514.

The following belong to the same type as the above, the variations being
but slight, the large circular space with scroll being the chief
characteristic:

1512. (41601). Figure on the neck as on the body of Fig. 372.

1513. (41602). Shown in Fig. 514.

1514. (41603). The block containing the smaller circle is here solid and
  square; there is a zig-zag band around the neck as on the margins of
  some Zuni bowls.

1515. (41604). This varies in having in place of the block with the
  small circle, a regularly checkered block.

1516. (41606). This has only the large diamond figures on the body, and
  a band of s's round the shoulder.

1517. (41607). Like No. 1514.

1518. (41454). With handles on sides; fringe-like band around the
  shoulder.

1519. (41455). Simple linear band around the body.

1520. (41456). Figures of a trident or three-pronged fork; and ladle on
  the body.

The following are plain brown and red ware, some of them very large. The
neck is but slight, and they are often more pot-shaped than olla form.
Without ornamentation.

Brown or red.

1521-1533. 1521, (41632); 1522, (41633); 1523, (41635); 1524, (41636);

  (41641); 1530, (41642); 1531, (41643); 1532, (41649); 1533, (41650).

1534. (41644).

1535. (40646). Fig. 515.

1536. (41647).

1537. (41648).

1538. (42374). Very large pot, used for cooking. Name, _nu-a-mash-pe_.
  Represented in Fig. 516.

_WATER JUGS AND JARS._

These are similar to those obtained at Zuni; sub-globular in form, one
side more distinctly flattened on which to lie, the other very convex.
Usually with two handles, sometimes loops, and sometimes studs or knobs.
Occasionally ornamented white ware, but most generally unadorned brown
or red ware. The latter showing, on some pieces, at least, a slight,
perhaps accidental, glazing. They vary in size from six or seven gallons
down to less than a pint.

As the various figures used in decorations have been described, only
those which are unusual will be noticed here.

White decorated ware:

1539. (41320). Underside as usual, blown. Scalloped band in direction of
  mouth and handle, transverse double scalloped band across the upper
  half.

1540. (41362). Similar to the last.

1541. (41342). Simple bands and scrolls.

1542, 1543. 1542, (41401) and 1543, (41447). Similar.

Brown ware without ornamentation:

1544-1567. 1544, (41321); 1545, (41322); 1546, (41323); 1547, (41324);

1568-1569. 1568, (41609) and 1569, (41611). These have only the large
  diamond figures on the body, and a zig-zag line around the neck.

1570. (41610). The large diamonds serrate on the outer margin; neck with
  doubly oblique serrate lines.

1571. (41613). As in Fig. 514, except that the neck, instead of the
  zigzag, has oblique diamonds.

1572. (41614). This varies from the preceding in having only a narrow
  scalloped band around the neck.

1573. (41620). Only the large scrolls, nothing on the neck.

1574. (41622). Similar to the preceding, except that each alternate
  scroll is replaced by a rosette in a circle.

1575. (41615). Like No. 1515, except that the neck has a scalloped band
  with birds' heads.

1576. (41618). Large diamonds on the body alternately with rosettes, by
  the side of which is a bird.

1577. (41621). Similar to Fig. 514, except that the black has no circle
  in it.

1578. (41358). Small with a broad checkered band around the body.

1579. (41605). With narrow scalloped band around the neck; triangular
  figures pointing to right and left on the body with cross lines
  between the bases.

1580. (41608). Outline figures of terraced hills with cactus growing
  from them, and curved scalloped lines above.

1581. (41612). Scalloped band around the neck; oblique, heavy, double
  diamond figures with scrolls on the body.

1583. (41616). Line of little circles on the neck; triangles of lines,
  pointing to the left on the body.

1584. (41619). Similar in form and decorations to Fig. 371 (Zuni),
  except that the upper side of the band is formed of triangles instead
  of scrolls.

1585. (41629). This is really a double-handled jar.

1586. (41630). Scalloped band around bottom, serrated squares near rim.

  (41354); 1602, (41355); 1603, (41448).

Small toy canteens:

1604-1607. 1604, (41439); 1605, (41440); 1606, (41442); 1607, (41443).

The following three are cup-shaped, with an ear on each side to which to
attach a string, the top is closed, with a round orifice in the middle,
and they are either medicine or little paint vessels and not canteens,
as given in the original field catalogue:

1608-1610. 1608, (41444); 1609, (41445); 1610, (41446).

Water jugs and bottles are of various forms, which will be described
under their respective numbers. They are usually of the white decorated
ware. The brown ware is always undecorated.

1615. (41366). Fig. 519. A water jar made in imitation of a common gourd
  cultivated by many of the Pueblo tribes. The body is ornamented on
  both sides with a curved line and birds, as seen in the figure. A
  small circular orifice is left at the base of the handle.

1616. (41367). As in Fig. 520.

very large extent supplies with this people the place of the cup.

1631. (41409). Regular handled cup; white ware, with a broad band in
  which are white crescents.

1632. (41461). Shaped as preceding. White ware, all except a marginal

  1641, (41429). These five are brown ware.

1642. (41435). A pretty pitcher-shaped vessel ornamented with interlaced
  or cross lines forming a regular net-work.

_EATING-BOWLS._

The bowls vary in size, as do those from Zuni, but as a general rule
they are small, or of but medium size; quite a number of those obtained
are very small. In form they are generally like those from Zuni, but
some are biscuit-shaped, as those from Tesuke; others are true basins;
and a few are square, and perhaps should not be classed as bowls, though
we have included them under that general term. The decorations on the
larger ones of regular form are very similar to those seen on Zuni
bowls. The colors black and red or brown are usually lighter and
brighter than on the Zuni pottery:

1643. (41357). Regular Form. Decorations on the inner face only;
  marginal zigzag line, with diamond and scroll below.

1644. (41359). Outer and inner surface decorations as in Fig. 412.

_COOKING VESSELS._

These are usually unadorned and of brown or black ware. The number
obtained was not large, and they vary greatly in character. They are
generally of medium size or small, and some which appear to be used as
cooking vessels have a handle on the side and resemble pitchers and
cups. Some have two handles and are shaped like an urn or olla; others
appear to be true pots. The want of uniformity among this tribe in the
use of vessels of this kind renders its difficult to class them
according to use. I will, therefore, group them according to form.
Except one or two of the little pots none of them are ornamented.

Pot-shaped vessels:

1737-1739. 1737, (41360); 1738, (41379); 1739, (41385); two handles as
  in Fig. 524.

1740-1741. 1740, (41380), and 1741, (41405). Without handle, the latter
  possibly used as a drinking vessel.

1742-1746. 1742, (41381); 1743, (41382); 1744, (41383); 1745, (41384);
  1746, (41386); each with a handle on one side; they resemble pitchers
  or cups.

_TOY-LIKE VESSELS._

1747. (41416). Like a small water-vessel.

1748. (41442). Olla-shaped, with handles; decorated with a band of loops
  around the middle.

1749. (41451). Olla.

1750-1751. 1750, (41452), and 1751, (41453). Cylindrical jars without
  handles.

  the usual shape.

1754. (42367). Flat jar-shaped vessel, red ware, with regular ears on
  the sides with holes through them. Cooking vessel; new.

1755. (42369). Small globular red bowl, half burned.

1756. (42370). Part of a corrugated vessel. It is yellow, but partly
  burned; it looks fresh and new, but is really old, having been out of
  the ground of old ruins near Wolpi.

_LADLES._

Of these vessels, which are extensively used by the Shinumos, there are
various forms with an almost endless variation in decoration, being
generally of ornamented white ware. Some of them bear a strong
resemblance to the skillets used on cooking stoves, the handle being
looped, but the bowl is more saucer-shaped. Others, as shown in Figs.
527 and 529, are evidently fashioned after gourds. Some are somewhat of
the form shown in Figs. 439 and 440, but the handle is more distinct.
Others are true cup-shaped vessels, with the handles projecting from the
middle of the side. A few are double with a single handle.

Skillet-shaped vessels. Usually decorated in the bowl. As these figures
are generally similar to those already described, special notice will be
taken only of such forms as vary from the normal shape and figures.

1757-1758. 1757, (41396), and 1758, (41395). Gourd shaped; similar to
  those shown in Figs. 527 and 529.

1759-1760. 1759, (41378), and 1760, (41397). Outside covered with
  checkers.

1768. (41477). Handle with animal head on the tip; outside covered with
  checkered figures.

1769. (41479). Handle as in the preceding; oblique, doubly serrate lines
  on outside of bowl.

  of the last.

1773-1774. 1773, (41483), and 1774, (41484); the handle of the latter
  represents an animal's head, with face turned toward the bowl.

1775-1777. 1775, (41388); 1776, (41389); 1777, (41425). The handle of
  this represents, in shape, the head of a woman and child, and the bowl
  contains the figures of two faces.

1778-1783. 1778, (41462); 1779, (41471); 1780, (41472); 1781, (41473);
  1782, (41474); 1783, (41475). The last of these has a minute head of a
  woman on the end of the handle, which is solid.

1784-1785. 1784, (41485), and 1785, (41486). Bowls elaborately
  ornamented with geometrical figures and a circle of serratures, in
  which is a figure resembling a duck with spread wings seen from above.

1786-1788. 1786, (41487); 1787, (41488); 1788, (41489); the last with a
  woman's head on the tip of the solid handle.

  have bent, gourd-like handles, slightly curved or hooked at the end,
  solid and somewhat rounded.

1802-1811. 1802, (41502); 1803, (41504); 1804, (41505); 1805, (41507);
  1806, (41515) 1807, (41518), Fig. 525; 1808, (41519); 1809, (41522);
  1810, (41523); 1811, (41525).

_STATUETTES._

The clay images or statuettes obtained from the Shinumo pueblos are not
objects of worship as supposed by many persons, but appear to be used to
adorn their dwellings just as similar articles are used by civilized
races. This is evident from their form and ornamentation which rudely
represent the ordinary clothing worn by these Indians, and in the female
figures the usual mode of wearing the hair either in a bunch at the back
of the head or in two wheel-shaped knots at the sides. In a few
instances ear ornaments, made of pieces of shells or beads, are found
attached to the ears.

I am not aware that these images are used in their dances or religious
ceremonies. If they are objects of worship it must be in the family
only, or a secret worship of which I obtained no information.

Images are introduced, however, in their dances and religious rites, but
these are made of wood and highly ornamented, some of which were
obtained and are hereafter described.

1841. (42026). Composed of the same clays of which the general pottery
  is made, with small lines of a brick-red color up and down the body;
  black lines over the shoulder and around the body, terminating so as
  to represent hands; small earlets, made of blue beads, suspended from
  the ears; face in white, with black spots to represent month and eyes;
  horn-shaped cap, extending obliquely back from the head. Represents a
  male figure.

1842. (42027). Same as above, except the head, which has a square bunch
  at its back, representing the one method of wearing the hair by the
  Shinumos. Male figure.

1843. (42028). Same as No. 1841, especially in regard to the horn-shaped
  protrusion from the back of the head.

1844. (42029). Plain flat image, probably intended to represent a
  female.

1845. (42030). This image is quite characteristic of this class of
  objects. The cut shows all but the colors, which are the same as
  described above, the form only differing from No. 1841 in having two
  horns curving back from the head. Seen in Fig. 533.

1846. (42031). Differs only from the rest in having a small hat on the
  head.

1847. (42032). Female figure, but with a black band around under the
  chin, apparently representing whiskers; dark brown body.

  1871, (42090).

The following numbers refer to specimens of the spiral or coiled
basketry, all the features of which are shown in Fig. 536, except the
color decoration:

1872-1907. 1872, (42058); 1873, (42051); 1874, (42052); 1875, (42053);

  (42059); 1881, (42060); 1882, (42061); 1883, (42062); 1884, (42063);
  1885, (42064); 1886, (42065); 1887, (42066); 1888, (42067); 1889,
  (42068); 1890, (42069); 1891, (42070); 1892, (42071); 1893, (42072);
  1894, (42090); 1895, (42073); 1896, (42074); 1897, (42075); 1898,
  (42091); 1899, (42092); 1900, (42093); 1901, (42094); 1902, (42095);

  (42100).

The following are canteen or water baskets, previously described, as to
method of making and using them:

1908-1912. 1908, (42101); 1909, (42102); 1910, (42103); 1911, (42104);
  1912, (42105); are vase-shaped baskets, of which Fig. 537 is a
  representative example.

The following are specimens of the same ware, differing only in form and
size:

1913-1920. 1913, (42106); 1914, (42107); 1915, (42108); 1916, (42109);
  1917, (42110); 1918, (42111); 1919, (42112); 1920, (42113).

1921-1925. 1921, (42114); 1922, (42115); 1923, (42116); 1924, (42117);
  1925, (42118), are only noticeable on account of their peculiar form.
  They are almost top-shaped, with an acute apex at the bottom. The
  mouth is small, like that of a jug. In one instance (42114) the body
  slopes from top and bottom to the center, almost forming a ridge. Very
  few of this form were obtained.

1926. (42119). A double-lobed canteen basket. Many of the clay
  water-vessels in the collection are made in imitation of this
  double-lobed basket.

1927-1931. 1927, (42120); 1928, (42121); 1929, (42122); 1930, (42123);
  1931, (42124). Ordinary forms of the water-basket.

1932. (42125). A fine, large, and quite perfect specimen, of the jug or
  water-basket, with ears of horse-hair and string attached for use.
  Quite a number of the ancient water-jars are of this form, and both
  bear evidence of antiquity.

1933. (42149). Fig. 538 is a good illustration of this form.

1934-1937. 1934, (42146); 1935, (42147); 1936, (42148); 1937, (42150),
  are of the same class of cemented basket-ware. The small
  fruit-baskets, made of round willows and with much less care, are also
  of many forms. Some are square, others round, and some with a peculiar
  flattened body; of the latter there are but few in the collection.
  They belong to the older class of basketry.

The following specimens belong to that class:

1938-1941. 1938, (42126); 1939, (42127); 1940, (42128); 1941, (42129).

1942. (42130). A specimen of a much finer quality than the preceding. It
  is long and vase-shaped, with a wide mouth and flaring rim, and woven
  up from the bottom in oblique ridges.

1943. (42131). A coarsely constructed bowl-shaped basket, of which type
  the following are also specimens:

1944-1951. 1944, (42132); 1945, (42133); 1946, (42134); 1947, (42135);
  1948, (42136); 1949, (42137); 1950, (42138); 1951, (42139).

1952. (42140). Specimen of the older basketry, with large depressed
  body, flat bottom, and jar-like mouth.

1953-1956. 1953, (42141); 1954, (42142); 1955, (42143); 1956, (42144),
  are also different forms of the peach-basket.

1957. (42145). Fig. 540. A large floor or hearth mat frequently found in
  use among the Pueblos. The specimen in the collection exhibits some
  skill and taste in weaving it. The material of which it is made is a
  small round willow.

1958. (42151). A large deep basket, constructed by weaving coarse willow
  twigs around four upright posts or large sticks. It has a capacity of
  about two bushels.

1959. (42152). This is a small square basket of the same character.

1960. (42153). A specimen of this ware. It is shown in Fig. 539,
  exhibits a coarse, loose manner of construction. These are used as
  fruit-baskets.

1961-1962. 1961, (42154), and 1962, (42155). These are examples of the
  same kind.

1963. (42156). This specimen represents the finest quality of baskets in
  the collection. They are all more or less tastefully ornamented during
  the process of plaiting them. They are skillfully and closely woven,
  and are used for holding the finest of their flour and meal. These are
  undoubtedly of Apache manufacture. Fig. 541.

1964. (42157). Has been selected as an illustration of this class of
  baskets, of which the following are examples, differing but little in
  form:

The following baskets are made from the broad leaves of the yucca, woven
or plaited crosswise in a very simple manner, and wrapped at the rims
with leaves of the same plant. The texture of the weaving is quite
coarse, not sufficiently close to hold any material smaller than corn or
fruit:

1988-2006. 1988, (42176); 1989, (42177); 1990, (42178); 1991, (42179);

  drill used for perforating stone and shell charms and ornaments. The
  addition of a cross stick and strings, with the flint tip, are only
  necessary to convert it into a drill. In both the drills and whorls
  the disks are made of horn, stone, bone, and wood. For the drill see

_STATUETTES._

These objects vary in form, size, and decoration, the largest being
about thirty inches high, the smallest not more than five. They are
objects of worship in one form or another. The illustrations in the
woodcuts and colored plates will convey a better idea of them than could
be given in a description. They are entirely composed of wood, with
feathers and other small ornaments attached to them occasionally.

2157. (41951). This is the largest one of these images in the
  collection, very highly ornamented with bright variegated colors. See
  Fig. 571.

2158. (41952). One of these objects, differing only in size and manner
  of decoration.

2159. (41953). This is a specimen of one of these images exhibited in
  Fig. 567. The form is common to many of them, showing the pyramidal
  projections attached to the head, with feathered tips.

2165. (41959). Fig. 566. The general characteristics of this specimen
  are the same as those already referred to, but it differs in the
  arrangement of the head attachments; two rows of pyramids are shown;
  the lower one is inverted; the two rows are separated by three arches;
  the upper pyramids are ornamented at the tips with feathers. A
  necklace of acorn hulls is around the neck, with a shell ornament
  attached to it. Garters are represented at the knees. In this
  specimen, as in many others, the feet are only represented by stubs.
  The body is decorated to represent fancifully colored clothing.

2166-2168. 2166, (41960); 2167, (41961); 2168, (41962). Similar to the

  from those previously mentioned. As will be observed by reference to
  the figure, it has a conical projection from the top of the head,
  representing a hat with a feather at the top, with two short, round
  blocks at the base of the hat, and two round balls to represent ears.
  The skirt is of cloth. The specimen is brilliantly decorated with
  paint.

2175. (41969). A brilliantly colored image, which is well shown in
  colors in Fig. 572.

  by small circles, in each of which there is the form of a cross.

2325. (42409). Fig. 596. The ornamentation on this piece is rather
  peculiar and worthy of attention, especially the bands around the
  columns.

2326. (42411). Double pepper and salt box, square form, with two handles
  side by side; birds mounted on the handles; figures of elk on the
  sides and ends in procession.

2327. (42475). Moccasin; rude.

_PITCHERS._

These are well formed, evidently in imitation of those introduced by the
white population. All similar in form, with handles. White ware with
decorations; of medium size.

2328. (41298). Shown in Fig. 592.

2329. (42405). Diamond scroll in the upper zone; a band of triangles
  with points directed upward in lower zone.

2330. (42406). Flower or rosette in upper zone, one on each side; no
  other figures.

2331. (42407). Broad band around the neck, from which two long-pointed
  triangles or acuminate figures point downwards; then another simple
  straight band, and below this a zigzag band.

2332. (42408). Scroll band around the neck; a band of hour-glass figures
  around the shoulder.

2333. (42410). With an undulate band around the bowl.

_EFFIGIES._

These are of white decorated ware, and in the form of birds and
quadrupeds; the orifice being usually in the top of the head, but in
birds it is occasionally at the tail, and in the quadruped forms
sometimes in the breast.

Birds.

These are frequently without feet, &c.; one or two double ones are on
pedestals.

2334-2347. 2334, (41301); 2335, (41302), Fig. 597; 2336, (41303), Fig.
  598; 2337, (41304); 2338, (41305); 2339, (42414), Fig. 608; 2340,
  (42415), Fig. 599; 2341, (42418), Fig. 609; 2342, (42419); 2343,
  (42423); 2344, (42426); 2345, (42427); 2346, (42428); 2347, (42429),
  are all similar to that represented in the Figures; some of them are
  intended to represent other birds than ducks.

2348. (42417). Fig. 600. With two heads on a pedestal.

2349. (42420). Two heads, but not on a pedestal; a handle on the back in
  the form of a fox or dog. See Fig. 605.

2350-2352. 2350, (42421); 2351, (42422); 2352, (42424). Similar to those
  shown in Fig. 598, but the decorations are scrolls and triangular
  figures. The first has a flower or rosette on the breast.

2353. (42425). Two-headed; not on pedestal; lines, triangles, &c.

2354. (42435). With a crest and long tail; apparently a rooster.

Quadrupeds.

2355. (41306). Fig. 601. This represents a sheep. The orifice is in
  front of the head.

2356-2357. 2356, (41307), Fig. 609, and 2357, (41309). These are
  probably intended for sheep, but they are so rude that it is not
  possible to determine with any certainty. Bark colored.

2358. (41308). A cow; although rude, the characteristics are well given,
  even to the hoofs and udder; spotted on the back and breast. Coloring
  on the sides intended to represent hair.

2359. (42430). Shown in Fig. 606.

2360. (42431). Fig. 602. This and the preceding figure are evidently
  intended to represent rabbits.

2361-2362. 2361, (42432), and 2362, (42433). Similar to the last;
  apparently intended for a figure of the ass (_Burro_), though the
  spots on the former are inappropriate. The latter is decorated on the
  side with the figure of another quadruped.

2363. (42434). Animal unknown.

2364-2365. 2364, (42436), and 2365, (42437). Animal not determinable;
  decorated with spots.

  (42441); 2370, (42442); 2371, (42443). Antelope and elk. The first is
  evidently an antelope, and possibly the third and fifth. The rest are
  certainly elk. Decorations simple.

2372. (42444). Probably a dog or coyote, with scrolls and diamond
  figures. See Fig. 604.

2373. (42445). Probably a horse.

Human figures--dolls.

2374-2377. 2374, (42447); 2375, (42448); 2376, (42449); 2377, (42450).
  Females; simple.

2378. (42446). Is a pretty fair representation of a chair.

_EATING BOWLS._

The Laguna bowls are mostly of two sizes, either large or small. The
former are eating bowls and are of the general form, or perhaps more
hemispherical than usual. The small ones vary in shape from the
preceding form to that of a flat-bottomed basin. The decorations present
but little similarity to those we have previously described from other
tribes; white ware with colored decorations.

Small bowls. Decorations all external:

2379. (41296). Square mouth, with two sides somewhat flattened. Scrolls
  and leaf-like figures on the outside.

2380. (41297). Fig. 616. Shown in the figure.

2381. (42451). Basin-shaped, with a handle on one side and a lip on the
  other; simple marginal and basal band with oblique lines.

2382. (42452). Fig. 617. Same form, with handle on which is seated some
  animal, apparently a dog, no lip. Band of diamond figures with central
  spaces. These two are the only specimens which have handles.

The following are quite small, basin-shaped, decorated with leaflike
figures:

2383-2388. 2383, (42453); 2384, (42454); 2385, (42457); 2386, (42458);
  2387, (42459); 2388, (42460).

The two following are small, of regular form:

2389. (42455). With two zigzag lines around the body.

2390. (42456). With geometrical figures.

Large bowls.

2391. (41265). No external decorations; radiating lines and large spaces
  inside.

2392. (42474). Inner zigzag marginal line as on Zuni bowls; outer
  decorations also somewhat like the usual triangular figures on the
  Zuni bowls.

The following are without inner decorations:

2393-2395. 2393, (42466); 2394, (42468); 2395, (42472). With broad band
  of geometrical figures; the first with a narrow scalloped band
  bordering the large band below.

2396-2397. 2396, (42461), and 2397, (42473), Fig. 613. With irregular
  geometrical figures; no band.

2398. (42469). With diamond marginal band; irregular figures below. Fig.
  614.

2399. (42470). The large circular scroll with irregular figures; no
  band.

2400. (42471). Scalloped circle with a square in it, and leaf-like
  figures. Fig. 615.




COLLECTIONS FROM ACOMA.


ARTICLES OF CLAY.

_WATER VASES._

There are but few pieces of this pottery, yet a careful examination of
these since my return increases my desire to procure more. The Acoma
bears a strong resemblance, especially in the ornamentation, to that
from Laguna. All that was obtained was of white ware with decorations in
color. In this pottery, in most cases where animals are figured, they
have a base or ground on which to stand.

2401. (39578). Medium size, figures of birds, ant-hills, and cactus. No
  band on the neck.

2402. (39581). Fig. 618.

2403. (39582). Very pretty specimen, quite symmetrical, broad
  jar-shaped, a scalloped band on the neck with little tassels suspended
  from it, possibly intended to imitate fringe. Large triangles on the
  body pointing to the right, each tipped with a flower.

2404. (39730). Small scalloped band around the neck similar to Fig. 624.

2405. (41310). Large double band of triangles on the neck; body with a
  band of large diamonds, or squares placed as diamonds, with checkered
  centers and crescents.

2406. (41313). No band on the neck; birds and ant hills.

2407. (41314). No band on neck; large elk and some irregular figures.

2408. (41315). No band on neck; bird on the ground amid leaves and
  flowers.

2409. (41316). Fig. 619. The ornamentation on this is more than usually
  spirited.

2410. (41318). Scalloped margin, no neck-band; belt of large open
  diamonds around the body, each upper corner capped with three leaves.
  See Fig. 621.

2411. (41317). Large size; a double band of crescents around the neck;
  then on the shoulder an arched band with a central stripe of diamonds;
  below this a double line of inverted crescents, and below this a large
  three-leafed plant. See Fig. 620.

2412. (42378). Plain.

2413. (42383). Small, with lines of outline crescents around the body.

2414. (42377). See Fig. 622.

_PITCHERS._

White decorated ware with handles:

2415. (41311). Regular form, of medium size, with a broad zigzag band
  around the neck and another around the body. The latter has in each
  large fold something like an arrow-head with point broken off.

2416. (41312). Olla-shaped neck with snort oblique bands; body with
  large and small triangles.

_EATING BOWLS._

The following specimens are small:

2417. (42461). Shaped exactly like the small soup bowl in use at the
  present day among the whites; with foot encircled by a vine with
  well-formed leaves. A pretty piece.

2418. (42462). Regular form, with an outline zigzag band.

2419. (42463) and (42464). Very small, conical in shape, the former
  marked with slender lines running around it, the latter with dots.




COLLECTION FROM COCHITI.


ARTICLES OF CLAY.

_WATER VESSELS._

Size: height 6 to 9 inches, diameter 6 to 15 inches.

These are of the same form as those of Zuni, but the curves and outlines
are much more graceful, and there is a delicacy in the finish which
places them above the Zuni pottery and indicates a greater freedom and
confidence in the ceramic artist. The rim is often slightly flared, the
neck more distinct and regularly formed.

The only figure given of this interesting group is not one of the
regularly formed specimens. They are all white ware with decorations in
black.

2420. (39501). Scalloped band around the neck; body divided into three
  compartments by upright double lines with rosette in one and twigs in
  the others.

2421. (39502), Pueblo or terraced figures around the body bordered by an
  undulate line below. This is of special interest.

2422. (39503). Decorated with sunflower, the stem and leaves on the
  body; straight and undulate lines around the neck.

2423. (39504). Decorated with straight and undulate bands.

2424. (39505). With figures of birds on the neck; and a tolerably well
  executed true meander or Greek fret around the body. Evident imitation
  of European pattern.

2425. (39506). Straight and undulate lines on the neck, triangle
  pointing downwards, leaves and insects on the body.

2426. (39509). Depressed; with rosettes and geometrical figures on the
  upper half of the body.

2427. (39634). Globular in form, without neck; scalloped marginal band;
  figures of chickens on the body.

2428. (39731). Fig. 624. Small size.

2429. (39733). Small size, similar in form to the preceding, with
  scalloped band around the neck, and scalloped arches on the body.
  Shown in Fig. 623.

Globular vessels with handles, used for holding water. These are of two
forms: those which are almost or quite spherical, with wide month at the
top; and those which resemble tea-pots, and open through a spout in the
form of the head of a bird or other animal. These are sometimes
globular, with opening at the top. Size shown in the illustrations.

2430. (39557). Undulate band around the margin; figures of fish on the
  body.

2431. (39558). Undulate line round the margin; figures of deer, bird,
  and fruit.

2432. (39559). With figures of triangles and leaves on the body.

2433. (39560). With head of a bird projecting from one side; marked with
  outline triangular and lunar figures on the body.

2434. (39561). Head of an animal projecting from one side.

Canteen-shaped vessels, with openings through a spout in the form of the
head of some animal. In some instances, where these are in the form of a
bird with the head for a spout, at the opposite end or side is the
representation of a tail, but often the latter is wanting. Handle
single, and usually on the top, unless otherwise specially mentioned.

2435-2436. 2435, (39563), and 2436, (39567). These are bird-shaped, with
  simple meander bands round the neck, and procession or herd of sheep
  or goats on the body. Head and tail shown. The former is seen in Fig.
  625.

2437. (39564). Form of a bird without tail; decorations simple.

2438. (39565). Shown in Fig. 626.

2439. (39568). Bird without tail; figure of an Indian with a gun in his
  hand, leading a calf followed by a cow.

2440. (39569). Bird with rude tail; figures of fishes and bird and a
  scalloped band below.

2441. (39570). Bird without tail; feather figures on breast; oblique
  checkered band to represent wing.

  serrate bands around the necks; figures of birds on the body.

2443. (39572). Representing a double-headed duck, with a single tail at
  opposite end; square handle; outline flower or rosette on the body.

2444. (39573). Form and decorations shown in Fig. 627. Probably intended
  for a dog.

2445. (39574). Form like preceding; decorations, fish, and grass; latter
  well shown.

2446. (39575). Similar in form to preceding, but with the fore-legs
  added. Decorations, collar or band around the neck and fish, on the
  body.

2447. (39579). Without handle, canteen-shaped, with dark head on one
  side; decorated with flowers and birds.

2448. (39696). Bird's head on top, tail present, no handle; jug-shape;
  feather on back, scrolls and flower on the side.

  decorations.

2451. (39699). Similar in form, but not open on top. Man, boy, and
  birds, with lines or shading to represent the ground.

2452-2458. 2452, (39701); 2453, (39713); 2454, (39715); 2455, (39720);
  Fig. 628; 2456, (39725), Fig. 629; 2457, (39727); 2458, (39730). These
  are somewhat of bird form, with globular body and without tail. Nos.
  2455, 2456, and 2457 are open on top, the others are not. Decorated
  with figures of birds, and sometimes flowers or twigs. The bird
  figures on No. 2453 (39713) are evidently intended for turkeys. This
  is without handle, and open at the top.

  also trees.

2460. (39703). Duck-shaped, without tail; rude figures of animals and

2485. (39515). Rosette of leaves on the back; tail well formed, probably
  represents the dove.

2486. (39516). No head, merely a spout; decorations simple.

2487. (39517). Evidently intended for a hen.

2488. (39518). Fig. 642.

2489. (39584). Simulates a hen; feathers on the back, deer on the sides.

2490. (39585). With handle, wings rudely figured. Shown in Fig. 641.

  pigment from the mortar was poured and used with the brush of the
  artist for decorative purposes. This is the only specimen of the kind
  in the collection, and the only one found where the pestle combines
  the cup with it.

2733. (39659). A jug-shaped pitcher of decorated red ware, with regular
  handle neatly formed. Ornamented with a looped vine and twigs, with
  leaves well drawn; neck slender and orifice with lip, but less in
  proportion than in ordinary pitcher.




COLLECTION FROM JEMEZ.


ARTICLES OF CLAY.

2734. (39926). Fig. 676. A very singular and pretty water vessel,
  obtained at the Jemez pueblo. White ware decorated in black and brown.
  It is probable that the peculiar form is given from mere fancy, and
  not for the purpose of adapting it to any particular use, as it
  appears to be simply a water vessel.

COLLECTION FROM THE JICARILLA APACHES.


ARTICLES OF CLAY.

This is a light brown micaceous ware, and the pieces are all small, or
comparatively so. They consist of pots, pitchers, and cups.

This small collection, though not obtained directly from the Jicarilla
Apaches, is attributed to them, for the reason that wherever found among
other tribes it is by them accredited to the Apaches. It is
manufactured, however, by some of the Pueblos along the Rio Grande, and
occasionally by the more western Pueblos. The party did not visit the
Apaches mentioned, and are not positively certain that they manufacture
pottery. These facts are mentioned in this connection to show that there
is some question as to the origin of this small collection.

Vase-shaped pots:

2735-2741. 2735, (39535); 2736, (39536); 2737, (39537); 2738, (39538);
  2739, (39539); 2740, (39540); 2741, (39544). This and the next two
  have the rims scalloped.

2742-2744. 2742, (39545); 2743, (39546); 2744, (39547).

Pot-shaped:

2745-2751. 2745, (39595); 2746, (39596); 2747, (39597); 2748, (39598);
  2749, (39599); 2750, (39600); 2751, (39851).

Pitchers and cups, with handles of regular form:

2752. (39543). Finger impressions around the middle.

2753-2754. 2753, (39540), and 2754, (39548). Scalloped margin.

2755. (39770). With an undulate impressed line around the middle.

Miscellaneous:

2756. (39852). Incense-burner, somewhat in the shape of a beaver hat,
  with a rim in the form of a bird; a small orifice in the middle.

2757. (39853). Bird image.




COLLECTIONS FROM OLD PECOS.


ARTICLES OF STONE.

2758. (39756). Flint scraper. Rudely shaped, of hard cherty rock, flat
  on the inner face, convex on the back.

2759. (39757). An irregular square flat piece of sand-stone, on one side
  of which is a small circular cup-shaped depression.

2760. (39758a). A small mortar composed of fine-grained sand-stone,
  half broken away; being of quite soft stone, it was probably used for
  pulverizing food of some kind.

2761. (39758b). Quartz mortar made from, a round water-worn boulder.
  The cavity is symmetrical; diameter five inches.

2762. (39759). Half of a cherty water-worn boulder from which flakes for
  flints have been chipped.

2763. (39760). Small round cherty boulders, frequently used in chipping
  for flints, but in this instance they seem to have been used as
  hammers.

2764. (39761). Hammer made from a section of a broken rubbing or
  grinding stone of calcareous rock.

2765. (39762). Maul from broken rubbing stone or grinder, grooved at
  each end; rhyolite.

2766. (39763). Rudely shaped sinker (or what is called a sinker),

COLLECTIONS FROM THE CANON DE CHELLY.


ARTICLES OF CLAY.

_WATER VESSELS._

2786-2789. 2786, (40813), Fig. 678; 2787, (40814), Fig. 677; 2788,
  (40815), Fig. 679; 2789, (40816), Fig. 680. These pieces are white
  ware, decorated with black. The colors in great part still remain,
  showing that they are comparatively modern. The lines represent colors
  and not indentations.

2790. (40796). Fig. 681. Upper part broken; supposed to have been a
  pitcher, as part of the handle remains. From Cliff House ruins, Canon
  de Chelly. Red ware. Comparatively modern.

The following articles are ancient ware, from the same place as the
preceding:

2791. (40600). Small vase of white ware, probably comparatively modern.
  The design, though simple, is somewhat peculiar and different from
  what is usually found on pottery of the present day. See Fig. 683.

2792. (42202). Fig. 682. Similar in form, size, and color to the
  preceding; the design, as will be seen by reference to the figure, is
  a common one.

2793. (40812). Pitcher. White ware, with black decorations. See Fig.
  690.

2794-2795. 2794, (40819), Fig. 691, and 2795, (40820), Fig. 688.
  Pitchers, white; ware figured.

2796. (40824). Very small pitcher with handle; of uncolored ware.

2797. (42203). A very pretty pitcher of white ware, with decorations in
  black, much faded, showing age, although so well and truly formed it
  is evidently not modern. Fig. 692.

2798. (40601). A round-bottomed pitcher-shaped vessel, white ware with
  black lines; the colors are much faded, showing age. Fig. 689. The
  design is evidently of a previous age, and we will be justified,
  perhaps, in saying that it belongs to the period of transition from
  the rigid lines and angles to the curves.

2799. (40811). Fig. 687, Small pitcher, _e-musch-ton-ts[-a]n-n[-a]_,
  originally of white ware; bowl uncolored.

_BOWLS._

2800. (40823). Small bowl, with handle each side, white, with black
  colors. Fig. 684.

2801. (40825). A small paint-pot shown in Fig. 685.

2802. (40857). Fig. 686. A small pot, apparently blackened by fire,
  unadorned except with the spine-like projections around the lower
  half; probably used for a paint-pot.

_COOKING VESSELS._

2803-2806. 2803, (40817), Fig. 693; 2804, (40818), Fig. 696; 2805,
  (40821), Fig. 695; 2806, (40822), Fig. 694. These are the old
  corrugated ware, but with the exception of the third they do not show
  the action of fire, but were probably used for cooking vessels.




COLLECTIONS FROM PICTOGRAPH ROCKS.


ARTICLES OF CLAY.

  [Illustration:
  Fig. 697 (39873) (1/4)]

2807. (39873). Fig. 697. A corrugated pot 11 inches high and 10 inches
  in diameter at the widest point. Evidently coil-made; the different
  coils slightly overlap each other tile-fashion. On the inside it is
  smooth and does not show the coils. It has been blackened by the fire,
  the original color having been a dark slate, the natural color of
  the clay. It was evidently but slightly burned at first; very ancient.

_STATUETTES._

The following numbers are specimens of statuettes, of micaceous clay,
representing human beings in various attitudes, both male and female.
They are attributed to the Cochiti Pueblos, but as they were obtained in
Santa Fe from traders, the correctness of their origin may be doubted.
They were made, however, by some of the Rio Grande Pueblos not very
remote from Santa Fe:

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
