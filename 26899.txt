_The Arke of Artificial Day_.

Before proceeding, to point out the indelible marks by which Chaucer has,
as it were, stereotyped the true date of the journey to Canterbury, I shall
clear away another stumbling-block, still more insurmountable to Tyrwhitt
than his first difficulty of the "halfe cours" in Aries, viz. the seeming
inconsistency in statements (1.) and (2.) in the following lines of the
prologue to the Man of Lawe's tale:--

       { "Oure hoste saw wel that the bright sonne,
  (1.) {  The arke of his artificial day, had ironne
       {  The fourthe part and halfe an houre and more,
              *        *        *        *
       {  And saw wel that the shadow of every tree
       {  Was as in length of the same quantitie,
       {  That was the body erecte that caused it,
       {  And therefore by the shadow he toke his wit
  (2.) {  That Phebus, which that shone so clere and bright,
       {  Degrees was five and fourty clombe on hight,
       {  And for that day, as in that latitude
       {  It was ten of the clok, he gan conclude."

The difficulty will be best explained in Tyrwhitt's own words:--

    "Unfortunately, however, this description, though seemingly intended to
    be so accurate, will neither enable us to conclude with the MSS. that
    it was '_ten of the clock_,' nor to fix upon any other hour; as the two
    circumstances just mentioned are not found to coincide in any part of
    the 28th, or of any other day of April, in this
    climate."--_Introductory Discourse_, Sec. xiv.

In a foot-note, Tyrwhitt further enters into a calculation to show that, on
the 28th of April, the fourth part of the day and half an hour and more
(even with the liberal allowance of a quarter of an hour to the indefinite
phrase '_and more_') would have been completed by nine o'clock A.M. at the
latest, and therefore at least an hour too soon for coincidence with (2.).

Now one would think that Tyrwhitt, when he found his author relating facts,
"_seemingly intended to be so accurate_," would have endeavoured to
discover whether there might not be some hidden meaning in them, the
explaining of which might make that consistent, which, at first, was
apparently the reverse.

Had he investigated with such a spirit, he must have discovered that the
expression "arke of the artificial day" _could not_, in this instance,
receive its obvious and usual meaning, of the horary duration from sunrise
to sunset--

And for this simple reason: That such a meaning would _presuppose a
knowledge of the hour_--of the very thing in request--and which was about
{346} to be discovered by "our hoste," who "toke his wit" from the sun's
altitude for the purpose! But he knew already that the fourth part of the
day IN TIME had elapsed, he must necessarily have also known what that time
was, without the necessity of calculating it!

Now, Chaucer, whose choice of expression on scientific subjects is often
singularly exact, says, "Our hoste _saw_ that the sonne," &c.; he must
therefore have been referring to some visible situation: because,
afterwards, when the time of day has been obtained from calculation, the
phrase changes to "_gan conclude_" that it was ten of the clock.

It seems, therefore, certain that, even setting aside the question of
consistency between (1.) and (2.), we must, _upon other grounds_, assume
that Chaucer had some meaning in the expression "arke of the artificial
day," different from what must be admitted to be its obvious and received
signification.

To what other ark, then, could he have been alluding, if not to the
_horary_ diurnal ark?

I think, to the AZIMUTHAL ARCH OF THE HORIZON included between the point of
sunrise and that of sunset!

The situation of any point in that arch is called its bearing; it is
estimated by reference to the points of the compass; it is therefore
_visually_ ascertainable: and it requires no previous knowledge of the hour
in order to determine when the sun has completed the fourth, or any other,
portion of it.

Here, then, is _prima facie_ probability established in favour of this
interpretation. And if, upon examination, we find that it also clears away
the discrepancy between (1.) and (2.), probability becomes certainty.

Assuming, upon evidence which I shall hereafter explain, that the sun's
declination, on the day of the journey, was 13 deg. 26' North, or thirteen
degrees and half,--the sun's bearing at rising, in the neighbourhood of
London, would be E.N.E., at setting W.N.W.; the whole included arch, 224 deg.;
and the time at which the sun would complete one-fourth, or have the
bearing, S.E. by E., would be about 20 minutes past nine A.M.,--thus
leaving 40 minutes to represent Chaucer's "halfe an hour and more!"

A very remarkable approximation--which converts a statement apparently
contradictory, into a strong confirmation of the deduction to be obtained
from the other physical facts grouped together by Chaucer with such
extraordinary skill!

On the other hand, it is impossible to deny that the "hoste's" subsequent
admonition to the pilgrims to make the best use of their time, warning them
that "the fourthe partie of this day is gon," seems again to favour the
idea that it is the day's actual horary duration that is alluded to.

This can be only hypothetically accounted for by observing that in this, as
in many other instances, Chaucer seems to delight in a sort of disguised
phraseology; as though to veil his true meaning, and designedly to create
scientific puzzles to exercise the knowledge and discernment of his
readers.

FOREIGN ENGLISH--GUIDE TO AMSTERDAM.

I doubt not many of your readers will have been as much amused as myself
with the choice specimens of Foreign English enshrined in your pages. When
at Amsterdam, some years since, I purchased a _Guide_ to that city, which I
regard as a considerable literary curiosity in the same line. It was
published at Amsterdam, by E. Maascamp, in 1829, and contains from
beginning to end a series of broken English, professing all the while to be
written by an Englishman.

It commences with the following "Advertisement:"

    "The city of Amsterdam--remarkable as being one of the chief metropoles
    of Europe, and as being in many respects the general market of whole
    the universe; justly celebrated for--its large interior canals, on both
    of their sides enlivened and sheltered by ranges of large, thick, and
    beautiful trees, and presenting, on large broad and neatly kept, most
    regularly pav'd quays, long chains of sumptuous habitations, or rather
    palaces of the principal and _weathy_ merchants; moreover remarkable by
    its Museum for the objects of the fine arts, &c., its numberless public
    edifices adapted either to the _cultivation_ of arts, or to the
    exertions of trade, or to _establishments_ charitable purposes, or of
    temples of all manners of divine worship--the city of Amsterdam, we
    say," &c. It is dated "This 15^{the} of Juin, 1829."

In page 14. the author gives us an account of his habits, &c.:--

    "I live in Amsterdam since some considerable time I drink no strong
    liquors, nor do I smoke tobacco and with all this--I have not been
    _attacked_ by those agues and fevers w^h frequently reign here from the
    month of Juin to the end of the autumn: and twenty foreigners whom I
    know, do follow the same system, and are still as healthy as I myself;
    while I have seen a great many of natives taking their drams and
    smoking their pipes _ad libitem_, and moreover _chawing_ tobacco in a
    quite disgusting manner, who," &c.

An Amsterdam Sunday, p. 42.:

    "On sundays and holydays the shops and warehouses, and, _intra muros_,
    those of public entertainment are _close_: the devotees go to church,
    and sanctify the sabbath. Others go to walk outside the towngates:
    after their walk, they hasten to fine public-play-gardens, where wine,
    thea, &c. is sold. Neither the mobility remains idle at _these_
    entertainments. Every one invites his damsel, and joyously they enter
    play-gardens of a little less brilliancy than the former. There, at the
    crying sound of an instrument that _rents_ the ear, {347} accompanied
    by the delightful handle-organs and the rustic triangle, their tributes
    are paid to Terpsichore; every where a similitude of talents: the
    dancing outdoes not the musician."

Description of the Assize Court:

    "The forefront has a noble and sublime aspect, and is particularly
    characteristical to what it ought to represent. It is built in a
    division of three fronts in the corinthic order: each of them consists
    in four raizing columns, resting upon a general basement, from the one
    end of the forefront to the other, and supporting a cornish, equally
    running all over the face; upon this cornish rests a balustrad, like
    the other pieces altogether of Bremen-hardstone. The middle front,
    serving for the chief entrance, is adorned with the provincial arms,
    sculpted by Mr. Gabriel, &c.... Every where a sublime plan, and exact
    execution is exhibited here, and the whole tends as much to the
    architects, who are the undertakers of it, as they have earned great
    praizes by building anew the burnt Lutheran church."

I will not trespass on your space by any further extracts; but these will
suffice to show that my book is _sui generis_, and worth commemoration.

SEVEN CHILDREN AT A BIRTH THREE TIMES FOLLOWING.

Your correspondent N. D.'s papers (Vol. ii., p. 459., and Vol. iii., p. 64)
have reminded me of another remarkable instance of fecundity related by the
well-known civil engineer JAN ADRIAENSZ. LEEG-WATER, in his _Kleyne
Chronycke_, printed at Amsterdam in 1654:

    "Some years since," says he, p. 31., "I was at _Wormer_, at an inn near
    the town-hall: the landlady, whose name was _Frankjen_, told me of the
    Burgomaster of _Hoorn_, who in the spring went over the (Zuyder?) sea
    to buy oxen, and going into a certain house he found seven little
    children sitting by the fire, each with a porringer in its hand, and
    eating rice-milk, or pap, with a spoon; on which the Burgomaster said
    'Mother, you are very kind to your neighbours, since they leave their
    children to your care.' 'No,' said the woman, they are all my own
    children, which I had at one birth; and if you will wait a moment, I
    will show you more that will surprise you.' She then fetched seven
    other children _a birth_ older: so she had fourteen children at two
    births. Then the woman said to the Burgomaster, 'I am now _enceinte_,
    and I think in the same way as before: if you come here next year, call
    upon me again.' And so, the next year, when the Burgomaster went over
    the sea, he called upon the woman and the woman had again brought forth
    seven children at a birth. Thus the woman had at three births
    twenty-one children."

I subjoin the original of which the above is a literal translation.

RAMASSHED, MEANING OF THE TERM.

In the curious volume recently edited by Sir Henry Ellis for the Camden
Society, entitled _The Pilgrymage of Syr R. Guylforde, Knyght_, a singular
term occurs, which may claim a note of explanation. It is found in the
following passage:

    "Saterdaye to Suse, Noualassa, and to Lyungborugh; and at the sayd
    Noualassa we toke moyles to stey us vp the mountayne, and toke also
    marones to kepe vs frome fallynge. And from the hyght of the mounte
    down to Lyuyngborugh I was ramasshed, whiche is a right strange
    thinge."--P. 80.

Sir Henry has not bestowed upon us here any of those erudite annotations,
which have customarily enhanced the interest of works edited under his
care.

Sir Richard Guylforde was on his homeward course from the Holy Places by
way of Pavia, where he visited the convent and church which contained the
shrine and relics of St. Augustine, as also the tomb of Lionel, Duke of
Clarence, second son of Edward III., whose monumental inscription (not to
be found in Sandford's _Genealogical History_) the worthy knight copied.

On the 13th Feb. 1506, Sir Richard approached the ascent of Mont Cenis by
the way of S. Ambrogio and Susa. At the village of Novalese, now in ruins,
the party took mules, to aid their ascent, and _marroni_, long-handled
mattocks, or pick-axes, to prevent their falling on the dangerous
declivities of the snow. The journey was formerly made with frightful
expedition by means of a kind of sledge--an expedient termed _la
ramasse_--which enabled the traveller, previously to the construction of
that extraordinary road, well known to most readers, to effect in a few
minutes a perilous descent of upwards of 6000 feet. The _ramasse_, as
Cotgrave informs us, was--

    "A kind of high sled, or wheelbarrow, whereon travellers are carried
    downe certaine steep and slippery hils in Piemont."

Its simplest form had probably been a kind of fagot of
brushwood,--_ramazza_, or a besom, not much unlike the rapid locomotive of
witches, who were called in old times _ramassieres_, from their supposed
practice of riding on a _ramee_, _ramasse_, or besom. At the present time
even, it occasionally occurs that an adventurous traveller crossing the
Mont Cenis is tempted to glide down the rapid descent, in preference to the
long course of the zigzag road; and remember to have heard at Lauslebourg
the tale, doubtless often related, of an eccentric _Milord_ who ascended
the heights thrice from that place, a journey of some hours, for the
gratification of the repeated excitement caused by a descent on the
_ramasse_ in about as many minutes. The cranium of a horse, as it was
stated, was the vehicle often preferred for this curious adventure: and the
{348} traveller guided or steadied his course by trailing a long staff, a
practice for security well known to the Alpine tourist. This may probably
have been the use of the "marones" taken by Sir Richard Guyldeford and his
party at Novalese.

The terms, to be "ramasshed," is not, as I believe, wholly disused in
France. It was brought to the metropolis with the strange amusement known
as the _Montagne Russe_. In the valuable _Complement du Dictionnaire de
l'Academie_, compiled under the direction of Louis Barre, we find the
following phrase:

    "Se faire ramasser, se dit aujourd'hui, dans une acception
    particuliere, pour, Se faire lancer dans un char, du haut des
    elevations artificielles qui se trouvent dans les jardins publics."

Such a disport had been known previously to the expedition to Moscow, and
the favourite divertisement _a la Russe_, so much in vogue amongst the
Parisians for a few subsequent years. Roquefort informs us that--

    "_Ramasse_ etoit le nom d'un jeu que nous avions apporte des Alpes, ou
    il est encore en usage pendant l'hiver, et principalement en temps de
    neige."

Wright, the publisher of the _Anti-Jacobin_, lived at 169. Piccadilly, and
his shop was the general morning resort of the friends of the ministry, as
Debrell's was of the oppositionists. About the time when the _Anti-Jacobin_
was contemplated, Owen, who had been the publisher of Burke's pamphlets,
failed. The editors of the _Anti-Jacobin_ took his house, paying the rent,
taxes, &c., and gave it up to Wright, reserving to themselves the first
floor, to which a communication was opened through Wright's house. Being
thus enabled to pass to their own rooms through Wright's shop, where their
frequent visits did not excite any remarks, they contrived to escape
particular observation.

Their meetings were most regular on Sundays, but they not unfrequently met
on other days of the week, and in their rooms were chiefly written the
poetical portions of the work. What was written was generally left open
upon the table, and as others of the party dropped in, hints or suggestions
were made; sometimes whole passages were contributed by some of the parties
present, and afterwards altered by others, so that it is almost impossible
to ascertain the names of the authors. Where, in the above notes, a piece
is ascribed to different authors, the conflicting statements may arise from
incorrect information, but sometimes they arise from the whole authorship
being assigned to one person, when in fact both may have contributed. If we
look at the references, vol. ii. pp. 420. 532. 623., we shall see Mr.
Canning naming several authors, whereas Lord Burghersh assigns all to one
author. Mr. Canning's authority is here more to be relied upon. "New
Morality" Mr. Canning assigns generally to the four contributors; Mr.
Wright has given some interesting particulars by appropriating to each his
peculiar portion.

Gifford was the working editor, and wrote most of the refutations and
corrections of the "Lies," "Mistakes," and "Misrepresentations."

The papers on finance were chiefly by Pitt: the first column was frequently
for what he might send; but his contributions were uncertain, and generally
very late, so that the space reserved for him was sometimes filled up by
other matter. He only once met the editors at Wright's.

Upcott, who was at the time assistant in Wright's shop, was employed as
amanuensis, to copy out for the printer the various contributions, that the
authors' handwriting might not be detected.

_The Anti-Jacobin_ (Vol. iii., p. 334.).--In a copy of the _Poetry of the
Anti-Jacobin_, now in my possession, occurs this note in the autograph of
Mr. James Boswell:--

    "These lines [_Lines written by Traveller at Czarco-zelo_] were written
    by William PITT--as I learnt from his nephew on the 28th of May 1808,
    at a dinner held in honour of his memory."

The sirname is in large capital letters; the _year_ is indistinctly
written. This is the note which is indicated in the auction-catalogue of
the library of Mr. Boswell, No. 2229.

Minor Notes.

_Egg and Arrow Ornament._--Mr. Ruskin, in his _Stones of Venice_, vol. i.
p. 305., says--

    "The Greek egg and arrow cornice is a nonsense cornice, very noble in
    its lines, but utterly absurd in its meaning. Arrows have had nothing
    to do with eggs (at least since Leda's time), neither are the so-called
    arrows like arrows, nor the eggs like eggs, nor the honeysuckles like
    honeysuckles: they are all conventionalized into a monotonous
    successiveness of nothing--pleasant to the eye, useless to the
    thought."

The ornament of which Mr. R. thus speaks is indifferently called egg and
tongue, egg and dart, as well as egg and arrow. It seems to me that the
_egg_ is a complete misnomer, although common to all the designations; and
I fancy that the idea of what is so called was originally derived from the
full-length shield, and therefore that the ornament should be named the
_shield and dart_, an association more reasonable than is suggested by any
of the ordinary appellations. Can any of {350} your correspondents offer
any confirmation of this?

_Defoe's Project for purifying the English Language._--Among the many
schemes propounded by De Foe, in his _Essay upon Projects_, published in
1696, there is one which still remains a theory, although eminently
practicable, and well worthy of consideration.

He conceived that there might be an academy or society formed for the
purpose of correcting, purifying, and establishing the English language,
such as had been founded in France under Cardinal Richelieu.

    "The work of this society," says Defoe, "should be to encourage polite
    learning, to polish and refine the English tongue, and advance the so
    much neglected faculty of correct language; also, to establish purity
    and propriety of style, and to purge it from all the irregular
    additions that ignorance and affectation have introduced; and all these
    innovations of speech, if I may call them such, which some dogmatic
    writers have the confidence to foster upon their native language, as if
    their authority were sufficient to make their own fancy legitimate."

Never was such society more needed than in the present day, when you can
scarcely take up a newspaper, or a periodical, a new poem, or any modern
literary production, without finding some new-coined word, perplexing to
the present reader, and a perfect stumbling-block in the way of any future
editor.

Some of these words are, I admit, a welcome addition to our common stock,
but the greater part of them are mere abortions, having no analogy to any
given root.

A society similar to the one proposed by Defoe might soon be established in
this country, if a few such efficient authorities as Dr. Kennedy would take
the initiative in the movement.

He who should first establish such a society, and bring it to a practicable
bearing, would be conferring an inestimable boon on society.

I trust that these hints may serve to arouse the attention of some of the
many talented contributors to the "NOTES AND QUERIES," and in due season
bring forth fruit.

_Great Fire of London_.--Our popular histories of England, generally,
contain very indefinite statements respecting the extent of destruction
wrought upon the city of London by the Great Fire. I have therefore thought
it may be interesting to others, as it has been to myself, to peruse the
following, which purports to be "extracted from the Certificates of the
Surveyors soon after appointed to survey the Ruins."

    "That the fire that began in London upon the second of September, 1666,
    at one Mr. Farryner's house, a baker in Pudding Lane, between the hours
    of one and two in the morning, and continued burning until the sixth of
    that month, did overrun the space of three hundred and seventy-three
    acres within the walls of the city of London, and sixty-three acres
    three roods without the walls. There remained seventy-five acres three
    roods standing within the walls unburnt. Eighty-nine parish churches,
    besides chappels burnt. Eleven parishes within the walls standing.
    Houses burnt, Thirteen thousand two hundred.

PASSAGES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT ILLUSTRATED FROM DEMOSTHENES.

Acts xvii. 21.:

    "For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time
    in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing."

Can any of your biblical correspondents inform me in what commentary upon
the New Testament the coincidence with the following passages in
Demosthenes is noticed, or whether any other source of the historical fact
has been recorded? In the translation of Petrus Lagnerius, Franc. 1610 (I
have not at hand the entire works), we find these words:

    "Nihil est omnium, Athenienses, in praesentia nocentius, quam quod vos
    alienati estis a rebus, et tantisper operam datis, dum audientes
    sedetis, si quid Novi nuntiatum fuerit" (4. contr. _Phil_.).

Again:

    "Nos vero, dicetur verum, nihil facientes, hic perpetuo sedemus
    cunctabundi, tum decernentes, tum interrogantes, si quid Novi in foro
    dicatur."--4 _Orat. ad Philipp. Epist._

Pricaeus, in his very learned and valuable _Commentarii in varios N.T.
Libros_, Lond. 1660, fol., at p. 628, in v. 21., says only--

    "Videantur quae ex Demosthene, Plutarcho, aliis, _Eruditi_ annotarunt."

{351}

Matthew xiii. 14.:

    "And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By
    hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall
    see, and shall not perceive."

This proverb seems to have been common to all ages and countries. It is of
frequent occurrence in the New Testament (Mark iv. 12.; viii. 18.; John
xii. 40.; Acts xxviii. 25.; Romans xi. 8.), and, as in Matthew, is referred
to Isaiah. But, in the Old Testament, there is earlier authority for its
use in Deuteronomy xxix. 4. It occurs also in Jeremiah v. 21.; in Ezekiel
xii. 2., and, with a somewhat different application, in the Psalms, cxv.
5.; cxxxv. 16.

That it was employed as an established proverb by Demosthenes seems to have
been generally overlooked. He says:

    [Greek: Hoi men houtos horontes ta ton etuchekoton erga, hoste totes
    paroimias, horontes me horan, kai akouontas me akouein. (Kata
    Aristogeitonos,] A Taylor, Cantab. vol. ii. pp. 494-5.)

It is quoted, however, by Pricaeus (p. 97.), who also supplies exactly
corresponding passages from Maximus Tyrius (A.D. 190), Plutarch (A.D.
107-20), and Philo (A.D. 41). Of these, the last only can have been prior
to the publication of St. Matthew's Gospel, which Saxius places, at the
earliest, in the reign of Claudius.

Hugo Grotius has no reference to Demosthenes in his _Annotationes in Vet.
Test.,_ Vogel & Doderein, 1776; but cites Heraclitus the Ephesian, who,
according to Saxius, flourished in the year 502 B.C., and Aristides, who,
on the same authority, lived in the 126th year of the Christian era. Has
any other commentator besides Pricaeus alluded to the passage in
Demosthenes?

THE HOUSE OF MAILLE.

The house of Maille (vide Lord Mahon's _Life of Conde_) contributed to the
Crusades one of its bravest champions. Can any of your numerous
contributors give me information as to the name and achievements of the
Crusader?

Claire Clemence de Maille, daughter of the Marechal Duke de Breze, and
niece of Richelieu, was married in 1641 to the Duc d'Enghien, afterwards
the Great Conde; and Lord Mahon, somewhere in his life of the hero, makes
mention of the princess as the "last of her family."

Claire Clemence had an only brother, who held the exalted post of High
Admiral of France, and in 1646 he commanded a French fleet which
disembarked 8000 men in the marshes of Sienna, and himself shortly
afterwards fell at the siege of Orbitello. The admiral having died
unmarried, the Breze estates became the property of the princess, who
transmitted them to her descendants, the last of whom was the unfortunate
Duc d'Enghien, who perished at Vincennes.

Thus much is patent; but I think it probable his lordship was not aware
that a branch of the family was exiled, and with the La Touches, La
Bertouches, &c., settled in the sister kingdom, most likely at the
Revocation of the Edict of Nantes. Their descendants subsequently passed
over into this country, and have contributed to the lists of the legal and
medical professions. Up to the present century a gentleman bearing the
slightly altered name of Mallie held a commission in the British army. Even
now, the family is not extinct, and the writer being lately on a visit to a
lady, probably the sole representative _in name_ of this once powerful
house, noticed in her possession a series of four small engravings,
representing the Great Conde; his mother, a princess of Montmorency,
pronounced to be the "handsomest woman in Europe;" the old Marechal de
Maille Breze; and his daughter, Claire Clemence.

Our _Pall Mall_ is, I believe, derived from _Pailee Maille_, a game
somewhat analogous to cricket, and imported from France in the reign of the
second Charles: it was formerly played in St. James's Park, and in the
exercise of the sport a small hammer or _mallet_ was used to strike the
ball. I think it worth noting that the _Mallie_ crest _is_ a mailed arm and
hand, the latter grasping a _mallet_.

Be it understood that the writer has no pretensions to a knowledge of
heraldic terms and devices; so, without pinning any argument on the
coincidence, he thought it not without interest. He is aware that the mere
fact of a similarity between surnames and crests is not without its
parallel in English families.

_What was the Day of the Accession of Richard III.?_--Sir Harris Nicolas,
in his _Chronology of History_ (2nd edition, p. 326.) decides for June 26,
1433, giving strong reasons for such opinion. But his primary reason,
founded on a fac-simile extract from the Memoranda Rolls in the office of
the King's Remembrancer in the Exchequer of {352} Ireland, printed, with
fac-simile, in the second _Report of the Commissioners on Irish Records_,
1812, p. 160., gives rise to a doubt; for, as Sir Harris Colas states,

    "It is remarkable that the printed copy should differ from the
    fac-simile in the identical point which caused the letter to be
    published, for in the former the 'xxvij^{th} of June' occurs, whereas
    in the fac-simile it is the 'xxvj^{th} of June.' The latter is
    doubtless correct; for an engraver, who copies precisely what is before
    him, is less likely to err than a transcriber or editor."

This is most probably the case; but perhaps some of your correspondents in
Ireland will settle the point accurately.

Rev. Mr. Bowen, of Bath. Since then, I think, it was sold by auction; at
least I have heard so. Perhaps some of your readers know what has become of
it, and can say where it now is. The name "Richard Whiting" is said to be
engraved inside it.

_Laurence Howel, the Original Pilgrim._--The unfortunate Laurence Howel
published in 1717 (the year in which he was committed to Newgate) a little
volume, entitled _Desiderius; or, the Original Pilgrim, a Divine Dialogue,
showing the most compendious Way to arrive at the Love of God. Rendered
into English, and explained, with Notes._ By Laurence Howel, A.M. London;
printed by William Redmayne, for the Author, 1717. In the preface he tells
us, that the work was originally written in Spanish; afterwards translated
into Italian, French, High-Dutch and Low-Dutch, and about the year 1587
into Latin from the High-Dutch, by Laurentius Surius. There were
subsequently two more Latin versions: one by Vander Meer, from the French
and Dutch copies, compared with the original; and another by Antonius
Boetzer in 1617. The author's name, he says, was unknown to all the
editors, and the several editions had different titles; by some it was
called the _Treasure of Devotion_, by others the _Compendious Way to
Salvation_. The last, however (Boetzer's, I presume), bears that of
_Desiderius_. As this was the author's title, Mr. Howel adopted it for his
translation, adding, he says, that of the _Original Pilgrim_, to
distinguish it from others of the same name, or very like it. He there
informs us that Mr. Royston (the distinguished publisher in Charles II.'s
and James II.'s reigns) had declared that Bishop Patrick took his _Parable
of the Pilgrim_ from it, and that it had formed the ground-work of the
writings of many authors in that style.

Can any of your readers give me the titles of the editions in Spanish, or
any language, of this interesting little book? I should be much obliged for
any information regarding it. Is Howel's little translation scarce? Has the
authorship of the original ever been hinted at?

_The Churchwardens' Accounts, &c., of St. Mary-de-Castro,

religious guild of The Trinity connected with the church. All these
documents have now, however, entirely disappeared,--how, or at what period
since the publication of the work, is unknown; but I find by a
newspaper-cutting in my possession (unfortunately without date or
auctioneer's name), that a very large collection of ancient documents,
filling several boxes, and relating to this church and others in the
county, was sold by auction in London some years ago, probably between the
years 1825 and 1830. I shall feel obliged if any of your correspondents can
inform me in whose possession they now are, and if they can be consulted.

received date; but it is found in one printed in London in 1707 immediately
before the Articles. Its appearance in the Prayer Book is entirely
unauthorised; and it would be curious to ascertain also, whether it found a
place in the Prayer Books printed at Oxford or Cambridge.

_West Chester._--In maps of Cheshire, 1670, and perhaps later, the city of

so called now. Passing through a village only six miles from London last
week, I heard a mother saying to a child, "If you are not a good girl I
will send you to West Chester." "Go to Bath" is common enough; but why
should either of these places be singled out? The Cheshire threat seems to
have been in use for some time, unless that city is still called West
Chester.

_The Milesians._--With respect to the origin of the Milesian race little
seems to be known, even by antiquaries who have given their attention to
the archaeology of Ireland, the inhabitants of which country are reputed to
have been of Milesian origin. The Milesian race, also, is thought to have
come over from Spain, a conjecture which is rather confirmed by the
etymology of the names of some Irish towns, where the letters _gh_, as in
Drogheda and Aghada, if so convertible, have the same pronunciation as the
Spanish _j_ in Aranjuez and Badajoz, and also by the expression and cast of
features marked in many of the peasants of the south-west of Ireland, which
strikingly resemble those of the children of Spain.

There is also another subject of antiquity in Ireland, and closely
connected with her early history, of the true origin of which the world
seems much in ignorance, viz. her Round Towers. Possibly some of your able
correspondents will kindly supply some information on one or both of these
subjects.

THE FAMILY OF THE TRADESCANTS.

(Vol. ii., pp. 119. 286.)

The family of the Tradescants is involved in considerable obscurity, and
the period of the arrival of the first of that name in England is not, for
a certainty, known. There were, it seems, three of the Tradescants at one
time in this country--grandfather, father, and son. John Tradescant (or
Tradeskin, as he was generally called by his contemporaries) the elder was,
according to Anthony Wood, a Fleming or a Dutchman. He probably came to
England about the latter end of the reign of Elizabeth, or in the beginning
of that of James the First. He is reported to have been a great traveller,
and to have previously visited Barbary, Greece, Egypt, and other Eastern
countries. Upon his first arrival here he is said to have been successively
gardener to the Lord Treasurer Salisbury, Lord Weston, the Duke of
Buckingham, and other noblemen of distinction. In these situations he
remained until the office of royal gardener was bestowed upon him in 1629.

To John Tradescant the elder, posterity is mainly indebted for the
introduction of botany in this kingdom. "He, by great industry, made it
manifest that there is scarcely any plant existing in the known world, that
will not, with proper care, thrive in our climate." In a visit made by Sir
W. Watson and Dr. Mitchell to Tradescant's garden in 1749, an account of
which is inserted in the _Philosophical Transactions_, vol. xlvi. p. 160.,
it appears that it had been many years totally neglected, and the house
belonging to it empty and ruined; but though the garden was quite covered
with weeds, there remained among them manifest footsteps of its founder.
They found there the _Borago latifolia sempervivens_ of Caspar Bauhine;
_Polygonatum vulgare latifolium_, C.B.; _Aristolochia clematitis recta_,
C.B.; and the _Dracontium_ of Dodoens. There were then remaining two trees
of the _Arbutus_, which from their being so long used to our winters, did
not suffer from the severe cold of 1739-40, when most of their kind were
killed in England. In the orchard there was a tree of the _Rhamnus
catharticus_, about twenty feet high, and nearly a foot in diameter. There
are at present no traces of this garden remaining.

In the Ashmolean Library is preserved (No. 1461.) a folio manuscript
(probably in the handwriting of the elder Tradescant) which purports to be
"The Tradescants' Orchard, illustrated in sixty-five coloured drawings of
fruits, exhibiting various kinds of the apple, cherry, damson, date, {354}
gooseberry, peares, peaches, plums, nectarines, grape, Hasell-nutt, quince,
strawberry, with the times of their ripening."

Old John Tradescant died in the year 1652, at which period he was probably
far advanced in years, leaving behind him a son (also of the same name) who
seems to have inherited his father's talents and enthusiasm. There is a
tradition that John Tradescant the younger entered himself on board a
privateer going against the Algerines, that he might have an opportunity of
bringing apricot-trees from that country. He is known to have taken a
voyage to Virginia, whence he returned with many new plants. The two
Tradescants were the means of introducing a variety of curious species into
this kingdom, several of which bore their name. Tradescants' _Spiderwort_
and _Aster_ are well known to this day, and Linnaeus has immortalised them
among the botanists by making a new genus under their names of the
_Spiderwort_, which had been before called _Ephemeron_.

When the elder Tradescant first settled in England, he formed a curious
collection of natural history, coins, medals, and a great variety of
"uncommon rarities." A catalogue of them was published in 12mo. in the year
1656, by his son, under the name of _Museum Tradescantianum_; to which are
prefixed portraits, both of the father and son, by Hollar. This Museum or
"Ark," as it was termed, was frequently visited by persons of rank, who
became benefactors thereto; among these were Charles the First, Henrietta
Maria (his queen), Archbishop Laud, George Duke of Buckingham, Robert and
William Cecil, Earls of Salisbury, and many other persons of distinction:
among them also appears the philosophic John Evelyn, who in his _Diary_ has
the following notice:

    "Sept. 17, 1657, I went to see Sir Robert Needham, at Lambeth, a
    relation of mine, and thence to John Tradescant's museum."

 "Thus John Tradeskin starves our wondering eyes
  By boxing up his new-found rarities."

Ashmole, in his _Diary_ (first published by Charles Burman in 1717), has
three significant entries relating to the subject of our notice, which I
transcribe _verbatim_:

    "Decem. 12, 1659. Mr. Tredescant and his wife told me they had been
    long considering upon whom to bestow their closet of curiosities when
    they died, and at last had resolved to give it unto me.

    "April 22, 1662. Mr. John Tredescant died.

    "May 30, 1662. This Easter term I preferred a bill in Chancery against
    Mrs. Tredescant, for the rarities her husband had settled on me."

The success of Ashmole's suit is well known; but the whole transaction
reflects anything but honour upon his name. The loss of her husband's
treasures probably preyed upon the mind of Mrs. Tradescant; for in the
_Diary_ before quoted, under April 4, 1678, Ashmole says:

    "My wife told me that Mrs. Tradescant was found drowned in her pond.
    She was drowned the day before at noon, as appears by some
    circumstance."

This was the same Hesther Tradescant who erected the Tradescant monument in
Lambeth churchyard. She was buried in the vault where her husband and his
son John (who "died in his spring") had been formerly laid.

The table monument to the memory of the Tradescants was erected in 1662.
The sculptures on the four sides are as follows, viz. on the _north_, a
crocodile, shells, &c., and a view of some Egyptian buildings; on the
_south_, broken columns, Corinthian capitals, &c., supposed to be ruins in
Greece, or some Eastern country; on the _east_, Tradescant's arms, on a
bend three fleurs-de-lys, impaling a lion passant; on the _west_, a hydra,
and under it a skull; various figures of trees, &c., in relievo, adorn the
four corners of the tomb; over it is placed a handsome tablet of black
marble. The monument, by the contribution of some friends to their memory,
was in the year 1773 repaired, and (according to Sir John Hawkins) the
following lines, "_formerly_ intended for an epitaph, inserted thereon."
Other authorities say that they were merely _restored_.

 "Know, stranger, ere thou pass beneath this stone,
  Lye John Tradescant, grandsire, father, son;
  The last dy'd in his spring; the other two
  Liv'd till they had travell'd Art and Nature through,
  As by their choice collections may appear,
  Of what is rare, in land, in sea, in air;
  Whilst they (as Homer's _Iliad_ in a nut)
  A world of wonders in one closet shut;
  These famous antiquarians that had been
  _Both Gardeners to the Rose and Lily Queen_,
  Transplanted now themselves, sleep here; and when
  Angels shall with their trumpets waken men,
  And fire shall purge the world, these hence shall rise,
  And change this garden for a Paradise."

A number of important errors concerning this once celebrated family have
been made by different writers. Sir John Hawkins, in a note to his edition
of Walton's _Angler_ (edit. 1792, p. 24.), says:

    "There were, it seems, three of the Tradescants, grandfather, father,
    and son: the son is the person here meant: the two former were
    gardeners to Queen Elizabeth, and the latter to King Charles I."

The epitaph above quoted satisfactorily proves, I think, that the
Tradescants were never gardeners to the maiden Queen. "The rose and lily
queen" was certainly Henrietta Maria, the queen of Charles the First. I
have now before me (from the cabinet of a friend) a small silver medal
struck to commemorate the marriage of Charles the First. It has on the
obverse the busts of Charles and Henrietta, the sun shining from the clouds
above {355} them: the inscription is CH: MAG: ET: HEN: MA: BRIT: REX: ET:
REG. The reverse contains in the field, Cupid mixing _lilies with roses_;
the legend being FVNDIT: AMOR: LILIA: MIXTA: ROSIS. In the exergue is the
date 1625. The Tradescant mentioned by Walton in 1653 was the _second_ of
that name, not the son, as stated by Sir John Hawkins.

The editor of the last edition of Evelyn's _Diary_ (vol. ii. p. 414.) says,
speaking of the Tradescants:

    "They were all eminent gardeners, travellers, and collectors of
    curiosities. The two first came into this country in the reign of James
    I., and the second and third were employed in the Royal Gardens by
    Charles I."

Here is a _positive_ statement that the elder Tradescant and his son came
into England in the reign of _James I._ But there is no _proof_ of this
given. It is merely the writer's assertion. At the end of the same note,
speaking of Tradescant's Ark, the editor observes:

    "It formed the foundation of the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford, and a
    catalogue of its contents was printed by the youngest John Tradescant
    in 1656, with the title of _Museum Tradescantianum_. He died in 1652."

It was not the _youngest_ John Tradescant that died in 1652, but the
_oldest_, the _grandfather_--the first of that name that settled in
England.

The following is a list of the portraits of the Tradescant family now in
the Ashmolean Museum; both father and son are in these portraits called
_Sir_ John, though it does not appear that either of them was ever
knighted. Mr. Black, in his excellent catalogue of the Ashmolean Library,
also calls the elder Tradescant _Sir_ John. (See p. 1266.)

1. Sir John Tradescant, sen., three-quarter size, ornamented with fruit,
flowers, and garden roots.

2. The same, after his decease.

3. The same, a small three-quarter piece, in water colours.

4. A large painting of his wife, son, and daughter, quarter-length.

5. Sir John Tradescant, junior, in his garden, with a spade in his hand,
half-length.

6. The same with his wife, half-length.

7. The same, with his friend Zythepsa of Lambeth, a collection of shells,
&c. upon a table before them.

8. A large quarter piece inscribed Sir John Tradescant's second wife and
son.

Granger says he saw a picture at a gentleman's house in Wiltshire, which
was not unlike that of the deceased Tradescant, and the inscription was
applicable to it:

 "Mortuus haud alio quam quo pater ore quiesti,
  Quam facili frueris nunc quoque nocte doces."

I may add, in conclusion, that several beautiful drawings of the Tradescant
monument in Lambeth churchyard are preserved in the Pepysian library. These
drawings were engraved for the _Philosophical Transactions_, vol. lxiii. p.
88.; and are printed from the same plates in the _Bibliotheca Topographica
Britannica_, vol. ii.

MEANING OF VENVILLE.

(Vol. iii., pp. 152. 310.)

I observe, in p. 310. of the present volume, that two correspondents, P.
and K., have contributed conjectures as to the meaning and origin of the
term _venville_, noticed and explained _ante_, p. 152. The _origin_ of the
word is of course to some extent open to conjecture; but they may rest
assured that the _meaning_ of it is not, nor ever has been, within the
domain of mere conjecture with those who have had any opportunities of
inquiry in the proper quarter. The term has not the slightest reference to
the ceremony of delivering possession, which P. has evidently witnessed in
the case of his father, and which lawyers call livery of seisin; nor is
there on Dartmoor any such word as _ven_ signifying peat, or as _fail_,
signifying turf. No doubt a fen on the moor would probably contain "black
earth or peat," like most other mountain bogs; and if (as K. says) _fail_
means a "turf or flat clod" in Scotland, I think it probable that a
Scotchman on Dartmoor might now and then so far forget himself as to call
peat or turf by a name which would certainly not be understood by an
aboriginal Devonian. The local name of the peat or other turf cut for fuel
is _vaggs_, and this has perhaps been confounded in the recollection of
K.'s informant with _ven_. At all events, I can assure both P. and K. (who,
I presume, are not familiar with the district) that the tenants of venville
lands have no functions to perform, as such, in any degree connected with
either turf-cutting, or "fenging fields," and that they do not necessarily,
or generally, occupy peat districts, or rejoice in

 "All the infections that the sun sucks up
  From bogs, fens, flats," &c.;

but, on the contrary, they are the owners of some of the most valuable,
salubrious, and picturesque purlieus of the forest. With regard to the name
"fengfield," although I am pretty familiar with the records of the forest
extant for the last five hundred years past, I do not remember that it is
ever so named or spelt in the muniments of the manor or forest. It is so
written by Risdon, and in some few other documents entitled to little
weight, and from which no safe inference can be drawn. Whatever be the
etymological origin of the term, it should be assumed as indisputable by
any one who may hereafter exercise his ingenuity or his fancy upon it, that
the four most prominent {356} incidents to the tenure are--1. payment of
fines; 2. situation in an ancient vill; 3. attendance on the lord's court;
4. enjoyment of certain rights of common. It may be that neither the _fine_
nor the _vill_ forms a component part of the name; but K. need have no
scruple in believing that an abbreviated Latin or "legal term" (invented,
of course, by the stewards or bailiffs of the lord) may have become
naturalised among those of the inhabitants of the Moor whom it concerns.
The tenants or retainers of a manor have no alternative but to submit to
any generic name by which the steward may please to distinguish them. Thus
the "priors" and "censors" of Dartmoor forest are content to be called by
those names, because they were designated as "prehurdarii" and "censarii"
in the court rolls some hundred years ago. The tenants of a certain
lordship in Cornwall know and convey their tenements by the name of
_landams_ to this day, merely because the stewards two hundred years ago,
when the court rolls were in Latin, well knowing that _landa_ was the Latin
for _land_, and that transitive verbs in that language require an
accusative case, recorded each tenant as having taken of the lord "unam
landam, vocatam Tregollup," &c. Indeed so easily does a clipt exotic take
root and become acclimated among the peasantry of the Moor, whose powers of
appropriation are so much disparaged by the sceptical doubts of K., that
since the establishment of local courts the terms _fifa_ and _casa_ have
become familiar to them as household words and the name and uses of that
article of abbreviated Latinity called a '_bus_ are, as I am credibly
informed, not unknown to them.

_Mind your P's and Q's_ (Vol. iii., p. 328.)--This expression arose from
the ancient custom of hanging a slate behind the alehouse door, on which
was written P. or Q. (i. e. _Pint_ or _Quart_) against the name of each
customer, according to the quantity which he had drunk, and which was not
expected to be paid for till the Saturday evening, when the wages were
settled.

The expression so familiar to schoolboys of "_going tick_," may perhaps be
traced to this, a _tick_ or mark being put for every glass of ale.

C. DE LA PRYME.

_The Sempecta at Croyland_ (Vol. iii., p. 328.).--He was not there,
however; and I am sorry to say, I do not remember where he was personally,
or exactly where the account of him is to be found. I have no doubt of its
being in one or other of the fourteen volumes of Martene's _Thesaurus et
Amplissima Collectio_. I do not now possess those books, and have not
access to them; but I think your correspondent will find what he wants
without much difficulty if (as I suspect) it is with some other pieces in
rhyme, and therefore likely to catch the eye in turning over a volume
chiefly in prose. Perhaps the name "Francis" may be in the index. If he
does not, I shall be happy to seek for information.

_Solid-hoofed Pigs_ (Vol. iii., p. 263.).--I saw a pig of this kind a few
years ago, in possession of Sir William Homan, Bart., of Dromroe, near
Cappoquin, in the county of Waterford.

I do not know whether he has any of that breed at present; but have little
doubt that a note, addressed to Sir William on the subject, would receive a
courteous reply.

H. C.

Thurles, April 9. 1851.

_Porci solide-pedes_ (Vol. iii., p. 263.).--A correspondent of "NOTES AND
QUERIES" inquires about the breed of solid-hoofed pigs. Some years, perhaps
twenty years, ago there were several pigs of that sort in the possession of
Robert Ramsden, Esq., of Coulton Hall, Notts, of which he was good enough
to give some to my father. I believe they were considered of Chinese
origins, but how remotely I do not know. They were very easily fattened,
but always of small size; and I think, unless my memory much deceives me,
on removing the horny portion of the hoof, the rudiments of a cloven hoof,
like that of the ordinary swine, were to be seen.

Blackheath, April 17. 1851.

_Sir Henry Slingsby's Diary_ (Vol. iii., p. 323.).--The council of "THE
CAMDEN SOCIETY" will no doubt be pleased to find that your correspondents
are good enough to keep in view the welfare of that Society, and to suggest
works suitable for their publication.

If Sir Henry Slingsby's _Diary_ had never been published, it would indeed
have been an excellent book for the Camden Society; but be kind enough to
inform your correspondent P. B. that, besides some quotations printed in
Seward's _Anecdotes_, and large extracts published at Edinburgh, in an
octavo volume, in 1806, the whole _Diary_, with a great deal of
illustrative matter relating to the Slingsby family, was published in one
volume, 8vo., London, 1836, under the very competent editorship of the Rev.
Daniel Parsons, of Oriel College, Oxford.

It appears from the preface to that publication, that the original MS. is
not now known to be in existence. Mr. Parsons printed from a copy of the
original, made by Sir Savile Slingsby, in 1714-5, which then remained at
Scriven.

ETTIE.

_Criston, Somerset_ (Vol. iii., p. 278.).--Perhaps PRISTON is the place
inquired for. This is a village near Keynshem, where a Mr. _Vaughan_
Jenkins has some property. _Criston_, as a place in Somerset, is unknown to

J.

Bath, April 18.

_Criston_ (Vol. iii., p. 278.).--There is a small village in Somersetshire
called Christon, about five miles N.W. of Axbridge.

C. I. R.

_Tradesmen's Signs_ (Vol. iii., p. 224.).--In the delightful little volume
on Chaucer, in Knight's shilling series, entitled _Pictures of English
Life_, the author has the following on the Tabard, at p. 19.:--

    "The sign and its supports were removed in 1776, when all such
    characteristic features of the streets of London in the olden time,
    disappeared _in obedience to a parliamentary edict_ for their
    destruction."

It would appear, however, by the subsequent quotation from Brand's
_Antiquities_, vol. ii. p. 359., that the edict above referred to was not
carried into execution against all signs; or that, if so, it was soon
repealed:--

    "Lord Thurlow, in his speech for postponing the further reading of the
    Surgeons' Incorporation Bill, July 17th, 1797, stated 'that by a
    statute still in force, the barbers and surgeons were each to use a
    pole.'"

R. W. E.

Cor. Chr. Coll., Cambridge.

_Emendation of a Passage in Virgil_ (Vol. iii., p. 237.).--The emendation
of SCRIBLERUS is certainly objectionable, and by no means satisfactory, for
these reasons:--1st. "Ac sunt in spatio" is by no means elegant Latin,
which "addunt se in spatia" is; for the word "addunt" is constantly used in
the same way elsewhere.

2nd. The word "spatium" is seldom used to signify a chariot course.

"Spatia," the plural, was the proper expression, and is only so deviated
from in poetry in a single instance. (Juv. _Sat._ vi. 582.) It is used in
{358} the plural in Virg. _AEn_. v. 316. 325. 327.; Statius, _Theb._ vi.
594.; Horace, _Epist._ 1. xiv. 9.

_Vide_ Smith's _Dictionary of Antiquities_, under art. Circus, p. 232.

Surely there is nothing unintelligible in the expression, "addunt se in
spatia," which is the reading given in almost all the best editions.

NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.

Archdeacon Cotton, whose endeavours to ascertain and record the succession
of the Prelates and Members of the Cathedral Bodies in Ireland are probably
known to many of our readers (at least, by the Queries which have appeared
in our Columns), has just completed his _Fasti Ecclesiae Hiberniae_, in 4
vols. 8vo. From the nature of the work, it is obvious that it could never
have been undertaken with a view to profit. The printing, &c., has cost
upwards of six hundred pounds, and the Archdeacon, naturally unwilling to
lose the whole of this outlay, is circulating a prospectus offering copies
at fifty shillings the set. Of these, there are but two hundred. The
utility of a book which contains the names and preferments of every
occupant of an Irish see, dignity, or prebend, from the earliest period to
the present day, so far as existing materials permits, is so obvious, that
it can scarcely be doubted that it must eventually find a place in all
public and official libraries.

NOTICES TO CORRESPONDENTS.

OUR PROGRESS IN THE COLONIES. _We cannot resist bringing before our readers
the following passage from a letter which accompanied some very interesting
communications from_ ADELAIDE, SOUTH AUSTRALIA, _received by us this
week_:--

"_A lover and a student of all that is interesting or curious in literary
antiquity_, _my position necessarily debars me from all access to original
manuscripts_, _and to such volumes as are only to be found in large public
libraries_; _and also keeps me in ignorance of much that is going on in the
literary world_. _Thus there is a blank in the course of my favourite study
which is well filled up by your excellent and interesting periodical_. _It
is indeed a great boon to all situated as I am at a distance from the
fountain head of antiquarian knowledge._"

_Such an acknowledgment of our utility to our brethren abroad_, _is most
gratifying to us_. _We trust those of our readers who have friends and
relatives who are fond of literary pursuits_, _resident in the colonies_,
_will do them and us the kindness of directing their attention to_ "NOTES
AND QUERIES."

V. _is requested to say how we can address a letter to him_.

W. P. A. The Catalogue of Sir T. Phillip's MSS. _is privately printed_.
_There are copies_, _we believe_, _at the Bodleian_, _the Athenaeum_, _and
the Society of Antiquaries._

E. B. P. _Correct in this supposition._

W. A. _The Camden Society could not undertake the publication of the
proposed_ Monumentarium Anglicanum, _without neglecting the objects for
which it was more immediately instituted_.

D. K.'s _Query was in type before we received his reminder_. _We do not
acknowledge the receipt of Queries_, _from an anxiety not to occupy space
unnecessarily_.

C. W. _and_ B. W. E. _are both thanked for the friendly tone of their
communications_.

X. Y. Z. HALLAM'S LITERATURE OF EUROPE. _The supplemental notes on the_
Literature of Europe _have not yet been incorporated in any edition of that
work_. _They form a separate volume adapted to all the existing editions._

MONUMENTARIUM ANGLICANUM. _We continue to receive valuable communications
upon this subject_, _which we shall take an early opportunity of bringing
before our Readers._

DE H. _A private communication awaits this correspondent_. _Will he furnish
us with his address?_

_Among many communications which we are this week obliged to postpone for
want of room_, _we may mention_ MR. PETER CUNNINGHAM'S _Reply to_ MR. FOSS
_on the_ Outer Temple--_An interesting paper on_ The Lay of The Last
Minstrel, _and many Replies_.

_price_ 9s. 6d. _each_.

NOTES AND QUERIES _may be procured_, _by order_, _of all Booksellers and
Newsvenders_. _It is published at noon on Friday_, _so that our country
Subscribers ought not to experience any difficulty in procuring it
regularly_. _Many of the country Booksellers_, _&c_., _are_, _probably_,
_not yet aware of this arrangement_, _which will enable them to receive_
NOTES AND QUERIES _in their Saturday parcels_.

_All communications for the Editor of_ NOTES AND QUERIES _should be
addressed to the care of_ MR. BELL, No. 186. Fleet Street.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
