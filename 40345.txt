                                  NOTE


_A Song of the Guns_ was written under what are probably the most
remarkable conditions in which a poem has ever been composed.  The
author, who is now serving in Flanders, was present at the battle of
Loos, and during a lull in the fighting--when the gunners, who had been
sleepless for five nights, were resting like tired dogs under their
guns--he jotted down the main theme of the poem.  After the battle the
artillery brigade to which he was attached was ordered to Ypres, and it
was during the long trench warfare in this district, within sight of the
ruined tower of Ypres Cathedral, that the poem was finally completed.
The last three stanzas were written at midnight in Brigade Headquarters
with the German shells screaming over into the ruined town.

                           A SONG OF THE GUNS


    These are our masters, the slim
      Grim muzzles that irk in the pit;
    That chafe for the rushing of wheels,
      For the teams plunging madly to bit
    As the gunners wing down to unkey,
      For the trails sweeping half-circle-right,
    For the six breech-blocks clashing as one
      To a target viewed clear on the sight--
    Gray masses the shells search and tear
      Into fragments that bunch as they run--
    For the hour of the red battle-harvest,
      The dream of the slaves of the gun!

    We have bartered our souls to the guns;
      Every fibre of body and brain
    Have we trained to them, chained to them.  Serfs?
      Aye! but proud of the weight of our chain,
    Of our backs that are bowed to their workings,
      To hide them and guard and disguise,
    Of our ears that are deafened with service,
      Of hands that are scarred, and of eyes
    Grown hawklike with marking their prey,
      Of wings that are slashed as with swords
    When we hover, the turn of a blade
      From the death that is sweet to our lords.




                        THE VOICE OF THE SLAVES


    _By the ears and the eyes and the brain,_
      _By the limbs and the hands and the wings,_
    _We are slaves to our masters the guns;_
      _But their slaves are the masters of kings!_




                              HEADQUARTERS


    A league and a league from the trenches,
      from the traversed maze of the lines,--
    Where daylong the sniper watches and daylong the
      bullet whines,
    And the cratered earth is in travail with mines and
      with countermines,--

    Here, where haply some woman dreamed, (are
      those her roses that bloom
    In the garden beyond the windows of my littered
      working-room?)
    We have decked the map for our masters as a bride
      is decked for the groom.

    Here, on each numbered lettered square,--cross-road
      and mound and wire,
    Loophole, redoubt, and emplacement, are the targets
      their mouths desire,--
    Gay with purples and browns and blues, have we
      traced them their arcs of fire.

    And ever the type-keys clatter; and ever our keen
      wires bring
    Word from the watchers a-crouch below, word
      from the watchers a-wing;
    And ever we hear the distant growl of our hid guns
      thundering;

    Hear it hardly, and turn again to our maps, where
      the trench-lines crawl,
    Red on the gray and each with a sign for the
      ranging shrapnel's fall--
    Snakes that our masters shall scotch at dawn, as is
      written here on the wall.

    For the weeks of our waiting draw to a close....
      There is scarcely a leaf astir
    In the garden beyond my windows where the
      twilight shadows blur
    The blaze of some woman's roses....
        "Bombardment orders, sir."




                               GUN-TEAMS


    Their rugs are sodden, their heads are down, their
        tails are turned to the storm.
      (Would you know them, you that groomed them
        in the sleek fat days of peace,--
    When the tiles rang to their pawings in the lighted
        stalls and warm,--
      Now the foul clay cakes on breeching-strap and
        clogs the quick-release?)

    The blown rain stings, there is never a star, the
        tracks are rivers of slime.
      (You must harness up by guesswork with a
        failing torch for light,
    Instep-deep in unmade standings, for it's active-service time,
      And our resting weeks are over, and we move
        the guns to-night.)

    The iron tires slither, the traces sag; their blind
        hooves stumble and slide;
      They are war-worn, they are weary, soaked with
        sweat and sopped with rain.
    (You must hold them, you must help them, swing
        your lead and centre wide
      Where the greasy granite pave peters out to
        squelching drain.)

    There is shrapnel bursting a mile in front on the
        road that the guns must take:
      (You are nervous, you are thoughtful, you are
        shifting in your seat,
    As you watch the ragged feathers flicker orange
        flame and break)--
      But the teams are pulling steady down the
        battered village street.

    You have shod them cold, and their coats are long,
        and their bellies gray with the mud;
      They have done with gloss and polish, but the
        fighting heart's unbroke.
    We, who saw them hobbling after us down white
        roads flecked with blood,
      Patient, wondering why we left them, till we
        lost them in the smoke;

    Who have felt them shiver between our knees,
        when the shells rain black from the skies,
      When the bursting terrors find us and the lines
        stampede as one;
    Who have watched the pierced limbs quiver and
        the pain in stricken eyes,
      Know the worth of humble servants, foolish-faithful
        to their gun!




                            EYES IN THE AIR


    Our guns are a league behind us, our target a mile below,
    And there's never a cloud to blind us from the haunts of
      our lurking foe--
    Sunk pit whence his shrapnel tore us, support-trench
            crest-concealed,
    As clear as the charts before us, his ramparts lie revealed.
    His panicked watchers spy us, a droning threat in the void;
    Their whistling shells outfly us--puff upon puff, deployed
    Across the green beneath us, across the flanking grey,
    In fume and fire to sheathe us and balk us of our prey.

    Below, beyond, above her,
      Their iron web is spun!
    Flicked but unsnared we hover,
      Edged planes against the sun:
    Eyes in the air above his lair,
      The hawks that guide the gun!

    No word from earth may reach us save, white against the ground,
    The strips outspread to teach us whose ears are deaf to sound:
    But down the winds that sear us, athwart our engine's shriek,
    We send--and know they hear us, the ranging guns we speak.
    Our visored eyeballs show us their answering pennant, broke
    Eight thousand feet below us, a whirl of flame-stabbed smoke--
    The burst that hangs to guide us, while numbed gloved fingers
            tap
    From wireless key beside us the circles of the map.

    Line--target--short or over--
      Comes, plain as clock-hands run,
    Word from the birds that hover,
      Unblinded, tail to sun--
    Word out of air to range them fair,
      From hawks that guide the gun!

    Your flying shells have failed you, your landward guns are dumb:
    Since earth hath naught availed you, these skies be open!  Come,
    Where, wild to meet and mate you, flame in their beaks for
            breath,
    Black doves! the white hawks wait you on the wind-tossed
      boughs of death.
    These boughs be cold without you, our hearts are hot for this,
    Our wings shall beat about you, our scorching breath shall kiss:
    Till, fraught with that we gave you, fulfilled of our desire,
    You bank,--too late to save you from biting beaks of fire,--

    Turn sideways from your lover,
      Shudder and swerve and run,
    Tilt; stagger; and plunge over
      Ablaze against the sun,--
    Doves dead in air, who clomb to dare
      The hawks that guide the gun!




                                SIGNALS


      The hot wax drips from the flares
      On the scrawled pink forms that litter
      The bench where he sits; the glitter
    Of stars is framed by the sandbags atop of the dug-out stairs.
      And the lagging watch-hands creep;
      And his cloaked mates murmur in sleep,--
      Forms he can wake with a kick,--
    And he hears, as he plays with the pressel-switch, the strapped
        receiver click
      On his ear that listens, listens;
      And the candle-flicker glistens
    On the rounded brass of the switch-board where the red wires
        cluster thick.

      Wires from the earth, from the air;
      Wires that whisper and chatter
      At night, when the trench-rats patter
    And nibble among the rations and scuttle back to their lair;
      Wires that are never at rest,--
      For the linesmen tap them and test,
      And ever they tremble with tone:--
    And he knows from a hundred signals the buzzing call of his own,
      The breaks and the vibrant stresses,--
      The Z and the G and the S's
    That call his hand to the answering key and his mouth to the
        microphone.

      For always the laid guns fret
      On the words that his mouth shall utter,
      When rifle and Maxim stutter
    And the rockets volley to starward from the spurting parapet;
      And always his ear must hark
      To the voices out of the dark,--
      For the whisper over the wire,
    From the bombed and the battered trenches where the wounded moan
        in the mire,--
      For a sign to waken the thunder
      Which shatters the night in sunder
    With the flash of the leaping muzzles and the beat of
            battery-fire.




                             THE OBSERVERS


    Ere the last light that leaps the night has hung and shone and
            died,
      While yet the breast-high fog of dawn is swathed about the
              plain,
    By hedge and track our slaves go back, the waning stars for
            guide,
      Eyes of our mouths; the mists have cleared, the guns would
              speak again!

    Faint on the ears that strain to hear, their orders trickle down
      "Degrees--twelve--left of zero line--corrector one three
              eight--
    Three thousand." ... Shift our trails and lift the muzzles that
        shall drown
      The rifle's idle chatter when our sendings detonate.

    Sending or still, these serve our will; the hidden eyes that
            mark
      From gutted farm, from laddered tree that scans the furrowed
              slope,
    From coigns of slag whose pit-ropes sag on burrowed ways and
            dark,
      In open trench where sandbags hold the steady periscope.

    Waking, they know the instant foe, the bullets phutting by,
      The blurring lens, the sodden map, the wires that leak or
              break!
    Sleeping, they dream of shells that scream adown a sunless sky--
      And the splinters patter round them in their dug-outs as they
              wake.

    Not theirs, the wet glad bayonet, the red and racing hour,
      The rush that clears the bombing-post with knife and
              hand-grenade;
    Not theirs the zest when, steel to breast, the last survivors
            cower,--
      Yet can ye hold the ground ye won, save these be there to aid?

    These, that observe the shell's far swerve, these of the quiet
            voice,
      That bids "go on," repeats the range, corrects for fuse or
              line...
    Though dour the task their masters ask, what room for thought or
            choice?
      This is ours by right of service, heedless gift of youthful
              eyne!

    Careless they give while yet they live; the dead we tasked too
            sore
      Bear witness we were naught begrudged of riches or of youth;
    Careless they gave; across their grave our calling salvoes roar,
      And those we maimed come back to us in proof our dead speak
              truth!




                           AMMUNITION COLUMN


    _I am only a cog in a giant machine, a link of an endless
            chain:--_
    _And the rounds are drawn, and the rounds are fired,_
      _and the empties return again;_
    _'Railroad, lorry, and limber; battery, column, and park;_
    _'To the shelf where the set fuse waits the breech, from_
      _the quay where the shells embark._
    We have watered and fed, and eaten our beef; the
      long dull day drags by,
    As I sit here watching our "Archibalds" _strafing_ an empty sky;
    Puff and flash on the far-off blue round the speck
      one guesses the plane--
    Smoke and spark of the gun-machine that is fed by the endless
            chain.

    I am only a cog in a giant machine, a little link in the chain,
    Waiting a word from the wagon-lines that the guns are hungry
            again:--
    _Column-wagon to battery-wagon, and battery-wagon to gun;_
    _To the loader kneeling 'twixt trail and wheel from the_
      _shops where the steam-lathes run._
    There's a lone mule braying against the line where
      the mud cakes fetlock-deep!
    There's a lone soul humming a hint of a song in
      the barn where the drivers sleep;
    And I hear the pash of the orderly's horse as he
      canters him down the lane--
    Another cog in the gun-machine, a link in the selfsame chain.

    I am only a cog in a giant machine, but a vital link in the
            chain;
    And the Captain has sent from the wagon-line to
      fill his wagons again;--
    _From wagon-limber to gunpit dump; from loader's forearm at
            breech_
    _To the working party that melts away when the shrapnel_
      _bullets screech.--_
    So the restless section pulls out once more in column
      of route from the right,
    At the tail of a blood-red afternoon; so the flux of another
            night
    Bears back the wagons we fill at dawn to the sleeping column
            again...
    Cog on cog in the gun-machine, link on link in the chain!




                         THE VOICE OF THE GUNS


    We are the guns, and your masters!  Saw ye our flashes?
    Heard ye the scream of our shells in the night, and the
      shuddering crashes?
    Saw ye our work by the roadside, the gray wounded lying,
    Moaning to God that he made them--the maimed and the dying?
        Husbands or sons,
    Fathers or lovers, we break them!  We are the guns!

    We are the guns and ye serve us!  Dare ye grow weary,
    Steadfast at nighttime, at noontime; or waking, when dawn
      winds blow dreary
    Over the fields and the flats and the reeds of the barrier
            water,
    To wait on the hour of our choosing, the minute decided for
            slaughter?
        Swift the clock runs;
    Yes, to the ultimate second.  Stand to your guns!

    We are the guns and we need you!  Here in the timbered
    Pits that are screened by the crest and the copse
      where at dusk ye unlimbered,
    Pits that one found us--and, finding, gave life (did
      he flinch from the giving?);
    Laboured by moonlight when wraith of the dead
      brooded yet o'er the living,
        Ere with the sun's
    Rising the sorrowful spirit abandoned its guns.

    Who but the guns shall avenge him?  Strip us for action!
    Load us and lay to the centremost hair of the dial-sight's
            refraction.
    Set your quick hands to our levers to compass the sped soul's
            assoiling;
    Brace your taut limbs to the shock when the thrust
      of the barrel recoiling
        Deafens and stuns!
    Vengeance is ours for our servants.  Trust ye the guns!

    Least of our bond-slaves or greatest, grudge ye the burden?
    Hard is this service of ours which has only our service for
            guerdon:
    Grow the limbs lax, and unsteady the hands, which
      aforetime we trusted;
    Flawed, the clear crystal of sight; and the clean
      steel of hardihood rusted?
        _Dominant ones,_
    _Are we not tried serfs and proven--true to our guns?_

    _Ye are the guns!  Are we worthy?  Shall not these speak for
            us,_
    _Out of the woods where the torn trees are slashed with_
      _the vain bolts that seek for us,_
    _Thunder of batteries firing in unison, swish of shell
            flighting,_
    _Hissing that rushes to silence and breaks to the thud of
            alighting?_
        _Death that outruns_
    _Horseman and foot?  Are we justified?  Answer, O guns!_

    Yea! by your works are ye justified,--toil unrelieved;
    Manifold labours, cooerdinate each to the sending achieved;
    Discipline, not of the feet but the soul, unremitting,
            unfeigned;
    Tortures unholy by flame and by maiming, known, faced, and
            disdained;
      Courage that shuns
    Only foolhardiness;--even by these are ye worthy your guns!

    Wherefore--and unto ye only--power has been given;
    Yea! beyond man, over men, over desolate cities and riven;
    Yea! beyond space, over earth and the seas and the
      sky's high dominions;
    Yea! beyond time, over Hell and the fiends and
      the Death-Angel's pinions!
        Vigilant ones,
    Loose them, and shatter, and spare not.  We are the guns!

General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to copying and
distributing Project Gutenberg(tm) electronic works to protect the

_Please read this before you distribute or use this work._

To protect the Project Gutenberg(tm) mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work (or
any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg(tm) License available with this file or online at
http://www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1. General Terms of Use & Redistributing Project Gutenberg(tm)
electronic works


*1.A.* By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg(tm)
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all the
terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy all
copies of Project Gutenberg(tm) electronic works in your possession. If
you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg(tm) electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

*1.B.* "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few things
that you can do with most Project Gutenberg(tm) electronic works even
without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See paragraph
1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg(tm) electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg(tm) electronic
works. See paragraph 1.E below.

*1.C.* The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

Project Gutenberg(tm) electronic works. Nearly all the individual works
in the collection are in the public domain in the United States. If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you
from copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating
derivative works based on the work as long as all references to Project
Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope that you will support the
Project Gutenberg(tm) mission of promoting free access to electronic
works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg(tm) works in compliance with
the terms of this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg(tm) name
associated with the work. You can easily comply with the terms of this
agreement by keeping this work in the same format with its attached full
Project Gutenberg(tm) License when you share it without charge with
others.

*1.D.* The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg(tm) work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

*1.E.* Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

*1.E.1.* The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg(tm) License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg(tm) work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
    almost no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away
    or re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License
    included with this eBook or online at http://www.gutenberg.org

*1.E.2.* If an individual Project Gutenberg(tm) electronic work is
derived from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating
that it is posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can
be copied and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying
any fees or charges. If you are redistributing or providing access to a
work with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on
the work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs
1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg(tm) trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

*1.E.3.* If an individual Project Gutenberg(tm) electronic work is
posted with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and
distribution must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and
any additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg(tm) License for all works posted
with the permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of
this work.

Gutenberg(tm) License terms from this work, or any files containing a
part of this work or any other work associated with Project
Gutenberg(tm).

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with

Gutenberg(tm) License.

*1.E.6.* You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg(tm) work in a format other than

posted on the official Project Gutenberg(tm) web site
(http://www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or
expense to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a

"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include
the full Project Gutenberg(tm) License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

  - You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
    the use of Project Gutenberg(tm) works calculated using the method
    you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
    to the owner of the Project Gutenberg(tm) trademark, but he has
    agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
    Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
    within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
    legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
    payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
    Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
    Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
    Literary Archive Foundation."

  - You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
    you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
    does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg(tm)
    License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
    copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
    all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg(tm)
    works.

  - You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
    any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
    electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
    receipt of the work.

  - You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
    distribution of Project Gutenberg(tm) works.


*1.E.9.* If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg(tm) electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg(tm) trademark. Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3. below.

*1.F.*

*1.F.1.* Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg(tm) collection.
Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg(tm) electronic works, and the
medium on which they may be stored, may contain "Defects," such as, but
not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data, transcription
errors, a copyright or other intellectual property infringement, a
defective or damaged disk or other medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

*1.F.2.* LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg(tm) trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg(tm) electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal fees.
YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY,
BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE PROVIDED IN
PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE TRADEMARK OWNER, AND
ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES
EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

*1.F.3.* LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund. If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

*1.F.4.* Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

*1.F.5.* Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law. The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

*1.F.6.* INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg(tm) electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg(tm) electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg(tm)
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg(tm) work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg(tm)


Project Gutenberg(tm) is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg(tm)'s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg(tm) collection will remain
freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and
permanent future for Project Gutenberg(tm) and future generations. To
learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and
how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the
Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org .

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation


Project Gutenberg(tm) depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any
statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside
the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways
including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate,

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg(tm) electronic
works.


Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg(tm)
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg(tm) eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg(tm) eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless
a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks
in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's eBook
number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected _editions_ of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed.
_Versions_ based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg(tm),
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
