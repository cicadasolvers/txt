ENGLISH AND NORMAN SONGS OF THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY.

In a vellum book, known as _The Red Book of Ossory_, and preserved in the
archives of that see, is contained a collection of Latin religious poetry,
written in a good bold hand of the 14th century; prefixed to several of the
hymns, in a contemporary and identical hand, are sometimes one sometimes
more lines of a song in old English or Norman French, which as they occur I
here give:

 "Alas hou shold y syng, yloren is my playnge
  Hou sholdy wiz zat olde man}
                                  } swettist of al zinge."
  To leven and let my leman  }

       *       *       *       *       *

 "Harrow ieo su thy: p fol amo^r de mal amy."

       *       *       *       *       *

 "Have m^rcie on me frere: Barfote zat ygo."

       *       *       *       *       *

 "Do Do. nightyngale syng ful myrie
  Shal y nevre for zyn love lengre karie."

       *       *       *       *       *

 "Have God day me lemon," &c.

       *       *       *       *       *

 "Gaveth me no garlond of greene,
  Bot hit ben of Wythones yuroght."

       *       *       *       *       *

 "Do Do nyztyngale syng wel miry
  Shal y nevre for zyn love lengre kary."

       *       *       *       *       *

 "Hew alas p amo^r
  Oy moy myst en tant dolour."

       *       *       *       *       *

 "Hey how ze chevaldoures woke al nyght."

It is quite evident that these lines were thus prefixed (as is still the
custom), to indicate the _air_ to which the Latin hymns were to be sung.
This is also set forth in a memorandum at the commencement, which states
that these songs, _Cantilene_, were composed by the Bishop of Ossory for
the vicars of his cathedral church, and for his priests and clerks,

    "ne guttura eorum et ora deo sanctificata polluantur cantilenis
    teatralibus turpibus et secularibus: et cum sint cantatores, provideant
    sibi notis convenientibus, secundum quod dictamina requirunt."--_Lib.
    Rub. Ossor._ fol. 70.

We may, I think, safely conclude that the lines above given were the
commencement of the _cantilene teatrales turpes_ et _seculares_, which the
good bishop wished to deprive his clergy of all excuse for singing, by
providing them with pious hymns to the same airs; thinking, I suppose, like
John Wesley in after years, it was a pity the devil should monopolise all
the good tunes. I shall merely add that the author of the Latin poetry
seems to have been Richard de Ledrede, who filled {386} the see of Ossory
from 1318 to 1360, and was rendered famous by his proceedings against Dame
Alice Kyteller for heresy and witchcraft. (See a contemporary account of
the "proceedings" published by the Camden Society in 1843; a most valuable
contribution to Irish history, and well deserving of still more editorial
labour than has been bestowed on it.) I have copied the old English and
Norman-French word for word, preserving the contractions wherever they
occurred.

I shall conclude this "note" by proposing two "Queries:" to such of your
contributors as are learned in old English and French song-lore, viz.,

1. Are the entire songs, of which the above lines form the commencements,
known or recoverable?

2. If so, is the music to which they were sung handed down?

I shall feel much obliged by answers to both or either of the above
Queries, and

 "Bis dat, qui cito dat."

MISPLACED WORDS IN SHAKSPEARE'S TROILUS AND CRESSIDA.

In that immaculate volume, the first folio edition of Shakspeare, of which
Mr. Knight says: "Perhaps, all things considered, there never was a book so
correctly printed"! a passage in _Troilus and Cressida_, Act. v. Sc. 3.,
where Cassandra and Andromache are attempting to dissuade Hector from going
to battle, is thus given:

 "_And._ O be perswaded: doe not count it holy,
  To hurt by being iust; it is lawful:
  For we would count giue much to as violent thefts,
  And rob in the behalfe of charitie."

Deviating from his usual practice, Mr. Knight makes an omission and a
transposition, and reads thus:

                     "Do not count it holy
  To hurt by being just: it is as lawful,
  For we would give much, to count violent thefts,
  And rob in the behalf of charity."

with the following note; the ordinary reading is

 "'For we would give much _to use_ violent thefts.'"

_To use thefts_ is clearly not Shakspearian. Perhaps _count_ or _give_
might be omitted, supposing that one word had been substituted for another
in the manuscript, without the erasure of the first written; but this
omission will not give us a meaning. We have ventured to transpose _count_
and omit _as_:

 "For we would give much, to count violent thefts."

We have now a clear meaning: it is as lawful because we desire to give
much, to count violent thefts as _holy_, "and rob in the behalf of
charity."

Mr. Collier also lays aside his aversion to vary from the old copy, and
makes a bold innovation: he reads,--

                     "Do not count it holy
  To hurt by being just: it is as lawful,
  For us to give much count to violent thefts,
  And rob in the behalf of charity."

Thus giving his reasons: "This line [the third] is so corrupt in the folio
1623, as to afford no sense. The words and their arrangement are the same
in the second and third folio, while the fourth only alters _would_ to
_will_." Tyrwhitt read:

 "For we would give much to use violent thefts,"

which is objectionable, not merely because it wanders from the text, but
because it inserts a phrase, "to _use_ violent thefts," which is awkward
and unlike Shakspeare. The reading I have adopted is that suggested by Mr.
Amyot, who observes upon it: "Here, I think, with little more than
transposition (_us_ being, substituted for _we_, and _would_ omitted), the
meaning, as far as we can collect it, is not departed from nor perverted,
as in Rowe's strange interpolation:

 "For us to count we give what's gain'd by thefts."

The original is one of the few passages which, as it seems to me, must be
left to the reader's sagacity, and of the difficulties attending which we
cannot arrive at any satisfactory solution."

Mr. Collier's better judgment has here given way to his deference for the
opinion of his worthy friend; the deviation from the old copy being quite
as violent as any that he has ever quarrelled with in others.

Bearing in mind MR. HICKSON'S valuable canon (which should be the guide of
future editors), let us see what is the state of the case. The line is a
nonsensical jumble, and has probably been printed from an interlineation in
the manuscript copy, two words being evidently transposed, and one of them,
at the same time, glaringly mistaken. The poet would never have repeated
the word _count_, which occurs in the first line, in the sense given to it
either by Mr. Collier or by Mr. Knight.

Preserving every word in the old copy, I read the passage thus:--

 "O! be persuaded. Do not count it holy
  To hurt by being just: it is as lawful as
  (For we would give much) to commit violent thefts
  And rob in the behalf of charity."

"To _count_ violent thefts" here would be sheer nonsense; and when we
recollect how easy it is to mistake _comit_ for _count_, the former word
being almost always thus written and often thus printed, we must, I think,
be convinced that in copying an interlineated MS., the printer _misplaced_
and _misprinted_ that word, and transposed _as_, if the repetition of it be
not also an error.--"For," commencing the parenthesis, "we would give much"
stands for _cause_. The emphasis should, I think, be {387} laid on _for_;
and _commit_ be accented on the first syllable. Thus the line, though of
twelve syllables, is not unmetrical; indeed much less prosaic than with the
old reading of _count_.

This correction, upon the principle which governs Messrs. Collier and
Knight, and which indeed should govern all of us,

 "To lose no drop of that immortal man,"

ought to be satisfactory; for it is effected without taking away a letter.
The transposition of two evidently _misplaced_ words, and the correction of
a letter or two palpably misprinted in one of them, is the whole gentle
violence that has been used in a passage which has been, as we see,
considered desperate. But, as Pope sings:

 "Our sacred Shakspeare,--comprehensive mind!
  Who for all ages writ, and all mankind,
  Has been to careless printers oft a prey,
  Nor time, nor moth e'er spoil'd as much as they;
  Let the right reading drive the cloud away,
  And sense breaks on us with resistless day."

MASTER JOHN SHORNE.

If proof were wanted how little is now known of those saints whose names
were once in everybody's mouth, although they never figured in any
calendar, it might be found in the fact that my friend, Mr. Payne Collier,
whose intimate knowledge of the phrases and allusions scattered through our
early writers is so well known and admitted, should, in his valuable
_Extracts from the Registers of the Stationers' Company_ (1557-1570), have
illustrated this entry,--

    "1569-70. Rd. of Thomas Colwell, for his lycense for the pryntinge of a
    ballett intituled 'Newes to Northumberlande yt skylles not where, to
    Syr John Shorne, a churche rebell there' ... iiij^d."

by a note, from which the following is an extract:--

    "Sir John Shorne no doubt is to be taken as a generic name for a shaven
    Roman Catholic priest."

Reasonable, however, as is Mr. Collier's conjecture, it is not borne out by
the facts of the case. The name Sir John Shorne is not a generic name, but
the name of a personage frequently alluded to, but whose history is
involved in considerable obscurity. Perhaps the following notes may be the
means, by drawing forth others, of throwing some light upon it. In Michael
Wodde's _Dialogue_, quoted by Brand, we read--

    "If we were sycke of the pestylence we ran to Sainte Rooke; if of the
    ague, to Sainte Pernel or Master John Shorne."

Latimer, in his _Second Sermon preached in Lincolnshire_, p. 475. (Parker
Society ed.), says,--

    "But ye shall not think that I will speak of the popish pilgrimages,
    which we were wont to use in times past, in running hither and thither
    to Mr. John Shorn or to our Lady of Walsingham."

On which the editor, the Rev. G. E. Corrie, remarks that he was--

    "A saint whose head quarters were probably in the parish of Shorn and
    Merston near Gravesend, but who seems to have had shrines in other
    parts of the country. He was chiefly popular with persons who suffered
    from ague."

Mr. Corrie then gives an extract from p. 218. of the _Letters relating to
the Suppression of Monasteries_, edited by Mr. Wright for the Camden
Society; but we quote from the original, Mr. Corrie having omitted the
words given in our extract in Italics:--

    "At Merston, Mr. Johan Schorn stondith blessing a bote, whereunto they
    do say he conveyd the devill. He ys moch sowzt for the agou. _If it be
    your lordeschips pleasur, I schall sett that botyd ymage in a nother
    place, and so do wyth other in other parties wher lyke seeking ys._"

In that extraordinary poem _The Fantassie of Idolatrie_, printed by Fox in
his edition of 1563, but not afterwards reprinted until it appeared in
Seeley's edition (vol. v. p. 406.), we read--

 "To Maister John Shorne
  That blessed man borne;
    For the ague to him we apply,
  Whiche jugeleth with a _bote_
  I beschrewe his herte rote
    That will truste him, and it be I."

The editor, Mr. Cattley, having explained _bote_ "a recompense or fee," Dr.
Maitland, in his _Remarks on Rev. S. R. Cattley's Defence of his Edition of
Fox's Martyrology_, p. 46., after making a reference to Nares, and quoting
his explanation, proceeds:

    "The going on pilgrimage to St. John Shorne is incidentally mentioned
    at pages 232. and 580. of the FOURTH volume of Fox, but in a way which
    throws no light on the subject. The verse which I have quoted seems as
    if there was some relic which was supposed to cure the ague, and by
    which the juggle was carried on. Now another passage in this same fifth
    volume, p. 468., leads me to believe that this relic really was, and
    therefore the word 'bote' simply means, a boot. In this passage we
    learn, that one of the causes of Robert Testwood's troyble was his
    ridiculing the relics which were to be distributed to be borne by
    various persons in a procession upon a relic Sunday. St. George's
    dagger having been given to one Master Hake, Testwood said to Dr.
    Clifton,--'Sir, Master Hake hath St. George's dagger. Now if he had his
    horse, and St. Martin's cloak, and _Master John Shorne's boots_, with
    King Harry's spurs and his hat, he might ride when he list.'"

That there is some legend connected with Master John Shorne and "his bote,
whereunto they do say he conveyd the devill," is evident from {388} a fact
we learn from the _Proceedings of the Archaeological Institute_, namely,
that at the meeting on the 5th Nov. 1847, the Rev. James Bulwer, of
Aylsham, Norfolk, sent a series of drawings exhibiting the curious painted
decorations of the rood screen in Cawston Church, Norfolk, amongst which
appears the singular saintly personage bearing a boot, from which issues a
demon. An inscription beneath the figures gives the name "Magister Johannes
Schorn." It is much to be regretted that fuller details of this painting
have not been preserved in the Journal of the Institute.

The earliest mention of _Master John Schorne_ is in the indenture for
roofing St. George's Chapel at Windsor, dated 5th June, 21 Henry VII.
(1506), printed in the _Reliquiae Antiquae_, vol. ii. p. 115., where it is
covenanted

    "That the creastes, corses, beastes, above on the outsides of Maister
    John Shorne's Chappell, bee done and wrought according to the other
    creastes, and comprised within the said bargayne."

CORRIGENDA OF PRINTER'S ERRORS.

In my note on Conjectural Emendation (Vol. ii., p. 322.), your printer, in
general so very correct, has by a fortunate accident strengthened my
argument, by adding one letter, and taking away another. Should my note be
in existence, you will find that I wrote distinctly and correctly Mr.
Field's praenomen _Barron_, and not _Baron_. And I have too much respect for
my old favourite, honest George _Wither_, to have written _Withers_, a
misnomer never used but by his adversaries, who certainly did speak of him
as "one Withers." I should not have thought it necessary to notice these
insignificant errata, but for the purpose of showing _Printer's errors_ do
and will occur, and that Shakspeare's text may often be amended by their
correction. You will recollect honest George's punning inscription round
his juvenile portrait:

    "I GROW AND WITHER BOTH TOGETHER."

FOLK LORE OF WALES.

_No. 3. Meddygon Myddvai_.--On the heights of the Black Mountains, in
Caermarthenshire, lies a dark-watered lake, known by the name of _Lyn y Van
Vach_. As might be predicated, from the wild grandeur of its situation, as
well as from the ever-changing hues which it takes from the mountain
shadows, many a superstition--gloomy or beautiful--is connected with its
history. Amongst these may be reckoned the legend of the _Meddygon Myddvai_
or "surgeons of Myddvai." Tradition affirms that "once upon a time" a man
who dwelt in the parish of Myddvai led his lambs to graze on the borders of
this lake; a proceeding which he was induced to repeat in consequence of
his visits being celebrated by the appearance of three most beautiful
nymphs, who, rising from the waters of the lake, frequently came on shore,
and wandered about amongst his flock. On his endeavouring, however, to
catch or retain these nymphs, they fled to the lake and sank into its
depths, singing--

 "Cras dy fara,
  Anhawdd ein dala!"

which may be rendered [eater of] "hard baked bread, it is difficult to
retain us!" Difficulties, however, but increased the determination of the
shepherd; and day after day he watched beside the haunted lake, until at
length his perseverance was rewarded by the discovery of a substance
resembling unbaked bread, which floated on the water: this he fished up and
ate, and on the following day he succeeded in capturing the nymphs: on
which he requested one of them to become his wife; to this she consented,
on condition that he should be able to distinguish her from her sisters on
the following day. This was no easy task, as the nymphs bore the most
striking resemblance to each other; but the lover noticed some trifling
peculiarity in the dress of his choice, by means of which he identified
her. She then assured him that she would be to him as good a wife as any
_earthly_ maiden could be, until he should strike her three times without a
cause. This was deemed by the shepherd an impossible contingency, and he
led his bride in triumph from the mountain; followed by seven cows, two
oxen, and one bull, which she had summoned from the waters of the lake to
enrich her future home.

Many years passed happily on, and three smiling children--afterwards the
"surgeons of Myddvai"--blessed the shepherd and his Undine-like bride; but
at length, on requesting her to go to the field and catch his horse, she
replied that she would do so presently; when striking her arm three times
he exclaimed, _Dos, dos, dos_; Go, go, go. This was more than a free
dweller in the waters could brook; so calling her ten head of cattle to
follow her, she fled to the lake, and once more plunged beneath its waters.

Such is the legend; of which reason vainly expresses its disbelief, as long
as the eye of faith can discern physical proofs of its truth in the deep
furrow which, crossing the mountain in detached portions, terminates
abruptly in the lake; for it seems that when the two oxen were summoned by
their mistress, they were ploughing in the field; and at their departure,
they carried the plough with them, and dragged it into the lake.

The nymph once more appeared upon the earth; for as her sons grew to
manhood, she met them {389} one day in a place which, from this
circumstance, received the name of _Cwm Meddygon_, and delivered to each of
them a bag, containing such mysterious revelations in the science of
medicine, that they became greater in the art than were ever any before
them.

Though so curiously connected with this fable, the "surgeons of Myddvai"
are supposed to be historical personages, who, according to a writer in the
_Cambro-Briton_, flourished in the thirteenth century, and left behind them
a MS. treatise on their practice, of which several fragments and imperfect
copies are still preserved.

_No. 4. Trwyn Pwcca._--Many years ago, there existed in a certain part of
Monmouthshire a Pwcca, or fairy, which, like a faithful English Brownie,
performed innumerable services for the farmers and householders in its
neighbourhood, more especially that of feeding the cattle, and cleaning
their sheds in wet weather; until at length some officious person,
considering such practices as unchristian proceedings, laid the kindly
spirit for three generations, banishing him to that common receptacle for
such beings--the Red Sea. The spot in which he disappeared obtained the
name of _Trwyn Pwcca_ (Fairy's nose); and as the three generations have
nearly passed away, the approaching return of the Pwcca is anxiously looked
forward to in its vicinity, as an earnest of the "good time coming."

The form which tradition assigns to this Pwcca, is that of a handful of
loose dried grass rolling before the wind (such as is constantly seen on
moors); a circumstance which recalls to mind the Pyrenean legend of the

any connexion with the supposed habit of appearing in this form?

CONNEXION OF WORDS--THE WORD "FREIGHT."

The word employed to denote _freight_, or rather the _price of freight_, at
this day in the principal ports of the Mediterranean, is _nolis_, _nolo_,
&c. In the Arabian and Indian ports, the word universally employed to
denote the same meaning is _nol_. Are these words identical, and can their
connexion be traced? When we consider the extensive commerce of the
Phoenicians, both in the Mediterranean and Indian seas, that they were the
great merchants and carriers of antiquity, and that, in the words of
Hieron, "their numerous fleets were scattered over the Indian and Atlantic
oceans; and the Tyrian pennant waved at the same time on the coasts of
Britain and on the shores of Ceylon"--it is natural to look to that country
as the birthplace of the word, whence it may have been imported, westward
to Europe, and eastward to India, by the same people. And we find that it
is a pure Arabic word, [Arabic: nwl] _nawil_ and [Arabic: nwln] _nawlun_,
or _nol_ and _nolan_, both signifying _freight_ (price of carriage), from
the root [Arabic: nwh] _noh, pretium dedit, donum_. I am not aware that the
word _freight_ (not used in the sense of cargo or merchandise, but as the
_price_ of carriage of the merchandise, _merces pro vectura_) is to be
found in the Old Testament, otherwise some light might be thrown on the
matter by a reference to the cognate Hebrew word.

But here an interesting question presents itself. The word _freight_ in
Greek is [Greek: naulos] or [Greek: naulon], and in Latin _naulum_. Have
these any connexion with the Arabic word, or are they to be traced to an
independent source, and the coincidence in sense and sound with the Arabic
merely accidental? If distinct, are the words now in use in the
Mediterranean ports derived from the Greek or the Arabic? If the words be
not identical, may not the Greek be derived from the Sanscrit, thus
[Sanskrit: nau], _nau_, or in the pure form [Sanskrit: nawah], _nawah_, or
resolved, _naus_, a ship or boat; [Sanskrit: nauyayin], _nauyayin_ quasi
_nouyayil_, or abbreviated _naul_, that which goes into a ship or boat,
_i.e._ freight, fare, or, by metonyme, the price of freight, or
passage-money. It is to be noted that _nolis_, though in general use in the
Mediterranean ports (Marseilles, for example) to denote the price of
freight, or of carriage, is not so in the northern parts of France. At
Havre the word is _fret_, the same as our _freight_, the German _fracht_,
viz. that which is _carried_ or _ferried_, and, by metonyme, as before, the
_price_ of carriage.

Minor Notes.

_Smith's Obituary._--One of the publications of the Camden Society for the
year 1849 is the _Obituary of Richard Smyth_ (extending from 1627 to 1674),
edited by Sir Henry Ellis. It is printed from a copy of the Sloane MS. in
the Brit. Mus., No. 886., which is itself but a transcript, later than
Smyth's time. The editor states that "where the original manuscript of the
obituary is deposited is not at present known."

I am glad at being able to supply the information here wanted. The original
manuscript is in the _University Library_ at Cambridge, marked Mm. 4. 36.
It consists of twenty-nine leaves, foolscap folio; and, except that the
edges and corners of the leaves are occasionally worn by frequent perusal,
is otherwise in excellent condition. It is well and clearly written, but
the latter part of it marks the alteration of the hand by the advancing
years of the writer. There are many variations in {390} the orthography,
and some omissions, in the Camden Society's publication, but perhaps not
more than may be accounted for by supposing the Sloane copy to have been
made by a not very careful transcriber.

Here again is seen the valuable use which might be made of your excellent
publication. Had a "Hue and Cry" been made in the "NOTES AND QUERIES" after
the original MS. of this obituary, information might have been immediately
given which would have added greatly to the value of this number of the
Camden Society's publications.

_George Wither the Poet, A Printer._--In the "_Premonition_ to the Reader"
prefixed to George Wither's _Britain's Remembrancer_, 12mo. 1628, the
author acquaints us with some circumstances relative to his work which are
not generally known. While craving some apology for his writing, Wither
observes:

    "It is above two years since I laboured to get this booke printed, and
    it hath cost me more money, more pains, and much more time to publish
    it, than to compose it, for I was faine to imprint every sheet thereof
    _with my owne hand_, because I could not get allowance to doe it
    publikely."

_Corruption of the Text of Gibbon's "Decline and Fall."_--A corruption,
which seems to have arisen from an attempt at emendation, has crept into
Note 17. on the 55th chapter of Gibbon's _History_. _Root_ is twice printed
instead of _roof_ in the later editions, including, Mr. Milman's. "What
comes from the roof," may not be very intelligible; still _roof_ is the
word in the original edition of Gibbon, where it corresponds to _toit_ in
Gibbon's authority, Fleury, and to _tectum_ in Fleury's authority.

_Traditional Story concerning Cardinal Wolsey._--In David Hughson (Dr.
Pugh's) _Walks through London and the surrounding Suburbs_, 12mo. 1817,
vol. ii. p. 366., I find the following:--

    "Passing on to _Cheshunt_: here is a plain brick edifice, in which
    Cardinal Wolsey is said to have resided. It has been nearly rebuilt
    since his time, but is still surrounded by a deep moat. In the upper
    part of this house, called Cheshunt House, is a room, the door of which
    is stained with blood: the tradition is--an unfortunate lady became a
    victim to the Cardinal's jealousy, and that he dispatched her with his
    own hand. If so, it is unaccountable that the murderer should have
    suffered those marks of his violence to have remained."

Is there any _old_ authority for this charge against the Cardinal?

Queries.

EARLY SALE OF GEMS, DRAWINGS, AND CURIOSITIES.

At the risk of showing my ignorance, I wish to have it removed by answers
to my present Queries.

I have before me a printed catalogue of a collection of antiques, drawings,
and curiosities, which were to be sold by auction not far from a century
and a half ago. It is upon a sheet of four pages, rather larger than
foolscap, which it entirely fills. It seems to me a remarkable assemblage
of valuable relics, and it is thus headed:--

    "A catalogue, being an extraordinary and great collection of antiques,
    original drawings, and other curiosities, collected by a gentleman very
    curious ... will be sold by auction at Covent Garden Coffee House, in
    the Little Piazza, on Wednesday next, being the 9th instant June,
    1714."

This is the oldest English catalogue of the kind that I happen to have met
with, and my first question upon it is, is there any older? Next, if the
fact be known, who was the "gentleman very curious" who owned the
collection?

We are farther informed by the auctioneer (whose name is not given), that
"The antiques are all in precious stones, most of them engraved by the
greatest masters of the old Greeks and Romans; the drawings are of the
oldest and the best Italian masters;" and it is advertised, besides, that
"the aforesaid rarities may be seen on Monday the 7th, Tuesday the 8th, and
Wednesday till the time of sale, which will begin at 11 o'clock in the
morning for the antiques, and at 6 o'clock in the evening for the
drawings." After a statement that the "conditions of sale are as usual," we
come to the list of the gems, under the heads of "Names of the Jewels," and
"What they represent." There are fifty-one lots of those that are "set in
silver for seals," and they are upon cornelian, beril, sardonix, jasper,
&c. For the purpose of identification (if possible) I will quote two or
three:--

 "3. Sardonix--The head of Anacreon.
  17. Cornelian--Pallas crowning Hercules.
  30. Beryl--The Trojan Horse, as in Fortuna Lyceto.
  51. A cornelian ring, with the head of Lais of Corinth, engraved by Mr.
      Christian."

To these succeed twelve lots of "stones not set," including a "Head of
Christ," a "Gadetian Droll," the "Entry of Severus, the Emperor, into
Britain," &c. Then we come to 22. "Camejus, for the most part modern;" and
to 10. "Other extraordinary Rarities," including

  4. "The Picture of Mathew of Leyden, King of the Anabaptists, done in
      miniature by Holbein.
  7. A box with 8 Calcedonies set in gold, in which are engraved the
      Passion of our Saviour," &c.

{391}

The "antiques set in gold, being rings or seals," are thirty-seven in
number; among them

 "8. Ennius the poet, with this motto, _Sine lucto memento_, a seal.
 "19. Homer deified, a seal.
 "34. A double seal of Charles I., King of England, and Henrietta, daughter
     of Henry IV. of France, &c., with a motto of _Castus Amor vinxit_.
     Engraved by _Simon Monuntum Preclarissimum_."

The Drawings come last, and are divided into seven _Porta Folios_,
containing respectively 21, 23, 30, 23, 24, 26 and 42 specimens. In the
first two no names of the masters are given: in the third, they are all
assigned to various artists, including Emskirk (I spell names as I find
them), Paulo Veronesa, Raphael, Leonardo da Vinci, Tintorett, Giulio
Romano, &c. The fourth portfolio has only one name to the 23 lots, viz.
Tintorett; and Filippo Bellin is the only master named in the fifth
portfolio. In the sixth, we meet with Tintorett, Perugino, Mich. Ang.
Bonaroti, Annibal Caracci, Paulo Brill, and Raphael. Of the 42 drawings in
Portfolio 7. all have names annexed to them, excepting eight; and here we
read those of Guido Reni, Gio Bellini, Andrea Mantegna, Corregio, Andrea
del Sarto, Tadeo Zuccaro, &c.

I may have gone into more detail than was necessary; but, besides the
Queries I have already put, I want to know if any of these gems, cameos,
antiques, or drawings are now known to be in existence; and, if possible,
where they are to be found.

MINOR QUERIES.

_Quotations wanted._--I shall be greatly obliged to any of the
correspondents of your most interesting and useful publication who will
kindly inform me in what authors the following passages are to be found,
and will, if it can be done without too much trouble, give me the
references necessary for tracing them:--

 "Par un peu de sang bien repandu,
  L'on en epargne beaucoup."

And

 "Quadrijugis invectus equis Sol aureus extat,
  Cui septem veriis circumdant vestibus Horae:
  Lucifer antesolat: rapidi fuge lampada Solis,
  Aurora, umbrarum victrix, neo victa recedas."

The latter I have only seen subjoined to a print of Guido's celebrated
Aurora, at Rome; and I should have supposed it might have been written for
the occasion, had I not been told, upon authority in which I put
confidence, that it is to be found in some classic author. If so, the lines
may possibly have given rise to the painting, and not the painting to the
lines.

_Avidius Varus._--Can you, or any of your readers, tell me who _Avidius
Varus_ was, referred to in the following passage:

 "Sed _Avidii Vari_ illud hic valeat:
   'Aut hoc quod produxi testium satis est, aut nihil satis.'"

I find reference made to him as above, in one of the Smith manuscripts; but
I cannot discover his name in any catalogue or biographical dictionary. Is
he known by any other name?

J. SANSOM.

_Death of Richard II._--By what authority has the belief that Richard II.
died in Pontefract Castle, in Yorkshire, arisen? Every history that I have
consulted (with the exception, indeed, of Lord Lyttleton's) coolly assumes
it as a fact, in the teeth of the contemporary Froissart, who says plainly
enough--

    "Thus they left the _Tower of London where he had died_, and paraded
    the streets at a foot's pace till they came to
    Cheapside."--_Froissart's Chronicles_, translated by Johnes, vol. vii.
    p. 708.

It is barely possible that our modern historians may have been misled by
Shakspeare, who makes Pontefract the scene of his death.

Another circumstance which militates against the received story, is the
fact that all historians, I believe, agree that his _dead body_ was
conveyed to burial from the Tower of London. Now, it seems odd, to say the
least, that if he really died at Pontefract, and his corpse was removed to
London, that no one mentions this removal--that Froissart had not heard of
it, although, from the nature of the country, the want of good roads, &c.,
the funeral convoy must have been several days upon the road. Can any one
give me any information upon this question? I may just say that, of course,
no reliance can be placed on the fact of the "very identical tower" in
which the deposed king died being shown at Pontefract.

_Sir W. Herschel's Observations and Writings._--Will you permit me to
propose the following Queries in your excellent paper.

1. I have a note to the following effect, but it is without date or
reference. The late Sir W. Herschel, during an examination of the heavens
in which he was observing stars that have a proper motion, saw one of the
7.8 magnitude near the 17th star 12 hour of Piazzi's Catalogue, and noted
the approximate distance between them; on the third night after, he saw it
again, when it had advanced a good deal, having gone farther to the
eastward, and towards the equator. Bad weather, and the advancing twilight,
prevented Sir William's getting another observation. Meantime the estimated
movement in three days was 10" in right ascension, and about a minute, or
rather less, towards the north. "So slow a motion," he says, {392} "would
make me suspect the situation to be beyond Uranus." What I wish to inquire
is this: has it been established by calculation whether the new planet
discovered by Adams and Le Verrier was or was not the star observed at the
time and in the place specified by Sir William Herschel?

2. Have Sir W. Herschel's contributions to the _Philosophical Transactions_
ever been published in a separate form? and if so, where they can be
obtained?

_Swearing by Swans._--

    "At the banquet held on this occasion, he vowed before God and the

    the Scottish rebels."--Keightley's _History of England_, vol. i. p.
    249. ed. 1839.

What authority is there for this statement respecting the swans? What was
the origin and significance of the usage to which allusion is here made?

_Automachia._--I am the possessor of a little book, some 21/2 inches long by
11/2 wide, bound in green velvet, entitled _Automachia, or the Self-conflict
of a Christian_, and dedicated

    "To the most noble, vertuous, and learned lady, the Lady Mary Nevil,
    one of the daughters of the Right Honourable the Earl of Dorcet, Lord
    High Treasurer of England."

The book commences with an anagram on the lady's name:

 "Add but an A to Romanize your name
  _Another Pallas_ is your anagram,
              Videlicet
              Maria Nevila
              Alia Minerva."

And then follow some "Stanzes Dedicatory," subscribed--

    Most deuoted to your honourable vertues.--J. S."

On the last page is--

    "London, printed by Milch Bradwood, for Edward Blount, 1607."

The _Automachia_ is a poem of 188 lines, in heroic metre, and is followed
by a shorter poem, entitled "A Comfortable Exhortation to the Christian in
his Self-conflict."

Do any of your correspondents know of the existence or authorship of this
little work? It is not in the British Museum, nor could the curators of the
library there, to whom it was shown, make out anything about it.

The discovery of its authorship might tend to throw some light on that of
"The Pedlar's Song," attributed to Shakspeare, and appearing in Vol. i., p.
23. of "NOTES AND QUERIES." The song contains the line--

 "Such is the sacred hunger for gold."

And in the _Automachia_ I find the "auri sacra fames" described as--

 "Midas' desire, the miser's only trust,
  The sacred hunger of Pactolian dust."

_Camden's Poem on Marriage of the Thames and Isis._--I should esteem it a
favour if any reader of the "NOTES AND QUERIES" would inform me where I can
find a Latin poem of Camden's on the "Marriage of the Thames with the
Isis." In his work styled _Britannia_ (which was enlarged by Richard Gough,
in 3 vols., fol. Lond. 1789), in vol. i. p. 169., under Surrey, Camden
himself quotes two passages; and in vol. ii., under Middlesex, p. 2., one
passage, from the above-mentioned poem. I have in vain made many endeavours
to find the _entire poem_. I have examined the original work, as well as
all the translations of _Britannia, sive Florentissimorum Regnorum Angliae,
etc., chorographica descriptio; Gulielmo Camdeno, authore_, Londini, 1607,
folio. All these contain the quotations I have specified, but no more, and
I am anxious to see the whole of the poem.

_National Airs of England._--Among the national gleanings which are sent to
your journal, I have not seen any that relate to the traditional music of
England. We allow our airs to be stolen on all sides, and, had not Mr.
Chappell acted the part of a detective, might never have recovered our own
property. Ireland has taken "My Lodging is on the cold Ground" and "The
Girls we leave behind us," while Scotland has laid claim to all her own _at
least_, and Germany is laying violent hands on "God save the Queen."

Under these circumstances, would it not be a good thing, for those who have
the power, to communicate the simple air of any song which appears native
to our country, together with the words? I fancy that in this way we should
gain many hints, besides musical ones, highly interesting to your readers.

_"The Owl is abroad."_--On what ground is the fine base song, "The Owl is
abroad," attributed to Henry Purcell? Dr. Clarke has done so in his

_Memoirs of the Musical Drama_, speaking of Purcell's _Tempest_, says:

    "There is a song for Caliban, _The Owl is abroad, the Bat and the
    Toad_, which one might suppose Weber to have imagined."

Is it not really the property of John Christopher Smith, the friend of
Handel? Amongst the few books of printed music in the _British Museum
Catalogue_ is _The Tempest, an Opera, composed by Mr. Smith_, in which is
the base song in question. On the other hand, I do not find it in Purcell's
_Tempest_. If, as I imagine, it belongs to Mr. Smith, it seems peculiarly
hard that the credit of the composition should be taken from him, to be
given to one who stands in no need of it.

    when;' with other strange tales that went on her I neglect to insert,
    as fitter for a romance than to mingle with so much truth and integrity

it is stated, in a note upon the death of Oliver Cromwell, that his body
exhibited certain appearances "owing to the disease of which the Protector
died, which, by the by, appeared to be that of poison." The words,

for this statement?

COLLAR OF SS.

(Vol. ii., pp. 89. 194. 248. 280. 330. 362.)

The dispute about the Collar of SS., between MR. J. GOUGH NICHOLS and
ARMIGER, is, as Sir Lucius O'Trigger would say, "a mighty pretty quarrel as
it stands;" but I have seen no mention by either writer of "the red sindon"
for the chamber of Queen Philippa, "beaten throughout with the letter S in
gold leaf:" or the throne of Henry V. powdered with the letter S, in an
illuminated MS. of his time, in Bennet College Library, Cambridge. I fancy
there will be some difficulty in reconciling these two examples with the
theory of either of the disputants. When ARMIGER alludes to the monument of
Matilda Fitzwalter, "who lived in the reign of King John," I presume he is
aware that the effigy is not of that period. I do not think any of the
seekers of this hidden signification can be said to be even _warm_ yet,
much less to burn.

J. R. PLANCHE.

_Collar of SS._--As I conceive that the description of this Collar by your
correspondent C. (Vol. ii., p. 330.) is not strictly correct, I forward you
drawings of two examples: No. 1. from the monument of Sir Humphrey Stafford
(and which is the general type); No. 2. from that of the husband of
Margaret Holand, Countess of Somerset (Gough's _Funeral Monuments_). The
latter example might have been called a Collar of 8, 8, were it not that
that name is less euphonious than SS. The collar was worn by several
ladies. (See the work above quoted.)

B. W.

    [The figures in the example No. 1. forwarded by B. W. cannot possibly
    have been intended for {394} anything but SS.; while, on the other
    hand, those in No. 2., as he rightly observes, are more like figures 8,
    8, than the letters SS.]

While the origin of the Collar of Esses is instructively occupying your
correspondents, allow me to direct your attention to the enclosed paragraph
extracted from the _Morning Post_ of the 18th instant, from which it
appears that Lord Denman's collar has been "obtained" (_Qy._ by purchase?)
by the corporation of Derby for the future use of their mayor. I wish to
know, can a _Quo warranto_ issue to the said mayor for the assumption of
this badge? and if not, in whom does the power reside of correcting this
abuse, if such it be?

    "THE GOLD CHAIN OF THE LORD CHIEF JUSTICE OF ENGLAND.--On Wednesday
    week, at a meeting of the corporation of Derby, the mayor stated that
    the chain he then had the honour to wear was the one worn by the Lord
    Chief Justice of England, and that it had been obtained from Lord
    Denman by the corporation for all future chief magistrates of the
    borough. We understand the corporation obtained the chain upon the same
    terms as it would have been transferred to Lord Campbell, if his
    lordship had taken to it from his noble predecessor."--(_Quoted from
    Nottingham Journal, in Morning Post_, 18th Oct. 1850.)

F. S. Q.

The inclosed paragraph, extracted from the _Morning Post_ of last Saturday
completes the history of the municipal collar of the corporation of Derby,
concerning which I recently proposed a Query. The right to purchase does
not, however, establish the right to wear such a decoration.

    "THE INSIGNIA OF MAYORALTY.--Considerable excitement prevails just now
    in many municipal corporations respecting the insignia of mayoralty. At
    Derby the mayor has recently obtained the gold chain worn by Lord
    Denman when Lord Chief Justice. In reference to a question whether or
    not the chain was a present, a correspondent of the _Derby Mercury_
    says, 'I am sorry to admit, it was a bargain; it cost 100l., and is
    paid for. The chain is the property of the corporation, and will grace
    the neck of every succeeding mayor. The robes did not accompany the
    chain; they are bran new, gay in colour, a good cut, and hang well;
    they are private property, consequently not necessarily transferable.
    Every mayor will have the privilege of choosing the shape and colour of
    his official vestment, and can retain or dispose of it as he may deem
    proper. It was suggested that the robes should be the property of the
    corporation, but a difficulty arose, from the fact, that mayors differ
    as much in their bodies as they do in their minds, so that one measure
    would not conveniently fit all. Economically speaking, the suggestion
    was a valuable one, but the physical difficulty was insurmountable. It
    has been hinted that a wardrobe of habiliments for different sized
    mayors might be kept on hand at the Town-Hall, but as the cost would be
    great, and the arrangement would partake too much of the customary
    preparation for a fancy ball or masquerade, it was thought
    objectionable. The Liberal corporation have, therefore, very properly
    resolved on throwing no obstacle in the way of Free Trade, and it is
    their determination to enable all mayors, in the selection of their
    vestures, to buy in the cheapest market and sell in the
    dearest.'"--_Morning Post_, Oct. 26. 1850.

F. S. Q.

As I was the first to open the fire on the very puzzling subject of the SS.
Collar, which has led to more pleasant and profitable, though _warm_
discussion, than ever any person could have expected, it seems now to be
time for some to step forward as a moderator; and if I be allowed to do so,
it will be to endeavour to check the almost _uncourteous_ way in which our
ARMIGER friend has taken up the gauntlet on the question.

If, Sir, you admit _severe_ and sneering criticism, it will, it may be
feared, tend very considerably to mar the influence and advantage to be
drawn from your useful pages, which are intended, I conceive, for calm,
friendly and courteous interchange of useful information. Without
vituperating the _lucubrations_ of MR. JOHN GOUGH NICHOLS, or sneering at
those who "pin faith on his dicta," which have much merit (Vol. ii., p.
363.), it would be surely possible for ARMIGER to advance his own views
with good temper and friendly feeling.

I have also a word to say to MR. NICHOLS on his remarks on MR. ELLACOMBE'S
view. He imputes to MR. E. ignorance of the "real formation of the collar."
He could only mean that the S hook or link gave _the idea_ of such an
ornamental chain; and I believe he is correct: which ornament the taste of
the workman would adopt and fashion as we now have it, with the insertion
of another link both for the comfort of the wearer, and for variety in the
construction.

A series of SSes (SSS) by themselves would certainly be a galling badge,
whatever honour might be considered to be conferred with it.

_Collar of Esses._--I am glad to see the interest shown by your
correspondents upon this curious subject, and the various opinions
expressed by them as to the actual formation of the collar; the
signification of the letter, if a letter be intended (of which I think
there can be no reasonable doubt); and the persons who were privileged to
wear it. The first two questions will for ever occasion discussion; but
allow me to suggest that one step towards the solution of the third, would
be a collection in your pages of the names of those persons who, either on
their monumental effigies or brasses, or in their portraits or otherwise,
are {395} represented as wearing that ornament; together with a short
statement of the position held by each of these individuals in the court of
the then reigning monarch, seeming to warrant the assumption. Some notices
of this sort have been already given, and your antiquarian correspondents
will readily supply others; so that in a little time you will have obtained
such a list as will greatly assist the inquiry. It may serve as a
commencement if I refer to the atchievement of Thomas Mowbray, Duke of
Norfolk, in the reign of Richard II., a representation of which is given in
_Archaeologia_, vol. xxix. p. 387., where the Collar of Esses is introduced
in a very peculiar manner.

    facts as he points out.]

DANIEL DE FOE.

Having been much interested with Daniel Defoe's description of a _Gravesend
Tiltboat_ in the year 1724, as recorded by ALPHA in Vol. ii., p. 209., I
think some of your readers may be pleased to learn that it is quite
possible that "it may be a plain relation of matter of fact," as De Foe was
engaged in the business of brick and tile making near Tilbury[1], and must
consequently have had frequent occasion to make the trip from Gravesend to
London. That De Foe was so engaged at Tilbury we learn from the following
Proclamation for his apprehension, taken from the _London Gazette_, dated
St. James's, January 10, 1702-3:--

    WHEREAS Daniel de Foe, alias Fooe, is charged with writing a scandalous
    and seditious pamphlet, entitled _The Shortest Way with the
    Dissenters_. He is a middled siz'd spare man, about forty years old, of
    a brown complexion, and dark brown-coloured hair, but wears a wig; a
    hooked nose, a sharp chin, grey eyes, and a large mole near his mouth;
    was born in London, and, for many years an hose-factor in Freeman's
    Yard, Cornhill, and is now owner of the brick and pantile works near
    Tilbury Fort, in Essex. Whoever shall discover the said Daniel de Foe
    to one of Her Majesty's principal secretaries of state, or any one of
    Her Majesty's justices of the peace, so as he may be apprehended, shall
    have a reward of fifty pounds, which Her Majesty has ordered
    immediately to be paid on such discovery."

He soon gave himself up; and having been tried, he stood in the pillory
with great fortitude: for soon after he published his poem, entitled _A
Hymn to the Pillory_, in which are the following singular lines:--

 "Men that are men, in thee can feel no pain,
  And all thy insignificants disdain;
  Contempt, that false new word for shame,
  Is, without crime, an empty name;
  A shadow to amuse mankind,
  But never frights the wise or well fix'd mind--
  Virtue despises human scorn,
  And scandals innocence adorn."

Referring to a design of putting the learned Selden into the pillory for
his _History of Tithes_, he says smartly:--

 "Even the learned Selden saw
  A prospect of thee thro' the law;
  He had thy lofty pinnacles in view,
  But so much honour never was they due.
  Had the great Selden triumph'd on thy stage,
  Selden, the honour of his age,
  No man would ever shun thee more,
  Or grudge to stand where Selden stood before."

This original poem ends with these remarkable lines, referring to himself:

 "Tell them, the men that placed him here,
  Are scandals to the times,
  Are at a loss to find his guilt,
  And can't commit his crimes."

De Foe, however, was afterwards received into favour without any
concessions on his part, and proceeded straight onwards in the discharge of
what he deemed to be his duty to mankind. He certainly was an extraordinary
man for disinterestedness, perseverance, and industry.

[Footnote 1: Traces of these tile-works are still discoverable in a field
some three or four hundred yards on the London side of Tilbury.

    [Wilson, in his _Life of Defoe_, vol. i. pp. 228. et seq., gives some
    interesting particulars of Defoe's share in these pantile works, and of
    his losses in connexion with them. Pantiles had been hitherto a Dutch
    manufacture, and brought in large quantities into England; the works at
    Tilbury were erected for the purpose of superseding the necessity for
    such importation, and providing a new channel for the employment of
    labour.--ED.]

"ANTIQUITAS SAECULI JUVENTUS MUNDI."

(Vol. ii., pp. 218. 350.)

T. J. and his Dublin friend (Vol. ii., p. 350.), appear to refer, one to
the Latin version, the other to the original English text of Lord Bacon's
_Instauration_; and, oddly enough, the inference to which either points, as
a reason for disbelieving in the previous existence of the phrase
"Antiquitas" &c., extends not to the authority consulted by the other.
Thus, the circumstance of "_ordine retrogrado_" being printed also in
Italics, is true only in respect of the _English_ text; while, on the other
{396} hand, "_ut vere dicamus_" is an expression to be found only in the
_Latin_.

But it may be doubted whether the originality of the phrase "Antiquitas
saeculi juventus mundi" is, after all, worth speculating upon. In the sense
in which Lord Bacon used it, it is rather a naked truism than a wise
aphorism. It does not even necessarily convey the intended meaning; nor, if
unaccompanied by an explanation, would it be safe from a widely different
interpretation. A previous correspondent of "NOTES AND QUERIES" had termed
it "this fine aphoristic expression;" and yet, when Lord Bacon himself
expands the thought into an aphorism, he does so without recurring to the
phrase in question, which is a tolerably fair proof that he did not look
upon it as a peculiarly happy one. (_Novum Organum_, lib. 1., Aphorismus
LXXXIV.)

T. J. infers that if the phrase were a quotation it would have been
preceded by "ut dictum est" rather than by "ut dicamus"--but even if it had
been introduced by the first of these forms, it does not appear that it
would thereby have been proved to be a quotation; because there are
instances wherein Lord Bacon directly refers to the source from which he
professes to quote, and yet prefers to give the purport in his own words
rather than in those of his author. Thus, in citing one of the most
exquisite and familiar passages of Lucretius, he introduces it by the
prefix, "_Poeta elegantissime dixit_." And yet what follows, although
printed in italics with every appearance of strict quotation, is not the
language of Lucretius, but a commonplace prose version of its substance.
(_Sermones Fideles_, De Veritate.)

With reference to Lord Bacon's works, there are two Queries which I wish to
ask.

T. J.'s friend mentions a rare translation into English by Gilbert Wats,
Oxford, as existing in Primate Marsh's library. Query, _Of what_ is it a
translation?

In Lord Bacon's life, by William Rawley, it is stated that his lordship was
born in a house "infra plateam dictum _Le Strand_ juxta Londinum."

Query, Was the Strand ever known as _Le Strand_, similarly to
Adwick-_le-street_ in Yorkshire?

_Sir Gammer Vans_ (Vol. ii., pp 89. 280.).--The story related by S. G. is
the same that I inquired after, and I admire the accuracy of his memory,
for his version is, for the greater part, _literally_ the same that I heard
in Ireland sixty years ago. A few passages, as that about _hipper
switches_, I do not recollect; and one or two that I remember are
wanting--the one, that the narrator was received in "a little _oak_
parlour" of, I forget what, different character; the other, that Sir
Gammer's "mother," or "aunt, was a justice of peace, and his sister a
captain of horse." I find that Goldsmith's allusion is to this last
passage, with some variation. Tony Lumpkin tells Marlow that Hardcastle
will endeavour to persuade him that "his mother was an alderman and his
aunt a justice of peace." (_She Stoops to Conquer_, A. i. _sub fine_.) I
have not been able to find the allusion in Swift; nor can I see how it
could have been a _political_ satire. It seems rather to be a mere tissue
of incongruities and contradictions--of Irish bulls, in short, woven into a
narrative to make folks laugh; and it is much of the same character as many
other pieces of ingenious nonsense with which Swift and Sheridan used to
amuse each other.

C.

_Sir Gammer Vans._--This worthy is mentioned in that curious little
chap-book, _A Strange and Wonderful Relation of the Old Woman that was
drowned at Ratcliff Highway_, in two parts. I now quote the passage from a
copy of the genuine Aldermary churchyard edition:--

    "At last I arrived at Sir John Vang's house. 'Tis a little house
    entirely alone, encompassed about with forty or fifty houses, having a
    brick wall made of flint stone round about it. So knocking at the door,
    Gammer Vangs, said I, is Sir John Vangs within? Walk in, said she, and
    you shall see him in the little, great, round, three square parlour.
    This Gammer Vangs had a little old woman her son. Her mother was a
    churchwarden of a large troop of horse, and her grandmother was a
    Justice of the Peace; but when I came into the said great, little,
    square, round, three corner'd parlour, I could not see Sir John Vangs,
    for he was a giant. But I espied abundance of nice wicker bottles. And
    just as I was going out he called to me and asked me what I would have?
    So looking back I espied him just creeping out of a wicker bottle. It
    seems by his profession he was a wicker bottle maker. And after he had
    made them, he crept out at the stopper holes."

There are two notes worth recording with respect to this curious medley,
which is obviously a modern version of a much older composition. Query, is
any older edition known?

1. That the wood-cut on the title page, which has been re-engraved for Mr.
Halliwell's _Notices of Fugitive Tracts and Chap-books_, printed for the
Percy Society, is one of the few representations we have of the old
_Ducking Stool_.

2. That it is said that the Rev. Thomas Kerrich, the well-known librarian
of the University of Cambridge, could repeat by heart the whole of the
eight and forty pages of this strange gallimawfrey.

_Hipperswitches_ (Vol. ii., p. 280.).--I saw a story which was copied into
the _Examiner_ of Oct. 5. from "NOTES AND QUERIES," entitled "Sir Gammer
Vans." The correspondent who has furnished {397} you with the tale says
that he is ignorant of the meaning of "hipper switches." Now hipper is a
word applied in this part of the country to a description of osiers used in
coarse basket making, and which were very likely things to be bound up into
switches. A field in which they grow, near the water side, is called a
"hipper-holm." There is a station on the Lancashire and Yorkshire railway,
which takes its name from such a meadow. My nurse, a Cornwall woman, tells
me _hipper_ withies fetch a higher price than common withies in her
country.

_Cat and Bagpipes_ (Vol. ii., p. 266.).--A public-house of considerable
notoriety, with this sign, existed long at the corner of Downing Street,
next to King Street. It was also used as a chop-house, and frequented by
many of those connected with the public offices in the neighbourhood.

An old friend told me that many years ago he met George Rose,--so well
known in after life as the friend of Pitt, clerk of the Parliament,
secretary of the Treasury, &c., and executor of the Earl of
Marchmont,--then a bashful young man, at the Cat and Bagpipes.

I may mention that George Rose was one of the few instances which I have
met with, where a Scotsman had freed himself from the peculiarities of the
speech of his country. Sir William Grant was another. Frank Homer was a
third. I never knew another.

_Forlot, Firlot, or Furlet_ (Vol. i., p. 371.).--It may be interesting to
your correspondent J. S. to be informed that there is a measure of capacity
in universal use in this part of India called a _fara_ or _fura_, which is
identical in shape, and, as nearly as can be judged by the eye, in size,
with the Scottish _furlet_. The _fura_ is divided into sixteen _pilys_, a
small measure in universal use here; in like manner as the _furlet_ is
divided into sixteen _lipys_, which measure was, and I presume still is, in
general use throughout Scotland. A friend informs me that, in the west of
Scotland, the common pronunciation of the word _furlet_ is exactly the same
as that of the word _fura_ here by the Mahrattas. It is unnecessary to
point out the numerous instances in which such changes as that from _pily_
to _lipy_ take place _per metathesem_.

Now, an interesting subject of investigation, supposing the coincidence
above noticed not to be an accidental one, would be to trace the links of
connexion between these words; and in this, some of your German readers may
be enabled to afford valuable aid.

As an illustration of the same article being in use in widely distant
localities, I may mention that on returning to England from a voyage to
China, I brought with me a Chinese _abacus_ or _swanpan_, the instrument in
general use among the Chinese for performing the ordinary computations of
addition, subtraction, &c., thinking it a grand article of curiosity,
particularly in a remote seaport town on the east coast, with which to
astonish the natives. But what was my chagrin when I was informed by an
honest Baltic skipper, that to him, at least the instrument was no rarity
at all; that he had seen them used hundreds of times for the same purposes
at various ports in the Baltic; and that, moreover, he had one of them in
his home at that very time, which he forthwith produced.

_Sitting during the Lessons_ (Vol. ii., p. 246.).--The rubric directing the
people to stand while the Gospel is read in the Communion service, was
first inserted in the Scotch Common Prayer Book, A. D. 1637. The ancient
and more reverential practice of standing whenever any portion of God's
word is read, had not fallen into entire disuse as late as 1686, as will
appear from the following extract from _The Life of Bishop Wilson_, by
Cruttwell, prefixed to the folio edition of his works. It occurs (p. 4.)
under certain heads of advice given to that holy bishop, at the time he was
ordained deacon, by his much-esteemed friend, Archdeacon Hewetson:--

    "Never to miss the church's public devotions twice a day, when
    unavoidable business, or want of health, or of a church (as in
    travelling), does not hinder. In church to behave himself also very
    reverently; nor ever turn his back upon the altar in service time, nor
    on the minister, when it can be avoided; _to stand at the lessons and
    epistle as well as at the gospel_, and especially when a psalm is sung:
    to bow reverently at the name of Jesus whenever it is mentioned in any
    of the church's offices; to turn towards the east when the Gloria Patri
    and the creeds are rehearsing; and to make obeisance at coming into,
    and going out of the church, and at going up to, and coming down from,
    the altar; are all ancient, commendable, and devout usages, and which
    _thousands_ of good people of our Church practise at this day, and
    amongst them, if he deserves to be reckoned amongst them, Thomas
    Wilson's dear friend."

_News_ (Vol. ii., p. 81.).--Much wit and ingenuity have been wasted on this
word. It seems {398} clear, however, that its origin is Dutch or German,
and probably Flemish, like the "NEW'S BOOK," so frequently occurring in the
correspondence of the seventeenth century.

Look into that valuable German, French, and Latin dictionary of the
Elzeviers, Amst. 1664, where you will find "NEWE, _F._ une novelle; _Lat._
nova, novorum." Then follow "Etwas newes, quelque chose de nouveau; Aliquid
novi;" and "Was newes, quelles nouvelles;" or, more accurately, "Quid novi;
quoi de nouveau?" The inference is forced upon us that, during the Flemish
wars, in which the Sidneys and a long catalogue of noble English volunteers
distinguished themselves, the thing and the term were imported hither.

Agreeably to so natural a presumption, the Hollandish "Nieuws" occurs, as a
neuter substantive, in the sense of "niewe tijding," or "nouvelles," and,
of course, the English "news," as perfect as can be wished. It is true that
the "Nieuws-Boek" now circulates under the modest name of
"Nieuws-Papieren," or of "Nieuws-Verteller:" but, to convince readers wise
enough not to expect in such matters as these a geometrical demonstration,
what is here humbly stated might suffice.

Were _Anschar, a Story of the North_, a mere work of fiction, we should not
think of recording its appearance in our columns. But it has other claims
to our notice and the attention of our readers. Based on the life of
Anschar the monk of Corbey, by Rembert, his successor in the archiepiscopal
see of Hamburgh,--a biography which the writer of the work before us
describes as one of the most important documents we possess for the
elucidation of the early history, manners, and religion of the races of
Northern Europe,--Mr. King has produced a narrative of considerable
interest, abounding in curious pictures of the social condition of the
Swedish people at the close of the ninth century. But Mr. King's pleasing
story has also this additional merit, that while his learning and
scholarlike acquirements have enabled him to illustrate the early history,
religion, customs, and superstitions of the North in a most interesting and
instructive manner, he has so done this, as at the same time to throw much
curious light on many of our own old-world customs, popular observances,
and folk-lore.

Such of our clerical readers as may be anxious to introduce cheap maps into
the schools under their superintendence, will thank us for calling their
attention to the series of _Penny Maps_ (twopence each with the boundaries
coloured), now publishing by Messrs. Chapman and Hall. That they have been
constructed and engraved by Mr. J. W. Lowry, is a sufficient guarantee for
their accuracy.

We have received a copy of Mr. Walker's engraving from Mr. Doyle's picture
of _Caxton submitting his proof-sheet to John Esteney, Abbot of
Westminster, in 1477_. The subject--and what can be of greater interest to
us than the great event it commemorates, the vast social change it has
wrought--has been very ably treated by the artist, and very successfully
rendered by the engraver. The calm dignity of the patriotic mercer, Master
William Caxton, as he watches the countenance of the abbot, who is
examining with astonishment this first specimen of the new art, contrasts
well with the expression of pride exhibited by Earl Rivers at the success
of his protege, on whose shoulder he rests his hand with an air
half-patronizing, half-familiar, and with Wynkyn de Worde at the case
behind, constitute altogether a picture which tells its story well and
effectually, and furnishes a Caxton Memorial which will doubtless be very
acceptable to all those who remember, with the gratitude due to him, the
many precious volumes with which the learning of Caxton, no less than his
mechanical genius, enriched the literature of England.

It is obvious that the use of a paper like "NOTES AND QUERIES" bears a
direct proportion to the extent of its circulation. What it aims at doing
is, to reach the learning which lies scattered not only throughout every
part of our own country, but all over the literary world, and to bring it
all to bear upon the pursuits of the scholar; to enable, in short, men of
letters all over the world to give a helping hand to one another. To a
certain extent, we have accomplished this end. Our last number contains
communications not only from all parts of the metropolis, and from almost
every county in England, but also from Scotland, Ireland, Holland, and even
from Demerara. This looks well. It seems as if we were in a fair way to
accomplish our design. But much yet remains to be done. We have recently
been told of whole districts in England so benighted as never to have heard
of "NOTES AND QUERIES;" and after an interesting question has been
discussed for weeks in our columns, we are informed of some one who could
have answered it immediately if he had seen it. So long as this is the case
the advantage we may confer upon literature and literary men is necessarily
imperfect. We do what we can to make known our existence through the
customary modes of announcement, and we gratefully acknowledge the kind
assistance and encouragement we derive from our brethren of the public
press; but we would respectfully solicit the assistance of our friends upon
this particular point. Our purpose is aided, and our usefulness increased
by every introduction which can be given to our paper, either to a Book
Club, to a Lending Library, or to any other channel of circulation amongst
persons of inquiry and intelligence. By such introductions scholars help
themselves as well as us, for there is no inquirer throughout the kingdom
who is not occasionally able to throw light upon some of the multifarious
objects which are discussed in our pages.

_Volume the First of_ "NOTES AND QUERIES," _with very copious Index, price_
9s. 6d. _bound in cloth, may still be had by order of all Booksellers._

_The Monthly Part for October, being the Fifth of_ Vol. II., _is also now
ready, price_ 1s. 3d.

NOTES AND QUERIES _may be procured by the Trade at noon on Friday: so that
out country Subscribers ought to experience no difficulty in receiving it
regularly. Many of the country Booksellers are probably not yet aware of
this arrangement, which enables them to receive Copies in their Saturday
parcels._

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
