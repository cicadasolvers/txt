_PREFACE_


_The collection of these humorous paragraphs has extended over a
number of years. Even a small beginning became a source of such
entertainment that the collection grew and grew, always without any
thought of publication._

_The man who can not laugh has yet to be found. Therein lies that
immediate appeal to a common ground which the sense of humor gives,
and it has been a conspicuous characteristic of those who look to the
public for appreciation and support. Lord Palmerston and Abraham
Lincoln were two notable examples of men for whom sympathy quickened
through their ready wit, and no political speaker drives home his
arguments half so well as he who can introduce a witty illustration.
The joke has ever been a potent factor in combating oppression and
corruption, in ridiculing shams. It has embalmed some reputations, and
has blasted others. It is the champion of the weak against the strong,
and has often illuminated for us, as in a flash, a glimpse of
character or custom that would otherwise have been lost to the world._

_There is only one similar collection of which I am aware, the "Jest
Book" by Mark Lemon, who was for twenty-nine years the editor of
"Punch." Alas that there should be fashions in jokes as well as in
hats, for much of his book that we know must have been humorous
reading to his contemporaries, leaves us, of the present generation in
America, indifferent._

_I shall be glad if some of my readers are minded to do a graceful act
and send me, in return, some paragraphs to add to my collection._

_I wish to take this opportunity to thank the following publications
for the paragraphs borrowed from their columns:_

AMONG THE HUMORISTS AND AFTER-DINNER SPEAKERS


There is a delicious flavor about this story of a Virginia lady,
married to a man who, though uniformly unsuccessful in his hunting
trips, boastingly spoke of his "killings."

One day, returning from a trip, with the usual accompaniment of an
empty bag, it occurred to him that his wife would make fun of him if
he returned without even one proof of his oft-boasted skill. So he
purchased a brace of partridges to deceive his trusting spouse. As he
threw them on the table in front of her, he observed: "Well, my dear,
you see I am not so awkward with the gun after all."

"Dick," replied the wife, turning from the birds with a grimace, after
a brief examination, "you were quite right in shooting these birds
to-day; to-morrow it would have been too late."

          *     *     *     *     *

Uncle Toby was aghast at finding a strange darky with his arm around
Mandy's waist.

"Mandy, tell dat niggah to take his ahm 'way from round yo' waist," he
indignantly commanded. "Tell him yo'self," said Mandy haughtily. "He's
a puffect stranger to me."

          *     *     *     *     *

A Cockney tourist was on a visit to a Highland town famous for its
golf-links. Through wearing a pair of stiff leather gaiters several
sizes too large for him, he was compelled to walk bow-legged. Being a
very slow player, others were forced to wait for him at every hole. At
the fourth hole a Highlander after watching the visitor miss the ball
three times was unable to wait any longer, and drove his ball clean
between the tourist's legs. "What!" he of the gaitered legs yelled
furiously. "Do you call that golf?" "Mebbe no," replied the Gael, "but
it's very good croquet."

          *     *     *     *     *

After the sermon on Sunday morning the rector welcomed and shook hands
with a young German.

"And are you a regular communicant?" said the rector.

"Yes," said the German, "I take the 7.45 every morning."

          *     *     *     *     *

Meeting a negro, a certain Southern gentleman asked him how he was
getting on.

The negro assumed a troubled look, and replied:

"Oh, so far's physicality goes, I'm all right; but I sure do have ma
troubles wif ma wife."

"Well, Sam, I'm sorry to hear that. What seems to be the matter?"

"She thinks money grows on trees, I reckon. All de time she keeps
pesterin' me foh pinch o' change. If it ain't a dollah it's half or a
quarter she wants."

"What on earth does she do with the money?"

"I dunno. Ain't nevah give her none yet."

          *     *     *     *     *

A mountaineer of one of the back counties of North Carolina was
arraigned with several others for illicit distilling. "Defendant,"
said the court, "what is your name?"

"Joshua," was the reply.

"Are you the man who made the sun stand still?"

Quick as a flash came the answer, "No, sir; I am the man who made the
moonshine."

          *     *     *     *     *

"They thought more of the Legion of Honor in the time of the first
Napoleon than they do now," said a well-known Frenchman. "The emperor
one day met an old one-armed veteran.

"'How did you lose your arm?' he asked.

"'Sire, at Austerlitz.'

"'And were you not decorated?'

"'No, sire.'

"'Then here is my own cross for you; I make you chevalier.'

"'Your Majesty names me chevalier because I have lost one arm! What
would your Majesty have done had I lost both arms?'

"'Oh, in that case I should have made you Officer of the Legion.'

"Whereupon the old soldier immediately drew his sword and cut off his
other arm."

There is no particular reason to doubt this story. The only question
is, how did he do it?

          *     *     *     *     *

A stranger in Boston was interested to discover, when dining with
friends once, that the dessert he would have classed as cream layer
cake at home was known in Boston as "Washington pie." And the next
time he lunched at a restaurant, he ordered the same thing; but the
waiter put before him a rather heavy looking square of cake covered
with chocolate, instead of the cream cake the guest had made up his
mind to enjoy. A puzzled expression came over his face as he said
reprovingly, "I ordered _Washington_ pie, waiter."

"That is Washington pie, sir."

"Well," expostulated the disappointed man, "I did not mean Booker
T.--I want _George!_"

          *     *     *     *     *

George Ade, automobiling in Indiana, dined at a country hotel among a
roomful of ministers.

The ministers, who were holding a convention in the town, were much
amused when Mr. Ade's identity was disclosed to them.

One of them said during dinner:

"How does a humorist of your stamp feel, sir, in such reverend company
as this?"

"I feel," said Mr. Ade promptly, "like a lion in a den of Daniels."

          *     *     *     *     *

It was a crowded tram car. Among those who could not find seats was a
young lady. Close to where she stood an old man was sitting. He
struggled as if to rise. The young woman cast a glance of scorn at one
or two men hiding behind newspapers. "Please don't get up," she said
to the old man, "I beg you won't." The conductor rang the bell and the
car went on. The old man's features worked convulsively and he mopped
his face with his handkerchief. At the next stopping place he again
tried to rise and again the young woman tried to stop him. "I would
much rather stand," she said, continuing to block his way. "I don't
care whether you would or not," said the old man, crimson with fury,
"I want to get out. You've made me come half a mile too far already.
Here, you, stop the car." But it was too late, the bell had already
rung and he had to wait until the next stopping place was reached.

          *     *     *     *     *

"I want some cigars for my husband for Christmas."

"What kind, madam?"

"Well, I don't know, exactly; but he is a middle-aged man and always
dresses in black."

          *     *     *     *     *

John D. Rockefeller, Jr., tells a story of his father:

"Father tells many stories. Sometimes he tells a new one. Not long ago
he related one to me that concerned a man who had imbibed rather too
freely. The man, in this condition, fell into a watering trough. To
the officer who came to help him out as he wallowed in the water, he
said:

"'Offzer, I ken save self. You save women an' shildern.'"

"On Sunday, September 20, the wife of ---- of a daughter. Others
please copy."

Bret Harte was so frequently complimented as the author of "Little
Breeches" that he was almost as sorry it was ever written as was
Colonel John Hay, who preferred his fame to rest on more ambitious
works. A gushing lady who prided herself upon her literary tastes,
said to him once: "My dear Mr. Harte, I am so delighted to meet you. I
have read everything you ever wrote, but of all your dialect verse
there is none that compares to your 'Little Breeches.'"

"I quite agree with you, madam," said Mr. Harte, "but you have put the
little breeches on the wrong man."

          *     *     *     *     *

Mr. Knox, the Secretary of State in Taft's Cabinet, was formerly
engaged in the practise of law in Pittsburg.

One day, says a friend, Mr. Knox was much put out to find on his
arrival at his office that everything was topsy-turvy and that the
temperature of his rooms was much too low for comfort. Summoning his
office-boy, a lad but recently entered his employ, the lawyer asked
who had raised every window in the place on such a cold morning.

"Mr. Muldoon, sir," was the answer.

"Who is Mr. Muldoon?" asked the attorney.

"The janitor, sir."

"Who carried off my waste-basket?" was the next question.

"Mr. Reilly, sir."

"And who is Mr. Reilly?"

"He's the man that cleans the rooms."

Mr. Knox looked sternly at the boy and said: "See here, Richard, we
call men by their first names here. We don't 'mister' them in this
office. Do you understand?"

"Yes, sir." And the boy retired.

In a few minutes he reappeared and in a shrill, piping voice
announced:

"There's a gentleman that wants to see you, Philander."

          *     *     *     *     *

A Scottish parson, still on the under side of forty, was driving home
from an outlying hamlet when he overtook a young woman. He recognized
her as the maid of all work at a farm which he would pass, so he
pulled up and offered her a lift. Mary gladly accepted his offer and
they chatted pleasantly all the way to the farm gate.

"Thank you, sir," she said as she got down.

"Don't mention it, Mary. Don't mention it," he told her politely.

"No, I won't," Mary obligingly assured him.

          *     *     *     *     *

A little girl was shown her newly-arrived baby brother. Looking at him
lovingly she said, "When will he talk, mother?" "Oh not for a long
time yet," said the mother. "Yes, but when?" persisted the child.
"Well, not for a year or so." After thinking for minute the child
exclaimed, "How funny. Miss Clark read out of the Bible this morning
that Job cursed the hour he was born."

          *     *     *     *     *

W. A. Sponsler, when in the Pennsylvania State Legislature, was given
to the making of very elaborate and florid speeches, and one day
brought an address to a close with "_Vox populi, vox Dei_."

"I'll bet you don't know the meaning of what Sponsler just said," said
Al Crawford to Hugh E. Mackin.

"I don't know!" replied Mackin, indignantly. "Of course, I know!"

"You don't know for ten dollars!" suggested Crawford.

Mackin, still indignant, posted his part of the wager with another
member of the Legislature, and Crawford said tauntingly:

"Well, now, tell us, what does it mean?"

"_Vox populi, vox Dei_," quoted Mackin, solemnly, "as everybody knows,
is French for 'My God! why hast thou forsaken me?'"

"Give him the money," said Crawford. "Darned if he don't know after
all!"

There is an old lady living in a small town in southern Pennsylvania
who makes great efforts to keep abreast of the times. Her
opportunities, however, are circumscribed, and she is sometimes
compelled to resort to her imagination. She went to a church sociable
lately, and as she entered the room one of the attendants said:

"Good evening, auntie. I am glad you came. We are going to have
tableaux this evening."

"Yes, I know," replied the old lady; "I smelt 'em when I first came
in."

          *     *     *     *     *

Fifer was a dog of friendly and social habits, but when he wandered
into the lecture-tent at a well-known New Thought summer school and
went to sleep between the chairs, he did a very foolish thing. A woman
coming in poked him in the ribs with her parasol, startling him from
his peaceful dreams, and he sprang upon her with a savage bite. A man
grabbed him and he grabbed the man. The excitement was intense when an
earnest little woman standing on a chair cried, "Some one hold the
Thought!" "Hang the Thought!" shouted a man in the rear. "Some one
hold the dog!"

          *     *     *     *     *

The boy was going away to school, full of high hope.

"I shall make the football team and color two pipes the first year!"
he said bravely.

His mother kissed him and wept. His father wrung his hand in silence.

They were too full for speech then.

But when he was gone, and they were calmer, they talked together of
him, and prayed his ambition might not carry him beyond his strength.

The car was entirely empty with the exception of one man, but as I
entered he rose, made me an unsteady but magnificent bow, and said:
"Madam, pleashe be kind 'nough to asshept thish plashe."

There was nothing else for me to do, so I thanked him and sat down.
And for twenty blocks that idiot hung from a strap, swaying in the
breeze, with not a soul in the car but ourselves. Occasionally I have
been taken for other women; but I never before had any one think that
I was a carful.

Husband (after the theater)--"Well, how do you like the piece?"

Wife--"Very much. There's only one improbable thing in it. The second
act takes place two years after the first, and they have the same
servant."

          *     *     *     *     *

Thomas Hill (the original "Paul Pry") was endeavoring one evening to
cut up an orange in such a fashion as to represent a pig. After
strewing the table with about a dozen peels, he gave up the futile
experiment, saying, "Hang the pig! I can't make him at all."

"Nonsense, Hill," said Theodore Hook, pointing to the table; "you have
done splendidly. Instead of a pig you have made a litter."

An elderly churchwarden in shaving himself one Sunday before
church-time made a slight cut with the razor on the extreme end of his
nose. Quickly calling to his wife, he asked her if she had any
court-plaster in the house. "You will find some in my sewing basket,"
she said. The warden soon had the cut covered. At church in assisting
with the collection he noticed everyone smile as he passed the plate,
and some of the younger people laughed outright. Very much annoyed, he
asked a friend if there was anything wrong with his appearance.
"Well, I should think there is," was the answer. "What is that on your
nose?" "Court-plaster." "No," said his friend, "it is the label from a
reel of cotton. It says, 'Warranted 200 yd. long.'"

A man who stuttered very badly went to a specialist, and after ten
difficult lessons learned to say quite distinctly, "Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers." His friends congratulated him upon this
splendid achievement.

"Yes," said the man, doubtfully, "but it's s-s-such a d-d-deucedly
d-d-d-difficult rem-mark to w-work into an ordin-n-nary
c-c-convers-s-sa-tion, y' know."

A visitor to a Sunday-school was asked to address a few remarks to the
children. He took the familiar theme of the children who mocked Elisha
on his journey to Bethel--how the youngsters taunted the poor old
prophet and how they were punished when two she bears came out of the
wood and ate forty-and-two of them. "And now, children," said he,
wishing to learn if his talk had produced any moral effect, "what does
this story show?" "Please, sir," came from a little girl well down in
the front, "it shows how many children two she bears can hold."

A curate who had left his parish on account of the attentions of his
lady parishioners, meeting his successor one day in the street asked
him how he got on in his new position. "Very well indeed," returned
the other. "But are not the ladies rather pressing in their
attentions?" "Oh, my dear fellow, I manage that all right, I find
safety in Numbers." "I see," returned his companion, "well, I found
safety in Exodus."

"I want some collars for my husband," said a lady in a department
store, "but I am afraid I have forgotten the size."

"Thirteen and a half, ma'am?" suggested the clerk.

"That's it. How on earth did you know?"

"Gentlemen who let their wives buy their collars for 'em are almost
always about that size, ma'am," explained the observant clerk.

On a recent occasion before leaving Marlborough House new clothes were
ordered for Prince Edward, and according to custom a tailoress was
sent to fit him at a time which would not interfere with his lessons.
The tailoress duly arrived and was ushered to the Prince's
sitting-room, but on the door being opened she paused as she saw that
a gentleman, whose face was turned toward the fireplace, was sitting
smoking and chatting with the children. Prince Edward, whose manner is
most friendly, at once ran forward and told her to come in, and seeing
that she still hesitated added in a reassuring voice, "You needn't
mind, it's only grandpapa."

A physician engaged a nurse, recently graduated, for a case of
delirium tremens. The physician succeeded in quieting his patient and
left some medicine, instructing the nurse to administer it to him if
he "began to see snakes again." At the next call the physician found
the patient again raving. To his puzzled inquiry the nurse replied
that the man had been going on that way for several hours, and that
she had not given him any medicine.

"But didn't I tell you to give it to him if he began to see snakes
again?" asked the physician.

"But he didn't see snakes this time," replied the nurse confidently.
"He saw red, white, and blue turkeys with straw hats on."

Shortly after his entrance into political life Disraeli stood for a
certain Middlesex borough in the Conservative interest. It was a
"personally conducted" canvass, and, among others, the future Prime
Minister solicited the vote and interest of a well-to-do but somewhat
irascible farmer, who was supposed to be rather doubtful in his
political convictions.

"Vote for you!" he shouted when Mr. Disraeli made known the object of
his call. "Why, I'd vote for the devil sooner."

"Ah, quite so!" said Mr. Disraeli, suavely, "but in event of your
friend not standing, may I hope for your interest?"

An ambitious youth once sent his first MS. to Dumas, asking the
distinguished novelist to become his _collaborateur_. The latter was
astounded at the impertinence. Angrily seizing his pen, he wrote: "How
dare you, sir, yoke together a noble horse and a contemptible ass?"

He received the following reply:

"How dare you sir, call me a horse?"

His anger vanished and he laughingly penned the following:

"Send on your MS., my friend; I gladly accept your proposition."

A young woman was in company with a university graduate, and naturally
the talk ran upon books. By and by there was a lull in the

"Oh," was the answer, "fielding is important, of course; but it isn't
worth much unless you have good pitching and batting."

General Frederick D. Grant said to his servant one morning: "James, I
have left my mess boots out. I want them soled."

"Yes, sir," the servant answered.

The general, dressing for dinner that night, said again:

"I suppose, James, that you did as I told you about those boots?"

James laid thirty-five cents on the bureau.

"Yes, sir," said he, "and this is all I could get for them, though the
corporal who bought 'em said he'd have given half a dollar if pay day
hadn't been so far off."

President Lincoln once wrote to General McClellan, when the latter was
in command of the army. General McClellan, as is well known, conducted
a waiting campaign, being so careful not to make any mistakes that he
made very little headway. President Lincoln sent this brief but
exceedingly pertinent letter:

"_My dear McClellan_: If you don't want to use the army I should like
to borrow it for a while.

    "Yours respectfully,

It was at a children's party in West Kensington. The youngsters had
just done more than justice to the luxurious spread provided by their
hostess, and games were now the order of the evening.

"Now, children," said she, "we will play the zoo, and each of you must

"And what are you going to be, Tommy?"

"P-please," was the halting reply, "p-please--I'm going--to be sick."

A well-known New York clergyman was telling his Bible class the story
of the Prodigal Son at a recent session, and wishing to emphasize the
disagreeable attitude of the elder brother on that occasion, he laid
especial stress on this phase of the parable. After describing the
rejoicing of the household over the return of the wayward son, he
spoke of one who, in the midst of the festivities, failed to share in
the jubilant spirit of the occasion.

"Can anybody in the class," he asked, "tell me who this was?"

A clever veterinary has a system all his own. When he received an
overfed toy dog he would consign him to a disused brick oven, with a
crust of bread, an onion and an old boot. When the dog began to gnaw
the bread, the anxious mistress was informed that her darling was
"doing nicely." When it commenced operation on the onion, word was
sent that the pet was "decidedly better"; but when the animal tackled
the boot, my lady was gratified to hear that her precious pet was
"ready to be removed."

animal to harm them, but the boy, remembering a previous encounter
with a goat, in which he came out second best, did not grow any
braver.

The temperance society was to meet that afternoon. Mrs. Philpots
dressed in a hurry and came panting downstairs. She was a short, plump
woman.

"Addie, run up to my room and get my blue ribbon rosette, the
temperance badge," she directed her maid. "I have forgotten it. You
will know it, Addie--blue ribbon and gold lettering."

"Yas'm, I knows it right well." Addie could not read, but she knew a
blue ribbon with gold lettering when she saw it, and therefore had no
trouble in finding it and fastening it properly on the dress of her
mistress.

Mrs. Philpots was too busy greeting her friends or giving close

with the then Prince of Wales, now King Edward. Among the courses was
one of asparagus, a delicacy unknown to the Shah. He considered it for
a time, discovered that the head alone was nice to eat, ate it
accordingly and flung the rest of the stalk over his shoulder. The
other diners were somewhat flabbergasted, but the tactful Prince, not

"Possibly you may not have heard this anecdote concerning him. John

sat down, listened to her story, and felt her pulse. He found he was
not up to his work. He lost his wits and in a moment of forgetfulness
exclaimed, "Drunk, by Jove!" Still he managed to write out a mild
prescription. Early next morning he received a message from the noble
patient to call on her at once. Dr. Fordyce felt very uncomfortable.
The lady evidently intended to upbraid him either for giving an
improper prescription or for his disgraceful condition, but to his
surprise and relief she thanked him for his prompt compliance with her
pressing summons, and then confessed that he had rightly diagnosed her
case. That unfortunately she occasionally indulged too freely in
drink, but that she hoped he would preserve inviolable secrecy as to
the condition in which he had found her. Fordyce listened to her as
grave as a judge, then said:

"Madam, you may depend on me. I shall be as silent as the grave."

A friend of Dean Swift one day sent him a turbot as a present by a
servant lad who had frequently been on similar errands but had never
received anything from the dean for his trouble. Having gained
admission he opened the study door, and putting down the fish on the
floor cried out rudely, "Master has sent you a turbot." "Young man,"
said the dean rising from the chair, "is that the way you deliver a
message? Let me teach you better manners. Sit down in my chair; we
will change places, and I will show you how to behave in future." The
boy sat down, and the dean going out came up to the door, and making a
low bow said, "Sir, master presents his kind compliments, hopes you
are well, and requests your acceptance of a small present." "Does he?"
replied the boy. "Return him my best thanks, and there's half-a-crown
for yourself." The dean thus caught in his own trap laughed heartily
and gave the boy a crown for his ready wit.

"I ought not to be surprised by anything at my time of life," said a
well-known minister, "but one of my flock did manage to take my breath
away. I was preaching about the Father's tender wisdom in caring for
us all," he said. "I illustrated by saying that the Father knows which
of us grows best in sunlight and which of us must have shade. 'You
know you plant roses in the sunshine,' I said, 'and heliotrope and
geraniums; but if you want your fuchsias to grow they must be kept in
a shady nook.' After the sermon, which I hoped would be a comforting
one, a woman came up to me, her face glowing with pleasure that was
evidently deep and true. 'O, Dr. ----, I am so grateful for that
sermon,' she said, clasping my hand and shaking it warmly. My heart
glowed for a moment, while I wondered what tender place in her heart
and life I had touched. Only for a moment, though. 'Yes,' she went on,
fervently, 'I never knew before what was the matter with my
fuchsias.'"

There are some singular discounts allowed in the book trade. They were
happily illustrated on one occasion by Mark Twain. One day while the
humorist was connected with a publishing house he went into a book
store and picking up a volume asked the price. He then suggested that
as a publisher he was entitled to 50 per cent discount. To this the
clerk assented.

"As I am also an author," said Mark, "it would appear that I am again
entitled to 50 per cent discount."

Again the clerk bowed.

"And as a personal friend of the proprietor," he modestly continued,
"I presume that you will allow me the usual 25 per cent. discount."

Another bow from the salesman.

"Well," drawled the unblushing humorist, "under these conditions I
think I may as well take the book. What's the tax?"

The clerk took out his pencil and figured industriously. Then he said
with the greatest obsequiousness:

"As near as I can calculate we owe you the book and about 37-1/2
cents."

Clyde Fitch tells a new story of Whistler. The artist was in Paris at
the time of the coronation of King Edward, and at a reception one
evening a duchess said to him: "I believe you know King Edward, Mr.
Whistler."

"No, madame," replied Whistler.

"Why, that's odd," she murmured; "I met the King at a dinner-party
last year, and he said that he knew you."

"Oh," said the painter, "that was just his brag."

A London friend who was a member of the same club as Mr. Whistler
writes me this, which I have not seen before in print. It seems that
the gentle artist in making enemies had not paid his dues and was
dunned for them in vain. He either took no notice of requests for a
settlement, or replied to them with his usual airy mockery. Finally
the secretary wrote to him:

_"Dear Mr. Whistler_--It is not a Nocturne in Purple, or a Symphony in
Blue and Gray, that we are after, but An Arrangement in Gold and
Silver."

This drew forth the required pounds and shillings.

Here is another story typical of the great maker of enemies:

Whistler had a French poodle of which he was extravagantly fond. The
poodle was seized with an affection of the throat, and Whistler had
the audacity to send for the great throat specialist Mackenzie.

Sir Morell, when he saw that he had been called in to treat a dog,
didn't like it much, it was plain. But he said nothing. He prescribed,
pocketed a big fee, and drove away.

The next day he sent post-haste for Whistler; and Whistler, thinking
he was summoned on some matter connected with his beloved dog, dropped
his work and rushed like the wind to Mackenzie's.

On his arrival Sir Morell said gravely:

"How do you do, Mr. Whistler? I wanted to see you about having my
front door painted."

A story is told of a very popular cavalry officer. He was being tried
for drunkenness, and among other witnesses was his Irish orderly. The
court, anxious to give the officer every chance, put several questions
to this witness with a view of eliciting any facts that might be in
his master's favor. When the orderly said that his master, on going to
bed, had expressed a wish to be called early, the members of the
court-martial were distinctly pleased.

A man who gave special instructions to be called early could not,
surely--they argued to themselves--have been drunk. Hoping to get
favorable particulars, the judge advocate put a further question.

"And why did the major wish to be called early?" he asked.

"Faith, an' he tould me it was because he was to be Queen of the May,"
came the answer.

That settled it.

Somebody told Mr. Jenks that red flannel worn next to the skin would
cure the rheumatism from which he suffered. So he purchased several
sets of red flannel undergarments. The clerk assured him that the firm
guaranteed the goods in every particular. About two months later, says
the New York "Times," Mr. Jenks revisited the shop, sought out the
proprietor and told his woful story.

"The goods are the best in the house," declared the proprietor. "Of
course," he said, in a reasonable tone used on unreasonable persons,
"of course the shirts may have shrunk or faded a little--"

"Shrunk! Faded!" bellowed Mr. Jenks. "What do you think my wife said
to me, when I came down to breakfast yesterday with one of them on?"

The proprietor looked bored.

They were newly married and on a honeymoon trip. They put up at a
skyscraper hotel. The bridegroom felt indisposed, and the bride said
she would slip out and do a little shopping.

In due time she returned and tripped blithely up to her room, a little
awed by the number of doors that looked all alike. But she was sure of
her own and tapped gently on the panel.

"I'm back, honey; let me in," she whispered.

No answer.

"Honey, honey, let me in!" she called again, rapping louder. Still no

eyes. "Talk," she said eagerly, "our baby talk? Well, I guess he can.
He's three months younger than my cousin's boy and he's a year ahead

say things, and when you hear them you have to work hard with your
imagination to tell what they're saying.

"Now, there's my cousin's baby--the one I spoke of. They declare that
child has a vocabulary of fifteen words, but, my dear, if you could
hear him. He says 'bay' for bread, and 'flis' for fish, and 'cang' for
candle, and 'hort' for horse, and 'apa' for father. Now I'll try
Harold with those very words, and you'll see the difference.

"Say bread, Harold--bread--bre-e-ad."

"Now say fish, fi-sh."

"Woss," said the baby.

"And now will precious say father, fa-ather, fa-a-ar-ther?"

"Wahwah," said the baby.

was a member, held a reunion the chief feature of which was a banquet.
During the banquet the various heads of the different families of
Potters arose and gave a short account of the pedigrees and deeds of
their ancestors and each head seemed to be able to demonstrate that
their branch was the oldest and most renowned. After all the speakers

"You had better take them, sir," persisted the clerk; "we redeem them

give a grand piano."

whisky or smoked enough of your cigars to get a thousand of those

A Southern lawyer tells of a case that came to him at the outset of
his career, wherein his principal witness was a darky named Jackson,
supposed to have knowledge of certain transactions not at all to the
credit of his employer, the defendant.

"Now, Jackson," said the lawyer, "I want you to understand the
importance of telling the truth when you are put on the stand. You
know what will happen, don't you, if you don't tell the truth?"

"Yassir," was Jackson's reply; "in dat case I expects our side will
win de case."

A small boy who had recently passed his fifth birthday was riding in a
suburban car with his mother, when they were asked the customary
question, "How old is the boy?" After being told the correct age,
which did not require a fare, the conductor passed on to the next
person.

The boy sat quite still as if pondering over some question, and then,
concluding that full information had not been given, called loudly to
the conductor, then at the other end of the car: "And mother's
thirty-one!"

One of the uptown banks, on a conspicuous corner, gained a bad name
with the daily crowd of New York pedestrians. Its financial standing
was of course beyond question, but its clock ran on a very eccentric
and confusing system. The timepiece stood in a spot easily observable
and was consulted for years in spite of its tendency to wander from
strict accuracy. A woman excusing her lateness for luncheon said she
thought she was on time by the clock in the bank.

"Oh, nobody can go by that," said her companion contemptuously. "We
call that the bank where the wild time grows."

A prominent railroad man hurried down the lobby of a Binghamton hotel
and up to the desk. He had just ten minutes in which to pay his bill
and reach the station. Suddenly it occurred to him that he had
forgotten something.

"Here, boy," he called to a negro bellboy, "run up to 48 and see if I
left a box on the bureau. And be quick about it, will you?"

The boy rushed up the stairs. The ten minutes dwindled to seven and
the railroad man paced the office. At length the boy appeared.

"Yas, suh," he panted breathlessly. "Yas, suh, yo' left it, suh!"

"Are you going to eat it?" the minister asked.

"No, sir; it's too pretty to eat. I'm going to keep it," the little

When Blaine was a young lawyer, and cases were few, he was asked to
defend a poverty-stricken tramp accused of stealing a watch. He
pleaded with all the ardor at his command, drawing so pathetic a
picture with such convincing energy that at the close of his argument
the court was in tears and even the tramp wept. The jury deliberated
but a few minutes and returned the verdict "not guilty." Then the
tramp drew himself up, tears streaming down his face as he looked at
the future "Plumed Knight," and said: "Sir, I have never heard so
grand a plea, I have not cried before since I was a child. I have no
money with which to reward you, but (drawing a package from the depths
of his ragged clothes), here's that watch; take it and welcome."

The other day an ingenious-looking person called with the message to
the housewife that her husband had sent him for his dress suit, which
was to be pressed and redone by the tailor.

"Dear me," said the housewife, "he said nothing to me about it. Did he
look quite well?"

"Yes, mum; he wuz in good health and spirits."

"And he seemed quite as if he knew what he was about?"

"He did that, mum."

"And did he look as if he were quite content with things about him?"

"He was all that, mum."

"Well," said the lady, "it seems strange that he should only think of
that dress suit now, because it's ten years since he's dead and
buried, and I've often wondered how he's been getting on."

Dr. Jowett of Oxford was a formidable wit. At a gathering at which he
was present the talk ran upon the comparative gifts of two Balliol men
who had been made respectively a judge and a bishop. Prof. Henry
Smith, famous in his day for his brilliancy, pronounced the bishop to
be the greater man of the two for this reason: "A judge, at the most,
can only say, 'You be hanged,' whereas a bishop can say, 'You be
damned!'"

"Yes," said Dr. Jowett, but if the judge says, "'You be hanged,' you
_are_ hanged."

No amount of persuasion or punishment could keep Johnnie from running
away. The excitement of being pursued and of being brought back to a
tearful family appealed to his sense of the dramatic and offset the
slight discomfort that sometimes followed.

Finally his mother determined upon a new method. She decided, after
many misgivings, that the next time Johnnie ran away no notice
whatever should be taken of it. He should stay away as long as he
pleased and return when he saw fit.

In a few days the youngster again disappeared. His mother was firm in
her resolve and no search was made. Great was poor Johnnie's
disappointment. He managed to stay away all day, but when it began to
grow dark his courage failed and he started for home. He sneaked
ignominiously into the kitchen. Nobody spoke to him. Apparently his
absence had not been noticed. This was too much. As soon as
opportunity offered he remarked casually, "Well, I see you've got the
same old cat."

naturalist. They slew a centipede, glued on it a beetle's head, and
also added to its body the wings of a butterfly and the long legs of a
grasshopper. Then they put the new insect in a box and knocked at the

A bride and groom had been much troubled by the stares of people at
hotels wherever they went. So when they arrived at the next hotel the
groom called the colored head-waiter.

"Now, George," he said, "we have been bothered to death by people
staring at us because we are just married. We want to be free from
that sort of thing here. Now, here's two dollars, and remember I trust
you not to tell people that we are just married, if they ask you.
Understand?"

"Yas, sah!" said George; "I un'stand."

All went well that day. But the following morning when the couple came
down to breakfast the staring was worse than ever. Chambermaids in the
hall snickered; the clerks behind the desk nudged each other;
everybody in the dining-room stared. When the couple returned to their
room it was only to see a head sticking out of nearly every room down
the long hall.

This was too much.

This _was_ the limit!

Angered beyond control, the groom went to the desk and called for the
head-waiter.

"Look here, you old fool," said the groom, "didn't I give you two
dollars to protect my wife and myself from the staring business?"

"Yas, sah, you did," said George. "'Pon me soul, I didn't tell, sah."

"Then how about this staring?" asked the irate groom. "It's worse here
than anywhere. Did anybody ask if we were married?"

shooting in 1873 with old Emperor William of Germany and Victor
Emmanuel. The three monarchs got separated from their party and lost
their way. They were drenched to the skin, and, in search of shelter,
hailed a peasant driving a covered cart drawn by oxen along the high
road. The peasant took up the royal trio and drove on.

"And who may you be, for you are a stranger in these parts?" he asked,
after a while, of Emperor William.

"I am the Emperor of Germany," replied his Teutonic majesty.

"Ha, very good," said the peasant, and then, addressing Victor
Emmanuel, "and you, my friend?"

"Why, I am the King of Italy," came the prompt reply.

"Ha, ha, very good, indeed! And who are you?" addressing Francis
Joseph.

"I am the Emperor of Austria," said the latter.

The peasant then scratched his head and said with a knowing wink:
"Very good, and who do you suppose I am?"

Their majesties replied they would like very much to know.

"Why, I am his Holiness the Pope."

Mrs. Gilroy, prominent in the church work of her small city, had
acquired a new servant, willing but ignorant.

"Bridget," she said, "I am going to lie down and do not wish to be
disturbed. If any one calls, do not say I am not at home, but give an
evasive answer."

"What's that, mum?" said Bridget.

Having explained as well as she could, the good lady retired and later
appeared below stairs, much refreshed.

"Did any one call?" she asked.

"Yes, mum; the new minister, from your church."

"Oh, Bridget. What did you tell him?"

"Well," sez he, "is Mrs. Gilroy at home?" and I sez nuthin', and sez
he a little louder, "Is Mrs. Gilroy at home?" and sez I, "Was your
grandmother a monkey?"

A young kindergarten teacher, of Manhattan, who is made much of by her
pupils--frequently meeting their parents--has a very affable manner,
and, on entering a Broadway car recently, exclaimed in her most
cordial way to one of the passengers: "Why, how do you do, Mr. Brown!"
As the man addressed evidently did not know her and looked rather
dazed, she saw her mistake and hurriedly apologized, saying: "Oh, I
beg your pardon-I thought you were the father of one of my children."

Then every one within hearing looked so amused that the young lady
left the car at the next stop.

A Mr. Johnson, of Boston, was the owner of a small yacht, in which he
took much pleasure during the summer, cruising along the coast.

He had for a cook a young fellow from Denmark whose English was not
always perfect, but who made himself so generally useful that Mr.
Johnson kept him for several years at good wages. One summer they
landed at a place where a camp-meeting was in full blast. Our friend,
the Dane, was greatly interested and took a front seat.

Near the close of the meeting one of the brethren went about among the
people exhorting them to "go forward." Coming to the Dane, he said,
"My friend, don't you want to work for Jesus?"

"No," said the Dane, "I've got a good yob with Yohnson."

A man returned home late one night after having partaken rather freely
of the "cup that cheers." All might have been well had not one tree
intercepted between him and his destination--one solitary tree at the
foot of his own steps; but Mr. B---- suddenly came into such forcible
contact with that tree that he was almost stunned. After recovering
his senses, he wandered about, but repeatedly bumped into the same
inoffensive barrier. At length he sank down on the ground and muttered
helplessly:

"Lost! Lost! in an impenetrable forest!"

"Curse it!" he moaned, sinking to the ground in despair. "Locked in!"

Stanley, aged four, was one of a large family. Besides numerous
sisters and brothers, there were aunts and uncles galore and many

They had just met; conversation was somewhat fitful. Finally he
decided to guide it into literary channels, where he was more at home,
and, turning to his companion, asked:

"Are you fond of literature?"

"Passionately," she replied. "I love books dearly."

"Then you must admire Sir Walter Scott," he exclaimed with sudden
animation. "Is not his 'Lady of the Lake' exquisite in its flowing
grace and poetic imagery? Is it not--"

"It is perfectly lovely," she assented, clasping her hands in ecstasy.
"I suppose I have read it a dozen times."

"And Scott's 'Marmion,'" he continued, "with its rugged simplicity and
marvelous description--one can almost smell the heather on the heath
while perusing its splendid pages."

"It is perfectly grand," she murmured.

"And Scott's 'Peveril of the Peak' and his noble 'Bride of
Lammermoor'--where in the English language will you find anything more
heroic than his grand auld Scottish characters and his graphic,
forceful pictures of feudal times and customs? You like them, I am
sure."

"I just dote upon them," she replied.

"And Scott's Emulsion," he continued hastily, for a faint suspicion
was beginning to dawn upon him.

wrote."

every time he came to a period she would say "Amen!" or some other
pious exclamation. The people in the audience, which was composed
mostly of the village church members, knew she was being reverent and
did not even smile when she exclaimed, until finally the lecturer
mentioned some far-off city in China, saying, "I live there." At this
point clearly and distinctly could be heard the old lady, saying,
"Thank God for that."

Ralph Waldo Emerson, like other men of genius, was absent-minded, and,
when a fit of inspiration seized him, he was oblivious to the things
of earth to a ludicrous extent. A story that is vouched for as true
illustrates this.

The old-fashioned matches, in use in New England in Emerson's time,
were made in cards, or flat slabs, the matches being joined at the
foot, and separating at the top, like the teeth of a deep comb.
Emerson was accustomed, in the midnight watches, to lie awake
communing with his own thoughts, and, if any especial inspiration
developed itself, he would get up and write it down, lighting the lamp
for that purpose.

One night, Mrs. Emerson was awakened by her gifted husband's voice, as
he called to her plaintively:

"What is the matter with the matches, my dear? I have struck seven,
and not one will light. Where can I get some good ones?"

Mrs. Emerson got out of bed at once, and found the matches in their
accustomed place. Her husband had not touched them.

"Why, what can you have been striking, in mistake for matches?" she
asked, anxiously, and beheld her best carved tortoise-shell comb,
which the absorbed philosopher, had broken up, tooth by tooth, in
mistake for the card of matches.

"I confess that the subject of psychical research makes no great
appeal to me," Sir William Henry Perkin, the inventor of coal-tar

fairly long career, I have heard at first hand but one ghost story.
Its hero was a man whom I may as well call Snooks.

"Snooks, visiting at a country house, was put in the haunted chamber
for the night. He said that he did not feel the slightest uneasiness,
but nevertheless, just as a matter of precaution, he took to bed with
him a revolver of the latest American pattern.

"He slept peacefully enough until the clock struck two, when he awoke
with an unpleasant feeling of oppression. He raised his head and
peered about him. The room was wanly illumined by the full moon, and
in that weird, bluish light he thought he discerned a small, white
hand clasping the rail at the foot of the bed.

"'Who's there?' he asked tremulously.

"There was no reply. The small, white hand did not move.

"'Who's there?' he repeated. 'Answer me or I'll shoot.'

"Again there was no reply.

"Snooks cautiously raised himself, took careful aim and fired.

"From that night on he's limped. Shot off two of his own toes."

Chautauqua to lecture on "Fools," Bishop Vincent introduced him thus:

"Ladies and gentlemen, we are now to have a lecture on 'Fools' by one

Here there was a long pause, the Bishop's inflection indicating that
he had finished. The audience roared with delight, and roared again,
so that it was some time before the sentence was concluded--"men of
Chicago."

Dr. Henson, who is a man of ready wit, stepped to the front of the
platform, and said:

"Ladies and gentlemen, I am not so great a fool as Bishop Vincent----"
and then he paused as if he had finished, and the audience went fairly
wild over the situation. When quiet was restored, Dr. Henson

Every employee of the Bank of England is required to sign his name in
a book on his arrival in the morning, and, if late, must give the
reason therefor. The chief cause of tardiness is usually fog, and the

follow write "ditto." One day, however, the first late man gave as the
reason, "wife had twins," and twenty other late men mechanically
signed "ditto" underneath.

parishioner who had strayed from his own kirk.

"Why weren't you at the kirk on Sunday?" asked the preacher of the
culprit on meeting him a day or two later.

"I was at Mr. McClellan's kirk," said the other.

Perish the thought that the novelist or playwright should be tied down
to historical accuracy! Lady Dorothy Neville quotes an amusing
correspondence between Bulwer Lytton and her brother, Horace Walpole.

"My dear Walpole: Here I am at Bath--bored to death. I am thinking of
writing a play about your great ancestor Sir Robert. Had he not a
sister Lucy, and did she not marry a Jacobite?"

Walpole promptly replied:

"My dear Lytton: I care little for my family, and less still for Sir
Robert, but I know that he never had a sister Lucy, so she could not
have married a Jacobite."

However, this mattered little to Lord Lytton, for his answer ran:

"My dear Walpole: You are too late! Sir Robert _had_ a sister Lucy,
and she _did_ marry a Jacobite."

So in defiance of history, the play "Walpole" was written.

"The major shook his head.

"'Guess again,' he growled.

"'No.'

"'Maybe--' here the sentry laughed--'maybe you're the major himself?'

"'That's right. I am the major,' was the stern reply.

"The sentry scrambled to his feet.

"'Good gracious!' he exclaimed. 'Hold the pie, will you, while I

mother, but the caller tripped gaily away; she had not noticed the

was taken of his visits to the house of his sweetheart, summoned up
sufficient courage to address the fair one thus:

"Jean, I was here on Monday nicht."

"Ay, ye were that," replied she.

"An' I was here on Tuesday nicht."

"So ye were."

"An' I was here on Wednesday," continued the ardent youth.

"Ay, an' ye were on Thursday nicht an' a'."

"An' I was here last nicht."

"Weel," she says, "what if ye were?"

"An' I am here the nicht again."

"An' what about it even if ye came every nicht?"

"What about it, did ye say? Did ye no' begin to smell a rat?"

A stately and venerable professor one morning, being unable to attend
to his class on account of a cold, wrote on the blackboard:

"Dr. Dash, through indisposition, is unable to attend to his classes
to-day."

The students erased one letter in this notice, making it read:

"Dr. Dash, through indisposition, is unable to attend to his lasses
to-day."

But it happened a few minutes later that the professor returned for a
box he had forgotten. Amid a roar of laughter he detected the change
in his notice, and, approaching the blackboard, calmly erased one
letter in his turn.

Now the notice read:

"Dr. Dash, through indisposition, is unable to attend to his asses
to-day."

The man in the smoker was boasting of his unerring ability to tell
from a man's looks exactly what city he came from. "You, for example,"
he said to the man next to him, "you are from New Orleans?" He was
right.

"You, my friend," turning to the man on the other side of him, "I
should say you are from Chicago?" Again he was right.

The other two men got interested.

"And you are from Boston?" he asked the third man.

"That's right, too," said the New Englander.

"And you from Philadelphia, I should say?" to the last man.

"No, sir," answered the man with considerable warmth; "I've been sick
for three months: that's what makes me look that way!"

Five-year-old Nellie had been naughty all day. Finally her mama, a

Mr. Blaine used to tell this story: Once, in Dublin, toward the end of
the opera, Mephistopheles was conducting Faust through a trap-door
which represented the gates of hell. His majesty got through all

half-way in, and no squeezing would get him any farther. Suddenly an
Irishman in the gallery exclaimed devoutly: "Thank God! hell's full."

When Commissioner Allen had charge of the Patent Office in Washington
he was very punctilious about the respect due him and his position,
and demanded full tribute from everybody.

One day, as he was sitting at his desk, two men came in without
knocking or announcement and without removing their hats.

Allen looked up and impaled the intruders with his glittering eye.
"Gentlemen," he said severely, "who are visitors to this office to see

"Huh," replied one of the men, "we ain't visitors, and we don't give a

Secretary Knox tells a good story of the last fight the late Senator
Quay, of Pennsylvania, made in the Senate. Quay was working hard on
the Oklahoma Statehood Bill, obstructing legislation, when a scheme
was fixed up to get him away from the Senate for a time. Quay was very
fond of tarpon fishing and had a winter place in Florida. One
afternoon he received this telegram from a friend who thought the
Senator might be in better business than pottering around about new
States:

"Fishing never so good. Tarpon biting everywhere, sport magnificent;
come."

Quay read the telegram and smiled a little smile. Then he answered:

"Tarpon may be biting, but I am not.--M. S. Quay."

"Now, children," said the teacher, "I want each of you to think of
some animal or bird and try for the moment to be like the particular
one you are thinking about, and make the same kind of noises they are
in the habit of making."

Instantly the schoolroom became a menagerie. Lions roaring, dogs
barking, birds singing and twittering, cows lowing, calves bleating,
cats meowing, etc., all in an uproar and excitement--all with one
exception, off in a remote corner a little fellow was sitting
perfectly still, apparently indifferent and unmindful of the rest. The
teacher observing him, approached and said: "Waldo, why are you not
taking part with the other children?"

Waving her off with a deprecating hand and rebuking eyes he whispered:
"Sh-sh-sh, teacher! I'm a rooster, and I'm a-layin' a aig!"

"Now, my dear," said the husband, "I will put into practise what I

Then he slipped his watch into his vest pocket and walked with his

Expecting a visit from the superintendent of an adjacent Sunday-school
one Sunday afternoon, one enterprising teacher, anticipating the line
of questions which would be asked of the scholars selected a boy from
her class to answer each question. As she had figured it out, the
visitor would first ask the pupils the question, "Who made you?" and
the first pupil was, of course, to answer "God." The next question was
to be "Of what?" to which the answer was to be "Of the dust of the
earth." Unfortunately between the time that Sunday-school was called
to order and the visiting superintendent took the floor, the first
pupil was taken sick and obliged to go home. The teacher did not have
the opportunity to readjust her forces, and when the first question
was asked, the second boy thought it a good opportunity for him to get
in his answer and have it off his mind; so to the question, "Who made
you?" he answered, "Of the dust of the earth."

"Oh, no," said the visitor. "God made you."

"No, sir; He did not," said the youngster. "The little boy that God
made has gone home sick, and I am the dust of the earth."

shirts in a haberdasher's window, which for variety of sunset colors
far excelled a Turner landscape when the sun is red and low, and there
in the window in glaring green type a large sign read, 'Listen!'"

One of a party of gentlemen left his corner seat in an already crowded
railway car to go in search of something to eat, leaving a rug to
reserve his place. On returning he found that in spite of the rug and
the protests of his fellow passengers, the seat had been usurped by a
woman clad in handsome clothes. With flashing eyes she turned upon
him: "Do you know, sir, that I am one of the directors' wives?"
"Madam," he replied, "were you the director's only wife I should still
protest."

Mr. C., a distinguished lawyer of Boston, was on his way to Denver to
transact some important business. During the afternoon he noticed, in
the opposite section of the Pullman, a sweet-faced, tired-appearing
woman traveling with four small children. Being fond of children and
feeling sorry for the mother, he soon made friends with the little
ones.

Early the next morning he heard their eager questions and the patient
"Yes, dear," of the mother as she tried to dress them, and looking
out he saw a small white foot protruding beyond the opposite curtain.
Reaching across the aisle, he took hold of the large toe and began to
recite: "This little pig went to market; this little pig stayed at
home; this little pig had roast beef; this little pig had none; this
little pig cried wee wee all the way home." The foot was suddenly
withdrawn and a cold, quiet voice said: "That is quite sufficient,
thank you."

Mr. C. hastily withdrew to the smoker, where he remained until the
train arrived in Denver.

"I don't believe anybody will have you," said Miss Mabel, the

"Yes, they will; I'll make 'em," said Winnie. "I'm going to get
married and have _five_ children--two of 'em colored," thoughtfully,
"to do my work."

A reverend gentleman was addressing a Sunday-school class not long
ago, and was trying to enforce the doctrine that when people's hearts
were sinful they needed regulating. Taking out his watch, and holding
it up, he said:

"Now, here is my watch; suppose it doesn't keep good time--now goes
too fast, and now too slow--what shall I do with it?"

"Sell it," promptly replied a boy.

In her brougham, about to make a round of visits, she found she had

Uncle Harry was a bachelor and not fond of babies. Even winsome
four-year-old Helen failed to win his heart. Every one made too much
fuss over the youngster, Uncle Harry declared.

One day Helen's mother was called downstairs and with fear and
trembling asked Uncle Harry, who was stretched out on a sofa, if he
would keep his eye on Helen. Uncle Harry grunted "Yes," but never
stirred from his position--in truth his eyes were tight shut.

By-and-by wee Helen tiptoed over to the sofa and leaning over Uncle
Harry softly inquired:

"Feepy?"

"No," growled Uncle Harry.

"Tired?" ventured Helen.

"No," said her uncle.

"Sick?" further inquired Helen, with real sympathy in her voice.

"No," still insisted Uncle Harry.

"Dus' feel bum, hey?"

And that won the uncle!

A clergyman was very anxious to introduce some hymn-books into the
church, and arranged with his clerk that the latter was to give out
the notice immediately after the sermon. The clerk, however, had a
notice of his own to give out with reference to the baptism of
infants. Accordingly, at the close of the sermon he arose and
announced that "All those who have children whom they wish to have
baptized please send in their names at once to the clerk." The
clergyman, who was stone deaf, assumed that the clerk was giving out
the hymn-book notice, and immediately rose and said: "And I should
say, for the benefit of those who haven't any, that they may obtain
some from the ushers any day from three to four o'clock; the ordinary
little ones at twenty-five cents each, and special ones at fifty
cents."

had been sent him by a Scotch admirer in Peebles:

"A jeweled watch from Peebles. How strangely unexpected! It reminds me
of an open-air performance of 'As You Like It' that I once rehearsed.

"I rehearsed this amateur performance in a garden that was overlooked
by a building operation. As my amateurs postured and chanted the
bard's beautiful lines, bricklayers above us laid bricks, carpenters
planed boards, and masons chipped stones.

"And one afternoon, during a silent pause in our rehearsal, we heard a
voice from the building operation say gravely:

"'I prithee, malapert, pass me yonder brick.'"

A clergyman who was very popular with his congregation saw a lady
about to call whom he was anxious not to meet. So he said to his

"I'll run upstairs, my dear, and escape till she goes away."

After about an hour he quietly tiptoed to the stair landing and

called out over the balustrade:

"Well, my dear, you got rid of that old bore at last?"

The next instant a voice from below rooted him to the spot. It was the

"Yes, dear, she went away over an hour ago; but here is our good

Not having telegraphed for accommodations, the politician discovered

William Waldorf Astor, before he set out for his English home, said,
apropos of the Russo-Japanese War: "Nations engaged in war not only
harm each other, but they lay themselves open to harm at the hands of
all sorts of other nations. In fact, two nations at war are in the
defenseless and gullible position of a certain English married couple.

"This couple will fall out and cease to speak to one another for a

is a certain elderly matron, a great bore, who visits them
continually. Some one asked this matron which of the pair was always
inviting her. She answered, frankly, 'Neither invites me ever, but
since they don't speak to each other, each always thinks I am the

They were talking over the carelessness of well-to-do people who, by
overlooking their small bills, frequently bring disaster upon the
tradesmen who are trying to do business on a small capital.

"It sometimes happens that these poor devils have two or three times
the amount of their capital out in bills that if paid promptly would
make their commercial ways a path of roses," said the economist.
"Little bills of three, four, and five dollars, not much in
themselves, mount up high in the aggregate, and it sometimes happens
that a seeming prosperity, through the failure of a lot of customers
to pay their bills within a reasonable time, results in ruin.

"And yet," said the reminiscencer, "it sometimes works the other way.
I heard a story in England once of a harness dealer who on entering
his shop one afternoon, after an absence of several hours, noticed
that a rather handsome saddle that he had had in stock had
disappeared. He made immediate inquiry of his salesmen, and one of
them informed him that he had sold it to a gentleman who had come to
the shop with his trap, that the purchaser had thrown it into his
wagon and driven off, after telling him to charge it. Unfortunately,
however, he had forgotten to ask the gentleman's name, and all effort
to identify him by description failed.

"'Well,' said the shopkeeper, who was an ingenious man, 'there is only
one thing left to be done. We will charge the saddle up on all our
outstanding accounts. Those who did not buy the saddle will, of
course, call our attention to our error, and the man who did take it
will, of course, pay."

"This method was adopted, and at the beginning of the next month the
bills were sent out accordingly. Two weeks later the saddler
approached his cashier, and asked if he had heard as yet about the
matter. 'How about that missing saddle, Marcus?' he asked. 'We are
doing very well, sir,' replied the cashier. 'Forty of our customers
have paid for it, and only two have discovered the mistake.'"

A gentleman riding with an Irishman came within sight of an old
gallows and, to display his wit, said:

"Pat, do you see that?"

"To be sure Oi do," replied Pat.

"And where would you be to-day if the gallows had its due?"

"Oi'd be riding alone," replied Pat.

Jerry O'Rafferty came from the north of Ireland. During all his life
there and later in Chicago he had never been inside a Catholic Church.

He was something of a scoffer at religious ceremonies, although he
knew little about them. His good friend, Michael O'Brien, was troubled
at this, and always used his influence to get Jerry into the church.
At last he was successful. Jerry grudgingly consented to go to church
Easter Sunday because of the importance of the occasion.

The two sat together, Jerry an interested spectator, while Mike
entered into the services like the devout man he was.

Jerry was soon evidently impressed by the splendor of his
surroundings and the grandeur of the services. He watched the lighting
of the candles and listened attentively to the glorious burst of
Easter music. Then he could refrain from commenting no longer.

"Mike," he whispered, leaning over to his companion, "this bates
h--l."

"Whist," replied Mike, in a loud whisper, "sich is the intintion."

Bishop Wilmer of Alabama, famous as a story-teller, told of one of his
friends who had lost a dearly beloved wife and, in his sorrow, caused
these words to be inscribed on her tombstone: "The light of mine eyes
has gone out." The bereaved married within a year. Shortly afterward
the Bishop was walking through the graveyard with another gentleman.
When they arrived at the tomb, the latter asked the Bishop what he
would say of the present state of affairs, in view of the words on the
tombstone. "I think," said the Bishop, "the words 'But I have struck
another match' should be added."

A man of letters who visited Washington recently appeared at but one
dinner-party during his stay. Then he sat next to the daughter of a
noted naval officer. Her vocabulary is of a kind peculiar to very
young girls, but she rattled away at the famous man without a moment's
respite. It was during a pause in the general conversation that she
said to him: "I'm awfully stuck on Shakespeare. Don't you think he's
terribly interesting?" Everybody listened to hear the great man's
brilliant reply, for as a Shakespearian scholar he has few peers.
"Yes," he said, solemnly, "I do think he is interesting. I think he is
more than that. I think Shakespeare is just simply too cute for
anything."

A well-known Scotch professor was occasionally called up to Balmoral
to attend the late Queen Victoria, and was extremely proud of the
honor. One day a notice appeared in the university which stated that
Professor ---- could not attend his classes that day as he had been
called up to Balmoral to see the Queen. A waggish student who saw the

"The other day," said a man passenger in a street-car, "I saw a woman
in a street-car open a satchel and take out a purse, close the satchel
and open the purse, take out a dime and close the purse, open the
satchel and put in the purse. Then she gave the dime to the conductor
and took a nickel in exchange. Then she opened the satchel and took

nickel and closed the purse, opened the satchel and put in the purse,
closed the satchel and locked both ends. Then she felt to see if her
back hair was all right, and it was all right, and she was all right.
That was a woman."

As a couple of callers were in the parlor of a friend who is a firm
Christian Scientist, the voice of five-year-old Florence could be
heard from an upper room, fretting. Upon their inquiries about her
the mother replied simply she was suffering from a "belief" in a boil.

One of the visitors was a rather grim great-aunt of the family who
possesses a most lively scorn of Mrs. Eddy's so-called science as well
as a deep-rooted affection for little Florence. She immediately
demanded what had been applied for her relief and as naturally the
answer was, "Nothing." She assumed her most decided expression, drew
off her gloves and started upstairs.

"Aunt Molly, what are you going to do? I must repeat it is only a
belief in a boil," expostulated the mother.

"Very well," retorted Aunt Molly, continuing her march upstairs, "I am
merely going to put on a dream of a poultice."

And she did.

When the thermometer dropped below zero Mrs. Rogers was much disturbed
by the thought that Huldah, the new kitchen maid, slept in an unheated
room.

"Huldah," she said, remembering the good old custom of her girlhood,
"it's going to be pretty cold to-night. I think you had better take a
flatiron to bed with you."

"Yes, ma'am," assented Huldah without enthusiasm.

Mrs. Rogers, happy in the belief that her maid was comfortable, slept
soundly. In the morning she visited the kitchen.

"Well, Huldah, how did you get along with the flatiron?"

Huldah breathed a deep sigh of recollection.

"Vell, ma'am, I got it 'most warm before morning."

Many children are so crammed with everything that they really know
nothing.

In proof of this, read these veritable specimens of definitions,
written by public-school children:

"Stability is taking care of a stable."

"A mosquito is the child of black and white parents."

"Monastery is the place for monsters."

"Tocsin is something to do with getting drunk."

"Expostulation is to have the smallpox."

"Cannibal is two brothers who killed each other in the Bible."

"Anatomy is the human body, which consists of three parts, the head,
the chist, and the stummick. The head contains the eyes and brains, if
any. The chist contains the lungs and a piece of the liver. The
stummick is devoted to the bowels, of which there are five, a, e, i,
o, u, and sometimes w and y."

Little Polly, coming in from her walk one morning, informed her mother
that she had seen a lion in the park. No amount of persuasion or
reasoning could make her vary her statement one hairbreadth. That
night, when she slipped down on her knees to say her prayers, her
mother said, "Polly, ask God to forgive you for that fib."

Polly hid her face for a moment. Then she looked straight into her

him, mama, dearest, and he said, 'Don't mention it, Miss Polly; that

Two candidates for office in Missouri were stumping the northern part
of the State. In one town their appearance was almost simultaneous.
The candidate last arriving stopped at a house for a drink of water.
To the little girl who answered his knock at the door he said--when
she had given him the desired drink and he had offered her some candy
in recompense:

"Did the man ahead of me give you anything?"

"Oh, yes," replied the girl. "He gave me candy."

"Ah!" exclaimed the candidate. "Here's five cents for you. I don't
suppose that _he_ gave you any money?"

The youngster laughed. "Yes, he did, too! He gave me ten cents!"

Not to be outdone, the candidate gave the little one another nickel
and picking her up in his arms, kissed her.

"Did he kiss you, too?" he asked genially.

"Yes, he did, sir," responded the little girl, "and he kissed ma,

Senator W. A. Clark detests nothing more than to be interrupted when
busy. One day he was in his office engaged in a business conversation
when a petite woman, carrying a black bag, entered. With a compelling
smile and an insinuating manner she approached the surly millionaire.
Utterly insensible to his repellent mood and indifferent to his abrupt
manner she drew from the depths of a bag a handsomely bound volume,
the merits and beauty of which she began eloquently to descant upon.

Failing to embarrass her with arctic frigidity and impatient at her
persistency under rebuffs all but vulgar, he turned suddenly upon the
chattering woman and asked:

"Madam, do you know what my time is worth?"

She confessed it was a conundrum.

"Well," he said, petulantly, "it's worth $30 an hour!"

He turned away with the air of one who had settled the matter
definitely beyond any further controversy. But he didn't know the
woman.

"Oh, I'm so grateful to you, Mr. Clark," she replied, with a tone of
pathos in her voice. "Thirty dollars an hour, did you say?"

"Yes; that's what I said, and it's cheap at that," and he smiled
cynically.

"Oh, I know it's dirt cheap," she chirped with winsome blitheness. "I
am so glad you told me"--rummaging in her reticule, from which she
quickly flashed out a purse gorged with currency. Moving near to the
astonished millionaire, who now regarded her movements with unfeigned
curiosity, she counted two bills, a ten and a five, off the roll.
These she pushed along the top of the sloping desk toward him and
said: "Yes, I'm glad you told me, because I hadn't expected to get it
so cheap. There is $15. Now, I want a half hour of your uninterrupted
attention while I talk to you about this book."

Clark pushed the money back and subscribed and paid for two copies of
the book.

A dear old New England spinster, the embodiment of the timid and
shrinking, passed away at Carlsbad, where she had gone for her health.
Her nearest kinsman, a nephew, ordered her body sent back to be
buried--as was her last wish--in the quiet little country churchyard.
His surprise can be imagined, when on opening the casket, he beheld,
instead of the placid features of his aunt Mary, the majestic port of
an English General in full regimentals, whom he remembered had chanced
to die at the same time and place as his aunt.

At once he cabled to the General's heirs explaining the situation and

A clergyman was on board a steamer which was caught in a severe gale.
The rolling was constant and seemed to get worse as time went on. At
last the good man got thoroughly frightened. He believed they were
destined for a watery grave, so he went to the captain and asked if he
might have prayers. The captain took him by the arm and led him to the
forecastle, where the tars were singing and swearing. "There," said
he, "when you hear the men swearing you may know there is no danger."
The clergyman went back feeling better, but still the storm increased
and his alarm also. Disconsolate, he managed to stagger to the
forecastle again, where he heard the sailors swearing as hard as ever.
"Mary," he said to his sympathetic wife as he crawled back to his
berth, "Mary, thank God, they're swearing yet."

"Hawaiian servants," said a woman with some experience of them, "are
the best in the world, but they are strangely unsophisticated,
strangely naive. They insist on calling you by your first name. Ours
were always saying to my husband, 'Yes, John,' or 'all right, John,'
and to me 'very well, Ann,' or 'Ann, I am going out.' At last I got
tired of this and to John, when we got a new cook, I said: Don't ever
call me by my first name in the cook's presence. Then, perhaps, not
knowing my name, he'll have to say 'Mrs.' to me. So John was careful
to address me as 'dearie,' or 'sweetheart,' the watchful chap gave me
no title at all. One day we had some English officers to dine. I told
them how I had overcome, in my new cook's case, the native servants'
abuse of their employer's Christian names, and I said, By this
servant, at least, you won't hear me called 'Ann.'" Just then the new
cook entered the room. He bowed to me respectfully and said:

"'Sweetheart, dinner is served!'

"'What?' I stammered.

"'Dinner is served, dearie!' answered the cook."

Mike and Pat worked for a wealthy farmer. They planned to turn
burglars and steal the money which the farmer had hid in one of the
rooms of his house. They waited until midnight, then started to do the
job.

In order to get the money they had to pass the farmer's bedroom. Mike

Mike started to pass the room. Just as he got opposite the door the

"I asked her to sew a button on this vest last night, and she hasn't
touched it," he said. At this the older man assumed the air of a
patriarch.

"Never ask a woman to mend anything," he said. "You haven't been
married very long, and I think I can give you some serviceable
suggestions. When I want a shirt mended I take it to my wife, flourish
it around a little and say, 'Where's that rag-bag?'

"'What do you want of the rag-bag?' asks my wife. Her suspicions are
roused at once.

"'I want to throw this shirt away; it's worn out,' I say, with a few
more flourishes.

"'Let me see that shirt,' my wife says then. 'Now, John, hand it to me
at once.'

"Of course, I pass it over, and she examines it. 'Why, John Taylor,'
she is sure to say, 'I never knew such extravagance! This is a
perfectly good shirt. All it needs is----' And then she mends it."

A browbeating counsel asked a witness how far he had been from a
certain place. "Just four yards, two feet, and six inches," was the
reply. "How come you to be so exact, my friend?" "I expected some fool

"Now, see here, porter," said the drummer briskly, "I want you to put
me off at Syracuse. You know we get in there about six o'clock in the
morning, and I may over-sleep myself. But it is important that I
should get out. Here's a five-dollar gold piece. Now, I may wake up
hard. Don't mind if I kick. Pay no attention if I'm ugly. I want you
to put me off the train no matter how hard I fight. Understand?"

"Yes, sah," answered the sturdy Nubian. "It shall be did, sah!"

The next morning the coin-giver was awakened by a stentorian voice
calling: "Rochester!"

"Rochester!" he exclaimed, sitting up. "Where's that porter?"

Hastily slipping on his trousers, he went in search of the negro, and
found him in the porter's closet, huddled up, with his head in a
bandage, his clothes torn, and his arm in a sling.

"Well," said the drummer, "you are a sight. Why didn't you put me off
at Syracuse?"

"Wha-at!" gasped the porter, jumping up, as his eyes bulged from his
head. "Was you de gemman dat give me a five-dollah gold piece?"

"Of course I was, you idiot!"

"Well, den, befoah de Lawd, who was dat gemman I put off at Syracuse?"

A right reverend prelate, himself a man of extreme good-nature, was
frequently much vexed in spirit by the proud, froward, perverse, and
untractable temper of his next vicar. The latter, after an absence
much longer than usual, one day paid a visit to the bishop, who kindly
inquired the cause of his absence, and was answered by the vicar that
he had been confined to his house for some time past by an obstinate
stiffness in his knee. "I am glad of that," replied the prelate; "'tis
a good symptom that the disorder has changed place, for I had a long
time thought it immovably settled in your neck."

Francis Wilson was speaking at the Players Club of New York City, not
long ago, of the all too prevalent ignorance of dramatic literature in
the country to-day.

"Why," said Mr. Wilson, "a company was playing 'She Stoops to
Conquer' in a small Western town last winter when a man without any
money, wishing to see the show, stepped up to the box office and said:

"'Pass me in, please.'

"The box office man gave a loud, harsh laugh.

"'Pass you in? What for?' he asked.

"The applicant drew himself up and answered, haughtily: 'What for?
Why, because I am Oliver Goldsmith, author of the play.'

"'Oh, I beg your pardon, sir,' replied the other in a meek voice, as
he hurriedly wrote an order for a box."

After a few weeks at boarding-school Alice wrote home as follows:

"_Dear Father_--Though I was homesick at first, now that I am getting
acquainted, I like the school very much. Last evening Grayce and
Kathryn (my roommates) and I had a nice little chafing-dish party,
and we invited three other girls, Mayme and Carrye Miller and Edyth
Kent. I hope you are all well at home. I can't write any more now for
I have a lot of studying to do. With lots of love to all.

    "Your affectionate daughter,

    "ALYSS."

To this she received the following reply:

"_My dear Daughter Alyss_--I was glad to receive your letter and to
know that you are enjoying yourself. Uncle Jaymes came the other day,
bringing Charls and Albyrt with him. Your brother Henrie was
delighted, for he has been lonely without you. I have bought a new

While Chauncey M. Depew was at the Omaha Exposition, he and President
Callaway of the New York Central chanced to go into a booth on the
Midway Plaisance.

It was a tame entertainment and there was only a meager attendance
when Mr. Depew and Mr. Callaway entered. Their stay would have been
very brief except for the fact that they had scarcely taken their
seats before there began a steady inpouring of people, which continued
until the small auditorium was crowded.

Taking this extraordinary increase of spectators as an indication that
something of an interesting nature was about to be disclosed, the two
New Yorkers concluded to sit it out. Half an hour's waiting failed to
reward their patient expectancy, however, and Mr. Callaway suggested
that they move on.

Just then ex-Secretary of Agriculture J. Sterling Morton pushed his
way through the crowd, and, extending his hand to Mr. Depew,
exclaimed:

"Well, Doctor Depew, so you are really here! I thought that 'barker'
was lying."

"What do you mean?" inquired Mr. Depew.

"Why, the 'barker' for this show is standing outside and inviting the
crowd to 'step up lively' and pay ten cents for the privilege of
seeing the 'great and only Chauncey M. Depew.'"

That the royal road to learning is full of strange pitfalls is
shown by some of the definitions and statements given by
school-children--some of whom are well along the way. The following
are _bona fide_ samples coming under the knowledge of one teacher:

"About this time Columbus was cursing around among the West Indies."

"Jackson's campaign in the Valley was the greatest piece of
millinery-work ever known."

"The Valkyrie were the Choosers of the Slain, and the Valhalla the
Haulers of the Slain."

"The eldest son of the King of France is called The Dolphin."

"The Duke of Clarence, according to his usual custom, was killed in
battle."

A certain curate in the course of conversation at a dinner party some
time ago remarked to a friend, "I had a curious dream last night, but
as it was about my vicar I hardly like to tell it." On being pressed,
however, he began: "I dreamt I was dead and was on my way to Heaven,
which was reached by a very long ladder. At the foot I was met by an
angel, who pressed a piece of chalk into my hand and said, 'If you
climb long enough you will reach Heaven, but for every sin you are
conscious of having committed you must mark a rung of the ladder with
the chalk as you go up.' I took the chalk and started. I had climbed
up very, very far and was feeling very tired when I suddenly met my
vicar coming down. 'Hullo!' I said, 'what are you going down for?'
'More chalk.'"

A certain curate was of a painfully nervous temperament, and in
consequence was constantly making awkward remarks--intended as
compliments--to the bishop and others. Having distinguished himself in
an unusual degree during a gathering of clergy to an afternoon tea at
the bishop's palace, he was taken to task for his failings by a senior
curate, who was one of his companions on the way home.

"Look here, Bruce," said the senior decidedly, "you are a donkey! Why
can not you keep quiet, instead of making your asinine remarks? I am
speaking to you now as a brother----"

Loud laughter interrupted him at this point, and for the moment he

work agreeably; and on being invited to another living, he accepted

farewell sermon; and we can imagine the feelings of the curate who was
to be left behind when he heard the text given out, "Abide ye here
with the ass, and I and the lad will go yonder and worship."

patients should undress before entering his consulting room so as not

A story is told of a certain committee meeting in which the
proceedings commenced with noise and gradually became uproarious. At
last one of the disputants, losing all control over his emotions,
exclaimed to his opponent: "Sir, you are, I think, the biggest ass
that I ever had the misfortune to set eyes upon!" "Order! order!" said
the chairman, gravely; "you seem to forget that I am in the room."

An Irish priest had labored hard with one of his flock to induce him
to give up whisky. "I tell you, Michael," said the priest, "whisky is
your worst enemy, and you should keep as far away from it as you can."
"The enemy is it, father?" responded Michael, "and it was your
riverence's self that was telling us in the pulpit last Sunday to love
our enemies." "So I was, Michael," rejoined the priest, "but I didn't
tell you to swallow them."

A Sabbath-school worker was visiting a Sabbath-school some distance
from home. Being called upon to address the school, he commenced by
asking, "Who can tell me something about Peter?" (the lesson was about
Peter that day). Having received no answer from either large or small
pupils, he again made the request. This time a little girl put up her
hand. He called the little girl to him and placed her upon a chair.
After complimenting her on her bravery and brightness, he asked her to
tell him all she knew about Peter. In return came the following:

    "Peter, Peter, pumpkin-eater,
    Had a wife and couldn't keep her;
    Put her in a pumpkin shell
    Where he kept her very well."

Senator Beveridge, in recommending broad and generous views to the
graduating class of a medical school, told this story:

"I once saw two famous physicians introduced at a reception. They were
deservedly famous, but they were of opposing schools; and the regular,
as he shook the other by the hand, said loudly:

"'I am glad to meet you as a gentleman, sir, though I can't admit that
you are a physician.'

"'And I,' said the homeopathist, smiling faintly, 'am glad to meet you
as a physician, though I can't admit you are a gentleman.'"

At a recent dinner in London the conversation turned to the subject of
lynching in the United States. It was the general opinion that a large
percentage of Americans met death at the end of a rope. Finally the
hostess turned to an American, who had taken no part in the
conversation, and said:

"You, sir, must have often seen these affairs."

"Yes," he replied, "we take a kind of municipal pride in seeing which
city can show the greatest number of lynchings yearly."

"Oh, do tell us about a lynching you have seen yourself," broke in
half a dozen voices at once.

"The night before I sailed for England," said Eugene Field, "I was

adjoining table. The gown was utterly ruined, and the gentlemen of her
party at once seized the waiter, tied a rope around his neck, and at a
signal from the injured lady swung him into the air."

"Horrible," said the hostess with a shudder. "And did you actually see
this yourself?"

"Well, no," admitted the American apologetically. "Just at that moment
I happened to be downstairs killing the chef for putting mustard in
the blanc mange."

Mrs. Jones recently spent a few days at a farm, and in a moment of
originality bought some poultry from the farmer with a view to their
providing fresh eggs for breakfast every morning. She sent them to
town per the local carrier, despatching a note at the same time to her
husband telling him to look out for the consignment. When Jones
reached home from his office he inquired if the poultry had arrived.
The servant told him they had, but the man had carelessly put them in
the back yard, leaving the door open, and they had all escaped.
Thereupon a fowl hunt was immediately organized. The next day Jones
saw the carrier. "Nice trick you played me yesterday," said he; "spent
three hours hunting those fowls and only found ten." "Then think
yourself blessed lucky," replied the man. "I only brought six."

The new minister in a Georgia church was delivering his first sermon.
The darky janitor was a critical listener from a back corner of the
church. The minister's sermon was eloquent, and his prayers seemed to
cover the whole category of human wants.

After the services one of the deacons asked the old darky what he
thought of the new minister. "Don't you think he offers up a good
prayer, Joe?"

"Ah mos' suhtainly does, boss. Why, dat man axed de good Lord fo'

For weeks the kindergarten had been deluged with nature verses, and
the process of absorption was far advanced. Sufficiently to admit of
a little squeezing with results, thought the teacher.

"Now, children," she said, "I want you each to bring in a little verse
that you have made yourselves about the buds, or the trees, or the
flowers, or anything that pleases you."

Various specimens were produced next day, but the gem of the
collection was little May Flynn's. With appropriate gestures she
recited:

    "See the pretty gold fish swimming in the globe!
    See the pretty robin singing in the tree!

      Who stucked the fur upon their breasts?

which caused the postponement of the coronation, he was racing down
one of the country roads in his motor-car at a speed which was away

"Hi! Hi!" called a policeman. "Stop there, in the name of the law!"

Herbert S. Stone, the publisher, described at a dinner in Washington
the amusing methods of a newspaper writer who used to write articles
at a set rate a column.

He was once commissioned to do a serial story for a Chicago paper. The
story, as it proceeded from week to week, was interesting, but it
contained many passages like the following:

"Did you hear him?"

"I did."

"Truly?"

"Truly."

"Where?"

"By the well."

"When?"

"To-day."

"Then he lives?"

"He does."

"Ah."

The editor, sending for the man, said:

"Hereafter we will pay you by the letters in your serial. We will pay
you so much a thousand letters."

The young man, looking crestfallen, went away, but in the very next
instalment of his story he introduced a character who stuttered, and
all through the chapter were scattered passages like this:

"B-b-b-b-believe me, s-s-s-sir, I am n-n-not g-g-g-guilty. M-m-m-my
m-m-m-mother c-c-c-committed this c-c-c-crime."

yourself."

about ten minutes gazing at the good things and repeating over and
over again, "speak reverently," she exclaimed, "For God's sake pass me

Hiram Hardscrabble and his load of hay, two horses, and a perfectly
good wagon were pitched so high and so far by a reckless railroad
train that when they came down they weren't--any of 'em--good for
much. The local Congressman took the case, and after some months
advised Hiram to accept the railroad company's offer of lifelong
employment at $15 a week. Hiram accepted. They put him out as a
flagman on a crossing near his native village.

Cassidy, the section boss, stopped his handcar before the flag-shanty,
and after a searching look at Hiram advised as follows:

"So you're the new flagman, are ye? And ye've niver railroaded before.
No harm. We'll make a man iv ye. See, now, there's yer red flag and
yer green flag and yer white flag, and yer thrain schedule within on
the wall. All ye have to do is dhrop the gates befoor the thrains do
come, so that they'll have a clear thrack. D'ye mind, now?

"But there's wan thing above all others--th' Impire Shtate Express!
Putt yer gates down two minyits before she comes and keep them down
till she's pasht. Mind now, she must niver be late on this section.
Niver wan minyit late. I won't sthand f'r it. Remimber--th' Impire
Shtate Express. She must niver be late here."

Hiram promised. At 2 P.M., when the Empire State Express was due in
two minutes, he dropped the crossing gates and stood by with the white
flag to wave her along. Three minutes passed, four, five--and still no
train. As a matter of fact, she had lost half an hour at an open draw
on the Harlem River in the morning, and was laboring mightily to
regain lost time in spite of her fast schedule.

Seven minutes late, and then Hiram heard a wild shriek a mile away and
saw the express coming. He darted into the shanty, grabbed a red flag,
and leaped out upon the track, waving it furiously. The engineer shut
off, threw over the reverse lever, gave her sand and the air; and the
mighty train stopped short, in a whirl of sand, cinders, and sparks,
brakes creaking and passengers pitchpoling everywhere.

"What's the matter now?" roared the engineer, thrusting half his body
out of the cab and glaring down at Hiram.

"Be yeou th' ingineer?" asked the flagman, peering at him with
suspicion.

"Yes, yes! Whad-do-you want?"

"I want t' know whut's made ye so goldinged late? Cassidy says he
wun't stand f'r it."

Mark Twain observed once at a public dinner that he had written a
friendly letter to Queen Victoria protesting against a tax being
levied in England on his head, on the ground that it was a gas-works.
"I don't know you," he wrote, "but I've met your son. He was at the
head of a procession in the Strand, and I was on a 'bus." Years
afterward he met the King at Homburg, and they had a long talk. At
parting the King said: "I am glad to have met you again." That last
word troubled Mark, who asked whether the King had not mistaken him
for some one else. The reply--"Why, don't you remember meeting me in
the Strand when I was at the head of a procession and you were on a
'bus?" revealed the strength of Royal memories.

and perused a letter which seemed to be addressed to him. It was a
request from a tailor for the settlement of his little bill. As the

it, walk into the reading-room, read it carefully, and tear it into

A young woman in Central Park overheard an old negress call to a

"Excuse me, but that's a queer name for a baby, aunty?"

Her ma picked it out in a medicine book--yessum, de child's full name

Sir Richard Bethell, afterward Lord Westbury, with a suave voice and a
stately manner, nevertheless had a way of bearing down the foe with
almost savage wit. Once, in court, he had to follow a barrister who
had delivered his remarks in very loud tones. "Now that the noise in
court has subsided," murmured Bethell, "I will tell your Honor in two
sentences the gist of the case."

The resemblance of the Rev. Robert Collyer to Henry Ward Beecher was
often remarked. One day, when walking through Central Park, hat in
hand, as the day was hot, at a sharp turn in the path he came upon an
old lady seated on one of the park benches. At sight of him she jumped
to her feet, exclaiming:

"Goodness me! This is not Mr. Beecher?"

"No, madam," Dr. Collyer answered, "it is not. I hope Mr. Beecher is
in a cooler place."

It is not necessary that a lawyer should be eloquent to win verdicts,
but he must have the tact which turns an apparent defeat to his own
advantage. One of the most successful of verdict winners was Sir James
Scarlett. His skill in turning a failure into a success was wonderful.
In a breach-of-promise case the defendant, Scarlett's client, was
alleged to have been cajoled into an engagement by the plaintiff's
mother. She was a witness in behalf of her daughter, and completely
baffled Scarlett, who cross-examined her. But in his argument he
exhibited his tact by this happy stroke of advocacy: "You saw,
gentlemen of the jury, that I was but a child in her hands. What must
my client have been?"

He was a young man--a candidate for an agricultural constituency--and
he was sketching in glowing colors to an audience of rural voters the
happy life the laborer would lead under an administration for the
propagation of sweetness and light. "We have not yet three acres and a
cow, but it will come. Old-age pensions are still of the future, but
they will come." Similarly every item of his comprehensive program was
endorsed by the same parrot cry. Then he went on to talk of prison
reforms. "I have not yet personally," he said, "been inside a criminal
lunatic asylum." Then there was a voice from the back of the hall,
"But it will come."

The judge had had his patience sorely tried by lawyers who wished to
talk and by men who wished to evade jury service.

"Shudge!" cried a little German in the jury box.

"What is it?" demanded the judge.

"I t'ink I like to go home to my wife," said the German.

"You can't," retorted the judge. "Sit down."

"But, shudge," persisted the German, "I don't t'ink I make a good

"You're the best in the box," said the judge. "Sit down."

"Jury box," said the judge.

"But, shudge," persisted the little German, "I don't speak good
English."

"You don't have to speak any at all," said the judge. "Sit down."

The little German pointed at the lawyers to make his last desperate
plea.

"Shudge," he said, "I don't make noddings of what these fellers say."

It was the judge's chance to get even for many annoyances.

"Neither can any one else," he said. "Sit down."

A parson, diminutive in size and his head covered with hair of the

From a French journal comes this little anecdote of a tutor and his
royal pupil.

The lesson was in Roman history, and the prince was unprepared.

"We come now to the Emperor Caligula. What do you know about him,

The question was followed by a silence that was becoming awkward when
it was broken by the diplomatic tutor. "Your highness is right," he

An error for which nervousness may have been responsible was that made
by the boy who was told to take the Bishop's shaving water to him one

managed to transpose the words of this sentence with ludicrous effect,

In one of the Atlanta Sunday-schools recently the lesson for the day
had to do with Mammon and the corrupting influences of great riches.

Toward the close of the exercises the superintendent called upon the
infant class to repeat the Golden Text, which had special reference to
man's inability to serve his Creator and the money-god at one and the
same time. The class failed to respond as it should, when the
superintendent, noticing his own young hopeful in the ranks, who had
that very morning been drilled thoroughly on the text, called on him.
The response was immediate, though a slight departure from the
original, for in a voice that was distinctly heard in all parts of the
room there came the following modification:

"Ye can not serve God and mama!"

Once upon a time there was a young married man who had some slight
bickerings with the woman of his choice. These having occurred with
great frequency, he went to his father, who was older and much more
married.

"Father," he said, "is it not meet that I should be the ringmaster in
my own wickiup? Or must I kowtow to the old lady?"

Whereat the old man smiled wisely and said:

"My son, yonder are a hundred chickens and here a fine team of horses.
Do you place the feathered tribe on this wagon, hitch up the team, and
start out. Wherever you find a man and his wife living together, make
diligent investigation to find out who the commanding officer is, and
where it is the woman give her a chicken. If you find a man running a
house give him one of the horses."

So the young man loaded up the fowls and started out upon his
pilgrimage of self-education. And when he had but seven chickens
left, he approached a habitation with his forlorn inquiry, to which
the man replied:

"I'm the ace-high cockalorum of this outfit."

And the wife, without fear or favor, corroborated the statement. Then
the young man said:

"Take your choice of the horses. Either one you fancy is yours." And
after the man had walked around the team several times and looked in
their mouths, he said, "Well, I'll take the bay."

Now, the wife didn't like bay horses, and she called John aside, and
after whispering in his ear she allowed him to return.

"I guess I'll take the black horse," he said.

"Not a bit of it," said the pilgrim. "You'll take a chicken."

Levinsky, despairing of his life, made an appointment with a famous
specialist. He was surprised to find fifteen or twenty people in the
waiting-room.

After a few minutes he leaned over to a gentleman near him and
whispered, "Say, mine frient, this must be a pretty goot doctor, ain't
he?"

"One of the best," the gentleman told him.

Levinsky seemed to be worrying over something.

"Vell, say," he whispered again, "he must be pretty exbensive, then,

The stranger was annoyed by Levinsky's questions and answered rather
shortly: "Fifty dollars for the first consultation and twenty-five
dollars for each visit thereafter."

"Mine Gott!" gasped Levinsky. "Fifty tollars the first time und
twenty-five tollars each time afterwards!"

For several minutes he seemed undecided whether to go or to wait. "Und
twenty-five tollars each time afterward," he kept muttering. Finally,
just as he was called into the office, he was seized with a brilliant

He was a big, black, good-hearted, old negro, stranded near Boston,
and he had decided, after considerable "cogitation," to work his way
back to, the South, where he would feel more at home. In Boston, in
Springfield, in Hartford, in New Haven, it was always the same. When
he rang a bell and asked for work and a bite to eat the answer
usually was, "I'm very sorry, but there's not a thing to be done here
to-day." There were occasional exceptions, of course, or uncle could
never have got on, but the thing most to be counted upon was pleasing
politeness coupled with nothing else.

At last the old man left New York and then Philadelphia behind, and
one day found himself in Baltimore. His knowledge of geography was
_nil_, but he thought he ought soon to be getting into "de Souf," and
with that hope at heart rang the bell of a fine house on Charles
Street. The door was opened by the host himself, who, after an
instant's survey of the figure before him, blurted out:

"Why, yo' ---- black rascal! How dare yo' ring this bell? Get off mah
steps this secon', befo' I brek yo' haid!"

for all yo' want? Get yo'self round back, an' they'll feed yo'
full--but cyart yo' good-for-nuthin' black carcass off these steps, I
say."

And as uncle went around to the side door he raised his hands to
heaven, and with tears of rejoicing running down his furrowed cheeks,
said:

"Bress de Lord! I's back agin among mah own folks!"

Former President Scott, of the Cincinnati Southern Railroad, was
greatly annoyed, when he first took hold of the road, by the claims
for horses and cattle killed by trains on their way through Kentucky.
It seemed as though it were not possible for a train to run north or
south through Kentucky without killing either a horse or a cow. And
every animal killed, however scrawny, scrubby, or miserable it may
have been before the accident, always figured in the claims
subsequently presented as of the best blood in Kentucky. "Well," said

One day a very clerical looking man, with immaculate white cravat and
choker, approached the entrance.

"You can't come in here," said the janitor.

"The ---- I can't!" said the stranger.

"Oh," said the janitor, "excuse me. Step right in."

It is said that the visitor was the late State Senator Sessions, of
Western New York.

The following anecdote of ex-President Roosevelt's youth is told:

When Roosevelt was a student at Harvard he was required to recite a
poem in public declamation. He got as far as a line which read:

"When Greece her knees in suppliance bent," when he stuck there.

Again he tried:

"When Greece her knees...," but could get no farther.

The teacher waited patiently, finally remarking:

"Grease her knees again, Roosevelt, then perhaps she'll go."

A Young graduate in law, who had had some experience in New York City,
wrote to a prominent practitioner in Arkansas to inquire what chance
there was in that section for such a one as he described himself to
be. He said: "I am a Republican in politics, and an honest young
lawyer." The reply that came seemed encouraging in its interest: "If
you are a Republican the game laws here will protect you, and if you
are an honest lawyer you will have no competition."

As the immaculate young woman and the tired but happy-looking young
man entered the Pullman, followed by a grinning porter, the other
passengers became "wise" in a moment. The stout drummer leaned over to
the man behind him and remarked:

"Bride and groom--100 to 1."

Every one turned to view the newcomers, who had deposited themselves
vis-a-vis in No. 4. As if unconscious of any scrutiny, the young man
said, in a high, nasal voice:

"Well, do as you like about it; either increase the margin or let it
go. You didn't follow my advice in the first place, but if you want to
pull out, you'd better do it now."

"Oh, I know," the woman replied. "What's the use of going all over it
again?"

"Huh!" said the stout man's companion. "Guess you lose. Been playing
the market. Not much bride and groom talk in that."

The rest of the passengers sniffed and then turned their backs on the
new couple. Whereat the young man smiled at the young woman, and they
softly joined hands as he whispered:

"Millicent, dear, my shoes are full of rice."

A Short time ago an old lady went on board Nelson's flag-ship, the
_Victory_. The different objects of interest were duly shown her, and
on reaching the spot where the great naval hero was wounded (which is

fell." "And no wonder!" exclaimed the old lady; "I nearly fell there
myself."

A Good Samaritan, passing an apartment-house in the small hours of the
morning, noticed a man leaning limply against the doorway.

"What's the matter?" he asked. "Drunk?"

"Yep."

"Do you live in this house?"

"Yep."

"Do you want me to help you upstairs?"

"Yep."

With much difficulty he half dragged, half carried the drooping figure
up the stairway to the second floor.

"What floor do you live on?" he asked. "Is this it?"

"Yep."

Rather than face an irate wife who might, perhaps, take him for a
companion more at fault than her spouse, he opened the first door he
came to and pushed the limp figure in.

The good Samaritan groped his way downstairs again. As he was passing
through the vestibule he was able to make out the dim outlines of
another man, apparently in worse condition than the first one.

"What's the matter?" he asked. "Are you drunk, too?"

"Yep," was the feeble reply.

"Do you live in this house, too?"

"Yep."

"Shall I help you upstairs?"

"Yep."

Stopping on the second floor, where this man also said he lived, he
opened the door and pushed him in. As he again reached the front door
he discerned the shadow of a third man, evidently worse off than
either of the other two. He was about to approach him when the object
of his solicitude lurched out into the street and threw himself into
the arms of a passing policeman. "For Heaven's sake, off'cer," he
gasped, "protect me from that man. He's done nothin' all night long
but carry me upstairs 'n' throw me down th' elevator shaf'."

four miles in answer to a telephone call. On his arrival the man who
had summoned him said:

"Doctor, I ain't in any particular pain, but somehow or other I've got
a feeling that death is nigh."

The doctor felt the man's pulse and listened to his heart.

"Have you made your will?"

The man turned pale.

"Why, no, doctor, at my age--oh, Doc, it ain't true is it? It can't be
true!"

"Who's your lawyer?"

"Higginbotham."

"Well, you'd better send for him at once."

The patient, white and trembling, went to the 'phone.

"Who's your pastor?" continued the doctor.

"The Rev. Kellogg M. Brown," mumbled the patient. "But, doctor, do you
think--"

"Send for him immediately. Your father, too, should be summoned; also
your--"

"Say, doctor, do you really think I'm going to die?" The man began to
blubber softly.

The doctor looked at him hard.

"No, I don't," he replied grimly. "There's nothing at all the matter
with you. But I'd hate to be the only man you've made a fool of on a
night like this."

A certain prosy preacher recently gave an endless discourse on the
prophets. First he dwelt at length on the minor prophets. At last he
finished them, and the congregation gave a sigh of relief. He took a

prophets."

After the major prophets had received more than ample attention the
congregation gave another sigh of relief.

"Now that I have finished with the minor prophets and the major
prophets, what about Jeremiah? Where is Jeremiah's place?"

At this point a tall man arose in the back of the church. "Jeremiah

A little man, wedged into the middle of a car, suddenly thought of

in his overcoat. He plunged his hand into his pocket and was somewhat

"Aha" snorted the latter. "I caught you that time!"

"Leggo!" snarled the little man. "Leggo my hand!"

"Pickpocket!" hissed the fat man.

"Scoundrel!" retorted the little one.

Just then a tall man in their vicinity glanced up from his paper.

"I'd like to get off here," he drawled, "if you fellows don't mind

each accident the barber said, as he sponged away the blood: "Oh, dear

wrong in the air. Books were dropped, chairs were pushed along the
floor. There were various interruptions. The nerves of all were on

leave. "Wait a minute," objected Professor Kirchwey; "don't go just

A few years ago a dear old lady, who formerly lived in Ipswich, and

most good, and immediately felt comforted and enjoyed a refreshing
sleep until morning.

Upon removing the plaster, what was her astonishment to find that it
was a $10 bank note that had brought such speedy relief.

Beerbohm Tree was once endeavoring to get a well-known actor back into
his company. He invited the man to call and received him in his
dressing room as he was making-up. "How much would you want to come
back to me?" inquired Mr. Tree, busy with his paint pots. The other
named an exorbitant salary to which Tree merely retorted as he went on
making up: "Don't slam the door when you go out, will you?"

his wife?"

"No, but he's down in the library learning to play chess with papa."

"Why, pa," piped up little Tommy, "don't you remember that ma told

A minister of a fashionable church had always left the greeting of
strangers to be attended to by the ushers until he read some newspaper
articles in reference to the matter.

"Suppose a representative should visit our church," said his wife.
"Wouldn't it be awful?"

"It would," the minister admitted.

The following Sunday evening he noticed a plainly dressed woman in one
of the free pews. She sat alone and was clearly not a member of the
flock. After the benediction the minister hastened and intercepted her
at the door.

"How do you do?" he said, offering his hand. "I am very glad to have
you with us."

"Thank you," replied the young woman.

"I hope we may see you often in our church home," he went on. "We are
always glad to welcome new faces."

"Yes, sir."

"Do you live in this parish?" he asked.

The girl looked blank.

"If you will give me your address my wife and I will call on you some
evening."

"You wouldn't need to go far, sir," said the young woman. "I'm your
cook."

The mission-workers on the East Side frequently see the humorous as
well as the sadder side of life. A man prominent in reform work in
New York City recounts the experience of a certain young woman, new to
the task, who set about posting herself as to conditions in a
neighborhood near Avenue A.

The ambitious missionary had entered the house of an Irishwoman, and
had made some preliminary inquiries, when she was suddenly interrupted
by the woman, who said:

"Say, youse is fresh at dis business, ain't youse?"

The amateur in mission work blushingly admitted such to be the case,
adding, "I have never visited you before, Mrs. Muldoon."

"Thin," explained the Irishwoman, "I tell ye what to do. Ye sit down
in that chair there, ye read me a short psalm, ye gives me fifty
cints, an' thin ye goes."

Long after the victories of Washington over the French and English had
made his name familiar to all Europe, Benjamin Franklin chanced to
dine with the English and French Ambassadors, when the following
toasts were drunk:

"'England'--The Sun, whose bright beams enlighten and fructify the
remotest corners of the earth."

The French Ambassador, filled with national pride, but too polite to
dispute the previous toast, offered the following:

"'France'--The Moon, whose mild, steady and cheering rays are the
delight of all nations, consoling them in darkness and making their
dreariness beautiful."

Doctor Franklin then arose, and, with his usual dignified simplicity,
said:

"'George Washington'--The Joshua who commanded the Sun and Moon to
stand still, and they obeyed him."

The following appeal of a Western editor is still going the rounds,
although it is to be hoped that by this time the writer's only trouble
is in having his vest made large enough:

"We see by an esteemed contemporary that a young lady in Chicago is so
particular that she kneads bread with her gloves on. What of that? The
editor of this paper needs bread with his coat on; he needs bread with
his trousers on; in fact he needs bread with all of his clothes on.
And if some of his debtors don't pay up pretty quick he'll need bread
without anything at all on, and this Western climate is no Garden of
Eden."

The unconscious humors of country journalism, says William Allen
White, are often more amusing than the best efforts of the alleged
"funny man."

According to Mr. White there once appeared in a Kansas paper the

"Our prominent townsman Theodore Monkton is seriously ill. He is being
attended twice a day by Doctor Smith, in consultation with Doctor
Morgan. His recovery, therefore, is in great doubt."

A crowd of small boys were gathered about the entrance of a circus
tent in one of the small cities in New Hampshire one day, trying to
get a glimpse of the interior. A man standing near watched them for a
few moments, then walking up to the ticket-taker he said:

"Let all these boys in, and count them as they pass."

The man did as requested, and when the last one had gone, he turned
and said, "Twenty-eight."

"Good!" said the man, "I guessed just right," and walked off.

The editor of a rural newspaper determined to adopt the idea of
posting bulletins on a bulletin board for all important events that
happened in the town. Soon afterward he was told one morning by the
local physician that Deacon Jones was seriously ill. The deacon was a
man of some distinction in the community, so the editor posted a
series of bulletins as follows:

10 A. M.--Deacon Jones no better.

11 A. M.--Deacon Jones has relapse.

12.30 P. M.--Deacon Jones weaker. Pulse failing.

1 P. M.--Deacon Jones has slight rally.

2.15 P. M.--Deacon Jones's family has been summoned.

3.10 P. M.--Deacon Jones has died and gone to heaven.

Later in the afternoon a traveling salesman happened by, stopped to
read the bulletins, and going to the bulletin board, made another
report concerning the deceased. It was:

4.10 P. M.--Great excitement in heaven. Deacon Jones has not yet
arrived.

A group of drummers were trading yarns on the subject of hospitality,
when one, a little Virginian with humorous eyes and a delightful
drawl, took up his parable thus:

"I was down in Louisiana last month, travelin' 'cross country with a
friend, when we kinder got lost in a mighty lonesome sort of road just
about dark. We rode along a right good piece after sundown, and when
we saw a light ahead, I tell you it looked first-rate. We drove up to
the light, finding 'twas a house, and when I hollered like a lost calf
the man came out and we asked him to take us in for the night. He
looked at us mighty hard, then said:

"'Wal, I reckon I kin stand it if you kin.'

"So we went in and found 'twas only a two-room shanty, just swarmin'
with children. He had six, from four to eleven years old; as there
didn't seem to be but one bed, me an' Stony wondered what in thunder
would become of us.

"They gave us supper, good hog and hominy, the best they had, and then
the old woman put the two youngest kids to bed. They went straight to
sleep. Then she took those out, laid them over in the corner, put the
next two to bed, and so on.

"After all the children were asleep on the floor the old folk went in
the other room and told us we could go to bed if we wanted to, and
bein' powerful tired out, we did.

"Well, sir, the next morning when we woke up we were lying over in the
corner with the kids, and the old man and the old woman had the bed."

As every one knows, the great Von Moltke never wasted words and
despised anything that approached garrulity in others. German army
officers are fond of telling an anecdote illustrative of this
peculiarity:

Von Moltke was leaving Berlin on a railway journey. Just before the
train pulled out of the station a captain of hussars entered the
general's compartment and, recognizing him, saluted with "Guten
Morgen, Excellenz!"

Two hours later the train slowed up at a way station. The captain
arose, saluted, and with another "Guten Morgen, Excellenz!" left the
train.

Turning to one of his companions, Von Moltke said, with an expression
of the greatest disgust, "Intolerable gas-bag!"

A gentleman gave a large dinner party in Dublin once and invited Mr.
O'Connor, one of the wittiest men in the Emerald Isle, to amuse and
divert his guests. Mr. O'Connor accepted the invitation with pleasure.
But from the beginning to the end of dinner he preserved a solemn and
serious face. The host thought this very strange, and just before
rising from the table remarked to him jestingly, "Why, O'Connor, old
fellow, I don't believe the biggest fool in Ireland could make you
laugh to-night." Whereupon his guest answered in a solemn tone,
speaking his first word that evening, "Try."

Governor Guild of Massachusetts, who served in the Spanish War, tells
a story of a New York regiment, many of whose members were recruited
on the East Side. They were spoiling for a fight, and it became
necessary to post a sentry to preserve order.

A big husky Bowery recruit, of pugilistic propensities, was put on
guard outside, and given special orders to see that quiet reigned, and
above all things, if trouble came his way, not to lose possession of
his rifle.

Soon a general row began, growing in proportions as the minutes
passed. The soldier walked his post nervously, without interrupting,
until the corporal of the guard appeared on the scene with
reenforcements.

"Why didn't you stop this row?" shouted the corporal.

The sentry, balancing his rifle on his shoulder, raised his arms to
the correct boxing position, and replied:

"Sure, phwat could I do wid this gun in me hands!"

property of a farmer. In giving his evidence the farmer was
exceedingly careful, even nervous, and the solicitor for the defense
endeavored to frighten him. "Now," he remarked, "are you prepared to
swear that this man shot your pigeons?" "I didn't say he did shoot

caught him on my land wi' a gun. Secondly, I heerd a gun go off an'
saw some pigeons fall. Thirdly, I found four o' my pigeons in his
pocket--an' I don't think them birds flew there and committed

A red-faced man was holding the attention of a little group with some
wonderful recitals.

"The most exciting chase I ever had," he said, "happened a few years
ago in Russia. One night, when sleighing about ten miles from my
destination I discovered, to my intense horror, that I was being
followed by a pack of wolves. I fired blindly into the pack, killing
one of the brutes, and to my delight saw the others stop to devour it.
After doing this, however, they still came on. I kept on repeating the
dose, with the same result, and each occasion gave me an opportunity
to whip up my horse. Finally there was only one wolf left, yet on it
came, with its fierce eyes glowing in anticipation of a good, hot
supper."

Here the man who had been sitting in the corner burst forth into a fit
of laughter.

"Why, man," said he, "by your way of reckoning that last wolf must
have had the rest of the pack inside him!"

A traveling man stopped at an Indiana hotel. The proprietor told him
he had not a room in the house. The man said he must have a room.
Finally the proprietor told him there was a room, a little room
separated by a thin partition from a nervous man who had lived in the
house for ten years.

"He is so nervous," said the landlord, "I don't dare put any one in
that room. The least noise might give him a nervous spell that would
endanger his life."

"Oh, give me a room," said the traveler. "I'll be so quiet he'll not
know I'm there."

The room was given the traveler. He slipped in noiselessly and began
to disrobe. He took off one article of clothing after another as
quietly as a burglar. At last he came to his shoes. He unlaced a shoe
and dropped it.

The shoe fell to the floor with a great noise. The offending traveler,
horrified at what he had done, waited to hear from the nervous man.
Not a sound. He took off the second shoe and placed it noiselessly
upon the floor; then in absolute silence finished undressing and
crawled between the sheets.

Half an hour went by. He had dropped into a doze when there came a
tremendous knocking on the partition.

matter?" he asked.

There was once an Irishman, who sought employment as a diver, bringing
with him his native enthusiasm and a certain amount of experience.
Although he had never been beneath the water, he had crossed an ocean
of one variety and swallowed nearly an ocean of another. But he had
the Hibernian smile, which is convincing, and the firm chanced to need
a new man. And so on the following Monday morning Pat hid his smile
for the first time in a diving helmet.

Now, the job upon which the crew to which Pat had attached himself was
working in comparatively shallow water, and Pat was provided with a
pick and told to use it on a ledge below in a manner with which he was
already familiar.

Down he went with his pick, and for about fifteen minutes nothing was
heard from him. Then came a strong, determined, deliberate pull on the
signal rope, indicating that Pat had a very decided wish to come to
the top. The assistants pulled him hastily to the raft and removed his
helmet.

and exclaimed: "How do you do! Come right in. Don't mind the dog."

"But won't he bite?" exclaimed the friend, not anxious to meet the
canine without some assurance of his personal safety.

"That's just what I want to find out," exclaimed Mrs. Brown. "I just
bought him this morning."

Stopping to strop his razor, and prepared, with brush in hand to

"No, thanks," drawled Ralph, "It's hardly necessary. I think I can

The following is a typical Ian Maclaren story:

"Who had this place last year?" asked a Southern shooting tenant of
his keeper.

"Well," said Donald, "I'm not denyin' that he wass an Englishman, but
he wass a good man whatever. Oh, yess, he went to kirk and he shot
very well, but he wass narrow, very narrow."

"Narrow," said the other in amazement, for he supposed he meant
bigoted, and the charge was generally the other way about. "What was
he narrow in?"

"Well," said Donald, "I will be tellin' you, and it wass this way. The
twelfth [the beginning of the grouse shooting] wass a very good day,
and we had fifty-two brace. But it wass warm, oh! yess, very warm, and
when we came back to the Lodge, the gentleman will say to me, 'It is
warm.' and I will not be contradicting him. Then he will be saying,
'Maybe you are thirsty,' and I will not be contradicting him.
Afterwards he will take out his flask and be speaking about a dram. I
will not be contradicting him, but will just say, 'Toots, toots.' Then
he will be pouring it out, and when the glass wass maybe half-full I
will say, just for politeness, 'Stop.' And he stopped. Oh! yess, a
very narrow man."

Mark Twain as a humorist is no respecter of persons, and a story is
told of him and Bishop Doane which is worth repeating. It occurred
when Mark Twain was living in Hartford, where Mr. Doane was then
rector of an Episcopal church. Twain had listened to one of the
doctor's best sermons, on Sunday morning, when he approached him and
said politely: "I have enjoyed your sermon this morning. I welcomed it
as I would an old friend. I have a book in my library that contains
every word of it." "Impossible, sir," replied the rector, indignantly.
"Not at all. I assure you it is true," said Twain. "Then I shall
trouble you to send me that book," rejoined the rector with dignity.
The next morning Dr. Doane received, with Mark Twain's compliments, a
dictionary.

A friend of Mark Twain's tells of an amusing incident in connection
with the first meeting between the humorist and the late James McNeil
Whistler, the artist.

The friend having facetiously warned Clemens that the painter was a
confirmed joker, Mark solemnly averred that he would get the better of
Whistler should the latter attempt "any funny business." Furthermore,
Twain determined to anticipate Whistler, if possible.

So, when the two had been introduced, which event took place in
Whistler's studio, Clemens, assuming an air of hopeless stupidity,
approached a just-completed painting, and said:

"Not at all bad, Mr. Whistler, not at all bad. Only," he added,
reflectively, with a motion as if to rub out a cloud effect, "if I
were you I'd do away with that cloud."

"Great Heavens, sir!" exclaimed Whistler, almost beside himself. "Do
be careful not to touch that; the paint is not yet dry!"

"Oh, I don't mind that," responded Twain, with an air of perfect
nonchalance; "I am wearing gloves."

This is a story of Italian revenge. A vender of plaster statuettes saw
a chance for a sale in a well-dressed, bibulous man who was tacking
down the street.

"You buy-a de statuette?" he asked, alluringly holding out his
choicest offering. "Gar-r-ribaldi--I sell-a him verra cheep. De
gr-reat-a Gar-r-ribaldi--only thirta cents!"

"Oh, t'ell with Garibaldi," said the bibulous one, making a swipe with
his arm that sent Garibaldi crashing to the sidewalk.

For a moment the Italian regarded the fragments. Then, his eyes
flashing fire, he seized from his stock a statuette of George
Washington. "You t'ell-a with my Gar-r-ribaldi?" he hissed between his
teeth. "So." He raised the immortal George high above his head
and--crash! it flew into fragments alongside of the ill-fated
Garibaldi. "Ha! I to hell-a wid your George-a Wash! Ha, ha!"

It appears that the late Senator John T. Morgan, who was quite
near-sighted, while at dessert one evening in a hotel at Hot Springs,
Virginia, experienced considerable difficulty in separating from the
plate passed him by the colored waiter what he thought was a chocolate
eclair. It stuck fast, so Senator Morgan pushed his fork quite under
it, and tried again and again to pry it up.

Suddenly he became aware that his friends at the table were convulsed
with laughter, which much mystified him. But his surprise was even
greater when the waiter quietly remarked:

"Pardon me, Senator, but that's my thumb!"

reputation for ready wit and did not allow even his unfortunate love

"What do you say, doctor, to my giving the toast of Miss White, your

me by toasting her as often as you please, for I've toasted her all
these years and there are still no symptoms of her turning Brown."

One evening after she had been served with dessert this lady, who was
always complaining, asked the waiter why the dish served her was
called "ice-cream pudding."

"If you don't like it, ma'am, I'll bring you something else,"
suggested the polite negro.

"Oh, it's very nice," responded the lady. "What I object to is that it
should be called ice-cream pudding. It's wrongly named. There should
be ice cream served with it."

"Yes, ma'am," replied the waiter, "but that's jest our name for it.
Lots o' dishes that way. Dey don't bring you a cottage with cottage

During a certain cruise the first mate of a ship got to drinking to
excess and was intoxicated for several days. One day, after having
come out of this state, he examined the log book to see what had
passed during his period of semi-forgetfulness. He was horrified to
find entered in the book for the three days consecutively, "The first
mate is drunk to-day." He did not want this to stand as it would
hardly be a good recommendation for him to the ship owners and asked
the captain to remove the entries.

The captain replied, "It is the truth, is it not?" "Yes, but--"
replied the mate. The captain interrupted him, "If it is the truth,
the truth must stand. It is written in ink and can not be removed
without injuring the book."

A short time afterward the captain was taken ill and remained so for a
week, and it devolved upon the mate to keep the log book. The captain
on recovering from his illness got the book to examine it to see how
the mate had done his duty. Imagine his consternation when he read in
each of the seven days' entries, "The captain is sober to-day."

The captain immediately called the mate and indignantly questioned him
in regard to these entries. The mate replied, "It is the truth, is it
not?" "Yes, but--" replied the captain. The mate interrupted him, "If
it is the truth, the truth must stand, must it not? I have your word
that the writing in ink can not be erased."

'Next' at him two or three times when my chair was vacant, but he was

"'What do you want me to do?' he asked.

"'Why, get in the chair if you want anything,' I replied. 'This is a
barber shop.'

"'Oh, yes,' he said, and then he got into the chair. He leaned back,
so I let the chair down and shaved him. He didn't have a word to say.
When I finished him up he got out of the chair and took the check over
to the cashier. He paid and started out. When halfway through the door
he stopped.

"'Say,' he said to me, 'what did you do to me?'

"'I shaved you,' I said.

bustle and excitement of the London street, the hoi polloi, the
Billingsgate and the din and rattle were becoming almost unbearable

it inspire one with renewed vigor?" Casey leaned over, with hand to
his ear, and said, "You'll have to speak a little louder, Riley; I

not hear them pealing? Do they not imbue you with a feeling of almost
reverence? Do they not awaken tender memories of the past?" Casey
again leaned forward and said, "I can't hear you. You'll have to speak
louder." Riley got as close to him as possible and said, "Do you not
hear the melodious pealing of the chimes? Do they not recall the
salutation of old Trinity on a Sabbath morning? Do they not take you
back into the dim vistas of the past when the world was young, and
touch your heart with a feeling of pathos?" Casey put his mouth close

At a banquet held in a room the walls of which were adorned with many
beautiful paintings, a well-known college president was called upon to
respond to a toast. In the course of his remarks, wishing to pay a

one of his characteristic gestures, he said: "What need is there of
these painted beauties when we have so many with us at this table?"

The late Charles Eliot Norton was wont to deplore the modern youth's
preference of brawn to brain. He used to tell of a football game he
once witnessed: "Princeton had a splendid player in Poe--you will
remember little Poe?" and Professor Norton, thinking of "The Raven"
and "Annabel Lee," said to the lad at his side: "He plays well, that
Poe!"

"Doesn't he?" the youth cried. "Is he," said Professor Norton, "any
relation to the great Poe?"

"Any relation?" said the youth. "Why, he is the great Poe."

A fire broke out one day in Francis Wilson's dressing-room at the
theater where he was playing.

He had some of his books around him, and in an agony of despair asked
himself:

"Which shall I save?" He glanced at his precious Chaucer, at some
Shakespearean volumes, when:

"Come, Mr. Wilson," broke in at the door from a fireman, "you have not
a moment to lose."

"Yes, yes. Coming," replied Wilson absently.

He was looking for a special illuminated volume very dear to him.

"Come, Wilson," cried his manager; "come, get out!"

"All right, all right," said Wilson, and, grabbing some clothes in one
hand, he snatched with the other the nearest volume and ran to the
street. There he looked at the huge volume in his arms. It was the
city directory.

A city gentleman was recently invited down to the country for "a day
with the birds." His aim was not remarkable for its accuracy, to the
great disgust of the man in attendance, whose tip was generally
regulated by the size of the bag.

"Dear me!" at last exclaimed the sportsman, "but the birds seem
exceptionally strong on the wing this year."

"Not all of 'em, sir," was the answer. "You've shot at the same bird
about a dozen times. 'E's a-follerin' you about, sir."

"Following me about? Nonsense! Why should a bird do that?"

"Well, sir," came the reply. "I dunno, I'm sure, unless 'e's 'angin'
'round you for safety."

A lady was calling on some friends one summer afternoon. The talk
buzzed along briskly, fans waved and the daughter of the house kept
twitching uncomfortably, frowning and making little smothered
exclamations of annoyance. Finally, with a sigh, she rose and left the
room.

"Your daughter," said the visitor, "seems to be suffering from the
heat."

"No," said the hostess. "She is just back home from college and she is
suffering from the family grammar."

"It ain't everybody I'd put to sleep in this room," said old Mrs.
Jinks to the fastidious and extremely nervous young minister who was
spending a night at her house.

"This here room is full of sacred associations to me," she went on, as
she bustled around opening shutters and arranging the curtains. "My
first husband died in that bed with his head on these very pillers,
and poor Mr. Jinks died settin' right in that corner. Sometimes when I
come into the room in the dark I think I see him settin' there still.

"My own father died layin' right on that lounge under the winder. Poor
pa! He was a Speeritualist, and he allus said he'd appear in this room
after he died, and sometimes I'm foolish enough to look for him. If
you should see anything of him to-night you'd better not tell me; for
it'd be a sign to me that there was something in Speeritualism, and
I'd hate to think that.

Mr. George Broadhurst, author of the play, "The Man of the Hour," is
an Englishman, and recently made a visit to his native country. After
having lived a week at one of the large hotels in London, he was
surprised on the evening of his departure, although at a very late
hour, to see an endless procession of waiters, maids, porters, and
pages come forward with the expectant smile and empty hand. When each
and all had been well bestowed, even boots and under-boots and then
another boots, he dashed for the four-wheeler that was to carry him
safely away.

Settling himself with a sigh of relief, he was about to be off when a
page popped his head into the window and breathlessly exclaimed:

"I beg pardon, sir, but the night-lift man says he's waiting for a
message from you, sir."

"A message from me?"

"Yes, sir; he says he cawn't go to sleep without a message from you,
sir."

"Really, he can't go to sleep without a message from me?"

"No, sir."

"How touching. Then tell him, 'Pleasant dreams.'"

adding: "There are three ladies who wish it," meaning Mrs. Tennyson
and the two guests who were in the house.

"There are three other ladies who oppose it," Sir Edward answered.

"Who are they?" Tennyson asked.

"The Fates," Sir Edward replied.

"The Fates may be on one side," Tennyson rejoined, "but the Graces are
on the other."

Mr. Brown, a Kansas gentleman, is the proprietor of a boarding-house.
Around his table at a recent dinner sat his wife, Mrs. Brown; the
village milliner, Mrs. Andrews; Mr. Black, the baker; Mr. Jordan, a
carpenter; and Mr. Hadley, a flour, feed, and lumber merchant. Mr.
Brown took a ten-dollar bill out of his pocketbook and handed it to
Mrs. Brown, with the remark that there was ten dollars toward the
twenty he had promised her. Mrs. Brown handed the bill to Mrs.
Andrews, the milliner, saying, "That pays for my new bonnet." Mrs.
Andrews, in turn, passed it on to Mr. Jordan, remarking that it would
pay for the carpentry work he had done for her. Mr. Jordan handed it
to Mr. Hadley, requesting his receipted bill for flour, feed, and
lumber. Mr. Hadley gave the bill back to Mr. Brown, saying, "That pays
ten dollars on my board." Mr. Brown again passed it to Mrs. Brown,
remarking that he had now paid her the twenty dollars he had promised
her. She, in turn, paid it to Mr. Black to settle her bread and pastry
account. Mr. Black handed it to Mr. Hadley, asking credit for the
amount on his flour bill, Mr. Hadley again returning it to Mr. Brown,
with the remark that it settled for that month's board; whereupon
Brown put it back into his pocketbook, observing that he had not
supposed a greenback would go so far.

A doctor came up to a patient in an insane asylum, slapped him on the
back, and said: "Well, old man, you're all right, you can run along
and write your folks that you'll be back home in two weeks as good as
new." The patient went off gaily to write his letter. He had it
finished and sealed, but when he was licking the stamp it slipped
through his fingers to the floor, lighted on the back of a cockroach
that was passing and stuck. The patient hadn't seen the
cockroach--what he did see was his escaped postage stamp zig-zagging
aimlessly across the floor to the baseboard, wavering up over the
baseboard and following a crooked track up the wall and across the
ceiling. In depressed silence he tore up the letter and dropped the
pieces on the floor. "Two weeks! Hell!" he said. "I won't be out of
here in three years."

quite a portly fellow) noticed that a certain young woman had a grip
exactly like his, but that it was placed with the rest of the luggage,
on top. Thinking there might be some mistake made he kept his inside
and placed it at his feet. He was soon engrossed in his paper, and did

side. Being of a humorous turn of mind he waited until she was
occupied with a book and then pulled the grip to its former position,
the rest of the travelers looking on with amused expressions.

In turning over a leaf she looked down and suddenly became aware of
the removal of the grip. She was quite indignant, and with some force
in her voice and manner said, "That is _mine_!" and jerked it back

President Eliot, of Harvard, is not a believer in spelling reform. Not
long ago there was a student who was a candidate for the degree of
doctor of philosophy. This student had adopted spelling reform as his
particular line of work, and as commencement day drew near he went to
President Eliot with a request. "You know, Mr. President," he said
"that you are proposing to make me a Ph.D. Now I have made a specialty
of spelling reform and I always spell philosophy with an 'f.' I
therefore called to ask you if you could not make my degree F. D.,
instead of Ph.D."

The following letter was received by the Post-office Department. It
came from a Western postmaster at a small office and read: "In
accordance with the rules of the department, I write you to inform you
that on next Saturday I will close the post-office for one day, as I
am going on a bear hunt. I am not asking your permission to close up
and don't give a damn if you discharge me; but I will advise now, that
I am the only man in the county who can read and write."

A young lady at a summer hotel asked an artist friend, who was
spending his vacation there, if he would mind doing a small favor for
her.

"Certainly not," he said eagerly; "what is it?"

"Thank you so much," she exclaimed gratefully. "I wish you would stop
at Mrs. Gannon's little shop and get three large bone buttons, the
kind with two small holes in them. They're for my new bathing suit,
you know. Just tell her who I am and it will be all right. You needn't
pay for them."

Now the artist was a bachelor, and had never bought anything but
collar buttons before. So on the way to the store he kept repeating
the instructions that he had received. Eager to relieve his mind he
rushed up to Mrs. Gannon and reeled off this surprising speech: "I
want three bone buttons for a small bathing suit with two large holes
in it. Just tell me who I am and it will be all right."

There was not even standing room in the six-o'clock crowded car, but
one more passenger, a young woman, wedged her way along just inside

said quietly: "Hadn't you better stay here now?"

outlandish calico costume of the mountains, was summoned as a witness
in court to tell what she knew about a fight in her house. She took
the witness-stand with evidences of backwardness and proverbial
Bourbon verdancy. The Judge asked her in a kindly voice what took
place. She insisted it did not amount to much, but the Judge by his
persistency finally got her to tell the story of the bloody fracas.

"Now, I tell ye, Jedge, it didn't amount to nuthn'. The fust I knowed

him down with a stick o' wood. One o' Bill's friends then cut Tom with

necktie, his wife met him at the door with the exclamation: "There,

"Not at all, my dear fellow," Mr. Gibson responded. "But I was just

Going into a port where the water was very deep--Rio de Janeiro, I

the expression is, control was lost, and shackle after shackle tore
out of the hawse-holes with tremendous rattling and roaring. The

he means by letting such things happen." Alfred was a mild person, and
clearly did not like his job; he could not have come up to the
admiral's standard. The latter saw it, and said: "Perhaps you had
better leave it to me. I'll settle him." Fixing his eyes on the
offender, he said, sternly: "What do you mean by this, sir? Why the
hell didn't you stop that chain?" The culprit looked quietly at him
and said: "How the hell could I?" After a moment the admiral turned to

me. Will some gentleman kindly loan me a pint flask of whisky?" Then a
lank man in the rear of the hall arose. "Mistah," said he, "will a
quart flask do?" "Just as well, sir," replied the magician, and every
gentleman in the hall arose with flask extended.

"Phoebe," said a mistress in reproof to her colored servant whom she
found smoking a short pipe after having repeatedly threatened to
discharge her if again caught in the act, "if you won't stop that bad
habit for any other reason do so because it is right. You are a good
church member--and, don't you know that smoking makes the breath
unpleasant, and that nothing unclean can enter Heaven?" "'Deed,
missie, I does," said the woman, "but bress' yo' heart, when I go to
Heaben I'll leave my bref behin'."

It was the custom of a certain deacon, when dining at the home of one
of his best friends, to drink a glass of milk, as a prelude to his
dinner. One day when the minister was scheduled to appear, instead of
the rich, foamy glass of milk, his friend placed beside his plate a
glass of milk punch. After the blessing, the deacon seized his glass
and drank to the last drop, and then exclaimed as he closed his eyes
and smacked his lips, "_Oh_, what a cow!"

Dean Hole of Rochester, England, told of a very innocent and obliging
curate who went to a Yorkshire parish where many of the parishioners
bred horses and sometimes raced them. A few Sundays after his arrival
he was asked to invite the prayers of the congregation for Lucy Grey.
He did so. They prayed for three Sundays for her. On the fourth, the
church clerk told the curate that he need not do it any more. "Why,"
he asked, "is she dead?" "No," said the clerk, "she's won the
steeplechase."

The late Richard Henry Stoddard while endeavoring to procure an
impromptu luncheon for a number of his friends after his wife and the
servants had retired, found a box of sardines. His vigorous remarks,
inspired by the sardine-can's objections to the "open sesame" of a
dull jack-knife, attracted the attention of Mrs. Stoddard on the floor
above.

"What _are_ you doing?" she called down.

"Opening a can of sardines."

"With what?"

"A dashed old jack-knife," cried the exasperated poet; "what did you
think I was opening it with?"

"Well, dear," she answered, "I didn't think you were opening it with
prayer."

Colored people are proverbially fond of funerals, and Mrs. Walker's
cook was trying to make her mistress realize what she had missed by
not attending the funeral of a prominent citizen of their village.

"Mis' Fanny," she said, "you sholy orto hev been thar. I ain' nevvah

William Bourke Cochran took his seat in Congress on the day that the
House went into turmoil over the special report on post-office
affairs. "I suppose it looks like old times to you, Cochran," said a
friend, who, with others, had crowded around to welcome him back. Just
then such epithets as "coward," "knave," "scoundrel," and "liar,"
hurtled across the chamber. "Well, I can't say it looks much like old
times," replied Cochran, "too many new faces for that. But it
certainly sounds like old times."

This happened in Scotland: The last edition of the newspapers had been
sold out and the newsboys were calculating their takings. "Hallo,"
said Jimmy, in alarm, "I'm a 'a'penny short!" "Well, wats the use of

Tolstoy told Isabel Habgard, who has translated many of his books, a
good story of one of his ancestors, an army officer, who was an
excellent mimic. One day he was impersonating the Emperor Paul to a
group of his friends, when Paul himself entered, and for some moments
looked on, unperceived, at the antics of the young man. Tolstoy
finally turned, and beholding the emperor, bowed his head and was
silent. "Go on, sir," said Paul; "continue the performance." The young
man hesitated a moment, and then, folding his arms and imitating every
gesture and intonation of his sovereign, he said: "Tolstoy, you
deserve to be degraded, but I remember the thoughtlessness of youth,
and you are pardoned." The czar smiling, said, "Well, be it so."

When President Nicholas Murray Butler was at college, certain freshmen
of his time made no scruple of stealing a pail of milk which a
dairyman daily placed outside the door of Mr. Butler's room while the
occupant was in class. In order to foil the boys, Mr. Butler printed a
sign in big letters, "I have poisoned this milk with arsenic." Upon
his return he found the milk intact, but added to the notice were
these words: "So have we."

There is an amusing story told of a clergyman, who, upon one of his
trips through the West, observed that almost every man he met and
spoke with used profanity. Finally he found one man who talked to him
for twenty minutes without using an oath. The clergyman shook hands
with him at parting and said: "You don't know how glad I am to have a
chance to have a talk with a man like you. You are the first man I
have met for three days who could talk for five minutes without
swearing." The stranger, shocked, instantly and innocently ejaculated:
"Well, I'll be d----d!"

The other day, while shopping, a lady accidentally picked up another
lady's umbrella from the counter, and had the mistake pointed out to
her in a rather frigid manner. She returned the umbrella with
apologies, and then remembered that she had no umbrella with her.

As it had begun to rain, she bought one, as well as one for a birthday
present for a friend. With the two umbrellas in her hand, she boarded
a car and, as luck would have it, sat down opposite the lady whose
umbrella she had picked up earlier in the store. As the latter swept
out of the car she smiled again frigidly, and remarked to the lady of
the umbrellas, "I see you have had a successful day."

A summer tourist was passing through a German village in the West

A university of Illinois professor is very popular among the students.
He was entertaining a group of them at his residence one night. Taking
down a magnificent sword that hung over the fireplace, he brandished
it about, exclaiming, "Never will I forget the day I drew this blade
for the first time." "Where did you draw it, sir?" an awe-struck
freshman asked. "At a raffle," said the professor.

In the vicinity of Germantown there lived a worthy old lady and her

dinner during Quarterly meeting. As John began to carve the broiled

midst of his flattering utterances his mother, who was somewhat deaf,
piped up from the other end of the table: "You needn't be praisin' of

chocolate before coming to church?" To this, madame, unabashed,
graciously replied: "Yes, mon pere; and two rolls with it."

Of late years the House of Commons has seen some lively times. Many of
them have been brought about by the irascible but delightful Irish
member, Dr. Tanner. On one occasion, when he had been indulging rather
freely and his ever ready tongue being loosened, he met Sir Ellis
Ashmead Bartlett in the lobby, and taking him to one side he said, in
the greatest confidence, and without the slightest tinge of anger, but
with a world of meaning: "Bartlett, you are a fool." "You are drunk,"
retorted the knight. "That's all right," replied Dr. Tanner.
"To-morrow I shall be sober, but you will still be a fool."

An old negro living in Carrollton was taken ill recently, and called
in a physician of his race to prescribe for him. But the old man did
not seem to be getting any better, and finally a white physician was
called. Soon after arriving Dr. S---- felt the darky's pulse for a
moment, and then examined his tongue. "Did your other doctor take your
temperature?" he asked. "I don't know, sah," he answered, feebly; "I
haint missed nuthin' but mah watch yit, boss."

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United

considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
