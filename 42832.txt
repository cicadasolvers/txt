PREFACE.


I have been induced to present this Volume to the Public by two
considerations. The figures and descriptions contained in the works
entitled "The Birds of America," and "Ornithological Biography, or an
Account of the Habits of the Birds of the United States," having been
issued in the miscellaneous manner which was thought best adapted to
the occasion, or which was rendered necessary by circumstances, seemed
to require a systematic index, in which the nomenclature should be
corrected, and the species arranged agreeably to my present views.
This Synopsis, then, will afford a methodical catalogue of all the
species hitherto discovered in the vast regions, extending from the
northern confines of Mexico to the Polar Seas, and which have been
described, and, with few exceptions, depicted in the works above
named. Another important object has been to present an arrangement of
these birds, so characterized, that a person desirous of studying
them, might, without much difficulty, be enabled to discover their
names, and trace some of the most important features in their
organization.

The species are disposed into genera and families; and, although the
location of the groups is not such as, in all respects, to satisfy
me, the arrangement will, I trust, be found in some degree useful. It
will be seen that, although I have adopted many of the modern groups,
I have not sectioned our birds on so minutely divided a scale as that
employed by some recent writers. Besides the characters of the
Families, Genera, and Species, which are given with considerable
detail, I have presented a short account of the Geographical
Distribution of the species, and references to the principal authors
by whom they have been described. I am confident that these notices
will suffice to enable the student to determine with certainty any
species that may come under his consideration, and that the
information respecting its habits, which he will find in the works
referred to, will afford him at least sufficient knowledge to form a
basis for the more extended observation which he may contemplate. To
the name of the genus I have appended that of the author by whom it
has been instituted; and with the specific names I have dealt in the
same manner, giving as authorities the individuals who first employed
them, although they may have referred them to different genera. It is
probable that many errors have been made in this department; but I
shall be happy to see them corrected, as my wish is to do justice to
all.

On this occasion I have again to acknowledge the benefit derived from
the aid of my friend Mr Macgillivray, whose general knowledge of
ornithology, and perfect candour, have rendered his advice peculiarly
valuable.

14. 2. Haliaetus leucocephalus, Linn. White-headed Sea-Eagle.--Bald
Eagle.

     Plate XXXI. Adult Male. Plate CXXVI. Young.

Male. Tarsus with a few scutella; toes terminally scutellate. Male
with the bill, cere, iris, and feet yellow; the head, the neck for
half its length, the rump, upper and lower tail-coverts, and tail
white; the rest of the plumage chocolate-brown, the terminal margins
of all the feathers pale greyish-brown. Female similar. Young with the
bill brownish-black, iris dark brown, feet yellow; the general colour
of the plumage very dark chocolate, uniform, the feathers without
edgings, all white at the base, that colour appearing more or less on
the hind part, and more especially on the fore part and sides of the
neck, and on the sides of the body and lower wing-coverts; quills and
tail-feathers brownish-black, tinged with grey toward the base; the
latter with the greater part of the inner webs, and a portion of the
outer brownish-white, freckled with dusky. In more advanced stages the
colours of the plumage vary considerably in different individuals. The
general tint continues brown for several years, a variable and often a
large proportion of white, or brownish-white, appearing on the neck,
the lower part of the body, the sides, and under the wings, the tail
meanwhile gradually becoming white in freckled patches, some have a
large patch of brownish-white across the breast. When the feathers are
new, they are of a glossy deep brown, but when old and worn they
present a bleached appearance, and the upper parts are often patched
with pale brown or brownish-white. On account of these circumstances,
individuals of different ages, and shot at different periods of the
year, differ so much from each other in appearance, that one might,
without a very extended comparison, conceive that in a collection of
specimens, there might be several species. The bill remains dark until
the head and tail become white; the anterior tarsal scutella differ
from none to six, the posterior from nine to twelve; those on the hind
toe are four, on the middle toe from nine to thirteen.

     Plate LXXV. Young Male and Female. Plate XCII. Adult Male.

Wings from two to three inches shorter than the tail, on the middle
feathers of which are five, on the lateral six broad whitish bands.
Adult male with the cere greenish-yellow, the feet pale orange, the
upper parts light bluish-grey, each feather with a black central line;
lower parts reddish or yellowish white, the breast and sides with
large oblong brown spots; tibial feathers light red, streaked with

pale red, throat white, lower parts pale red, streaked with brown. The
tail-bands vary from pale red to white.

This species is so nearly allied to _Falco Aesalon_, that it is
extremely difficult to distinguish many individuals. The number and
form of the scutella differ; but the most certain distinctive
character is found in the light-coloured bands of the tail, which are
more numerous in the Merlin, there being seven on its middle, and nine
on its lateral tail-feathers.

34. 1. Strix Americana, Aud. American Screech-Owl.--Barn Owl.

     Plate CLXXI. Male and Female.

Feathers margining the operculum with the shaft and webs undeveloped.
Bill pale greyish-yellow; claws and scales brownish-yellow. General
colour of upper parts greyish-brown, with light yellowish-red
interspersed, produced by very minute mottling; each feather having
toward the end a central streak of deep brown, terminated by a small
oblong greyish-white spot; wings similarly coloured; secondary coverts
and outer edges of primary coverts with a large proportion of light

Closely allied to _Strix flammea_, but larger, and differing somewhat
in colour, being generally darker, with the ruff red. A character by
which they may always be distinguished is found in the operculum, the
feathers margining which are in the present species reduced to their
tubes, the shafts and filaments being wanting, whereas in the European
species each tube bears a very slender shaft, about half an inch long,
and furnished with about half a dozen filaments on each side.

Outer four quills nearly equal, second longest; tail slightly
emarginate. Male with the upper parts bluish ash-grey, streaked with
black; crown, rump, upper part of throat, and a patch on the sides of
the body, rich yellow; first row of small coverts largely tipped, and
secondary coverts broadly margined and tipped with white, which thus
forms a conspicuous patch on the wing; quills and tail brownish-black,
narrowly margined with greyish-white; a patch of white on the inner
webs of all the tail-feathers, but on the central reduced to a mere
edging; a small white spot on each of the eyelids; loral space and
cheek black; lower part of neck anteriorly, fore part of breast, and
sides, variegated with black and white or ash-grey, the latter colours
margining the feathers; the rest of the lower parts white. Female
without the yellow spot on the crown, although the feathers there are
tinged with that colour at the base; upper parts light brownish-grey,
streaked with dusky; lower parts whitish, tinged with brown, and
streaked with dusky; throat and rump yellow, but of a lighter tint
than in the male, and but slight indications of the yellow patch on
the sides; there is much less white on the wings, and the white
patches on the tail-feathers are of less extent.

In size, form, and proportion, this species and _Sylvicola coronata_
are almost precisely similar; and their colours are almost exactly
alike, the only remarkable difference in this respect being, that the
throat of the present species is yellow, while that of the former is
white.

This species forms a connecting link between _Sylvicola_ and
_Trichas_, having the long pointed wings of the former, and the
general appearance of the latter, which it resembles, especially in
its tail, which is neither emarginate, nor marked with the white spots
seen on that of almost all the other Sylvicolae, but which do not exist
in the genus Trichas. Some of the Sylvicolae are, in like manner,
assimilated to Myiodoctes, and others to Vermivora. Of the former may
be mentioned, _Sylvicola Auduboni_ and _S. coronata_; of the latter,
_S. Blackburniae_.

FAMILY XI. SYLVIANAE. WARBLERS.


Bill of moderate length, slender, straight, a little broader than high
at the base, compressed toward the end; upper mandible with its dorsal
line straight and declinate, convex at the end, the tip small, acute,
the notches small; lower mandible with the angle of moderate length
and narrow, the dorsal line straight, the sides convex, the tip
narrow. Nostrils basal, oval or oblong. Head rather large, ovate; neck
short; body rather slender. Feet of ordinary length, slender; tarsus
compressed, with seven anterior scutella; toes moderate, compressed;
first stouter, second and fourth nearly equal, third much longer, and
adherent at the base; claws moderate, arched, slender, compressed,
acute. Plumage soft and blended. Bristles short or weak. Wings of
moderate length or long; the first quill very small, the second,
third, and fourth longest. Tail long or of moderate length, of twelve
feathers. Tongue, sagittate, slender, tapering to a slit and lacerated
point. Oesophagus rather narrow, without crop; proventriculus
oblong; stomach a gizzard of moderate strength, with the muscles
distinct, the epithelium dense and rugous; intestine of moderate

Of this family, which in Europe is so numerous, there are in North
America only two genera, _Regulus_ and _Sialia_, the former composed
of very small birds, allied in manners to the Tits, the latter
approaching the Thrushes in form. The connecting links being wanting
with us, these genera might seem at first sight very dissimilar.

This species is nearly allied to _Anthus aquaticus_ and _A.
pratensis_, more especially to the latter, from which it is
distinguished by having the bill much stouter, the tarsus longer, the
hind claws stouter, more curved, and much shorter, the colour of the
feet much darker, in being always much more rufous beneath, and in
sometimes, when the summer is advanced, being almost entirely
unspotted there. From _A. aquaticus_ it is at once distinguished by
the whitish band over the eye, and the white on the outer
tail-feathers. It indeed seems wonderful that any ornithologist should
have mistaken it for that species.

Fourth quill longest, third little shorter, second shorter than sixth,
first half the length of second; tail long, graduated; bill
brownish-black at the end, paler towards the base; upper parts light
ash-grey, the ends of the scapulars and the upper tail-coverts
grayish-white; a streak of whitish over the eye; loral space and a
patch behind the eye brownish-black; first row of smaller
wing-coverts, larger coverts, and quills, brownish-black; secondary
quills and coverts edged and tipped with whitish; base of primaries
white, forming a conspicuous patch, when the wing is extended;
tail-feathers brownish-black, outer web of lateral feathers, and more
than a third of its inner web from the tip, white; the extremities of
all the rest, excepting the middle two, also white, gradually
occupying less extent on the inner feathers; lower parts
greyish-white, the fore part of the breast tinged with brown, and
faintly marked with transverse undulating lines of dark grey, as are
the sides. Female similar, but with the head and neck slightly tinged
with brown, and the lower parts more banded.

_Lanius Excubitor_ differs in being considerably smaller, and in
having the white on the wings and tail more extended, the bases and a
great portion of the inner webs of the secondaries, except the inner
three, being of that colour, as well as the bases of the primaries,
and forming a conspicuous spot when the wing is closed, and the outer
tail-feathers being often white in their whole length.

_Male_, 10-2/12, 14-2/12.

Breeds from Pennsylvania northward. During winter, migrates westward
to the Mississippi, and as far south as Natchez. Not uncommon.

Bill black, feet bluish-grey. In summer the upper part of head, fore
part of back, and scapulars variegated with brownish-black and bright
yellow, the latter in spots along the edges of the feathers; rump with
smaller spots, two on each feather; quills and coverts dark
greyish-brown, secondaries paler, the inner margined with
yellowish-white spots, the smaller coverts spotted with the same;
tail-feathers greyish-brown, faintly banded with paler, the two
central with marginal yellowish spots; a broad band of white across

species, which closely resembles _Charadrius pluvialis_, is
distinguishable by having the tarsus slightly longer, the toes
somewhat shorter, and the axillar feathers always light grey, they
being white in that species, which very probably exists in North

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
