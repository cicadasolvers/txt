Foreword


PEGASUS _is a queer old nag, and many of his would-be riders find him
most unruly. We mount him and are off for a wee nip of Hippocrene. We
want him to lazy along like a plough horse, while we pluck daisies, but
he insists on demonstrating that, like a Hambletonian, he has all of the
High School gaits. And when we pass the Queen's carriage, expecting him
to step stately and look like a million dollars, the old plug stumbles
and limps, and is classed by all as a casual. So please, please blame
the horse--and not the rider._




Dedication


_To the boys who have found the old War Horse a dangerous animal, have
come to cropper in the Big Muss, and are now assigned to bunk fatigue,
we offer these rhymes. Though, they are crippled; and limp, and halt,
and stumble at times--yet we trust they may, for all that, break through
when General Monotony is entertaining a company of Blue Devils, and for
a few moments, at least, put to rout serious and somber thoughts._

_To the casuals now enjoying hospital hospitality at Kenilworth
(Biltmore) and Oteen (Azalea), this jumble of rhymes is dedicated._

_Pick it up, Buddy, it's a dud._

Greetings

_A New Year Greeting in which the Jumbler hopes to meet you soon._


    My wish most dear for your New Year
      I'm quite sincere in giving;
    When next we meet, on Easy Street
      I hope that you'll be living.

    P. S.--_And I hope I meet you soon._




Introspection

_The old nag_, PEGASUS, _invites the Jumbler to an introspective mood as
he lopes along. It is Thanksgiving, 1917._


    Am I thankful?
    Let-me-see--
    World, Flesh, Devil
    Good to me;
    Friends still loyal,
    Coin in banks--
    Stop this minute!
    I'll give thanks.

    What of troubles
    Lately past?
    Well, at least they
    Didn't last.
    Not a single
    Scar remains,
    Nor remembrance
    Of the pains.

    So, I'm thinking
    That from me
    There is due great
    Gobs of glee.
    Though a slacker,
    From this day
    I'll be grateful--
    Let us Pray!

An Acknowledgment

(From Him to Her).

_The receipt of a gift he cannot label leads the Jumbler to recite:_


    I thank you for the hickeydee,
      The thingamabob you sent;
    The trickamadoo's the very thing
      On which my heart was bent.

    The dofunny's style and color
      Puts all dodads to shame;
    The jiggermaree's the swellest thing
      That ever bore that name.

    Appreciation's most sincere,
      But I'll no longer lie--
    Pray be a sport and tell me quick:
      What is the thing?--and why?




Pay! Pay!! Pay!!!

_In which the Jumbler notes the profusion and the pertinacity of the
Pauls and the pitiful paucity of Peters._


    I'm daily robbing Peter for to pay
        Old Mr. Paul;
    I swear it's hard them both to
        satisfy;
    Pauls in legions me pursue, but the
        Peters are so few--
    I lie awake at night and wonder why.

    The hope of every Peter is some day
        to be a Paul.
    Then little Peters must be set to
        sprout.
    Ev'ry chance of Paul for pay would
        forever pass away
    The day the tribe of Peter
        petered out.




Taffy and the Man

_As a member of the Taffy Consumers' League, the Jumbler offers this bit
of defence:_


    I have eaten grits and gravy in the Southland now and then,
      I have lived on California's luscious fruits;
    I've inhaled long-stringed spaghetti in Italia, and again
      In the Klondike once I dined on cowhide boots.

    Of course I've supped at Rector's, at the Cecil, and the rest;
      Tackled truffles and de foie gras in Paree;
    I have bolted guava jelly and tortillas, Madrid's best,
      And I've chop-sticked bird's-nest soup a la Chinee.

    But of all the palate-ticklers on the whole world's bill of fare,
      Whether ladled out at morning, night or noon,
    Not a gustatory stimulant that I know can compare
      With a little dab of taffy on a spoon.

[Illustration]

    If a man is grouched or peevish, if in doling cash he's slow--
      Just a little bit of taffy--presto! won!!
    Every married woman knows it--every girlie ought to know:
      If you feed a man of taffy he's undone.

    When a man tries introspection, then he stacks up mighty small;
      So he keeps from this self-searching all he can;
    Yet a feeling lies inherent, never's lost in him at all,
      That he'd like to be a bigger, better man.

    So when other people tell him that he's bigger, nicer far,
      Or a better chap than he himself can see,
    There is worked a transformation and his stock goes way 'bove par,
      And he feels the man he'd really like to be.

    It's not Vanity that does it, but his Better Self you view
      As he smiles and purrs and pleases all he can.
    As a corking good investment I would hand this tip to you:
      Just try always feeding taffy to a man.

    Do not stinge nor be too saving, don't conserve this priceless boon,
      But feed as though you had an endless store;
    With an appetite voracious he will gulp it from the spoon,
      And when all's gone he'll loudly cry for more.




Myself vs. Me

_Some serious thoughts on the psychology of Respectability._


    My life is one long battle,
      Between Myself and Me;
    I see the right, yet do the wrong--
      This much too frequently.

    I have the foolish habit,
      That oft brings me disgrace,
    Of cutting off my Roman nose
      To spite my ugly face.

    I'm daily robbing Peter
      To pay Old Mister Paul--
    Though cosmos out of chaos
      It never makes at all.

    I jump out of the skillet
      Into the fire that's hot;
    With fingers burned I dread the blaze.
      But quit it? I guess not!

    And so goes on the battle
      Between Myself and Me--
    Old Satan pulling fiercely 'gainst
      Respectability?

To "The Quiet Observer"

_An appreciation--wherein the Jumbler indites the following to the space
writer who quotes from him and Riley._


    I sat me down in pride to gloat
    Upon the column that you wrote,
    In which you, sir, were pleased to quote
    From me and Riley--
        From me and him,
            From me and Jim,
                From me and Riley.

    The _tout ensemble_ did impel
    My manly chest to heave and swell;
    The combination "liked me well;"
    Me, you and Riley.
        It seemed a great
            Triumvirate--
                ME, YOU and RILEY.

    But soon in deep humility
    My head was bowed, and I could see
    The difference 'tween little ^{me}
    And You and Riley.
        I lacked the art
            To touch the heart
                Like you and Riley.

    You seem to write with greatest ease,
    Of cheerful mien, of birds and bees,
    And out-of-doorsy things one sees--
    And so does Riley.
        With master-stroke,
            To common folk
                Write you and Riley.

    I take a hack-saw and a square
    And cut my rhymes with greatest care;
    'Tis harder work for me, I swear,
    Than you and Riley.
        And yet I fail
            To hit the nail
                Like you and Riley.

    You write in prose--a rhymer he--
    And yet 't has always seemed to me
    Your souls alike must surely be--
    Yours, sir, and Riley's.
        You love each thing
            Of which you sing--
                Do you and Riley.




A bas Polyanna!

_Wherein the Jumbler finds the Cheeruptimistic Lore a bore._


I hate the Pollyanna cult! Cheeruptimistic lore, that now confronts at
every turn, long since became a bore. In daily press, in magazines, in
every thing I read, the sugar-coated life's prescribed as man's most
urgent need. 'Tis O be joyful, grin and smile, let tears be left unshed;
just purr and sing the whole day long, then pass it on ahead! If grandma
dies or cook takes leave or father breaks a leg, be glad, be glad; and
if you're broke, why, whistle as you beg! Now I, for one, refuse to live
a grinning Cheshire cat. I'm just as human, mad as glad--a fool can tell
you that. All sunshine makes a desert waste, and honey-words soon pall;
because someone's in harder luck can't make me glad at all. A man has
special muscles just to corrugate his brow; the Lord knew when he
fashioned them that they'd be used, and how. I want my friends without
veneer, straightforward as can be; and I will grant them outlet for
innate depravity. Why bluff and play that grief's not real? Why blush to
shed a tear? A temper may be lost and found, with Paradise still near.
No need to gloom or grouch or fret, no need to howl or whine; but may
the right to voice a grief or own a pain be mine.




If You'd Marry

_Advice to wimmin "On Marriage," by the Jumbler._


[Illustration]

    If the fish won't take your bait,
          Do not tarry.
    'Twill never do to sit and wait,
          If you'd marry.
    Gather up your hook and line,
    Somewhere 'round the water's fine;
    Change your bait and keep on tryin'!
          That's the system!

    Should one rise in reach of you,
          Oh, be prayerful!
    Take your gaff and run him through,
          But be careful!
    Hold him tight for all you're worth,
    Of marryin' men there's now a dearth,
    And then--there're widows still on earth!!
          Curses on 'em!

    If a widow steals a beau
          That you're landing,
    Practice up a knock-out blow--
          Him demanding.
    A perfect lady, though you've been,
    Just you cave her features in!
    Killin' widows ain't no sin--
          Never will be!




To My Valentine

_The Jumbler, with one eye on the calendar, tells the thoughts he
thinks--claiming immunity the while._


    Saint Valentine, that good old gink,
    Gives license free to say with ink
    The things you feel, the thoughts you think.

    So timid youths, of courts afraid,
    Select this day to tell a maid
    Things otherwise best left unsaid.

    This custom all the judges know,
    And breach-of-promise suits don't go--
    So that's "how comes" what's writ below:

    I love you, dear, to beat the Dutch!
    I love you, dear, gosh-awful much!
    Now could you love, obey--and such?

    With love my heart seems 'bout to burst--
    But I've now said all that I durst.
        With love to all,--_John Safety First_.

[Illustration]




     _The Jumbler again mounts_ PEGASUS, _and carries us through the
     Realm of Dreams, where we come in touch with the Life Romantic._

     _The Jumbler recites:_

     ALL MINE IN DREAMS.

     SHOULD DREAMS COME TRUE.

     LOTUS EATING.




All Mine in Dreams

_The Jumbler, thinking of "The Little House," also thinks of a little
house-keeper._


    O little girl with wondrous eyes
      And charms of Graces Three!
    "How have you come, why have you come
      To mean so much to me?"
    Unrest within my heart you've raised--
      And yet, how sweet it seems!
    My hopes, My dear, this much I know:
      You're mine, all mine, in dreams.

    O little maid, dear, dearest maid,
      Should you be lost to me
    Were I to wake and straightway go
      And tell my love to thee?
    What powers or aid could I invoke?
      Alas! dear one, it seems
    The risk's too great of losing all--
      So mine still stay in dreams.

[Illustration]




Should Dreams Come True

_The Jumbler wakes up and credits himself with a big heart._


    This man, O girl with charms untold,
      Has dreamed of Love and You;
    And can it be somewhere's a land
      Where these dreams may come true?
    Ah, if there be, then willingly
      To rainbow's end he'll go,
    Or far's the place where seas begin--
      For, Girl, he loves you so!

    And he, dear one, a king can be--
      Yes, by one way alone:
    That you, his Queen, through love for him,
      Should raise him to your throne.
    But whether he be king or serf,
      Of this be sure: thou art
    A mighty queen, whose realm is wide--
      You reign o'er all his heart.




Lotus Eating


    In the land of In-a-minute, the land of Lots-of-time,
    The land of What's-the-hurry? Manna-land sublime;
    The land of Sleep-a-whole-lot,--to me it ofttimes seems
    I sure should like to live there, for I'd have time for DREAMS.

(_Here the Jumbler becomes personal_):

    Now I'd not waste a minute if I lived in that clime,
    But say good-bye to worry, and dream--well all the time.
    And what, dear, do you reckon my fancy'd bring to view?
    The answer is so easy: Sweetheart, I'd dream of YOU.




Fergit Dem Dreams

_Leaving the Realm of Dreams, the Jumbler quotes the advice of a married
friend._


    Aw, cut it, kid! Dis lovin' gag
      Don't make no hit wid me;
    I've went de route and ought ter know--
      Fer, ain't I married? Gee!
    Dere's nuthin to it, foolish man;
      None of 'em's what dey seems,
    De game's a bunk, Kid, all way tru--
      Wake up, fergit dem dreams!




     _Most earnestly the Jumbler presents his views on Serious
     Matters pertaining to Love and Life._

    FICKLENESS OF MAIDENS.
    CONSTANCY--AS APPLIED TO ONE MAN.
    THE ONE AND THE ONLY.
    HANDLE WITH CARE.
    MY GARDEN.
    MY THRENODY.
    ETERNITY.




Fickleness of Maidens


    "Good-bye," I said to Mary,
      To Margie, Maud and May;
    And I put them from me harshly
      And turned myself away.
    For my _all in all_ was Maizie--
      I swore it on that day.

    But time came when my spirit
      Grew weary of its pace,
    And I cried, "Come back, dear ex-ones,
      I'm sick of just one face!"
    But they replied, "We cannot,
      Another has your place."

    (_After Dunbar_)

[Illustration:]




Constancy--As Applied to One Man


    A man by Nature ne'er was meant
      To love one maid alone--
    E'en if by doing so he'd gain
      A seat upon a throne.
    Polygamous when 'comes to love--
      (Be diff'rent no man can)
    Monogony's monotony
      When 'plied to love of man!

    Yet here am I! ('gainst Nature's law)--
      _Mirabile dictu_--
    Loving one maid, and just ONE (_sic_),
      Exclusively and true!
    As other men, I liv'd and lov'd
      Until you came my way--
    Now all my love is yours, O Queen,
      Forever and a day!

[Illustration]

    Dear, dear dead loves, one last farewell!
      Your graves no more I'll tend;
    Your ghosts, whom I have welcomed oft,
      Their visits now must end.
    Sweet girls, whom I have lov'd--and lost--
      Loved? Yes, but for a day--
    I now have found my Queen of Hearts
      Whom I can love alway.

    I once thought that I lov'd you well--
      But O! the love I feel
    For my dear Queen is diff'rent quite--
      And it's the love that's real.
    My Queen now has each thought, each dream;
      No more I'll think of you--
    Love was, love's past for all save her--
      So, ex-loves all, adieu.




Handle With Care


The tangible always is frangible. (Proven long since, I take it). By
chance or by art you've taken hold of my heart-- But please, Little
Girl, don't break it!




The One and The Only


    Hundreds of maids in this world have been born
      With many a charm that allures, dear;
    Hundreds are radiant, fair as the morn--
      But never were eyes just like yours dear.

    Hundreds boast beauty of form and of face,
      Which always devotion assures, dear;
    Hundreds personification of grace,
      But none has a smile just like yours, dear.

[Illustration]

    Hundreds accomplished in letters and song,
      And hundreds attractive and clever;
    Daily I walk through this limitless throng,
      Yet find none compares with you--ever.

    If from these hundreds an artist should mould
      A composite maid, near perfection;
    Stand her beside you, to choose I be told--
      My dear, can't you guess my selection?

    Hundreds and millions of maids there may be,
      And yet, without you I'd be lonely.
    Pray be convinced, for I speak truthfully:
      Dear, you are the ONE AND THE ONLY.




My Garden


    I wander into my garden,
      My garden of loves that are dead,
    And stop at a withered rose bush
      That once grew a blossom of red.

    How passionately, true I loved it,
      Thought without it I could not abide--
    How bitter it is to remember
      In a night it had withered and died.

    The violet that grew on the hillside
      I loved with a love that was true;
    But 'twas snatched from me e'en as I held it--
      O, Violet, dear, how I loved you!

    And dearest of all, the sweet June Rose,
      As a bud she'd come out first that year;
    But I lost her just as I'd plucked her--
      The heartless and pitiless dear!

    The lily and pink that I worshipped
      Each deigned but a season to stay,
    And returned not again though I waited
      And longed for them many a day.

    Dear loves that are dead, hear me say it:
      A loving good-bye to you all!
    No more shall I visit this garden,
      For my true love grows just o'er the wall.

    Having loved you has made my love stronger
      For her whom I now so adore;
    I'd truly not know how to love her
      Had I not loved you-all before.

    Good-bye, then, again, fairest garden;
      Good-bye to you all, fickle dears;
    Dear Rosemary, last, fondest treasure,
      Will be faithful to me through the years.




My Threnody


    The Weatherman's in direst straits;
      All wrong are his predictions;
    Not Bright and Fair, but Drear and Cold--
      And so his maledictions.

[Illustration]

    Now I can give the answer to
      This scientific gent:
    'Tis not from meteoric change--
      But just 'cause SHE has went.

    I've read by hundreds love-stuff books,
      But ne'er believed one bit
    When sun was made to cease to shine
      When "SHE" made her exit.

    But now I know that they were right;
      From Sol no rays are sent;
    It's dull and gray and dismal quite--
      And all 'cause SHE has went.

    I cannot read, nor write, nor think
      Since SHE has went, Oh, dear!
    Of compensation, though, there's heaps:
      For, well, she once was here!

    So I'll not mind the fierce heart pain
      That naught seems to allay.
    She's went, ah me! but I shall hope
      That she'll come back some day.




Eternity


    She's coming--
    The woman I loved and lost!
    Widowed at last and once more free.
    One hand, two, or arms? Ah, me!
    Our meeting, her greeting--....
    O what will it be?

    She's coming--
    The woman I loved--and love!
    Long have I waited so hopelessly;
    One year, all--yet faithfully.
    Returning! I'm yearning....
    Be kind, gods, to me!

    Yes, coming!
    O woman beloved of all,
    Come to arms that still ache so for thee!
    One age, two, ETERNITY
    For loving, for LOVING
    Awaits you and me.

(_Rendered by the Jumbler during the Intermission_).




I 'Ear Noes

_The Jumbler turns some anatomical terms._



    The night has a thousand eyes,
      The day to one lays claim;
    The big brown pair that you, dear, wear
      Sure puts them all to shame.

    It seems 'bout a thousand years
      My heart you've trod in dust;
    But lend an ear and listen, dear:
      The end of waste is bust.

    Though I've heard a thousand noes--
      As someone knows is true--
    An aye once said, we'll soon be wed,
      Or I'll be ever blue.




Ode to a Sylphine Figure


    Thinner yet and thinner--
    I would be like thee.
    I am nearly drowned in
    Perspiration's sea.
    From my adiposeness
    I'd be set clear free--
    Though it means my joining
    Broomstick cavalry.




Feelin' Blue


      My nose is red,
      I'm feeling blue!
      If you had bawled
      I guess so'd you ... be feelin' blue.
    BECAUSE I Have Just Run Into a Nest of Crying Women.

    I went to a Niobe party,
      Where all were expected to bawl;
    There were peachy repiners and whiners in minors--
      Your "Uncle" wailed loudest of all.

A Bare Story


    Nobody loves a man that's bald,
      I've often heard it said;
    But why does Love, then, laugh at locks?--
      It makes me scratch my head.




A Truth


    A simple truth I give to you
      To always recollect;
    There is one thing--and that's Friendship--
      Will not thrive on neglect.




Hooverize


    An order of Hoover's
      I think is quite good;
    "Don't feed your dear husband--
      But husband your food."




Fine


    "It must be fine," the Sweet Thing cried,
    "To write a poem like his'n."
    "It should be fine," the man replied,
    "Plus thirty days in prison."




Fugax, Sequax; Sequax, Fugax


    Maids, they say, like shadows are:
      (I wonder if it's true).
    Follow, and they run away;
      Retreat, they follow you!




A Betrayal of Irish Ancestry


    If you ask my wish sincerest,
      I will quickly make reply:
    May you live--yes, live _forever_--
      And be happy till you die.




Exit Cooky


    Our queasy queen of the cuisine
    A queer, querulous creature has long been;
    In her quite quiet way she quickly quit on Sunday--
    Quid est? Quid nunc? Why--quondam!




The Limit


    Prissy, persnickety people there be,
    Fastidious, finical ones, we see;
    But the fussiest man in town by far,
    Is he who washes his little Ford car.




Safety First


    PROPINQUITY plus
    PROXIMITY, plus
    A little ENCOURAGEMENT, dear,
    And havoc you'd play
    With my heart. I'm away
    To the umbrageous dingles, through fear.




Unbearable


    Three things my nature cannot stand--
      I'll name them, if you please:
    TEMPTATION and ENCOURAGEMENT;
      NEGLECT's the worst of these.




Wrong Prescription


    Tell me, please, sir, Mr. Captain--
      It's advice I'm lookin' fer--
    Is it true carbolic acid
      Is good for cooties, sir?

    Are you serious, poor rookie,
      Or are you making fun?
    What you mention isn't _good_ at all--
      It _kills_ 'em every one.




Seeing Double


    "Look twice before you leap, son,"
      My mother oft told me.
    Each time I take a second look,
      A second girl I see.

    The only thing that's better--
      You'll think me quite a dunce--
    Would be to have diplopia,
      Then I'd see two at once.




Wisdom


    Napoleon was a wise old guy;
      A saying of his ran
    Like this: "To all who would be safe,
      Don't write, just send a man!"




Just Talk

_Following the Intermission the Jumbler unravels the difference between
speech and talk and think and thought._


    From time an infant draws first breath
      And 'gins its virgin squaking,
    Each mother proud, not saving one,
      Translates all goos as talking.

    This goo means this, a girr means that--
      A new word every minute--
    It yells! Says pa, "My dear, you're right,
      There's surely something in it." (A pin, perhaps).

    Milk-Latin talk lasts 'bout a year,
      And then, strict truth I'm telling,
    A plain "Mam-ma" may strike your ear--
      In interim of yelling.

    The next few years great strides are made;
      Mamma is fair ecstatic,
    For now it talks as good as dad--
      'Cept 'course, it's not grammatic.

    And then comes slang, and cussing, too--
      If it's a boy, the latter--
    But if a girl, the whole day through
      It's giggle, chatter, chatter.

    And now it's grown, and still it talks!
      But will somebody answer:
    How much is said that tends to help
      Despondent fellow-man, sir?

    And words of comfort, love and cheer
      Are all not slow in giving?
    Yet it's the joy we scatter here
      That makes our lives worth living.

    From birth till death it's talk, talk, talk!
      But listen, please, and ponder:
    What would it mean if speech meant thought?
      Who would be dumb, I wonder?

The Man Who Made Umph-ta-ta Smile

_If to Heaven you would go--Smile._


    A god once was made and heathen had prayed
      To him throughout many a year;
    His face was distort with a frown of the sort
      That gave them all quakings of fear.
    The rulers in line, of whom there'd been nine,
      Each published this royal decree:
    _The man who'll beguile our fierce god to smile
      May claim the King's crown as his fee_.

    From all the world o'er had come by the score
      The jester, the fool and the clown;
    With quip and with jest had each tried his best,
      Yet not one displaced the god's frown.
    Joe Miller and Twain had been quoted in vain,
      (Each man as he failed was exiled.)
    But failures all scored, the god still looked bored,
      Then I appeared--and he smiled!

    When his visage had cleared, the heathen all cheered
      And each wore a smile good to see;
    With shouting and song they bore me along
      Till straight to the King they'd brought me.
    The King then stepped down, said
      "Sir, here's my crown,
      And gold you shall have by the pile,
    But tell me, I pray, just what did you say
      That made our god, Umph-ta-ta, smile?"

    "Your crown and your pelf, Sire, keep for yourself,"
      I said, "but pray listen to me:
    I just made the trial--_a smile for a smile_--
      And succeeded, Good King, as you see.
    Of pomp, Noble Sire, and of power I should tire,
      And soon think them not worth my while,
    Contented I'll be if 't can be said of me:
      'He's the man who makes everyone smile'.

    "Pray heed me, O King, a smile, Sire is the thing
      That will win you a smile in return;
    Just try it and see, and I'm sure you'll agree
      'Tis a thing that all people should learn.
    Your wise pulpiteers may belabor your ears
      With all the orthodox doctrines extant,
    But if t' Heaven you'd go, then you might as well know
      'Nless you smile throughout life--well, you _can't_!
    _There's nothing worth while can't be won with a smile_--
      A maxim you prove when you try--
    I must now be gone to pass the word on;
      There're others who need it. Good-bye!"

       *       *       *       *       *

    My story you've heard--well, then, just one word:--
      Is anyone now within sight?
    Just smile on him, do--why, _he's smiling at you_!
      Your very first test proves I'm right.




Myself and Me

_Unlike George Cohan, the Jumbler doesn't love himself._


    'Tis torrid here and all have gone
      To seashore on a trot;
    I'm left alone, alas! and I'm
      The only friend I've got.

    I've walked with me and talked with me
      Until I'm satiate;
    I'm sick and tired and bored with me;
      The thought of me I hate.

    Divorce I'd have 'tween self and me;
      For happiness I'd strike;
    We're surely incompatible
      'Cause too darned much alike.

C'est la Guerre

_After throwing his friends into fits, the Jumbler decides his
Soldier-French won't go._


    There are some folks, alas! I know
    Who Fletcherize the calico
      And pull out wads of hair
    When now and then, as if by chance,
    I lapse into the speech of France.
      But--blame it on _la guerre_.

    My accent's not Parisian, yet
    It's _tres bien_, so said Lizette--
      And surely she should know.
    She never frowned and said _non, non!_
    But she would smile and say, "_Bon bon!_"
      _Oui, oui_, I get you, Bo!

    _Jolie_ Jeanne plays the Marseillaise!
    I ball myself in many ways
      When this I try to say.
    But _tres_, _merci_, _chere_, and _beaucoup_
    I say just like the Frenchies do--
      Admit it, _s'il vous plait_.

    Yet if each time I _parlez vous_
    These friends must throw a fit or two
      And shock their systems so,
    I think I'll stick to plain _Anglais_
    And say _adieu_ to all _Francais_--
      My Soldier-French won't go!





Spring Styles


    "Well, you may talk
      Of woman's wiles
    Of all these lat-
      Est skinny styles;
    Rave over girls
      Built like a slat;
    But I must say
      I like 'em fat!"

    A girl that's fat?
      Oh, no, no, No!
    No lap, no waist
      Nor high nor low;
    An oozing mass
      When weather's hot--
    You like this type?
      Well, I do not!

    For me, a girl
      That's sylph-like made,
    Who's just the same
      In sun or shade;
    And as for me,
      And I'm no churl,
    Where there's no waist--
      Then there's no girl!

    No hefty bunch
      Of av'rdupois,
    No dray-horse girl
      Shall share my joys;
    But pocket-size,
      A featherweight,
    Will find me most
      Affectionate.

Strictly Proper


    Ol' Miss Propri'ty up an' say:
      "Why will you chilluns ack this way?
    Whenever I go out to walk
      I see you two--an' people talk!

    "Miss Grundy says to me today:
      'They go to ride, an' _stay_ an' _stay_.
    How come her pa don't take a hand
      An' call 'em down to beat the band?'

    "I've tol' you time an' time again
      A man should call but _now and then_,
    Unless the priest has called the banns
      An' date's been set for jinin' han's.

    "'Tain't proper, no, an' it ain't right
      To call or ride mos' ev'ry night.
    Hear now the last word that I'll say:
      _You break my rules--then you must pay!_"

    Ol' Miss Propri'ty, who are you
      That you should tell us what to do?
    Your mammy was a prissy scold,
      Yer dad a crabbed "sis," I'm told.

    You stick to rules your grandma 'ranged,
      Despite the fac' that times have changed.
    Propriety, Convention--these
      Are how determined, if you please?

    Ol' Miss, if true I love this maid
      Should I go slow and be afraid
    Of what the neighbor-folk will say?
      Nay, nay, a girl's not won that way!

    There're nine and ninety swains, they say,
      Who'd steal this maid. If I make hay
    I needs must work despite the fogs,
      And though it's raining cats and dogs.

    Ol' Miss, if you could see her eyes
      With laughter lit, or in surprise,
    Or questioning, or looking grave,
      Or beckoning--just hear me rave--

    Could see the beauty of her face,
      Her winsome ways, her lissom grace--
    Ah, Miss, your rules you'd cast aside
      And daily beg, "Dear, please come ride."

    Then why not I? I'm human, too.
      It's right for me if right for you.
    You see I've got so much to say
      I've _gotta_ see her ev'ry day.

    Ol' Miss she say, "My boy, you're right;
      I now see things in diff'rent light.
    My laws still rule the other guy,
      But to your case they don't apply.

    So tell her _my_ permission's got
      To call on her a nawful lot.
    You've found me easy, have you lad?
      All right, then try convincing DAD."




     _In a versatile manner the Jumbler approaches sundry themes,
     wherein is revealed his love for Home, Country and Eats._

    18 TO 45.
    YOU NEVER CAN TELL.
    AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION.
    FEAR NOT.
    EAT WHAT'S SET BEFORE YOU.
    SHOW ME.
    DAMFINO JONES.
    SILENT BILL.
    BUSTER BOY.
    NOT FORGETTING DAD.




18 to 45

_The Jumbler found the niche in which he fit--for just one day._


    I'm something over eighteen, yet
      I'm under forty-five!
        I've no flat feet, no leaky valves,
          No wife and babes alive.
            So--
          With no dependent, no defect,
        Not e'en a near-sight eye,
      Methinks quite soon I'll hear you say:
    "So long! Good luck! Good-bye!"

    My putteed calves will look a sight--
      I'm long, but short on weight--
        My feet won't fit the Munson last,
          My rising hour is eight.
            But--
          The army is gwine ter git me,
        My name's done been enrolled.
      I'd like to be a baby gal
    Not more'n one year old!

    I'm old enough, I'm young enough
      To do some thing, I guess;
        So I'll just stop my foolish talk
          And say, "I'm ready, yes!"
            For
         There's not a job, there's not a niche
        But needs some man to fit.
      For you and me there's just one thing:
    GO IN AND DO OUR BIT!

    They found a job, they found the niche
      They said that I would fit;
        And in Argonne one foggy morn
          They said, "Now do your bit!"
            Wow!
          Old Jerry seemed to know I'd come;
        His shells all came my way!
      Ugh! Mustard gas! * * * Then mustered out--
    I didn't last one day!

You Never Can Tell


    Harry had two Munson feet
      That grew like ice and snow
    At bare suggestion of the thought
      That he to War should go.

    But when the Draft got him one day
      His face grew stern and grim;
    And ere he'd been in camp a month
      They'd made a _man_ of him.

    'Twas "Captain Harry" soon in France.
      Midst fighting over there
    He got two wounds, a D. S. C.,
      Also the Croix de Guerre.

    The moral in this simple tale
      You've guessed, I have no doubt:
    _You cannot tell whats in a man
      Until he's tested out._




An Ounce of Prevention


    When first the Flu our old town hit
      I said I'd keep from getting;
    So I went home and with great care
      I shut out drafts and shut out air.
    I sprinkled sulphur in my shoes,
      Then loaded up on blockade booze,
    Some calomel and "C.C." pills,
      Then castor oil up to my gills.
    Each hour on soda I did feast;
      I swallowed cakes of Fleischmann's yeast;
    I ate ten onions, mighty nigh,
      Then drank a slug of Good Old Rye;
    Some asafoet'da round my neck,
      Then took quinine, about a peck.
    To keep from feeling all forlorn
      I fraternized with Barleycorn;
    Then aspirin, say twenty grains,
      And codeine to keep off pains.
    I chewed tobacco, smoked it, too,
      Then took a dip of Mountain Dew.
    I crawled in bed to get a rest,
      Vick's Vaporub smeared on my chest.
    I changed to woolen underduds
      And carried 'round two Irish spuds;
    I sprayed and gargled, wore a mask,
      Snuffed Listerine, then tried my flask.
    I felt my pulse; at tongue a look,
      And then my temper'ture I took.
    But strange to say quite sick I grew--
      _The doctor says I've got the Flu!_
    I guess he's right, but this is sure:
      Right now I need the likker cure.

           *       *       *       *       *

    I wonder if I'd stayed up town,
      Cut out the dope, kept worry down,
    Stayed right at work, not had a drink--
      Would I have Flu? What do you think?




[Illustration]




Fear Not


    Why will so many people now
      Give way to frenzied fear?
    Why will they act as though they thought
      Swift Death were lurking near?

    E'en if Disease now stalks abroad
      And Death rides on the air,
    'Tis not the time for craven acts,
      But courage everywhere.

    I wonder if they stop to think
      How soon the war'd be won
    If sons of theirs showed half the fear
      That they of late have done?

    And why fear death--eternal life?
      I would not be the one
    To strive to stay on this poor earth
      With sacred tasks undone.

    So, why not chirk up just a bit
      And say good-bye to fear?
    The world now needs much cheering up--
      Pray help supply the cheer.




Eat What's Set Before You


    As children ofttimes we were wont
      To criticise and fuss
    About the victuals that were cooked
      And served by ma to us:
    "Too salty" this, and "too sweet" that;
      "You've had this twice since Sunday;
    You always have what others like,
      You might please me just one day."
    And so it went till pa would say:--
      'Twas meant you could not doubt it--
    "Just eat what's set before you and
      Say nothin' 'tall about it."

    Now we are grown and, seems to me,
      Too often we're inclined
    To criticise the things Fate gives,
      And think this life a grind.
    Some things may not just suit our taste,
      Some e'en be quite unpleasant;
    Someone may get the bigger share
      And failure seem e'er present;
    But then, let's think of pa's advice:--
      It's sound, pray never doubt it--
    "Just eat what's set before you and
      Say nothin' 'tall about it."

    Life's road is rough--but what of that?
      The man who'll growls forswear
    Will top the hills ahead the crowd
      All smiles, with breath to spare.
    And so it goes this wide world o'er--
      'Tis true for saint and sinner--
    The man who silently will "dig"
      Will always prove the winner.
    That's why I say take pa's advice:--
      Try once and you'll not doubt it--
    "Just eat what's set before you and
      Say nothin' 'tall about it."

Show Me


    There is a dame I know you know,
      Who'll make big talk, will brag and blow
        About the waffles that she makes,
          Also her corn and buckwheat cakes--
            But always my cake's dough.

    She tells of this or that one who
      At breakfast, once ate twenty-two!
        And when she feared that he would bust
          He raved and railed and almost cussed,
            And said he wa'n't half through.

    I've hinted and I've begged this dame
      To just for once treat me the same.
        But always she the question begs,
          Or's out of cream, or maybe eggs,
            Or some excuse as lame.

    Yet here am I, so thin and pale,
      While she, dear soul, is plump and hale.
        If she's the best cook in the South,
          Why let me stand with watering mouth?--
            She should be sent to jail!

    Now, I'm from out Missouri way,
      Where "Please show me," is what they say.
        I'm hungry and too weak to walk,
          So "Please feed me, or stop your talk!"
            I'll tell her this today.

    A pawfull and a mawfull I
      Must have or else I fear I'll die.
        Her talk does naught but aggravate;
          It does not help my famished state
            Nor hunger satisfy.

    Unless I get a waffle quick,
      Unless I get it awful quick,
        I'd better beat her up, I guess,
          And mar her beauty more or less--
            Unless I get it quick!

Damfino Jones


    Damfino Jones, a mental drone,
    Had no opinion of his own;
    He grew to manhood meek and mild,
    But he was Indecision's child,
    It was the same in weal or woe:
    He "wasn't sure," or "didn't know."
    In business he would hesitate
    To buy or sell until too late;
    So, naturally he ran in debt--
    But hasn't run back out as yet.
    When asked when he a debt would pay
    He "couldn't just exactly say."
    In romance he just "couldn't just exactly say."
    If he loved Blanche or Isabel--
    He married Jane, and, safe to say,
    'Twas she who kept the wolf at bay.
    And with religion, mixed he got
    When asked if orthodox or not.
    In politics he'd weigh and weigh,
    And then not vote on 'lection day.
    And so he wavered till he died
    And never did one thing decide.
    Now I don't know, but it is said
    He isn't now quite sure he's dead.
    Take note of men who've made success:
    They tell you "No" or tell you "Yes"
    Right off the bat, nor step aside
    When faced with questions to decide;
    While men like Jones just paw the air
    And never do get anywhere.
    This truth shines out like bright new tin:
    _Think for yourself if you would win_.




Silent Bill


    I have a friend called "Silent Bill,"
      Aged ten, so says the Bible;
    To me, in years, no word he's said--
      Strange truth and not base libel.
    He seems quite bright, and sees and hears--
      In fact you'd think him normal;
    But not a sound comes from his lips,
      Not e'en to greeting formal.

    When he's at home, so I am told,
      It's talk, talk, talk, and chatter;
    When I'm around, why is he dumb?
      Explain, what is the matter?
    Am I an ogre fierce and wild
      With looks and mien ferocious
    That cause to cling unto its roof
      The tongue of this precocious?

    "Oh, no!" says he, "you're not to blame."
      (The answer comes by proxy.)
    "The fault's not yours, but all guilt lies
      With my dear mother, foxy.
    I'd like to talk of lots of things--
      But ain't my ma the limit?
    She starts her tongue--so what's the use?
      I'm out, 'less I butt-in it."

    "It's 'seen not heard,' so I've been told,
      Or else a strapping vi'lent.
    I fear the gad, and that's why I
      Remain still Bill-the-silent.
    Now, when you scrap about her size
      I'm mum, but try to figger
    How she could squeeze in through the door
      If she were any bigger."

    "But when she twits you 'bout the thatch
      You've lost from off your attic,
    I'd like to reprimand her then
      In language quite emphatic.
    I've waited long and ground my teeth,
      And frowned upon her patter;
    But I'm convinced she'll ne'er run down--
      She's stuffed with ceaseless chatter."

           *       *       *       *       *

    Dear Silent Bill, stay silent still;
      To change, pray do not bother;
    You're dearer far just as you are;
      I'd true not have you other.




Buster Boy

_The Jumbler, like Foss, loses a boy._


    I have a friend called "Buster"--
      A little child last Fall--
    But now he's grown so very big
      I scarce know him at all.
    Almost a man! His folks are proud
      And fairly beam with joy;
    But I--I feel I'd rather cry;
      For I--I've lost my _boy_.

    No more he'll perch upon my knee
      And ask me to relate
    How Li Chi Fair and Chang-the-Good
      Were saved from saddest fate.
    And Jelly Jar and Big Black Bear
      He'll treat with sneering scorn
    And say, "Now please do stop and think
      How long since I was born."

    Time flies so fast it takes my breath!
      Soon he'll forget it all--
    The rhymes we wrote, the games we played,
      None, none will he recall.
    The world may praise him as a MAN--
      God knows I wish him joy--
    But I--I'll brush away a tear
      And long for Buster _Boy_.




Not Forgetting Dad


    A new kid's come to our house;
      A peach, I'm here to tell;
    And things are topsy-turvy like--
      Still--_Father's doing well_!

    'Twas 3 A. M. this morning
      That it began to squall;
    Some neighbors got excited--
      But Dad wa'n't feased at all.

[Illustration]

    Twas--oh, yes, quite expected--
      And welcome, I opine;
    And bibs and socks and--things are made,
      And--_Daddy's feeling fine_!

    Another Christmas present!
      Gee, that's hard luck for fair!
    The Old Man says, "Mere bagatelle,
      Why should a fawther care?"

    How's Mother? Oh, she's so-so!
      The Kid? Well, it will do.
    Of Papa we are glad to state
      That he will sure pull through.

    Then, here's a cheer for Mother;
      One for the Kid we give;
    Now ready--give a score of them:
      _Doc says that Pa will live_!




Chromatic


    We've got a nice red moo-cow-moo,
      But doesn't seem just right.
    She eats green grass the whole day through
      Then gives us milk that's white.

    "Red cows, when on blue-grass are fed,
      Give white milk." Is this true?
    I am so green, when this I read
      It straightway made me blue.


A FLARE BACK:

    We also, have a moo-cow-moo.
      She isn't red, but black;
    The milk she gives, it isn't white,
      But blue,--alas, alack!
    Methinks that _you'd_ be black and blue
      Had you your due, young fellow;
    But matters not the shade or hue,
      Just so you're never yellow!




Enuf!


    When "dis ol' waggin am done broke down,"
      I feel 'twould be a sin
    To hold your love through Pity's sake
      For what I once had been.

    "Yours till death!" is what they say;
      But isn't it enough
    To say, "Dear Girl, I sure am yours
      Until the wheels fall off?"




     _And here the Jumbler entertains the children with a few
     Nursery rhymes:_


    THE EVENING BATH (Apartment Next Door).
    THE DIRTY-NECK POLICEMAN AND THE BLACK-HAND.
    DO YOU BELIEVE IN SANTA CLAUS?
    SHAVING TIME.
    THE BIG BLACK BEAR.




The Evening Bath

(_Apartment Next Door_).



    I try to read--but really, what's the use?
    You'd think, I swear, 'twas Bedlam broken loose;
    A scream! And then I hear, "Oh mercy! Ouch! My ear!
    I surely cannot stand all this abuse!
    You're gouging me and pulling out my hair;
    My skin's rubbed off--'tis more than I can bear!
    Now really you're not heeding or you'd see my nose is bleeding!
    I believe you would kill me if you dared!"

    I jump up from my chair and grab my gun;
    I must be quick or murder will be done;
    I rush across the hall and loudly 'gin to call:
    "Unnatural parent, wouldst thou slay thy son?",
    Upon the door I then begin to beat,
    And straightway hear the scamper of bare feet;
    Then "Mother" stood and laughed, said, "Surely you've gone daft--
    I'm only giving them their evening bath."

    She calmed herself and then she sweetly said,
    "I always scrub 'em 'fore they go to bed;
    But don't see why my daughter should have such fear of water;
    And Buster,--why, it simply drives him mad!
    I really don't see what I'm going to do,
    Despite the fact it greatly worries you;
    Of course it may seem mean but I'm going to keep them clean--
    And I don't know how unless I scrub 'em down."

           *       *       *       *       *

    So "Cleanliness is next to Godliness!"
    It may be so; but really I confess
    I'd let them go as black as night and look just like an awful fright--
    Unless the Gold Dust Twins'd do the work.
    What matter, pray, if streaks run 'round the neck
    And dirt be under nails, about a peck?
    I'd rather, oh, yes, quite, that they were black than white--
    If I disturbed the town when bathing them.

[Illustration]




The Dirty-Neck Policeman and the Black Hand


    Oh, run! Oh, mercy, run! you little children,
      Just as fast and quickly as you can!
    For here comes the Dirty-Neck Policeman,
      And I'm sure I see the Black-Hand man.

    So, scrub, scrub, scrub your little hannies,
      And your necks, pray don't forget them, dears;
    These men will surely get you if you're dirty;
      They'll pay no attention to your tears.

    The Dirty-neck Policeman he jes' grabs you,
      And if he finds your neck's not clean and white,
    He carries you away in spite of begging,
      And keeps you from your mother all that night!

    Next day his ugly wife gets soap and water,
      And scrubs you with a great big curry-comb;
    And if you cry she fills your mouth with soap-suds,
      Till you promise you will keep clean when you get home.

[Illustration]

    The Black-hand Man keeps hidin' 'round the corner,
      A-lookin' at your knuckles and your nails;
    And if they're dirty he jes' rushes at you
      And grabs you with a hook--he never fails!

    And then he sits down on you when he's caught you,
      Sandpapers you until you're bleedin', My!
    And he jes' laughs and chuckles while he's working,
      And rubs you all the harder if you cry!

    So it's best to keep quite clean, or you'll be sorry;
      You never know just when you may get caught;
    The Dirty-neck Policeman's mighty watchful,
      And the Black-hand Man's a-hidin' 'round a lot!




Do You Believe in Santa Claus?


    "Aw, youse kids make me orful tired,
      Talkin' 'bout Sandy Claws!
    Huh! Don'tcher know he's jest a fake,
      And nothin' 'cept our pas?

    "When your ma tells you all this rot,
      Don't believe her no more;
    Get wise! I've watched and seen pa work--
      Dere bluffin' makes me sore."

    "O Jim! You shouldn't say such things!"
      The rest intreated him,
    "For if you do you'll make him mad,
      And he'll forget you, Jim."

    "Of course Old Santa's sure-nuff true,
      An' comes 'round every year
    An' brings you things, if you are good--
      We think him just a dear.

    "The fairies, you'll be saying next,
      Are make-believes also.
    Just 'cause you're tough (our mas say so)
      Is no sign that you know."

    Well, Christmas morning came, and Jim
      His stockings rushed to see.
    He took one look and then he cried,
      "They're empty as can be!"

    But then he found, by hunting 'round,
      A suit of underwear,
    A tooth-brush and a handkerchief
      Upon a kitchen chair.

    He cried and cried and then ran out--
      Was anxious so to see
    If others in the neighborhood
      Had fared the same as he.

    But Mary had a baby doll,
      And Jamie had a sled;
    Virginia had some roller skates,
      An air-gun had small Fred.

    Besides, much candy they all had,
      And lots and lots of toys
    And things that Santa always brings
      To real good girls and boys.

    "Now fellers, w'at's the answer, say?
      I'm mad enough to swear!
    I _needed_ skates--why did I _get_
      A suit of underwear?

    "It seems that you-uns ev'ry one
      Has got most everything
    That you have said for weeks you hoped
      That Sandy Claws would bring."

       *       *       *       *       *

    The answer is, dear children:
      Old Santa Claus don't doubt.
    For if you do--the truth I tell--
      Like Jim, you'll be left out!




Shaving Time


    When Dad gets out his safety
      The family 'gin to quake;
    They huddle 'round the doorway,
      Nor dare the silence break.

    When Dad gets out his safety,
      A hush falls on the air
    And Fido runs to hide him
      Beneath a friendly chair.

    Then Ma, she tiptoes gently
      To fetch him water hot,
    And lest he want for towels
      She lays him out a lot.

    One of us goes for talcum,
      And one for shaving soap;
    Another gets witch hazel,
      Cold cream and smelly dope.

    Then we withdraw us quickly
      And watch him from afar;
    A safety's mighty dang'rous--
      It wouldn't do to jar.

    With face all white and soapy
      He scrapes his cheeks and chin;
    The way he frowns and winces
      It surely hurts like sin.

    But when the job is over
      And Dad looks clean and young,
    We all resume our breathing,
      And songs of praise are sung.

    As Dad cleans up his safety
      You ought to see him strut
    And brag about how easy 'tis
      His face to never cut.

    When Dad's put 'way his safety
      He laughs with fiendish glee
    To think the grasping barber
      From him will get no fee.

    But ev'ry silver lining
      Has dark clouds lurking near:
    Tomorrow morn Dad's safety
      Brings back our hour of fear.





The Big Black Bear


    Come, bear with me, I'll tell to you
    Of Big Black Bears with children two;
    Of Father Bear, too ready to dare,
    And Mother, and the cross she bare.
    'Twas "Cinnabar" and "Blackberry" that Pa Bear his children named;
    But simply "Bairns" was nicer far, the mother stoutly claimed.
    A lively time these children had, of pleasures had no lack;
    The thing that tickled them the most was bareback pick-a-pack.
    This man Bear was, oh! so wicked and sly,
    He'd steal and then tell you a barefaced lie;
    The older he grew the more he would fight--
    Stuck on himself 'cause he could read and write.

    This Big Black Bear was a grouchy bear,
    And a cross old bear was he;
    He snapped and clawed and bristled and pawed
    And growled ferociously!
    This Big Black Bear broke open the door
    And walked right into the groc'ry store;
    He ate all the sugar, he ate all the ham,
    And left not a cent for the groc'ryman.
    He wrapped up honey and choice candies
    And he then left a note: "Just charge 'em, please;
    I'm gaunt and sore, I've come a distance,
    And take enough for bare existence."

    The grocer, next morn, collected some men
    And tracked the foot-prints right up to the den;
    The Cubs, when they came, were out all alone,
    But raced through cubbyholes cut in the stone.
    The Bears laid low, kept out of sight,
    Cubs snuggled down like it was night.
    "All right," said the men, "we'll sure get you yet!"
    And then went to work a big trap to set.
    They got it all fixed and placed on the ground,
    And then lots of honey scattered around;
    And then, lest some traveler its sight should miss,
    They nailed up a sign that looked just like this:

[Illustration: BEWARE FORBEAR]

    As soon as they had gone quite a while
    Old Pa Bear sneaked out, then called with a smile;
    "Come out, hustle up, there's nothing to fear;
    There's honey enough for all of us here!"
    "To me," says Ma, "this thing spells ruin;
    I feel that there is trouble brewin'!"
    "Tut, tut!" says Pa, "just like a fool!
    'Tis plain you never went to school.
    If you could read you'd plainly see
    That this was sent a gift to me.
    'Bee-ware' is honey, surely you know;
    And 'For-Bear' is what it says below.
    Now cubbies, you see how much you need
    To learn right soon to write and to read.
    So study real hard, become a power--
    A Cub reporter, some day, or maybe the bar."
    "Dip in," said he, "la, la it's swell!"
    And then let out an awful yell!!----
    For the trap had sprung and caught him fair----
    The fam'ly quickly ran to the lair.
    Then ping!! crack!! crack!! a loud report!!
    "All in!" cried they, "Oh, my, what sport!"
    They skinned him and carried away the dead;
    But not a pall-bearer once bared his head.
    On this Bear's sad end the grocer oft does gloat--
    What's now left of Pa is a big winter coat.
    When the weather's cold (not immodest nor sin)
    The Grocer comes forth just in his bear skin.
    The Cubs, thus bereft, were frightened quite,
    They sobbed and they cried with all of their might.
    "Come, Bairns," said Ma, "let's off to the wood;
    I'll get you a new pa who'll do as Bears should."
    She did it and made a most excellent wife,
    And all are now living the happiest life.





Missing You

_Impelled by lonesomeness, the Jumbler is inspired to this bit of
sentimental rhyme._


    Feeling mighty lonely;
      Yes, getting pow'ful blue;
    Dearie, here's the answer:
      I'm missing, missing you.

    Rain beats 'gainst the window,
      Or skies are bright and blue;
    Doesn't seem to matter--
      I'm missing, missing you.

    Days are long and tiresome,
      And nights seem endless, too;
    Slumber is a stranger--
      I'm missing, missing you.

    Writing rhyme is easy,
      'Bout all that I can do;
    Ev'ry word in English
      Now wants to rhyme with _You_.

    If I thought, my dearie,
      That you missed me, too,
    I should then be happy
      In missing, missing you.

    Joy lives close to Sadness,
      The steps are short and few:
    Changing just one letter
      Makes "_missing_" "_kissing_" you.

Varied hyphenation was retained except where noted below, for example,
"Black Hand" and "Black-Hand" which appears twice in each form. Obvious
punctuation errors repaired.

Page 38, "litsen" changed to "listen" (an ear and listen)

Page 70, line "None, none will he recall." was indented to match rest of
poem's layout.

Index, hyphen added to "Dirty-Neck" to match the text's usage (The
Dirty-Neck Policeman)

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
