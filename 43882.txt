"'Now I'm furnished,'" hummed the Baron. "'Now I'm furnished'--with
several books for my journey, and----" "Tickets, please," broke in the
inspector. "Just when I was comfortable," growled the Baron; "but no
matter. And now for the _Pen and Pencil Sketches_."

[Illustration: "Little Billee."]

The father of Mr. STACY MARKS predestined him for the coach-building
business. Providence, interposing, made him a painter, and the gaiety of
nations has been increased by the possession of some storks. In _Pen and
Pencil Sketches_ (CHATTO AND WINDUS) he has given the world some
reminiscences of a career justly crowned by the laurels of the Royal
Academy. The work is in two volumes, and my Baronite says would have
been more than twice as good had it been in one. The first volume is
charming, with its chat about LEIGH'S studio and the men met there; of
CHARLES KEENE and the delightful cruise off Gravesend in the _William
and Mary_; of merry days with the St. John's Wood clique; of nights at
ARTHUR LEWIS'S; and of days with FRED WALKER. When the flood of memory
runs dry, and there still remains a second volume to be produced, Mr.
MARKS grows desperate, and shovels in anything he finds handy in the
pigeon-holes of his desk. Thus the pleased reader finds reprinted
articles that appeared in the _Spectator_ thirty years ago, when Mr.
MARKS was art critic to that respectable journal. Also there is a
description of BAMPTON, which once thrilled the readers of the _Tiverton
Gazette_. This gives to the second volume something of the smell of an
apple store-room. But the first is good enough to atone for the burden
of the second. By a happy coincidence, whilst Mr. DU MAURIER in _Trilby_
has made all the world in love with _Little Billee_, he appears under
his own name in many of Mr. MARKS' pages, and is always the same
charming, simple-minded, sensitive man of genius. It is pleasant to read
how our Mr. AGNEW--"WILLIAM" the wise call him--gave the young painter
his first substantial lift. WALKER had painted a picture he called
"_Spring_," a young girl gathering primroses in a wood. Yielding to the
advice of his friends, he put on it a price the amount of which abashed
him. Mr. AGNEW saw the picture, recognised its merit, and wrote a cheque
for the full amount asked. When the young artist heard of his good
fortune he burst into tears, and gasping out "I must go and tell my
mother," rushed from the place. Of the original sketches with which the
volumes are enriched are some pen-and-ink drawings by FRED WALKER, which
reveal in a new light the painter of "_The Almshouse_." Amongst many
good stories, Mr. MARKS tells how he was addressed by a clergyman, who,
believing from his name that he was a Jew, invited him to look in at his
church and be converted. "MARCO'S" reply conclusively proved his
possession of a Christian spirit.

[Illustration: "A Late Physician."]

Since SAMUEL WARREN wrote his _Diary of a Late Physician_,--to which, as
the Baron supposes, allusion is made in p. 200 of this book, where the
narrator says, "Thus it happens that the ablest chronicler of their
(_i.e._ medical men's) experiences in our literature was a lawyer,"--no
more interesting, and occasionally sensational, stories have appeared
than those written by Mr. CONAN DOYLE, and published by METHUEN & CO. in
a single volume, under the title of _Round the Red Lamp_. One of these,
_A Straggler of '15_, has been recently developed into a one act
dramatic sketch for Mr. IRVING, who, in the part of the ancient veteran
"lagging superfluous," is reported to have achieved a remarkable
success. For pathos, _A Physiologist's Wife_ is as perfect in style as
it is original in design; to those who want to take something strong
before going to bed, the Baron can confidently recommend _The Case of
Lady Sannox_; while for those of the inferior sex whom Providence has
blessed with nerves, the Baron prescribes to be taken, the last thing at
night, with a favourite pipe and a tumbler of the reader's special
"wanity," the story of _Lot No. 249_; "lights full up," as the stage
directions say, the door locked, and the room previously searched, in
order to be quite sure that no practical joker is in hiding behind
screen, curtains, or under table, who might think it humorous to pop out
when you are deep in the story, and "give you fits."

In the _Yellow Book_, No. 3, let me praise Mr. DOWSON'S "Apple Blossoms
in Brittany"; a charming unfinished picture. You must guess what the
fruit may possibly be from the blossom. Also very good is HENRY
HARLAND'S "When I am a King."

AN ECCLESIASTICAL HIBERNIAN-IBERIAN MEDDLE AND MUDDLE.--Lord HALIFAX
writes to the Cardinal Archbishop of TOLEDO to protest against the
appointment of an Anglo-Iberian bishop to Spain made by the Archbishop
of DUBLIN & CO.; and his English Eminence Cardinal VAUGHAN writes to
Spanish Eminence to protest against the protest of Lord HALIFAX. Of
which the sum is that all the parties to the case are evidently, for the
time being, Protestants!

ORIGIN OF THE BLUSH-ROSE.

  I asked the Queen of Flowers
    Why the blush-rose blushed so red,
  Through the sun-rays and the showers,
    And so bowed its modest head.
  And fair Flora whispered "Hush!
    It would hurt the rose to hear!--
  The beginning of that blush
    Was not love, or shame, or fear.
  All the pretty faery fancies
    That you find in poet's song,
  And encounter in romances,
    Are entirely false and wrong.
  That flush so fair and fleeting
    Means not passion, pride or pity;
  But hot memories of the meeting
    Of a Vigilance Committee!"

A HOPELESS QUEST.

  My mind a perfect blank I've made,
    Upon a disc I've fixed my eyes.
  I hoped, by mesmerism's aid,
    To probe stupendous mysteries.
  Hour after hour in solitude
    I thus have spent, but, to be frank,
  There was no magic trance ensued,
    My mind remained a perfect blank.

  To _seances_ if I repair,
    "A hostile influence" they detect.
  The spirits, of my presence ware,
    Their customary rites neglect.
  A few faint raps, and they have flown,
    With all their perfumes, notes, and flowers.
  The mediums on my entrance frown--
    I am not blest with occult powers!

PERFECT.--The _Daily Telegraph_, in a short notice of a present made to
a Mr. OSLER for assisting the police, mentions the unavoidable absence
on this interesting occasion of "Chief Inspector BELTON,"--which is a
good name suggestive of staff attached to "belt on,"--and of "Mr.
Superintendent FERRETT"--than which no better name was ever found, out
of a burlesque novel, for a clever detective.

TWO WAYS OF AUDITING.

I.--THE OLD WAY.

SCENE.--_A Chamber in a Civic Building. The Town Clerk and the Auditor
discovered at a table covered with papers._

_Clerk._ Then I believe that you are entirely satisfied with the
accounts?

_Auditor._ Oh, perfectly. (_After a pause._) There is one item
I wanted to ask about--I've no doubt you'll be able to explain it
satisfactorily--it's this "L25 for ginger-beer to the Mayor and Council
on the occasion of opening the new Cemetery." Does not--er--that sum
represent a rather large number of bottles?

_Clerk_ (_in an off-hand way_). Well, we put down ginger-beer, you know,
as it _looks_ better, and there's a rather strong temperance party in
the borough. Of course, it was really champagne--"extra sec," too, you
bet!

_Auditor._ Oh, of course. I merely mentioned the matter for the sake of
form. And the "L15 for cigars"--that was an expenditure incurred at the
same time, I conclude?

_Clerk_ (_carelessly_). Oh, yes. Y'see, one of the Councillors is the
leading tobacconist in the place.

_Auditor_ (_relieved_). Ah, that accounts for it. Then these "models of
the Crematorium in gold and jewels, as brooches for the wives of the
Councillors"--I see they come to L105 in all.

_Clerk_ (_sternly_). You don't _object_ to the brooches, I presume?

_Auditor_ (_anxiously_). Oh, not at all. Not in the least. A
most--er--praiseworthy method of spending the ratepayers' money.

_Clerk._ Quite so. Our Mayor's our leading jeweller, you know. So, as
you've put "Examined and Approved," shall we go in to lunch? For a "cold
collation on the occasion of the audit" our Council always allows L10.
It'll be rather a good feed.

    [_Exeunt into banqueting apartment._

II.--THE NEW WAY.

_Auditor._ Oh, what larks!

    [_Subsides into a chair, and takes two minutes to recover from
    his fit of merriment._

_Clerk_ (_surprised_). I really fail to see where the joke comes in.

_Auditor._ Oh, don't you know? I'm one of the new class of comic
auditors--"made in Manchester." What tickles me is this item of L17 for
gold match-boxes for lighting the cigars of the Mayor and Aldermen on
the occasion of the visit to the Sewage Farm. _There's_ persiflage, if
you like!

_Clerk_ (_smiling_). I'm glad you take so humorous a view of the matter.
Of course you allow that expenditure?

_Auditor._ Allow it! Not for worlds. Then--(_with difficulty restraining
another outburst of mirth_)--how about "L27 for oysters and Chablis"
after the visit?

_Clerk._ The Council naturally required some refreshment at the end of
the journey--quite a quarter of a mile, in their own carriages--and
oysters were rather dear just then--a little out of season.

_Auditor_ (_after a guffaw_). Capital! "Out of season"--out of reason,
too, _I_ should say. Of course I must surcharge the oysters and Chablis.
Really, I'm enjoying myself immensely!

_Clerk_ (_gloomily_). I hope the Council will feel equal enjoyment at
your report. Do you mean seriously----

_Auditor._ Seriously! Not a bit of it. I tell you I'm a comic character.
And what better practical joke can one play than suddenly to come down
on public officials with an audit disallowing all their little personal
luxuries? Afraid I must strike out these items of "Visits to Olympia by
Corporation to inspect the lighting arrangements," and "Ditto at Empire
and Alhambra Theatres." No doubt the Aldermen will be glad to pay for
them themselves. Now I think the business is finished. Lunch? No,
thanks. A screaming joke like this is lunch enough for me.

    [_Crams handkerchief in mouth, and exit._

       *       *       *       *       *

CANT _v._ CANT.

  If "want of decency is want of sense,"
    So want of sense may very likely lead
  To want of decency. The poor pretence
    Of interested vice sense will not heed.
  A satyr's satire is but sorry stuff;
    Anti-Cant's canting is most sickening fudge.
  Belial, who backs his trade with bounce and bluff,
    Wins not a case where wisdom is the judge.
  Protests against the pryings of the prude
    Are not to help the profitably lewd.

THE POLITE GUIDE TO THE CIVIL SERVICE.

(_By an Affable Philosopher and Courteous Friend._)

HOW TO ENTER THE CIVIL SERVICE.

In the good old days of yore there was little trouble in obtaining
admission to the Civil Service. All that was necessary was a slight
knowledge of a Cabinet Minister, and a smattering of schooling. The
latter might be obtained at Eton, Winchester, Rugby, Westminster, or
Harrow. The acquaintance of the Minister, of course, had to be made by
your father. You were too young to have attracted the attention of so
important a personage. Suppose you had reached the mature age of
eighteen, and had given up the round jackets and collars of boyhood, and
had assumed "stick-ups" and "cutaways," your father would probably ask
you "What you intended to do next?"

"No, my dear fellow," would be the paternal reply to a suggestion about
Trinity or Christ Church. "I am afraid I can't manage either. You see,
your two elder brothers went to the University, but then we could find
_them_ family livings. It would be useless to let you read for the Bar,
because we haven't any of us married into a single firm of Solicitors;
and in these hard times I really can't afford to buy you a commission."

You would notice _sotto voce_ that when ways and means were being
discussed, times were always hard.

"I suppose you could be a doctor if you pleased; but walking the
hospitals is not a particularly pleasant occupation. Then there is
another opening--why not try the Civil Service?"

You would rather freshen up at this. You would have read in a comic
paper, that never will be nameless, that Government clerks were like the
fountains in Trafalgar Square (old style), "because they played from ten
to four."

"Well, yes," you would return. "I don't think I should mind that so
much. It would be rather fun to go to Paris as an _attache_."

"I'm afraid I couldn't quite manage that, my dear boy," your fond parent
would respond. "They don't pay _attaches_ at first, and so you would
have to be satisfied with the War Office or the Admiralty instead of the
Foreign Office."

"All right, Pater," you would say, and leave the matter in the hands of
the elder generation.

Then your father would write to any Cabinet Minister of his acquaintance
about things in general and nothing in particular, and would add a
"P.S." asking for a nomination. In due course a reply would come
granting the sweet boon. A test examination would follow of a
perfunctory character, and an intimation of your appointment would be
the sequel. Then you would take up your daily residence in Pall Mall or
Whitehall for twenty or thirty years and then retire as a Knight or a
C.B. Thus was done in the comparatively long ago. But now-a-days another
plan has to be adopted.

Instead of entering the Civil Service as a junior join it as a senior.
As a preliminary you must get into the House. This is simpler than
having to cram and then stand the racket of a competitive examination.
Any one under certain conditions can enter Parliament, but the Civil
Service Commissioners bar the entrance to the Government offices with
equally certain regulations. For the sake of argument let me assume that
you are in the House. You have stood for Slocum-on-the-Marsh, and have
persuaded the Slocum-on-the-Marshers to elect you. As an M.P. you are
duly qualified to accept any appointment under the Crown when the
Government ask you. The best plan is to think of an office and then add
one to it--yourself.

"Why not the Public Squander Department?" you ask yourself. To which you
reply with a second question, "Why not?"

Yes, the P. S. D. is not half bad. But how to get into it. Well, why not
take up Milestones? All the world knows that the Public Squander
Department are responsible for all the Milestones not under the
superintendence of the county authorities. Go for the Milestones.

Begin with a question. Learn that the Milestones in the Old Bath Road
are in many cases illegible. Request the Secretary of the Public
Squander Department to inform you when the inscription of such and such
a Milestone was last restored? The official will fence the query.
Probably his Private Secretary, considering you a new man, will have
failed to furnish the necessary information. You must expect a little
retardation at the first set-off.

And here let me point out for your future guidance the importance of
having a private secretary thoroughly up to his work. Had your answerer
been possessed of the proper sort of assistant you would have been
discovered, respectfully button-holed, and perforce satisfied. You would
never have had the heart to put your question about the Milestones. But
the particular Private Secretary of your answerer being _not_ up to his
work you get snubbed.

But don't be discouraged; stick to your Milestones.

[Illustration]

Bombard "the Right Hon. Gentleman opposite" with questions. Ask him for
particulars about the Milestones in the Old Kent Road and on Salisbury
Plain. If he requests notice, give him notice. By degrees you will find
that you are becoming an institution. Milestones are your specialty.
When the House is sitting demand particulars. When the House is up,
write to the papers. Move for returns about Milestones. Go down to
Slocum-on-the-Marsh and read papers on Milestones. If possible, be made
a F.S.A. on the strength of your knowledge of Milestones. So identify
yourself with Milestones that when your name is casually mentioned
anywhere, let it be common form for some one to say, "Of course, the
chap who looks after the Milestones."

Wait patiently until your side move over from the Opposition to the
Government benches. Then will come your opportunity. You will have sat
upon a Milestone Commission. You have been very instrumental in getting
Milestones polished. You have caused Milestones to be multiplied. All
these services must be recognised. And they will.

You will find yourself offered the Secretaryship of the Public Squander
Department--to take care of the Milestones. Accept it. You will now have
become a Civil Servant. On some future occasion I may suggest how you
may successfully perform your duties in your new position.

PART XVIII.--THE LAST STRAW.

SCENE XXVII. (_continued_).--_The Chinese Drawing Room._ SPURRELL'S
_ingenuous remark upon the coincidence of the title of the volume in his
hand with the name of his bull-dog has produced a painful silence, which
no one has sufficient presence of mind to break for several seconds._

_Miss Spelwane_ (_to herself_). Not CLARION BLAIR! Not even a poet! I--I
could _slap_ him!

_Pilliner_ (_to himself_). Poor dear VIVIEN! But if people will insist
on patting a strange poet, they mustn't be surprised if they get a nasty
bite!

_Lady Maisie_ (_to herself_). He _didn't_ write _Andromeda!_ Then he
hasn't got my letter after all! And I've been such a _brute_ to the poor
dear man! _How_ lucky I said nothing about it to GERALD!

_Captain Thicknesse_ (_to himself_). So he _ain't_ the bard!... Now I
see why MAISIE's been behavin' so oddly all the evenin'; she spotted
him, and didn't like to speak out. Tried to give me a hint, though.
Well, I shall stay out my leave now!

_Lady Rhoda_ (_to herself_). I thought all along he seemed too good a
sort for a poet!

_Archie_ (_to himself_). It's all very well; but how about that skit he
went up to write on us? He _must_ be a poet of sorts.

_Mrs. Brooke-Chatteris_ (_to herself_). This is fearfully puzzling. What
made him say that about "Lady Grisoline"?

_The Bishop_ (_to himself_). A crushing blow for the Countess; but not
unsalutary. I am distinctly conscious of feeling more kindly disposed to
that young man. Now why?

    [_He ponders._

_Lady Lullington_ (_to herself_). I thought this young man was going to
read us some of his poetry; it's too tiresome of him to stop to tell us
about his bull-dog. As if anybody cared _what_ he called it!

_Lord Lullington_ (_to himself_). Uncommonly awkward, this! If I could
catch LAURA'S eye--but I suppose it would hardly be decent to go just
yet.

_Lady Culverin_ (_to herself_). Can ROHESIA have known this? What
possible object could she have had in----And oh, dear, how disgusted
RUPERT will be!

_Sir Rupert_ (_to himself_). Seems a decent young chap enough! Too bad
of ROHESIA to let him in for this. I don't care a straw what he is--he's
none the worse for not being a poet.

_Lady Cantire_ (_to herself_). What _is_ he maundering about? It's
utterly inconceivable that _I_ should have made any mistake. It's only
too clear what the cause is--_Claret!_

_Spurrell_ (_aloud, good-humouredly_). Too bad of you to try and spoof
me like this before everybody, Miss SPELWANE! I don't know whose idea it
was to play me such a trick, but----

_Miss Spelw._ (_indistinctly_). Please understand that nobody here had
the _least_ intention of playing a trick upon you!

_Spurr._ Well, if you say so, of course----But it looked rather like it,
asking me to read when I've about as much poetry in me as--as a pot hat!
Still, if I'm _wanted_ to read aloud, I shall be happy to oblige----

_Lady Culv._ (_hastily_). Indeed, _indeed_, Mr. SPURRELL, we couldn't
think of troubling you under the circumstances! (_In desperation._)
VIVIEN, my dear, won't you _sing_ something?

    [_The company echo the request with unusual eagerness._

_Spurr._ (_to himself, during_ Miss SPELWANE'S _song_). Wonder what's
put them off being read to all of a sudden. (_As his eye happens to rest
on the binding of the volume on his knee._) Hullo! This cover's pink,
with silver things, not unlike cutlets, on it! Didn't EMMA ask me----?
By George, if it's _that!_ I may get down to the Housekeeper's Room,
after all! As soon as ever this squalling stops I'll find out; I _can't_
go on like this! (Miss SPELWANE _leaves the piano; everybody plunges
feverishly into conversation on the first subject--other than poetry or
dogs--that presents itself, until_ Lord _and_ Lady LULLINGTON _set a
welcome example of departure._) Better wait till these county nobs have
cleared, I suppose--there goes the last of 'em--now for it!... (_He
pulls himself together, and approaches his host and hostess._) Hem, Sir
RUPERT, and your ladyship, it's occurred to me that it's just barely
possible you may have got it into your heads that I was something in the
_poetical_ way.

_Sir Rup._ (_to himself_). Not this poor young chap's fault; must let
him down as easily as possible! (_Aloud._) Not at all--not at all!
Ha--assure you we quite understand; no necessity to say another word
about it.

_Spurr._ (_to himself_). Just my luck! They quite understand! No
Housekeeper's Room for me this journey! (_Aloud._) Of course I knew the
Countess, there, and Lady MAISIE, were fully aware all along----(_To_
Lady MAISIE, _as stifled exclamations reach his ear._) You _were_,
weren't you?

_Lady Maisie_ (_hastily_). Yes, yes, Mr. SPURRELL. Of course! It's all
_perfectly_ right!

_Spurr._ (_to the others_). You see, I should never have thought of
coming in as a visitor if it hadn't been for the Countess; she would
_have_ it that it was all right, and that I needn't be afraid I
shouldn't be welcome.

_Lady Culv._ To be sure--any friend of my sister-in-law's----

_Lady Cant._ ALBINIA, I have refrained from speech as long as possible;
but this is really _too_ much! You _don't_ suppose I should have
introduced Mr. SPURRELL here unless I had had the strongest reasons for
knowing, however he may be pleased to mystify us now, that he, and
nobody else, is the author of _Andromeda!_ And I, for one, absolutely
decline to believe in this preposterous story of his about a bull-dog.

_Spurr._ But your ladyship must have known! Why, you as good as asked me
on the way here to put you down for a bull-pup!

_Lady Cant._ Never, never! A bull-pup is the last creature I should ever
dream of coveting. You were obliging enough to ask me to accept a
presentation copy of your verses.

_Spurr._ Was I? I don't exactly see how I _could_ have been, considering
I never made a rhyme in my life!

_Sir Rup._ There, there, ROHESIA, it was _your_ mistake; but as we are
indebted to it for the pleasure of making Mr. SPURRELL's
acquaintance----

_Lady Cant._ I am not in the habit of making mistakes, RUPERT. I don't
know what you and ALBINIA and MAISIE may know that I am in ignorance of,
but, since you seem to have been aware from the first that Mr. SPURRELL
was not the poet you had invited here to meet me, will you kindly
explain what has become of the _real_ author?

_Sir Rup._ My dear ROHESIA, I don't know and I don't _care!_

_Lady Cant._ There you are _wrong_, RUPERT, because it's obvious that if
he is not Mr. SPURRELL, his absence has to be accounted for in _some_
way.

_Spurr._ By Jove, I believe I can put you on the track. I shouldn't
wonder if he's the party these dress clothes of mine belong to! I
daresay you may have noticed they don't look as if they were made for
me?

_Lady Cant._ (_closing her eyes_). Pray let us avoid any sartorial
discussions! We are waiting to hear about this person.

_Spurr._ Well, I found I'd got on his things by mistake, and I went up
as soon as I could after dessert to my room to take 'em off, and there
he was, with a waste-paper basket on his head----

_Lady Cant._ A waste-paper basket on his head! And pray what should he
have _that_ for?

_Spurr._ He said he wouldn't take it off till he saw me. And I never saw
anyone in such a mess with ink and flour as he was!

_Lady Cant._ Ink and flour, indeed! This rigmarole gets more ridiculous
every moment! You can't seriously expect anyone here to believe it!

    [ARCHIE _discreetly retires to the smoking-room._

_Spurr._ Well, I rather think somebody must have fixed up a booby trap
for _me_, you know, and he happened to go in first and get the benefit
of it. And he was riled, very naturally, thinking _I_'d done it, but
after we'd had a little talk together, he calmed down and said I might
keep his clothes, which I thought uncommonly good-natured of him, you
know. By the way, he gave me his card. Here it is, if your ladyship
would like to see it.

    [_He hands it to_ Lady CULVERIN.

_Lady Culv._ "Mr. UNDERSHELL!" ... ROHESIA, that _is_ CLARION BLAIR! I
_knew_ it was _something_ ending in "ell." (_To_ SPURRELL.) And you say
Mr. UNDERSHELL is here--in this house?

_Spurr._ Not now. He's gone by this time.

_The Others_ (_in dismay_). Gone!

_Spurr._ He said he was leaving at once. If he'd only told me how it
was, I'd have----

_Lady Cant._ I don't believe a single word of all this! If Mr. SPURRELL
is not CLARION BLAIR, let him explain how he came to be coming down to
Wyvern this afternoon!

    [_Partial reaction in company._

_Spurr._ If your ladyship doesn't really know, you had better ask Sir
RUPERT; _he_'ll tell you it's all right.

_Lady Cant._ Then perhaps _you_ will be good enough to enlighten us,
RUPERT?

_Sir Rup._ (_driven into a corner_). Why, 'pon my word, I'm bound to say
that I'm just as much in the dark as anybody else, if it comes to that!

_Spurr._ (_eagerly_). But you wired me to come, Sir! About a horse of
yours! I've been wondering all the evening when you'd tell me I could go
round and have a look at him. I'm here instead of Mr. SPAVIN--_now_ do
you understand, Sir RUPERT? I'm the Vet.

    [_Suppressed sensation._

_Sir Rup._ (_to himself_). This is devilish awkward! Don't quite know
what to do. (_Aloud._) To--to be sure you are! Of course! That's it,
ROHESIA! Mr. SPURRELL came down to see a horse, and we shall be very
glad to have the benefit of his opinion by-and-by.

    [_He claps him amicably on the shoulder._

_Lady Cant._ (_in a sepulchral tone_). ALBINIA, I think I will go to
bed.

    [_She withdraws._

_Sir Rup._ (_to himself_). There'll be no harm in letting him stay, now
he _is_ here. If ROHESIA objects, she's got nobody but herself to blame
for it!

_Spurr._ (_to himself_). They won't want to keep me upstairs much longer
after this! (TREDWELL _enters, and seems to have something of importance
to communicate to_ Sir RUPERT _in private._) I wonder what the dooce is
up _now!_

THE NEW CANDIDATE.

DEAR MR. PUNCH,--I trust you will give me the hospitality of your
columns (and thus save me the cost of extensive advertising) to announce
that I intend to offer myself as a candidate for all the eleven
divisions at the forthcoming School Board Election. I do this for
several reasons. In the first place, as I have no more chance in any one
place more than in any other, I feel it quite impossible to make any
choice. Besides, to be elected at the top of eleven polls would be an
unique distinction, second only to being defeated at the bottom of
eleven. In the next place, as I can find no other persons who will come
forward on my platform, I am bound to offer myself everywhere. My views
are extensive, not to say peculiar. On the religious question, I agree
with everything that has been said by everybody. I hope in this way to
avoid incurring _odium theologicum_ of any kind. I am in favour of no
one paying rates unless he has children actually at a Board School. I am
told that this will not secure for me the Labour Vote, but it ought, at
any rate, to rally to my side all the "intelligent and respectable." On
all other points I believe I am well fitted to sit on the London School
Board. I understand that at its meetings oysters and Chablis are
sometimes the order of the day. If I am returned, my main object, I avow
it frankly, will be to make them the standing order. Soliciting the vote
of every patriotic citizen, I am,

  Yours up-to-(being-a-candi-)date,

  _October 27._

AIR--"_The Bold Poacher._"

  When I was bound by Party ties to play the bold Premier,
  I shouldered of my gun, my lads, and started void of fear;
  With my trusty lurcher at my heels, to whom the sport is dear,
  For he's game for fight by day or night at the season of the year!

  As I and my bold comrade were after bird or hare,
  The gamekeeper was watching us; for him we did not care.
  For we were on our ground, my boys, grounds free to tyke or peer;
  And they're my delight by day or night at the season of the year!

  As I and my bold comrade were in the Peers' Preserve,
  We heard the keeper's footsteps, but we did not halt or swerve.
  But I whistled--to keep up my pluck--a song to sportsmen dear:
  "Oh it's my delight on a shiny night, in the season of the year!"

  The Gamekeeper popped through the copse, and faced us with a frown;
  He's got a black-a-vised stern phiz, and a coat o' velvet brown.
  He says "Hillo, Sir! _Poaching?_" I retorts, "Oh, don't _you_ fear!
  A gent may poach his own preserves at the season of the year!"

  He says, "You ought to be ashamed to set so bad example
  A sportsman true won't join the crew who trespass, trap, and trample.
  A dirty bird fouls its own nest!" he adds, with a sour sneer.
  "Swells should not poach by day or night in the season of the year."

  Says I, "You sneer, but I'm your peer, my Sol. The people sent me!
  Stare like an owl, or sneer and scowl, you know you can't prevent me!
  These here Preserves want breaking up, Monopoly's pitch to queer
  Is our delight by day or night, in the season of the year.

  "A-poaching on one's own preserves scarce poaching seems at all.
  My foot is on my native--copse! The old Game Laws must fall.
  The 'Peers' Preserves' the people will throw open--or else clear,
  And you'll have to fight for your old old right at the season of the
      year.

  "You ask me if I like the job? That's neither here nor there!
  I'm simply bound to do it, and I really don't much care.
  If Peers will claim the best o' the game, and strive the rest to
      queer,
  We'll take _our_ right, by day or night, at the season of the year!"

LOCAL COLOUR.

Mr. ASQUITH was reported the other day to have said that the Government
was spoken of as having been accused of refusing so-called amendments to
the Employers' Liability Bill in "_peacock_ temper." The _Daily News_,
in referring to this, suggests that "peacock temper" was a misprint for
"pique, or temper." But surely this is not so. Mr. ASQUITH evidently has
given in his adhesion to the new system of "colour adjectives." This
opens great possibilities to the future. Radicals will denounce the
"scarlet scandals of the purple-clad peers." Tories will wax eloquent on
"the pink miasma of revolutionary Radicalism." No one will know what it
all means, but that is part of the programme. Even if this colour scheme
will not work, there is still a justification for the Asquithian phrase.
Everybody has heard of a "foul slander." Why not a "peacock temper"?

SIR PETER.--A well-written letter in the _Times_ last week puts what
maybe called "The Hard Case of Sir PETER EDLIN"--and, indeed, he
must be pretty well case-hardened at the Middlesex Sessions by this
time--clearly and forcibly before the public. Sir PETER EDLIN, it seems,
has been doing treble the amount of work for a two-third's salary. This
should be righted, and the Judge at the Middlesex Sessions should be
independent of the would-be ubiquitous L. C. C. Such is the opinion of
this Correspondent to the _Times_, and it is doubtless the opinion of a
fair and just majority. As _Joseph Surface_ observes in _The School for
Scandal_, "Well, it will give SIR PETER great satisfaction to hear
_this_."

THE LINKS.

  'Tis a brilliant autumn day,
  And the breeze has blown away
  All the clouds that lowered gray,
              So methinks,
  As I've half an hour to spare,
  I will go and take the air,
  While the weather still is fair,
              On the Links.

  I admire the splendid view,
  The delicious azure hue
  Of the ocean and--when, _whew!_
              With a crack,
  Lo! there drops a little ball
  Which elects to break its fall
  By alighting on the small
              Of my back.

  In the distance some one cries
  Some remark about my eyes,
  None too pleasant, I surmise,
              From the tone;
  So away my steps I turn
  Till a figure I discern,
  Who is mouching by the burn
              All alone.

  He has lost a new "Eclipse,"
  And a little word that slips
  Front his sulky-looking lips
              Tells me true
  That, besides the missing ball,
  Which is gone beyond recall,
  He has lost--what's worst of all--
              Temper too.

  I conclude it will be best
  If I leave him unaddressed,
  Such a melancholy quest
              To pursue;
  And I pass to where I spy
  Clouds of sand uprising high
  Till they all but hide the sky
              From the view.

  They proceed, I understand,
  From a bunker full of sand,
  Where a golfer, club in hand,
              Freely swears
  As he hacks with all his might,
  Till his countenance is quite
  As vermilion as the bright
              Coat he wears.

  I observe him for a while
  With a highly-tickled smile,
  For it is the queerest style
              Ever seen:
  He is very short and stout,
  And he knocks the ball about,
  But he never gets it out
              On the green.

  Still I watch him chop and hack,
  Till I hear a sudden crack,
  And the club-head makes a track
              In the light--
  There' s a startled cry of "FORE!"
  As it flies, and all is o'er!--
  I remember nothing more
              Till to-night,

  When I find myself in bed
  With a lump upon my head
  Like a penny loaf of bread;
              And methinks,
  For the future I'll take care,
  When I want a little air,
  That I won't go anywhere
              Near the Links.

INS AND OUTS.

"Cricket was a far superior game to golf or tennis," said Lord KNUTSFORD
to the members of the Victoria Park Cricket Association; and he went on
to tell a story of the first introduction of cricket to Tonga, one of
the Pacific Islands. Everybody took up the game so heartily that State
affairs were allowed to slide altogether, and at last the King of TONGA
had to lay down rules as to the times when the game might be indulged
in. "Even then the Prime Minister was with difficulty prevented from
bowling during forbidden hours." For Tonga read Westminster--where a
good deal of _tongue_--ah!--goes on--and we get a result something like
this:--

"After the usual luncheon interval, the Leader of the Opposition and the
ex-Umpire-General faced the delivery of the First Commissioner of Stumps
and the Scorin' Secretary. The punishment inflicted by the former on the
bowling led to a Cabinet crisis, ending in the Secretary of State
resigning his office and the leather to the Lord High Wicket-keep. The
result of this change was soon apparent, for the Leader of the
Opposition was clean bowled by a quotation from _Hansard_, and his place
was taken by a prominent member from below the Opposition Gangway.

"As the score still mounted, the Ministry decided to apply the Closure
to the game, an effort which was resisted by the whole force of the
Opposition, armed with pads and wickets. During the all-night innings
which ensued the Prime Minister retired hurt, and the Ministry were
finally driven into the Pavilion, where they expressed a decided
intention, in consequence of the underhand bowling of their opponents,
of at once appealing to the country. The Committee of Lords' has placed
its veto on these disorderly proceedings, and 'Down with the Lords' is
likely to be the Ministerial rallying-cry during the forthcoming
Election."

  And creed's fanatic clamour, valued most
  But her who heads the grave recording host.
  His vivid pictures live; his virile touch
  (Though oft of the too little or too much
  Ardently heedless in his passionate flow
  Of words that wake and thoughts that warmly glow),
  Quickens the past, and moves the patriot heart
  Of British manhood. His the stylist's part,
  The partisan's impressiveness. He missed
  The highest height, clear, cloudless, morning-kissed.
  But long will he be dear to those who love
  The picturings that charm, the words that move;
  And the grave Muse may well let fall a tear,
  And lay her tribute laurel on his bier.

THE ART OF NAVAL PLATITUDE.

MR. PUNCH,--Dear Sir,--As an able-bodied seaman and expert on the marine
serpent and other such questions of the hour, I have been very properly
asked for my opinion on the late collisions in the far East. Lest my
utterances should be misrepresented by journals unaccustomed to deal
with refinements of maritime phraseology, I send you a correct report of
my interview.

[Illustration]

"What deduction," began the reporter from the recesses of a deck-chair
that had figured at Trafalgar, "do you make with regard to the future of
naval warfare from the engagements of which we have lately read such
distracting accounts?"

"My leading deduction," I replied, "is that it is difficult beforehand
to conjecture which side is going to win, and impossible afterwards to
discover which has actually won. History, however, and a long course of
technical experience, alike convince me that, given equal courage and
skill on both sides, vessels equally well equipped and armoured and of
precisely similar shape, tonnage, and fighting power, victory may be
expected, in many cases out of a few more, to fall to the party that is
_numerically the stronger of the two_. You are, perhaps, with me on this
point?"

"I confess," he replied, "that you throw for me a new and lurid light on
a question always difficult for the lay mind to grapple with. But tell
me of the torpedo and its mission."

"The deadliness," I said, "of this modern weapon of naval warfare is to
be fully appreciated by such alone as have been its unhappy victims. In
the incredibly short space of time between the moment of impact
and the decease of those who are, as an immediate result, blown to
indistinguishable atoms, no reliable evidence has, in the nature of
things, been taken down from the lips of the people best qualified to
submit it.

"Disconnected fragments of speech, chiefly of a profane character,
constitute the sole testimony upon which we have to base our
conclusions. But we may safely affirm that one of the most, if not _the_
most, important detail in the manipulation of this projectile is the
aim. Wrongly directed it is comparatively innocuous. In the unavoidable
hurry and confusion of the moment, when the attention of the operator is
diverted by the reiterated play of missiles upon his person, possibly a
prey at the very time to insufferable nausea, it is almost impossible to
guarantee the missile from aberration. You will pardon my
technicalities?"

"I thank you," he replied, "and I follow you. But in what way do you
account for the success of the Japanese with these submarine weapons?"

"Peruse the reports," I answered, "and draw your own deductions. '_On
the morning of the 18th_' (the morrow of the battle) '_the Japanese
flotilla of torpedo-boats returned to the Yalu and leisurely destroyed
with torpedoes several stranded Chinese vessels_.'

"Here we have the best conceivable endorsement of my views. That which
in the excitement of the fray they were impotent to achieve, this, with
fitting leisure, unhampered by the annoyance of hostile opposition, and
with the object rigidly fixed, as in a vice, they effected with
unqualified and unquestioned success."

Dazzled by my reflections he proceeded to put a fresh conundrum to me.
"What say you," he asked, "to the resources of China? I see that the
Dowager Empress has sent three millions of taels to the forces."

"The tael," I explained, "is excellent eating. I perceive no immediate
reason for the evacuation of Peking as far as the supply of game is
concerned. This, however, is a side issue, and not strictly nautical in
its bearing.

"To proceed at once, and in conclusion, to the matter of our own naval
supremacy" (for I saw this inevitable question already framed on his
lips), "I will give you in a word the accumulated wisdom of long years
of naval intuition. My motto is '_Always win!_'

"Once let the enemy, however inferior, win, and for the time being you
are beaten. We are--and here I rely not only on my own observation, but
on the testimony of countless myriads of my species--_we are an
insular nation_. Further, _our commerce is largely dependent on our
merchandise_. It was not till I had realised to the full these two
momentous and crucial facts that I arrived at the conclusion which I
have already imparted to you, and now venture to repeat--'_Always win!_'
You bear me out, I imagine?"

"I bear myself," he affably replied; thus concluding an interview in the
course of which there had been no manner of hitch except the usual
nautical one at the moment of his coming aboard; and that was due not to
the absence of braces, but to respect for my position as an Admiralty
Crichton.

There, _Mr. Punch_, you are welcome to make any use you will of a
statement that contains practically and tactically the final word on the
future of naval warfare.

  _Crede_, dear Sir,

  Yours unusually

  EXPERTO.

     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
