The Temple of Glass
by
John Lydgate

Printed at Westminster
by William Caxton about the year
1477

Cambridge

1905





The unique book here reprinted in facsimile came to the Cambridge
University Library in a famous volume of tracts described by Mr Blades
(Biography and Typography of W. Caxton, 1882, p. 201).

The volume had formed part of the collection of John Moore, Bishop of
Ely, which was given to the University by King George the First in 1715.

The first leaf, which is wanting, was probably blank.

.The temple of glas.


For thought constreynt & greuous heuynes
For pensifhed and hig[=h] distres
To bed I went now this other nyght
Whan that lucina wit[=h] hir pale light
Was Ioyned last wit[=h] phebus in aquarye
Amyd decembre, whan of Ianuarye
Ther be kalendes of the new yere
And derk dyane horned and nothing clere
Had her beames vnder a mysty cloude
Wit[=h] in my bed for cold I gan me shroude
Al desolate for constraynt of my woo
The long nyght walowyng to and fro
Til at laste er I began take kepe
Me dyde oppresse a sodeyn dedly slepe
Wit[=h] in the whiche me thoug[=h]t I was
Rauysshed in spiryte in to a temple of glas
I nyste how fer in wildernes
That founded was as by liklynes
Not vpon stele, but on a craggy roche
Lyke yse y froze, and as I did approche
Agayn the sonne that shone so clere

As ony Cristal and euer ner and ner
As I cam nyghe this grisly dredful place
I wex astonyed, the light so in my face
Be gan to smyte, so persing euer in one
On euery part wher that I gan gone
That I ne might no thing as I wolde
Aboute me considere and beholde
The wonder estres for brightnes of the sonne
Til atte last certayn skyes donne
Wit[=h] wynde chaced han her cours y went
To fore the stremes of titan and y blent
So that I mighte wit[=h] in and wit[=h] oute
Wherso I wolde beholden me aboute
For to reporte the fac[=o]n and manere
Of a[=ll] this place that was circuler
In compas wyse, round by entayle wrought
And whan I had longe gone and sought
I found a wiket and entred in as fast
In to the temple and myn eyen cast
On euery syde now lowe eft alofte
And right anon as I gan walken softe
Yf I the sot[=h] a right reporte shal
I sawe depeynted vpon a wal

From este to weste many a fair ymage
Of sondry louers lyke as they were of age
Y sette in ordre after they were trewe
Wit[=h] liuely colours wonder fresh of hue
And as me thought I sawe som sitte & som st[=a]de
And so[=m]e knelyng wit[=h] billes in their hande
And so[=m]e wit[=h] compleynt woful & pietous
Wit[=h] doleful chere to putten to venus
So as she sat fleetyng in the see
Vpon her woo forto haue pitee
And first of alle I saug[=h] there of cartage
Dido the quene so goodly of visage
That gan compleyne hir auenture and cas
How she deceyued was of Eneas
For al his hestes and his othes sworn
And said alas that euer she was born
Whan she sawe that ded she must be
And next I sawe the compleynt of Medee
How that she falsed was of Iason
And nyg[=h] by venus sawe I sitte atheon
And al the maner how the boor hym sloug[=h]
For whom she wepte and had pyne ynoug[=h]
Ther saw I also how that penolope

For she so longe her lord ne mighte see
Was of colour bothe pale and grene
And after next was the fresh quene
I mene alcest the noble trewe wyf
And for admete hou she lost her lif
And for her trout[=h] yf I shal not lye
How she was torned in to a daysye
Ther was Grisildes Innocence
And al her mekenes and pacience
There was eke Isode & many other moo
And al the torment and the cruel woo
That she had for tristram al her lyue
And how that Tisbe her hert dyde ryue
Wit[=h] thilk swerd of sir Piramus
And al the maner hou that Theseus
The mynotaure slow amyd the hous
That was forwrynked by crafte of dedalus
Whan he was in pryson shit in Crete
And how that philles felte of loues hete
The grete fyre of demephon allas
And for his falshed and for his trespas
Vpon the walles depeynt men might see
How she henge vpon a fylberd tree

And many a story moo than I rekene can
Were in the temple, and how that paris wan
The fayr Eleyne a lusty fresh quene
And hou Achilles was for Policene
Y slayn vnwarly wit[=h]yn Troye toun
Al this sawe I walkyng vp and doun
Ther sawe I wreton eke the hole tale
How Philomene in to a nyghtyngale
Y torned was, and proigne vnto a swalowe
And how the sabyns in their maner halowe
The feste of lucresse yet in Rome toun
Ther saw I also the sorow of Palamon
That he in prison felte and al the smert
And how that he thurg[=h] vnto his hert
Was hurt vnwarly by castyng of an eye
On fair fresh the lusty yong Emelye
And al the stryf bytwene hym & his brother
And how that one faug[=h]t wit[=h] that other
Wit[=h]yn the groue, til they by Theseus
Accorded were as Chaucer tellet[=h] vs
And furthermore as I gan beholde
I sawe hou phebus wit[=h] an arowe of golde
Y wounded was thurg[=h] out his syde

Only by enuye of the god Cupyde
And how that dyane vnto a laurer tre
Y torned was whan that she dide fle
And how that Ioue changed his cope
Only for loue of the fair Eurepe
And in to a hole, whan he did he sue
Liste of his godhed his fourme to transmue
And hou that he by transmutacion
The shap gan take of Amphitrion
For Alcumena so passing was of beaute
So was he hurt for al his deyte
Wit[=h] louys dart, and might it not escape
Ther sawe I also how mars was take
Of vulcanus and wit[=h] venus founde
And wit[=h] the cheynes Inuysible bounde
Ther was also al the poesye
Of hym Mercurye and al the philogye
And how that she for her sapience
Y wedded was to the god of eloquence
And how the Muses lowly did obeye
Hig[=h] in to heuyn this lady to conueye
And wit[=h] her songe hou she was magnefied
Wit[=h] Jubiter there to be stellefied

And vppermore depeynt men might see
How wit[=h] her ryng the goodly canace
Of euery fowle, the leydons and songe
Coude vnderstond as she walked them among
And hou her brother so often holpen was
In his myschief, by the stede of bras
And furthermore in the temple were
Ful many a thousand louers here & there
In sondry wyse redy to compleyne
Vnto the goddesse, of her woo and peyne
How they were hyndred som for enuye
And how the serpent of fals Ielousie
Ful many a louer hath put a back
And causeles on them haue leid a lack
And so[=m]e ther were that playned on absence
That were exiled and put out of presence
Thurg[=h] wicked tunges and fals suspec[=o]n
Wit[=h]oute mercy or ony remissi[=o]n
And other eke her seruyse spent in veyn
And of her lady were not loued ageyn
And other eke that for pouerte
Dursten in no wyse her grete aduersite
Discouere ne opene, lest they were refused

And so[=m]e for wantyng also were accused
And other eke that loued secretly
And of her lady durst axe no mercy
Lest that she wolde of hym haue despyte
And so[=m]e also that putten right grete wite
Ou double louers that loue thinges newe
Thurg[=h] whos falsenes hyndred be the trewe
And so[=m] there were as hit is ofte founde
That for her lady many a blody wounde
Endured hat[=h] in many a regyon
Whiles that an other hat[=h] had possession
Al of his lady and beret[=h] a way the fruyt
Of his labour and of a[=ll] his fuyt
And other compleyned of richesse
How he wit[=h] tresour dot[=h] his besynesse
To wynne agaynst al kynde and right
Where as true louers haue force none ne might
And som ther were as maydyns yong of age
That pleynet[=h] so wit[=h] pipyng & wit[=h] rage
That were coupled agayn al nature
Wit[=h] croked elde that may not long endure
For to perfourme the lust of loues playe
For hit ne fit not vnto fress[=h] maye

For to be coupled to olde Ianuarye
They be so dyuerse that they must varye
For elde is gruoching and malencolious
Ay ful of yre and suspecious
And yongth entendet[=h] to Ioye & lustynes
To mirt[=h] and play and to al gladnes
Allas that euer hit shold falle
So swete sugre y coupled be to galle
These yonge folke cryeden oft sithe
And praid venus her power to kythe
Vpon this myschief and shape remedye
And right anone I herde other crye
Wit[=h] sobbyng teres and pietous sowne
To fore the goddesse by lamentacion
That were constrayned in their yougthe
And in childhode as is ofte couthe
Y entrid were in to Religion
Or they had yeris of discresc[=o]n
That al her lif can not but compleyne
In wyde Copes perfection forto feyne
Ful couertly for to coueren thair smert
And shewe the contrary of thair hert
Thus saw I wepe many a fair mayde

That on theyr frendes al the wyte thay layde
And other next I saw ther in grete rage
That they were maried in theyr tendre age
Wit[=h] oute fredom of fre election
Where loue hat[=h] selde domynacion
For loue at large and at liberte
Wolde frely chese and not wit[=h] suche trete
And other saw I ful ofte wepe and wrynge
That they in men fonde suche varyynge
To loue a season whyle that beaulte flourit[=h]
And after by disdayn so vngoodly lourit[=h]
On her that whylom he callyd his lady dere
That was to hym so playsant and entier
But lust wit[=h] fairnes is so ouer goon
That in her herte trouthe abidet[=h] noon
And so[=m]e also I sawe in teres reyne
And pietously on god and kynde pleyne
That euer they wold on ony creature
So moche beaute passing be mesure
Sette on a woman to yeue occasion
A man, to loue to his confusion
And namely there, where he shal haue no grace
For wit[=h] a loke fort[=h] by as he dot[=h] pace

Ful ofte fallet[=h] thurg[=h] castyng of an eye
A man is wounded that he must nedis deye
That neuer peraunter after he shal her see
Why wil god don so grete a cruelte
To ony man, or to his creature
To make hym so muche woo endure
For her, percas, whom he shal in no wyse
Reioyse neuer, but so fort[=h] in Iuyse
Lede his lif til that he be graue
For he ne durst of hir no mercy craue
And eke [per]aunter thoug[=h] he durst & wolde
He can not wite where he hir fynd sholde
I sawe ther eke, and therof had I couthe
That som were hyndred by couetyse & slougthe
And so[=m]e also for their hastynes
And other eke for their rechelesnes
But altherlast as I walked and behelde
Beside pallas wit[=h] her Cristal sheld
Tofore the statue of venus set on height
Ther kneled a lady in my sight
To fore the goddesse, whiche as the sonne
Passet[=h] the sterris, and eke the stormys donne
And lucifer to voyde the nyghtes sorowe

In clerenes passet[=h] erly the morowe
And so as maye hat[=h] the souereynte
Of euery monet[=h] the fayrnes and beaute
And as the rose in swetnes and odour
Surmounted flouris, and baine of al licour
Hath the pryse, and as the rubye bright
Of al stones in beaute and in sight
As it is knowe hat[=h] the Regalye
Right so this ladye wit[=h] her goodly eye
And wit[=h] the stremys of hir loke so bright
Surmountet[=h] al thourg[=h] beaute in my sight
That for to tel her grete semelines
Her womanhed her porte and her fairnes
Hit was a meruayle, how euer that nature
Cowde in her werkes make a creature
So angelyk so goodly on to see
So femynyn or passing of beaute
Whos sonnys[=h] heer brighter than goldwire
Lyche phebus beames shynyng in his spyre
The goodlihed eke of her fres[=h] face
So replenyshed of beaute and of grace
So wel ennewed by nature and depeynt
As Rose and lilyes to gyder were meynt

So egally by good proporcion
That as me tought by myn inspection
I gan meruaylle hou god or werk of kynde
Mighten of beaute suche a tresour fynde
To yeuen hir so passing excellence
For in good fait[=h] thurg[=h] her hye presence
The temple was ensumyned enuyron
And forto speke of her condicion
She was the beste that might be on lyue
For ther was none [that] wit[=h] her might stryue
To speke of bounte or of gentilesse
Of womanhede or of lowlynesse
Of curtoysie or of goodlihede
Of speche of chere or of semelihede
Of poort benigne or of daliaunce
The best taught and therto of playsaunce
She was the welle eke of honeste
An Examplair and mirrour eke was she
Of secretnes of trouthe of feit[=h]fulnes
And to alle other lady and maistres
To shewe vertu who so list to lere
And so this lady right humble of chere
Kneling I sawe, clad in grene and whyte

To fore venus goddesse of al delyte
Enbrowded al wit[=h] stones and perre
So richely that Ioye it was to see
Wit[=h] sondry rolles on her garnement
For texpowne the trout[=h] of her entent
To shewe fully that for her humblesse
And for her vertu and her stablenesse
That she was cote of al womanly playsance
Therfore her word wit[=h]oute variance
Enbrowded was as men might see
De mieulx en mieulx wit[=h] stones of perre
This is to sayne that she was so benygne
From better to better her hert dot[=h] resigne
And al her wy[=ll] to venus the goddesse
Whan that her list her harmes to redresse
For as me thought somwhat by her chere
For to compleyne she had grete desire
For in her hand she held a lityl bylle
For to declare the su[=m]e of al her wylle
And to the goddesse her quarel for to shewe
Theffect of whiche was in wordes fewe

.The copye of the supplicacion.





O lady venus moder of cupyde
That in this world hast the gouernance
And hertes hye that hawteyn be by pryde
Enclynest mekely to thyn obeyssance
Causer of Ioye Relees of penance
And with thy stremes canst euery thing discer[=n]
Thurg[=h] heuenly fire of loue that is eter[=n]

O blesful sterre persaunt and ful of light
Of beames gladsom, deuoyder of derknes
Chief recomfort after the blak nyght
To wyde woful hertes out of theyr heuynes
Take now good hede lady and goddesse
So that my bille may your grace attayne
Redresse to fynde of that I me compleyne

For I am bounde to thing that I nolde
Frely to chese ther lack I liberte
And so I want of that myn herte wolde
The body is knyt, thoug[=h] my thought be fre
So that I muste of necessite
My hertes lyst outward contrarye
Thoug[=h] we be oon the dede muste varye

My worship sauf I faylle election
Agayn al right bot[=h] of god and kynde
Therto be knyt vnder subiection
For whens for bot[=h] ar out of mynde
My thought got[=h] furt[=h] my body is behynde
For I am here, and yond my remembrance
Betwene two so hange I in balance

Deuoyde of Ioye, of woo I haue plente
What I desire, that may I not possede
For that I nolde is redy ay to me
And that I loue, for to sue I drede
To my desire contrary is my mede
And thus I stonde departed in tweyne
Of wy[=ll] and dede ylaced in a cheyne

For thoug[=h] I brenne wit[=h] feruence & hete
Wit[=h]yn myn herte I mote compleyne of colde
And by excesse thoug[=h] I swelte and swete
Me to compleyne god wote I am not bolde
Vnto no wight, ner one word vnfolde
Of al my peyne, allas the hard stounde
The hotter that I brenne, [the] colder is my wounde

For he that hat[=h] myn hert feyt[=h]fully
And hool my loue in al honeste
Wit[=h]oute chaunge al be hit secretly
I haue no space wit[=h] hym for to be
O lady venus consider now and see
Vnto theffecte and compleynt of my by[=ll]
Sit[=h] lyf and det[=h] I put a[=ll] in thy wy[=ll]

And tho me thought the goddes did enclyne
Mekely her hede and softly gan expresse
That in short tyme her torment shold fyne
And how of hym for whom al her distresse
Contynned had and al her heuynesse
She shold haue Ioye and of her purgatorye
Be holpen sone and so lyue fort[=h] in glorye

And said doughter for thy sad trouthe
Thy fait[=h]ful menyng and Innocence
That planted be wit[=h] outen ony slouthe
In your persone deuoyed of al offence
So han they atteyned to our audience
That wit[=h] our grace ye shal be wel releuyd
I you behete of al that hat[=h] you greuyd

And for that ye be euer of one entent
Wit[=h]oute chaunge or mutabilyte
And in your paynes ben so pacient
To take lowly your aduersyte
And that so longe thurgh the cruelte
Of olde saturne my fader vnfortuned
Your woo shal now no lenger be contuned

And thinket[=h] this wit[=h] in a litil whyle
Hit shal aswage and ouer passen sone
For men by laysir passen many a myle
And ofte after a droppyng mone
The weder cleret[=h], and whan [the] storme is done
The sonne shynet[=h] in his spyer bright
And Ioye waket[=h] whan woo is putto flight

Remembre eke how neuer yet no wight
Ne cam to worship wit[=h] out som debate
And folke reioyse also more of light
That they wit[=h] derknes were waped & mate
No ma[=n]s cha[=n]ce is allewey fortunate
Ne no wight preyset[=h] of sugre the swetnes
But they to fore haue tasted bitternes

Gryssyld was asayed atte fu[=ll]
That torned after to encrese of Ioye
Penolope gan eke for sorowes dulle
For that her lord abode so long at troye
Also the torment ther coude noman accoye
Of dorygene flour of al Bretaigne
Thus euer Ioye is fyn and ende of payne

And trustet[=h] this for conclusion
The ende of sorow is Ioye voyde of drede
For hoolly seyntes thurg[=h] her passion
Haue heuyn wonne by their souerain mede
And plente gladly folowet[=h] after nede
And so my doughter after your greuaunce
I you behote ye shal haue ful plesaunce

For euer of loue the maner and the gyse
Is for to hurte his seruaunt & to wounde
And whan he hat[=h] taught them his empryse
He can in Ioye make them to habounde
And sit[=h] that ye haue in my laas be bounde
Wit[=h] oute gruoching or rebellyon
Ye muste of night haue consolacion

This to sayne dowtet[=h] neuer a deel
That ye shal haue ful possession
Of hym that ye now cherisshe so weel
In honest maner wit[=h] oute offencion
By cause I knowe youre entencion
Is truly sette in party and in a[=ll]
To loue hym best and most in specia[=ll]

For he that ye haue chosen you to serue
Shal be to you suche as ye desire
Wit[=h] oute chaunge fully til he sterue
So wit[=h] my bronde I haue sette hym a fyre
And wit[=h] my grace I shal hym so enspyre
That he in herte shal be right at your wylle
Wherso you liste to saue hym or to spylle

For vnto you I shal his herte so lowe
Wit[=h] oute spotte of ony doblenesse
That he ne shal escape from the bowe
Thaug[=h] that hym self by vnstedfastnesse
I mene of cupide that shal hym so distresse
Vnto your honde wit[=h] tharowe of golde
That he ne shal escapen thaugh he wolde

And sith ye list of pyte and of grace
In vertu only his yonghthe to cherisshe
I shal by aspectes of my benigne face
Make hym beschewe euery synne and vice
So that he shal haue no maner spice
In his corage to loue thinges newe
He shal to yow so playn be found and trewe

And whan this goodly fair fress[=h] of hue
Humble and benygne of trout[=h] crop & rote
Conceyued had how venus gan to rewe
On her prayer plainly to do bote
To chaunge her bitter attones in to sote
She fyl on knees of hig[=h] deuocion
And in this wyse began her orison

Hyghest of hye quene and Emperice
Goddesse of loue, of good yet the best
That thurg[=h] your beaute wit[=h]oute vice
Whylom conquerd thappel atte fest
That Iubiter thurg[=h] his hye request
To alle the goddes aboue celestyal
Made in his palais most Imperyal

To you my lady vpholder of my lyf
Mekely I thanke so as I may suffise
That ye list now wit[=h] herte ententyf
So graciously for me to deuyse
That whyle I lyue wit[=h] humble sacrefise
Vpon your auters your fest yer by yer
I shal encence casten in to the fyre

For of your grace I am ful reconsiled
From euery troble vnto ioye and ease
That sorowes alle be from me exiled
Sit[=h] ye my lady list now tappease
My paynes olde and fully my disease
Vnto gladnes so sodenly to torne
Hauyng no cause from hens fort[=h] to morne

For sithen ye so mekely liste to daunte
To my seruise hym that louet[=h] me best
And of your bounte so graciously to graunte
That he ne shal barye thoug[=h] hym leste
Wherof myn herte is fully brought to reste
For now and euer o lady myn benigne
That hert and wi[=ll] I hooly to you resigne

Thankyng you wit[=h] al my ful herte
That of your grace and visitacion
So humble liste hym to conuerte
Fully to ben at my subiection
Wit[=h] oute chaunge or transmutacion
Vnto his laste, now laude and reuerence
Be to your name and excellence

This al and sum and chief of my request
And hool substance of my ful entente
You thankyng euer of your graunt & hest
Bot[=h] now and euer that ye me grace sent
To conquer hym that neuer shal repent
Me for to serue and humblye for to please
As fynal tresour of my hertes ease

And than anon venus cast a doun
In to her lappe braunches whyte and grene
Of hawthorn that wenten enuyron
Aboute her heed that ioye was to sene
And had her kepe hem honestly and clene
Whiche shold not fade ne neuer wexe olde
Yf she her biddyng kepe as she hat[=h] told

And as these vowes be bothe fair and swete
Folowe theffecte that they do specifye
This is to seyne bot[=h] in cold and hete
Be ye of one hert and of one fantasye
As ar these leues whiche may not dye
By no duresse of stormes that be kene
Nomore in wynter than in somer grene

Right so by ensample of wele or woo
For Ioye torment or for aduersite
Whether so fortune fauoure, or be foo
For pouert riches or prosperyte
That ye your hert kepe in on degre
To loue hym best for no thing that ye fyne
Whom I haue bound so low vnder your cheyne

And wit[=h] [that] word the goddesse shoke her heed
And was in pees & spack as tho nomore
And therwit[=h] a[=ll] ful femynyn of drede
Me thought this lady sighen gan ful sore
And said agayn, lady that maist restore
Hertes in Ioye from theyr aduersite
To do your wil de mieulx en mieulx ma gree

Thus euer slepyng dremyng as I laye
Wit[=h]yn the temple me thought I saye
Grete prees of folk wit[=h] murmur wonderful
To croude and shoue, the temple was so ful
Eueric[=h] ful besy, in his owne cause
That I ne may shortly in a clause
Discriuen alle the rites and the guyse
And eke I wante connyng to deuyse
How so[=m]e ther were wit[=h] blood, encence & milk
And so[=m]e wit[=h] flouris sote & softe as silk
And so[=m]e wit[=h] sparowes & douues whyte
That for to offren gan hem delyte
Vnto the goddesse wit[=h] sighe and prayer
Hem to relese of that they most desire
That for the prees shortly to conclude
I wente my way for the multitude
Me for to refress[=h] out of the prees allone
And by my self me thought as I gan gone
Wit[=h] in the estres and gan a whyle tarye
I sawe a man that walked al solitarye
That as me semed for heuynes and dole
Hym to compleyne, that he walked so sole
Wit[=h] oute espyyng of ony other wight

And yf I s[=h]al diseryuen hym a right
Yf that he had not ben in heuynes
Me thought he was, to speke of semelines
Of shap of fourme, and also of stature
The most passing, that euer yet nature
Made in her werkes, and lyke to be a man
And ther wit[=h] al as I reherce can
Of face and chere the most gracyous
To be biloued happy and ewrous
Bur as it semed outward by his chere
That he complayned for lack of his desire
For by hym self as he walked vp and doun
I herde hym make a lamentacion
And said alas, what thing may this be
That now am bonde that whylom was fre
And wente at large at myn election
Now am I caught vnder subiection
For to become a beray homager
To god of loue, wher er I cam here
Felt in myn herte, nought of loues peyne
But now of newe, wit[=h]in hur firy cheyne
I am embraced so that I may not stryue
To serue and loue whyle I am on lyue

The godly freshe in the temple yonder
I sawe right now, that I had wonder
How euer god, for to rekene a[=ll]
Might make a thing so celestia[=ll]
So angelike on erthe to appere
For wit[=h] the stremes of her eyen clere
I am wounded euen to the hert
That fro the det[=h] I may not astert
And most I meruayle that so sodeinly
I was so yolde to be at hur mercy
Wit[=h]oute more, I muste her lust obeye
Whether that she liste me to lyue or deye
And take mekely my sodeyn auenture
For sit[=h] my lif, my det[=h], and eke my cure
Is in her hand it wil not auaylle
To gruoche agayn, for of this bataylle
The palme is heris, and plainly the victorye
Yf I rebellid honour none ne glorye
I might not in ony wyse achyeue
Sit[=h] I am [the]olden, how shold I thenne preue
To renne a wey, I wote hit wil not be
Thoug[=h] I be loos, at large I may not fle
O god of loue how sharp is now thyn arowe

How mayst thou now so cruelly and so narowe
Wit[=h] oute cause hurte me and wounde
And takest none hede my sorowes to founde
But liche a birde that fleet[=h] at her desire
Tyl sodeynly wit[=h]yn the pantere
She is caught thaug[=h] late she was at large
Anewe tempest forcastet[=h] now my barge
Now vp now doun, wit[=h] wynd it is so blowe
So am I possed and almost ouerthrowe
For dryue in derknes of many sondry wawe
Alas whan shal this tempest ouerdrawe
To clere the skyes of myn aduersite
The lode sterre whan that I ne may see
Hit is so hid wit[=h] clowdes that be blake
Alas whan wy[=ll] this torment ouerslake
I can not wyte, for who is hurt of newe
And bledet[=h] inward til he wex pale of hue
And hat[=h] his wound vnwarly fress[=h] & grene
And hit is not couthe vnto the harmes kene
Of myghty cupyde that can so hertes daunte
That no man may in his warre hym vaunte
To gete a pryce but only by mekenes
For ther ne haylet[=h] stryf ne sturdynes

So may I sayne that wit[=h] a loke am yolde
And haue no power to stryue thaug[=h] I wolde
Thus stonde I euer betwix lif and det[=h]
To loue and serue whyle I haue bret[=h]
In suche a place where I dar not pleyne
Liche hym that is in torment and in peyne
And knowet[=h] not to whom to discure
For ther that I haue holly set my aire
I dar not wel for drede ne for daunger
And for vnknowen tellen how the fyre
Of loues bronde is kyndlid in my breste
Thus am I murdred and slayn atte leste
So priuely wit[=h]yn my thought
O lady venus whom I haue sought
So wysse me now what me is best to doo
That am distraught wit[=h] my self so
That I ne wote what way for to torne
Sauf by my self soleyn for to morne
Hangyng in balance betwix hope and drede
Wit[=h] oute comfort remedye or rede
For hope biddet[=h] pursue and assaye
And agaynward drede answert[=h] naye
And now wit[=h] hope I am set a lofte

But drede and daunger hard & nothyng softe
Hat[=h] ouerthrowe my trust and put a doun
Now at my large, now fetred in prisoun
Now in torment, now in souerayn glorye
Now in paradyse and now in purgatorye
As man dispayred in a double were
Born vp wit[=h] hope, and the[=n]e anon daunger
Me drawet[=h] aback, and sait[=h] it shal not be
For where as I of myne aduersite
Am bolde somwhyle mercy to requyre
Thenne comet[=h] dispair & gynnet[=h] me to lere
A newe lesson to hope ful the contrary
They be so diuerse they wil do me varye
And thus I stand dismayed in a traunce
For whan that hope were likly me tauaunce
For drede I tremble & dar one word not speke
And yf hit so be, that I not out breke
To telle the harmes that greuen me so sore
But in my self encrece them more and more
And to be slayn fully me delyte
When of my det[=h] she is nothing to wyte
For but yf she my constreynt plainly knewe
How shold she euer, on my peynes rue

Thus oft tyme wit[=h] hope I am meuyd
To tel her a[=ll], how I am greuyd
And to be hardy on me for to take
To axe mercy, but drede dot[=h] me the[=n]e awake
And than wanhop answert[=h] me agayn
That better were than she haue disdayn
To dye attones vnknowe of ony wight
And ther wit[=h] a[=ll] biddet[=h] hope anon right
Me, to be bold and prayen her of grace
And fit[=h] alle vertues be portreyd in her face
Hit were not sittyng, that pyte were behynde
And right anon wit[=h]yn my self I fynde
A newe plee brought on me wit[=h] drede
That me so maset[=h] that I see no spede
Be cause he sait[=h] that stonyet[=h] al my blood
I am so symple and she is so good
Thus hope & drede in me wyl not sece
To plete and stryue my harmys to encrece
But at hardest yet or I be dede
Of my distresse sit[=h] I can no rede
But stande do[=m] styl as ony stone
To fore the goddesse I wil me haste ano[=n]
And compleyne wit[=h] oute more sermo[=n]

Thoug[=h] det[=h] be fyn and ful conclusion
Of my request, yet I wyl assaye
And right anon me thought I saye
This woful man as I haue memorye
Ful lowly entre in to an oratorye
And knelid a doun in ful humble wyse
To fore the goddesse and gan anon deuyse
His pitous quarel wit[=h] a doleful chere
Sayng right this as ye sha[=ll] here

.The compleynt of the man.




Redresse of sorow O Citherea
That wit[=h] the stremys of thy playsaunt hete
Gladest the mounte of al Cirrea
Where thou hast chosen thy paleys and sete
Whos bright beames ben wesshen and wete
In the ryuer of Elycon the welle
Haue now pyte of that I shal you telle

And not desdayne ye of your benygnyte
My mortal woo O lady myn goddesse
Of grace and bounte & mercyful pyte
Benygnely to helpe and to redresse
And thaug[=h] so be I can not wel expresse
The greuous harmes that I fele in my herte
Haue neuer yet the lesse mercy of my smerte

This is to sayne O cler heuenes light
That next the sonne sercled han your spere
Sit[=h] ye me hurte wit[=h] your dredful myght
By influence of your beames clere
And that I by your seruyse now so dere
As ye me brought in to this maladye
Be ye gracyous and shape ye remedye

For in you hoolly liet[=h] help of al this caas
And knowe best my sorow and al my peyne
For drede of det[=h], how I ne dar allas
To aren mercy ones, ne me compleyne
Now wit[=h] your fyre her hert so constrayne
Wit[=h] oute more, or I deye atte leste
That she may witte what is my request

How I no thyng in al this world desire
But for to serur fully to myn ende
That goodly freshe so womanly of chere
Wit[=h]out chaunge whyle I haue lyf & mynde
And that ye wold suche grace sende
Of my seruyse that she not disdeyne
Sithen her to serue I may not me restreyne

And sit[=h] that hope me hat[=h] yeue hardynes
To loue her best and neuer to repente
Whylis that I lyue wit[=h] al my besynes
To drede & serue, thaug[=h] daunger neuer assente
And here vpon ye knowe myn entente
How I haue vowed fully in myn mynde
To ben her man, thaug[=h] I no mercy fynde

For in my hert emprynted is so sore
Her shap her forme & al her semelynes
Her porte her chere, her godenes more & more
Her womanhed and eke her gentiles
Her trout[=h], her fait[=h] and her kyndnes
Wit[=h] alle vertues eche set in her degre
Ther is no lack, sauyng only of pyte

Her sad demenyng of wyl not variable
Of loke benygne, and rote of al plesance
And exemplayre to alle that wyl be stable
Discrete prudent of wisedom suffisance
Mirrour of witte ground of gouernance
A world of beaute compassed in her face
Whos persant loke doth thurg[=h] my hert race

And ouer this wonder secrete and true
A wel of fredome and right bounteous
And euer encrecyng in vertu new & newe
Of speche goodly, and wonder gracyous
Deuoyd of pryde, to poure not despytous
And yf that I shortly shal not feyne
Saue vpon mercy I no thing compleyne

What wonder thenne, thoug[=h] I be wit[=h] drede
Inly supprised for to axen grace
Of her that is quene of womanhede
For wel I wote in so hig[=h] a place
Hit wil not be, therfore I ouer pace
And take lowly what wo I endure
Til she of pyte me take to her cure

But one auowe plainly here I make
That whethir so be, she do me lyue or deye
I wil not gruoche, but humbly hit take
And thanke god and wilfully obeye
For by my trout[=h] my hert shal neuer reneye
For lyf ne det[=h] mercy ne daunger
Of wil and thought to be at her desire

To ben as trewe as euer was antonyus
To cleopatre whyle hym lastet[=h] bret[=h]
Or vnto thesbe yong Piramus
That was faithful found, til them deptid deth
Right so shal I til Antropos me slet[=h]
For whele or woo her faithful man be found
Vnto my last, like as my hert is bound

To loue as wel as did Achilles
Vnto his laste the fair Polixene
Or as the grete famous Hercules
For dyanyre that felte the shott kene
Right so shal I saye right as I mene
Whyle that I lyue, her bot[=h] drede and serue
For lack of mercy thoug[=h] she do me sterue

Now lady venus to whom nothing vnknowe
Is in the world hid, ne nought may be
For ther nys thing nether hye ne lowe
May be conceyled from your pryuete
Fro whom my menyng is not now secret
But wite fully that myn entent is true
And liche my trouthe now on my peyne rue

For more of grace than of presumpcion
I axe mercy, and no thing of dute
Of lowly humbles, wit[=h] oute offencion
That ye enclyne of your benygnyte
Your audience vnto my humylyte
To graunte me that to you I clepe & calle
Sum day relees yet of my peynes alle

And sit[=h] ye haue the guerdon and the mede
Of alle louers pleinly in your honde
Now of grace and pyte take ye hede
Of my distrees, that am vnder your bonde
So lowly bound, as ye wel vnderstonde
In that place where I toke first my wounde
Of pyte suffre ye my helt[=h] may be founde

That liche as she me hurte wit[=h] a sight
Right so with helth late me hur sustene
And as the stremes of her eyen bright
Whylom my hert wit[=h] woundes sharp & kene
Thurg[=h] persed haue and yet be fresh & grene
So as she me hurte, lete her me socoure
Or ellis certayn I may not long endure

For lack of speche I can say you no more
I haue mater but I can not pleyne
My witte is du[=ll] to tel al my sore
A mouth I haue, And yet for al my peyn
For want of wordes I may not now atteyn
To tel half, that dot[=h] my hert greue
Mercy abydyng, til she me list releue

But this theffect of my mater fynal
Wit[=h] det[=h] or mercy relees for to fynde
For hert body thought lyf lust and al
Wit[=h] al my reson and al my ful mynde
And fyue wittes of on assent I bynde
To her seruyse wit[=h] oute ony stryf
And make her pryncesse of my det[=h] or lyf

And now I pray of rout[=h] and eke pyte
O goodly planet, O lady venus bright
That ye your sone of his deyte
Cupide I mene that wit[=h] his dredful myght
And wit[=h] his brond that is so clere of light
Her herte so to fyre and to marke
As ye me whylem brent wit[=h] a sparke

That euenlic[=h] and with the same fyre
She may be hit, as I now brenne and melte
So that her herte be flamed wit[=h] desire
That she may knowe by feruence hou I swelte
For of pyte plainly yf she felte
The self hete that doth myn hert enbrace
I hope of rout[=h] she wi[=ll] do me grace

And ther wit[=h] al bemis as me thought
Towardes this man ful benyngely
Gan cast her eye, like as that she rought
Of his disease, and said ful goodly
Sith it is so, that thou so humbly
Wit[=h] out gruachyng our hestes liste obeye
Toward thyn help I wil anon pourueye

And eke my sone Cupyde that is so blynde
He shal be helpyng fully to performe
Your hool desire, that nothing be behynde
Ne shal be lefte, so we shal reforme
This pietous c[=o]pleynt, [that] maket[=h] the to morne
That she for whom thau sorowest most in hert
Shal thurg[=h] hur mercy relece al thy smert

Whan she scet[=h] tyme, thurg[=h] our purueaunce
Be not to hasty, but suffre althing wele
For in abydyng, thurg[=h] lowly obeyssaunce
Lyet[=h] ful redres, of al that ye now fele
And she shal be as trewe as ony stele
To you allone, by our myght and grace
Yf ye list mekely abyde a lityl space

But vnderstande ye that al her cherising
Shal be grounded vpon honeste
That no wight shal by ony compacyng
Demen amys of hur in no degre
For neyther mercy, cout[=h] ner pyte
She shal not haue ne take of the non hede
Further than longet[=h] vnto her womanhede

Be not astonyed of no wilfulnes
Ne not despeyred of this dissolucion
Late reson bridle lust by buxumnes
Wit[=h]out gruochyng or rebellyon
For ioye shal folowe al this passion
For who can suffre torment and endure
Ne may not faylle, but folowe shal his cure

For to fore alle she shal the louen best
So shal I her wit[=h]oute offencion
By Influence enspire in her brest
In honest wyse wit[=h] ful entencion
For tenclyne by clene affection
Her hert fully on the to haue routhe
Be cause I knowe that thou menest trouthe

Go now to hir where as she stant a syde
Wit[=h] humble chere, and put the in her grace
And al beforn lete hope be thy guyde
And thaug[=h] that drede wold wit[=h] the pace
Hit sittet[=h] wel, but loke that thou arace
Out of thyn hert wanhop and despeire
To her presence er thou haue repeir

And mercy first shal thy way make
And honest menyng afore do thy message
To make pyte in her herte awake
And secretnes to further thy viage
Wit[=h] humble porte to her that is so sage
Shal menes be, and I my self also
Shal the fortune, or thy tale be do

Go fort[=h] anon, and be right good of chere
For specheles nothing mayst thou spede
Be good of trust & be no thing in were
Sit[=h] I my self shal helpen in this nede
For atte lest of her goodly hede
She shal to the her audience enclyne
And lowe the to her til thou thy tale fyne

For wel thou wost yf I shal not feyne
Wit[=h]oute speche thou maist no mercy haue
For who that wil of his pryue peyne
Fully be cured his lyf to helpe and saue
He must mekely out of his hert graue
Discure his wound and shewe hit his leche
Or ellis deye for defaute of speche

For he that is in myschief reklees
To seche help I holde hym a wrecche
And she ne may thyn hert bryng in pees
But yf thy compleynt to hir hert strecche
Woldest thou be cured & wilt no salue fecche
Hit wil not be, for no wight may atteyne
To come to blys, yf he list lyue in peyne

Therfore attones go fort[=h] in humble wyse
To fore thy lady and lowly knele a doun
And in al trouthe thy wordes so deuyse
That she on the haue compassion
For she that is of so hye renoun
In al vertues as quene and souerayn
Of womanhed shal rue on thy payn

And whan the goddes this lesson had told
Aboute me so I gan behold
Rig[=h]t so a stoned stode in a traunce
To se the maner and contenance
And al the chere of this woful man
That was of hue dedely pale and wan
Wit[=h] drede supprised in his owne thought

Makyng chere as thaug[=h] he rought nought
Of lyf ne det[=h] ne what so hym betyde
So moche fere he had on euery side
To put hym fort[=h] to tel his peyne
Vnto his lady, other to compleyne
What woo he felt torment or disese
What dedely sorow his hert dide sese
For cout[=h] of whiche his wo as I endite
My penne I fele quaken as I wryte
Of hym I had so grete compassion
For to reherce his weymentacion
That vnnethe, thoug[=h] I wit[=h] my self stryue
I want connyng his peynes to discryue
Allas to whom shal I for help calle
Not to the muses for cause they ben alle
Help of right in Ioye and not in woo
And in matiers that they delite also
Wherfore they nyl as now directe my style
Nor me enspiren Alas the hard whyle
I can no further but to the siphon
And to her suster to calle help vpon
That be goddesses of torment and peyne
Nowe lete your teris in to myn Inke reyne

Wit[=h] woful wordes my paper for to blotte
This woful mater not to peynt, but spotte
To tel the maner of this dredeful man
Vpon his complaynt whan he first began
To tel his lady whan he gan declare
His hid sorowis, and his euel fare
That at his herte constreyned so sore
Theffect of whiche was this wit[=h]oute more

Pryncesse of yougt[=h] & flour of gentilesse
Ensample of vertu ground of curtesye
Of beaute rote quene and eke maistres
To alle women how they shal hem gye
And sot[=h]fast mirrour texemplifye
The right way of port and of womanhede
What I shal saye, of mercy take ye hede
Besechyng first vnto your hye nobles
Wit[=h] quakyng hert of my Inward drede
Of grace and pyte & not of right wysnes
Of verrey cout[=h]e to help in this nede
This is to say O wel of goodlyhede
That I ne rekke thaug[=h] ye do me deye
So ye list first to heven what I seye

The dredeful stroke the gret force and might
Of god cupide that noman may rebelle
So inwardly thurg[=h] out myn hert right
Y perced hat[=h] that I ne may councele
Myn hid wound ne I ne may apele
Vnto no gretter, this mighty god so faste
You to serue hat[=h] me bound vnto my laste

That hert and a[=ll] wit[=h] out stryf ar yolde
For lyf or det[=h] to your seruyse allone
Right as the goddesse myghty venus wolde
To for her mekely whan I made my mone
She me constrayned wit[=h]oute chaunge anone
To your seruyse and neuer for to fayne
Wherso euer ye list to do me ease or payne

So that I can no thing but mercy crye
Of you my lady, and chaunge for no newe
That ye list godely to fore er that I dye
Of verray couthe vpon my paynes rue
For by my trouthe, and ye my peynes knewe
What is the cause of myne aduersite
On myn disese ye wolde haue pyte

For vnto you trewe and eke secre
I wil be founde to serue as I best can
And therwit[=h] al as lowly in eche degre
To you be allone as euer yet was man
Vnto his lady from the tyme I began
And shal so fort[=h] wit[=h]outen ony sleut[=h]
Whylis that I lyue, by god & by my trout[=h]

For leuer I had to deyen sodenly
Than you offende in any maner wyse
And suffre paynes inward priuely
Than my seruyse as now ye shold dispyse
For I right neught wil axe in no wyse
But for your seruaunt ye wold me accepte
And whan I trespace, goodly me correcte

And for to graunte of mercy the prayer
Only of grace and womanly pyte
From day to day that I myght leve
You for to plese, and therwit[=h] al that ye
Whan I do mys, list for to teche me
In your seruyse hou that I may amende
From hensfort[=h] and neuer you offende

For vnto me it doth ynow[=h] suffyse
That for your man ye wold me resseyue
Fully to ben as you lyst deuyse
And as ferforth as my wittes can conceyue
And therwith al liche as ye preue
That I be true, to guerdone me of grace
Or ellis to punysshe after my trespace

And yf so be that I may not atteyne
Vnto your mercy, yet graunte at the leste
In your seruyse for al my wo and peyne
That I may deyen after my beheste
This is al and som the fyn of my request
Outher with mercy your seruaunt to saue
Or mercyles that I may be begraue

And whan this benygne of her entent true
Conceyued hat[=h] the compleynt of this man
Right as the fresh rody Rose newe
Of her colour to wexen she began
Her blood astoned so from her herte ran
In to her face of verray femynyte
Thurgh honest drede abasshed was she

And humbly she began her eyen caste
Towardes hym of hir benygnyte
So that no word by her lippes past
For hast nor drede mercy ne pyte
For so demened she was in honeste
That vnaduysed no thing fro her stert
So moche of reson was compassed in her hert

Til atte last of whiche she did abreyd
Whan she is trouthe and menyng did fele
And vnto hym ful goodly spack and seyd
Of your behest and your menyng wele
And your seruyse so fait[=h]ful euerydele
Whiche vnto me so lowly now ye offre
Wit[=h] al my herte, I thanke you of your profre

That for so moche your entent is sette
Only in vertu y bridled vnder drede
Ye must of right nedis face the bet
Of your request, and the better spede
But as for me I may of womanhede
No further graunte to you in myn entente
Than as my lady venus wil assente

Wherfore as venus list this mater to gye

Til her liste, sette bothe our hertes in rest

For she is that byndet[=h] and can constreyn

And can relece louers of her peyn

Of one acorde vnto your lyues ende

To meue or styre to brynge in doublenes
Vpon your trout[=h] to gyuen a bataylle
Lete not your corage ne your force faylle
Nor none assaultes you flitten or remeue
For vnassayed no man may trout[=h] preue

For whyte is whitter yf it be set by black
And swete is swetter after bitternes
And falshed euer is dryue and put a back
Where trouthe is roted wit[=h] doblenes
Wit[=h]out preue ther may be no sekernes
Of loue or hate and therfore of you two
Shal loue be more, for hit was bought with woo

And euery thing is had more in deynte
And more of pris whan it is dere bought
And eke loue stondeth more in sewrte
Whan it is to fore with payne woo & thought
Conquerd was first whan hit was sought
And euery conquest hath his excellence
In his poursute as it fyndeth resistence

And so to you more sote and agreable
Shal loue be found I do you plainly assure
Wit[=h]out grucchyng that ye were suffrable
So lowe so meke paciently to endure
That al attones I shal do now my cure
For now and euer your hertis so to bynde

Now in this mater what shold I lenger dwelle
Come ye attones and do as I haue said
And first my doughter that ar of bounte welle
In hert and thought be glad & wel apayd
To done hym grace that shal & hath obeyd
Your lustes euer, and I wil for his sake
Of trouth to you be bounde and vndertake

And so fort[=h] wit[=h]in presence as they stand
To fore the goddes this fair and wele
Her humble seruant toke goodly by the hond
As he to fore her, mekely did knele
And kyssed hym after fulfillyng eueridele
From poynt to poynt in ful thryfty wyse
As ye to forn haue venus herd deuyse

Thus is this man to ioye and al plesance
From heuynes and from his peynes olde
Ful reconcyled, and hat[=h] ful suffisance
Of her that euer ment wel, and wold
That in good fait[=h] and I tel shold
The inward mirthes did her hertis brace
For al my lyf to telle, it were to lityl space

For he hat[=h] wonne hir that he louet[=h] best
And she to grace hat[=h] take hym of pyte
And thus her hertes ben bot[=h] set in rest
Wit[=h]oute chaunge or mutabilite
And venus hat[=h] of her benygnyte
Confermed al what shal I lenger tary
These tweyne in one and neuer to vary

That for the ioye in the temple aboute
Of this acorde by grete solempnyte
Was laude and honour within & wit[=h]oute
Yeue to venus, and to the deyte
Of god cupide, so that Caliope
And al her sustren in her armonye
Soon with songes the goddes did magnifye

And al attones with notes loud & sharp
They did her honour and her reuerence
And Orpheus among them with his harp
Gan strynges touche with his diligence
And Amphion that hath suche excellence
Of musyke ay dyde his besynes
To plese and queme venus the goddesse

Only for cause of the affinyte
Betwix these two not lusty to disseuere
And euery louer of lowe and hye degre
Gan venus pray fro thens fort[=h] and euer
That hool of them the loue may [per]seuere
Wit[=h]outen ende in suche wyse as they gonne
And more encrece that hit of hard was wonne

And the goddes heryng this request
As she that knewe the clene entencion
Of bothe them tweyne made a bihest
Perpetuelly by confirmacion
Whylis they lyue of one affection
They shal endure ther is no more to sayne
That neyther shal haue mater to complayne

So ferfurt[=h] euermore in our eternal see
The goddes haue in our presence

And hooly concluded by her Influence

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
