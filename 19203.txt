Rapidity in learning to read depends upon the quickness with which the
child's attention shall be drawn to the substance by which the process
is made more or less an unconscious one. The method of this book's
production has been as follows: The story was first related to pupils
from seven to nine years of age, in the best form possible. Some days
later, reproductions, both oral and written, were called for. These
reproductions (many hundred in number) formed the material for most
careful study as to essential elements of plot, salient points of
interest, and =especially the words and forms of expressions used by
children=. By this means the story has been reconstructed. =Portions
over which the children love to linger are brought out to the fullest
extent.= Their words and forms of language, within the limits of
grammatical usage, =are followed scrupulously=. =Less than seven hundred
and fifty words=, all of the commonest use among children, are used in
the entire series.

Without attempting to formulate any principles or a philosophy of
children's interests, the author has simply sought =to draw the material
from the child itself=.

These stories, in typewritten and mimeograph form, were used in the
schools of Santa Rosa, Cal., for many months, and in their present form
are the product of much revision.

"_It may be safely said that in these stories there is a drawing power
for the child that is assurance that a resonant chord in the child
nature has been struck._"--FREDERICK BURK, Clark Univ.

[Sidenote: With the Editor]

As we go to press there is an uncertain feeling resulting from the
departure of our cruiser for Cuban waters. It may provoke a crisis, or
it may lead to a better knowledge of the true attitude of the
administration toward Spain.

Cuba continues to furnish us with its share of current history; the news
is no more encouraging than that of previous weeks, however.

In the East the situation has not materially changed. It continues
interesting--so interesting that this subject is uppermost in the minds
of the civilized world. While any day may witness the peaceful
settlement of the whole trouble, it is by no means certain but that
selfish motives of one of the Great Powers may, at any minute, cause a
general European war.

England's attention is divided between China and Egypt. The Indian and
Chinese questions bid fair to be merged, as there are indications that
England's attitude toward China is not an unselfish one.

In France the Dreyfus clamor has grown to a disturbance, the disturbance
to riot;--what next?

The short sketch of the life of Gladstone which will be published in
next week's number should interest all of our readers. The "Grand Old
Man" is undoubtedly the grandest figure in the history of the century
now closing, and his admirers are to be found in every part of the
world--many in our own country, where self-achieved greatness is by no
means uncommon. His has been a life of constant, unremitted labor in the
advancement of the interests of his fellow-men. No minute in his long
life seems to have been wasted, and to-day, when nearly ninety years of
age, he continues to labor to the utmost of his remaining strength.

Our Naturalist has already received enough suggestions for his projected
book to enable him to write a library, we think, but he says that he is
quite in earnest in wanting to hear from many thousand boys and girls on
this subject. His purpose is apparently to make a book which shall be
found just right by all.

A batch of letters comes in from Baltimore, and the subjects are so
varied and interesting that we give them in outline.

Jane H. wants to know about the mongoose: what kind of snakes it kills;
about sun-spots and their influence on the seasons.

C. F. N. about the sky, sun, moon, and stars.

Philip H. H. about bees and crabs.

Edwin St. J. G. about horses, especially those with long manes and
tails.

Sidney G. about wild animals, lions; also snakes and unfamiliar plants.

Claude E. H. about Mother Carey's chickens. He writes that his uncle
shot one while crossing the ocean.

Murray W. T. about birds and plants, "with pictures."

Howell G. about the quail, woodpecker, and other birds. (We wonder if he
has seen Grant's book on birds, or "Bird Neighbors"?)

James M. about sea-lions and wild animals; also about cats and domestic
animals.

Denison F. about ant-eaters, lions, and whales.

Tom T. about the horse, dog, and python.

You can see by the above letters--and this was but part of one mail--how
many things our young people want to know about, and what a task
"Naturalist" has taken upon himself.

From Sterling, Ill., comes a request from a number of boys and girls for
a book about wild animals and how they live. (Ingersoll's "Wild
Neighbors" is just such a book.)

E. C., of Brookline, writes a very suggestive letter. A few of his wants
are as follows: chapters on garden-grubs, and insects injurious to
vegetation; caterpillars, together with pictures of the butterflies that
come from them; birds' nests; colored pictures of beetles, fossils,
shells, etc. He says in conclusion: "Even with things to see, you often
need to be shown how to look."

In this he is right, for we miss many beautiful things in this world
because we do not know "how to look."

We wish to acknowledge with pleasure the well-written letters from Point
Grammar School, Gloucester, Mass., from "Brenda P. S.," "Alberta S.
M.," "Mary S. E.," and "Susan M."

Current History

The proposed annexation of the Hawaiian islands is still being actively
discussed in the Senate.

The friends of the bill are doing their best to present every argument
for it in the most convincing way.

Senator Morgan, however, went a little too far the other day in his zeal
in its behalf. He declared that ex-President Cleveland wanted the
islands to be annexed to the United States, but that he thought the
ex-Queen ought first to be restored to the throne and given an
opportunity to let the islands be acquired by purchase.

Mr. Cleveland promptly denied this statement. "I can hardly believe Mr.
Morgan made the assertions imputed to him," he said in an interview. "He
knew perfectly well that I have been utterly and constantly opposed to
Hawaiian annexation. The first thing I did after my inauguration, in
March, 1893, was to recall from the Senate an annexation treaty then
pending before that body. I regard the annexation of these islands as a
complete departure from our national mission. I did not suppose that
there was any person in public life that had any doubt as to my position
in this matter.

"Aside from any question of annexation, and without harboring any
design of restoring the Hawaiian monarchy, I investigated the relation
of our representatives to its overthrow. This investigation satisfied me
that our interference in the matter was disgraceful and wrong, and I
would gladly, for the sake of our national honor and fair fame, have
repaired that wrong; only this, and nothing more."

These remarks are important, as they refer back to the very beginning of
the troubles in Hawaii which led to the present plan of making the
islands a part of the United States.

In saying that the annexation of the islands would be a "complete
departure from our national mission," Mr. Cleveland meant that it was
the policy of our Government not to go outside of America to acquire
territory, but to let other nations alone just as we ourselves wish to
be let alone.

This policy is very different from that of England, for example, who has
for many years been reaching out to add to her already vast possessions.
In other words, our plan is opposed to what is known as the "policy of
grab."

By speaking of "our interference" in the Hawaiian revolution as
"disgraceful," Mr. Cleveland means that the revolution was not only
largely planned by American residents on the islands, but that American
marines were called from the harbor of Honolulu to the government
building to assist the revolutionists, or, as the revolutionists
themselves declare, to protect American interests on the islands.

Now that the question of annexation is before the country, a prominent
advocate for each side has appeared.

We referred last week to the visit here of the President of the Hawaiian
republic, Mr. Sanford B. Dole. He has recently stated his side of the
matter, in an interview.

And the deposed Hawaiian Queen Liliuokalani, or "ex-Queen," as she is
called, has presented her views in the form of a book, giving an account
of her whole life.

Let us first see what Liliuokalani has to say.

In the first part of the book she tells us how she was brought up. It is
astonishing to read that, though she was the daughter of one of the
chiefs of the island, she was sent, very shortly after birth, to the
house of another chief, named Paki, where there was only one daughter,
Bernice, and made a member of his family.

This chief was married to a granddaughter of one of the Hawaiian kings,
Kamehameha I., so the adopted girl was considered a member of the royal
family.

Here is the account Liliuokalani herself gives of her adoption:

"I knew no other father or mother than my foster-parents, no other
sister than Bernice. I used to climb up on the knees of Paki, put my
arms around his neck, kiss him, and he caressed me as a father would his
child; while, on the contrary, when I met my own parents, it was with
perhaps more of interest, yet always with the demeanor I would have
shown to any strangers who noticed me.

"My own father and mother had other children, ten in all, the most of
them being adopted into other chiefs' families; and although I knew that
these were my own brothers and sisters, yet we met throughout my
younger life as though we had not known our common parentage.

"This was, and indeed is, in accordance with Hawaiian customs. It is not
easy to explain its origin to those alien to our national life, but it
seems perfectly natural to us.

"As intelligible a reason as can be given is that this alliance by
adoption cemented the ties of friendship between the chiefs. It spread
to the common people, and it has doubtless fostered a community of
interest and harmony."

It is odd to think of a princess, even of an Hawaiian princess, as being
educated, like other girls, in a school. But the school she attended was
for those pupils only who had some claim on the succession to the
throne.

Near-by, however, there was another school, where some of the children
of American residents were educated. Among these was John O. Dominis,
the son of a sea-captain of Italian descent, and whose mother was a
Boston woman.

Young Dominis made the acquaintance of the future Queen by climbing over
the wall and talking to the pupils of the Royal School, as it was
called.

A number of years later, in 1862, Liliuokalani became his wife.

This long name, by the way, was not given her until 1877, when the heir
to the throne died, and she became the next in succession to the
reigning King Kalakaua.

This King may be said to have helped to cause the revolution that made
Hawaii a republic. In 1887 he was persuaded by the white residents,
largely Americans or the sons of Americans, to give the country a new
constitution that took away a great deal of his power.

"It may be asked," the Queen writes, "Why did the King give them his
signature? I answer without hesitation, because he had discovered
traitors among his most trusted friends, and knew not in whom he could
trust; and because he had every assurance, short of actual
demonstration, that the conspirators were ripe for revolution, and had
taken measures to have him assassinated if he refused.

"His movements of late had been watched, and his steps dogged, as though
he had been a fugitive from justice. Whenever he attempted to go out in
the evening, either to call at the hotel or visit any one of his
friends' houses, he was conscious of the presence of enemies who were
following stealthily on his track.

"But, happily, Providence watched over him, and thus he was guarded from
personal harm.

"He signed that constitution under absolute compulsion. Details of the
conspiracy have come to me since from sources upon which I can rely,
which lead to the conviction that but for the repugnance or timidity of
one of the executive committee, since risen very high in the counsels of
the so-called republic, he would have been assassinated.

"Then they had planned for the immediate abrogation of the monarchy, the
declaration of a republic, and a proposal for annexation to be made to
the United States.

"The constitution of the republic was actually framed and agreed upon,
but the plot was not fully carried out--more moderate counsels
prevailed.

"They therefore took the very constitution of which I have spoken, the
one which had been drafted for a republic, hastily rewrote it so as to
answer their ends, and forced Kalakaua to affix thereto his official
signature."

In 1891 Kalakaua died and Liliuokalani succeeded him. Not long afterward
she determined to try to get back the power for the monarchy that had
been taken away.

This soon caused the revolution. Her enemies brought a number of charges
against her, and to the chief of these she replies in her book.

Though comparatively few in number, her enemies had so much power that
they were able to overturn the Government with little difficulty.

Then they appealed to President Cleveland, asking that the islands be
annexed.

As the President gave them no encouragement, they continued to govern
Hawaii as a republic.

In 1895 an effort was made to place Liliuokalani again on the throne. It
failed, and for a time the ex-Queen was held as a prisoner.

After her release she came to this country to try to secure the aid of
our Government.

The Government, however, did not interfere.

Among our legislators and in our newspapers a great deal of sympathy was
expressed for the revolutionists and a great deal said in favor of
annexation.

At last the republic of Hawaii formally requested that it be made a part
of the United States. This brought the matter before Congress, where,
as we have said, it is now being carefully considered.

In her book, Liliuokalani makes this strong appeal to the people of the
United States not to take sides with those who have driven her from her
throne:

"O honest Americans, as Christians, hear me for my downtrodden people!
Their form of government is as dear to them as yours is precious to you.
Quite as warmly as you love your country, do they love theirs. With all
your goodly possessions, covering a territory so immense that there yet
remain parts unexplored, possessing islands that, although near at hand,
had to be neutral ground in time of war, do not covet the little
vineyard of Naboth's, so far from your shores, lest the punishment of
Ahab fall upon you, if not in your day, in that of your children, for
'be not deceived, God is not mocked.' The people to whom your fathers
told of the living God, and taught to call 'Father,' and whom the sons
now seek to despoil and destroy, are crying aloud to Him in their time
of trouble, and He will keep His promise, and will listen to the voices
of His Hawaiian children lamenting for their homes."

In view of all that Liliuokalani has to say, the recent interview with
President Dole is particularly interesting.

After explaining that no special powers had been granted him on his
present mission by the Hawaiian Senate, the President declared it was
the belief of the friends of annexation that if the recent amendment of
Senator Bacon, to let the question be decided by a vote of the Hawaiian
citizens, had been accepted, the vote would be in favor of the treaty.

President Dole said that, in case of annexation, Hawaii had in view no
radical changes in legislation.

"The treaty provides," he said, "for the appointment by the President of
the United States of a commission authorized to formulate and recommend
to Congress the legislation and forms of government for Hawaii.

"The matter of franchise is now specifically provided for by our laws.
For those who elect Senators there is a property and educational
qualification; for those who elect Representatives an educational
qualification. All electors must take an oath of allegiance to the
present Government and renounce allegiance to monarchy.

"There is a strong sentiment on the island against allowing Chinese and
Japanese to become citizens. There are cases where these races have
acquired the ballot, but they are very few, and the sentiment is adverse
to their becoming citizens.

"The natives are all citizens, and would have the right of franchise.
Under the regulations now governing the franchise, about 4,000 votes
were cast in the election of 1894, and about 3,000 at the more recent
election."

President Dole made a glowing picture of the benefits that this country
would receive from annexation. It would greatly encourage commerce
between the United States and Hawaii by making the trade absolutely
free, and it would open up to Americans a great many industries, the
chief among them being coffee-growing.

It would also vastly improve the condition of the islands themselves.

In case annexation is rejected by our Government, President Dole says
the Hawaiian Government will continue much as it is at present.

Whatever happens, there is slight prospect that Liliuokalani will be
restored to her throne.

       *       *       *       *       *

At last accounts, Havana was in a state of peace. But it was feared that
this peace would not last, and an outbreak against the Americans was
expected.

Only the other day Representative Amos Cummings, of New York, made a
fierce speech attacking the Spanish authorities and urging our
Government to go to war with Spain and help to free Cuba. He compared
the condition of Cuba to-day with the condition of the American colonies
at the time of the Revolution.

Then, too, a great meeting was recently held in Boston to uphold Cuba's
cause, and the feeling in favor of the Cubans has been strongly shown
throughout the United States.

But the Cuban insurgents are suspicious of Americans, because our
Government has done nothing to help them.

If the Government did do anything to assist the Cuban cause, we should
probably have a war on our hands in a very short time.

In preparation for further trouble in Havana, General Blanco is said to
have gathered a large body of troops in order to crush it at once.

General Blanco, however, decided not to remain in Havana, but to go
east and take charge of the campaign against the insurgents.

On the other hand, it is reported that many of the troops left Havana a
few days after the riots, and that the only signs of the disturbance
were the squads of soldiers left to guard two of the newspaper offices
that had been attacked.

Some of these troops, it is reported, have been sent to Santiago de
Cuba, where the insurgents have been very active of late.

It was rumored recently that the seat of the Cuban Government, near
Cubitas, had fallen into the hands of the Spanish.

This rumor, however, is believed to be false. Still, the Spaniards have
probably been doing some good fighting in this neighborhood.

The Cuban President and his Cabinet are not likely to be molested, as
they are concealed in remote and inaccessible mountain-passes.

A good deal of newspaper talk has been created by the acceptance of
General Blanco's Government by Gen. Juan Masso, cousin of President
Bartolome Masso, and his brigade, and by the surrender of five private
soldiers belonging to the command of Gen. Maximo Gomez, the insurgent
commander-in-chief.

These soldiers declare that General Gomez ordered Captain Nestor Alvarez
to be shot for attempting to persuade insurgent soldiers to accept
autonomy. They have asked permission to form a guerilla force to avenge
the captain's death.

In various parts of the island the Cubans have been doing a great deal
of damage to property, but it is impossible to know accurately just
what they are gaining by their devastations. The news sent from the
Cuban and the Spanish camps does not agree by any means.

Both sides declare that they are making progress.

There is no doubt, however, that though the Cubans had lost hope of
receiving help from the United States this winter, they have not lost
courage.

At present they are busily engaged in transporting supplies into the
centre of the island, and they propose to continue the campaign through
the wet season.

The Spaniards maintain that the insurgents are at the end of their
resources, that very misleading reports of the war are sent to this
country, and that the Cuban Junta in New York gives information that
cannot be relied upon to the papers.

The Spanish minister has gone so far as to defy Tomas Estrada Palma, who
is at the head of the Junta, to mention five Cuban generals who are now
in good standing.

He evidently hopes in this way to discredit the information sent out by
the Junta.

On the other hand, the Junta discredits the reports sent out by the
Spaniards. In the case of Gen. Juan Masso, for example, it says that
several months before his surrender Masso had been degraded from the
command, and that his so-called "brigade" consisted only of a few
personal followers; so his acceptance of autonomy did not by any means
indicate that the insurgents were giving up the cause of Free Cuba.

The excitement in France over the case of Captain Dreyfus, instead of
subsiding, has grown even more serious.

For several days the students have paraded the streets in small groups,
uttering cries against Zola and the Jews, and have been dispersed by the
police.

It is said also that cries of "Long live the Emperor" have been heard.

This suggests that the excitement may affect the Government, after all,
in spite of its apparent security in recent years.

In Paris this seems to be a very easy thing to do. More than once the
Government has been overturned by the mob.

In spite of their bitter experiences, the French people of to-day are
very like the French people of a little more than a hundred years ago.

But the French people of a hundred years ago were very badly governed
and had terrible grievances.

At present, the French are well governed by rulers of their own
choosing.

It is very likely that those who cried out for the Emperor were either
jokers, or people eager to add to the excitement, or else paid agents of
the Imperial party, which still hopes to restore the descendants of the
first Napoleon to the throne of France.

So far, the mob has accomplished nothing, and the Government has stood
firm.

In the Chamber of Deputies, however, the discussion of the Dreyfus case
has led to very serious complications.

One of the members, ex-Minister Cavaignac, declared that a report
existed, written by Captain Lebrun-Renaud, of the French army, which
gave an account of a confession of guilt made by Captain Dreyfus.
Monsieur Cavaignac blamed the Government for keeping silent about this
confession, on the ground that by its silence it had practically led to
a reopening of the case. If the Government would declare, he said, that
the publication of the confession would involve some foreign Power, this
would end further discussion of the matter. Otherwise, the whole case
ought to be made public.

Premier Meline replied that such a confession existed, but the
Government had decided not to publish it, as it would change the
character of a case that had already been settled by competent judges.
There was, besides, he acknowledged, another cause for keeping silence,
the very cause that had made the trial secret. This was not "excessively
great," but it was customary to conduct all such trials in secrecy, and
the custom was not to be violated in this instance.

The Premier then criticised the newspapers that had taken sides with
Dreyfus, and added that the Government had done right in calling Zola to
account for insulting the army.

The President of the Chamber, Monsieur Brisson, then leaped to his feet
and implored the legislators not to make a sensation while the streets
outside were in a turmoil.

Premier Meline replied that the Government would quell the turmoil in
the streets, and that those men should be blamed for the scandal who had
started it. Then he condemned the socialistic newspapers for their
attacks on the Government.

The socialistic newspapers are those papers that advocate the doctrine
of Socialism, which may be said to have grown out of the French
Revolution.

Socialism is founded on the theory that all rights and privileges and
benefits should be shared equally by all the members of the community,
and that the wealth of the world should be in the hands of the
Government, which should have the power of distributing it. The
citizens, instead of competing with one another, as they do now, should
work together for the general good and be paid alike.

Many people believe that though this doctrine sounds very
Christian-like, it would not work. The industrious would get no more for
their labor than the idle. So the idle would become more idle, and the
industrious would lose all incentive to do their best.

At any rate, Socialism has made great progress in France, and it is
greatly feared there by its enemies. Its friends, on the contrary, think
that it is going to make the world very much better than it is at
present.

The friends of Socialism in the Chamber of Deputies became greatly
excited by Premier Meline's censure of their papers. The excitement
reached a climax when one member accused another of being a scoundrel
and a coward, and several fights took place. Even the people in the
galleries fought among themselves, and hurled abuse down at the members.

The scene was not unlike one of those disgraceful scenes that took place
in the Reichsrath of Austria a few weeks ago.

The reporters were then asked to leave, and the rest of the session was
conducted in secret. On entering the corridors the reporters found them
crowded with soldiers who had been called out at the beginning of the
trouble in case they should be needed.

Fortunately, their interference was not required.

Think of what the excitement is likely to be when Zola is brought to
trial!

[Illustration: A VEILED EGYPTIAN BEAUTY.]

There has been so much secrecy about the Egyptian troubles that it is
not easy to explain England's present activity on the Nile.

The last report says that Colonel Parsons, on his way to take Kassaba
from the Italians, met King Menelik. The King was very angry because the
town had been surrendered to the Egyptians. He claimed that Kassaba
belonged to his territory, and he was then engaged in organizing an army
to fight for what he considered his right.

The situation in Egypt is further complicated by the report that General
Kitchener's Soudanese troops, in whose fighting qualities he has had
great confidence, have shown signs of dissatisfaction.

If they were to rebel against England's authority at this time, the
consequence might be very serious.

       *       *       *       *       *

Just now England is under such terrible expense that it is thought that
her present exchequer is in danger of exhaustion.

She is sending forces to the Nile to settle the Egyptian troubles there,
and she has the uprisings on the Indian frontier, which are likely to
cause her considerable expense.

Then, too, there is that vast loan which she has offered to China and
which is creating a sensation among the European Powers.

       *       *       *       *       *

England has taken a firm position with regard to the occupation of
Kiao-Chou by Germany and the seizure of Port Arthur by the Russians.

She has openly sent two war-ships to each of these ports.

This does not mean that she wishes to provoke war. It is intended
probably as a hint to Germany and Russia that if they go too far she is
ready to fight.

Germany, however, has repeated that Kiao-Chou is to be a free port, and
this statement is being echoed with satisfaction by the English press.

Nevertheless, the English papers show an astonishingly warlike spirit,
and the English people are said to be delighted by the pluck and force
which Lord Salisbury has shown in this crisis.

During the past few years Lord Salisbury has been accused of a
willingness to make almost any concession to avoid dragging England into
a war.

       *       *       *       *       *

A writer in the New York _Sun_ has lately published a very able and
interesting article on the relation of the United States to the present
crisis in the East.

In this country we have been so absorbed in watching the rivalry between
the European Powers over China that we have given very little thought to
its effect on ourselves.

The writer in _The Sun_ shows that it may affect us very seriously.

He does not believe that there is any immediate danger of a war as a
result of the seizure of Kiao-Chou, and he adds that the present
excitement may be "for the purpose of finding out just what the
pretensions of the various Powers are with regard to China."

"The attitude of Great Britain," he writes, "is one requiring close
examination, because of the magnitude and far-reaching character of her
demands on China. Briefly stated, they are:

"First, that China shall accept a loan guaranteed by Great Britain;
secondly, that as security the customs administration shall be placed
under her agents, with a contingent control of the _likin_ or internal
customs; thirdly, the right to push the Burmese railways at once into
Yunnan and Sechuen; and, fourthly, that no cessions of territory shall
be made to any other power south of the Yang-tse-kiang."

The immense importance of these demands the writer very clearly
explains.

[Illustration: WESTERN GATE, PEKIN, CHINA.]

If England were to grant China the enormous loan that she needs to pay
the war indemnity to Japan, she would secure "a controlling voice in
all future financial transactions which the Chinese Government might
wish or be forced to undertake."

If China agreed to the second proposition, England could manage the
customs in such a way as to "attract the vast bulk of the internal trade
of China to herself."

He writes further:

"The third and fourth demands hang together, but have to be treated
separately. The concession to Great Britain of the unrestricted right to
construct railways from Burmah into the southwestern provinces of China
would have the effect of turning them into commercial tributaries of
Great Britain.

"A railway connecting Rangoon in Burmah by way of Bhamo with Ichang at
the head of navigation on the Yang-tse-kiang would act as a suction pipe
to draw away to the port of Rangoon the trade of the most prosperous and
flourishing parts of China, and give products taking that route the
advantage of many days in point of time and of distance in the race for
the European markets. By just so much trade as might take the British
route through Burmah, would the potential trade of other Powers, with no
other but all sea routes from the coast at their command, be diminished.

"The advantage British manufactures would have for entry and
distribution into the vast and populous regions which the British
Government proposes to penetrate by means of railways constructed by
British capital, and affording employment to British labor and shipping,
are too obvious to need enlarging upon.

"A glance at the map will show that the better half of China proper,
territorially and commercially, would, by the concession of the third
and fourth of England's demands, be placed under her practical control."

The writer believes that the fourth demand is aimed at stopping the
advance of the French in China beyond Tonquin.

Now comes the point of his article most interesting to us as Americans.

How are our interests in China to be affected by the European
encroachments there?

They would be greatly injured, the writer points out, if any European
Power were to secure such control in China that our Chinese trade would
be restricted.

Consequently, our interests are on the side of China and of Japan, for
the Japanese must now be looking with astonishment and alarm at the
possible partition by European Powers of the nation which she herself
conquered only a short time ago.

"It cannot possibly be for the advantage of this country to aid in
establishing the financial and commercial, with the eventual political,
predominance of any one country in China."

And further:

"The protestations in the British press and by prominent members of the
British Government, that England does not ask for herself any privileges
that she is not willing to see extended to all other nations, is fine
political rhetoric, but one has only to point to India, and ask how much
Great Britain's control and administration of that country, with its
vast population, have contributed to the general commerce and wealth of
the world."

In the Reichstag the other day, Baron von Buelow made an important
announcement regarding the killing of the German missionaries in China
that led to the German occupancy of Kiao-Chou.

The negotiations between Germany and China over the affair, he said,
were now practically concluded, and with very satisfactory results.

The Governor of Shan-Tung had been removed and would be forever barred
from holding another public office.

Six officials, accused by Germany of taking part in the murders, had
also been degraded and punished, and the actual perpetrators of the
crimes would be treated as they deserved.

China had promised to pay heavy damages for the injury done to the
mission, and would, moreover, provide for the erection of three
churches, each marked with a tablet to indicate that they were under the
protection of the Emperor.

China would also furnish the money necessary for the erection of seven
residences for the Catholic prefecture of Tsao-Chou-Fu.

The Chinese Government finally agreed to issue a special Imperial edict
to insure the future protection of the German missions.

       *       *       *       *       *

Major Williams, who was sent to London by the Treasury Department to
inquire into the means for enforcing the new sealskin exclusion act, has
acknowledged that his inquiries have discouraged him. He believes it
will be impossible for the Government to enforce the law in its present
form. Comparatively few of the sealskins can be identified after they
have passed through the hands of the wholesale and the retail dealers.

So it looks as if the Government would have to find some other way to
protect the seals from threatened extinction.

The observations of the eclipse of the sun on the 22d of January, taken
at Talni, India, are said to have been completely successful.

The astronomers who had gone to Talni from Great Britain to represent
the British Astronomical Association, and from the Lick Observatory at
San Francisco, succeeded in taking some excellent photographs.

While the eclipse was complete, the light is said to have equalled that
of the full moon.

Wherever observations were made, the results are reported to have been
satisfactory.

During the eclipse, Venus, Mars, and Mercury were clearly seen.

The report that Mr. Gladstone is in very feeble health has been
confirmed.

It looks now as if one of the greatest careers in the whole history of
England would soon be ended.

Mr. Gladstone, however, has always had such remarkable vitality that his
admirers all over the world hope that he will be spared a few years
longer.

Still, there can be no doubt that his work is over. And what wonderful
work it has been!

As Mr. Gladstone was born in Liverpool on the 29th of December, 1809, he
is now in his eighty-ninth year.

Since 1894, when his failing eyesight forced him to leave public life,
he has lived very quietly at his home in Hawarden.

But he has continued to take an active interest in public affairs, and
he has devoted himself to the studies in which he has had a life-long
interest. On several occasions, too, he has spoken out on subjects of
grave importance, showing his old-time vigor and courage.

His death would be a loss not only to England, but to the world at
large.

He has always taken a deep interest in the American Government and in
the American people.

In this country, "the Grand Old Man," as Mr. Gladstone has long been
called, is regarded with great admiration and affection.

An account of Mr. Gladstone's career will be published in a later number
of THE GREAT ROUND WORLD.

It will show why he is so highly honored as a statesman, a writer, and
as a friend of his fellow-men.

       *       *       *       *       *

Many readers of THE GREAT ROUND WORLD doubtless remarked the great
strike that took place in Chicago more than three years ago, and the
share in it of Debs, the political agitator, which led to his
imprisonment.

Within the past few months Debs has been busily engaged in making plans
to found a colony for unemployed men and women, where they will be
given opportunities of earning a living.

He has lately purchased 30,000 acres of land in Tennessee for this
purpose.

It will be interesting to watch the outcome of this experiment.

As a rule, experiments of this kind are not successful.

It is to be hoped that this new undertaking will prove to be an
exception.

Our workingmen certainly need help. All over the world they are
complaining, and many people believe that, unless their condition is
improved, they will resort to violence against the rich.

So all efforts in their behalf are particularly interesting at this
time.

It is announced that the Emperor of Germany, who is fond of roving about
the world, will start on his much-discussed trip to the Holy Land about
the middle of next April.

He is to start from Hamburg on his yacht with his two eldest sons, and
he will return in six weeks.

It is reported that he will then pay a visit to the Sultan at
Constantinople.

Europe watches every move of the Emperor's with the greatest interest
and with curiosity as to whether it has a political significance.

A NEW SPRING-POST FOR BICYCLES.--This post does not seem to have the
objectionable features that other spring-posts have. It is small, neat,
compact, and at the same time does its work admirably, as we have reason
to know, having had it tested. The illustration shows quite clearly how
it is constructed. To the ordinary observer, when it is attached to a
bicycle it appears to be an common seat-post; the spring, however,
prevents the constant vibration which is so trying to the rider and so
hard on the machine, especially in riding over cobblestones.

Riding a machine with this spring-post, as compared with one without it,
is very much like riding in a spring carriage as compared with the
ordinary springless cart.

       *       *       *       *       *

[Illustration: Buoy with light]

A clever invention, which originated in France, is a life-saving buoy
that has been used on the River Seine in Paris. Persons falling into the
water at night often lose their lives because it is impossible to
ascertain their whereabouts; or, if a life-saving apparatus of any kind
is thrown to them in the darkness, they frequently drown before they can
find it. This small apparatus consists of a combination of a buoy with
an electric light; when the buoy is thrown into the water the light is
lighted automatically. In connection with this invention the life-savers
in Paris use a grappling-hook which we illustrate. This has an electric
light near the end in the oval space; this light makes it possible to
grapple for persons who may have gone down beneath the water.

       *       *       *       *       *

[Illustration: Acetylene lamp]

We have also received from France the account of an invention in the
shape of a bicycle lamp in which acetylene is burned. The great
difficulty with the use of acetylene has heretofore been that the gas
will not burn unless under high pressure, and the receptacles in which
the gas is generated could not be so made as to insure them against
exploding. Acetylene gas, as generally used, is generated by bringing
water in contact with the calcium carbide. The gas forms so rapidly that
it is extremely difficult to control it, therefore the attention of
inventors has been directed to this question. This lamp seems to be a
very clever arrangement for producing the gas in the right quantity
without danger of explosion.

It is described very clearly by the illustration herewith. The upper
part, "E," is a small reservoir in which water is put; this water is
released in small quantities through the tube at the right, and, flowing
into the lower part of the lamp, comes in contact with the calcium
carbide, which is in the receptacle "P"; the gas thus generated is held
in the reservoir "G," and when sufficient pressure has been created is
forced out through the burner "B."

The lamp is small and compact; it is but four inches high, and yields a
beautiful bright light which will not blow out. When it is desired to
put the light out, the button "R" is pressed down, thus shutting off the
supply of water; this stops the generation of the gas, and the lamp soon
goes out.

       *       *       *       *       *

"C. H.," Germantown, Pa., asks if the bicycles used in the Klondike have
rubber tires. We have seen no authentic account of the use of bicycles
there. It is extremely improbable that any kind of a bicycle can be used
to advantage in the Arctic regions, although a bicycle may be ridden
with care safely on smooth snow or ice.

ALBERT ROSS PARSONS, _President American College of Musicians_: "For the
purpose of eliciting a free expression of opinion from my son Richard
Percival Parsons, aged 10, I bought a copy of THE GREAT ROUND WORLD for
three or four weeks in succession, and simply left it lying where he
would be likely to see it. In about four weeks he had interested himself
so deeply in its contents that he voluntarily asked if he might
subscribe for it, a wish which I was only too glad to gratify. The bound
volume of the first fifteen numbers has remained his daily mental food
and amusement ever since it arrived. I thank you for your great service
both to our young people and to their elders."

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
