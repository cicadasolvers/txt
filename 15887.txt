THE AMERICAN MISSIONARY

VOL. XLIX.
March, 1895.
No. 3.


In this number of THE MISSIONARY we present our readers with an
interesting variety of information, embracing sketches of personal
observation by secretaries of the Association, letters from field
workers, pictures of pioneers in two important fields, and pictures of
one of our higher institutions. It is with sorrow that we are compelled
to notice the death of our late honored and beloved President, Dr.
William M. Taylor, and that of Professor Painter, so successful and so
faithful in his work among the Indians.

FIELD NOTES.

BY SECRETARY RYDER.


MOUNTAIN WORK.--A very interesting spiritual awakening seems to prevail
in many points of our mountain field. From a pastor of one of these
churches among our American Highlanders we have received the following:
"I have held meetings a couple of weeks, first at the church, and then
at the academy. A large number have been reached. The open meetings
disclosed the new life to all. We held daily meetings of prayer in the
evening, and a large percentage of the students attended. All took part.
The Y.P.S.C.E. has increased fourfold, and all the time is occupied in
their meetings, and often two or three arise to speak at once. Six names
were presented for active membership, and two for associate. The work is
not confined to this single church and academy.

"I went recently to another village and half a dozen committed
themselves for Christ. The Association needs an evangelist to visit
these fields. Audiences fill the churches, most of them people who are
out of Christ. All that prevents meeting this crying want of these
mountain people in supplying to them more intelligent and consecrated
ministers of the Gospel is the lack of money consecrated and given to
this great service. This mountain field is now ripe to the harvest.
Will not the churches multiply their gifts so that we can send into this
harvest field more devoted men who are ready to go if they can do their
work and simply be supported?"

       *       *       *       *       *

The hard times and the difficulty of the mountain people to get clothing
is illustrated in the following, which comes to us in a recent
missionary letter from this mountain field:

"There would have been much more suffering had it not been for the
clothing which has gone out from this school. When seven chickens bring
only thirty-five cents the poor mountain people do not have much
chance."

       *       *       *       *       *

A pastor of the Association among our American Highlanders writes as
follows: "This has been a most blessed and glorious season of
refreshing. In the bounds of my work this fall and winter I have held
and assisted in meetings which have in all resulted in something more
than 100 hopeful conversions. My work now is especially to care for and
look after the welfare of these precious souls lately brought to Christ
and to give as much time as possible to my studies."

       *       *       *       *       *

INDIAN WORK.--Our friends will remember the appeal made by Rev. James F.
Cross, of Rosebud Agency, S.D., at our annual meeting at Elgin, Ill.,
for a chapel to be built at Cedar Butte, S.D. President Gates, moved by
the appeal, took it up so enthusiastically that nearly $400 came from
him and other generous givers. The Indians drew the logs and have just
erected the chapel under the direction of Superintendent Cross. A note
just received from the field contains the following, which abundantly
proves the wisdom of opening this new station at Cedar Butte and helping
the Indians in the erection of their church: "Last week I was up to
Cedar Butte church. It was the first time since it was built that I have
been there for service. I received two young men into the church. It was
a warm day and the thermometer has not been ten degrees away from zero,
except to go thirteen below, since." This chapel at Cedar Butte is the
center of a new work, and this message brings the hopefulness of the
field.

       *       *       *       *       *

"We received five grown persons to our church fellowship on Sunday, and
two children were baptized. Three Christian Indian families were
constituted by Christian marriage at the same time. Praise God!" So
writes Supt. C.L. Hall, of Fort Berthold Indian Mission, N.D.

ARE THEY GRATEFUL?

REV. CHAS. F. SARGENT, THOMASVILLE, GA.


Very often we are asked if the people among whom we labor are grateful
for the work that is done for and among them--whether there is
self-denial on their part in helping themselves in church and school
work.

It is very important that we should have some expression on their part
in regard to this. There are many incidents in which grateful
acknowledgment is made. A few incidents will best answer the above
question.

A little more than a mile from here there lives in an almost
uninhabitable cabin an old lady who is called "Aunt Eliza." I saw her
first one cold day last winter, when I called and found her in bed sick
with pneumonia. We ministered unto her as we best could, providing
medicine, food and clothing.

From a missionary barrel garments were obtained which helped to make her
body comfortable. She depended on the kindness of a neighbor to gather
sticks for her and draw water. At times there was only enough fire in
the fire-place to give a faint glimmer, not enough to make the room
cheerful. Aunt Eliza is old and crippled, and it was only with much care
and patient waiting that in the goodness of God she was restored to
health. Some time passed after her recovery before I saw her. She came
to our house on a hot summer day to bring an offering of gratitude for
God's mercy in giving her back health and strength. She brought to us in
a corner of her handkerchief fifty-five cents which she had saved from
little gifts from children and grandchildren nearly as poor as herself.
She had at this time only meal enough in her house to make one "pone" of
bread. Gratefully she urged upon us her self-denying gift of
thanksgiving. Of course we accepted it, only to return it to her in the
name of the Master, who is the Great Gift Giver. Later in the season our
sister remembered us again. She had saved for us two chickens, but a
"_conjuror_" came along and said he would tell her fortune for them. He
succeeded in "_beating_" her out of her offering for the Lord, and in
return she received nothing. She came and told us all about it. This
good woman did not rest until she brought us one at a time the chickens
that she had promised. When the Association met with us a few days ago
she brought, as her part to help, a few eggs. There are other incidents
in her life which are interesting, but we cannot tell them all now. She
certainly is grateful and gives the "widow's mite" in giving all that
she has. She has been to our church and been blessed in meeting God in
the sanctuary. The first Sunday that she came she bowed and courtesied
to the people as she came in, much to their amusement.

A PIONEER MISSIONARY IN AFRICA.


[Illustration: REV. GEORGE THOMPSON.]

Rev. George Thompson was early enlisted as a missionary in the Mendi
Mission on the west coast of Africa. He had been a most ardent friend of
the slave, active in aiding their escape from the house of bondage, and
as a consequence had spent five years in the Missouri State Prison. He
went to Africa in 1848 under the commission of the American Missionary
Association, and proved himself to be remarkably useful. One of his most
far-reaching efforts was in the work as a peacemaker. A fierce and
unrelenting war had been raging among the tribes around the mission, and
this was brought to a close through the wise and persistent efforts of
Mr. Thompson. He was chosen umpire for the contending chiefs, and after
repeated and wearying excursions, and ten interviews or councils with
both parties, he at length succeeded. Then came the joy which peace
brings. Warriors met and fell on each other's necks; chiefs, who were
for years enemies, now shook hands and embraced each other with the
affection of long-separated friends; sisters, wives and daughters, long
captives, fell into each other's arms, weeping for joy. A chief's
daughter was seen running to embrace her father's feet, a wife hastened
to welcome her husband and children, and entire towns were filled with
cries of gladness. The beatitude, "Blessed are the peacemakers," belongs
to Mr. Thompson.

Ill health at length compelled Mr. Thompson to relinquish the work in
Africa, and in 1856 he returned to Oberlin, Ohio, where he spent five
years in publishing his book on Africa, entitled, "Palm Land," and in
educating two boys whom he brought with him from Africa. In 1861 he
removed with his family to northwestern Michigan, where he labored as a
home missionary for eighteen years, being the pastor for fifteen years
of a church which he established. He then returned to Oberlin, where he
remained until his death in 1893. In all these years Mr. Thompson was a
laborious and useful man, actively engaged in awakening the churches to
an interest in Africa, in writing his books and educating his children.
In his later years, while living in Oberlin, he was abundant in labors
in connection with Sunday-schools and feeble churches in Ohio and other
States.

A PIONEER MISSIONARY AMONG THE INDIANS.


In 1843 a number of young men from Oberlin entered upon a mission among
the Ojibway Indians in the northern part of what is now Minnesota, under
the auspices of the Western Evangelical Missionary Society, which was
soon afterward transferred to the American Missionary Association. Of
the inaccessibility of this field, a competent authority has said:
"There is probably no missionary field to-day on the face of the earth
more difficult to reach than this was at that time."

[Illustration: REV. S.G. WRIGHT.]

Among this group of missionaries was Rev. S.G. Wright. As a part of his
experience it is said that after a short visit at home, Mr. Wright
returned to the mission taking his young wife with him--their wedding
tour. It was a journey of over a month made in a canoe. They were both
compelled to walk at intervals twenty-two miles in the swamps along the
side of the stream until they reached Mr. Barnard's station. These walks
were varied by sickness; Mr. Wright sometimes had chills every day, but
at Mr. Barnard's station he recovered. There remained yet twenty miles
of their journey, and this was undertaken on foot, but soon a storm
brought five inches of snow. Mr. Wright says: "My wife was very lame,
and what woman would not be after walking twenty long miles through mire
and water, over high hills and through gullies, in snow from four to
five inches deep?"

The change wrought by these missionaries can be indicated in a sentence:
When they went there the Indians cultivated almost no land and their
only domestic animals were dogs. They maintained a precarious existence
by hunting and fishing, and the gathering of wild rice, with starvation
as no uncommon experience. In a few years these Indians raised their own
supplies of corn and potatoes, with some to sell to procure other
necessaries; they began to build houses for themselves; had the benefit
of a saw mill and a grist mill, with the blessings of a church and
boarding school.

The Association withdrew from the mission in 1859, but Mr. Wright
returned under other auspices, and spent several years in effective and
useful work. He still lives and is active in Christian labors as a
member of the church in Oberlin.

A SOUTHERN JOURNEY.

BY SECRETARY A.F. BEARD.


It included every Southern State in extent from Virginia to Texas, and
from Texas to Florida. It was a study of schools, their methods and
attainments; it was the acquaintance of new teachers and their work, the
greeting of those who have become old friends, the look into the eyes of
more colored youth in schools than usually falls to one person. It was a
comparative study of classes of all grades in schools of the same grade,
and of schools in different States and environments. It was an
examination of industries in agriculture, industries in mechanics, of
schools, normal and collegiate. It was an inspection of properties; an
inquiry as to the prices of paints and brick and lime and wall papers.

It was a visit to churches, a handshake with pastors and deacons, a
gathering of congregations to "make their wants and wishes known" to
"the Association." One soon learns that the correct use of the definite
article to designate the A.M.A. is not confined to those who have
studied grammar. There is only one Association for these people. They
never call it "American" nor even "Missionary." "The" is all sufficient,
and it does one good to hear his society thus alphabetically
abbreviated, as it does to meet these warm-hearted brethren of the
colored churches which have been nourished with life by "The"
Association. If anyone is suffering from iciness in the cardiac region,
there is no better place for him to get the cockles of his heart well
warmed up than in some of the colored congregations' churches which I
visited. I said some. Alas! there is a difference in churches--in the
South.

I find the schools full of interest, and that in the higher institutions
the girls and young women are side by side in nearly equal numbers with
lads and young men in climbing up the steep hills of education. It is,
indeed, climbing. It takes more time, more patience and more resolution
than most white students with happier conditions can realize.

The characteristics of the student are changing somewhat from the
former days. Pupils are pushing into the more advanced grades earlier
in years. They have not the memories of slavery as had the generations
before them--only the traditions of it, and certain of its
influences--for influences do not die when institutions pass away. There
is not, for example, much old-fashioned Puritanism stalking about in New
York in these days, but considerable of Puritan influence is alive and
is just now contributing to the hopefulness of the times and the
interests of municipal reform and even of the State government.
Influences continue, and it will take time for those of slavery or the
effect on both races to pass away.

One may not particularize among so many schools and churches as were in
the path of my visitation, and one must generalize if he will keep
within limits. For ten years now it has been my privilege to study the
South as a personal observer, not only in schools and churches and not
only on the regular routes of travel, but in the bypaths of rural life
and in talks with all classes and conditions of men of every shade of
color. I may, therefore, be permitted to generalize.

First, it is often said that those who live among evils best understand
them and know how to meet them. This is a fallacy. The missionaries in
China knew better what was for the good of China than did the Emperor
himself. There are people in the United States, also, who could give
some good points to the new Emperor of Russia, and if he would take them
and use them it would be for the advantage of that country. It is true
that impressions are not facts, and one cannot run over a fashionable
route of travel holding converse with some hospitable Southern host and
return with much more than impressions. Such are likely to speak with
more confidence than knowledge, but, on the other hand, one who confines
himself to a single locality in the South and to the local facts is more
likely to have his views lean to inclination than to truth. One's
opinion ought to be estimated by his information. I have known an
otherwise intelligent citizen of New Orleans to be ignorant of the
existence of Straight University with its 500 students and its noble
accomplishment. A citizen of New York in this case could give the
citizen of New Orleans some information about the South.

Secondly, the negroes are gaining. Never were the schools better in
their entire range in different States, the studies more exacting, the
purpose on the part of students for mastery in their work more resolute.
Never was there manifested a more self-reliant spirit. The people are
having a hard time just now; many are poorer than ever before, but the
negroes are gaining, inch by inch. There are millions in schools and
unreached millions yet who could not read a word in the New Testament if
they had one; but the gain is seen in many ways; in schools, in
churches, in homes, and in the improved quality and character of the
newspapers edited by colored men, as also in their increased numbers.
The schools under the direction and superintendence of colored teachers
are gaining in standing and worthiness.

Thirdly, the white South is gaining. Not very rapidly, but gaining. The
lawless part of the South--and there is a lawless part--is as lawless as
ever. The lower and more violent elements, however, are but a small part
of the Southern people. Still they know that the general public opinion
is not positive enough to condemn them in any question between the
negroes and the whites; hence they are not afraid to do what they will
with the negro. The great body of the Southern people are law-abiding,
with the single exception that they do not propose to respect the
Fifteenth Amendment. They are committed against this. They deprecate
lawlessness. They are personally kind to the negroes. They are busy in
the ordinary duties of life, but the lawless know that these good people
will never disturb them in their injustices to the negro. Then, there is
a relatively small element of the people who are prophets of a better
day. They themselves often feel the slavery of a public opinion which
puts odium upon them when they are too friendly in behalf of the
oppressed colored man. They cannot oppose many things which they feel to
be wrong without losing their influence. These seers of the future are
in hearty sympathy with our work and give it such personal encouragement
as they may under the tyrannical conditions of a public opinion not
friendly to equal rights on the part of the negro.

There is a great gain, also, in Southern public opinion as to the
capacity of the colored man and his possible future. This gain is seen
in the better provisions for the colored public schools, in towns and
cities. The schools of the A.M.A. are both object lessons and incentives
for the education of the white as well as the colored in the public
schools. The South is exceedingly sensitive as to the opinion of the
North. A trifle of published criticism, for example, goes through the
Southern papers with rebuttals enough to break down a national
constitution. An imperfect and incorrect report of an interview, which
lived just long enough to be printed, has been lately passionately
confuted in certain Southern newspapers with a profusion of epithets
which were out of all proportion to the harmless nonsense committed to
the press by an untrained reporter--a new illustration of the extreme
sensitiveness of the South to Northern opinion. Northern sentiment is
often ridiculed, and frequently sends not a few Southern newspapers into
spasms, but it is heeded. Let it be kindly and true, and pressed
fraternally and constantly "In His Name" who came

  "To take away transgressions
  And set the captive free."

       *       *       *       *       *

THE VALUE OF PURE AND INTELLIGENT CHURCHES.


The extract given below has the true ring. It is from one of the pastors
of the American Missionary Association educated at Tougaloo and Howard
Theological Seminary. If sometimes our church work seems small and
discouraging there are many things to be remembered. Many times we are
told by the pastors of our churches "we could have larger churches and
more of them if we would accept the standards of those about us."
Moreover, some little church with fifty members may be doing more for
the cause of Christ than some big church of ten times the number. But,
read the extract:

"In the battle of Milliken's Bend, a color bearer was seen far in
advance of his company. The captain shouted to him, 'Bring those colors
back to the army!' The reply was sent back, 'Bring the army up to the
colors.'

"Just so, in the Carolinas, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee,
and the South generally, our church is lifting up the standard, and
although men are constantly trying to get the standard bearer to fall
back to the army of biased, narrow humanity, the church ever shouts back
the reply of the immortal color bearer, 'Bring the army up to the
colors.'

"Every man and woman going out from our schools is imbued with the
thought that he or she is to hold up the standard of God--not man--for
the people. Every church, school or mission fostered by the A.M.A. is
holding up the highest ideals of all life. And while our work does not
grow in numbers as rapidly as we could wish, we are broadcasting the
good seeds of the Kingdom over all the land, and here and there they are
springing into life, bringing forth fruit--some thirty, some sixty, and
some an hundred fold; so we go on grinding out the grist ever and anon
holding one for toll. I am not ignorant of what other churches are
doing, and some are doing nobly, but ours is the great work. It has been
my observation, that wherever an enterprising work is being carried on
in church or school, the leading force is generally the product of
Congregational effort, directly or indirectly. So take away our work,
then it would be like blotting out the sun, moon and most of the stars
from the sky."

A COLORED MAN WINS.--Charles W. Wood, of Chicago, a colored contestant
for oratorical honors, has won the first prize in Beloit College, Wis. A
few years ago he was a newsboy upon the street, but he made up his mind
to have an education. With the aid of a generous patron he has nearly
completed his college course and justified the high hopes of his many
friends.

TILLOTSON, AUSTIN, TEXAS.

BY SECRETARY A.F. BEARD.


In the year 1875 the Rev. George J. Tillotson, of Connecticut, visited
various points of the South with a view to the establishment of a
school. He was accompanied by a secretary of the Association. After a
careful survey they selected Austin, Texas, as the most promising point.
About twenty-five acres of partially wooded land just beyond the eastern
boundary of the city of Austin were purchased for $5,000, the gift of
Mr. Tillotson. In the following year a charter was obtained and the work
of raising money for the building was entered upon. The funds were
finally secured, and in 1879 the foundations were laid, and the
building, 104 feet in length and 42 in depth, constructed of white
pressed brick with dress stone trimmings, rose to its five stories in
height. On the 17th of January, 1881, the school opened. Two of the five
floors were then open spaces. Eleven pupils only were enrolled at the
beginning, but the term closed in June with 107. During this year the
building was completed and named "Allen Hall," in honor of one of the
largest givers. At the opening of the fall term the beginning of the
next year, the accommodations were taxed to the utmost. In August, 1882,
the report reads, "Allen Hall is full to repletion, 100 in the boarding
department. Work cannot unfold for need of more room. Young men and
young women in the same building make an urgent appeal for a new
building."

At no time since the beginning of the second year have there been
adequate accommodations for all desiring to attend.

For ten years the institution under the name of "Tillotson Collegiate
and Normal Institute" has furnished to students from all parts of the
great State of Texas with its half million of colored people, and from
other States, and from Mexico, not only an opportunity to acquire a
thoroughly practical common-school education, but also a more extended
course to prepare students for entrance to the highest educational
institutions in the land; and a normal training course for teachers for
all positions in the public schools. Within this period of time a church
has been formed for the students of the institution and others, which
has been regularly ministered to by the president of the institution.

In the year 1888 a building for carpentry and manual instruction was
erected and a teacher was appointed for industrial training.

The picture following is that of Allen Hall as it looks down upon the
valley of the river Colorado. In every direction the views are of great
extent, and include many picturesque scenes. The State capitol--a mile
distant--and the various public buildings of Austin, are before the eye.
Since electricity has been introduced, Austin by night presents a
brilliant outlook from the grounds of the institution, but the light
which shines from these buildings on the hill sends its beams farther
than those of the electric plant, and pierces a denser darkness than
that of night.

[Illustration: ALLEN HALL.]

The industrial buildings--viz., the shop for carpentry, another for
blacksmithing, for repairing of vehicles, and for painting--are at a
suitable distance in the rear on the "boys' side" of the grounds. Below
them are located the barn, wagon house, hennery, etc.

On the crest of a second eminence, several hundred feet from "Allen
Hall," is the attractive new building (see picture, page 100) used as a
dormitory for teachers and young women pupils. In this building are the
culinary department also, and the dining room for each hall. There are
forty dormitory rooms in this hall which will accommodate sixty pupils
and their teachers. In addition to its dining-hall for all the pupils
within the institution there are reading and sewing rooms, etc., which
add to its completeness. There are not many school buildings anywhere
with more diversified landscape and beautiful natural surroundings than
those of Tillotson. Encompassed by oak trees large enough for shade and
shelter, but not over-towering the prospect, free from the distracting
noises and dust of the streets, and yet possessing all the advantages of
a thrifty and beautiful city, the student at Tillotson will have at
least one period in life that may not be commiserated.

This new building has not yet been duly named, and if anyone of those
who may read this sketch will give $1,000 to be used as an endowment
fund, the interest to be applied year by year as long as the school
stands, we shall be glad to name this new hall after the giver, unless
the name should happen to be too un-euphonious. Would not this beautiful
hall be a fine monument to bear the name of some considerate and
generous giver?

[Illustration: NEW HALL: DORMITORY FOR TEACHERS AND PUPILS.]

Tillotson was chartered under the corporate name of "Institute." This
charter has now expired, and since the institution has blossomed out
with the possibilities of a college it is hoped that under the new
charter it may bear the name of "College."

It has the following departments: Common English, Normal, College
Preparatory, College, Vocal and Instrumental Music, and Industrial, and
a department for trained nurses. The faculty of the institution has
consisted of the president, the normal principal, the industrial
teacher, and ten other teachers. The boarding department is conducted
upon the model of a Christian household. The intention is by no means
simply to furnish rooms and meals for those who are in attendance, but
also to inculcate ideas of right living and thinking, which are
indispensable to true manhood and womanhood.

In the Common English department the purpose is to prepare the pupils
thoroughly for the practical duties of life.

The College Preparatory gives a careful preparation in the way of
language studies which will fit them to enter into the more generous
course of study in which they may be fitted to be intelligent preachers
and leaders of their race. The demand for college-educated men among the
negroes is an intelligent one. This race cannot be elevated unless there
can be raised a sufficient number of strong, earnest men, thoroughly
trained intellectually, as well as morally; men who shall have a larger
than a local vision, and who shall stand forth as representative leaders
and teachers of those less fortunate than themselves.

The Normal department adds the study of subjects and methods, for those
who are preparing to become teachers among their own people.

The Industrial includes not only manual instruction, but carpentry,
blacksmithing and mechanical drawing for boys and young men, and also
sewing and dressmaking for girls and young women.

[Illustration: MANUAL INSTRUCTION SHOP.]

For a young institution the record of Tillotson is excellent. There are
few places in the great empire of Texas where it has not already become
known through its pupils, or through teachers who have received their
education within its walls.

Being under the care of a distinctively Christian organization it
carries out the intention of its founders in providing religious
instruction for all who attend. Its Sunday School, its Christian
Endeavor Societies, its social worship, its church service, its mission
work, all intensify the religious influence and religious life.

Tillotson is far away and needs friends who will give it help. It needs
scholarships and professorships. It needs a library, chemical and
philosophical apparatus, and a printing press. It needs gifts of
bedding, tableware for the halls, and clothing for needy students.
Friends, it needs your Christian sympathy and Christian prayers, that
the great and blessed Teacher may dwell within its walls and in the
hearts of the inmates.

DEATH OF DR. TAYLOR.


Nine years ago we were called upon to record the death of Governor
Washburn, President of this Association. While he was seemingly in the
fullness of life and while on the platform at the meeting of the
American Board he suddenly and unexpectedly fell asleep in death. In a
far different way did his successor, Rev. William M. Taylor, D.D., meet
in quietude and with patient resignation the summons that called him
home. The premonition of death came three years ago, and the march has
been steady to the close. During these months his patience and sweet
assurance have been as marked illustrations of the power of the Gospel
as other graces were in his more active career.

Dr. Taylor, long before he became President of this Association, took a
deep interest in its work and brought to it his own personal influence
and that of his large and wealthy congregation. As a presiding officer
he was constant in his attendance, and by the dignity of his manner and
his great force of character gave guidance and strength to the
gatherings of our annual meeting. But Dr. Taylor was broad, and his
sympathies went forth to every form of endeavor for the spread of the
Gospel and the benefit of mankind. With a strong character derived from
his Scottish ancestry, he had made his mark as a pastor in the growth of
a church under his care in the old country. Nearly a quarter of a
century ago he came to this city, and by his commanding eloquence, his
pastoral gifts and the books which flowed from his pen, he has exerted a
wide and salutary influence. On great occasions, at college
anniversaries and at missionary and ecclesiastical gatherings, Dr.
Taylor was one of the most acceptable and efficient speakers. One marked
characteristic of Dr. Taylor came from his great heart, and mellowed and
sweetened all his other powers. He has finished a glorious course, and
has gone to his reward.

REV. CHAS. C. PAINTER.


The recent death of Prof. Painter has removed a most useful and
efficient worker in behalf of the Indians. He died at his home in
Washington, of heart disease, after an illness of only twelve hours. He
was sixty-two years old, born in Virginia, but resident for most of his
life in New England, where he was an acceptable pastor. He was called
from that position into the service of the American Missionary
Association, acting for a time as Professor in Fisk University. He,
however, soon gave his life to promoting the education and civilization
of the Indians, and for ten years was connected with the Indian Rights
Association. It was a tribute to his knowledge and service in the Indian
work that about a year ago he was appointed a member of the Board of
Indian Commissioners.

ONE MISSIONARY DAY.

MISS S.E. OBER, EVARTS, KY.


At work again. Back from the rest and change of the summer vacation.
Leaving behind friends and home, comforts and pleasures, and nearly all
the advantages of civilization. But coming to a greater joy, a higher
privilege than any of these can afford--the "high calling" of our
Master, to minister to poor, needy souls in His name.

So with great happiness we gather up the loose threads and the dropped
stitches of last year's work, and start anew. Come with us through one
day, and taste a few of a missionary's joys. After our household tasks
are over, and we have gained new power from our daily devotions, we
start out on our work. Over one hundred boys and girls give us bright
greetings as we ride past. We must go on horseback, as there are no
_good_ roads in our vicinity.

We are entirely compassed about with mountains; on every side they lift
their grand heads in everlasting testimony of the wonderful handiwork of
the Almighty. But we have little time to gaze upon their beauty, for
more precious creations of the same great Hand are needing our
attention.

See this little hovel, built of rough logs, scarcely serving to keep out
the wind or the rain. Let us enter. A most pitiful sight awaits us. The
fever has been before us. For months it has raged, and two human souls
have been taken from the family which dwells here. On a rude filthy bed
lies the wasted frame of a once stalwart man. He is as feeble as the
infant; a wan child is sitting near by. The mother, in tattered
garments, totters about her work, so enfeebled by the disease that her
strength is inadequate for her tasks. Three of the children are nothing
but skeletons, and sit listlessly on the floor, taking but little
notice of anything going on about them.

The thin faces light up at sight of us, and a cordial welcome is
extended. The only whole chair is brought forward for our use. You might
expect a torrent of complaints from these poor creatures. But no,
instead come words of praise to God that He had spared so many of their
lives, that He had been _with_ them in their sufferings.

A year ago, when we visited this hut, we found them stolid and
indifferent, caring nothing for spiritual things. The woman sat smoking
over the fire, scarcely vouchsafing us a word, and muttered to a crony,
"Wot's thet thar woman nosing 'bout yere for? She'd er heap sight better
let we uns erlone."

It was very hard to ask permission to hold prayers with them in such a
hostile atmosphere, but it is our duty to "sow beside _all_ waters," so
we proffered our request.

"Yer kin ef yer mines ter. I haint er carin'," was the ungracious reply.

But what a change _now_. The woman's face glows with a light that only
comes from the "light of the world." "God's been mighty good ter we
uns," she says. "Ef hit hedn't ben fer Him we'd er died. An' we uns air
bound ter do ez near right ez we kin, an' serve ther Lord, ther hull lot
on us."

Does it not make our own hearts glow to hear such words, and see the
wonders God hath wrought? And with thanksgiving we read and pray with
them, and strengthen their faith with God's Word. After noting their
needs, and promising to supply them from the articles sent us by
generous Northern friends, we go on to the next house.

We find the same sad state of affairs; fever-worn men and women, wasted
children, and starvation and want staring them in the face. But we find
also the same great change. God's Spirit has been working among them,
and hearts are softened and lives changed by His power. So we go from
hut to hut, until the way becomes too steep to ride, and we leave our
horses and climb, on foot, the lofty, rocky ridges.

We find men who were reckless and bad ready to listen to God's Word, and
in broken voices asking for prayers. We find women who have lived lives
of open shame penitent and contrite, showing by their abandonment of
their evil ways that they are sincere when they say, oh so earnestly,
"We uns air tryin' ter do right."

But all is not so encouraging. We must visit homes where vice reigns
supreme; where women are lost to shame, and glory in their sin; where
even the children have the "trail of the serpent" upon their young
faces; where the men are brutal and beastly, and even sickness does not
_touch_ them.

Let us call at this old log house as we pass; nestled under a high
cliff, with the creek flowing past, it looks like some ugly blot on the
"face of nature." But it is a _school-house_. There is no window, no
chimney, only a hole in the side of the house, opening into a sort of
pen of rocks, in which the fire is built; an admirable arrangement to
send all the heat out of doors, and the smoke into the house. Several
rough benches (that do not invite to ease or comfort) and an ancient
chair complete the furniture of the room. Several boards painted black
form the "blackboards." Here we find two tattered urchins and three tiny
girls, whose faces have evidently not made the acquaintance of soap and
water for some days.

The teacher is one of the advanced pupils of our academy--a bright young
man, who will attend our school when his is completed. We ask where the
rest of the scholars are.

"Pulling fodder or stripping cane," is the reply. And the children have
to work so much in the fields that they seldom have the chance of
attending school. Out of fifty or sixty scholars only a very few ever
attend these public schools. But it is growing late, and we have a long,
rough way before us, so we spur on toward home, reaching it just as the
glow of the sunset dies away from the last distant peak and the dusky
twilight settles down over the whole land.

A hurried supper and then to the church prayer meeting. Here are
gathered quite a number, and we have a very good meeting, feeling the
presence of our Saviour in our midst. So closes one of our days, and
wearied in body, but refreshed and strengthened in spirit, we go to
rest.

SOUTHERN FIELD NOTES.

REV. GEORGE W. MOORE.


The mission station recently opened at La Pine, in the black belt of
Alabama, is a door of hope to that needy people. The people came for
miles around to greet the missionary and to hear the Gospel. At another
point in Alabama we found a promising field which one of our theological
graduates from Talladega had opened. He began the work in a rented hall
at his own cost, and after he had gathered a congregation and found it a
needy and at the same time a hopeful field he raised the "Macedonian
cry" to the American Missionary Association for help. The Pauline
heroism of this brother in preaching the Gospel in his own hired house
is shared by our brethren in various parts of our Southern field. The
work is so large and the needs of the people are so great that this
spirit of Christ must be more fully expressed, both in gifts and
service, to reach the pressing calls for help.

I met three interesting characters in the black belt of Georgia. The
first was named Moses. On meeting him he addressed me with "You don't
knows me, does you? My name is Moses." His friend "Uncle Plenty" lived
in a little cabin by the roadside. He had heard of the Association, and
was glad to greet me as one of its missionaries. He told me that he felt
so thankful for what the Northern friends had done for his people that
he wished his little cabin and half acre lot to be bequeathed to the
American Missionary Association. I dined with "Uncle Plenty" and met
Father Joshua, a poor old blind man ninety years of age, in his cabin.
They told me the story of their lives in slavery and how they had prayed
to see this day of freedom and light.

Moses and Joshua and "Uncle Plenty" are types of the old people and
times that are giving place to a new generation and a brighter day.

Among the new enterprises reported at the meeting of the Georgia
Association at Thomasville, Ga., were two churches and several missions
from the vicinity of Columbia, S.C.

I spent Thanksgiving Day at Lowell, N.C. Our mission at this point is
the only church in that vicinity. It was the first Thanksgiving service
they had ever enjoyed or even heard of. It was held in a log cabin.

Lowell is the center of a large negro settlement; the people have had a
hard lot, and but little opportunity to improve their condition. They
are very grateful to hear the Gospel.

Forefather's day was observed by the Nashville churches in the
theological hall of Fisk University. We "spiritual children" of the
Pilgrims honor the fathers whose descendants have enriched us through
the A.M.A. by the schools and churches that have been planted among us.
The church at Lexington, Ky., had a season of "refreshing" in December,
when several heads of families united with it. Howard church, Nashville,
also had an awakening with good results. This church has increased its
membership fifty per cent. in fifteen months. Jackson Street Church,
Nashville, held a recognition service for its new pastor in January.

We were glad to greet the churches and brethren of Louisiana after an
absence from them of two years. The Spain Street Church at New Orleans
held a series of Gospel meetings in which a number avowed their faith in
the Saviour, and the church was strengthened.

Straight University is crowded with an earnest class of students.

This school is doing a great work for the people of Louisiana and
surrounding States. In spite of the hard times, which are very severe in
the South (laborers in Louisiana and some other States receive only
fifty cents a day and board themselves), the people are making great
sacrifices for the education of their children, and our pastors and
teachers are making heroic struggles that the work in school and church
may go forward.

The need of the continuance of the work was never greater and the
results of the service of our workers were never better. To retrench
further at this time would not only cripple the work among the needy
peoples of our field, but shut the door of opportunity in many places,
and injure the people in their efforts to rise, and discourage our
self-sacrificing missionaries. The people are grateful for these schools
and churches and need more of them. We appeal to our Northern friends to
come to the rescue of the American Missionary Association at this time.

A SCHOOLBOY'S COMPOSITION.


A little lad six years of age in the primary grade of Knox Institute,
Athens, Ga., attended rhetoricals in which several pupils read
compositions on the subject of America. He was greatly impressed, went
home, and wrote without supervision the composition below. Although he
has put the raccoon, lion and tiger among the birds, it is certainly a
pretty good composition for the first one written by a child six years
of age. Could any of the children six years old to whom THE AMERICAN
MISSIONARY may come do better than this little black boy?

AMERICA.

America is a large country, and it has many large rivers, and it has
many animals, and has wild creatures.

America is a most important country. And many a people like to go there.
And it has many wild birds--mocking birds, nightingale, raccoon, and
also the opossum and lion, tiger, elephant, and the rhinoceros.

And in America there are lakes, seas, and the bushes are so thick that
you can hardly tell when a human is beside them.

The States in America are so large that ten hundred can get in these.
But if one of the animals was to seize you once you would never want to
go there any more, for if one of them get hold of you you would hollow
like anything. It would settle your hash. It would frighten you so much
you never would want to see one of them.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
