    error."--_English Review._

    "This tale is singularly well conceived."--_Evangelical Magazine._

    "We can recommend it with confidence."--_Christian Times._

=BACON, Rev. H. B.=--Lectures for the Use of Sick Persons. By the Rev.
H. B. BACON, M.A. Fcap. cloth, 2_s._ 6_d._

    "The Lectures possess two very great recommendations. First,--they
    are brief, concise, and to the point; and secondly,--the language
    is plain, free from ambiguity, and scriptural. * * * It may be very
    profitably meditated upon by the sick; and young clergymen will not
    lay it down after perusal without having derived some
    instruction."--_Christian Guardian._

    "This is an entertaining book, written in an unambitious and clear
    style, showing the elevating influence of religion, and the baneful
    effects of neglecting it. The moral of the story is healthful and
    not overdrawn, although rather hackneyed. We cordially praise the
    book for its earnestness and simplicity."--_Public Opinion._

    "This little book is so well written, that we trust it will
    have a very wide circulation. Mrs. Bateman's clever volume is
    admirably adapted for young people, but all may profit by its
    contents."--_Examiner._

    for an inscription.

    is thus sketched, under no ordinary circumstances, by the only
    surviving member of the family. There is nothing of maudlin
    sentimentalism in the book; it conveys some weighty lessons to the
    Christian reader."--_Liverpool Courier._

    "So many applications are made to us for histories suited to a
    period of life when the mind is beginning to develope its power,
    and to find satisfaction in connecting the past with the present
    and the future in human affairs, that we are induced to recommend
    these volumes, which, however widely circulated, have not half the
    circulation which they deserve. They are clearly written. They
    neither minister to childish imbecility, nor take for granted a
    measure of knowledge which cannot be lawfully expected of the
    young. They present the page of history as it really is--not a
    series of dry details, nor of gorgeous spectacles, but with enough
    of plain fact to instruct the understanding, and of romantic
    incident to kindle the sympathies and affections."--_Christian
    Observer._

    "We have no hesitation in saying, that this is one of the best
    histories of the Roman Empire for children and young people which
    has come under our notice. Mrs. Hamilton Gray has made herself
    acquainted with at least some of the more important ancient
    writers on the subject of which she treats, and also with the
    criticisms of Niebuhr and other modern investigators of Roman
    history."--_Athenaeum._

    "It may be recommended as a clear, rapid, and well-arranged
    summary of facts, pointed by frequent but brief reflections....
    The book is a very good compendium of the Imperial History,
    primarily designed for children, but useful for
    all."--_Spectator._

    "It would be an erroneous impression to convey of this volume,
    that it is written solely for schools and children. In reality it
    is an abridgment far more likely to be useful to grown-up persons,
    who can reflect upon the working of general laws, and make their
    own observations upon men and things. A striking characteristic of
    the book is the impartiality of its political tone and its high
    moral feeling."--_Examiner._

=GRIFFITH, Rev. T.=--The Fatherhood of God. By the Rev. THOMAS GRIFFITH,
A.M. Prebendary of St. Paul's, and Minister of Ram's Episcopal Chapel,
Homerton. Fcap. 8vo. cloth, 4_s._ 6_d._

    "This is a thoughtful and valuable book, from an Author
    advantageously known by his former publications. It is divided
    into three parts: the Fatherhood of God Asserted, the Fatherhood
    of God Vindicated, the Fatherhood of God Established. There are
    phenomena which seem to contradict the notion we are justly taught
    to form of the Deity. How are we to understand them? What are we
    to infer from them? Questions of this kind have perplexed and
    distressed many minds. Mr. Griffith considers them sensibly and
    scripturally; and we feel convinced that the study of his work
    will satisfy many doubts. We are much pleased with the chapter on
    the toleration of Moral Evil. There are also some judicious
    remarks on prayer, the position it holds in regard to God's
    assumed immutability. In short, many of the topics now specially
    exercising men's thoughts are here well treated."--_Church of
    England Magazine._

    "The Divine Fatherhood is the most soul-invigorating and
    soul-raising of all truths; whilst practically disregarded by the
    world, it is often concealed from congregations by the cloudy
    dogmas of the pulpit. We gratefully hail, therefore, every attempt
    of the pulpit to bring out this grand truth in bold relief before
    the consciences of men. This is no commonplace production. Many of
    the thoughts are strikingly original, the reasoning is everywhere
    close and cogent; the illustrations are telling; the style is
    pithy and pungent; and the spirit that of a manly and catholic
    evangelism."--_The Homilist._

    "They are, in truth, as appears to us, compositions of very rare
    merit, and realise a notion we have always entertained, that a
    sermon for our rural congregations there somewhere was, if it
    could be hit off, which in language should be familiar without
    being plain, and in matter solid without being

    "This is an account of one of the lambs of Christ's fold, who
    exhibited the truest simplicity and natural character of a child,
    united to unwavering trust in and love to that Saviour, who took
    her early to himself. It is calculated both to interest, and, we
    trust, greatly to profit, our young friends, as a pattern of early

    render them pre-eminently practical."--_Britannia._

    "A set of plain, spirited discourses, which are not unlikely to
    disturb the repose of the drowsy, and to send home simple truths
    to the hearts that heed them. The Sermons are, besides, scriptural
    in their doctrinal views, charitable in temper, unpolemical rather
    asserting the truth than contending for it."--_Christian

=HEADLAND and SWETE.=--St. Paul's Epistles to the Thessalonians. With an

Fellow of Caius College, and Curate of Blagdon, Somerset. Crown 8vo.
cloth, 4_s._

    "This work is admirably adapted to answer the purpose for which it
    has been prepared and published; viz. that of supplying the wants
    of intelligent and inquiring readers of the Holy Scriptures with
    the means of becoming acquainted with the best results of modern
    Biblical research, who have not the learning requisite for seeking
    them in the critical and elaborate works which have been put forth
    of late."--_Clerical Journal._

    "This will be found a valuable little book, illustrating the
    Epistles in question rather with a devotional than a critical
    purpose."--_John Bull._

    "We can bear testimony to the scriptural orthodoxy, evangelical
    spirit, accurate scholarship, and lucid style which characterise
    it throughout. The notes are brief, but to the point, and omit no
    topic of interest or importance, and are interspersed with
    apposite sayings from commentators, ancient and modern, which
    often contain a world of truth. The 'Practical Thoughts' bring the
    truth of each chapter to bear on the heart and the conscience in a
    plain and instructive way, which renders the book very useful for
    reading at family worship; and a carefully-written Appendix
    presents the reader with a digest and criticism of the various
    interpretations which have been put forth on the Man of sin of the
    second chapter."--_Record._

    "The contents of this volume embrace the topics handled in 'Essays
    and Reviews,' and expose in many respects very well the errors of
    that notorious volume. If we do not agree with all Mr. Heard's

    "'The Holy Places and other Poems' are of no common order; the
    thoughts being finely conceived, and the expression very perfect.
    The Sonnets deserve to be generally known."--_Clerical Journal._

    "Chaste, sweet, and musical are these poems. There is a spirit of
    natural poetry in every throb of her muse, and one can hardly rise
    from a perusal of this little volume without having imbibed
    pleasure and instruction."--_Critic._

    "There is vigour and freshness about these poems, combined with
    much real earnestness of purpose."--_Bell's Messenger._

    "These poems are conceived in an eminently pious spirit, and
    marked by a very fair amount of literary ability. The proceeds of

    "This book will have a special charm for those who, like the
    writer, have been in the habit of visiting the poor, or in any way

    "There is here sufficient material given for an estimate of cost,
    and in the simple elegance of the designs and well-packed
    arrangement of the accommodation which they give, is evidence of
    the thorough fitness of the authoress for the benevolent work she
    has undertaken. Nothing can be more simple or in better taste than
    the style of the buildings here recommended; and an examination of
    the designs will show that Lady Kerrison has here made a very
    useful contribution to the efforts now being made to improve the

    where, as the grand music rolls on the ear, the eye is almost
    everywhere enchanted with visions of unearthly interest and
    scriptural beauty, breaking in richest colour from its storied
    windows, while the soul is touched and stirred with the deepest

     "A volume much wanted, well considered, sufficiently comprehensive
     to form a manual for clerical readers, &c."--_Christian Observer._

     "This is a valuable work ... the most valuable manual we have on
     the subject."--_Christian Remembrancer._

     "Mr. Moore has succeeded in advancing many principles and
     suggestions by which success (in preaching) may be obtained. A
     work of the kind was wanted.... The various topics included in the
     idea of a good sermon are fully discussed, and many admirable
     hints are furnished on the parts and arrangements of a sermon,--on
     style in relation to preaching,--the delivery of a sermon, on
     extempore preaching, &c."--_Journal of Sacred Literature._

     "So far as we are aware the present will be found to be the most
     exhaustive treatise upon the subject that exists. Mr. Moore writes
     in a tone of excellent common sense. Its perusal is almost a duty
     for the clergy, and will not be without interest for the
     laity."--_Literary Gazette._

     "Mr. Moore is a master in pulpit addresses; his suggestions are
     therefore entitled to great attention. We should like to put this
     volume into the hands of all candidates for the university, of all
     young clergymen, and of many old ones too. There is much of wise
     observation and judicious admonition in the book. It deserves to
     be carefully studied."--_Church of England Magazine._

     "It is an admirable treatise. The young clergyman, and those who
     are not young, but who have yet a good deal to learn, will do well
     to make themselves familiar with it."--_British Quarterly Review._

     "On all these subjects Mr. Moore treats fully, clearly, and
     earnestly, and introduces a great deal of illustration in the way
     of anecdote, or quotations from various well-known authors. The
     book is thus very interesting, apart from the great end it
     contemplates, and cannot be read without profit."--_Clerical
     Journal._

    'Stories about St. Paul' a serviceable book."--_Athenaeum._

    "A concise narrative of the most memorable incidents connected
    with the life and death of the Apostle, rendered in familiar
    language, adapted to the awakening intelligence of very young
    children. The events are given in separate chapters, and may be
    referred to as daily lessons or otherwise; and as the pleasant
    style of the authoress is exceedingly well suited to the
    perceptions of the little ones for whom she has laboured, we have
    no doubt her 'Stories about St. Paul' will become popular in the
    nursery, and also in the infant schools."--_St James's Chronicle._

    "The little readers of 'Stories about St. Paul' will, by the time
    they have reached the last page of this pretty volume, know more

    manner and exposition which well adapt them for family perusal,
    especially as their style is neat and simple, not
    bare."--_Spectator._

    "The many who have read the first volume of these sermons will
    welcome, no doubt with joy, the appearance of the second. They are
    readable and preachable; and those of the second volume are even

Edition. Fcap. 8vo. cloth, 2_s._ 6_d._

    "Mr. Niven has done ample justice to this beautiful chapter. He
    has gone thoroughly into the literature of the subject; has fairly
    grappled with all the difficulties of the passage as they arise;
    has given his solution of them in a clear and convincing manner;
    and has so conducted the whole argument, that while it is all
    along expository it is also, and pari passu, eminently
    practical."--_British and Foreign Evangelical Review._

    "It is replete with very precious lessons touching the great
    subject of which it treats. Let this book be thoroughly worked
    into the head, and into the heart, and death will have no terrors.
    It exhibits the Saviour's work in reference to mortality and
    immortality, with great beauty and feeling."--_British Standard._

    "A plain, simple, and practical exposition of one of the most
    cheering and consolatory portions of Holy Writ that was ever given
    to the Christian Church, combined with an earnestness of purpose
    which does infinite credit to the clergyman who has prepared
    it."--_Bell's Weekly Messenger._

    "We think this an admirable specimen of thoroughly Evangelical
    Pulpit teaching; and it is our earnest prayer that, from all the
    pulpits of our land, matter so good touching the King may be heard
    from Sabbath to Sabbath. We heartily commend this volume to our
    readers."--_Weekly Review._

    "We have much pleasure in commending this little work to the
    public, for we believe it will carry comfort into many a bereaved
    and mourning home, and prove useful in throwing much light on the
    great subject with which it deals."--_Record._

    "We think this a valuable little book. We are much interested with
    the chapter on 'the resurrection body;' and we willingly recommend
    the volume for its devout tone and weighty practical
    lessons."--_Church of England Magazine._

    "We give this volume our heartiest commendation. It is suitable
    either for family reading, for the study, or for the
    closet."--_English Presbyterian Review._

    many a sorrowing mourner which it is so fully calculated to
    give."--_Christian Advocate._

    and its style is chaste, classic, and free from all tawdry
    ornament."--_British and Foreign Evangelical Review._

    "Mr. Niven writes on a difficult subject with moderation and
    ability, and shows that the subject of the Redeemer's kingdom may
    be so studied as to be practical and profitable to the simple
    Christian."--_Christian Observer._

cloth, with Illustrations. 4_s._ 6_d._

    "These letters from 'Over the Sea' contain just the kind of
    information that one wishes to have about the country and the
    people of India, and the mode of life of the English in the East.
    The description of scenery and sketches of native character and
    customs are graphic and entertaining, and the pictures are all the
    more vivid from the style being such as was deemed most adapted
    for youthful readers."--_Literary Gazette._

    "... their tone is so manly, sensible, and affectionate, with a
    pervading element of unobtrusive religious principle, that it is
    impossible to read them without a feeling of regard for the
    anonymous writer, and interest in his youthful
    correspondents."--_Guardian._

    simplicity."--_Record._

    defence against some of the errors of the day."--_Clerical
    Journal._

    "Are chiefly worth noticing for the preface about 'Essays and
    Reviews,' prefixed to the volume. It contains a great deal of good
    sense, and of sound and thoughtful remark, well expressed; and it
    deals with the case on its true footing, by treating the imperfect
    scepticism of the advanced portion of the Essayists as merely a
    gateway to the more logical and consistent infidelity of the

    "Mrs. Harriet Power is an old-established favourite. On this
    occasion she has written eight stories to illustrate the
    Beatitudes contained in the introductory verses of the portion of
    Scripture known as the Sermon on the Mount. They are full of
    incident, admirably illustrate human character, and enforce the
    blessedness of the peculiar graces of meekness, purity,
    peacemaking, humility, mercy, and forgiveness, which it is their
    purpose to enforce."--_Press._

    "In this well-bound and admirably printed volume we have eight
    tales of a religious character, likely to increase the love of the
    young for religion, and to lead those of mature years to
    serviceable reflections. As aids to serious thought, and as a
    choice contribution to religious literature, we can cordially
    commend this work."--_Public Opinion._

    "It is needless to say that everything in the volume bears the
    impress of the author's mind and character. Sound evangelical

cloth, 9_s._

    "We have had heretofore occasion favourably to notice productions
    from Mr. Rawnsley's pen. We are glad to say that we find much to
    commend in the present volume. The Sermons it contains are plain,
    earnest, and devout. We cite a sentence in which our readers will
    see how faithfully Mr. Rawnsley maintains the doctrine of the
    atonement."--_Church of England Magazine._

    "The matter of the Sermons is simple, mostly derived from Holy
    Scripture and the common occurrences of life; and the style is
    plain, yet earnest and affectionate. The practical improvement of
    the hearers seems everywhere to have been kept in
    view."--_Clerical Journal._

Reading without Tears; or, a Pleasant Mode of Learning to Read. By the
Author of "Peep of Day," &c. With numerous Woodcuts. Sixteenth Thousand.
Part I. Square cloth, 2_s._

  *** In this little work the attempt is made, by the classification
  of words, removing all perplexity, to prevent TEARS, and by a
  succession of _pictures_, furnishing constant entertainment, to
  preserve the SMILES of happy childhood while learning to read.

    "That this elementary volume is the work of the authoress of the
    'Peep of Day' will be a sure passport to the hearts of thousands,
    both parents and children. But apart from its authorship, the book
    itself is admirable; the arrangement, pictures, typography, and
    reading exercises being alike adapted to realise the idea of the
    title, learning to read 'without tears.' Teachers are addressed in
    some valuable prefatory remarks. The authoress lays great stress
    on the exclusion of the element of fiction from the narratives
    which she has introduced as lessons."--_Record._

    between the Rationalism of the last generation and the Puritanism

    thou hast been instructed."--_St. Luke._

    "'A Synopsis of the Christian Evidences' would be no untrue title

    accumulation of proofs of the truth of the Bible as we never
    remember to have met with before."--_Christian Observer._

    "Exhibiting much research, the author presents his arguments in a
    clear and forcible manner, and without any personal invective he
    overwhelms with ridicule the deductions which infidels draw from
    scientific evidence. Throughout he preserves a dignified style,
    and while taking great pains to expose the assumption of
    philosophy, he never neglects to attack the lesser, but no less
    mischievous assaults of ignorance. As a valiant champion, our
    author is well armed at all points, and uses his weapons
    dexterously."--_Public Opinion._

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
