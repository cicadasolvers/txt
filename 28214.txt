AN ENCYCLOPAEDIA OF VENTILATION.

    "_The House_ [_of Commons_] _met to-day_ [_27th April_] _after the
    Easter holidays--and honourable members, on entering, seemed highly to
    appreciate the unusual luxury of a little fresh air._"--THE TIMES, 28th
    April.

The failure of some late attempts to ventilate public buildings invites me
to set forth an _Encyclopaedia of ventilation_--at a cheap rate, and in a
compendious form.

Aware of the abilities and celebrity of many of the writers on this
subject--from Whitehurst and Franklin to Reid and Gurney--I must ward off
the imputation of self-conceit by expressing my belief that the errors of
those who have failed should be chiefly ascribed to excessive cleverness;
to unadvised attempts at outwitting nature! I hope to escape that snare. In
the execution of my humble task, I shall entirely rely on common sense and
common experience.

Air is essential to human life, and as respiration destroys its vital
qualities, the _ventilation_ of rooms which are intended for habitation
should be a primary object in all architectural plans.

Architects, however, seldom provide for the ventilation of rooms otherwise
than as they provide for the admission of light. Now the properties of
light and air, with reference to our domestic requirements, differ in some
important particulars--of which it may not be amiss to give a brief
enumeration.

_Light_ moves with uniform velocity: _air_ is sometimes quiescent, and
sometimes moves at the rate of thirty miles an hour. _Light_ diffuses
itself with much uniformity: _air_ passes in a current from the point of
its entrance to that of its exit. _Light_, whatever be its velocity, has no
sensible effect on the human frame: _air_, in the shape of a partial
current, is both offensive to the feelings and productive of serious
diseases. _Light_, once admitted, supplies our wants till nightfall: _air_
requires to be replaced at very short intervals. _Light_ may be
conveniently admitted from above: _air_ requires to be admitted on the
level of the sitter. _Light_, by the aid of ground glass, may be modified
permanently: _air_ requires to be variously adjusted according to its
direction, its velocity, the seasons, the time of the day, the number of
persons assembled, &c.

An attentive consideration of the above circumstances leads me to certain
conclusions which I shall now state aphoristically, and proceed to describe
in more detail.

A room designed for a numerous assemblage of persons--as a reading-room, a
lecture-room, or a school-room--should be provided with apertures, adapted
to admit spontaneous supplies of fresh air, in such variable quantities as
may be required, on at least two of its opposite sides, and within three
feet from the floor; also, with apertures in the ceiling, or on a level
therewith, to promote the exit of the vitiated air. The apertures of both
descriptions may be quite distinct from those which admit light.

Suppose a room to be twenty-four feet square, and sixteen feet in height,
with two apertures for light on each side, each aperture being three feet
wide by eight feet in height, and rising from the floor. There are not many
rooms constructed on a plan so favourable to the admission of fresh
air--but it has some serious defects. 1. The air would enter in broad and
partial currents. 2. It would not reach the angular portions of the room.
3. The vitiated air might rise above the apertures, and so accumulate
without the means of escape.

Now, suppose the same room to have its apertures at eight feet from the
floor, and so to reach the ceiling. The escape of the vitiated air might
then take place--if not prevented by a counter-current. But whence comes
the fresh air for the occupants? There is no direct provision for its
admission. The elevated apertures are utterly insufficient for that
purpose; and _the perpetual requisite is no otherwise afforded than by the
occasional opening of a door!_

It being thus established that the same apertures can never effectually
serve for light and ventilation, I propose with regard to reading-rooms,
lecture-rooms, and school-rooms, which require accommodation for books,
maps, charts, and drawings, rather than a view of external objects, that
the windows should be placed in the upper part of the room--that the
admission of fresh air should be provided for by ducts near the floor--and
the escape of the vitiated air by openings in, or on a level with, the
ceiling.

The number of windows, and their size, must depend on the size of the room.
If windows are to admit light only, a smaller number may be sufficient, and
they may not be required on more than one side; a circumstance which
recommends the plan proposal, as we can seldom have windows on each side of
a room, or even on two of its opposite sides, but may devise a method of so
admitting air.

Rejecting the use of windows as a means of ventilation, and rejecting
artificial currents of every description, I propose the substitution of
air-ducts of incorrodible iron, to be inserted horizontally in the walls of
at least two opposite sides of the room, within three feet from the floor,
and at intervals of about four feet. The ducts to be six or eight inches in
diameter, according to the size of the room. The external orifice of each
duct to be formed of perforated zinc, and the internal orifice, which may
be trumpet-shaped, of {416} perforated zinc or wire-gauze, with a device
which would serve to adjust the quantum of air according to circumstances,
and to exclude it at night. By such contrivances, while the offensive and
noxious currents which proceed from wide openings would be obviated, the
supplies of fresh air would always be equal to the demand. The _purest_ air
may not be accessible--but, as Franklin says, "no common air from without
is so unwholesome as the air within a _close_ room."

The escape of the vitiated air requires less consideration. If the ceiling
of the room be flat, with another room above it, the upper part of each
window, in the shape of a narrow slip, might be made to act as a sort of
safety-valve; but if the windows are on one side only, corresponding
openings should be made on the opposite side, so that there would almost
always be, more or less, a leeward opening. A vaulted ceiling, without any
other room over it, seems to be the most desirable form, as the vitiated
air would rise and collect towards its centre, where there could be no
counter-current to impede its egress.

It is the union of those two objects, the admission of fresh air and the
riddance of the vitiated air, skilfully and economically effected, which
forms the circle of the science of ventilation.

I have restricted myself to the means of _ventilation_, which is requisite
at all seasons of the year, but am quite aware that _warmth_, or a
temperature above that of the external air, is sometimes indispensable to
health and comfort, and therefore to the free exercise of the faculties. I
believe, however, that the means proposed for the admission of fresh air
might also be made available for the admission of heated air, and that
either description of air might be admitted independently of the other, or
both descriptions simultaneously.

A vast increase of reading-rooms, lecture-rooms, and school-rooms, may be
safely predicted, and as the due ventilation of such rooms is a project of
undeniable importance, I hope this note, eccentric in form, but earnest as
to its purpose, may invite the remarks of others more conversant with
architecture and physics--either in correction, or confirmation, or
extension, of its general principles and details.

THE HOUSE OF RUSSELL, OR DU ROZEL.

At a time when the readers of "N. & Q.," and the world at large, have been
hearing of the gift of a bell to a village church in Normandy, so
pleasantly and readily made by the princely house of Russell, far exceeding
the modest solicitation of the cure for assistance by way of a
subscription, in remembrance of the Du Rozels having left their native
patrimony in France to share the fortunes of the Conqueror in Old England,
the following particulars may not be uninteresting.

Mr. Wiffen, when compiling his elaborate _Historical Memoirs of the House
of Russell, from the Time of the Norman Conquest_, had occasion to make
some inquiries respecting a statement put forth by a M. Richard Seguin, a
rich dealer in merceries and wooden shoes at Vire, in the department of
Calvados; who, it appears, had a mania for appropriating the literary
labours of others as his own, and, in fact, is stigmatised as a _voleur
litteraire_ by M. Querard, in his curious work entitled _Les Supercheries
Litteraires Devoilees_. Mr. Wiffen wished to ascertain M. Seguin's
authority for affirming in some work, the name of which is not given by M.
Querard, but which is probably the _Histoire du Pays d'Auge et des Eveques
Comtes de Lisieux_, Vire, 1832, that the Du Rozels were descended from
Bertrand de Briquebec. M. Seguin's reply is contained in the following
letter from M. Le Normand of Vire, to whom Mr. Wiffen had written,
requesting him to obtain M. Seguin's authority for his statement:

    "J'ai vu M. Seguin, et je lui ai demande d'ou provenaient les
    renseignements dont il s'etait servi pour dire dans son ouvrage que les
    Du Rozel descendaient des Bertrand de Bricquebec. _Il m'a repondu qu'il
    l'ignorait_; qu'il avait eu en sa possession une grande quantite de
    Copies de Chartres et d'anciens titres qui lui avaient fourni les
    materiaux de son histoire, _mais qu'il ne savait nullement d'ou elles
    provenaient_."--_Historical Memoirs, &c._, vol. i. p. 5. n. 1.

The fact appears to be, that M. Seguin had obtained possession, through
marriage, of a quantity of MSS., and was in the habit of printing them as
his own works. Some of them had belonged to an Abbe Lefranc, one of the
priests who were murdered in the diabolical massacre of the clergy in the
prisons of Paris in September, 1792; and others of the MSS. had been the
property of a M. Noel Deshayes, Cure de Compigni, whose _Memoires pour
servir a l'Histoire des Eveques de Lisieux_, were published by Seguin as
his own, but altered and disfigured under the title of--

    "Histoire du Pays d'Auge et des Eveques Comtes de Lisieux, contenant
    des Notions sur l'Archeologie, les Droits, Coutumes, Franchises et
    Libertes du Bocage et de la Normandie; Vire, Adam, 1832."

The MS., however, from which Seguin printed his forgery, turns out to have
been but a copy; the original having since been discovered by M. Formeville
in the library of the Seminaire of Evreux, and is now about to be published
by that gentleman (see _Supercheries_, tom. iv., Paris, 1852). By a just
retribution, M. Formeville is one of the literary men to whom Sequin
refused to point out his original authorities. M. Querard quotes some {417}
passages, in juxtaposition, from Seguin's pretended work and from the
original MS., to show how the latter had been altered and corrupted in the
printed copy. M. Seguin was quite illiterate, and has committed the most
egregious blunders in his _chef d'oeuvre de plagiat_, as his _Histoire du
Pays d'Auge_ is termed by Querard. Many other authors, besides Mr. Wiffen
and M. Formeville, wrote to Seguin for his authorities on various subjects,
but he never pointed out a single one. Full details are given of his
literary thefts by M. Querard and his coadjutors. When the original work of
M. Deshayes appears, in its genuine state, as promised by M. Formeville,
the world will then learn what was really stated respecting the descent of
the Du Rozels from Bertrand de Briquebec; although the amiable and
accomplished Mr. Wiffen is no longer living to avail himself of the
information. Seguin died in 1847.

FERDINAND CHARLES III., DUKE OF PARMA.

Englishmen might, perhaps, feel even more horror than they will do at the
assassination, on Mar. 26, of the Duke of Parma, if they were reminded that
he was the representative and lineal descendant of Charles I., and as such
possessed a claim, by hereditary descent, on our Crown, superior to that of
our gracious Queen, who is only lineally descended from James I.

It is rather a singular circumstance, that the Duchess of Parma should have
been the wife of the hereditary heir to the throne of England, and the
sister of the hereditary heir to the throne of France,--her husband, the
Duke of Parma, having been the representative of the House of Stuart,--and
her brother, the Count de Chambord, being the representative of the House
of Bourbon.

ORIGINAL ENGLISH ROYAL LETTERS TO THE GRAND MASTERS OF MALTA.

(_Continued from_ Vol. ix., p. 267.)

Through the great kindness of my old friend at this island, Frederick
Sedley, Esq., and the continued and constant assistance of Dr. Vella, I am
now enabled to forward correct translations of the seven remaining letters
bearing the autograph of Charles II. Mindful of the space which will be
required for their insertion in "N. & Q.," I shall confine myself to a few
preliminary remarks.

The first letter in the following list is the earliest in date, as it is of
the greatest interest. In it we have, for the first time, found a curious
statement recorded by an English monarch, making known that he not only
built his galleys for the protection of trade in this sea in different
ports of the Mediterranean, _and purchased the slaves to man them of the
Order of Malta_, but also complaining to the Grand Master for permitting
the collector of customs to charge an export toll of "five pieces of gold
per head," which he considered an unjust tax on this _kind of commerce_,
and the more especially so, because it was not demanded from his neighbours
and allies, the Kings of France and Spain. That the Knights of St. John
made their prisoners slaves, disposing of some to the wealthy residents or
natives of the island, and employing others in the erection of their
dwellings, palaces, and fortifications, is well known.

Historians have stated that when Dragut landed at Malta, in July, 1551,
with Sinam, his admiral, who was in joint command, they went to the summit
of Mount Sceberras to reconnoitre before an attack should be made on the
convent. When employed on this service, Sinam, who was opposed to any
hostile movement, pointing to the castle, thus remarked, "Surely no eagle
could have chosen a more craggy and difficult place to make his nest in.
Dost thou not see that men must have wings to get up to it, and that all
the artillery and troops of the universe would not be able to take it by
force?" An old Turkish officer of his suite, addressing Dragut, thus
continued,--"See'st thou that bulwark which juts out in the sea, and on
which the Maltese have planted the great standard of their order? I can
assure thee that whilst I was a _prisoner with them, I have helped to carry
the large stones of which it is built_, and am pretty sure that before thou
canst make thyself master of it, thou wilt be overtaken by the winter
season; and probably likewise prevented from succeeding by some powerful
succours from Europe." There can be little doubt that this remark was {418}
feelingly made, and that the aged Turk who uttered it had experienced,
during his residence as a prisoner at Malta, all the horrors of slavery.
That no consideration was given to the comfort of a slave, and little value
set on his life, will be briefly shown by the following anecdote:--On the
13th of April, 1534, an accusation was made against an English knight of
the name of Massimberg, to the effect that he had unwarrantably drawn his
sword and _killed four galley slaves_; and being convicted of the crime on
the 18th of May of the same year, he was asked why judgment should not be
given against him. Massimberg thus replied, "_In killing the four slaves I
did well, but in not having at the same time killed our old and imbecile
Grand Master I did badly._" This plea not being _considered satisfactory_,
he was deprived of his habit; but two days afterwards, that is, on the 20th
May, 1534, he was reinstated in the Order, though for a time not permitted
to enjoy his former dignity of a commander. This knight was also accused of
having stolen a slave from a Maltese; but this accusation he stoutly
denied, giving, in proof of his innocence, that the man _bore on his
shoulder a brand, or mark_, by which he could be easily known as belonging
to him. (Vide Manuscript Records of the Order.)

The next letter in the following list to which I would briefly call
attention is that under date of June 21st, 1675, in which His Majesty
Charles II. refers to a misunderstanding which had taken place between his
admiral, Sir John Narbrough, and the Order of Malta. The nature of this
difficulty is well explained by giving a correct copy of the admiral's
letter to the Grand Master, which I have taken from the original now on
file in the Record Office of this island. It reads as follows:--

    To the most eminent Prince, the Lord Nicholas Cotoner, Grand Master of
    the Order of Malta.

    Most eminent Sir,

    After the tender of my humble service, with my hearty thanks for the
    manifold favours vouchsafed unto my Master, the King of Great Britain,
    &c., and for your highness' extraordinary kindness manifested to
    myself--and, most eminent sir, since your favour of _product_, I have
    sent on shore one of my captains to wait upon your highness with the
    presentment of this my grateful letter, and withal to certify to your
    eminence _that I did, and do expect, a salute to be given by your
    highness to my Master's flag which I carry_, correspondent to the
    salutes which you give to the flags of the King of Spain and the King
    of France, which are carried in the same place, _it being the
    expectation of the King my Master_.

    Formerly your eminence was pleased to make some scruple of my command
    as admiral, which I humbly conceive your highness is fully satisfied
    in, since you received the last letter from the King of Great Britain.

    Sir, I have, since my arrival at your eminence's port, often employed
    the Consul Desclaous to wait upon your highness _concerning the
    salutes_, but have not received any satisfactory answer thereto, which
    I now humbly desire may be returned unto me by my officer; and withal,
    that your eminence will be pleased to honour me with your commands
    wherein I may serve you, which shall be most cheerfully embraced, and
    readily performed by,

      Most eminent Sir,
      Your highness' most humble
      And faithful Servant,
      JOHN NARBROUGH.

      On board His Majesty's Ship Henrietta,
      Malta, October 17, 1675.

That the complaints of Sir John Narbrough, with reference to the Grand
Master's refusal to salute the English flag, were, in the end,
satisfactorily explained and removed, will be seen by the following
extracts taken from the _Diary of Henry Teonge_, published in London in
1825. The reverend writer was serving as chaplain on board H. M. S.
"Assistance" at the time (1675-76) his notes were written.

    "_August 1, 1675._--This morn wee com near Malta; before wee com to the
    cytty, a boate with the Malteese flagg in it coms to us to know whence
    wee cam. Wee told them from England; they asked if wee had a bill of
    health for prattick, viz., entertaynment; our captain told them he had
    _no bill but what was in his guns' mouths_. Wee cam on and anchored in
    the harbour betweene the old towne and the new, about nine of the
    clock; but must waite the governour's leasure to have leave to com on
    shoare, which was detarded _because our captain would not salute the
    cytty, except they would retaliate_. At last cam the Consull with his
    attendants to our ship (but would not com on board till our captain had
    been on shoare) to tell us that we had leave to com on shoare six, or
    eight, or ten, at a time, and might have anything that was there to be
    had; _with a promise to accept our salute kindly_. Wherupon our captain
    tooke a glasse of sack, and drank a health to King Charles, and fyred
    seven gunns: the cytty gave us five againe, which was more than they
    had don to all our men of warr that cam thither before."

    "_August 2._--This cytty is compassed almost cleane round with the sea,
    which makes severall safe harbours for hundreds of shipps. The people
    are generally extreamly courteouse, but especially to the English. A
    man cannot demonstrate all their excellencys and ingenuitys. Let it
    suffice to say thus much of this place: viz. Had a man no other
    business to invite him, yet it were sufficiently worth a man's cost and
    paines to make a voyage out of England on purpose to see that noble
    cytty of Malta, and their works and fortifications about it. Several of
    their knights and cavaliers cam on board us, six at one time, men of
    sufficient courage and friendly carriage, wishing us {419} good
    successe in our voyage, with whom I had much discourse, I being the
    only entertainer, because I could speak Latine; for which I was highly
    esteemed, and much invited on shoare again."

    "_August 3._--This morning a boate of ladys with their musick to our
    ship syd, and bottels of wine with them. They went severall times about
    our ship, and sang several songs very sweetly; very rich in habitt, and
    very courteous in behaviour; but would not com on board, though
    invited; but having taken their friscs, returned as they cam. After
    them cam, in a boate, four fryars, and cam round about our ship, puld
    off their hatts and capps, saluted us with congjes, and departed. After
    them cam a boat of musitians, playd severall lessons as they rowed
    gently round about us, and went their way."

    "_August 4._--This morning our captain was invited to dine with the
    Grand Master, which hindered our departure. In the mean time wee have
    severall of the Malteese com to visit us, all extreamly courteous. And
    now wee are preparing to sail for Tripoly. Deus vortat bene.

      "Thus wee, th' 'Assistance,' and the new Sattee,
      Doe steare our course poynt blanke for Trypoly;
      Our ship new rigged, well stord with pigg, and ghoose a,
      Henns, ducks, and turkeys, and wine cald Syracoosa."

The Rev. Mr. Teonge, having returned to Malta on the 11th of January,
1675-6, thus continues:--

    "This morning wee see the famous island of Malta; coming under Goza, a
    small island adjoyning to Malta, wee discover a sayle creeping closse
    to the shoare; we hayle her with a shott--she would not budge; we sent
    a second, and then a third, falling very neare her; then the
    leiuetenant cam aboard us, and payd for the shott; it proved a
    pittifull Frenchman."

    "_January 12._--A little after one a clock wee are at anchor in Malta
    harbour, _and have many salutes_. But we have no prattick by reason of
    the plague, which is begun heare."

    "_January 15._--This morning wee warp out of the harbour with six
    merchantmen and a doggar, which wee are to convoy towards the strait's
    mouth. Here also wee took in two mounths' provisions and fresh water.
    And as wee goe out wee meete six gallys of Malta coming in in all their
    pompe, and they salute us, and wee them, and part. And heare at Malta
    (which was very strainge to mee), at this time of the year, wee have
    radishes, cabbiges, and excellent colly flowers, and large ones for a
    penny a-piece."

On the 29th January, 1675-6, the reverend writer again returned to Malta,
and made under this date the following note:--

    "This day David Thomas and Marlin, the coock, and our master's boy, had
    their hands stretched out, and with their backs to the rayles, and the
    master's boy with his back to the maine mast, all looking one upon the
    other, and in each of their mouths a mandler spike, viz., an iron pinn
    clapt closse into their mouths, and tyd behind their heads; and there
    they stood a whole houre, till their mouths were very bloody, _an
    excellent cure for swearers_."

    "_February 4._--This day dined with us Sir Roger Strickland, Captaine
    Temple, Captaine Harrice, and one gentleman more. Wee had a gallant
    baked pudding, an excellent legg of porke, and colliflowers, an
    excellent dish made of piggs' petti-toes, two roasted piggs, one turkey
    cock, a rosted hogg's head, three ducks, a dish of Cyprus burds, and
    pistachoes and dates together, and store of good wines."

    "_February 5._--God blesse those that are at sea! The weather is very
    bad."

    "_February 11._--Sir John Narbrough cam in from Trypoly, and four more
    ships with him. The noble Malteese _salute him with forty-five gunns_;
    he answers them with so many that I could not count them. And what with
    our salutes, and his answers, there was nothing but fyre and smoake for
    almost two hours."

The great length of this communication prevents my taking other extracts
from a "Diary" which contains much interesting information, and is written
in a quaint and humorous style.

Minor Notes.

_Whipping a Lady._--The following is from a MS. Diary of the Rev. John
Lewis, Rector of Chalfield and Curate of Tilbury:

    "August, 1719. Sir Christopher Hales being jilted by a lady who
    promised him marriage, and put him off on the day set for their
    marriage, gave her a good whipping at parting. Remember the story."

Is there any corroboration of this?

_Mother of Thirty Children._--An instance has come under my notice of a
woman, whose maiden name was Lee, born in Surrey; married, first, Berry,
with whom she lived thirty years, and had twenty-six children (four times
twins): all survived infancy. Married, secondly, Taylor, by whom she had
four children. Died at Stratford, aged eighty-four. Within a few weeks of
her death, was as upright as a young woman. At the time of her death, there
were one hundred and twenty-two of her descendants living. She lived most
of her married life near Whitechapel and Radcliffe, and was buried in the
Brickfield burying-ground. She had sixteen boys and fourteen girls.

LEYTON.

_"Ought" and "Aught."_--I regret to observe that _ought_ is gradually
supplanting _aught_ in our language, where the meaning intended to be
conveyed is "anything." Todd's _Johnson_ gives authorities, but may they
not be errors of the press? I am aware that use has substituted _nought_
for _naught_ in the sense of "not anything", the latter now expressing only
what is "bad," and convenience may justify that change, _nought_ being not
otherwise used. Let me add that I am the more {420} in fear for our old
servant _aught_, who surely has done _nought_ worthy of excommunication,
from observing that such a writer as the Rev. Chevenix Trench has
substituted _ought_ for _aught_ to express "anything." If convenience is
allowed to justify our having _nought_ and _naught_, it surely claims that
we should keep _aught_ and _ought_ each for its appropriate signification
in writing, impossible as it is to distinguish one from the other in
speech.

_Walton._--The following note is written on the fly-leaf at the end of
Hieron's _Sermons_, 1620:

    "Mr. Gillamour.--I pray you be entreated to lend my wife what silver
    you think fittest upon this or other bookes to supplie our present
    wants, soe as I may have them againe when I restore it to you; you
    shall doo mee a greate curtesie, and I shall be very thankfull to you.

I have no information as to either party, and no date is affixed to the
request.

_Salutations._--The parting salutations of various nations are strikingly
alike. The _vale_ of the Latins corresponds with the [Greek: chaire] of the
Greeks; and though Deity is not expressed distinctly in either, it was
doubtless understood: for who can be kept in health without, as the
ancients would say, the will of the gods? The Greek word perhaps has a
higher signification than the Latin; for it was not a mere complimentary
salutation, says Macknight: "St. John forbids it to be given to heretical
teachers, Eph. ii. 10, 11." The French, on taking leave, say "Adieu," thus
distinctly recognising the providential power of the Creator; and the same
meaning is indeed conveyed in our English word, "good-bye," which is
corruption of "God be with you." The Irish, in their warmth of manner and
love of words, often extend the expression. A well-known guide, upon my
leaving one of the loveliest spots in Wicklow, shook hands with me
heartily, and said, in a voice somewhat more tremulous through age than it
was when Tom Moore loved to listen to it: "God Almighty bless you, be with
you, and guide you safely to your journey's end!" This salutation, when
used thoughtfully and aright, has not only a pleasant sound, but deep
meaning.

_Good Times for Equity Suitors._--Having lately met with the following
particulars in Bishop Goodman's _Diary_, I send them for insertion, if you
think fit, in "N. & Q.:"

    "Then was the chancery so empty of causes, that Sir Thomas More could
    live in Chelsea, and yet very sufficiently discharge that office; and
    coming one day home by ten of the clock, whereas he was wont to stay
    until eleven or twelve, his lady came down to see whether he was sick
    or not; to whom Sir Thomas More said, 'Let your gentlewoman fetch me a
    cup of wine, and then I will tell you the occasion of my coming;' and
    when the wine came, he drank to his lady, and told her that he thanked
    God for it he had not one cause in chancery, and therefore came home
    for want of business and employment there. The gentlewoman who fetched
    the wine told this to a bishop, who did inform me."

_The Emperor of Russia and the Order of the Garter._--The Emperor of Russia
is a knight of the Order of the Garter. Now, according to the statutes of
the Order, no knight ought to take up arms against another, or in any way
assist anybody so to do.

In illustration of this, we find it stated in Anstis' _Register of the Most
Noble Order of the Garter_, who quotes from Caligula, L. 6., in _Bib.
Cott._, that when the French king wished to borrow a sum of money from
Henry VII., to employ in the war with the King of Naples, the answer was:

    "Que le Roy ne povoit avec son honneur bailler aide et assistence a
    icelluy son bon frere et cousin a l'encontre du Roy de Naples, qui
    estoit son confrere et allye, veu et considere qu'il avoit prise et
    recue l'ordre de la garretiere. Et si le roi autrement faisoit, ce
    seroit contrevenir au serment qu'il a fait par les statuz du dit

SIR HENRY WOTTON'S VERSES, "THE CHARACTER OF A HAPPY LIFE."

Owing to the almost perfect identity of these verses with some by a German
poet, George Rudolph Weckerlin, a doubt has been expressed in a German work
as to whether they are to be considered the production of Sir Henry Wotton,
or a translation from the _Geistliche und weltliche Gedichte_ of Weckerlin,
a lyrical poet of considerable eminence and popularity in his day, and who
died in London in 1651. Weckerlin was employed in important affairs
connected with the Protestants in Germany during the Thirty Years' War, as
secretary to an embassy in London from that country; and was also employed
on several occasions by James I. and Charles I. An edition of Weckerlin's
_Poems_ was edited by him while he resided in London, and was printed at
Amsterdam in 1641, and again in 1648. A previous collection had {421}
appeared at Stutgart in 1618. Many of his poems, which he had left in MS.
with his brother Ludwig in Germany, perished with him during the horrors of
the war. "What has become," Weckerlin feelingly exclaims, "of my _Myrta_,
that dear poem, composed of so many sonnets and stanzas?"

Perhaps some of the readers of "N. & Q.," who are conversant with the
literature of England and Germany during the period alluded to, may be able
to solve the question as to the real author of the verses mentioned.

bounds of possibility, if we are to believe the Parish Register of
Bermondsey; for there appears an entry there of the marriage, on Jan. 4,
1624-5, of James Harriott, Esq., one of the _forty_ children of his father.
I myself knew intimately a lady, a clergyman's widow, who was the mother of
twenty-six children (Vol. v., p. 106.; Vol. ix., p. 186.); and I have heard
it said that one of her brothers-in-law was father of twenty-four, and
another of fourteen children. The late Sir Robert Wigram, Bart., had
twenty-four children: he died at the age of eighty-six.

    twenty-two children; by his second wife, Miss Brodrick, daughter of Dr.
    Brodrick, a Brother of Lord Midleton's, Mr. Bathurst had a second
    family of fourteen children, of whom my father was third child and
    second son. He was a seven months' child, and I have heard that he was
    so extremely small an infant, that he could not be dressed like other
    children for some time after his birth, but was obliged to be wrapped
    in cotton. My father used to say in a joke, that he was wrapped in

F. M. MIDDLETON.

    [A diversity of opinion prevails as to the exact import of this term.
    The great musical critic Mattheson, in a work written on the word,
    having rejected eleven meanings, decides in favour of the twelfth,
    which makes the word equivalent to the modern Italian _da capo_. In
    this view, the word _selah_ directs a repetition of the air or song
    from the commencement, to the parts where it is placed. Herder held
    that _selah_ denoted a swell, or a change in the rapidity of the
    movement, or in the key. The Easterns, he says, are fond of a very
    uniform, and, as it appears to Europeans, mournful music; but at
    certain points, they of a sudden change the key, and pass into a
    different melody. These points, he thinks, were among the Hebrews
    indicated by the word _selah_. The balance of authority, however, is in
    favour of the former view.--_The People's Dict. of the Bible._ Consult
    also, Julius Bate's _Critica Hebraea_, and Gesenius' _Hebrew and

ADDISON'S HYMNS.

(Vol. ix., p. 373.)

After the correspondence that took place ("N. & Q.," Vol. v.), I had hoped
that Addison would have been left in peaceable possession of those "divine
hymns" ascribed to his pen; but this is not to be. A former correspondent,
J. G. F., doubted whether they were not composed by Andrew Marvell? This
inquiry was, I hope, satisfactorily answered, by myself in the first
instance, and afterwards by MR. CROSSLEY, Vol. v., pp. 513, 548.

In No. 234. a later correspondent, S. M., asks whether the hymn "When
rising from the bed of death," which he says is "taken from the chapter on
'Death and Judgment,' in Addison's _Evidences of the Christian Religion_,"
was written by Addison or Dr. Isaac Watts? In what edition of the
_Evidences_ does S. M. find either the chapter he speaks of, or this hymn?
The place which it occupies is in No. 513. of the _Spectator_. As I have
elsewhere stated, Addison was accustomed to throw a little mystery over
these poems; and "the excellent man in holy orders," to whom this hymn is
attributed, is unquestionably the ideal clergyman, the occasional visitor
of the club, spoken of in the second number of the _Spectator_.

In the letter that accompanies this hymn, the supposed writer says,--

    "The indisposition which has long hung upon me, is at last grown to
    such a head, that it must quickly make an end of me or of itself....
    Were I able to dress up several thoughts of a serious nature, which
    have made great impressions on my mind during a long fit of sickness,
    they might not be an improper entertainment for one of your Saturday's
    papers."

What a natural remark from a writer who, Addison tells us, treats divine
topics "as one who has no interests in this world, as one who is hastening
to the object of all his wishes, and conceives hope from his decays and
infirmities!" This sublime paper, or "series of thoughts," stamped with the
peculiar beauties and polish of Addison's style, closes with the hymn in
question, composed, as the writer says, "during this my sickness."

Watts survived the date of this paper above thirty-five years. Had it been
his own composition, would he not have claimed the authorship, and
incorporated the hymn amongst his sacred songs?

Let us not, in the pages of "N. & Q." at least, witness farther attempts to
misappropriate the writings of one, whose undying fame will be
cotemporaneous with the literature of England. Still, in the beautiful
language of Addison's friend Tickell, may he in his hymns--

      ----"warn poor mortals left behind,
  A task well suited to his gentle mind."

LONGFELLOW.

(Vol. ix., pp. 174. 255.)

A communication from a gentleman, who married into a family of this name,
informs me that the Longfellows of Brecon were a branch of a Yorkshire
family; and that a portion of more than one family, probably from the same
county, are now settled in Kent. My friend has not before had his attention
turned to this subject, but he promises farther inquiry.

T. S. N.

Bermondsey.

Why should W. P. STORER suppose that the name of Longfellow originated
otherwise than in the lengthy proportions of an ancestor? Surely the
well-known surnames, Rufus, Longshanks, Strongbow, are sufficient to
warrant us in saying that Longfellow need have nothing to do with
Longueville. From what shall we derive the names of Longman, Greathead,
Littlejohn, and Tallboy?

JOHN P. STILWELL.

Dorking.

By the kindness of the Registrar-General, I am enabled to point, with some
precision, to a few of the localities in which the name of Longfellow
exists in this country. Upon reference to the well-arranged indexes in his
office, it appears that the deaths of sixty-one persons bearing this name
were recorded in the years 1838 to 1852; and of these, fifty occurred in
the West Riding of Yorkshire, namely, in Leeds thirty-five; Otley, and its
neighbourhood, ten; Selby four, and in Keighley one. The other instances
were, in the metropolis seven, and one each in Swansea, Newport (Monmouth),
Tewkesbury, and Hastings. More than one third of the males bore the
Christian name of William.

It is not probable that the Longfellows are numerous in any part of
England: indeed, as we {425} know that of the general population the
average annual mortality is 2.2 per cent, the sixty-one deaths in fifteen
years, or four deaths yearly, might be supposed to result from about two
hundred persons of the name; but inferences of this nature, except when
large masses are dealt with, are often very fallacious.

May not the derivation of the name be from _long fallow_, of the same
family as Fallows, Fellowes, Fallowfield, and Langmead, which are not
uncommon?

C. H. quotes some lines said to have been written on a window-shutter of
the "Golden Lion," Brecon, when a Mr. Longfellow was proprietor, fifty or
sixty years ago:

  "Tom Longfellow's name is most justly his due;
  Long his neck, long his bill, which is very long too;
  Long the time ere your horse to the stable is led," &c.

These lines remind me of the following passage of the poet Longfellow's in
his _Hyperion_, which, not to speak of a possible plagiarism, has at least
a strange _family_ resemblance:

    "If you go to Zurich, beware how you stop at 'The Raven.' I wrote in
    the travellers' book--

      'Beware of the Raven of Zurich;
        'Tis a bird of omen ill,
      With a noisy and an unclean breast,
        And a very, very long bill.'

    "If you go to 'The Golden Falken' you will find it there. I am the
    author of those lines--LONGFELLOW."

BOOKS BURNT BY THE HANGMAN.

(Vol. ix., pp. 78. 226.)

As the subject is interesting, you will probably permit me to cite a few
more examples:--In Geo. Chalmers' _Catalogue_, "Burnt by the hangman" is
appended to a copy of Wm. Thomas' _Historie of Italie_, 1549; but I do not
find this stated elsewhere. The opinions emitted in this work are of a free
nature certainly, in respect to the governed and governing powers; but
whatever was the fate of his book, I rather think Thomas (who was executed
in Mary's reign) suffered for some alleged act of overt treason, and not
for publishing seditious books. _An Information from the States of the
Kingdome of Scotland to the Kingdome of England, showing how they have bin
dealt with by His Majesty's Commissioners_, 1640: in a proclamation (March
30, 1640) against seditious pamphlets sent from Scotland, this tract was
prohibited on account of its containing many most notorious falsehoods,
scandals, &c.; it was ordered to be burnt by the common hangman. (Rymer's
_Foed._, as quoted by Chalmers.)

There is now before me a modern impression of an old cut in two
compartments: the upper representing the demolition of the "Crosse in
Cheapeside on the 2nd May, 1643;" and the lower a goodly gathering of the
public around a bonfire, viewing, with apparent satisfaction, the committal
of a book to the flames by the common executioner, with this inscription:

    "10th May, the Boocke of Spartes vpon the Lord's Day, was burnt by the
    hangman in the place where the Crosse stoode, and at (the) Exchange."

That great lover of sights, Master Pepys, notices one of these exhibitions:

    "1661, 28th May, with Mr. Shipley," says our gossip, "to the Exchange
    about business; and there, by Mr. Rawlinson's favour, got into a
    balcone over against the Exchange, and there saw the hangman burn, by
    vote of Parliament, two old acts: the one for constituting us a
    Commonwealth, and the other I have forgot; which still do make me think
    of the greatness of this late turne, and what people will do to-morrow
    against what they all, thro' profit or fear, did promise and practise
    this day."

A note to this passage in the _Diary_ (vol. i. p. 236., 3rd edit.) supplies
the defective memory of Pepys, by informing us that the last was an "Act
for subscribing the Engagement;" and adds, on the same day there had been
burnt by the hangman, at Westminster Hall, the "Act for erecting a High
Court of Justice for trying and judging Charles Stuart." They seem to have
been just then cleansing out the Augean stable of the Commonwealth: for it
is added, "two more acts" were similarly burnt next day.

against high churchmen, reminds the preacher that he--

    "Was pleased to dress up the principles of the Presbyterians in a
    frightful shape; but let me tell you, Sir, in my turn, that the
    principles of your party have been burnt, not by a rude and lawless
    rabble, but by the common hangman, in broad day-light, before the Royal
    Exchange in London, and by authority of Parliament. Perhaps," he
    continues, "you never heard of this contemptuous treatment of the
    Oxford principles, and therefore I will give it you from the
    Parliamentary Records:--'Anno Domini 1710. The House of Lords, taking
    into consideration the judgment and decree of the University of Oxford,
    passed in their Convocation July 21, 1683,--it was resolved by the
    Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament assembled, that the said
    judgment and decree contains in it several positions contrary to the
    Constitution of this kingdom, and destructive to the Protestant
    Succession as by law established. And it was thereupon ordered, by the
    Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament assembled, that the said
    judgment and decree shall be burnt by the hands of the common hangman
    before the Royal {426} Exchange, between hours of twelve and one, on
    Monday the 17th March, in the presence of the Lord Mayor of the City of
    London,' &c."

Doleman's _Conference about the next Succession to the Crown of England_,
reprinted at N. with licence, in 1681, was, in 1683, condemned by the
University of Oxford, and burnt by the common hangman.

In the above examples I have confined myself to those books, &c. only which
were expressly consigned to the flames by the hangman. The instances of
book-burning where this indignity was either not imposed, or its infliction
not recorded, are numerous. Among the curiosities of literature of
Elizabeth's reign, were certain books ascribed to a Dutchman, by name Henry
Nicholas, translated into English, and probably imported from the Low
Countries. This person, imbibing the "damnable heresies" of David George,
of Leyden, became the apostle of a sect who styled themselves "The Family
of Love," and their fanatical books becoming obnoxious to the dominant
party, they were, by proclamation, ordered to be burnt; and, as such
manifestations of the royal will usually ran, all persons were held
punishable for having them in their possession. (See Herbert's _Ames._) As
an example of the spiritual power thus dealing with a book, apparently upon
its own authority, the following may be offered:--_Servetus de Trinitate,
&c._ (London, 1723.) This edition, which is without name of place or
printer, and without date, was printed by Palmer for Osborne the
bookseller; but, as soon as completed was seized at the instance of Dr.
Gibson, Bishop of London, and burnt, with the exception of a very few
copies. (Davis' _Journey round the Library, &c._) The last unfortunate book
I shall mention is the _Metrical Psalms_ of Dod; which was also, most
likely, an episcopal seizure. Mr. Holland, in his _Psalmists of Britain_,
quoting from George Withers' _Scholler's Purgatory_, says, "Dod the
silkman's late ridiculous translation of the Psalms was, by authority,
worthily condemned to the fire," and, judging from its extreme scarcity, I
should say very few escaped.

I have not seen in your list of martyred books the following, in the year
A.D. 1684: _A Plea for the Nonconformists_, by Thomas De Laune, Gentleman.
He died in Newgate, during his imprisonment for the book, in pursuance of
the following sentence:

    "Ad General. Quartercal. Session. Pacis Dom. Regis tent. pro Civitat.
    London per adjornament, apud Justice-hall in le Old Bayly, die Mercurii
    Scil. Decimo Sexto die January, Anno Regis Caroli Secundi cundi nunc
    Ang. &c.

    "Thomas De Laune Convict. pro illicite Scribend. Imprimend. et
    Publicand. Libel. Seditios. dert. concernen. librum Communis
    praecationis. Fin. 100 Marc. Et committit, etc.! Et ulterius quousq;
    Inven. bon. de se bene gerend. per spacium Unius Anni Integri ex tunc
    prox. sequen. Et quad libel. sedit. cum igne Combust. sint apud
    Excambium Regal. in London, et si Del. Sol. 5 shil. WAGSTAFFE."

In a letter containing a narrative of his trial and imprisonment, written
by him from prison, occur many touches of humour. In his remarks on the
sentence he says,--

    "The six shillings to be paid on my discharge is to the hangman, for
    the faggots, I suppose."

    "The Court told us that, in respect to our education as scholars, we
    should not be pillory'd, though ('twas said) we deserved it.... We were
    sent back to our confinement, and _the next execution-day_ our books
    were burnt WITH FIRE (not with water, you must note), and we continue
    here; but, since I writ this, Mr. Ralphson had a supersedeas by _death_
    to a _better place_!"

In his account he affirms that, on his own confession of being the author
of _The Plea_, and because he could find no bail, he was committed to
Newgate--

    "Lodged among the felons, whose horrid company made a perfect
    representation of that horrible place which you describe when you
    mention hell. A hard bench was my bed, and two bricks my pillow. But
    after two days and nights, _without any refreshment_, the unusualness
    of that society and place having impaired my health, which at the very
    best is tender, and crazy, I was removed, and am now in the press-yard,
    a _place of some sobriety_, though still a prison _ubi nihil amabile
    est_!"

Twenty years after, 1704, his Plea was republished, with his narrative, by
one of his fellow-prisoners, who had been released, and who calls it "an
elaborate piece"! He adds, that De Laune, being unable to pay

    "the seventy-five pound, his children, his wife, and himself were
    imprison'd, and _all_ dy'd in New-gate; of which myself was an
    eye-witness, and a companion with him for the same cause in the same
    prison, where I continued above a year after his death."

E. F. WOODMAN.

P. S.--Query, What is the meaning, in the foregoing, of the expression "at
the next execution-day"? Have we any instance on record of the execution of
a malefactor in front of the Royal Exchange? and, if not, did the hangman
come from Newgate, after "doing duty" there, and burn the book at the
Exchange?

In 1611 the books of Conrad Vorstius were publicly burnt in St. Paul's
Churchyard and both the universities by the king's order. (Wilson's _Life
and Reign of James I._, p. 120.)

On Sunday, November 21, 1613, the books of Francis Suarez, the Spanish
Jesuit, were publicly burnt at St. Paul's Cross. (_Court and Times of James
I._, vol. i. pp. 279, 280.)

SACK.

(Vol. ix., p. 272.)

With respect to the wines called Sacks, much diversity of opinion has
prevailed, and although the question has been frequently discussed, it
still remains, in a great measure, undetermined. It seems admitted, on all
hands, that the term _sack_ was originally applied to certain growths of
Spain. In a MS. account of the disbursements by the chamberlain of the city
of Worcester for 1592, Dr. Percy found the ancient mode of spelling to be
_seck_, and thence concluded that sack is a corruption of _sec_, signifying
a dry wine. Moreover, in the French version of a proclamation for
regulating the prices of wines, issued by the privy Council in 1633, the
expression _vins secs_ corresponds with the word _sacks_ in the original.
The term _sec_ is still used as a substantive by the French to denote a
Spanish wine; and the dry wine of Xerez is known at the place of its growth
by the name of _vino seco_. The foregoing account is abridged from _The
History of Ancient and Modern Wines_, by Alex. Henderson, Lond. 1824. The
following is taken from Cyrus Redding's _History of Modern Wines_, Lond.
1833:

    "In the early voyages to these islands (the Canaries), quoted in
    Ashley's collection, there is a passage relative to sack, which will
    puzzle wise heads about that wine. It is under the head of 'Nicols'
    Voyage.' Nicols lived eight years in the islands. The island of
    Teneriffe produces three sorts of wine, Canary, Malvasia, and Verdona,
    'which may all go under the denomination of sack.' The term then was
    applied neither to sweet nor dry wines exclusively, but to Canary,
    Xeres (_i. e._ sherry), or Malaga generally. In Anglo-Spanish
    dictionaries of a century and a quarter old, sack is given as _Vino de
    Canarias_. Hence it was Canary sack, Xeres sack, or Malaga sack."

[Greek: Halieus].

Dublin.

In reply to your correspondent, I believe sack to be nothing but _vino
secco_, dry wine, probably identical with sherry or madeira. I once, when
an undergraduate at Oxford, ordered a dozen from a travelling agent to a
London wine merchant, probably from Shakspearian associations, and my
belief is that what he sold me under that name was an Italian wine of some
sort, bearing a good deal of resemblance to the _vino panto_, of which
Perugia is the head-quarters.

B. D.

This is the same wine which is now named sherry. Falstaff calls it _sherris
sack_, and also _sherris_ only, using in fact both names indiscriminately
(2 _Henry IV._, Act IV. Sc. 3.). For various commentaries regarding it, see
Blount's _Glossographia_; Dr. Venner's _Via recta ad Vitam longam_,
published in 1637; Nares' _Glossary_, &c. Cotgrave, in his _Dictionary_,
makes sack to be derived from _vin sec_, French; and it is called _seck_ in
an article by Bishop Percy, from an old account-book at Worcester, anno
Elizbethae 34.

IRISH LAW IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.

(vol. ix., p. 270.)

What has been mistaken by your correspondent for a piece of Irish
barbarity, was, until the Act 12 Geo. III. c. 20., the usual punishment
awarded by the law to culprits standing mute upon an arraignment of felony
(that is, without speaking at all, or without putting himself upon God and
the country). The judgment in such case was:

    "That the man or woman should be remanded to the prison, and laid there
    in some low and dark room, where they should lie naked on the bare
    earth, without any litter, rushes, or other clothing, and without any
    garment about them, but something to cover their privy parts, and that
    they should lie upon their backs, their heads uncovered and their feet,
    and one arm to be drawn to one quarter of the room with a cord, and the
    other arm to another quarter, and in the same manner to be done with
    their legs; and there should be laid upon their bodies iron and stone,
    so much as they might bear, and more; and the next day following, to
    leave three morsels of barley bread without any drink, and the second
    day to drink thrice of the water next to the house of the prison
    (except running water), without any bread; and this to be their diet
    until they were dead. So as, upon the matter, they should die three
    manner of ways, by weight, by famine, and by cold. And the reason of
    this terrible judgment was because they refused to stand to the common
    law of the land."--2 _Inst._ 178, 179.

In the Year-Book of 8 Henry IV. the form of the judgment is _first_ given.
The Marshal of the King's Bench is ordered to put the criminals into
"diverses measons bases et estoppes, que ils gisent par la terre touts nuds
forsque leurs braces, que ils mettroit sur chascun d'eux tants de fer et
poids quils puissent porter et plus," &c., (as above).

It appears also, from Barrington's _Observations on the Statutes_, that,
until the above-mentioned act, it was usual to torture a prisoner by tying
his thumbs tightly together with whipcord in order to extort a plea; and he
mentions the following instances where one or more of these barbarous
cruelties have been inflicted:

    "In 1714 a prisoner's thumbs were thus tied at the same place" (Old
    Bailey), "who then pleaded; and in January, 1720, William Spigget
    submitted in the same manner after the thumbs being tied _as usual_,
    and his accomplice, Phillips, was absolutely pressed for a considerable
    time, till he begged to stand on his trial. In April, 1720, Mary
    Andrews continued so obstinate, that three whipcords were broken before
    she would plead. In December, 1721, Nathanael Haws suffered in the same
    manner by squeezing the thumbs; after {428} which he continued under
    the press for seven minutes with 250 lbs., and then submitted."

Barrington also says in the text:

    "As it is very unusual for criminals to stand mute on their trials in
    more modern days, and it was not unfrequent, if we go some centuries
    back in English History, it may not be improper to observe, that the
    occasion of its being then more common, was to prevent forfeitures, and
    involving perhaps innocent children in their parents' guilt. These
    forfeitures only accrued upon judgment of _life and limb_, and, to the
    disgrace of the crown, were too frequently levied with the utmost
    rigour. The sentence, however, hath continued to be put into execution
    till the late Act of Parliament (12 Geo. III. c. 20.) properly
    abolished it."

He mentions two other cases, one of which happened at the Sussex assizes,
under Baron Thompson, and the other at Cambridge, in 1741, when Baron
Carter was the judge. I do not think there are any more modern instances
than these, for they are the only ones cited by counsel in General Picton's
case, in justification of inflicting torture on a prisoner. (_State
Trials_, vol. xxx.) The Marquis Beccaria, in an exquisite piece of
raillery, has proposed this problem with a gravity and precision truly
mathematical:

    "The force of the muscles and the sensibility of the nerves of an
    innocent person being given, it is required to find the degree of pain
    necessary to make himself guilty of a given crime."--_1 Bl. Com. 327.
    n._

A prisoner standing mute at the present day would be sentenced to undergo
the punishment that would be awarded to him, if found guilty of the crime
laid to his charge.

INVESTIGATOR.

Manchester, April 4, 1854.

Blackstone (book iv. chap. 25.) speaks of the cases in which punishment of
"peine forte et dure" was inflicted according to the ancient law. It would
occupy too great space to quote what he says on this point, and, therefore
I must refer your correspondent to his work itself, where he will also find
an inquiry into its origin. The punishment is described almost in the words
of your correspondent's quotation; thus:

    "That the prisoner be remanded to the prison from whence he came, and
    be put into a low, dark chamber; and there be laid on his back, on the
    bare floor, naked, unless where decency forbids, that there be placed
    upon his body as great a weight of iron as he could bear, and more;
    that he have no sustenance, save only, on the first day, three morsels
    of the worst bread, and, on the second day, three draughts of standing
    water, that should be nearest to the prison door; and in this situation
    this should be alternately his daily diet, _till he died_, or (as
    anciently the judgment ran) till he answered."

Blackstone farther intimates that this punishment was abolished by statute
12 Geo. III. c. 20., which shows, of course, that it continued to be
according to law for more than thirty years after the date mentioned by
ABHBA.

R. O.

The punishment, or more properly torture, alluded to by ABHBA, was the
"peine forte et dure," commonly applied in the early part of the last
century to such criminals as refused to plead. Many died under it in order
to save their estates, &c. from forfeiture to the crowns. In my forthcoming
anecdotes of "The Eighteenth Century," several cases are cited from the
newspapers of the time; but, as the MS. is now in the printer's hands, I
cannot refer to them. Writing from memory, I think that the last case in
which this torture was applied at the Old Bailey in London was in 1735, and
reported in the _London Magazine_ of that year. The "Press-yard" at Newgate
derives its name from being the scene of these tortures.

JOB XIX. 26.

(Vol. ix., p. 303.)

Perhaps the best mode in which I can comply with MR. C. MANSFIELD INGLEBY'S
request, is to send for insertion in the "N. & Q." my MS. note on the text
in question:

  [Hebrew: W'CHR `WRY NQPW Z'T]
  [Hebrew: WMBSHRY 'CHZH 'LWH:]

The difficulties which the reader experiences, on reading the authorised
version of this passage, are by no means trifling. Every one knows that the
words printed in _Italics_ are not to be found in the original; the
strictly literal rendering, according to the construction put upon the
verse by our translators, would therefore run thus:

  "And after my skin, destroy this,
  Yet in my flesh shall I see God."

To say the least of it, "it is hard to be understood." The three words in
Italics, arbitrarily introduced, make the passage by no means more
intelligible.

The erudite author of the marginal readings (see "N. & Q.," Vol. ix., p.
108.) felt the difficulty, and therefore proposed another translation,
which is,--

  "After I shall awake, though this _body_ be destroyed,
  Yet out of my flesh shall I see God."

By an effort of violent criticism, [Hebrew: `WRY] might be translated _my
awaking_; but it will require an extraordinary critical mind to turn
[Hebrew: NQPW Z'T] into _though this body be destroyed_.

The difficulties seem to have originated with the misapprehension of the
proper meaning of the verb [Hebrew: NQP] here. Instead of translating it
according to its primitive signification, viz. _to surround_ {429} a
foreign sense has been palmed upon it, viz. _to destroy_. Job, no doubt,
meant to say thus:

  "And after my skin has returned, this shall be;
  And out of my flesh shall I see God."

Thus the literal meaning demonstrates a connecting link between verses 25
and 26. The authorised version and the marginal reading seem to lack that
link:

  "And I know that my Redeemer liveth,
  And He shall at length abide upon the earth."

But would you know when this _at length_ is to take place? It will come to
pass when a shaking of the dry bones shall take place, when bone to bone
shall be joined, when sinews and flesh shall come upon them, and skin cover
them above; that is, when the skeleton of my mutilated body shall be raised
a glorified body. In other words,--

  "And after my skin returned, this shall be;
  And out of my flesh shall I see God."

The most ancient translators have evidently put this construction upon the
verse under consideration. The Chaldee paraphrase runs thus:

  [Chaldee: WMN BTR D'TPCH MSHKY TH' D']
  [Chaldee: WMBSRY 'CHMY TWB 'LH'::]

  "And after my skin is healed, this shall be;
  And out of my flesh shall I see the return of God."

[Chaldee: 'TPCH] does not mean here _inflated_, as some suppose. The Syriac
version translates the word [Hebrew: NQPW] by the word [Syriac: 'TKRK],
which means _surround_, _wind round_. The Vulgate has the following version
of the patriarch's prophetic exclamation:

  "Et rursum circumdabor pelle mea,
  Et in carne mea videbo Deum meum."

Jerome evidently knew not what to do with the word [Hebrew: Z'T], and
therefore omitted it. He might have turned it to good account by
translating it _erit hoc_.

The above note has been penned upwards of five years ago, and I transcribe
it now, without a single alteration, for the benefit of MR. C. MANSFIELD
INGLEBY and his friends.

PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.

_Photographic Experiences._--We have received from our valued correspondent
DR. MANSELL, of Guernsey, a suggestion to which we are happy to give
publicity, and to the promotion of which we shall be very glad to lend the
columns of "N. & Q." Our photographic readers are probably aware that the
Talbotype process is increasing in favour; we have recorded DR. DIAMOND'S
strong testimony to its advantages. MR. LLEWELLYN has just described his
process (which is strikingly similar) in the _Photographic Journal_; and in
a recent number of _La Lumiere_ the VICOMTE VIGIER confirms the views of
our countrymen. DR. MANSELL, who has given our readers the benefit of his
experience, well remarks that in all his acquaintance with physical
science, he knows nothing more remarkable than that MR. FOX TALBOT should
not only have discovered this beautiful process, but likewise have given it
to the world (in 1841) in so perfect a form, that the innumerable
experiments of a dozen years have done nothing essential to improve it, and
the best manipulators of the day can add nothing to it. It is, however,
with a view to testing some of the points in which photographers differ, so
as to establish which are best, that DR. MANSELL suggests, that a table
giving,

  1. The time of exposure in the camera, in a bright May sun,
  2. The locality,
  3. The iodizement,
  4. The maker of the paper,
  5. The diameter of the diaphragm,
  6. Its distance from the lens, and
  7. The diameter, focal length, and maker of the lens,

would, if carefully and honestly stated by some twenty or thirty
photographers, be extremely valuable. Of this there can be little doubt,
and we hope that our scientific photographic friends, will respond to this
suggestion. We for our parts are ready to receive any such communications,
and will, at the end of the month, collate and arrange them in such form as
may best exhibit the results. It is obvious that, in a matter of such a
nature, _we_ at least should be furnished with the names of our
correspondents.

_The Ceroleine Process._--The unfavourable state of the weather has
prevented me from making many experiments as to the value of the process
given in your 234th Number, but I have seen enough to convince me that it
will effect a great saving of trouble, and be more sensitive than any
modification of Le Gray's process that has yet been published. It will,
however, be rather more expensive, and, in the hands of persons
unaccustomed to chemical manipulations, rather difficult; but the solutions
once made, the waxing process is delightfully easy.

WILLIAM PUMPHREY.

_On preserving the Sensitiveness of Collodion Plates._--_The Philosophical
Magazine_ of the present month contains a very important article by Messrs.
Spiller and Crookes upon this great desideratum in photographic practice.
We have heard from a gentleman of considerable scientific attainments,
that, from the few experiments which he had then made, he is convinced that
the plan is quite feasible. We of course refer our readers to the paper
itself for fuller particulars as to the reasoning which led the writers to
their successful experiment, and for all enumeration of the many advantages
which may result from their discovery. Their process is as follows:

    "The plate, coated with collodion (that which we employ contains
    iodide, bromide, and chloride of ammonium, in about equal proportions),
    is made sensitive by immersion in the ordinary solution of nitrate of
    {430} silver (30 grains to the ounce), and after remaining there for
    the usual time, is transferred for a second solution of the following
    composition:

      Nitrate of zinc (fused)      2 ounces.
      Nitrate of silver           35 grains.
      Water                        6 ounces.

    The plate must be left in this bath until the zinc solution has
    thoroughly penetrated the film (we have found five minutes amply
    sufficient for this purpose, although a much longer time is of no
    consequence); it should then be taken out, allowed to drain upright on
    blotting-paper until all the surface moisture has been absorbed (about
    half an hour), and then put by until required. The nitrate of zinc,
    which is still retained on the plate, is sufficient to keep it moist
    for any length of time, and we see no theoretical or practical reason
    why its sensitiveness should not be retained as long: experiments on
    this point are in progress; at present, however, we have only subjected
    them to the trial of about a week, although at the end of that period
    they were hardly deteriorated in any appreciable degree. It is not
    necessary that the exposure in the camera should be immediately
    followed by the development, as this latter process can be deferred to
    any convenient opportunity, provided it be within the week. Previous to
    development, the plate should be allowed to remain for a few seconds in
    the original thirty-grain silver-bath, then removed and developed with
    either pyrogallic acid or a protosalt of iron, and afterwards fixed,
    &c. in the usual manner."

_Tippet_ (Vol. ix., p. 370.).--P. C. S. S. cannot help thinking that
_tippet_ is nothing more than a corruption, _per metathesia_, of
_epitogium_. Such, at least, seems to have been the opinion of old Minsheu,
who, in his _Guide to the Tongues_, 1627, describes it thus:

John's Gate, Clerkenwell, immediately above the arch, are three shields:
the centre one bearing a plain cross (the arms of the order); on the right,
as you face the gateway, the shield bears a chevron ingrailed between three
roundles, impaling a cross flory, over all on a chief a cross; that on the
left is merely a single shield, bearing a chevron ingrailed between three
roundles apparently (being somewhat damaged), in chief a plain cross. If
the colours were marked, they are indistinguishable,--shield and charges
are alike sable now. On the south side are two shields: that on the right
has been so much damaged that all I can make out of it is that two coats
have been impaled thereon, but I cannot discover whether it had the cross
in chief or not; that on the left bears a chevron between three roundles,
in chief a plain cross. This shield also is damaged; but, nevertheless,
enough remains to enable one to make out the charges with tolerable
certainty.

that this gentleman, who was Justice of Chester in the last year of the
reign of Mary and the first of Elizabeth, will turn out to be George Wood,
Esq., of Balterley, in the county of Stafford, who married Margaret, relict
of Ralph Birkenhead, of Croughton, in Cheshire, and sixth daughter of Sir
Thomas Grosvenor, of Eaton, Knight, ancestor of the present noble house of
Westminster. If CESTRIENSIS can obtain access to Shaw's _History of
Staffordshire_, the hint I have thrown out may speed him in his
investigations.

_Moon Superstitions_ (Vol. viii., pp. 79. 145. 321.)--The result of my own
observations, as far as they go, is, that remarkable changes of weather
sometimes accompany or follow so closely the changes of the moon, that it
is difficult for the least superstitious persons to refrain from imagining
some connexion between them--and one or two well-marked instances would
make many converts for life to the opinion;--but that in comparatively few
cases are the changes of weather so marked and decided as to give them the
air of cause and effect.

"_Myself_" (Vol. ix., p. 270.).--The inscription from a gravestone,
inserted by G. A. C., brought to my mind a poem by Bernard Barton, which I
had met with in a magazine (_The Youth's Instructor_ for December, 1826),
into which it had been copied from the _Amulet_. The piece is entitled "A
Colloquy with Myself." The first two stanzas, which I had always considered
original, are subjoined for the sake of comparison:

  "As I walk'd by myself, I talk'd to myself,
    And myself replied to me;
  And the questions myself then put to myself,
    With their answers I give to thee.

  Put them home to thyself, and if unto thyself,
    Their responses the same should be:
  O look well to thyself, and beware of thyself,
    Or so much the worse for thee."

Polperro, Cornwall.

I cannot inform G. A. C. by whom or in what year the lines were written,
from which the epitaph he mentions was copied; but he will find them
amongst {431} the Epigrams, &c., &c., in _Elegant Extracts_, in the edition
bearing date 1805, under the title of a Rhapsody.

WEST SUSSEX.

_Roman Roads in England_ (Vol. ix., p. 325.).--I think that in addition to
the reference to _Richard of Cirencester_, PRESTONIENSIS should be apprised
of the late General Roy's _Military Antiquities of Great Britain_
(published by the Society of Antiquaries), a most learned and valuable
account of and commentary on _Richard de Cirencester_, and on all the other
works on the subject; Stukeley, Horsley, &c. I have my own doubts as to the
genuineness of Richard's work; that is, though I admit that the facts are
true, and compiled with accuracy and learning, I cannot quite persuade
myself that the work is that of the Monk of Westminster in the fourteenth
century, never heard of till the discovery of an unique MS. in the Royal
Library at Copenhagen about 1757. I suspect it to have been a much more
modern compilation.

_Anecdote of George IV._ (Vol. ix., pp. 244. 338.)--If JULIA R. BOCKETT has
accurately copied (as we must presume) the note that she has sent you, I am
sorry to inform her that it is a forgery: the Prince never, from his
earliest youth, signed "George" _tout court_; he always added P. If the
story be at all true, your second correspondent, W. H., is assuredly right,
that the "old woman" could not mean the Queen, who was but eighteen when
the Prince was born, and could not, therefore, at any time within which
this note could have been written, be called, even by the giddiest boy, "an
old woman." When the Prince was twelve years old, she was but thirty.

C.

_General Fraser_ (Vol. ix., p. 161.).--The communication of J. C. B.
contains the following sentence:

    "During his interment, the incessant cannonade of the enemy covered
    with dust the chaplain and the officers who assisted in performing the
    last duties to his remains, they being within view of the greatest part
    of both armies."

As some might suppose from this that the American army was guilty of the
infamous action of knowingly firing upon a funeral, the following extract
from Lossing's _Pictorial Field Book of the Revolution_, lately published,
is submitted to the readers of "N. & Q." It tells _the whole truth_ upon
the subject. It is from vol. i. p. 66.:

    "It was just sunset in that calm October evening, that the corpse of
    General Fraser was carried up the hill to the place of burial within
    the 'great redoubt.' It was attended only by the members of his
    military family, and Mr. Brudenel, the chaplain; yet the eyes of
    hundreds of both armies followed the solemn procession, while the
    Americans, ignorant of its true character, kept up a constant cannonade
    upon the redoubt. The chaplain, unmoved by the danger to which he was
    exposed, as the cannon-balls that struck the hill threw the loose soil
    over him, pronounced the impressive funeral service of the Church of
    England with an unfaltering voice.[2] The growing darkness added
    solemnity to the scene. Suddenly the irregular firing ceased, and the
    solemn voice of a single cannon, at measured intervals, boomed along
    the valley and awakened the responses of the hills. It was a minute
    gun, fired by the Americans in honour of the gallant dead. The moment
    information was given that the gathering at the redoubt was a funeral
    company fulfilling, amid imminent perils, the last breathed wishes of
    the noble Fraser, orders were issued to withhold the cannonade with
    balls, and to render military homage to the fallen brave."

I may add, for the information of English readers, that Lossing's
_Pictorial Field Book of the Revolution_ is a work of great general
accuracy, written by a gentleman who travelled thousands of miles to
collect the materials. The drawings for the work were drawn, and the
numerous woodcuts engraved, by him. They are the finest woodcuts ever
produced in this country.

_The Fusion_ (Vol. ix., p. 323.).--The Orleans branch, though it derives
its eventually hereditary claim to the throne of France from Louis XIII.,
as stated by E. H. A., have later connexions in blood with Louis XIV. The
Regent Duke married Mdlle de Blois, the legitimated daughter of Louis XIV.

    in intendment and consideration of the law. They cannot commit treason,

_Female Parish Clerk_ (Vol. viii., p. 338.).--The sexton of my parish, John
Poffley, a man worthy of a place in Wordsworth's _Excursion_, was telling
me but a few days ago, that his mother was the parish clerk for twenty-six
years, and that he well remembers his astonishment as a boy, whenever {432}
he happened to attend a neighbouring church service, to see a man acting in
that capacity, and saying the responses for the people.

I have just seen an extract from "N. & Q." in one of our local papers,
mentioning Elizabeth King as being clerk of the parish of Totteridge in
1802, and a question by Y. S. M. if there were any similar instance on
record of a woman being a parish clerk? In answer to this Query, I beg to
inform Y. S. M. that in the village of Misterton, Somerset, in which place
I was born, a woman acted as clerk at my mother's wedding, my own baptism,
and many years subsequently: I was born in 1822.

WM. HIGGINS.

_Bothy_ (Vol. ix., p. 305.).--For a familiar mention of this word (commonly
spelt _Bothie_), your correspondent may be referred to the poem of _The
Bothie of Toper-na-fuosich_, a Long-Vacation Pastoral, by Arthur Hugh
Clough, Oxford: Macpherson, 1848. The action of the poem is chiefly carried
on at the Bothie, the situation of which is thus described (in hexameter
verse):

  "There on the blank hill side, looking down through the loch to the
      ocean,
  There with a runnel beside, and pine trees twain before it,
  There with the road underneath, and in sight of coaches and steamers,
  Dwelling of David Mackaye, and his daughters Elspie and Bella,
  Sends up a volume of smoke the Bothie of Toper-na-fuosich."

This sort of verse, by the way, is thus humorously spoken of by Professor
Wilson in his dedication, "to the King," of the twelfth volume of Blackwood
(1822):

  "What dost thou think, my liege, of the metre in which I address thee?
  Doth it not sound very big, verse bouncing, bubble-and-squeaky,
  Rattling, and loud, and high, resembling a drum or a bugle--
  Rub-a-dub-dub like the one, like t'other tantaratara?
  (It into use was brought of late by thy Laureate Doctor--
  But, in my humble opinion, I write it better than he does)
  It was chosen by me as the longest measure I knew of,
  And, in praising one's King, it is right full measure to give him."

_King's Prerogative and Hunting Bishops_ (Vol. ix., p. 247.).--The passage
of Blackstone, referred to by the Edinburgh Reviewer, will be found in his
_Commentaries_, vol. ii, p. 413., where reference is made to 4 [Cokes']
_Inst._ 309. See also the same volume of Blackstone, p. 427. It is evident
that Bishop Jewel possessed his "muta canum." See a curious account of a
visit to him by Hermann Falkerzhuemer, in the _Zurich Letters_, second
series, pp. 84 &c.

_Green Eyes_ (Vol. viii., p. 407.; Vol. ix., p. 112.).--Antoine Heroet, an
early French poet, in the third book of his _Opuscules d'Amour_, has the
following lines:

  "Amour n'est pas enchanteur si divers
  Que les yeux noirs face devenir _verds_,
  Qu'un brun obscur en blancheur clere tourne,
  Ou qu'un traict gros du vissage destourne."

(Love is not so strange an enchanter that he can make black eyes become
green, that he can turn a dark brown into clear whiteness, or that he can
change a coarse feature of the face.)

_Brydone the Tourist_ (Vol. ix., pp. 138. 255. 305.).--

    "On lui a reproche d'avoir sacrifie la verite au plaisir de raconter
    des choses piquantes."

In a work (I think) entitled _A Tour in Sicily_, the production of Captain
Monson, uncle to the late Lord Monson, published about thirty years ago, I
remember to have read a denial and, as far as I can remember, a refutation
of a statement of Brydone, that he had seen a pyramid in the gardens or
grounds of some dignitary in Sicily, composed of--chamber-pots! I was, when
I read Mr. Monson's book (a work of some pretensions as it appeared to me),
a youngster newly returned from foreign travel, and in daily intercourse
with gentlemen of riper age than myself, and of attainments as travellers
and otherwise which I could not pretend to; many of them were Italians, and
I perfectly remember that by all, but especially by the latter, Brydone's
book was treated as a book of apocrypha.

TRAVELLER.

_Descendants of John of Gaunt, Noses of_ (Vol. vii., p. 96.).--Allow me to
repeat my Query as to E. D.'s remark: he says, to be dark-complexioned and
black-haired "is the family badge of the Herberts quite as much as the
unmistakeable nose in the descendants of John of Gaunt." I hope E. D. will
not continue silent, for I am very curious to know his meaning.

Y. S. M.

_"Put"_ (Vol. vii., p. 271.).--I am surprised at the silence of your Irish
readers in reference to the pronunciation of this word. I certainly never
yet heard it pronounced like "but" amongst educated men in Ireland, and I
am both a native of this country and resident here the greater part of my
life. The Prince Consort's name I have {433} occasionally heard, both in
England and Ireland, pronounced as if the first letter was an
O--"Olbert"--and that by people who ought to know better.

Y. S. M.

_"Caricature; a Canterbury Tale"_ (Vol. ix., p. 351.).--The inquiry of H.
as to the meaning of a "Caricature," which he describes (though I doubt if
he be correct as to all the personages), appears to me to point to a
transaction in the history of the celebrated "Coalition Ministry" of Lord
North and Fox; in which--

    "Burke being Paymaster of the Forces, committed one or two imprudent
    acts: among them, the restoration of Powel and Bembridge, two
    defaulting subordinates in his office, to their situations. His friends
    of the ministry were hardly tasked to bring him through these scrapes;
    and, to use the language of Wraxall's _Memoirs_, 'Fox warned the
    Paymaster of the Forces, as he valued his office, not to involve his
    friends in any similar dilemma during the remainder of the Session.'"

NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.

Dr. Waagen, the accomplished Director of the Royal Gallery of Pictures,
Berlin, has just presented us with three volumes, to which, as Englishmen,
we may refer with pride, because they bear testimony not only to the
liberality of our expenditure in works of art, but also to the good taste
and judgment which have generally regulated our purchases. _The Treasures
of Art in Great Britain, being an Account of the Chief Collections of
Paintings, Drawings, Sculptures, Illuminated MSS., &c._, as the work is
designated, must become a handbook to every lover of Art in this country.
It is an amplification of Dr. Waagen's first work, _Art and Artists in
England_, giving, not only the results of the author's more ripened
judgment and extended experience, but also an account of twenty-eight
collections in and round London, of nineteen in England generally, and of
seven in Scotland, not contained in his former work. And as the Doctor has
bestowed much pains in obtaining precise information regarding the art of
painting in England since the time of Hogarth, and of sculpture since the
time of Flaxman; and also devoted much time to the study of English
miniatures contained in MSS. from the earliest time down to the sixteenth
century; of miniatures of other nations preserved in England; of drawings
by the old masters, engravings and woodcuts; he is fully justified in
saying that, both as regards the larger class of the public who are
interested in knowing the actual extent of the treasures of Art in England,
and also the more learned connoisseurs of the history of Art, this edition
offers incomparably richer and more maturely digested materials than the
former one. Let us add, that the value of this important and most useful
and instructive book is greatly enhanced by a very careful Index.

We have received from Messrs. Johnston, the geographers and engravers to
the Queen, two maps especially useful at the present moment, viz., one of
the Baltic Sea, with enlarged plans of Cronstadt, Revel, Sveaborg, Kiel
Bay, and Winga Sound; and the other of the seat of war in the Danubian
Principalities and Turkey, with map of Central Europe.

At the Annual General Meeting of the Camden Society on Tuesday last, M. Van

The Inaugural General Meeting of the Surrey Archaeological Society is
announced for Wednesday next, at the Bridge House Hotel, London Bridge,

8th, to Mr. Bridger, the curator.

Daring, &c._, by Edward Giffard, _Second Series_. This new volume of
Murray's _Railway Reading_ is well timed.--_The Diary and Letters of Madame
D'Arblay_, Vol. III., carries on her record of the gossip of the Court

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
