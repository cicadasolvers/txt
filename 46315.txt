PREFACE.


The Records of Auburn have a close and important relation to those of
Worcester, Leicester, Sutton and Oxford, towns prominent in the
history of the early settlement of central Massachusetts. Especially
are these Records supplementary to the Town Records of Worcester,
which have been edited and printed in full by the Trustee of the
Systematic History Fund, and they may be considered in reality a
continuation of the work which was comprehended in a plan formed by
him for the practical development of the original historical material
of this section.

With the exception of brief sketches in narrative form, comprised
in certain general works, nothing in the shape of a town history
of Auburn has been printed. Its Records are in a fair state of
preservation, but accessible only to those who are on the ground.
This first publication presents the full personal record (which in
every case is the true foundation of local history) so far as it
can be gathered from the town books, and added to this are the
inscriptions from the two older burial grounds in the town, all in
systematized form for reference.

Speaking in a general way, all local records of the early period in
New England are incomplete and imperfect, the degree varying to some
extent in different places, but none have been found entirely free
from omissions, discrepancies and other errors. The Records of Auburn
afford about the average number of such instances. But this statement
should not carry the implication that the value and practical
usefulness of town and other records are seriously impaired by the
small percentage of inaccuracies common in all human works, and of
which a large proportion can be rectified by effort and patience. The
substantial ground-work of the original entries in the Auburn town
books is here supplied, and the addition of the burial ground
inscriptions will aid in completing the record of deaths.

In the work of collecting and copying this material I have had
the benefit of the services of Mr. George Maynard as a competent
assistant. To Mr. Charles E. Prouty, the Town Clerk of Auburn, and to
Mrs. Prouty, my acknowledgments are due for their courtesy, and for
free access to the Records at all times.

HISTORICAL NOTE.


The Town of Auburn was originally set off from Worcester, Sutton,
Leicester and Oxford, and was incorporated on the 10th of April,
1778, with the name of Ward, in honor of General Artemas Ward, of
Shrewsbury, a man of great prominence in this region, active as a
patriot during the difficulties that caused the separation from
the mother country, and receiving on the eve of hostilities the
appointment of First Major General in the Revolutionary Army. He
was at a later period Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas,
and afterwards served in Congress. He died in 1800 at the age of
seventy-three.

A precinct was organized at this place July 27th, 1773, called the
South Parish of Worcester, and three years later the church was
formed. In 1777 Rev. Isaac Bailey became the first pastor.

More or less opposition was manifested against the formation of the
new township in the several places from which its territory was taken,
and committees were chosen to contest the proposed action in the
General Court. It is probable that the intention to separate from
the older towns had been cherished for several years by those who,
though nominally apart in corporate interests, were in their isolated
situation united for common convenience and protection of material
rights. This purpose after it was divulged could not long be
resisted, but the event was postponed for several years by a quasi
acknowledgment of independence. Twice in 1776 and 1777, as the Town
Records of Worcester testify, were special war taxes abated to the
inhabitants of the South Parish, perhaps with the hope of holding them
to their allegiance; but in the fall of the last named year the matter
was brought directly to a settlement, as appears by the following
extract from the Worcester Records:

    "The Town of Worcester Having been served with a Coppy of the
    Petition of William Phips & Charles Richardson praying 'the
    present members of the Precinct lately Erected out of Worcester,
    Leicester, Oxford & Sutton may be incorporated into a Town,
    according to a plan Exhibited with said petition &c. and the
    Hon{ble} General assemblys Resolve thereon, of the 24{th} day of
    Oct{r}. last, Requireing the said Towns to shew Cause, if any
    they have, on the third Wednesday of the next Session of the S{d}
    Court why the prayer of S{d} petition should not be granted.'

    The Town of Worcester, in answer to S{d} Petition and Order of
    Court, beg leave to say, that they have not been served with a
    plan of said town exhibited with said Petition to the Court, and
    therefore are not in a Capacity to offer reasons against, or to
    comply with it untill they know how far it Extends. But if the
    said plan Does not include any of those persons nor their Estates
    which belong to the Town of Worcester, and which were Excepted
    from being set off to said precinct when it was first Erected, We
    have no objections to their being made a Distinct Town. But if
    said plann includes those persons and their Estates who were first
    Exempted from belonging to said precinct, and are still unwilling
    to be set off to said Town, We beg leave to say we think it would
    be inconsistent to include a Number of persons & their Estates
    into the said New Town and still continue them to belong to the
    Town of Worcester, and to include them in the plann aforesaid &
    set them off against their Consent & the Consent of this Town, is
    departing from the principles upon which the said precinct was
    at first Erected, and will subject the said persons to an
    inconvenience that they had a right to Expect an Exemption from by
    the act of the General assembly & as the said persons who were
    first Exempted from belonging to S{d} Precinct and who are still
    unwilling to be set off to S{d} new Town and their Estates all
    lay upon the side of S{d} new Town next to Worcester, this Town
    are humbly of opinion that a line may be run between the Town of
    Worcester & the Sd new Town Leaving the S{d} persons & their
    Estates to the Town of Worcester without any Inconveniency to
    Either of the said Towns, which if complied with the Town of
    Worcester are Content.

On the 2d of February, 1778, in Worcester Town Meeting, it was voted
to choose two persons to meet the Committee of the General Court, to
view the proposed new township, and to fix the lines and boundaries;
and on the 23d of the same month, it was voted to remonstrate against
the proceedings of said Committee, and the lines established between
the towns, with what effect it does not appear.

                     *      *      *      *      *

On the 10th of the following April the Precinct was incorporated as a
Town and named Ward.

February 17th, 1837, the name of the Town was changed to Auburn. This
was influenced largely, it is said, by the confusion in writing the
names Ward and Ware by those not familiar with the two places.

The Order establishing the South Precinct or Parish of Worcester
comprises the names of those who were the first residents of the new
town, and the founders of the prominent families, the names of whose
immediate progeny and later descendants appear in the Records embodied
in this volume:

    In Council, June 19, 1773, ordered that Gershom Rice, Israel
    Stevens, David Bancroft, Jonathan Stone, Daniel Boyden, Jacob
    Stevens, Thomas Drury, Thomas Drury, Jr., Henry Gale, Wm.

    live not further than one mile and a half from said place, who
    shall signify their desire to belong to said Precinct by lodging

    date, be and hereby are Incorporated and made a part of the
    Precinct aforesaid--Ordered that the spot for erecting the
    meeting-house upon be at the following place (viz)., at an Oak
    stump with stones upon it, Standing on the Westerly side of the

    two acres of Land which Thomas Drury conveyed to Jonathan Stone,
    Daniel Boyden and David Bancroft; the said two acres of land lieth
    on the gore of land which was annexed to the town of Worcester.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
