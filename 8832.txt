Book 44 Acts

001:001 My former narrative, Theophilus, dealt with all that Jesus
        did and taught as a beginning, down to the day on which,

001:002 after giving instruction through the Holy Spirit to the Apostles
        whom He had chosen, He was taken up to Heaven.

001:003 He had also, after He suffered, shown Himself alive to them
        with many sure proofs, appearing to them at intervals during
        forty days, and speaking of the Kingdom of God.

001:004 And while in their company He charged them not to leave
        Jerusalem, but to wait for the Father's promised gift.
        "This you have heard of," He said, "from me.

001:005 For John indeed baptized with water, but before many days
        have passed you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit."

001:006 Once when they were with Him, they asked Him, "Master, is this
        the time at which you are about to restore the kingdom of Israel?"

001:007 "It is not for you," He replied, "to know times or epochs
        which the Father has reserved within His own authority;

001:008 and yet you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come
        upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all
        Judaea and Samaria and to the remotest parts of the earth."

001:009 When He had said this, and while they were looking
        at Him, He was carried up, and a cloud closing beneath Him
        hid Him from their sight.

001:010 But, while they stood intently gazing into the sky as He went,
        suddenly there were two men in white garments standing by them,

001:011 who said, "Galilaeans, why stand looking into the sky?
        This same Jesus who has been taken up from you into Heaven
        will come in just the same way as you have seen Him
        going into Heaven."

001:012 Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mountain called
        the Oliveyard, which is near Jerusalem, about a mile off.

001:013 They entered the city, and they went up to the upper room which
        was now their fixed place for meeting.  Their names were Peter
        and John, James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew
        and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot,
        and Judas the brother of James.

001:014 All of these with one mind continued earnest in prayer,
        together with some women, and Mary the mother of Jesus,
        and His brothers.

001:015 It was on one of these days that Peter stood up in the midst
        of the brethren--the entire number of persons present being
        about 120--and said,

001:016 "Brethren, it was necessary that the Scripture should be fulfilled--
        the prediction, I mean, which the Holy Spirit uttered by
        the lips of David, about Judas, who acted as guide to those
        who arrested Jesus.

001:017 For Judas was reckoned as one of our number, and a share
        in this ministry was allotted to him."

001:018 (Now having bought a piece of ground with the money paid for his
        wickedness he fell there with his face downwards, and, his body
        bursting open, he became disembowelled.

001:019 This fact became widely known to the people of Jerusalem,
        so that the place received the name, in their language,
        of Achel-damach, which means `The Field of Blood.')

001:020 "For it is written in the Book of Psalms, "`Let his encampment
        be desolate:  let there be no one to dwell there'; and "`His
        work let another take up.'

001:021 "It is necessary, therefore, that of the men who have been with us
        all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us--

001:022 beginning from His baptism by John down to the day on which He
        was taken up again from us into Heaven--one should be appointed
        to become a witness with us as to His resurrection."

001:023 So two names were proposed, Joseph called Bar-sabbas--
        and surnamed Justus--and Matthias.

001:024 And the brethren prayed, saying, "Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts
        of all, show clearly which of these two Thou hast chosen

001:025 to occupy the place in this ministry and Apostleship from
        which Judas through transgression fell, in order to go
        to his own place."

001:026 Then they drew lots between them.  The lot fell on Matthias,
        and a place among the eleven Apostles was voted to him.

002:001 At length, on the day of the Harvest Festival, they had all met
        in one place;

002:002 when suddenly there came from the sky a sound as of a strong
        rushing blast of wind.  This filled the whole house where
        they were sitting;

002:003 and they saw tongues of what looked like fire distributing
        themselves over the assembly, and on the head of each person
        a tongue alighted.

002:004 They were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak
        in foreign languages according as the Spirit gave them
        words to utter.

002:005 Now there were Jews residing in Jerusalem, devout men from every
        part of the world.

002:006 So when this noise was heard, they came crowding together,
        and were amazed because everyone heard his own language spoken.

002:007 They were beside themselves with wonder, and exclaimed,
        "Are not all these speakers Galilaeans?

002:008 How then does each of us hear his own native language
        spoken by them?

002:009 Some of us are Parthians, Medes, Elamites.  Some are inhabitants
        of Mesopotamia, of Judaea or Cappadocia, of Pontus or the
        Asian Province, of Phrygia or Pamphylia,

002:010 of Egypt or of the parts of Africa towards Cyrene.
        Others are visitors from Rome--being either Jews or converts
        from heathenism--and others are Cretans or Arabians.

002:011 Yet we all alike hear these Galilaeans speaking in our own
        language about the wonderful things which God has done."

002:012 They were all astounded and bewildered, and asked one another,
        "What can this mean?"

002:013 But others, scornfully jeering, said, "They are brim-full
        of sweet wine."

002:014 Peter however, together with the Eleven, stood up and addressed
        them in a loud voice.  "Men of Judaea, and all you inhabitants
        of Jerusalem," he said, "be in no uncertainty about this
        matter but pay attention to what I say.

002:015 For this is not intoxication, as you suppose, it being only
        the third hour of the day.

002:016 But that which was predicted through the Prophet Joel has happened:

002:017 "And it shall come to pass in the last days, God says,
        that I will pour out My Spirit upon all mankind; and your sons
        and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall
        see visions, and your old men shall have dreams;

002:018 and even upon My bondservants, both men and women, at that time,
        I will pour out My Spirit, and they shall prophesy.

002:019 I will display marvels in the sky above, and signs on the earth below,
        blood and fire, and pillars of smoke.

002:020 The sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood,
        to usher in the day of the Lord--that great and illustrious day;

002:021 and every one who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.'

002:022 "Listen, Israelites, to what I say.  Jesus, the Nazarene,
        a man accredited to you from God by miracles and marvels
        and signs which God did among you through Him, as you
        yourselves know, Him--

002:023 delivered up through God's settled purpose and foreknowledge--
        you by the hands of Gentiles have nailed to a cross and have
        put to death.

002:024 But God has raised Him to life, having terminated the throes
        of death, for in fact it was not possible for Him to be held
        fast by death.

002:025 For David says in reference to Him, "`I constantly fixed my
        eyes upon the Lord, because He is at my right hand in order
        that I may continue unshaken.

002:026 For this reason my heart is glad and my tongue exults.
        My body also shall rest in hope.

002:027 For Thou wilt not leave me in the Unseen World forsaken,
        nor give up Thy holy One to undergo decay.

002:028 Thou hast made known to me the ways of Life:  Thou wilt fill
        me with gladness in Thy presence.'

002:029 "As to the patriarch David, I need hardly remind you, brethren,
        that he died and was buried, and that we still have his
        tomb among us.

002:030 Being a Prophet, however, and knowing that God had solemnly
        sworn to him to seat a descendant of his upon his throne,

002:031 with prophetic foresight he spoke of the resurrection of the Christ,
        to the effect that He was not left forsaken in the Unseen World,
        nor did His body undergo decay.

002:032 This Jesus, God has raised to life--a fact to which all
        of us testify.

002:033 "Being therefore lifted high by the mighty hand of God, He has
        received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit and has
        poured out this which you see and hear.

002:034 For David did not ascend into Heaven, but he says himself,
        "`The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand

002:035 until I make thy foes a footstool under thy feet.'

002:036 "Therefore let the whole House of Israel know beyond
        all doubt that God has made Him both LORD and CHRIST--
        this Jesus whom you crucified."

002:037 Stung to the heart by these words, they said to Peter and the rest
        of the Apostles, "Brethren, what are we to do?"

002:038 "Repent," replied Peter, "and be baptized, every one of you,
        in the name of Jesus Christ, with a view to the remission
        of your sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.

002:039 For to you belongs the promise, and to your children,
        and to all who are far off, whoever the Lord our God may call."

002:040 And with many more appeals he solemnly warned and entreated them,
        saying, "Escape from this crooked generation."

002:041 Those, therefore, who joyfully welcomed his Message were baptized;
        and on that one day about three thousand persons were
        added to them;

002:042 and they were constant in listening to the teaching of the
        Apostles and in their attendance at the Communion, that is,
        the Breaking of the Bread, and at prayer.

002:043 Fear came upon every one, and many marvels and signs were done
        by the Apostles.

002:044 And all the believers kept together, and had everything in common.

002:045 They sold their lands and other property, and distributed
        the proceeds among all, according to every one's necessities.

002:046 And, day by day, attending constantly in the Temple with one accord,
        and breaking bread in private houses, they took their meals
        with great happiness and single-heartedness,

002:047 praising God and being regarded with favour by all the people.
        Also, day by day, the Lord added to their number those whom
        He was saving.

003:001 One day Peter and John were going up to the Temple for the hour
        of prayer--the ninth hour--and, just then,

003:002 some men were carrying there one who had been lame from birth,
        whom they were wont to place every day close to the Beautiful Gate
        (as it was called) of the Temple, for him to beg from the people
        as they went in.

003:003 Seeing Peter and John about to go into the Temple, he asked
        them for alms.

003:004 Peter fixing his eyes on him, as John did also, said, "Look at us."

003:005 So he looked and waited, expecting to receive something from them.

003:006 "I have no silver or gold," Peter said, "but what I have, I give you.
        In the name of Jesus Christ, the Nazarene--walk!"

003:007 Then taking his hand Peter lifted him up, and immediately
        his feet and ankles were strengthened.

003:008 Leaping up, he stood upright and began to walk, and went into
        the Temple with them, walking, leaping, and praising God.

003:009 All the people saw him walking and praising God;

003:010 and recognizing him as the man who used to sit at the Beautiful Gate
        of the Temple asking for alms, they were filled with awe
        and amazement at what had happened to him.

003:011 While he still clung to Peter and John, the people, awe-struck, ran up
        crowding round them in what was known as Solomon's Portico.

003:012 Peter, seeing this, spoke to the people.  "Israelites," he said,
        "why do you wonder at this man?  Or why gaze at us, as though
        by any power or piety of our own we had enabled him to walk?

003:013 The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our forefathers,
        has conferred this honour on His Servant Jesus, whom you
        delivered up and disowned in the presence of Pilate,
        when he had decided to let Him go.

003:014 Yes, you disowned the holy and righteous One, and asked
        as a favour the release of a murderer.

003:015 The Prince of Life you put to death; but God has raised Him
        from the dead, and we are witnesses as to that.

003:016 It is His name--faith in that name being the condition--
        which has strengthened this man whom you behold and know;
        and the faith which He has given has made this man sound
        and strong again, as you can all see.

003:017 "And now, brethren, I know that it was in ignorance that you
        did it, as was the case with your rulers also.

003:018 But in this way God has fulfilled the declarations He made
        through all the Prophets, that His Christ would suffer.

003:019 Repent, therefore, and reform your lives, so that the record
        of your sins may be cancelled, and that there may come seasons
        of revival from the Lord,

003:020 and that He may send the Christ appointed beforehand
        for you--even Jesus.

003:021 Heaven must receive Him until those times of which God has spoken
        from the earliest ages through the lips of His holy Prophets--
        the times of the reconstitution of all things.

003:022 Moses declared, "`The Lord your God will raise up a Prophet
        for you from among your brethren as He has raised me.
        In all that He says to you, you must listen to Him.

003:023 And every one, without exception, who refuses to listen to that
        Prophet shall be utterly destroyed from among the People.'

003:024 Yes, and all the Prophets, from Samuel onwards--all who have spoken--
        have also announced the coming of this present time.

003:025 "You are the heirs of the Prophets, and of the Covenant which God
        made with your forefathers when He said to Abraham, `And through
        your posterity all the families of the world shall be blessed.'

003:026 It is to you first that God, after raising His Servant from
        the grave, has sent Him to bless you, by causing every one
        of you to turn from your wickedness."

004:001 While they were saying this to the people, the Priests,
        the Commander of the Temple Guard, and the Sadducees
        came upon them,

004:002 highly incensed at their teaching the people and proclaiming
        in the case of Jesus the Resurrection from among the dead.

004:003 They arrested the two Apostles and lodged them in custody till
        the next day; for it was already evening.

004:004 But many of those who had listened to their preaching believed;
        and the number of the adult men had now grown to be about 5,000.

004:005 The next day a meeting was held in Jerusalem of their
        Rulers, Elders, and Scribes,

004:006 with Annas the High Priest, Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and the
        other members of the high-priestly family.

004:007 So they made the Apostles stand in the centre, and demanded
        of them, "By what power or in what name have you done this?"

004:008 Then Peter was filled with the Holy Spirit, and he replied,
        "Rulers and Elders of the people,

004:009 if we to-day are under examination concerning the benefit
        conferred on a man helplessly lame, as to how this man
        has been cured;

004:010 be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel,
        that through the name of Jesus the Anointed, the Nazarene,
        whom *you* crucified, but whom *God* has raised from among
        the dead--through that name this man stands here before you
        in perfect health.

004:011 This Jesus is the Stone treated with contempt by you the builders,
        but it has been made the Cornerstone.

004:012 And in no other is the great salvation to be found; for, in fact,
        there is no second name under Heaven that has been given
        among men through which we are to be saved."

004:013 As they looked on Peter and John so fearlessly outspoken--
        and also discovered that they were illiterate persons,
        untrained in the schools--they were surprised; and now they
        recognized them as having been with Jesus.

004:014 And seeing the man standing with them--the man who had been cured--
        they had no reply to make.

004:015 So they ordered them to withdraw from the Sanhedrin while they
        conferred among themselves.

004:016 "What are we to do with these men?" they asked one another;
        for the fact that a remarkable miracle has been performed
        by them is well known to every one in Jerusalem, and we
        cannot deny it.

004:017 But to prevent the matter spreading any further among the people,
        let us stop them by threats from speaking in the future
        in this name to any one whatever."

004:018 So they recalled the Apostles, and ordered them altogether
        to give up speaking or teaching in the name of Jesus.

004:019 But Peter and John replied, "Judge whether it is right in God's
        sight to listen to you instead of listening to God.

004:020 As for us, what we have seen and heard we cannot
        help speaking about."

004:021 The Court added further threats and then let them go,
        being quite unable to find any way of punishing them on account
        of the people, because all gave God the glory for the thing
        that had happened.

004:022 For the man was over forty years of age on whom this miracle
        of restoration to health had been performed.

004:023 After their release the two Apostles went to their friends,
        and told them all that the High Priests and Elders had said.

004:024 And they, upon hearing the story, all lifted up their voices
        to God and said, "O Sovereign Lord, it is Thou who didst make
        Heaven and earth and sea, and all that is in them,

004:025 and didst say through the Holy Spirit by the lips of our forefather
        David Thy servant, "`Why have the nations stamped and raged,
        and the peoples formed futile plans?

004:026 The kings of the earth came near, and the rulers assembled
        together against the Lord and against His Anointed.'"

004:027 "They did indeed assemble in this city in hostility to Thy holy
        Servant Jesus whom Thou hadst anointed--Herod and Pontius Pilate
        with the Gentiles and also the tribes of Israel--

004:028 to do all that Thy power and Thy will had predetermined
        should be done.

004:029 And now, Lord, listen to their threats, and enable Thy servants
        to proclaim Thy Message with fearless courage,

004:030 whilst Thou stretchest out Thine arm to cure men, and to give
        signs and marvels through the name of Thy holy Servant Jesus."

004:031 When they had prayed, the place in which they were assembled shook,
        and they were, one and all, filled with the Holy Spirit,
        and proceeded to tell God's Message with boldness.

004:032 Among all those who had embraced the faith there was but one heart
        and soul, so that none of them claimed any of his possessions
        as his own, but everything they had was common property;

004:033 while the Apostles with great force of conviction delivered
        their testimony as to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus;
        and great grace was upon them all.

004:034 And, in fact, there was not a needy man among them,
        for all who were possessors of lands or houses sold them,
        and brought the money which they realised,

004:035 and gave it to the Apostles, and distribution was made to every
        one according to his wants.

004:036 In this way Joseph, whom the Apostles gave the name of Bar-nabas--
        signifying `Son of Encouragement'--a Levite, a native of Cyprus,

004:037 sold a farm which he had, and brought the money and gave it
        to the Apostles.

005:001 There was a man of the name of Ananias who, with his wife Sapphira,
        sold some property but,

005:002 with her full knowledge and consent, dishonestly kept back
        part of the price which he received for it, though he brought
        the rest and gave it to the Apostles.

005:003 "Ananias," said Peter, "why has Satan taken possession of your heart,
        that you should try to deceive the Holy Spirit and dishonestly
        keep back part of the price paid you for this land?

005:004 While it remained unsold, was not the land your own?
        And when sold, was it not at your own disposal?
        How is it that you have cherished this design in your heart?
        It is not to men you have told this lie, but to God."

005:005 Upon hearing these words Ananias fell down dead, and all who
        heard the words were awe-struck.

005:006 The younger men, however, rose, and wrapping the body up,
        carried it out and buried it.

005:007 About three hours had passed, when his wife came in,
        knowing nothing of what had happened.

005:008 Peter at once questioned her.  "Tell me," he said,
        "whether you sold the land for so much."  "Yes," she replied,
        "for so much."

005:009 "How was it," replied Peter, "that you two agreed to try
        an experiment upon the Spirit of the Lord?  The men who have
        buried your husband are already at the door, and they will
        carry you out."

005:010 Instantly she fell down dead at his feet, and the young men came
        in and found her dead.  So they carried her out and buried
        her by her husband's side.

005:011 This incident struck terror into the whole Church, and into
        the hearts of all who heard of it.

005:012 Many signs and marvels continued to be done among the people
        by the Apostles; and by common consent they all met
        in Solomon's Portico.

005:013 But none of the others dared to attach themselves to them.
        Yet the people held them in high honour--

005:014 and more and more believers in the Lord joined them,
        including great numbers both of men and women--

005:015 so that they would even bring out their sick friends into
        the streets and lay them on light couches or mats, in order
        that when Peter came by, at least his shadow might fall
        on one or other of them.

005:016 The inhabitants, too, of the towns in the neighbourhood
        of Jerusalem came in crowds, bringing sick persons and some
        who were harassed by foul spirits, and they were cured,
        one and all.

005:017 This roused the High Priest.  He and all his party--the sect
        of the Sadducees--were filled with angry jealousy

005:018 and laid hands upon the Apostles, and put them into the public jail.

005:019 But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the prison
        doors and brought them out, and said,

005:020 "Go and stand in the Temple, and go on proclaiming to the people
        all this Message of Life."

005:021 Having received that command they went into the Temple,
        just before daybreak, and began to teach:  So when the High Priest
        and his party came, and had called together the Sanhedrin
        as well as all the Elders of the descendants of Israel,
        they sent to the jail to fetch the Apostles.

005:022 But the officers went and could not find them in the prison.
        So they came back and brought word,

005:023 saying, "The jail we found quite safely locked, and the warders
        were on guard at the doors, but upon going in we found
        no one there."

005:024 When the Commander of the Temple Guards and the High Priests heard
        this statement, they were utterly at a loss with regard to it,
        wondering what would happen next.

005:025 And some one came and brought them word, saying, "The men you
        put in prison are actually in the Temple, standing there,
        teaching the people."

005:026 Upon this the Commander went with the officers, and brought
        the Apostles; but without using violence; for they were afraid
        of being stoned by the people.

005:027 So they brought them and made them stand in front of the Sanhedrin.
        And then the High Priest questioned them.

005:028 "We strictly forbad you to teach in that name--did we not?" he said.
        "And see, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching,
        and are trying to make us responsible for that man's death!"

005:029 Peter and the other Apostles replied, "We must obey God
        rather than man.

005:030 The God of our forefathers has raised Jesus to life, whom you
        crucified and put to death.

005:031 God has exalted Him to His right hand as Chief Leader and as Saviour,
        to give Israel repentance and forgiveness of sins.

005:032 And we--and the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey Him--
        are witnesses as to these things."

005:033 Infuriated at getting this answer, they were disposed to
        kill the Apostles.

005:034 But a Pharisee of the name of Gamaliel, a teacher of the Law,
        held in honour by all the people, rose from his seat and requested
        that they should be sent outside the court for a few minutes.

005:035 "Israelites," he said, "be careful what you are about to do
        in dealing with these men.

005:036 Years ago Theudas appeared, professing to be a person of importance,
        and a body of men, some four hundred in number, joined him.
        He was killed, and all his followers were dispersed and annihilated.

005:037 After him, at the time of the Census, came Judas, the Galilaean,
        and was the leader in a revolt.  He too perished, and all
        his followers were scattered.

005:038 And now I tell you to hold aloof from these men and leave
        them alone--for if this scheme or work is of human origin,
        it will come to nothing.

005:039 But if it is really from God, you will be powerless to put
        them down--lest perhaps you find yourselves to be actually
        fighting against God."

005:040 His advice carried conviction.  So they called the Apostles in, and--
        after flogging them--ordered them not to speak in the name
        of Jesus, and then let them go.

005:041 They, therefore, left the Sanhedrin and went their way,
        rejoicing that they had been deemed worthy to suffer disgrace
        on behalf of the NAME.

005:042 But they did not desist from teaching every day,
        in the Temple or in private houses, and telling the Good News
        about Jesus, the Christ.

006:001 About this time, as the number of disciples was increasing,
        complaints were made by the Greek-speaking Jews against
        the Hebrews because their widows were habitually overlooked
        in the daily ministration.

006:002 So the Twelve called together the general body of the disciples
        and said, "It does not seem fitting that we Apostles should
        neglect the delivery of God's Message and minister at tables.

006:003 Therefore, brethren, pick out from among yourselves seven
        men of good repute, full of the Spirit and of wisdom,
        and we will appoint them to undertake this duty.

006:004 But, as for us, we will devote ourselves to prayer and to
        the delivery of the Message."

006:005 The suggestion met with general approval, and they
        selected Stephen, a man full of faith and of the
        Holy Spirit, Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas,
        and Nicolas, a proselyte of Antioch.

006:006 These men they brought to the Apostles, and, after prayer,
        they laid their hands upon them.

006:007 Meanwhile God's Message continued to spread, and the number
        of the disciples in Jerusalem very greatly increased,
        and very many priests obeyed the faith.

006:008 And Stephen, full of grace and power, performed great marvels
        and signs among the people.

006:009 But some members of the so-called `Synagogue of the Freed-men,'
        together with some Cyrenaeans, Alexandrians, Cilicians and men
        from Roman Asia, were roused to encounter Stephen in debate.

006:010 They were quite unable, however, to resist the wisdom and
        the Spirit with which he spoke.

006:011 Then they privately put forward men who declared, "We have heard
        him speak blasphemous things against Moses and against God."

006:012 In this way they excited the people, the Elders, and the Scribes.
        At length they came upon him, seized him with violence,
        and took him before the Sanhedrin.

006:013 Here they brought forward false witnesses who declared,
        "This fellow is incessantly speaking against the Holy Place
        and the Law.

006:014 For we have heard him say that Jesus, the Nazarene, will pull
        this place down to the ground and will change the customs
        which Moses handed down to us."

006:015 At once the eyes of all who were sitting in the Sanhedrin
        were fastened on him, and they saw his face looking just
        like the face of an angel.

007:001 Then the High Priest asked him, "Are these statements true?"

007:002 The reply of Stephen was, "Sirs--brethren and fathers--listen to me.
        God Most Glorious appeared to our forefather Abraham when
        he was living in Mesopotamia, before he settled in Haran,

007:003 and said to him, "`Leave your country and your relatives,
        and go into whatever land I point out to you.'

007:004 "Thereupon he left Chaldaea and settled in Haran till after
        the death of his father, when God caused him to remove into
        this country where you now live.

007:005 But he gave him no inheritance in it, no, not a single square
        yard of ground.  And yet He promised to bestow the land
        as a permanent possession on him and his posterity after him--
        and promised this at a time when Abraham was childless.

007:006 And God declared that Abraham's posterity should for four
        hundred years make their home in a country not their own,
        and be reduced to slavery and be oppressed.

007:007 "`And the nation, whichever it is, that enslaves them,
        I will judge,' said God; `and afterwards they shall come out,
        and they shall worship Me in this place.'

007:008 "Then He gave him the Covenant of circumcision, and under this
        Covenant he became the father of Isaac--whom he circumcised
        on the eighth day.  Isaac became the father of Jacob,
        and Jacob became the father of the twelve Patriarchs.

007:009 "The Patriarchs were jealous of Joseph and sold him into slavery
        in Egypt.  But God was with him

007:010 and delivered him from all his afflictions, and gave him favour
        and wisdom when he stood before Pharaoh, king of Egypt,
        who appointed him governor over Egypt and all the royal household.

007:011 But there came a famine throughout the whole of Egypt and Canaan--
        and great distress--so that our forefathers could find no food.

007:012 When, however, Jacob heard that there was wheat to be had,
        he sent our forefathers into Egypt; that was the first time.

007:013 On their second visit Joseph made himself known to his brothers,
        and Pharaoh was informed of Joseph's parentage.

007:014 Then Joseph sent and invited his father Jacob and all his family,
        numbering seventy-five persons, to come to him,

007:015 and Jacob went down into Egypt.  There he died, and so
        did our forefathers,

007:016 and they were taken to Shechem and were laid in the tomb
        which Abraham had bought from the sons of Hamor at Shechem
        for a sum of money paid in silver.

007:017 "But as the time drew near for the fulfilment of the promise
        which God had made to Abraham, the people became many times
        more numerous in Egypt,

007:018 until there arose a foreign king over Egypt who knew
        nothing of Joseph.

007:019 He adopted a crafty policy towards our race, and oppressed
        our forefathers, making them cast out their infants so that they
        might not be permitted to live.

007:020 At this time Moses was born--a wonderfully beautiful child;
        and for three months he was cared for in his father's house.

007:021 At length he was cast out, but Pharaoh's daughter adopted him,
        and brought him up as her own son.

007:022 So Moses was educated in all the learning of the Egyptians,
        and possessed great influence through his eloquence
        and his achievements.

007:023 "And when he was just forty years old, it occurred to him
        to visit his brethren the descendants of Israel.

007:024 Seeing one of them wrongfully treated he took his part,
        and secured justice for the ill-treated man by striking
        down the Egyptian.

007:025 He supposed his brethren to be aware that by him God was sending
        them deliverance; this, however, they did not understand.

007:026 The next day, also, he came and found two of them fighting,
        and he endeavoured to make peace between them.  "`Sirs,' he said,
        `you are brothers.  Why are you wronging one another?'

007:027 "But the man who was doing the wrong resented his interference,
        and asked, "`Who appointed you magistrate and judge over us?

007:028 Do you mean to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?'

007:029 "Alarmed at this question, Moses fled from the country and went
        to live in the land of Midian.  There he became the father
        of two sons.

007:030 "But at the end of forty years there appeared to him in the Desert
        of Mount Sinai an angel in the middle of a flame of fire
        in a bush.

007:031 When Moses saw this he wondered at the sight; but on his going
        up to look further, the voice of the Lord was heard, saying,

007:032 "`I am the God of your forefathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac,
        and of Jacob.'  "Quaking with fear Moses did not dare gaze.

007:033 "`Take off your shoes,' said the Lord, `for the spot on which you
        are standing is holy ground.

007:034 I have seen, yes, I have seen the oppression of My people
        who are in Egypt and have heard their groans, and I have come
        down to deliver them.  And now I will send you to Egypt.'

007:035 "The Moses whom they rejected, asking him, `Who appointed you
        magistrate and judge?'--that same Moses we find God sending
        as a magistrate and a deliverer by the help of the angel
        who appeared to him in the bush.

007:036 This was he who brought them out, after performing marvels
        and signs in Egypt and at the Red Sea, and in the Desert
        for forty years.

007:037 This is the Moses who said to the descendants of Israel, "`God
        will raise up a Prophet for you, from among your brethren,
        just as He raised me up.'

007:038 `This is he who was among the Congregation in the Desert,
        together with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai
        and with our forefathers, who received ever-living utterances
        to hand on to us.

007:039 "Our forefathers, however, would not submit to him, but spurned
        his authority and in their hearts turned back to Egypt.

007:040 They said to Aaron, "`Make gods for us, to march in front of us;
        for as for this Moses who brought us out of the land of Egypt,
        we do not know what has become of him.'

007:041 "Moreover they made a calf at that time, and offered a sacrifice
        to the idol and kept rejoicing in the gods which their own
        hands had made.

007:042 So God turned from them and gave them up to the worship
        of the Host of Heaven, as it is written in the Book of
        the Prophets, "'Were they victims and sacrifices which you
        offered Me, forty years in the Desert, O House of Israel?

007:043 Yes, you lifted up Moloch's tent and the Star of the God Rephan--
        the images which you made in order to worship them;
        and I will remove you beyond Babylon.'

007:044 "Our forefathers had the Tent of the Testimony in the Desert,
        built as He who spoke to Moses had instructed him to make it
        in imitation of the model which he had seen.

007:045 That Tent was bequeathed to the next generation of our forefathers.
        Under Joshua they brought it with them when they were taking
        possession of the land of the Gentile nations, whom God drove
        out before them.  So it continued till David's time.

007:046 David obtained favour with God, and asked leave to provide
        a dwelling-place for the God of Jacob.

007:047 But it was Solomon who built a house for Him.

007:048 Yet the Most High does not dwell in buildings erected by men's hands.
        But, as the Prophet declares,

007:049 "`The sky is My throne, and earth is the footstool for My feet.
        What kind of house will you build for Me, says the Lord,
        or what resting place shall I have?

007:050 Did not My hand form this universe.'

007:051 "O stiff-necked men, uncircumcised in heart and ears,
        you also are continually at strife with the Holy Spirit--
        just as your forefathers were.

007:052 Which of the Prophets did not your forefathers persecute?
        Yes, they killed those who announced beforehand the advent
        of the righteous One, whose betrayers and murderers you
        have now become--

007:053 you who received the Law given through angels, and yet have
        not obeyed it."

007:054 As they listened to these words, they became infuriated
        and gnashed their teeth at him.

007:055 But, full of the Holy Spirit and looking up to Heaven, Stephen saw
        the glory of God, and Jesus standing at God's right hand.

007:056 "I can see Heaven wide open," he said, "and the Son of Man
        standing at God's right hand."

007:057 Upon this, with a loud outcry they stopped their ears,
        rushed upon Stephen in a body,

007:058 dragged him out of the city, and stoned him, the witnesses
        throwing off their outer garments and giving them into the care
        of a young man called Saul.

007:059 So they stoned Stephen, while he prayed, "Lord Jesus,
        receive my spirit."

007:060 Then, rising on his knees, he cried aloud, "Lord, do not reckon
        this sin against them."  And with these words he fell asleep.

008:001 And Saul fully approved of his murder.  At this time a great
        persecution broke out against the Church in Jerusalem,
        and all except the Apostles were scattered throughout
        Judaea and Samaria.

008:002 A party of devout men, however, buried Stephen, and made loud
        lamentation over him.

008:003 But Saul cruelly harassed the Church.  He went into house
        after house, and, dragging off both men and women,
        threw them into prison.

008:004 Those, however, who were scattered abroad went from place
        to place spreading the Good News of God's Message;

008:005 while Philip went down to the city of Samaria and proclaimed
        Christ there.

008:006 Crowds of people, with one accord, gave attention to what
        they heard from him, listening, and witnessing the signs
        which he did.

008:007 For, with a loud cry, foul spirits came out of many possessed by them,
        and many paralytics and lame persons were restored to health.

008:008 And there was great joy in that city.

008:009 Now for some time past there had been a man named Simon living there,
        who had been practising magic and astonishing the Samaritans,
        pretending that he was more than human.

008:010 To him people of all classes paid attention, declaring, "This man
        is the Power of God, known as the great Power."

008:011 His influence over them arose from their having been,
        for a long time, bewildered by his sorceries.

008:012 But when Philip began to tell the Good News about the Kingdom
        of God and about the Name of Jesus Christ, and they embraced
        the faith, they were baptized, men and women alike.

008:013 Simon himself also believed, and after being baptized remained
        in close attendance on Philip, and was full of amazement
        at seeing such signs and such great miracles performed.

008:014 When the Apostles in Jerusalem heard that the Samaritans had
        accepted God's Message, they sent Peter and John to visit them.

008:015 They, when they came down, prayed for them that they might
        receive the Holy Spirit:

008:016 for He had not as yet fallen upon any of them.  They had only
        been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.

008:017 Then the Apostles placed their hands upon them, and they
        received the Holy Spirit.

008:018 When, however, Simon saw that it was through the laying
        on of the Apostles' hands that the Spirit was bestowed,
        he offered them money.

008:019 "Give me too," he said, "that power, so that every one on whom
        I place my hands will receive the Holy Spirit."

008:020 "Perish your money and yourself," replied Peter, "because you
        have imagined that you can obtain God's free gift with money!

008:021 No part or lot have you in this matter, for your heart is not
        right in God's sight.

008:022 Repent, therefore, of this wickedness of yours, and pray
        to the Lord, in the hope that the purpose which is in your
        heart may perhaps be forgiven you.

008:023 For I perceive that you have fallen into the bitterest
        bondage of unrighteousness."

008:024 "Pray, both of you, to the Lord for me," answered Simon,
        "that nothing of what you have said may come upon me."

008:025 So the Apostles, after giving a solemn charge and delivering
        the Lord's Message, travelled back to Jerusalem, making known
        the Good News also in many of the Samaritan villages.

008:026 And an angel of the Lord said to Philip, "Rise and proceed
        south to the road that runs down from Jerusalem to Gaza,
        crossing the Desert."

008:027 Upon this he rose and went.  Now, as it happened, an Ethiopian
        eunuch who was in a position of high authority with Candace,
        queen of the Ethiopians, as her treasurer, had visited
        Jerusalem to worship there,

008:028 and was now on his way home; and as he sat in his chariot
        he was reading the Prophet Isaiah.

008:029 Then the Spirit said to Philip, "Go and enter that chariot."

008:030 So Philip ran up and heard the eunuch reading the Prophet Isaiah.
        "Do you understand what you are reading?" he asked.

008:031 "Why, how can I," replied the eunuch, "unless some one explains
        it to me?"  And he earnestly invited Philip to come up
        and sit with him.

008:032 The passage of Scripture which he was reading was this:
        "Like a sheep He was led to slaughter, and just as a lamb
        before its shearer is dumb so He opened not His mouth.

008:033 In His humiliation justice was denied Him.  Who will make
        known His posterity?  For He is destroyed from among men."

008:034 "Pray, of whom is the Prophet speaking?" inquired the eunuch;
        "of himself or of some one else?"

008:035 Then Philip began to speak, and, commencing with that same
        portion of Scripture, told him the Good News about Jesus.

008:036 So they proceeded on their way till they came to some water;
        and the eunuch exclaimed, "See, here is water; what is there
        to prevent my being baptized?"

008:037 []

008:038 So he stopped the chariot; and both of them--Philip and the eunuch--
        went down into the water, and Philip baptized him.

008:039 But no sooner had they come up out of the water than the Spirit of
        the Lord caught Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him again.
        With a glad heart he resumed his journey;

008:040 but Philip found himself at Ashdod.  Then visiting town
        after town he everywhere made known the Good News until
        he reached Caesarea.

009:001 Now Saul, whose every breath was a threat of destruction
        for the disciples of the Lord,

009:002 went to the High Priest and begged from him letters addressed
        to the synagogues in Damascus, in order that if he found
        any believers there, either men or women, he might bring them
        in chains to Jerusalem.

009:003 But on the journey, as he was getting near Damascus,
        suddenly there flashed round him a light from Heaven;

009:004 and falling to the ground he heard a voice which said to him,
        "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?"

009:005 "Who art thou, Lord?" he asked.  "I am Jesus, whom you
        are persecuting," was the reply.

009:006 "But rise and go to the city, and you will be told what you
        are to do.

009:007 Meanwhile the men who travelled with Saul were standing dumb
        with amazement, hearing a sound, but seeing no one.

009:008 Then he rose from the ground, but when he had opened his eyes,
        he could not see, and they led him by the arm and brought
        him to Damascus.

009:009 And for two days he remained without sight, and did not eat
        or drink anything.

009:010 Now in Damascus there was a disciple of the name of Ananias.
        The Lord spoke to him in a vision, saying, "Ananias!"  "I am
        here, Lord," he answered.

009:011 "Rise," said the Lord, "and go to Straight Street, and inquire
        at the house of Judas for a man called Saul, from Tarsus,
        for he is actually praying.

009:012 He has seen a man called Ananias come and lay his hands upon
        him so that he may recover his sight."

009:013 "Lord," answered Ananias, "I have heard about that man from many,
        and I have heard of the great mischief he has done to Thy
        people in Jerusalem;

009:014 and here he is authorized by the High Priests to arrest all
        who call upon Thy name."

009:015 "Go," replied the Lord; "he is a chosen instrument of Mine
        to carry My name to the Gentiles and to kings and to the
        descendants of Israel.

009:016 For I will let him know the great sufferings which he must
        pass through for My sake."

009:017 So Ananias went and entered the house; and, laying his two
        hands upon Saul, said, "Saul, brother, the Lord--even Jesus
        who appeared to you on your journey--has sent me, that you
        may recover your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit."

009:018 Instantly there dropped from his eyes what seemed to be scales,
        and he could see once more.  Upon this he rose and received baptism;

009:019 after which he took food and regained his strength.
        Then he remained some little time with the disciples in Damascus.

009:020 And in the synagogues he began at once to proclaim Jesus
        as the Son of God;

009:021 and his hearers were all amazed, and began to ask one another,
        "Is not this the man who in Jerusalem tried to exterminate
        those who called upon that Name, and came here on purpose
        to carry them off in chains to the High Priests?"

009:022 Saul, however, gained more and more influence, and as for
        the Jews living in Damascus, he bewildered them with his proofs
        that Jesus is the Christ.

009:023 At length the Jews plotted to kill Saul;

009:024 but information of their intention was given to him.
        They even watched the gates, day and night, in order
        to murder him;

009:025 but his disciples took him by night and let him down through
        the wall, lowering him in a hamper.

009:026 So he came to Jerusalem and made several attempts to associate
        with the disciples, but they were all afraid of him,
        being in doubt as to whether he himself was a disciple.

009:027 Barnabas, however, came to his assistance.  He brought Saul
        to the Apostles, and related to them how, on his journey,
        he had seen the Lord, and that the Lord had spoken to him,
        and how in Damascus he had fearlessly taught in the name of Jesus.

009:028 Henceforth Saul was one of them, going in and out of the city,

009:029 and speaking fearlessly in the name of the Lord.  And he often
        talked with the Hellenists and had discussions with them.

009:030 But they kept trying to take his life.  On learning this,
        the brethren brought him down to Caesarea, and then sent him
        by sea to Tarsus.

009:031 The Church, however, throughout the whole of Judaea, Galilee
        and Samaria, had peace and was spiritually built up;
        and grew in numbers, living in the fear of the Lord and receiving
        encouragement from the Holy Spirit.

009:032 Now Peter, as he went to town after town, came down also to God's
        people at Lud.

009:033 There he found a man of the name of Aeneas, who for eight
        years had kept his bed, through being paralysed.

009:034 Peter said to him, "Aeneas, Jesus Christ cures you.
        Rise and make your own bed."  He at once rose to his feet.

009:035 And all the people of Lud and Sharon saw him; and they turned
        to the Lord.

009:036 Among the disciples at Jaffa was a woman called Tabitha,
        or, as the name may be translated, `Dorcas.' Her life was
        wholly devoted to the good and charitable actions which she
        was constantly doing.

009:037 But, as it happened, just at that time she was taken ill and died.
        After washing her body they laid it out in a room upstairs.

009:038 Lud, however, being near Jaffa, the disciples, who had heard
        that Peter was at Lud, sent two men to him with an urgent
        request that he would come across to them without delay.

009:039 So Peter rose and went with them.  On his arrival they took
        him upstairs, and the widow women all came and stood by his side,
        weeping and showing him the underclothing and cloaks and
        garments of all kinds which Dorcas used to make while she
        was still with them.

009:040 Peter, however, putting every one out of the room,
        knelt down and prayed, and then turning to the body,
        he said, "Tabitha, rise."  Dorcas at once opened her eyes,
        and seeing Peter, sat up.

009:041 Then, giving her his hand, he raised her to her feet and,
        calling to him God's people and the widows, he / 7 gave her
        back to them alive.

009:042 This incident became known throughout Jaffa, and many believed
        in the Lord;

009:043 and Peter remained for a considerable time at Jaffa,
        staying at the house of a man called Simon, a tanner.

010:001 Now a Captain of the Italian Regiment, named Cornelius,
        was quartered at Caesarea.

010:002 He was religious and God-fearing--and so was every member
        of his household.  He was also liberal in his charities
        to the people, and continually offered prayer to God.

010:003 About three o'clock one afternoon he had a vision,
        and distinctly saw an angel of God enter his house, who called
        him by name, saying, "Cornelius!"

010:004 Looking steadily at him, and being much alarmed, he said,
        "What do you want, Sir?"  "Your prayers and charities,"
        he replied, "have gone up and have been recorded before God.

010:005 And now send to Jaffa and fetch Simon, surnamed Peter.

010:006 He is staying as a guest with Simon, a tanner, who has a house
        close to the sea."

010:007 So when the angel who had been speaking to him was gone,
        Cornelius called two of his servants and a God-fearing soldier
        who was in constant attendance on him,

010:008 and, after telling them everything, he sent them to Jaffa.

010:009 The next day, while they were still on their journey
        and were getting near the town, about noon Peter went up
        on the house-top to pray.

010:010 He had become unusually hungry and wished for food; but, while they
        were preparing it, he fell into a trance.

010:011 The sky had opened to his view, and what seemed to be an enormous
        sail was descending, being let down to the earth by ropes
        at the four corners.

010:012 In it were all kinds of quadrupeds, reptiles and birds,

010:013 and a voice came to him which said, "Rise, Peter, kill and eat."

010:014 "On no account, Lord," he replied; "for I have never yet eaten
        anything unholy and impure."

010:015 Again a second time a voice was heard which said, "What God
        has purified, you must not regard as unholy."

010:016 This was said three times, and immediately the sail was drawn
        up out of sight.

010:017 While Peter was greatly perplexed as to the meaning of the vision
        which he had seen, just then the men sent by Cornelius,
        having by inquiry found out Simon's house,

010:018 had come to the door and had called the servant, and were asking,
        "Is Simon, surnamed Peter, staying here?"

010:019 And Peter was still earnestly thinking over the vision,
        when the Spirit said to him, "Three men are now inquiring for you.

010:020 Rise, go down, and go with them without any misgivings;
        for it is I who have sent them to you."

010:021 So Peter went down and said to the men, "I am the Simon you
        are inquiring for.  What is the reason of your coming?"

010:022 Their reply was, "Cornelius, a Captain, an upright and
        God-fearing man, of whom the whole Jewish nation speaks well,
        has been divinely instructed by a holy angel to send for you
        to come to his house and listen to what you have to say."

010:023 Upon hearing this, Peter invited them in, and gave them a lodging.
        The next day he set out with them, some of the brethren
        from Jaffa going with him,

010:024 and the day after that they reached Caesarea.  There Cornelius
        was awaiting their arrival, and had invited all his relatives
        and intimate friends to be present.

010:025 When Peter entered the house, Cornelius met him, and threw
        himself at his feet to do him homage.

010:026 But Peter lifted him up.  "Stand up," he said; "I myself
        also am but a man."

010:027 So Peter went in and conversed with him, and found a
        large company assembled.

010:028 He said to them, "You know better than most that a Jew is
        strictly forbidden to associate with a Gentile or visit him;
        but God has taught me to call no one unholy or unclean.

010:029 So for this reason, when sent for, I came without raising
        any objection.  I therefore ask why you sent for me."

010:030 "Just at this hour, three days ago," replied Cornelius, "I was
        offering afternoon prayer in my house, when suddenly a man
        in shining raiment stood in front of me,

010:031 who said, "`Cornelius, your prayer has been heard, and your
        charities have been put on record before God.

010:032 Send therefore to Jaffa, and invite Simon, surnamed Peter,
        to come here.  He is staying as a guest in the house of Simon,
        a tanner, close to the sea.'

010:033 "Immediately, therefore, I sent to you, and I thank you heartily
        for having come.  That is why all of us are now assembled here
        in God's presence, to listen to what the Lord has commanded
        you to say."

010:034 Then Peter began to speak.  "I clearly see," he said,
        "that God makes no distinctions between one man and another;

010:035 but that in every nation those who fear Him and live good lives
        are acceptable to Him.

010:036 The Message which He sent to the descendants of Israel, when He
        announced the Good News of peace through Jesus Christ--He is
        Lord of all--that Message you cannot but know;

010:037 the story, I mean, which has spread through the length and
        breadth of Judaea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism
        which John proclaimed.

010:038 It tells how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit
        and with power, so that He went about everywhere doing acts
        of kindness, and curing all who were being continually
        oppressed by the Devil--for God was with Jesus.

010:039 "And we are witnesses as to all that He did both in the country
        of the Jews and in Jerusalem.  But they even put Him
        to death, by crucifixion.

010:040 That same Jesus God raised to life on the third day,
        and permitted Him to appear unmistakably,

010:041 not to all the people, but to witnesses--men previously chosen
        by God--namely, to us, who ate and drank with Him after He
        rose from the dead.

010:042 And He has commanded us to preach to the people and solemnly
        declare that this is He who has been appointed by God to be
        the Judge of the living and the dead.

010:043 To Him all the Prophets bear witness, and testify that through
        His name all who believe in Him receive the forgiveness
        of their sins."

010:044 While Peter was speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell
        on all who were listening to the Message.

010:045 And all the Jewish believers who had come with Peter were
        astonished that on the Gentiles also the gift of the Holy Spirit
        was poured out.

010:046 For they heard them speaking in tongues and extolling the majesty
        of God.  Then Peter said,

010:047 "Can any one forbid the use of water, and object to these persons
        being baptized--men who have received the Holy Spirit just
        as we did?"

010:048 And he directed that they should be baptized in the name
        of Jesus Christ.  Then they begged him to remain with them
        for a time.

011:001 Now the Apostles, and the brethren in various parts of Judaea,
        heard that the Gentiles also had received God's Message;

011:002 and, when Peter returned to Jerusalem, the champions of
        circumcision found fault with him.

011:003 "You went into the houses of men who are not Jews," they said,
        "and you ate with them."

011:004 Peter, however, explained the whole matter to them
        from the beginning.

011:005 "While I was in the town of Jaffa, offering prayer," he said,
        "in a trance I saw a vision.  There descended what seemed
        to be an enormous sail, being let down from the sky by ropes
        at the four corners, and it came close to me.

011:006 Fixing my eyes on it, I examined it closely, and saw various
        kinds of quadrupeds, wild beasts, reptiles and birds.

011:007 I also heard a voice saying to me, "`Rise, Peter, kill and eat.'

011:008 "`On no account, Lord,' I replied, `for nothing unholy or impure
        has ever gone into my mouth.'

011:009 "But a voice answered, speaking a second time from the sky,
        "`What God has purified, you must not regard as unholy.'

011:010 "This was said three times, and then everything was drawn up
        again out of sight.

011:011 "Now at that very moment three men came to the house where we were,
        having been sent from Caesarea to find me.

011:012 And the Spirit told me to accompany them without any misgivings.
        There also went with me these six brethren who are now present,
        and we reached the Centurion's house.

011:013 Then he described to us how he had seen the angel come and enter
        his house and say, "`Send to Jaffa and fetch Simon, surnamed Peter.

011:014 He will teach you truths by which you and all your family
        will be saved.'"

011:015 "And," said Peter, "no sooner had I begun to speak than
        the Holy Spirit fell upon them, just as He fell upon us
        at the first.

011:016 Then I remembered the Lord's words, how He used to say,
        "`John baptized with water, but you shall be baptized
        in the Holy Spirit.'

011:017 "If therefore God gave them the same gift as He gave us when we
        first believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, why, who was I
        to be able to thwart God?"

011:018 This statement of Peter's silenced his opponents.  They extolled
        the goodness of God, and said, "So, then, to the Gentiles
        also God has given the repentance which leads to Life."

011:019 Those, however, who had been driven in various directions
        by the persecution which broke out on account of Stephen made
        their way to Phoenicia, Cyprus and Antioch, delivering the Message
        to none but Jews.

011:020 But some of them were Cyprians and Cyrenaeans, who, on coming
        to Antioch, spoke to the Greeks also and told them the Good News
        concerning the Lord Jesus.

011:021 The power of the Lord was with them, and there were a vast
        number who believed and turned to the Lord.

011:022 When tidings of this reached the ears of the Church in Jerusalem,
        they sent Barnabas as far as Antioch.

011:023 On getting there he was delighted to see the grace which
        God had bestowed; and he encouraged them all to remain,
        with fixed resolve, faithful to the Lord.

011:024 For he was a good man, and was full of the Holy Spirit and of faith;
        and the number of believers in the Lord greatly increased.

011:025 Then Barnabas paid a visit to Tarsus to try to find Saul.

011:026 He succeeded, and brought him to Antioch; and for a whole year
        they attended the meetings of the Church, and taught a large
        number of people.  And it was in Antioch that the disciples
        first received the name of `Christians.'

011:027 At that time certain Prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch,

011:028 one of whom, named Agabus, being instructed by the Spirit,
        publicly predicted the speedy coming of a great famine
        throughout the world.  (It came in the reign of Claudius.)

011:029 So the disciples decided to send relief, every one in proportion
        to his means, to the brethren living in Judaea.

011:030 This they did, forwarding their contributions to the Elders
        by Barnabas and Saul.

012:001 Now, about that time, King Herod arrested certain members
        of the Church, in order to ill-treat them;

012:002 and James, John's brother, he beheaded.

012:003 Finding that this gratified the Jews, he proceeded to seize
        Peter also; these being the days of Unleavened Bread.

012:004 He had him arrested and lodged in jail, handing him over to
        the care of sixteen soldiers; and intended after the Passover
        to bring him out again to the people.

012:005 So Peter was kept in prison; but long and fervent prayer was
        offered to God by the Church on his behalf.

012:006 Now when Herod was on the point of taking him out of prison,
        that very night Peter was asleep between two soldiers,
        bound with two chains, and guards were on duty outside the door.

012:007 Suddenly an angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light shone
        in the cell; and, striking Peter on the side, he woke him
        and said, "Rise quickly."  Instantly the chains dropped
        off his wrists.

012:008 "Fasten your girdle," said the angel, "and tie on your sandals."
        He did so.  Then the angel said, "Throw your cloak round you,
        and follow me."

012:009 So Peter went out, following him, yet could not believe
        that what the angel was doing was real, but supposed that
        he saw a vision.

012:010 And passing through the first ward and the second, they came
        to the iron gate leading into the city.  This opened to them
        of itself; and, going out, they passed on through one of
        the streets, and then suddenly the angel left him.

012:011 Peter coming to himself said, "Now I know for certain that the Lord
        has sent His angel and has rescued me from the power of Herod
        and from all that the Jewish people were anticipating."

012:012 So, after thinking things over, he went to the house of Mary,
        the mother of John surnamed Mark, where a large number
        of people were assembled, praying.

012:013 When he knocked at the wicket in the door, a maidservant named
        Rhoda came to answer the knock;

012:014 and recognizing Peter's voice, for very joy she did not open
        the door, but ran in and told them that Peter was standing there.

012:015 "You are mad," they said.  But she strenuously maintained
        that it was true.  "It is his guardian angel," they said.

012:016 Meanwhile Peter went on knocking, until at last they opened the door
        and saw that it was really he, and were filled with amazement.

012:017 But he motioned with his hand for silence, and then described
        to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison.
        "Tell all this to James and the brethren," he added.
        Then he left them, and went to another place.

012:018 When morning came, there was no little commotion among the soldiers,
        as to what could possibly have become of Peter.

012:019 And when Herod had had him searched for and could not find him,
        after sharply questioning the guards he ordered them away
        to execution.  He then went down from Judaea to Caesarea
        and remained there.

012:020 Now the people of Tyre and Sidon had incurred Herod's
        violent displeasure.  So they sent a large deputation to wait on him;
        and having secured the good will of Blastus, his treasurer,
        they begged the king to be friendly with them again,
        because their country was dependent on his for its food supply.

012:021 So, on an appointed day, Herod, having arrayed himself in royal robes,
        took his seat on the tribunal, and was haranguing them;

012:022 and the assembled people kept shouting, "It is the voice of a god,
        and not of a man!"

012:023 Instantly an angel of the Lord struck him, because he had not
        given the glory to God, and being eaten up by worms, he died.

012:024 But God's Message prospered, and converts were multiplied.

012:025 And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, having discharged
        their mission, and they brought with them John, surnamed Mark.

013:001 Now there were in Antioch, in the Church there--as Prophets
        and teachers--barnabas, Symeon surnamed `the black,'
        Lucius the Cyrenaean, Manaen (who was Herod the Tetrarch's
        foster-brother), and Saul.

013:002 While they were worshipping the Lord and fasting,
        the Holy Spirit said, "Set apart for Me, now at once,
        Barnabas and Saul, for the work to which I have called them."

013:003 So, after fasting and prayer and the laying on of hands,
        they let them go.

013:004 They therefore, being thus sent out by the Holy Spirit,
        went down to Seleuceia, and from there sailed to Cyprus.

013:005 Having reached Salamis, they began to announce God's Message
        in the synagogues of the Jews.  And they had John
        as their assistant.

013:006 When they had gone through the whole length of the island
        as far as Paphos, they there met with a Jewish magician
        and false prophet, Bar-Jesus by name,

013:007 who was a friend of the Proconsul Sergius Paulus.
        The Proconsul was a man of keen intelligence.  He sent
        for Barnabas and Saul, and asked to be told God's Message.

013:008 But Elymas (or `the Magician,' for such is the meaning of the name)
        opposed them, and tried to prevent the Proconsul from
        accepting the faith.

013:009 Then Saul, who is also called Paul, was filled with the
        Holy Spirit, and, fixing his eyes on Elymas,

013:010 said, "You who are full of every kind of craftiness and
        unscrupulous cunning--you son of the Devil and foe to all that
        is right--will you never cease to misrepresent the straight
        paths of the Lord?

013:011 The Lord's hand is now upon you, and you will be blind for a time
        and unable to see the light of day."  Instantly there fell
        upon him a mist and a darkness, and, as he walked about,
        he begged people to lead him by the hand.

013:012 Then the Proconsul, seeing what had happened, believed, being struck
        with amazement at the teaching of the Lord.

013:013 From Paphos, Paul and his party put out to sea and sailed
        to Perga in Pamphylia.  John, however, left them and
        returned to Jerusalem.

013:014 But they themselves, passing through from Perga, came to
        Antioch in Pisidia.  Here, on the Sabbath day, they went
        into the synagogue and sat down.

013:015 After the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the Wardens
        of the synagogue sent word to them.  "Brethren," they said,
        "if you have anything encouraging to say to the people, speak."

013:016 So Paul rose, and motioning with his hand for silence, said,
        "Israelites, and you others who fear God, pay attention to me.

013:017 The God of this people of Israel chose our forefathers,
        and made the people great during their stay in Egypt,
        until with wondrous power He brought them out from that land.

013:018 For a period of about forty years, He fed them, like a nurse,
        in the Desert.

013:019 Then, after overthrowing seven nations in the land of Canaan, He
        divided that country among them as their inheritance for about
        four hundred and fifty years;

013:020 and afterwards He gave them judges down to the time of
        the Prophet Samuel.

013:021 Next they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul the son
        of Kish, a Benjamite, who reigned forty years.

013:022 After removing him, He raised up David to be their king,
        to whom He also bore witness when He said, "`I have found David
        the son of Jesse, a man I love, who will obey all My commands.'

013:023 "It is from among David's descendants that God, in fulfilment
        of His promise, has raised up a Saviour for Israel, even Jesus.

013:024 Before the coming of Jesus, John had proclaimed to all the people
        of Israel a baptism of repentance.

013:025 But John, towards the end of his career, repeatedly asked
        the people, "`What do you suppose me to be?  I am not the Christ.
        But there is One coming after me whose sandal I am not
        worthy to unfasten.'

013:026 "Brethren, descendants of the family of Abraham, and all among
        you who fear God, to us has this Message of salvation been sent.

013:027 For the people of Jerusalem and their rulers, by the judgement
        they pronounced on Jesus, have actually fulfilled the predictions
        of the Prophets which are read Sabbath after Sabbath,
        through ignorance of those predictions and of Him.

013:028 Without having found Him guilty of any capital offence they
        urged Pilate to have Him put to death;

013:029 and when they had carried out everything which had been written
        about Him, they took Him down from the cross and laid Him
        in a tomb.

013:030 "But God raised Him from the dead.

013:031 And, after a few days, He appeared to the people who had gone
        up with Him from Galilee to Jerusalem and are now witnesses
        concerning Him to the Jews.

013:032 And we bring you the Good News about the promise made
        to our forefathers,

013:033 that God has amply fulfilled it to our children in raising up Jesus;
        as it is also written in the second Psalm, `Thou art My Son:
        to-day I have become Thy Father.'

013:034 And as to His having raised Him from among the dead, never again
        to be in the position of one soon to return to decay,
        He speaks thus:  `I will give you the holy and trustworthy
        promises made to David.'

013:035 Because in another Psalm also He says, `Thou wilt not give up
        Thy Holy One to undergo decay.'

013:036 For David, after having been useful to his own generation
        in accordance with God's purpose, did fall asleep, was gathered
        to his forefathers, and did undergo decay.

013:037 But He whom God raised to life underwent no decay.

013:038 "Understand therefore, brethren, that through this Jesus
        forgiveness of sins is announced to you;

013:039 and in Him every believer is absolved from all offences,
        from which you could not be absolved under the Law of Moses.

013:040 Beware, then, lest what is spoken in the Prophets should come
        true of you:

013:041 `Behold, you despisers, be astonished and perish, because I am
        carrying on a work in your time--a work which you will utterly
        refuse to believe, though it be fully declared to you.'"

013:042 As Paul and Barnabas were leaving the synagogue, the people
        earnestly begged to have all this repeated to them on
        the following Sabbath.

013:043 And, when the congregation had broken up, many of the Jews
        and of the devout converts from heathenism continued with Paul
        and Barnabas, who talked to them and urged them to hold fast
        to the grace of God.

013:044 On the next Sabbath almost the whole population of the city
        came together to hear the Lord's Message.

013:045 Seeing the crowds, the Jews, filled with angry jealousy,
        opposed Paul's statements and abused him.

013:046 Then, throwing off all reserve, Paul and Barnabas said,
        "We were bound to proclaim God's Message to you first.
        But since you spurn it and judge yourselves to be unworthy
        of the Life of the Ages--well, we turn to the Gentiles.

013:047 For such is the Lord's command to us.  "`I have placed Thee,' He says
        of Christ, `as a light to the Gentiles, in order that Thou mayest
        be a Saviour as far as the remotest parts of the earth.'"

013:048 The Gentiles listened with delight and extolled the Lord's Message;
        and all who were pre-destined to the Life of the Ages believed.

013:049 So the Lord's Message spread through the whole district.

013:050 But the Jews influenced the gentlewomen of rank who worshipped
        with them, and also the leading men in the city, and stirred
        up persecution against Paul and Barnabas and drove them out
        of the district.

013:051 But they shook off the dust from their feet as a protest
        against them and came to Iconium;

013:052 and as for the disciples, they were more and more filled
        with joy and with the Holy Spirit.

014:001 At Iconium the Apostles went together to the Jewish synagogue
        and preached, with the result that a great number both of Jews
        and Greeks believed.

014:002 But the Jews who had refused obedience stirred up the Gentiles
        and embittered their minds against the brethren.

014:003 Yet Paul and Barnabas remained there for a considerable time,
        speaking freely and relying on the Lord, while He bore witness
        to the Message of His grace by permitting signs and marvels
        to be done by them.

014:004 At length the people of the city split into parties, some siding
        with the Jews and some with the Apostles.

014:005 And when a hostile movement was made by both Gentiles and Jews,
        with the sanction of their magistrates, to maltreat and stone them,

014:006 the Apostles, having become aware of it, made their
        escape into the Lycaonian towns of Lystra and Derbe,
        and the neighbouring country.

014:007 And there they continued to tell the Good News.

014:008 Now a man who had no power in his feet used to sit in the streets
        of Lystra.  He had been lame from his birth and had never walked.

014:009 After this man had listened to one of Paul's sermons, the Apostle,
        looking steadily at him and perceiving that he had faith
        to be cured,

014:010 said in a loud voice, "Stand upright upon your feet!"

014:011 So he sprang up and began to walk about.  Then the crowds,
        seeing what Paul had done, rent the air with their shouts
        in the Lycaonian language, saying, "The gods have assumed
        human form and have come down to us."

014:012 They called Barnabas `Zeus,' and Paul, as being the
        principal speaker, `Hermes.'

014:013 And the priest of Zeus--the temple of Zeus being at the entrance
        to the city--brought bullocks and garlands to the gates,
        and in company with the crowd was intending to offer
        sacrifices to them.

014:014 But the Apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of it; and tearing
        their clothes they rushed out into the middle of the crowd,
        exclaiming, "Sirs, why are you doing all this?

014:015 We also are but men, with natures kindred to your own;
        and we bring you the Good News that you are to turn from these
        unreal things, to worship the ever-living God, the Creator
        of earth and sky and sea and of everything that is in them.

014:016 In times gone by He allowed all the nations to go their own ways;

014:017 and yet by His beneficence He has not left His existence unattested--
        His beneficence, I mean, in sending you rain from Heaven and
        fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and joyfulness."

014:018 Even with words like these they had difficulty in preventing
        the thronging crowd from offering sacrifices to them.

014:019 But now a party of Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, and,
        having won over the crowd, they stoned Paul and dragged him
        out of the town, believing him to be dead.

014:020 When, however, the disciples had collected round him,
        he rose and went back into the town.  The next day he went
        with Barnabas to Derbe;

014:021 and, after proclaiming the Good News to the people there
        and gaining a large number of converts, they retraced their
        steps to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch.

014:022 Everywhere they strengthened the disciples by encouraging
        them to hold fast to the faith, and warned them saying,
        "It is through many afflictions that we must make our way
        into the Kingdom of God."

014:023 And in every Church, after prayer and fasting, they selected
        Elders by show of hands, and commended them to the Lord
        on whom their faith rested.

014:024 Then passing through Pisidia they came into Pamphylia;

014:025 and after telling the Message at Perga they came down to Attaleia.

014:026 Thence they sailed to Antioch, where they had previously been
        commended to the grace of God in connexion with the work
        which they had now completed.

014:027 Upon their arrival they called the Church together and proceeded
        to report in detail all that God, working with them, had done,
        and how He had opened for the Gentiles the door of faith.

014:028 And they remained a considerable time in Antioch with the disciples.

015:001 But certain persons who had come down from Judaea tried
        to convince the brethren, saying, "Unless you are circumcised
        in accordance with the Mosaic custom, you cannot be saved."

015:002 Between these new comers and Paul and Barnabas there was
        no little disagreement and controversy, until at last it
        was decided that Paul and Barnabas and some other brethren
        should go up to consult the Apostles and Elders in Jerusalem
        on this matter.

015:003 So they set out, being accompanied for a short distance
        by some other members of the Church; and as they passed
        through Phoenicia and Samaria, they told the whole story
        of the conversion of the Gentiles and inspired all the brethren
        with great joy.

015:004 Upon their arrival in Jerusalem they were cordially received
        by the Church, the Apostles, and the Elders; and they reported
        in detail all that God, working with them, had done.

015:005 But certain men who had belonged to the sect of the Pharisees
        but were now believers, stood up in the assembly, and said,
        "Yes, Gentile believers ought to be circumcised and be ordered
        to keep the Law of Moses."

015:006 Then the Apostles and Elders met to consider the matter;

015:007 and after there had been a long discussion Peter rose to his feet.
        "It is within your own knowledge," he said, "that God originally
        made choice among you that from my lips the Gentiles were
        to hear the Message of the Good News, and believe.

015:008 And God, who knows all hearts, gave His testimony in their favour
        by bestowing the Holy Spirit on them just as He did on us;

015:009 and He made no difference between us and them, in that He
        cleansed their hearts by their faith.

015:010 Now, therefore, why try an experiment upon God, by laying
        on the necks of these disciples a yoke which neither our
        forefathers nor we have been able to bear?

015:011 On the contrary, we believe that it is by the grace of the
        Lord Jesus that we, as well as they, shall be saved."

015:012 Then the whole assembly remained silent while they listened
        to the statement made by Paul and Barnabas as to all
        the signs and marvels that God had done among the Gentiles
        through their instrumentality.

015:013 When they had finished speaking, James said, "Brethren,
        listen to me.

015:014 Symeon has related how God first looked graciously on the Gentiles
        to take from among them a People to be called by His name.

015:015 And this is in harmony with the language of the Prophets, which says:

015:016 "`"Afterwards I will return, and will rebuild David's fallen tent.
        Its ruins I will rebuild, and I will set it up again;

015:017 In order that the rest of mankind may earnestly seek the Lord--
        even all the nations which are called by My name,"

015:018 Says the Lord, who has been making these things known from
        ages long past.'

015:019 "My judgement, therefore, is against inflicting unexpected
        annoyance on those of the Gentiles who are turning to God.

015:020 Yet let us send them written instructions to abstain from
        things polluted by connexion with idolatry, from fornication,
        from meat killed by strangling, and from blood.

015:021 For Moses from the earliest times has had his preachers
        in every town, being read, as he is, Sabbath after Sabbath,
        in the various synagogues."

015:022 Thereupon it was decided by the Apostles and Elders,
        with the approval of the whole Church, to choose suitable
        persons from among themselves and send them to Antioch,
        with Paul and Barnabas.  Judas, called Bar-sabbas, and Silas,
        leading men among the brethren, were selected,

015:023 and they took with them the following letter:  "The Apostles
        and the elder brethren send greeting to the Gentile brethren
        throughout Antioch, Syria and Cilicia.

015:024 As we have been informed that certain persons who have gone
        out from among us have disturbed you by their teaching
        and have unsettled your minds, without having received any
        such instructions from us;

015:025 we have unanimously decided to select certain men and send them
        to you in company with our dear friends Barnabas and Paul,

015:026 who have endangered their very lives for the sake of our
        Lord Jesus Christ.

015:027 We have therefore sent Judas and Silas, who are themselves
        bringing you the same message by word of mouth.

015:028 For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay
        upon you no burden heavier than these necessary requirements--

015:029 You must abstain from things sacrificed to idols,
        from blood, from things strangled, and from fornication.
        Keep yourselves clear of these things, and it will be well
        with you.  Farewell."

015:030 They, therefore, having been solemnly sent, came down
        to Antioch, where they called together the whole assembly
        and delivered the letter.

015:031 The people read it, and were delighted with the comfort
        it brought them.

015:032 And Judas and Silas, being themselves also Prophets,
        gave them a long and encouraging talk, and strengthened them
        in the faith.

015:033 After spending some time there they received an affectionate
        farewell from the brethren to return to those who had sent them.

015:034 []

015:035 But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, teaching and,
        in company with many others, telling the Good News of
        the Lord's Message.

015:036 After a while Paul said to Barnabas, "Suppose we now revisit
        the brethren in the various towns in which we have made known
        the Lord's Message--to see whether they are prospering!"

015:037 Barnabas, however, was bent on taking with them John,
        whose other name was Mark,

015:038 while Paul deemed it undesirable to have as their companion
        one who had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not gone
        on with them to the work.

015:039 So there arose a serious disagreement between them, which resulted
        in their parting from one another, Barnabas taking Mark
        and setting sail for Cyprus.

015:040 But Paul chose Silas as his travelling companion; and set out,
        after being commended by the brethren to the grace of the Lord;

015:041 and he passed through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the Churches.

016:001 He also came to Derbe and to Lystra.  At Lystra he found
        a disciple, Timothy by name--the son of a Christian Jewess,
        though he had a Greek father.

016:002 Timothy was well spoken of by the brethren at Lystra and Iconium,

016:003 and Paul desiring that he should accompany him on his journey,
        took him and circumcised him on account of the Jews in those parts,
        for they all knew that his father was a Greek.

016:004 As they journeyed on from town to town, they handed to the brethren
        for their observance the decisions which had been arrived
        at by the Apostles and Elders in Jerusalem.

016:005 So the Churches went on gaining a stronger faith and growing
        in numbers from day to day.

016:006 Then Paul and his companions passed through Phrygia and Galatia,
        having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to proclaim the Message
        in the province of Asia.

016:007 When they reached the frontier of Mysia, they were about to
        enter Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus would not permit this.

016:008 So, passing along Mysia, they came to Troas.

016:009 Here, one night, Paul saw a vision.  There was a Macedonian
        who was standing, entreating him and saying, "Come over into
        Macedonia and help us."

016:010 So when he had seen the vision, we immediately looked
        out for an opportunity of passing on into Macedonia,
        confidently inferring that God had called us to proclaim
        the Good News to the people there.

016:011 Accordingly we put out to sea from Troas, and ran a straight
        course to Samothrace.  The next day we came to Neapolis,

016:012 and thence to Philippi, which is a city in Macedonia,
        the first in its district, a Roman colony.  And there we
        stayed some little time.

016:013 On the Sabbath we went beyond the city gate to the riverside,
        where we had reason to believe that there was a place for prayer;
        and sitting down we talked with the women who had come together.

016:014 Among our hearers was one named Lydia, a dealer in purple goods.
        She belonged to the city of Thyateira, and was a worshipper
        of the true God.  The Lord opened her heart, so that she gave
        attention to what Paul was saying.

016:015 When she and her household had been baptized, she urged us,
        saying, "If in your judgement I am a believer in the Lord,
        come and stay at my house."  And she made us go there.

016:016 One day, as we were on our way to the place of prayer, a slave
        girl met us who claimed to be inspired and was accustomed
        to bring her owners large profits by telling fortunes.

016:017 She kept following close behind Paul and the rest of us,
        crying aloud, "These men are the bondservants of the Most High God,
        and are proclaiming to you the way of salvation."

016:018 This she persisted in for a considerable time, until Paul,
        wearied out, turned round and said to the spirit, "I command
        you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her."
        And it came out immediately.

016:019 But when her owners saw that their hopes of gain were gone,
        they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them off to the magistrates
        in the public square.

016:020 Then they brought them before the praetors.  "These men,"
        they said, "are creating a great disturbance in our city.

016:021 They are Jews, and are teaching customs which we, as Romans,
        are not permitted to adopt or practise."

016:022 The crowd, too, joined in the outcry against them, till at length
        the praetors ordered them to be stripped and beaten with rods;

016:023 and, after severely flogging them, they threw them into jail
        and bade the jailer keep them safely.

016:024 He, having received an order like that, lodged them in the
        inner prison, and secured their feet in the stocks.

016:025 About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns
        to God, and the prisoners were listening to them,

016:026 when suddenly there was such a violent shock of earthquake
        that the prison shook to its foundations.  Instantly the doors
        all flew open, and the chains fell off from every prisoner.

016:027 Starting up from sleep and seeing the doors of the jail wide open,
        the jailer drew his sword and was on the point of killing himself,
        supposing that the prisoners had escaped.

016:028 But Paul shouted loudly to him, saying, "Do yourself no injury:
        we are all here.

016:029 Then, calling for lights, he sprang in and fell trembling
        at the feet of Paul and Silas;

016:030 and, bringing them out of the prison, he exclaimed, "O sirs,
        what must I do to be saved?"

016:031 "Believe on the Lord Jesus," they replied, "and both you
        and your household will be saved."

016:032 And they told the Lord's Message to him as well as to all
        who were in his house.

016:033 Then he took them, even at that time of night, washed their wounds,
        and he and all his household were immediately baptized;

016:034 and bringing the Apostles up into his house, he spread a meal
        for them, and was filled with gladness, with his whole household,
        his faith resting on God.

016:035 In the morning the praetors sent their lictors with the order,
        "Release those men."

016:036 So the jailer brought Paul word, saying, "The praetors have sent
        orders for you to be released.  Now therefore you can go,
        and proceed on your way in peace."

016:037 But Paul said to them, "After cruelly beating us in public,
        without trial, Roman citizens though we are, they have thrown us
        into prison, and are they now going to send us away privately?
        No, indeed!  Let them come in person and fetch us out."

016:038 This answer the lictors took back to the praetors, who were alarmed
        when they were told that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens.

016:039 Accordingly they came and apologized to them; and, bringing them out,
        asked them to leave the city.

016:040 Then Paul and Silas, having come out of the prison, went to
        Lydia's house; and, after seeing the brethren and encouraging them,
        they left Philippi.

017:001 Then, passing through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they went
        to Thessalonica.  Here there was a synagogue of the Jews.

017:002 Paul--following his usual custom--betook himself to it,
        and for three successive Sabbaths reasoned with them
        from the Scriptures,

017:003 which he clearly explained, pointing out that it had been
        necessary for the Christ to suffer and rise again from the dead,
        and insisting, "The Jesus whom I am announcing to you
        is the Christ."

017:004 Some of the people were won over, and attached themselves
        to Paul and Silas, including many God-fearing Greeks and not
        a few gentlewomen of high rank.

017:005 But the jealousy of the Jews was aroused, and, calling to
        their aid some ill-conditioned and idle fellows, they got
        together a riotous mob and filled the city with uproar.
        They then attacked the house of Jason and searched for Paul
        and Silas, to bring them out before the assembly of people.

017:006 But, failing to find them, they dragged Jason and some of the other
        brethren before the magistrates of the city, loudly accusing them.
        "These men," they said, "who have raised a tumult throughout
        the Empire, have come here also.

017:007 Jason has received them into his house; and they all set Caesar's
        authority at defiance, declaring that there is another Emperor--
        one called Jesus."

017:008 Great was the excitement among the crowd, and among the magistrates
        of the city, when they heard these charges.

017:009 They required Jason and the rest to find substantial bail,
        and after that they let them go.

017:010 The brethren at once sent Paul and Silas away by night to Beroea,
        and they, on their arrival, went to the synagogue of the Jews.

017:011 The Jews at Beroea were of a nobler disposition than those
        in Thessalonica, for they very readily received the Message,
        and day after day searched the Scriptures to see whether it
        was as Paul stated.

017:012 As the result many of them became believers, and so did not
        a few of the Greeks--gentlewomen of good position, and men.

017:013 As soon, however, as the Jews of Thessalonica learnt
        that God's Message had been proclaimed by Paul at Beroea,
        they came there also, and incited the mob to a riot.

017:014 Then the brethren promptly sent Paul down to the sea-coast,
        but Silas and Timothy remained behind.

017:015 Those who were caring for Paul's safety went with him as far
        as Athens, and then left him, taking a message from him to Silas
        and Timothy, asking them to join him as speedily as possible.

017:016 While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was stirred
        within him when he noticed that the city was full of idols.

017:017 So he had discussions in the synagogue with the Jews and
        the other worshippers, and in the market place, day after day,
        with those whom he happened to meet.

017:018 A few of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also encountered him.
        Some of them asked, "What has this beggarly babbler to say?"
        "His business," said others, "seems to be to cry up
        some foreign gods."  This was because he had been telling
        the Good News of Jesus and the Resurrection.

017:019 Then they took him and brought him up to the Areopagus, asking him,
        "May we be told what this new teaching of yours is?

017:020 For the things you are saying sound strange to us.
        We should therefore like to be told exactly what they mean."

017:021 (For all the Athenians and their foreign visitors used to devote
        their whole leisure to telling or hearing about something new.)

017:022 So Paul, taking his stand in the centre of the Areopagus,
        spoke as follows:  "Men of Athens, I perceive that you are
        in every respect remarkably religious.

017:023 For as I passed along and observed the things you worship, I found
        also an altar bearing the inscription, `TO AN UNKNOWN GOD.'
        "The Being, therefore, whom you, without knowing Him, revere,
        Him I now proclaim to you.

017:024 GOD who made the universe and everything in it--He, being Lord
        of Heaven and earth, does not dwell in sanctuaries built by men.

017:025 Nor is He ministered to by human hands, as though He needed anything--
        but He Himself gives to all men life and breath and all things.

017:026 He caused to spring from one forefather people of every race,
        for them to live on the whole surface of the earth, and marked
        out for them an appointed span of life and the boundaries
        of their homes;

017:027 that they might seek God, if perhaps they could grope for Him
        and find Him.  Yes, though He is not far from any one of us.

017:028 For it is in closest union with Him that we live and move
        and have our being; as in fact some of the poets in repute
        among yourselves have said, `For we are also His offspring.'

017:029 Since then we are God's offspring, we ought not to imagine
        that His nature resembles gold or silver or marble, or anything
        sculptured by the art and inventive faculty of man.

017:030 Those times of ignorance God viewed with indulgence.
        But now He commands all men everywhere to repent,

017:031 seeing that He has appointed a day on which, before long,
        He will judge the world in righteousness, through the
        instrumentality of a man whom He has pre-destined to this work,
        and has made the fact certain to every one by raising Him
        from the dead."

017:032 When they heard Paul speak of a resurrection of dead men,
        some began to scoff.  But others said, "We will hear you
        again on that subject."

017:033 So Paul went away from them.

017:034 A few, however, attached themselves to him and believed,
        among them being Dionysius a member of the Council,
        a gentlewoman named Damaris, and some others.

018:001 After this he left Athens and came to Corinth.

018:002 Here he found a Jew, a native of Pontus, of the name of Aquila.
        He and his wife Priscilla had recently come from Italy
        because of Claudius's edict expelling all the Jews from Rome.
        So Paul paid them a visit;

018:003 and because he was of the same trade--that of tent-maker--
        he lodged with them and worked with them.

018:004 But, Sabbath after Sabbath, he preached in the synagogue
        and tried to win over both Jews and Greeks.

018:005 Now at the time when Silas and Timothy came down from
        Macedonia, Paul was preaching fervently and was solemnly
        telling the Jews that Jesus is the Christ.

018:006 But upon their opposing him with abusive language,
        he shook his clothes by way of protest, and said to them,
        "Your ruin will be upon your own heads.  I am not responsible:
        in future I will go among the Gentiles."

018:007 So he left the place and went to the house of a person
        called Titius Justus, a worshipper of the true God.
        His house was next door to the synagogue.

018:008 And Crispus, the Warden of the synagogue, believed in the Lord,
        and so did all his household; and from time to time many of
        the Corinthians who heard Paul believed and received baptism.

018:009 And, in a vision by night, the Lord said to Paul, "Dismiss
        your fears:  go on speaking, and do not give up.

018:010 I am with you, and no one shall attack you to injure you;
        for I have very many people in this city."

018:011 So Paul remained in Corinth for a year and six months,
        teaching among them the Message of God.

018:012 But when Gallio became Proconsul of Greece, the Jews with one accord
        made a dead set at Paul, and brought him before the court.

018:013 "This man," they said, "is inducing people to offer unlawful
        worship to God."

018:014 But, when Paul was about to begin his defence, Gallio said
        to the Jews, "If it had been some wrongful act or piece of
        cunning knavery I might reasonably have listened to you Jews.

018:015 But since these are questions about words and names and your Law,
        you yourselves must see to them.  I refuse to be a judge
        in such matters."

018:016 So he ordered them out of court.

018:017 Then the people all set upon Sosthenes, the Warden of
        the synagogue, and beat him severely in front of the court.
        Gallio did not concern himself in the least about this.

018:018 After remaining a considerable time longer in Corinth, Paul took
        leave of the brethren and set sail for Syria; and Priscilla
        and Aquila were with him.  He had shaved his head at Cenchreae,
        because he was bound by a vow.

018:019 They put in at Ephesus, and there Paul left his companions behind.
        As for himself, he went to the synagogue and had a discussion
        with the Jews.

018:020 When they asked him to remain longer he did not consent,

018:021 but took leave of them with the promise, "I will return to you,
        God willing."  So he set sail from Ephesus.

018:022 Landing at Caesarea, he went up to Jerusalem and inquired after
        the welfare of the Church, and then went down to Antioch.

018:023 After spending some time in Antioch, Paul set out on a tour,
        visiting the whole of Galatia and Phrygia in order,
        and strengthening all the disciples.

018:024 Meanwhile a Jew named Apollos came to Ephesus.  He was a native
        of Alexandria, a man of great learning and well versed
        in the Scriptures.

018:025 He had been instructed by word of mouth in the way of
        the Lord, and, being full of burning zeal, he used to speak
        and teach accurately the facts about Jesus, though he knew
        of no baptism but John's.

018:026 He began to speak boldly in the synagogue, and Priscilla
        and Aquila, after hearing him, took him home and explained
        God's way to him more accurately.

018:027 Then, as he had made up his mind to cross over into Greece,
        the brethren wrote to the disciples in Corinth begging them
        to give him a kindly welcome.  Upon his arrival he rendered
        valuable help to those who through grace had believed;

018:028 for he powerfully and in public overcame the Jews in argument,
        proving to them from the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ.

019:001 During the stay of Apollos in Corinth, Paul, after passing
        through the inland districts, came to Ephesus, where he found
        a few disciples.

019:002 "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you first believed?"
        he asked them.  "No," they replied, "we did not even hear
        that there is a Holy Spirit."

019:003 "Into what then were you baptized?" he asked.
        "Into John's baptism," they replied.

019:004 "John," he said, "administered a baptism of repentance,
        bidding the people believe on One who was to come after him;
        namely, on Jesus."

019:005 On hearing this, they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus;

019:006 and when Paul laid his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came
        on them, and they began to speak in tongues and to prophesy.

019:007 They numbered in all about twelve men.

019:008 Afterwards he went into the synagogue.  There for three months
        he continued to preach fearlessly, explaining in words which
        carried conviction the truths which concern the Kingdom of God.

019:009 But some grew obstinate in unbelief and spoke evil of the new
        faith before all the congregation.  So Paul left them, and,
        taking with him those who were disciples, held discussions
        daily in Tyrannus's lecture-hall.

019:010 This went on for two years, so that all the inhabitants
        of the province of Asia, Jews as well as Greeks,
        heard the Lord's Message.

019:011 God also brought about extraordinary miracles through
        Paul's instrumentality.

019:012 Towels or aprons, for instance, which Paul had handled used to be
        carried to the sick, and they recovered from their ailments,
        or the evil spirits left them.

019:013 But there were also some wandering Jewish exorcists who undertook
        to invoke the name of Jesus over those who had the evil spirits,
        saying, "I command you by that Jesus whom Paul preaches."

019:014 There were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew of high-priestly family,
        who were doing this.

019:015 "Jesus I know," the evil spirit answered, "and Paul I have
        heard of, but who are you?"

019:016 And the man in whom the evil spirit was sprang on two of them,
        over-mastered them both, and treated them with such violence,
        that they fled from the house stripped of their clothes and wounded.

019:017 All the people of Ephesus, Jews as well as Greeks, came to know
        of this.  There was widespread terror, and they began to hold
        the name of the Lord Jesus in high honour.

019:018 Many also of those who believed came confessing without reserve
        what their conduct had been,

019:019 and not a few of those who had practised magical arts brought
        their books together and burnt them in the presence of all.
        The total value was reckoned and found to be 50,000 silver coins.

019:020 Thus mightily did the Lord's Message spread and triumph!

019:021 When matters had reached this point, Paul decided in his own mind
        to travel through Macedonia and Greece, and go to Jerusalem.
        "After that," he said, "I must also see Rome."

019:022 But he sent two of his assistants, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia,
        while he himself remained for a while in Roman Asia.

019:023 Now just at that time there arose no small commotion about
        the new faith.

019:024 There was a certain Demetrius, a silversmith, who made miniature
        silver sanctuaries of Diana, a business which brought great
        gain to the mechanics in his employ.

019:025 He called his workmen together, and others who were engaged
        in similar trades, and said to them, "You men well know
        that our prosperity depends on this business of ours;

019:026 and you see and hear that, not in Ephesus only but throughout
        almost the whole province of Asia, this fellow Paul has led
        away a vast number of people by inducing them to believe
        that they are not gods at all that are made by men's hands.

019:027 There is danger, therefore, not only that this our trade will
        become of no account, but also that the temple of the great
        goddess Diana will fall into utter disrepute, and that before
        long she will be actually deposed from her majestic rank--
        she who is now worshipped by the whole province of Asia;
        nay, by the whole world."

019:028 After listening to this harangue, they became furiously angry
        and kept calling out, "Great is the Ephesian Diana!"

019:029 The riot and uproar spread through the whole city,
        till at last with one accord they rushed into the Theatre,
        dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus, two Macedonians
        who were fellow travellers with Paul.

019:030 Then Paul would have liked to go in and address the people,
        but the disciples would not let him do so.

019:031 A few of the public officials, too, who were friendly to him,
        sent repeated messages entreating him not to venture
        into the Theatre.

019:032 The people, meanwhile, kept shouting, some one thing and
        some another; for the assembly was all uproar and confusion,
        and the greater part had no idea why they had come together.

019:033 Then some of the people crowded round Alexander, whom the Jews
        had pushed forward; and Alexander, motioning with his hand
        to get silence, was prepared to make a defence to the people.

019:034 No sooner, however, did they see that he was a Jew, than there arose
        from them all one roar of shouting, lasting about two hours.
        "Great is the Ephesian Diana," they said.

019:035 At length the Recorder quieted them down.  "Men of Ephesus,"
        he said, "who is there of all mankind that needs to be told
        that the city of Ephesus is the guardian of the temple of
        the great Diana and of the image which fell down from Zeus?

019:036 These facts, then, being unquestioned, it becomes you to maintain
        your self-control and not act recklessly.

019:037 For you have brought these men here, who are neither robbers
        of temples nor blasphemers of our goddess.

019:038 If, however, Demetrius and the mechanics who support his
        contention have a grievance against any one, there are
        Assize-days and there are Proconsuls:  let the persons
        interested accuse one another.

019:039 But if you desire anything further, it will have to be settled
        in the regular assembly.

019:040 For in connexion with to-day's proceedings there is danger
        of our being charged with attempted insurrection, there having
        been no real reason for this riot; nor shall we be able
        to justify the behaviour of this disorderly mob."

019:041 With these words he dismissed the assembly.

020:001 When the uproar had ceased, Paul sent for the disciples;
        and, after speaking words of encouragement to them, he took
        his leave, and started for Macedonia.

020:002 Passing through those districts he encouraged the disciples
        in frequent addresses, and then came into Greece, and spent
        three months there.

020:003 The Jews having planned to waylay him whenever he might be
        on the point of taking ship for Syria, he decided to travel
        back by way of Macedonia.

020:004 He was accompanied as far as the province of Asia by Sopater
        the Beroean, the son of Pyrrhus; by the Thessalonians,
        Aristarchus and Secundus; by Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy;
        and by the Asians, Tychicus and Trophimus.

020:005 These brethren had gone on and were waiting for us in the Troad.

020:006 But we ourselves sailed from Philippi after the days of
        Unleavened Bread, and five days later joined them in the Troad,
        where we remained for a week.

020:007 On the first day of the week, when we had met to break bread,
        Paul, who was going away the next morning, was preaching to them,
        and prolonged his discourse till midnight.

020:008 Now there were a good many lamps in the room upstairs where
        we all were,

020:009 and a youth of the name of Eutychus was sitting at the window.
        This lad, gradually sinking into deep sleep while Paul
        preached at unusual length, overcome at last by sleep,
        fell from the second floor and was taken up dead.

020:010 Paul, however, went down, threw himself upon him,
        and folding him in his arms said, "Do not be alarmed;
        his life is still in him."

020:011 Then he went upstairs again, broke bread, and took some food;
        and after a long conversation which was continued till daybreak,
        at last he parted from them.

020:012 They had taken the lad home alive, and were greatly comforted.

020:013 The rest of us had already gone on board a ship, and now we
        set sail for Assos, intending to take Paul on board there;
        for so he had arranged, he himself intending to go by land.

020:014 Accordingly, when he met us at Assos, we took him on board
        and came to Mitylene.

020:015 Sailing from there, we arrived the next day off Chios.
        On the next we touched at Samos; and on the day
        following reached Miletus.

020:016 For Paul's plan was to sail past Ephesus, so as not to spend much
        time in the province of Asia; since he was very desirous of being
        in Jerusalem, if possible, on the day of the Harvest Festival.

020:017 From Miletus he sent to Ephesus for the Elders of the Church
        to come to him.

020:018 Upon their arrival he said to them, "You Elders well know,
        from the first day of my setting foot in the province of Asia,
        the kind of life I lived among you the whole time,

020:019 serving the Lord in all humility, and with tears, and amid
        trials which came upon me through the plotting of the Jews--

020:020 and that I never shrank from declaring to you anything that
        was profitable, or from teaching you in public and in your homes,

020:021 and urging upon both Jews and Greeks the necessity of turning
        to God and of believing in Jesus our Lord.

020:022 "And now, impelled by a sense of duty, I am on my way to Jerusalem,
        not knowing what will happen to me there,

020:023 except that the Holy Spirit, at town after town, testifies to me
        that imprisonment and suffering are awaiting me.

020:024 But even the sacrifice of my life I count as nothing, if only I
        may perfect my earthly course, and be faithful to the duty
        which the Lord Jesus has entrusted to me of proclaiming,
        as of supreme importance, the Good News of God's grace.

020:025 "And now, I know that none of you among whom I have gone
        in and out proclaiming the coming of the Kingdom will any
        longer see my face.

020:026 Therefore I protest to you to-day that I am not responsible
        for the ruin of any one of you.

020:027 For I have not shrunk from declaring to you God's whole truth.

020:028 "Take heed to yourselves and to all the flock among which
        the Holy Spirit has placed you to take the oversight for Him
        and act as shepherds to the Church of God, which He has bought
        with His own blood.

020:029 I know that, when I am gone, cruel wolves will come among you
        and will not spare the flock;

020:030 and that from among your own selves men will rise up who will seek
        with their perverse talk to draw away the disciples after them.

020:031 Therefore be on the alert; and remember that, night and day,
        for three years, I never ceased admonishing every one,
        even with tears.

020:032 "And now I commend you to God and to the word of His grace.
        He is able to build you up and to give you your inheritance
        among His people.

020:033 No one's silver or gold or clothing have I coveted.

020:034 You yourselves know that these hands of mine have provided
        for my own necessities and for the people with me.

020:035 In all things I have set you an example, showing you that,
        by working as I do, you ought to help the weak, and to bear
        in mind the words of the Lord Jesus, how He Himself said,
        "`It is more blessed to give than to receive.'"

020:036 Having spoken thus, Paul knelt down and prayed with them all;

020:037 and with loud lamentation they all threw their arms round his neck,
        and kissed him lovingly,

020:038 grieved above all things at his having told them that
        after that day they were no longer to see his face.
        And they went with him to the ship.

021:001 When, at last, we had torn ourselves away and had set sail,
        we ran in a straight course to Cos; the next day to Rhodes,
        and from there to Patara.

021:002 Finding a ship bound for Phoenicia, we went on board and
        put to sea.

021:003 After sighting Cyprus and leaving that island on our left,
        we continued our voyage to Syria and put in at Tyre;
        for there the ship was to unload her cargo.

021:004 Having searched for the disciples and found them,
        we stayed at Tyre for seven days; and, taught by the Spirit,
        they repeatedly urged Paul not to proceed to Jerusalem.

021:005 When, however, our time was up, we left and went on our way,
        all the disciples and their wives and children coming to see
        us off.  Then, after kneeling down on the beach and praying,

021:006 we took leave of one another; and we went on board,
        while they returned home.

021:007 As for us, our voyage was over when having sailed from Tyre
        we reached Ptolemais.  here we inquired after the welfare
        of the brethren, and remained a day with them.

021:008 On the morrow we left Ptolemais and went on to Caesarea,
        where we came to the house of Philip the Evangelist,
        who was one of the seven, and stayed with him.

021:009 Now Philip had four unmarried daughters who were prophetesses;

021:010 and during our somewhat lengthy stay a Prophet of the name
        of Agabus came down from Judaea.

021:011 When he arrived he took Paul's loincloth, and bound his own feet
        and arms with it, and said, "Thus says the Holy Spirit, `So will
        the Jews in Jerusalem bind the owner of this loincloth,
        and will hand him over to the Gentiles.'"

021:012 As soon as we heard these words, both we and the brethren
        at Caesarea entreated Paul not to go up to Jerusalem.

021:013 His reply was, "What can you mean by thus breaking my heart
        with your grief?  Why, as for me, I am ready not only to go
        to Jerusalem and be put in chains, but even to die there
        for the sake of the Lord Jesus."

021:014 So when he was not to be dissuaded, we ceased remonstrating
        with him and said, "The Lord's will be done!"

021:015 A few days afterwards we loaded our baggage-cattle and continued
        our journey to Jerusalem.

021:016 Some of the disciples from Caesarea also joined our party,
        and brought with them Mnason, a Cyprian, one of the early disciples,
        at whose house we were to lodge.

021:017 At length we reached Jerusalem, and there the brethren gave
        us a hearty welcome.

021:018 On the following day we went with Paul to call on James,
        and all the Elders of the Church came also.

021:019 After exchanging friendly greetings, Paul told in detail all that
        God had done among the Gentiles through his instrumentality.

021:020 And they, when they had heard his statement, gave the glory to God.
        Then they said, "You see, brother, how many tens of thousands
        of Jews there are among those who have accepted the faith,
        and they are all zealous upholders of the Law.

021:021 Now what they have been repeatedly told about you is that you
        teach all the Jews among the Gentiles to abandon Moses,
        and that you forbid them to circumcise their children
        or observe old-established customs.

021:022 What then ought you to do?  They are sure to hear that you
        have come to Jerusalem;

021:023 so do this which we now tell you.  We have four men here who
        have a vow resting on them.

021:024 Associate with these men and purify yourself with them,
        and pay their expenses so that they can shave their heads.
        Then everybody will know that there is no truth in these
        stories about you, but that in your own actions you yourself
        scrupulously obey the Law.

021:025 But as for the Gentiles who have accepted the faith, we have
        communicated to them our decision that they are carefully
        to abstain from anything sacrificed to an idol, from blood,
        from what is strangled, and from fornication."

021:026 So Paul associated with the men; and the next day,
        having purified himself with them, he went into the Temple,
        giving every one to understand that the days of their purification
        were finished, and there he remained until the sacrifice
        for each of them was offered.

021:027 But, when the seven days were nearly over, the Jews from
        the province of Asia, having seen Paul in the Temple,
        set about rousing the fury of all the people against him.

021:028 They laid hands on him, crying out, "Men of Israel, help! help!
        This is the man who goes everywhere preaching to everybody
        against the Jewish people and the Law and this place.
        And besides, he has even brought Gentiles into the Temple
        and has desecrated this holy place."

021:029 (For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian with
        him in the city, and imagined that Paul had brought him
        into the Temple.)

021:030 The excitement spread through the whole city, and the people rushed
        in crowds to the Temple, and there laid hold of Paul and began
        to drag him out; and the Temple gates were immediately closed.

021:031 But while they were trying to kill Paul, word was taken up
        to the Tribune in command of the battalion, that all Jerusalem
        was in a ferment.

021:032 He instantly sent for a few soldiers and their officers,
        and came down among the people with all speed.  At the sight
        of the Tribune and the troops they ceased beating Paul.

021:033 Then the Tribune, making his way to him, arrested him,
        and, having ordered him to be secured with two chains,
        proceeded to ask who he was and what he had been doing.

021:034 Some of the crowd shouted one accusation against Paul
        and some another, until, as the uproar made it impossible
        for the truth to be ascertained with certainty, the Tribune
        ordered him to be brought into the barracks.

021:035 When Paul was going up the steps, he had to be carried
        by the soldiers because of the violence of the mob;

021:036 for the whole mass of the people pressed on in the rear,
        shouting, "Away with him!"

021:037 When he was about to be taken into the barracks, Paul said
        to the Tribune, "May I speak to you?"  "Do you know Greek?"
        the Tribune asked.

021:038 "Are you not the Egyptian who some years ago excited the riot
        of the 4,000 cut-throats, and led them out into the Desert?"

021:039 "I am a Jew," replied Paul, "belonging to Tarsus in Cilicia,
        and am a citizen of no unimportant city.  Give me leave,
        I pray you, to speak to the people."

021:040 So with his permission Paul stood on the steps and motioned
        with his hand to the people to be quiet; and when there was
        perfect silence he addressed them in Hebrew.

022:001 "Brethren and fathers," he said, "listen to my defence which I
        now make before you."

022:002 And on hearing him address them in Hebrew, they kept all
        the more quiet; and he said,

022:003 "I am a Jew, born at Tarsus in Cilicia, but brought up in
        this city.  I was carefully trained at the feet of Gamaliel
        in the Law of our forefathers, and, like all of you to-day,
        was zealous for God.

022:004 I persecuted to death this new faith, continually binding
        both men and women and throwing them into prison;

022:005 as the High Priest also and all the Elders can bear me witness.
        It was, too, from them that I received letters to the brethren
        in Damascus, and I was already on my way to Damascus,
        intending to bring those also who had fled there, in chains
        to Jerusalem, to be punished.

022:006 "But on my way, when I was now not far from Damascus, about noon
        a sudden blaze of light from Heaven shone round me.

022:007 I fell to the ground and heard a voice say to me, "`Saul, Saul,
        why are you persecuting Me?'

022:008 "`Who art thou, Lord?'  I asked.  "`I am Jesus,
        the Nazarene,' He replied, `whom you are persecuting.'

022:009 "Now the men who were with me, though they saw the light,
        did not hear the words of Him who spoke to me.

022:010 And I asked, "`What am I to do, Lord?'  "And the Lord said
        to me, "`Rise, and go into Damascus.  There you shall be told
        of all that has been appointed for you to do.'

022:011 "And as I could not see because the light had been so dazzling,
        those who were with me had to lead me by the arm, and so I
        came to Damascus.

022:012 "And a certain Ananias, a pious man who obeyed the Law and bore
        a good character with all the Jews of the city,

022:013 came to me and standing at my side said, "`Brother Saul,
        recover your sight.'  "I instantly regained my sight and looked
        up at him.

022:014 Then he said, `The God of our forefathers has appointed you to know
        His will, and to see the righteous One and hear Him speak.

022:015 For you shall be a witness for Him, to all men, of what you
        have seen and heard.

022:016 And now why delay?  Rise, get yourself baptized, and wash off
        your sins, calling upon His name.'

022:017 "After my return to Jerusalem, and while praying in the Temple, I fell
        into a trance.

022:018 I saw Jesus, and He said to me, "`Make haste and leave
        Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your
        testimony about Me.'

022:019 "`Lord,' I replied, `they themselves well know how active I was
        in imprisoning, and in flogging in synagogue after synagogue
        those who believe in Thee;

022:020 and when they were shedding the blood of Stephen, Thy witness,
        I was standing by, fully approving of it, and I held the clothes
        of those who were killing him.'

022:021 "`Go,' He replied; `I will send you as an Apostle to
        nations far away.'"

022:022 Until they heard this last statement the people listened
        to Paul, but now with a roar of disapproval they cried out,
        "Away with such a fellow from the earth!  He ought not to be
        allowed to live."

022:023 And when they continued their furious shouts, throwing their
        clothes into the air and flinging dust about,

022:024 the Tribune ordered him to be brought into the barracks,
        and be examined by flogging, in order to ascertain the reason
        why they thus cried out against him.

022:025 But, when they had tied him up with the straps, Paul said
        to the Captain who stood by, "Does the Law permit you to flog
        a Roman citizen--and one too who is uncondemned?"

022:026 On hearing this question, the Captain went to report the matter
        to the Tribune.  "What are you intending to do?" he said.
        "This man is a Roman citizen."

022:027 So the Tribune came to Paul and asked him, "Tell me, are you
        a Roman citizen?"  "Yes," he said.

022:028 "I paid a large sum for my citizenship," said the Tribune.
        "But I was born free," said Paul.

022:029 So the men who had been on the point of putting him under torture
        immediately left him.  And the Tribune, too, was frightened
        when he learnt that Paul was a Roman citizen, for he had
        had him bound.

022:030 The next day, wishing to know exactly what charge was being
        brought against him by the Jews, the Tribune ordered his chains
        to be removed; and, having sent word to the High Priests and
        all the Sanhedrin to assemble, he brought Paul down and made
        him stand before them.

023:001 Then Paul, fixing a steady gaze on the Sanhedrin, said, "Brethren,
        it is with a perfectly clear conscience that I have discharged
        my duties before God up to this day."

023:002 On hearing this the High Priest Ananias ordered those who were
        standing near Paul to strike him on the mouth.

023:003 "Before long," exclaimed Paul, "God will strike you,
        you white-washed wall!  Are you sitting there to judge me
        in accordance with the Law, and do you yourself actually
        break the Law by ordering me to be struck?"

023:004 "Do you rail at God's High Priest?" cried the men who stood by him.

023:005 "I did not know, brethren," replied Paul, "that he was
        the High Priest; for it is written, `Thou shalt not speak
        evil of a ruler of Thy people.'"

023:006 Noticing, however, that the Sanhedrin consisted partly
        of Sadducees and partly of Pharisees, he called out loudly
        among them, "Brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of Pharisees.
        It is because of my hope of a resurrection of the dead that I
        am on my trial."

023:007 These words of his caused an angry dispute between the Pharisees
        and the Sadducees, and the assembly took different sides.

023:008 For the Sadducees maintain that there is no resurrection,
        and neither angel nor spirit; but the Pharisees acknowledge
        the existence of both.

023:009 So there arose a great uproar; and some of the Scribes
        belonging to the sect of the Pharisees sprang to their feet
        and fiercely contended, saying, "We find no harm in the man.
        What if a spirit has spoken to him, or an angel----!"

023:010 But when the struggle was becoming violent, the Tribune,
        fearing that Paul would be torn to pieces by the people,
        ordered the troops to go down and take him from among them
        by force and bring him into the barracks.

023:011 The following night the Lord came and stood at Paul's side,
        and said, "Be of good courage, for as you have borne faithful
        witness about me in Jerusalem, so you must also bear
        witness in Rome."

023:012 Now, when daylight came, the Jews formed a conspiracy and solemnly
        swore not to eat or drink till they had killed Paul.

023:013 There were more than forty of them who bound themselves
        by this oath.

023:014 They went to the High Priests and Elders and said to them,
        "We have bound ourselves under a heavy curse to take no food
        till we have killed Paul.

023:015 Now therefore you and the Sanhedrin should make representations
        to the Tribune for him to bring him down to you, under the
        impression that you intend to inquire more minutely about him;
        and we are prepared to assassinate him before he comes
        near the place."

023:016 But Paul's sister's son heard of the intended attack upon him.
        So he came and went into the barracks and told Paul about it;

023:017 and Paul called one of the Captains and said, "Take this young
        man to the Tribune, for he has information to give him."

023:018 So he took him and brought him to the Tribune, and said, "Paul,
        the prisoner, called me to him and begged me to bring this
        youth to you, because he has something to say to you."

023:019 Then the Tribune, taking him by the arm, withdrew out of the
        hearing of others and asked him, "What have you to tell me?"

023:020 "The Jews," he replied, "have agreed to request you to bring
        Paul down to the Sanhedrin to-morrow for the purpose of making
        yourself more accurately acquainted with the case.

023:021 I beg you not to comply; for more than forty men among them
        are lying in wait for him, who have solemnly vowed that they
        will neither eat nor drink till they have assassinated him;
        and even now they are ready, in anticipation of receiving
        that promise of you."

023:022 So the Tribune sent the youth home, cautioning him.
        "Do not let any one know that you have given me this information,"
        he said.

023:023 Then, calling to him two of the Captains, he gave his orders.
        "Get ready two hundred men," he said, "to march to Caesarea,
        with seventy cavalry and two hundred light infantry,
        starting at nine o'clock to-night."

023:024 He further told them to provide horses to mount Paul on,
        so as to bring him safely to Felix the Governor.

023:025 He also wrote a letter of which these were the contents:

023:026 "Claudius Lysias to his Excellency, Felix the Governor:
        all good wishes.

023:027 This man Paul had been seized by the Jews, and they were on
        the point of killing him, when I came upon them with the troops
        and rescued him, for I had been informed that he was
        a Roman citizen.

023:028 And, wishing to know with certainty the offense of which they
        were accusing him, I brought him down into their Sanhedrin,

023:029 and I discovered that the charge had to do with questions
        of their Law, but that he was accused of nothing for which
        he deserves death or imprisonment.

023:030 But now that I have received information of an intended attack
        upon him, I immediately send him to you, directing his accusers
        also to state before you the case they have against him."

023:031 So, in obedience to their orders, the soldiers took Paul
        and brought him by night as far as Antipatris.

023:032 The next day the infantry returned to the barracks,
        leaving the cavalry to proceed with him;

023:033 and, the cavalry having reached Caesarea and delivered the letter
        to the Governor, they brought Paul also to him.

023:034 Felix, after reading the letter, inquired from what province he was;
        and being told "from Cilicia,"

023:035 he said, "I will hear all you have to say, when your accusers
        also have come."  And he ordered him to be detained in custody
        in Herod's Palace.

024:001 Five days after this, Ananias the High Priest came down to Caesarea
        with a number of Elders and a pleader called Tertullus.
        They stated to the Governor the case against Paul.

024:002 So Paul was sent for, and Tertullus began to impeach him as follows:
        "Indebted as we are," he said, "to you, most noble Felix,
        for the perfect peace which we enjoy, and for reforms which
        your wisdom has introduced to this nation,

024:003 in every instance and in every place we accept them
        with profound gratitude.

024:004 But--not to detain you too long--I beg you in your forbearance
        to listen to a brief statement from us.

024:005 For we have found this man Paul a source of mischief and a
        disturber of the peace among all the Jews throughout the Empire,
        and a ringleader in the heresy of the Nazarenes.

024:006 He even attempted to profane the Temple, but we arrested him.

024:007 []

024:008 You, however, by examining him, will yourself be able to learn
        the truth as to all this which we allege against him."

024:009 The Jews also joined in the charge, maintaining that
        these were facts.

024:010 Then, at a sign from the Governor, Paul answered, "Knowing, Sir,
        that for many years you have administered justice to this nation,
        I cheerfully make my defence.

024:011 For you have it in your power to ascertain that it is not more
        than twelve days ago that I went up to worship in Jerusalem;

024:012 and that neither in the Temple nor in the synagogues,
        nor anywhere in the city, did they find me disputing with any
        opponent or collecting a crowd about me.

024:013 Nor can they prove the charges which they are now
        bringing against me.

024:014 But this I confess to you--that in the way which they style a heresy,
        I worship the God of our forefathers, believing everything
        that is taught in the Law or is written in the Prophets,

024:015 and having a hope directed towards God, which my accusers
        themselves also entertain, that before long there will be
        a resurrection both of the righteous and the unrighteous.

024:016 This too is my own earnest endeavour--always to have a clear
        conscience in relation to God and man.

024:017 "Now after an interval of several years I came to bring alms
        to my nation, and to offer sacrifices.

024:018 While I was busy about these, they found me in the Temple purified,
        with no crowd around me and no uproar; but there were certain
        Jews from the province of Asia.

024:019 They ought to have been here before you, and to have been
        my prosecutors, if they have any charge to bring against me.

024:020 Or let these men themselves say what misdemeanour they found
        me guilty of when I stood before the Sanhedrin,

024:021 unless it was in that one expression which I made use of when I
        shouted out as I stood among them, "`The resurrection of the dead
        is the thing about which I am on my trial before you to-day.'"

024:022 At this point Felix, who was fairly well informed about the new faith,
        adjourned the trial, saying to the Jews, "When the Tribune Lysias
        comes down, I will enter carefully into the matter."

024:023 And he gave orders to the Captain that Paul was to be kept
        in custody, but be treated with indulgence, and that his personal
        friends were not to be prevented from showing him kindness.

024:024 Not long after this, Felix came with Drusilla his wife,
        a Jewess, and sending for Paul, listened to him as he spoke
        about faith in Christ Jesus.

024:025 But when he dealt with the subjects of justice, self-control,
        and the judgement which was soon to come, Felix became alarmed
        and said, "For the present leave me, and when I can find
        a convenient opportunity I will send for you."

024:026 At the same time he hoped that Paul would give him money;
        and for this reason he sent for him the oftener to
        converse with him.

024:027 But after the lapse of fully two years Felix was succeeded
        by Porcius Festus; and being desirous of gratifying
        the Jews, Felix left Paul still in prison.

025:001 Festus, having entered on his duties as governor of the province,
        two days later went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem.

025:002 The High Priests and the leading men among the Jews immediately
        made representations to him against Paul, and begged him--

025:003 asking it as a favour, to Paul's prejudice--to have him
        brought to Jerusalem.  They were planning an ambush to kill
        him on the way.

025:004 Festus, however, replied that Paul was in custody in Caesarea,
        and that he was himself going there very soon.

025:005 "Therefore let those of you," he said, "who can come,
        go down with me, and impeach the man, if there is anything
        amiss in him."

025:006 After a stay of eight or ten days in Jerusalem--not more--
        he went down to Caesarea; and the next day, taking his seat
        on the tribunal, he ordered Paul to be brought in.

025:007 Upon Paul's arrival, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem
        stood round him, and brought many grave charges against him
        which they were unable to substantiate.

025:008 But, in reply, Paul said, "Neither against the Jewish Law,
        nor against the Temple, nor against Caesar, have I committed
        any offence whatever."

025:009 Then Festus, being anxious to gratify the Jews, asked Paul, "Are you
        willing to go up to Jerusalem, and there stand your trial
        before me on these charges?"

025:010 "I am standing before Caesar's tribunal," replied Paul,
        "where alone I ought to be tried.  The Jews have no real
        ground of complaint against me, as in fact you yourself are
        beginning to see more clearly.

025:011 If, however, I have done wrong and have committed any offence for
        which I deserve to die, I do not ask to be excused that penalty.
        But if there is no truth in what these men allege against me,
        no one has the right to give me up to them as a favour.
        I appeal to Caesar."

025:012 Then, after conferring with the Council, Festus replied,
        "To Caesar you have appealed:  to Caesar you shall go."

025:013 A short time after this, Agrippa the king and Bernice came
        to Caesarea to pay a complimentary visit to Festus;

025:014 and, during their rather long stay, Festus laid Paul's case
        before the king.  "There is a man here," he said, "whom Felix
        left a prisoner,

025:015 about whom, when I went to Jerusalem, the High Priests
        and the Elders of the Jews made representations to me,
        begging that sentence might be pronounced against him.

025:016 My reply was that it is not the custom among the Romans to give up
        any one for punishment before the accused has had his accusers
        face to face, and has had an opportunity of defending himself
        against the charge which has been brought against him.

025:017 "When, therefore, a number of them came here, the next day
        I took my seat on the tribunal, without any loss of time,
        and ordered the man to be brought in.

025:018 But, when his accusers stood up, they did not charge him
        with the misdemeanours of which I had been suspecting him.

025:019 But they quarrelled with him about certain matters connected
        with their own religion, and about one Jesus who had died, but--
        so Paul persistently maintained--is now alive.

025:020 I was at a loss how to investigate such questions, and asked
        Paul whether he would care to go to Jerusalem and there stand
        his trial on these matters.

025:021 But when Paul appealed to have his case kept for the Emperor's
        decision, I ordered him to be kept in prison until I could
        send him up to Caesar."

025:022 "I should like to hear the man myself," said Agrippa.
        "to-morrow," replied Festus, "you shall."  Accordingly, the next day,
        Agrippa and Bernice came in state

025:023 and took their seats in the Judgement Hall, attended by the Tribunes
        and the men of high rank in the city; and, at the command
        of Festus, Paul was brought in.

025:024 Then Festus said, "King Agrippa and all who are present
        with us, you see here the man about whom the whole nation
        of the Jews made suit to me, both in Jerusalem and here,
        crying out that he ought not to live any longer.

025:025 I could not discover that he had done anything for which he deserved
        to die; but as he has himself appealed to the Emperor, I have
        decided to send him to Rome.

025:026 I have nothing very definite, however, to tell our Sovereign
        about him.  So I have brought the man before you all--
        and especially before you, King Agrippa--that after he has been
        examined I may find something which I can put into writing.

025:027 For, when sending a prisoner to Rome, it seems to me to be
        absurd not to state the charges against him."

026:001 Then Agrippa said to Paul, "You have permission to speak
        about yourself."  So Paul, with outstretched arm, proceeded to
        make his defence.

026:002 "As regards all the accusations brought against me by the Jews,"
        he said, "I think myself fortunate, King Agrippa, in being
        about to defend myself to-day before you,

026:003 who are so familiar with all the customs and speculations
        that prevail among the Jews; and for this reason, I pray you,
        give me a patient hearing.

026:004 "The kind of life I have lived from my youth upwards,
        as exemplified in my early days among my nation and in Jerusalem,
        is known to all the Jews.

026:005 For they all know me of old--if they would but testify to the fact--
        how, being an adherent of the strictest sect of our religion,
        my life was that of a Pharisee.

026:006 And now I stand here impeached because of my hope in the fulfilment
        of the promise made by God to our forefathers--

026:007 the promise which our twelve tribes, worshipping day and night
        with intense devotedness, hope to have made good to them.
        It is on the subject of this hope, Sir, that I am accused
        by the Jews.

026:008 Why is it deemed with all of you a thing past belief if God
        raises the dead to life?

026:009 "I myself, however, thought it a duty to do many things
        in hostility to the name of Jesus, the Nazarene.

026:010 And that was how I acted in Jerusalem.  Armed with authority
        received from the High Priests I shut up many of God's people
        in various prisons, and when they were about to be put to death
        I gave my vote against them.

026:011 In all the synagogues also I punished them many a time,
        and tried to make them blaspheme; and in my wild fury I chased
        them even to foreign towns.

026:012 "While thus engaged, I was travelling one day to Damascus armed
        with authority and a commission from the High Priests,

026:013 and on the journey, at noon, Sir, I saw a light from Heaven--
        brighter than the brightness of the sun--shining around me
        and around those who were travelling with me.

026:014 We all fell to the ground; and I heard a voice which said to me
        in Hebrew, "`Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?  You are
        finding it painful to kick against the ox-goad.'

026:015 "`Who art Thou, Lord?'  I asked.  "`I am Jesus whom you
        are persecuting,' the Lord replied.

026:016 `But rise, and stand on your feet; for I have appeared to you
        for the very purpose of appointing you My servant and My
        witness both as to the things you have already seen and as
        to those in which I will appear to you.

026:017 I will save you from the Jewish people and from the Gentiles,
        to whom I send you to open their eyes,

026:018 that they may turn from darkness to light and from the obedience
        to Satan to God, in order to receive forgiveness of sins
        and an inheritance among those who are sanctified through
        faith in Me.'

026:019 "Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to
        the heavenly vision;

026:020 but I proceeded to preach first to the people in Damascus,
        and then to those in Jerusalem and in all Judaea,
        and to the Gentiles, that they must repent and turn to God,
        and live lives consistent with such repentance.

026:021 "It was on this account that the Jews seized me in the Temple
        and tried to kill me.

026:022 Having, however, obtained the help which is from God, I have stood
        firm until now, and have solemnly exhorted rich and poor alike,
        saying nothing except what the Prophets and Moses predicted
        as soon to happen,

026:023 since the Christ was to be a suffering Christ, and by coming back
        from the dead was then to be the first to proclaim a message
        of light both to the Jewish people and to the Gentiles."

026:024 As Paul thus made his defence, Festus exclaimed in a loud voice,
        "You are raving mad, Paul; and great learning is driving you mad."

026:025 "I am not mad, most noble Festus," replied Paul; "I am speaking
        words of sober truth.

026:026 For the King, to whom I speak freely, knows about these matters.
        I am not to be persuaded that any detail of them has escaped
        his notice; for these things have not been done in a corner.

026:027 King Agrippa, do you believe the Prophets?  I know that
        you believe them."

026:028 Agrippa answered, "In brief, you are doing your best to persuade
        me to become a Christian."

026:029 "My prayer to God, whether briefly or at length," replied Paul,
        "would be that not only you but all who are my hearers to-day,
        might become such as I am--except these chains."

026:030 So the King rose, and the Governor, and Bernice, and those
        who were sitting with them;

026:031 and, having withdrawn, they talked to one another and said,
        "This man is doing nothing for which he deserves
        death or imprisonment."

026:032 And Agrippa said to Festus, "He might have been set at liberty,
        if he had not appealed to Caesar."

027:001 Now when it was decided that we should sail for Italy, they handed
        over Paul and a few other prisoners into the custody of Julius,
        a Captain of the Augustan battalion;

027:002 and going on board a ship of Adramyttium which was about
        to sail to the ports of the province of Asia, we put
        to sea; Aristarchus, the Macedonian, from Thessalonica,
        forming one of our party.

027:003 The next day we put in at Sidon.  There Julius treated Paul
        with thoughtful kindness and allowed him to visit his friends
        and profit by their generous care.

027:004 Putting to sea again, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus,
        because the winds were against us;

027:005 and, sailing the whole length of the sea that lies off Cilicia
        and Pamphylia, we reached Myra in Lycia.

027:006 There Julius found an Alexandrian ship bound for Italy,
        and put us on board of her.

027:007 It took several days of slow sailing for us to come with
        difficulty off Cnidus; from which point, as the wind did not
        allow us to get on in the direct course, we ran under the lee
        of Crete by Salmone.

027:008 Then, coasting along with difficulty, we reached a place called
        `Fair Havens,' near the town of Lasea.

027:009 Our voyage thus far had occupied a considerable time, and the
        navigation being now unsafe and the Fast also already over,
        Paul warned them.

027:010 "Sirs," he said, "I perceive that before long the voyage will
        be attended with danger and heavy loss, not only to the cargo
        and the ship but to our own lives also."

027:011 But Julius let himself be persuaded by the pilot and by the owner
        rather than by Paul's arguments;

027:012 and as the harbour was inconvenient for wintering in,
        the majority were in favour of putting out to sea, to try
        whether they could get to Phoenix--a harbour on the coast
        of Crete facing north-east and south-east--to winter there.

027:013 And a light breeze from the south sprang up, so that
        they supposed they were now sure of their purpose.
        So weighing anchor they ran along the coast of Crete,
        hugging the shore.

027:014 But it was not long before a furious north-east wind,
        coming down from the mountains, burst upon us and carried
        the ship out of her course.

027:015 She was unable to make headway against the gale; so we gave
        up and let her drive.

027:016 Then we ran under the lee of a little island called Cauda,
        where we managed with great difficulty to secure the boat;

027:017 and, after hoisting it on board, they used frapping-cables
        to undergird the ship, and, as they were afraid of being driven
        on the Syrtis quicksands, they lowered the gear and lay to.

027:018 But, as the storm was still violent, the next day they began
        to lighten the ship;

027:019 and, on the third day, with their own hands they threw the ship's
        spare gear overboard.

027:020 Then, when for several days neither sun nor stars were seen
        and the terrific gale still harassed us, the last ray of hope
        was now vanishing.

027:021 When for a long time they had taken but little food,
        Paul, standing up among them, said, "Sirs, you ought
        to have listened to me and not have sailed from Crete.
        You would then have escaped this suffering and loss.

027:022 But now take courage, for there will be no destruction of life
        among you, but of the ship only.

027:023 For there stood by my side, last night, an angel of the God
        to whom I belong, and whom also I worship,

027:024 and he said, "`Dismiss all fear, Paul, for you must stand
        before Caesar; and God has granted you the lives of all who
        are sailing with you.'

027:025 "Therefore, Sirs, take courage; for I believe God, and am
        convinced that things will happen exactly as I have been told.

027:026 But we are to be stranded on a certain island."

027:027 It was now the fourteenth night, and we were drifting through
        the Sea of Adria, when, about midnight, the sailors suspected
        that land was close at hand.

027:028 So they hove the lead and found twenty fathoms of water;
        and after a short time they hove again and found fifteen fathoms.

027:029 Then for fear of possibly running on rocks, they threw out four
        anchors from the stern and waited impatiently for daylight.

027:030 The sailors, however, wanted to make their escape from the ship,
        and had lowered the boat into the sea, pretending that they
        were going to lay out anchors from the bow.

027:031 But Paul, addressing Julius and the soldiers, said, "Your lives
        will be sacrificed, unless these men remain on board."

027:032 Then the soldiers cut the ropes of the ship's boat and let
        her fall off.

027:033 And continually, up till daybreak, Paul kept urging all on board
        to take some food.  "This is the fourteenth day," he said,
        "that you have been anxiously waiting for the storm to cease,
        and have fasted, eating little or nothing.

027:034 I therefore strongly advise you to take some food.
        This is essential for your safety.  For not a hair will perish
        from the head of any one of you."

027:035 Having said this he took some bread, and, after giving thanks
        to God for it before them all, he broke it in pieces and began
        to eat it.

027:036 This raised the spirits of all, and they too took food.

027:037 There were 276 of us, crew and passengers, all told.

027:038 After eating a hearty meal they lightened the ship by throwing
        the wheat overboard.

027:039 When daylight came, they tried in vain to recognise the coast.
        But an inlet with a sandy beach attracted their attention,
        and now their object was, if possible, to run the ship aground
        in this inlet.

027:040 So they cut away the anchors and left them in the sea,
        unloosing at the same time the bands which secured
        the paddle-rudders. Then, hoisting the foresail to the wind,
        they made for the beach.

027:041 But coming to a place where two seas met, they stranded the ship,
        and her bow sticking fast remained immovable, while the stern
        began to go to pieces under the heavy hammering of the sea.

027:042 Now the soldiers recommended that the prisoners should be killed,
        for fear some one of them might swim ashore and effect his escape.

027:043 But their Captain, bent on securing Paul's safety, kept them
        from their purpose and gave orders that those who could swim
        should first jump overboard and get to land;

027:044 and that the rest should follow, some on planks, and others
        on various things from the ship.  In this way they all got
        safely to land.

028:001 Our lives having been thus preserved, we discovered that
        the island was called Malta.

028:002 The strange-speaking natives showed us remarkable kindness,
        for they lighted a fire and made us all welcome because of
        the pelting rain and the cold.

028:003 Now, when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and had thrown
        them on the fire, a viper, driven by the heat, came out and
        fastened itself on his hand.

028:004 When the natives saw the creature hanging to his hand, they said
        to one another, "Beyond doubt this man is a murderer, for,
        though saved from the sea, unerring Justice does not permit
        him to live."

028:005 He, however, shook the reptile off into the fire and was unhurt.

028:006 They expected him soon to swell with inflammation or suddenly
        fall down dead; but, after waiting a long time and seeing
        no harm come to him, they changed their minds and said
        that he was a god.

028:007 Now in the same part of the island there were estates
        belonging to the Governor, whose name was Publius.
        He welcomed us to his house, and for three days generously
        made us his guests.

028:008 It happened, however, that his father was lying ill of dysentery
        aggravated by attacks of fever; so Paul went to see him, and,
        after praying, laid his hands on him and cured him.

028:009 After this, all the other sick people in the island came
        and were cured.

028:010 They also loaded us with honours, and when at last we sailed
        they put supplies on board for us.

028:011 Three months passed before we set sail in an Alexandrian vessel,
        called the `Twin Brothers,' which had wintered at the island.

028:012 At Syracuse we put in and stayed for two days.

028:013 From there we came round and reached Rhegium; and a day later,
        a south wind sprang up which brought us by the evening
        of the next day to Puteoli.

028:014 Here we found brethren, who invited us to remain with them
        for a week; and so we reached Rome.

028:015 Meanwhile the brethren there, hearing of our movements,
        came as far as the Market of Appius and the Three Huts to meet us;
        and when Paul saw them he thanked God and felt encouraged.

028:016 Upon our arrival in Rome, Paul received permission to live
        by himself, guarded by a soldier.

028:017 After one complete day he invited the leading men among the Jews
        to meet him; and, when they were come together, he said to them,
        "As for me, brethren, although I had done nothing prejudicial
        to our people or contrary to the customs of our forefathers,
        I was handed over as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the power
        of the Romans.

028:018 They, after they had sharply questioned me, were willing to set
        me at liberty, because they found no offence in me for which I
        deserve to die.

028:019 But, at last, the opposition of the Jews compelled me to appeal
        to Caesar; not however that I had any charge to bring
        against my nation.

028:020 For these reasons, then, I have invited you here, that I
        might see you and speak to you; for it is for the sake of Him
        who is the hope of Israel that this chain hangs upon me."

028:021 "For our part," they replied, "we have not received any letters
        from Judaea about you, nor have any of our countrymen come
        here and reported or stated anything to your disadvantage.

028:022 But we should be glad to hear from you what it is that
        you believe; for as for this sect all we know is that it
        is everywhere spoken against."

028:023 So they arranged a day with him and came to him in considerable
        numbers at the house of the friends who were entertaining him.
        And then, with solemn earnestness, he explained to them
        the subject of the Kingdom of God, endeavouring from morning
        till evening to convince them about Jesus, both from the Law
        of Moses and from the Prophets.

028:024 Some were convinced; others refused to believe.

028:025 Unable to agree among themselves, they at last left him,
        but not before Paul had spoken a parting word to them, saying,
        "Right well did the Holy Spirit say to your forefathers
        through the Prophet Isaiah:

028:026 "`Go to this people and tell them, you will hear and hear,
        and by no means understand; and will look and look,
        and by no means see.

028:027 For this people's mind has grown callous, their hearing has
        become dull, and their eyes they have closed; to prevent
        their ever seeing with their eyes, or hearing with their ears,
        or understanding with their minds, and turning back,
        so that I might cure them.'

028:028 "Be fully assured, therefore, that this salvation--God's salvation--
        has now been sent to the Gentiles, and that they, at any rate,
        will give heed."

028:029 []

028:030 After this Paul lived for fully two years in a hired house
        of his own, receiving all who came to see him.

028:031 He announced the coming of the Kingdom of God, and taught
        concerning the Lord Jesus Christ without let or hindrance.

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
