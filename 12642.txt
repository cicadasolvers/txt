ADDRESS

Encouraged by the kind welcome which greeted their former efforts to
provide a volume worthy the attention of the ladies of the United
Kingdom, the Publishers of the _Lady's Album of Fancy-Work_ have issued
a similar production for 1850. Solicitous to preserve the favourable
consideration so flatteringly accorded, every care has been taken to
render the _Lady's Album of fancy-Work_ for 1850 as attractive and
useful as possible; no expense has been spared in its artistic
illustration, letterpress, and embellishment; and it will be found an
elegant ornament in the drawing-room as well as a useful ally at the
work-table. The patterns and designs are of the most useful and varied
character: specimens are given of each style of work recently invented;
and no article either of ornament or use at present in fashion is
omitted.

The exercise of the needle has been from time immemorial a favourite
occupation with the females of every country; and the allusions to the
subject from cotemporary historians and poets evince that this feminine
pursuit was regarded with approval and respect. The invention of
embroidery is ascribed to the Phrygians; and we also learn from ancient
authors, that the Sidonians particularly excelled in this beautiful art
of decorative needlework; it must have also made considerable progress
in the country soon after the Norman Conquest, from the accounts that
are recorded of the robes embroidered in gold and silver, generally worn
by persons of rank at that period. The Bayeux Tapestry also remains to
us as a lasting trophy of the skill and industry of Queen Matilda and
the ladies of her court, and is not more interesting as a historical
record than as a specimen of the needlework of the mediaeval age. The
introduction of knitting into this country is comparatively of modern
date; so late as the middle of the sixteenth century. The invention of
the art is usually ascribed to the Spaniards; though the Scotch, with
some appearance of justice, assert their claims as its originators. Like
all inventions, knitting has undergone wonderful improvements since it
was first simply used for stocking-making: and the value attached to
stockings so made may be judged from the fact, that a pair were deemed a
fitting present from one sovereign to another. A pair of knitted hose
was amongst the gifts received by that lover of finery, Queen Elizabeth;
but no record remains to shew if these were preserved with the three
thousand robes which were found after her death in the wardrobe of
England's Maiden Queen.

The love for domestic occupations, which is so admirable a trait in the
character of our countrywomen, has often been a subject of gratulation;
and that female ingenuity and skill may continue to be employed in
embellishing the drawing-room, rather than in directing the political
intrigues of the _salon_, must be desired by all interested in the
preservation of those domestic attributes which give so pleasing a charm
to home, and secure the comfort of all around.

The taste which her Majesty Queen Victoria evinces for feminine pursuits
and occupations has naturally exercised considerable influence in
preserving habits of industry amongst her female subjects; and to her
Majesty's example, and that of the amiable Queen Dowager, may be
ascribed that the labours of the English embroideress are now justly
appreciated, and her work esteemed as in no respects inferior to the
produce of foreign ingenuity.

In expressing their thanks for the patronage extended to the _Lady's
Album of Fancy-Work_ for 1849, the Publishers take leave to state that
the present Volume contains designs and patterns for various articles in
Embroidery, Braid-Work, Crochet, Knitting, Netting, Ribbon-Work,
Scagliola, and Indian Ornamental Work; all of which are executed and
engraved in a style of unusual superiority. Each pattern is accompanied
with plain and explicit directions; and it is hoped that their execution
will afford many hours of pleasurable employment to the fair and
industrious votaress of the needle.

EXPLANATION OF THE VARIOUS TERMS USED IN CROCHET.


CHAIN-STITCH OPEN CROCHET.--This consists of five or any uneven number
of loops attached by a plain stitch to every third stitch of the
foundation, and in the succeeding rows to the centre loop of the chain
of previous row.

THREE CHAIN CROCHET.--Work a chain of three loops as in chain-stitch
open crochet.

DOUBLE CROCHET.--Work as follows: having made a chain, pass the needle
through the first loop on the chain, draw the cotton through the loop,
there will now be two loops on the needle, through these draw the
cotton.

SINGLE CROCHET.--Insert the needle in the loops, and draw the cotton
through this loop and that on the needle.

RIBBED CROCHET.--This is worked in a similar manner to double crochet,
only that the under loop of the previous row is taken, and it is done in
rows to and fro.

LONG STITCH.--Twist the cotton round the needle, pass it through the
loop, draw the cotton through the first two loops on the needle, then
catch the cotton again and draw it through the next two loops; there
will be one loop left on the needle.

DOUBLE LONG STITCH.--This resembles long stitch, excepting that the
cotton is twisted twice round the needle.

TREBLE LONG STITCH.--Twist the cotton three times round the needle.

SINGLE OPEN CROCHET.--This is a succession of long stitches, with a
chain-stitch between each, missing one stitch of the foundation; in the
succeeding rows the long stitch is worked between the two long stitches
of the preceding rows.

DOUBLE OPEN CROCHET.--This consists of two long stitches, then two
chain-stitches; or it may be varied by making one long stitch, two
chain-stitches, missing the same number of stitches in foundation as
there are chain-stitches.

TREBLE OPEN CROCHET.--Work three long stitches, then three chain,
missing three of the foundation.

VANDYKE OPEN CROCHET.--Work three long stitches into one of the
foundation, make one chain-stitch, miss three of the foundation; repeat.
In the next and following rows the long stitches are worked in the
chain-stitch.

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR EMBROIDERY.

The various elegant designs for handkerchiefs, jupons, shirts, &c. are
worked in raised satin stitch. The material used is French
working-cotton; numbers 100 or 120 will be found suitable for most
purposes, but this must be regulated by the quality of the cambric.
Handkerchiefs embroidered in colours continue to be extremely
fashionable; the patterns in the _Lady's Album_ are of the most novel
description, and quite suitable for this style of work. The names and
initial letters are worked in satin-stitch, sewing over the lines.

1. FRONT FOR LADY'S CABINET.

_Materials--Black satin; six shades of crimson, five shades of yellow,
three shades of puce, two shades of scarlet, three shades of
yellow-greens, three shades of blue-greens, and two shades of brown
embroidery silk, or of chenille_.


Draw the design upon the satin, frame the work, and work in
embroidery-stitch. The rose-leaves with the yellow-greens, the leaves of
thistles with the blue-greens, the stems with brown, the thistle and bud
of thistle with the shades of puce, working the centre of the former
with the shades of scarlet.

Work the rose on the right hand of thistle with the four darkest shades
of crimson, and that on the left and the buds with the four lightest
shades. Work the remaining rose with the yellow shades. Work the designs
for corners in a similar manner, shading according to the taste of the
worker.

The above design is adapted for the front or door of a small rosewood or
an inlaid ebony cabinet, suitable for a lady's boudoir or dressing-room.
It looks well if worked upon white instead of black satin; and if the
former is used, it is advisable to have plate-glass as a protection to
the needlework.

for the edge with wadding, trim with a small plume of blue feathers, or
a rosette of blue ribbon.

The above directions are for a bonnet for an infant of five or six
months old, but by increasing the number of rounds and rows for the roll
a larger size may be worked.

CROCHET

29. RAISED CROCHET COLLAR.

_Materials--Raworth's crochet-thread No. 70, and a middle-sized
tambour-needle_.


Cut out in paper the shape of the collar you wish to make, but half an
inch larger all round.

_Edging for the Collar_.--Make a chain about one-third longer than the
outside of your paper pattern, turn and work the first row along the
chain in long crochet, making a chain stitch after each long one, and
missing the corresponding loop of the chain.--

_2d row_. Turn again, keeping the work on the right side; make 3 chain
stitches, and along the opposite edge of the long stitches, (_a_), work
10 plain stitches, and in the tenth a chain of 9 stitches; turn, and
along the vein just made work 8 stitches in double crochet, and 1 plain
stitch in the loop from which the chain springs; repeat from (_a_)
throughout the row. Break off your cotton, and begin the next row and
all the following at the other end.--

_3d row. (b_) Work 9 plain stitches, then work round the vein in long
stitches, making an additional stitch at the top; repeat from (_b_).--

_4th row. (c_) Work 8 plain stitches, then round the leaf in long
stitches, making 2 additional stitches in the top loop; repeat from
(_c_).--

_5th row. (d_) Work 7 plain stitches, then, in double crochet, making
round the leaf an additional stitch in the top loop; repeat from
_(d)_.--

_6th row. (e)_ Work 6 plain stitches, and round the leaf in double
crochet, without making a stitch at the top; repeat from _(e)_.

To complete your edging, work a row of double crochet on the other edge
of the row of long stitches.

_Flowers for the Collar_.--

Make a chain of 6 stitches; close it by
taking a plain stitch in the first of the chain; work in every loop of
this small ring 2 long stitches, with a chain-stitch between each of the
long ones. In finishing the round, make a stitch to complete the number
of twenty-five loops; then _(a)_ work 5 plain stitches, and in the fifth
make a chain of 7 stitches; turn, work 6 stitches in double crochet
along the chain, and 1 plain in the loop from which the chain springs;
repeat from _(a)_ four times. You have then three veins; work round them
as directed for the leaves of the edging; after the second row of double
crochet break off your cotton. According to the size of the collar, five
or six flowers will be sufficient, if you make also the trifoliums.

_Trifoliums_.--Make a chain of 18 stitches; turn, and work along the
chain 3 plain stitches, a vein of 7 stitches; 6 plain, a vein of 8
stitches; 6 more plain stitches, another vein of 7; 3 plain stitches,
and break off the cotton. Begin at the first end, and work the two rows
of long stitches exactly as directed for the leaves of the edging; at
the end of the two following rows, which are in double crochet, round
the leaves, instead of breaking off the cotton, work in double crochet
from the third leaflet to the first; thus connecting the work in one
single leaf with three divisions. Having prepared the required number of
flowers and leaves, baste your edging on the paper pattern, so that the
whole of the leaves rest on the paper; then work a chain rather loose,
to connect the two ends of the collar on the neck side; turn, and work
along that chain a row of double crochet. Baste this narrow band
carefully half an inch from the edge of the paper; then begin a row of
double crochet inside the collar, throwing, at even distances, a
slanting chain from the edging to the neckband, working back each time
along that chain in long or double crochet; repeat the same operation
from the neckband to the edging, so as to divide the whole middle of the
collar in a certain number of diamonds; baste the diamonds to the paper,
place alternately in each a flower or a trifolium, and, with a
sewing-needle and fine French embroidery cotton, connect the flowers and
leaves to the inside edges of the diamonds in long twisted stitches,
rows of button-hole stitches, or any kind of lace-work. After being
washed and starched, the collar ought to be pressed on the wrong side
with the head of a round nail warmed in the fire.

This description of drawing is called Scagliola work, or a Mischia
(mixed workmanship); it was first invented by Guido Tassi, and the art
was afterwards improved and perfected by Henry Hugford, a monk, of
Vallambrosa. It was first used to counterfeit marbles; and the altar of
St. Antonio, in the church of St. Nicolo, at Carpi, is still preserved
as a monument of extraordinary skill and beauty. It consists of two
columns, representing porphyry, and adorned with a pallium, embroidered
as it were with lace; while it is ornamented in the margin with medals
bearing beautiful figures.

The dicromi, or yellow figures on a black ground, in imitation of the
Etruscan vases, are now most admired in scagliola work; and as the art
is one easy of attainment, we shall describe it. Having procured a piece
of sycamore of the desired size and shape, you draw upon it with a
pencil, first the centre piece, and afterwards the border; you then
trace over the pencil marks with Indian-ink and a fine crow-quill, and
next fill in the ground with Indian-ink and a camel's-hair brush. After
two or three days, varnish with the best picture-varnish. If sycamore
cannot be procured, deal will answer the purpose, covered with good
cream-coloured drawing-paper.

EMBROIDERY

32. GREEK CAP.

_Materials required will be a quarter of a yard of common bed-ticken,
but of a good broad stripe; some fine gold thread, also some silver
thread, and various coloured silks_.


Measure the size round the head, and cut a piece of ticken to the
length, and of the depth of seven inches; work on the _black_ stripes in
herring-bone; stitch a row of gold and silver cord, alternate; and on
the intermediate _white_ stripes work, according to fancy, different
coloured silks, also in herring-bone stitch, only rather larger, to fill
up the stripe. Cut a piece of ticken round, and of about 2-1/2 inches in
diameter; work it in the same manner, and mount it on a circular piece
of card; full the headpiece round the small crown, line it with some
bright-coloured Persian, and trim it with a gilt band, and gilt tassel
to match.

This cap is so simple a work, that it hardly allows any one to suppose
it will look as pretty as it certainly does.

35. UNDER-SLEEVE.

_Material--Raworth's crochet-thread No_. 70.


_Band of insertion for the Wrist_.--19 c s, unite d c round this ring
eighteen times, which will cover about three-quarters of the ring. Turn
the work wrong side up. 6 c s, miss 2, s c into third stitch; repeat
this five times more. Turn 1 d c, 5 l s, 1 d c, into every space formed
by 6 c s, d c round the remaining part of the ring six times; fasten
off, leaving one end about three inches long. Turn on the wrong side.
Begin on the third stitch of third scallop of last flower. 12 c s, s c
into fifth stitch of next scallop, forming a loop over the two centre
scallops. Turn. D c round this loop eighteen times. Turn. * 6 c s, miss
2, s c into third stitch; repeat from * five times more. Turn. 1 d c, 5
l s, 1 d c into every space formed by 6 c s; fasten off, leaving one end
as in last flower. Work fifteen of these flowers, thread a fine needle
with the ends left, and make a few stitches on the wrong side to secure
them. The band between the two puffings is to be worked exactly the
same; but there must be eighteen flowers instead of fifteen. Commence
the fulness on the band for the wrist on the first scallop, at the edge,
5 c s (working in the end of the thread), s c into the centre of next
scallop, * 6 c s, s c into the first scallop of next flower. 5 c s, s c
into next scallop; repeat from * to the end of the band.

_2d row_. Commence on the first loop of 5 c s in last row, * 8 c s, d c
round the next loop, 8 c s, d c round the same loop; repeat from * to
the end of the row.--_3d row_. Commence on first loop of 8 c s in last
row, 9 c s, d c into next loop, 9 c s, d c into next loop; repeat to the
end of the row.--_4th row_. Commence on the same loop of 8 c s, as the
last row was begun on 10 c s, d c round the centre of first loop in last
row, * 9 c s, d c round the next loop; repeat from * to the end of the
row. After the d c stitch round the last loop in this row, make 5 c s,
and draw the end of the cotton through. _These 5 c s must be worked at
the end of every alternate row, in order to keep the ends of the fulness
even_. Work four more rows like the two last, making in all six rows,
then seven rows, having 10 c s in each loop, every alternate row of
which is begun in the same loop as the preceding row, having 12 c s in
the first loop. Then work six more rows like the former six, having 9 c
s in each loop. This will make nineteen rows of loops: fasten off. Work
a fulness on the upper band of insertion in exactly the same manner, and
gather it in at the top next the sleeve in this way: commence on the
first loop 2 c s, take the next loop on the needle, and d c round it
once, 2 c s, * d c round next loop once, 2 c s; repeat from * to end of
row. In the next row, work 1 l s into every stitch of last row.

To unite the fulness on the wristband to the upper band of insertion,
turn them both on the wrong side, and hold them as if they were to be
sewn together, the insertion being at the back. Take the first loop, and
the centre stitch of the first scallop, on the needle, and work 1 s c to
unite them, 3 c s, s c the next loop and centre stitch of the next
scallop, o 4 c s, s c the next loop and centre of first scallop in next
flounce together, 3 c s, s c next loop and next scallop, o * 4 c s, s c
next loop and next scallop, 2 c s; take the next loop on the needle
_without_ the scallop, and s c once round it, 2 c s, s c the next loop
and next scallop together; repeat from * to end of row, except on the
two last flowers, which must be worked as from o to o.

_For the Edging on the Wristband_.--Commence on the first scallop of the
insertion, * 5 c s, s c into next scallop, 6 c s, s c into next scallop;
repeat from * to end of row.

_2d row_. 10 c s, 1 l s, into first loop of last row, * 3 c s, 1 l s
into same loop, 3 c s, 1 l s into next loop; repeat from * to end of
row.--

_3d row_. 7 c s, d c round every loop of last row.--

_4th row_. 4 c s, 1 l s into every loop of last row.--

_5th row_. Begin on the first loop of third row, 6 c s, 5 l s into first
loop of last row, 4 c s, d c into next loop, * 4 c s, 5 l s into next
loop, 4 c s, d c into next loop; repeat from *.--

_6th row_. 4 d c stitches round first loop of 6 c s in last row, 8 c s,
* miss the 5 l s, d c four times round the next loop of 4 c s, 4 d c
round the next loop, 8 c s; repeat from *.--

_7th row_. Begin on first loop of 8 in last row, 7 c s, s c _between_
the two loops of 4 d c each, * 7 c s, s c round the centre of 8 c s in
last row, 10 c s, d c round the same loop, 7 c s, s c between the two
loops of 4 d c; repeat from * to end of row. This finishes the edging.

D c round the ends of the puffings, taking in the ends left on finishing
the rows. Make a chain of 15 stitches at the ends of the two bands of
insertions, and s c into the edge for a small loop. D c round these
twenty-four times, and sew a small pearl button on the other ends of the
bands. The insertion may have a narrow satin ribbon run through the open
holes, finished by a small bow at the upper part of the sleeve.

3 long, 1 plain, 5 long to turn the point; 1 plain, 3 long, 1 plain
twice; 7 plain in stem. Fasten off. The second flower, worked as the
first, is united to it by working the eighth plain stitch of the last
round of the flowers into a stitch the same distance from the stem of
the first flower. To turn the corners of the collar, work a flower
without a leaf. Continue these flowers the length of the collar.

_Leaves and Flowers for the Centre_:--

_First leaf_. 31 chain. Turn. Insert the needle into the nineteenth
chain; 1 plain, 1 chain to cross the stem; 3 long into three following
chain; 2 long in 1 chain, 4 long, 2 long in 1 chain; 3 long to turn the
points. Then down the other side of the leaf the same. 4 plain in the
stem; 1 chain to cross the stem.--

_1st row_. Plain.--

_2d row_. 1 plain, 2 long, 3 double long, 2 long, 1 plain; repeat.
_Directions for making up the collar_.--After the leaves, flowers,
band, and border are worked, cut the shape of the collar in pink or blue
paper; gum a piece of holland at the back of the paper, to prevent its
tearing; tack the border on the paper pattern, the right side downwards;
then sew on the sprigs as in the engraving. Sew the edges of the leaves
and flowers nicely, to prevent their turning up; then, with a
sewing-needle and fine cotton, unite the flowers, leaves, and borders,
by passing the needle from one part of a leaf or flower to another four
or five times; then pass the needle under the bars formed six or eight
times, according to the length of the bar; pass the needle to another
part, and continue to connect the work in this manner throughout the
collar.

_Materials--Scarlet floss silk, or five shades of scarlet Berlin wool;
meshes Nos. 3 and 6; cornucopia gauge, and a flat mesh, an inch in
width_.


The cap is worked in honeycomb netting, and the borders and rosette in
plain netting. With the darkest shade make a foundation of 56 stitches
on mesh No. 3, net 2 rows with each shade, increasing a stitch at the
end of each row; leave one-half of the cap plain, and net a border in
the following manner on the remaining loops and at the ends:--With the
darkest shade net 4 loops in every loop on the flat mesh, increasing by
making 6 loops in each of the three corner stitches; then on mesh No. 3,
net 1 loop in each, and finish by netting a row with the next shade on
the smallest mesh: this must be repeated at each side of the cap. For
the second border, net 100 loops on the flat mesh on a foundation of
wool, and finish to correspond with the first border. Two pieces netted
in this manner are required, and they are arranged in festoons at the
sides of the cap. Pass a cord the size required through the
foundation-stitches, join it, and sew on a rosette made in the following
manner:--With the darkest shade net 100 loops on mesh No. 3; then with
the next shade net 2 rows at each side and at the ends; make this into a
rosette with long ends, as in illustration.

This elegant and becoming head-dress derives its name from the beautiful
sister-in-law of the Emperor of Russia, the Grand Duchess Helen, who
introduced this style of coiffure at St. Petersburg.

INDIAN ORNAMENTAL WORK

69. SCREEN.

Beautiful cabinets, work-boxes, work-tables, fire-screens, &c., may be
painted in imitation of ebony inlaid with ivory by the following
means:--Let your screen be made of an elegant form, but merely of common
white wood or deal, prepared as below.


_Composition for the Surface of Wood_.--Steep one ounce of glue in a
pint of cold water all night; throw off the water in the morning. Take
six ounces of finest white lead in powder, mix it by degrees in a
mortar, with about half a pint of cold water, till it is perfectly
smooth, then place it, along with the glue, in a clean pan. Add half a
pint more water; set it on the fire, stirring constantly till it boils.
Let it boil three minutes; take it off, and pour it into a stone jar,
and continue to stir it occasionally till cold. When cold, but before it
congeals, take a clean paint-brush, and paint your screen with the
composition. When it is quite dry, rub it over with sand-paper, to make
it quite smooth; then give it another coat of the white composition,
repeating the rubbing with sand-paper as before. Repeat this same
process five or six times, until you obtain a smooth, equal, white
surface. When that is accomplished, dissolve the fourth of an ounce of
isinglass in a quarter of a pint of water; when cold, but liquid, give
the screen a coat of it with a clean brush, and do not use the
sand-paper after it.

_To Ornament the Screen_.--Lay a sheet of black tracing-paper on the
screen, with the black side downwards; then place a pattern above it,
with the right side uppermost; place a weight here and there, to prevent
it slipping; then trace over the outline with a rather blunt stiletto.
On removing the paper, you will find the outline of the pattern
transferred to the surface of the screen. Trace over the outline,
and shade, in lines, with a fine camel's-hair pencil dipped in Newman's
lamp-black; fill in with the same.

_Varnish_.--Place four ounces of rectified spirit of wine in a
wide-mouthed bottle; add one ounce of gum sandarac, a quarter of an
ounce of gum mastic, and a drachm of camphor, all in powder. Put a
stopper in the bottle, set it near a fire, and shake it occasionally.
When all the gums are quite dissolved, add one ounce of oil of
turpentine; then strain through muslin into another clean, dry
wide-mouthed bottle. Let it stand a day or two before using.

_Mode of Varnishing_.--Take a large clean new varnish-brush, dip it into
the bottle, and then cover over all your screen with it. When perfectly
dry, give it another coat, and so on till it has had six coats; let it
remain untouched for two days; rub it smooth with sand-paper; then give
it two more coats of varnish, and repeat the rubbing, being careful to
wait between each coat till the last is dry, and not to rub with
sand-paper sooner than two days after varnishing, and never give more
than two coats of varnish in a day--one in the morning, another at
night. When you think it looks clear and sufficiently thick, give it
another coat without using the sand-paper after it; let it stand four
days; then rub it all over with pounded rottenstone, and wipe it off
with a wet cloth; after which take a little Florence oil and
hair-powder, and polish with your hand.

KNITTING

70. HEARTSEASE.

_Materials--Split Berlin wool, and knitting-needles No. 20; cornucopia
gauge_.


_Violet Petals_.--Cast on three stitches with a bright shade of violet;
knit and pearl in alternate rows, making a stitch at the beginning of
every row, until you have fourteen or sixteen stitches; then knit and
pearl six rows alternately, without increase, and continue in knitted
and pearled rows, decreasing one stitch at the beginning of each row,
till six or eight stitches alone remain; these cast off in the plain
row, taking the two last as one before you turn the last stitch over.
Two petals like these are required.

_Large Yellow Petal_.--Take a bright, though rather deep, shade of
yellow wool, split; cast on three stitches, knit and pearl in alternate
rows, increasing one stitch before and one after the middle stitch in
the plain row, till you have fifteen or seventeen stitches; take a
higher shade of yellow, and work six more alternate plain and pearled
rows, still increasing in the middle, but decreasing one stitch at the
beginning of every row; change your wool for a deep violet, and continue
to knit in alternate plain and pearled rows, decreasing one stitch at
the beginning of each row, till seven stitches only remain; these cast
off, taking the two last as one.

_Two smaller Petals_.--Exactly like the large one, but increased only to
thirteen stitches. Sew a fine wire round each petal with split wool, tie
the five petals together with a bit of green.

_Buds_.--Take eight or ten lengths of split wool, yellow and violet,
place across a piece of wire, fold the wire, twist the ends, turn down
the ends of wool, tie them round the wire, leaving out the length
required for the bud (about a quarter of an inch); cover the stem with
green wool, split; also the stem of the heartsease.

_Leaves_.--Begin with a shade of green wool, split as for one of the
yellow petals, but you have thirteen stitches; cast off three at the
beginning of the two following rows, go on increasing again to thirteen;
cast off three at each end, and make thus as many scallops as will look
well--in general three or four on each side make a very good-sized leaf;
after the last scallops, decrease one stitch at the beginning of every
row, till the leaf comes to a point.

RIBBON WORK

72. A NEW AND ELEGANT WORK FOR SOFA PILLOWS, ANTI-MACASSARS,
CARD-BASKETS, &c.

We will describe how to make an anti-macassar:--

_Take Penelope canvass, three quarters of a yard long, half a yard wide;
a piece of crimson china ribbon; one piece of gold-colour, one of shaded
lilac, and a rug-needle_.


Prepare the canvass by cutting away every 2 alternate threads, and draw
them out the whole length of the canvass; next cut away and draw them
out with tweezers, every 2 alternate threads, the whole of the width of
the canvass. Next thread the rug-needle with crimson ribbon, and sew
over the first 2 threads of canvass the lengthway of the canvass; when
at the end, pass the needle to the next 2 threads and sew them over,
taking care to keep the ribbon flat as possible; when at the top, return
and cover the next two threads with the same coloured ribbon. This will
make 3 stripes. Proceed the same with the gold-colour, 3 stripes; then
the lilac, 3 stripes; then recommence with the crimson, and continue the
same until you have the whole length finished. Next commence to sew over
the same from side to side, which will form a chequered pattern, and has
a rich effect. Finish round with a ruche of satin ribbon or fringe,
crimson colour. If desired, can be worked with slight silk.

73. LADY'S SILK MITTEN.

_Materials_--10 _pieces of fine black crochet silk_; 2 _bundles of No_.
6 _steel beads; Penelope crochet No_. 3.


Make a chain of 84 stitches; work 1 row in plain-stitch crochet.--

_2d row_. 2 edge-stitches, 1 bead-stitch, 1 plain to the end of row.--

_3d row_. Plain.--

_4th row_. Same as 2d row.--

_5th, 6th, and 7th rows_. Plain.--

_8th row_. 4 plain, 4 bead to the end of row.--

_9th, 10th, and 11th rows_. As 8th row.--

_13th, 14th, and 15th rows_. Plain.--

_16th row_. 1 plain-stitch, 1 bead-stitch to the end of row.--

_17th row_. Plain.

This completes the band for the arm, which must be worked on one side,
detaching the silk at the end of each row. Work 4 rows in chain-stitch
open crochet, making 7 loops in each chain, and missing 4 stitches in
working the first row, join and work in rounds; work _2_ rounds, then
divide the mit in half, and leave a space for the thumb; the silk must
be detached at the end of the row. Work to the centre of the back of
hand, make 3 chain-stitches, pass down a bead in making the next 3
chain-stitches, crochet to the centre stitch of chain of last row; then
work 3 stitches, passing down a bead at each stitch, then _3_
chain-stitches; work to the end of row. Work 6 rows, increasing the
number of bead-stitches by commencing at the preceding chain-stitch;
then work 6 rows, decreasing as seen in illustration; the last 3 of
these must be worked in rounds instead of rows; work _3_ rounds in
chain-stitches of 7 as before, then a round of chain-loops in each
chain. Work one-half plain for the inner part of the hand, then 1 bead,
1 plain. Next round plain. Work 3 rows thus on the back of the hand; 3
bead-stitches, 3 plain stitches. Next round plain; then 1 bead-stitch, 1
plain as before, and finish with a plain round. Now work the thumb as
follows:--Work a chain of 7, missing every third stitch; repeat three
times, then work 5 rounds, decreasing in each round by passing the loop
through the centre stitches of two of the chains; work 3 rounds without
decreasing, and finish with 3 rounds of close double crochet, making
every alternate stitch of the centre round a bead-stitch. Work a loop on
the band, and fasten with a button.

fourth shade of blue, fourth ditto of green, fourth ditto of peach
Berlin wool; amber floss silk, six skeins of each of the wools, and a
similar quantity of silk will be required; also a piece of fine
piping-cord, and emerald-green velvet ribbon_.


Cut the canvass into strips 3 inches in width, and the length required;
sew 14 lengths of cord upon the canvass, leaving 2 threads between each
cord; the cord will cover a space of 2 threads. Leave a margin 18
threads from this, and with black work 6 stitches over the 7th and 8th
cords opposite each other; with blue work 6 stitches on the same cords
on the right side, and with green 6 on the left; with peach work 6
stitches on the 9th and 10th cords, above the stitches of black; and
with scarlet 6 stitches on the 6th and 7th cords, underneath the black.
There will now be 60 stitches worked. With white work 6 stitches on a
line with each of the preceding stitches, and on the 2 cords above the
stitches of peach and below the scarlet; with amber silk work 6 stitches
in the same manner. This completes the first diamond. The pattern is
repeated to the end of row. The spaces between the diamonds are worked
as follows: With black work 6 stitches on a line with each stitch of
amber; with peach work the stitches between the black on the 3d and 4th
cords; on the right hand work 6 stitches with blue on the 1st and 2d
cords, and on the left with green; work the centre stitches with silk.
The opposite space is worked in a similar manner, substituting scarlet
for peach. For a cushion it will be necessary to work 4 strips of this
pattern; and, in making it up, a length of velvet ribbon of a similar
width is placed between each division of work. Finish with green cord
and tassels.

_Centre Flower_.--12 c s, unite, work into this ring 5 c s, 1 l s, * 2 c
s, 1 l s; repeat from * eleven times, finish with 2 c s, s c into third
stitch of first, 5 c s.--

_2d round_. D c into first space, * 5 c s, d c into next space; repeat
from * into every space, finish with 5 c s, s c into first d c of the
round.--

_3d round_. 5 d c round every loop of 5 c s in last round.

_The eight Leaves round this Flower_.--Commence on one of the stitches
at the edge of this flower, 25 c s, s c back (this is for the stripe in
the centre of leaf), * 5 c s, miss 3, d c into fourth; repeat from *
five times, which brings it to top stitch of leaf, 6 c s, d c into same
stitch, 5 c s, miss 3, d c into fourth six times down the other side of
the stripe, draw out the loop on the needle a little, pass the thread
under the leaf, 1 d c round the first loop, 5 c s, d c round the next
loop, * 6 c s, d c round the next; repeat from * four times, which
brings it to top loop, 7 c s into same top loop, 6 c s into five more
loops down the other side, 5 c s, d c into last loop, pass the thread
under the leaf, d c three times round the loop next to stripe, five
times round next loop, six times round every loop up to the top, 2 d c,
5 l s, 2 d c round the top loop, 6 d c round every chain of six down the
other side, 5 d c round chain of 5, 3 d c round the last loop at bottom
of leaf next to the stripe; fasten off. Make another leaf in the same
manner at the opposite side of the centre flower, and one at an equal
distance between these two; another on the other side to correspond,
which will make four leaves, then work four more leaves between these 4,
and the eight leaves will be finished.

_For the rounds of open work proceed thus:_ Commence on the point of one
of the leaves, work 29 c s, d c into point of next leaf; repeat this all
round, not making the c s too tight.--

_2d round_. D c into every stitch of this round.--

_3d round_. 1 l s, * 3 c s, miss 2, 1 l s into third stitch; repeat from
*.--

_4th round_. D c into every stitch of last round.--

_5th round_. 1 l s, * 3 c s, miss 2, 1 l s into third stitch; repeat
from *.--

_6th round_. D c into every stitch of last round.--

_7th round_. 1 l s, 2 c s, miss 2, 1 l s into third; repeat from * all
round.--

_8th round_. D c into every stitch of last round. Work on the inside of
the first round of 29 c s a ring, thus: commence on centre, c s
_between_ the leaves, 16 c s, unite on foundation-stitch, d c
twenty-four times round this ring; repeat these rings between every two
leaves, making eight in all.

_The Leaves on the outside of the open Rounds_.--

Commence on stitch
opposite to the point of one of the large leaves. 18 c s, 1 l s into
sixth stitch, * 2 c s, miss 2, 1 l s into third; repeat three times more
from *. 1 s c into foundation-stitch, then 4 d c round first loop; 1 d
c, 2 l s, 1 d c round next three loops, 1 d c, 4 l s, 1 d c round top
loop; 1 d c, 2 l s, 1 d c round three loops on the other side of leaf; 4
d c round last loop. Make another leaf in the same manner, beginning at
the same foundation-stitch. Fasten off. Then two more leaves exactly the
same, opposite the points of all the large centre leaves. Then two more
leaves opposite each of the d c rings inside the open rounds (which will
be at an equal distance on each side from the others). There will now be
thirty-two small leaves, two and two, the upper point of each leaf to be
turned _outwards_, and to be tacked with needle and thread to the point
of the next leaf, which it will meet easily. (Care must be taken to
refer to the engraving for the manner in which the mat is to be
finished, as it will greatly assist the explanations.)

For the small roses between the leaves, which are made separately: 9 c
s, unite, 5 c s, 1 long stitch into ring, * 2 c s, 1 l s; repeat from *
seven times. 2 c s, s c into third stitch of first 5 c s.

_2d round_. 1 s c round first space, 3 c s, 3 l s, into same space, * 5
c s, miss 1 space, 4 l s into next space; repeat from * all round.
Finish with 5 c s, s c into third stitch of 3 c s. Fasten off sixteen
roses for the round. Place one of these roses between every pair of the
leaves which proceed from the same foundation, and sew it at the edge to
the third scallop of the leaves; then commence between the points of the
leaves which were sewn together, * 24 c s, d c into centre of edge of
small rose, 24 c s, d c between the points of the leaves; repeat from *
all round, then 26 d c stitches _round_ every 24 chain.

_Sprigs between the 24 C S_.--18 c s, unite on twelfth. D c round this
loop twenty-two times. S c up remaining c s for stalk. Fasten off,
leaving an end to sew the sprig on the mat. Turn wrong side up. Commence
on fifth stitch from stalk on the _right-hand side_ of the flower, * 10
c s, unite in same stitch. Turn again. Into this circle work 18 d c
stitches *. Turn wrong side up. S c up to top of ring formed by 18 c s;
repeat from * to * for another ring. Turn wrong side. S c down to fifth
stitch from stalk. Repeat another ring, when the work will be on the
right side. Bring the cotton to the side of this last ring nearest to
stalk. 13 c s, s c into top of last ring. 6 c s, s c into same stitch.
13 c s, s c into foundation close to the lower part of ring. 5 c s, s c
into _foundation-ring,_ close to centre ring, at the top. 13 c s, s c
into top of ring; 6 c s, s c into same stitch; 13 c s, s c into
foundation at bottom of ring; 5 c s, s c into foundation at lower part
of next ring; 13 c s, s c into top of ring; 6 c s, s c into same stitch;
13 c s, s c into foundation at the other side of ring. Fasten off.
Sixteen of these sprigs are required, and sixteen more small roses.
Place one sprig between each of the chains of 24 d c, where they meet at
the points of the leaves, and sew them by the thread which was left at
the end of the stalk. Confine them to the 24 d c by the lower 13 c s.
Place a small rose between each of these sprigs, fastening them together
where they meet. The best way is, to cut out a circle in coloured paper,
and (after the crochet work is completed) place the mat wrong side up
upon it, and fasten the flowers to it and to each other, as it will then
be quite flat and smooth.

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
