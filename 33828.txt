PREFACE

The use of abbreviations and signs is often a convenience and sometimes a
temptation. It is a saving of time and labor which is entirely justifiable
under certain conditions, one of which is that all such short cuts should
be sufficiently conventional and familiar to be intelligible to any person
likely to read the printed matter in which they occur. Scientific and
technical signs and abbreviations are part of the nomenclature of the
subject to which they belong and must be learned by students of it. General
readers are not particularly concerned with them.

The use of abbreviations and signs is partly a matter of office style and
partly a matter of author's preference. Certain fairly well established
rules have, however, emerged from the varieties of usage in vogue. An
attempt has been made in the following pages to state these rules clearly
and concisely and to illustrate their application.

Classified lists of the most common abbreviations and signs have been
inserted and will be found useful for reference and practice. Sources of
further information on these points will be found under the head of
Supplementary Reading.

ABBREVIATIONS AND SIGNS

INTRODUCTION

The use of abbreviations is as old as the use of alphabets. In inscriptions
and on coins and in other places where room is limited they have always
been used in order to save space. The words GUILIELMUS QUARTUS DEI GRATIA
REX BRITANNIARUM FIDEI DEFENSOR would hardly go around the circumference of
a sixpence, three quarters of an inch in diameter. Therefore, we find them
written GUILIELMUS IIII D: G: BRITANNIAR: REX F: D: In the manuscript
period abbreviations were very extensively used. This was done partly to
lighten the great labor of hand copying and partly to effect a double
saving of expense, in labor and in costly material. Certain of these
abbreviations were in common use and perfectly intelligible. Unfortunately
the copyists did not limit their abbreviations to these, but devised others
for their own use much to the discomfort of their readers, especially after
the lapse of centuries.

The introduction of printing removed the pressing necessity for the
extensive use of abbreviations, but the actual use continued much longer
than one would think. The early printed books were reproductions of
manuscripts. In some cases the earliest were almost forgeries, and were
probably intended to be sold as manuscripts. The types were cut in
imitation of the handwriting of some well-known scribe and all his
mannerisms and peculiarities were faithfully copied. An incidental result
was the expansion of fonts of type by the inclusion of a great number of
ligatures and of characters indicating the omission or combination of
letters. Habit dies hard, and even after the type founders had freed
themselves from the tyranny of manuscript printers continued to follow the
habits of the copyist. The saving of material and labor still continued to
be considered. The {2} methods of abbreviation in use in written matter
continued to be followed in print even down to the first quarter of the
last century.

The result of all this abbreviation was serious and well-founded complaint
about the difficulty of reading books thus printed. De Vinne gives the
following astonishing example, said to be taken practically at random from
a Latin copy of the Logic of Ockham printed at Paris in 1488.

    "Sic his e fal sm qd ad simplr a e pducibile a Deo g a e silr hic a n e
    g a n e pducibile a Deo."

These are the abbreviations for Sicut his est fallacia secundum quid ad
simpliciter. A est producibile a Deo. Ergo A est. Et similiter hic. A non
est. Ergo A non est producibile a Deo.

The best present usage is to use abbreviations very sparingly. Certain
recognized abbreviations are used under certain conditions, but generally
only under constraint of limited space.

RULES FOR THE USE OF ABBREVIATIONS

I. GENERAL RULES.

Use no contractions or abbreviations in any place where there is room to
print the words in full.

All legitimate words should be spelled out in full in text matter, but
abbreviations are often needed in book work for footnotes and tables and in
commercial work, where many brief forms and signs are used which are
commonly understood and are as intelligible as words.

Certain special forms of printing such as market and stock reports,
sporting news, price lists, directories, telephone directories, and the
like make extensive use of abbreviations and signs. These abbreviations are
of very limited use and often of only temporary life. They are not
intelligible to general readers and should never be used outside the
particular form of composition to which they pertain. De Vinne suggests
that in the absence of printed authority (many of these abbreviations not
appearing in the dictionary lists) every proofreader would do well to keep
a manuscript book of unlisted abbreviations which he has to use repeatedly
as a means of securing uniformity of form.

II. DATES.

Dates are not generally abbreviated in regular text matter; _The
Declaration of Independence was signed on July the fourth, 1776._ The word
_the_ is sometimes omitted. The date might be written _July fourth_ but
never _July four_.

The abbreviations _ult._ _inst._ and _prox._ with a numeral (meaning _the
25th of last month_, _the 25th of this month_, _the 25th of next month_)
are often used in letters, but should not be used in print unless the
literal reproduction of a letter is intended. {4}

Do not use _st_, _d_, _rd_, or _th_ after a date given in figures; _August
the sixth_, not _August 6th_.

The accepted abbreviations for the months are:

  _Jan._   _Apr._   _July_   _Oct._
  _Feb._   _May_    _Aug._   _Nov._
  _Mar._   _June_   _Sept._  _Dec._

The accepted abbreviations for the days of the week are:

  _Sun._   _Tues._  _Thurs._  _Sat._
  _Mon._   _Wed._   _Fri._

The accepted abbreviations may be used for the months when the day is
given, but not when the month and year alone are given;

  _Jan. 15, 1916_, but _January 1916_.

Some good authorities prefer the order day, month, year; _15 Jan., 1916_,
but this is a matter of office style. Generally speaking the more common
order is the better quite regardless of the logical character because it
requires less mental effort on the part of the reader. For example in
writing addresses English speaking people put the number before the street,
_59 Wall St._, while others put the number after the street, _Wall St.,
59_. This is the logical order, because one goes to the street and then
finds the number, but it gives to the American reader a curious sensation
of mentally standing on one's head.

There is another set of abbreviations, known as the Dewey dates, as
follows:

           Months                   Days of Week
  _Ja._  _Apr._ _Ju._  _O._       _Su._  _W._   _S._
  _F._   _My._  _Ag._  _N._       _M._   _Th._
  _Mr._  _Je._  _S._   _D._       _Tu._  _F._

These may be used in tables and in other places where very great
condensation is necessary, but not elsewhere.

In general, much greater abbreviation is permissible in the tables, notes,
and other condensed matter than in the body of the text. {5}

III. TIME.

Statements of time should not be abbreviated in ordinary reading matter;
_at half past two o'clock in the afternoon_. If the context makes it clear
whether forenoon or afternoon is meant one may write:

  _at three, at seven o' clock_.

This form is used statistically, in enumerations, in tables, and the like.

IV. OTHER ABBREVIATIONS INVOLVING THE USE OF NUMERALS.

The use of numerals and the spelling of numbers in full will be found
treated at length in the Printer's Manual of Style (No. 42). As the use of
the numeral is in a sense an abbreviation a few general rules may properly
be given here.

    1. Spell out ages;

      _eighty-two years and four months old_.
      _in his eighty-third year_.
      _children between the ages of six and fourteen_.

    2. Spell out references to decades;

      _in the early eighties_.

    The form _in the '80s_, is very objectionable.

    3. Spell out numbers of centuries, of sessions of Congress, of military
    bodies, of political divisions, of Egyptian Dynasties, of streets, and
    the like unless lack of space renders the abbreviation absolutely
    necessary.

      _Twentieth century_.
      _Forty-second Congress_.
      _One hundred and first Pennsylvania Infantry_.
      _Eighteenth Dynasty_.
      _Ninth Ward_.
      _Fifth Avenue_.

    In case numerals are used, Egyptian Dynasties are always designated by
    Roman numerals. Writers on Egypt usually use this form:

      XVIII_th Dynasty_.

    {6}

    4. Spell out sums of money when occurring in ordinary reading matter in
    isolated cases:

      _That press cost five thousand dollars._

    When several such numbers occur close together, and in all statistical
    matter, use figures.

      _Those three presses cost $2,500, $3,600, and $5,000._

    5. Spell out round numbers, that is, approximate numbers in units of
    100 in numbers of less than 1000 and in units of 1000 if the numbers
    are more.

      _An army corps numbers forty thousand men._
      _The Fifth Corps numbers 37,462._
      _There are about five hundred officers._

    Write _fifteen hundred_ and the like when the phrase is in common use,
    not _one thousand five hundred_.

    6. Spell out all numbers, no matter how high, when they begin a
    sentence.

      _Four thousand nine hundred and sixty-four soldiers, 109 officers,
          and 10,000 civilians were surrendered with the fort._

    7. Spell out in ordinary reading matter all numbers of less than three
    digits, unless they are of a statistical or technical character or
    occur in groups of six or more in close connection.

      _There are sixty cities in the United States with a population of
          100,000 or over._
      _a ninety-ton engine_.
      _five pounds of butter_.
      _He lived only two years, one month, and twenty days._
      _He spent 137 days in prison._
      _A ratio of 16 to 1_.
      _The death rate varies from 1 in 15 to 1 in 65._
      _Send home:_
        _2 pounds of butter_
        _1 pound of sugar_
        _1/2 pound of coffee_
        _1/4 pound of tea_
        _2 pecks of potatoes_
        _1 pound of salt pork_
        _2 pounds of lard_
        _1 quart of milk_

    {7}

    Treat all numbers in collected groups alike if possible, that is use
    either the long or the short form for all. If the largest contains
    three or more digits use figures for all.

      _They came in groups of 50, 80, 100, and even 200._

    8. Express in figures as a rule decimals, degrees, dimensions,
    distances, enumerations, money, (but see 4 above), percentage, weights,
    and the like.

      _.542, 98deg_, _9 cubic yards_, _37 miles_, _24 pages_, _$1000_,
      _6 per cent_ (_or 6% but never six %_), _175 pounds_.

V. GEOGRAPHICAL ABBREVIATIONS.

Geographical names are ordinarily not abbreviated in text matter. The
abbreviations in the subjoined lists are commonly recognized and may be
used in lists, bibliographical matter, and elsewhere where condensation is
desired.

    etc.

      _St. John Chrysostom_, _St. Paul_, _St. Botolph Street_,
      _The Church of SS_ (_Saints_) _Peter and Paul_.

    The word _Saint_ is now omitted in speaking of the evangelists, the

      _The Rand-McNalley Co._
      _Macmillan & Co._
      _Harper Bros._
      _New York, New Haven, & Hartford Railroad_.

    In text matter not of a technical character it is better not to
    abbreviate.

      _Harper Brothers have published._
      _It was printed by the Rand-McNalley Company._
      _The romantic history of the East India Company_.

    Do not use _ampersand_ except with names of persons.

      _John Brown & Co._
      _The Brown Printing and Publishing Co._

VII. TITLES.

    1. As a rule titles prefixed to a name should not be abbreviated except
    _Mr._, _Messrs._, _Mrs._ (French _M._, _MM._, _Mme._, _Mlle._), _Dr._,
    _Rev._, and _Hon._

    _Professor_, _Colonel_, _General_ and some others may be abbreviated
    when the initials of the name are used;

      _Professor Smith_      _Prof. J. T. Smith_
      _General Grant_        _Gen. U. S. Grant_

    _Hon._ and _Rev._, which are similarly used, need special attention as
    they are often used wrongly. The following is the correct use;

      _The Reverend John Smith_ (formal reference)
      _The Rev. John Smith_ (quotation or correspondence)
      _Rev. Mr. Smith_
      _Rev. John Smith_

    _Rev. Smith_ is wrong and should never be used except as any illiterate
    form may be used in a quotation. When the names of sovereigns are
    mentioned only occasionally such names may be given in full.

      _George the Fifth_, _William the Second_.

    When such names occur frequently, as in historical writing, they may be
    printed with Roman numerals without a period;

      _George V_, _William II_

    Other titles following a name are abbreviated in accordance with the
    following list.

VIII. SIZES OF BOOKS.

The shorter names for book sizes are usually written out;

  _folio_, _quarto_, _octavo_.

Beyond that they are usually abbreviated by using the Arabic numeral and
_mo_, but without a period;

  _12 mo_, _16 mo_, etc.

{19}

IX. WEIGHTS AND MEASURES.

Abbreviate the common designations of weights and measures in the metric
system, as well as other symbols of measurement in common use when
following a numeral;

    _1 m._, _5 dm._, _4 cm._, _2 mm._, _c.m._ (_cubic meter_), _c.d._,
    _min._ (_minute_), _sec._ (_second_), _lb._ (_pound_), _oz._ (_ounce_),
    _yd._, _ft._, _in._, _A._ (_Anglestrom units_), _H.P._ (_Horse power_),
    _C._ (_Centigrade_ [_Thermometer_]).

X. FOOTNOTES.

Authorities cited in footnotes should be specified in the following order:

    1. The best known name of the author. Give initials only when necessary
    to distinguish between several authors of the same name. Set in roman
    lower-case unless otherwise ordered.

    2. The name of the book in roman lower-case. If there is a
    Bibliography, or list of authorities attached to the book the names of
    all works referred to should there appear in full, but should be
    abbreviated in the notes. Otherwise, the name is sometimes written in
    full the first time it is referred to in a footnote and afterward
    abbreviated. If the book has but few references to authorities the
    names may be given in full in the footnotes especially when the
    reference is to the book as a whole and not to a particular paragraph.
    In such a case as this last the name is often printed in italics.

    Always abbreviate uniformly in the same book.

    3. The number of the volume in roman numerals of capital letters. No
    period.

    4. The numbers of the pages in Arabic figures. If there are several
    editions varying in subject matter and paging the edition used should
    be specified. If the edition has been specified in the Bibliography
    this information should not be repeated in the footnotes. {20} In books
    like the Bible, Shakespeare, Blackstone, or Milton, which have been
    printed in innumerable editions book, chapter and verse; act, scene and
    line; section and paragraph, or canto, stanza, and line must be
    specified.

The following excellently chosen illustrations of good methods in handling
numerous footnotes in learned works are taken from De Vinne's "Correct
Composition."

The comma is often omitted after the period in footnotes. The abbreviation
_ch_, _p_, and _pp_, may be made in notes, but not in text matter.

In lower-case text do not use _&c_, use _etc._

By-laws are often printed with side-headings _Art. 1_, _Sec. 2_, _etc._ It
is better to print the words, _article_ and _section_ in full in the
paragraph where they first appear and to omit the word in subsequent
paragraphs, using the proper figure only.

Figures used in illustrations to facilitate their understanding and
explained in small text below the illustration or in the text matter itself
do not have No. before them either in the illustration or in the
explanation. {22}

Figures and letters used as references to footnotes do not take a period.

Where two or more pages are specified in the text set them thus: _Pages 24,
25, 57_ not _pp. 24-5, 57_ nor _25-57_. When the reference is to several
pages continually set _pages 24 to 32_.

When a period of time is expressed by the dates of two or more consecutive
years, set thus: _1846-7_, _1861-5_, when there is a lapse of a year or
more, set thus: _1866-7-1869-70_. Do not abbreviate into _'66-'7-'69-'70_.

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS

There are many other signs and abbreviations used in works on the various
sciences. Approved modern text-books are the only safe guides to the proper
use of these.

In printing dialect, slang, and colloquialisms the only general rule is to
follow copy.

Such abbreviations as _I've_, _you'll_, _'t'was_, _'t'is n't_, and the like
are more clearly expressed when a thin space is put between the words.

Old Style contractions should follow the original even if special sorts
have to be obtained for the purpose.

Abbreviations like _dept_, _dep't_, _gov't_, _sec_, _sec'y_, _sect'y_,
_pres't_, and _treas._ are indefensible. Even in letter heads and the like
it is better to spell out the words in two lines.

SUPPLEMENTARY READING

    Correct Composition. By Theodore Low De Vinne. Oswald Publishing Co.,
    New York.

    The Writer's Desk Book. By William Dana Orcutt.

    The list of abbreviations and signs in many of the principal
    dictionaries may be studied with profit.

    Scientific text-books may be profitably used to study the abbreviations
    and signs used in mathematics and the sciences.

    required to write them out and set them up. The pupil should be
    required to explain by reference to the rules the use and the omission
    of abbreviations and the work should be criticised by the class or by
    the instructor with reference to the rules.

TYPOGRAPHIC TECHNICAL SERIES FOR APPRENTICES

The following list of publications, comprising the TYPOGRAPHIC TECHNICAL
SERIES FOR APPRENTICES, has been prepared under the supervision of the
Committee on Education of the United Typothetae of America for use in trade
classes, in course of printing instruction, and by individuals.

Each publication has been compiled by a competent author or group of
authors, and carefully edited, the purpose being to provide the printers of
the United States--employers, journeymen, and apprentices--with a
comprehensive series of handy and inexpensive compendiums of reliable,
up-to-date information upon the various branches and specialties of the
printing craft, all arranged in orderly fashion for progressive study.

The publications of the series are of uniform size, 5 x 8 inches. Their
general make-up, in typography, illustrations, etc., has been, as far as
practicable, kept in harmony throughout. A brief synopsis of the particular
contents and other chief features of each volume will be found under each
title in the following list.

Each topic is treated in a concise manner, the aim being to embody in each
publication as completely as possible all the rudimentary information and
essential facts necessary to an understanding of the subject. Care has been
taken to make all statements accurate and clear, with the purpose of
bringing essential information within the understanding of beginners in the
different fields of study. Wherever practicable, simple and well-defined
drawings and illustrations have been used to assist in giving additional
clearness to the text.

In order that the pamphlets may be of the greatest possible help for use in
trade-school classes and for self-instruction, each title is accompanied by
a list of Review Questions covering essential items of the subject matter.
A short Glossary of technical terms belonging to the subject or department
treated is also added to many of the books.

These are the Official Text-books of the United Typothetae of America.

ACKNOWLEDGMENT

This series of Typographic Text-books is the result of the splendid
co-operation of a large number of firms and individuals engaged in the
printing business and its allied industries in the United States of
America.

The Committee on Education of the United Typothetae of America, under whose
auspices the books have been prepared and published, acknowledges its
indebtedness for the generous assistance rendered by the many authors,
printers, and others identified with this work.

While due acknowledgment is made on the title and copyright pages of those
contributing to each book, the Committee nevertheless felt that a group
list of co-operating firms would be of interest.

The following list is not complete, as it includes only those who have
co-operated in the production of a portion of the volumes, constituting the
first printing. As soon as the entire list of books comprising the
Typographic Technical Series has been completed (which the Committee hopes
will be at an early date), the full list will be printed in each volume.

The Committee also desires to acknowledge its indebtedness to the many
subscribers to this Series who have patiently awaited its publication.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
