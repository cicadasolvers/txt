[Transcriber's Note:

This is an updated version of an e-text originally produced in November
2006; see end of text for additions and corrections.

The e-text consists of two separately published books:

  _Spellings for the Schools in the Chipeway Language_
  _Sketch of Grammar of the Chippeway Language_

In the first book (Spellings...), the hyphen - is used to separate
syllables. In the second book (Grammar...) the hyphen seems to
represent the glottal stop.

In the word lists of the first book, the first entry in each column was
sometimes-- but not consistently-- capitalized. This capitalization has
been retained, whether or not the e-text layout replicates the original.

A few punctuation marks in the paradigms and vocabulary lists have been
supplied or regularized. Other errors and anomalies are listed at the
end of the e-text. Bracketed text is in the original unless otherwise
noted.]

  Sketch of Grammar
  of the
  CHIPPEWAY LANGUAGE,

  To Which Is Added a Vocabulary
  of some of the most common Words.

ADVERTISEMENT.

The following pages were written as an exercise for my leisure hours,
while attending the Oneida Conference Seminary during the past winter.
As it is the first attempt that, to my knowledge, has ever been made to
reduce the Chippeway language to any system, it cannot be expected to be
otherwise than imperfect, and perhaps may hereafter be found to be, in
some respects, erroneous. It is, however, as free from errors as my
present means have enabled me to make it. It has been printed at the
request of my friends, by a fellow student, at his own suggestion and
expense.

J. SUMMERFIELD.

Cazenovia, April 10, 1834.




SKETCH OF GRAMMAR, &c.


The Letters used in the Chippeway Language, are twenty-one, viz.
A, a; B, b; C, c; D, d; E, e; G, g; H, h; I, i; J, j; K, k; M, m; N, n;
O, o; P, p; Q, q; S, s; T, t; U, u; W, w; Y, y; Z, z. F, L, R, V, and X,
are not used.

There are, in the Chippeway Language, ten parts of Speech, namely,
the _article_, the _noun_, the _pronoun_, the _adjective_, the _verb_,
the _participle_, the _adverb_, the _preposition_, the _conjunction_,
and the _interjection_.


OF THE ARTICLE.

There is but one Article, used definitely both in the masculine and
neuter genders, viz. Owh, the, m.; Ewh, the, n.


OF NOUNS.

A Noun is the name of any person, place, or thing; as, Eneneh, man;
Kahdahnahqueeng, Kingston; metig, tree.

Nouns are of two sorts, Common and Proper.

Common Nouns stand for kinds containing many sorts, or for sorts
containing many individuals under them; as, Ahwaseeh, animal; eneneh,
man; kegownh, fish; penaseh, bird.

Proper Nouns are the names appropriated to individuals, as, Charles,
Cazenovia, Ganges. [N.B. Proper names, with a few exceptions, are the
same as in English.]

To Nouns belong gender, person, number, and case.

GENDER.

Gender is the distinction of nouns with regard to sex.

Nouns have three genders, the masculine, the feminine, and the neuter.

The masculine gender denotes males; as, Eneneh, man.

The feminine gender is applied to animals, fishes, and birds; as,
Nahbak, a she bear, &c.

The neuter gender denotes things without sex; as, Wewahquon, a hat.

NUMBER.

Number is the distinction of objects as one or more.

Nouns are of two numbers, the singular and the plural.

The singular number implies but one object; as, Mahzenahegun, a book.

The plural number implies more than one; as, Mahzhenahegahnun, books.

CASE.

Nouns have three cases, the nominative, the possessive, and the
objective.

The nominative case simply expresses the name of a thing, &c.;
as, Owh quewesanceoobahkahmegezeh, the boy plays.

The possessive case expresses the relation of property or possession,
and always ends with the letter _o_; as, Noosayo wegewaum, my father's
house.

The objective case expresses the object of an action or of relation;
as John owejeahn Charles, John assists Charles.

Nouns may be declined in the following manner:

                   Singular.          Plural.
  _Nom. Case_,     Eneneh, man.       Enenewug, men.
  _Poss. Case_,    Eneneho, man's.    Enenewugo, men's.
  _Obj. Case_,     Eneneh, man.       Enenewug, men.


OF PRONOUNS.

A Pronoun is a word used instead of a noun, to avoid repeating the same
word; as, Pahpenatum eneneh, the man is happy; Pahpenatum, he is happy.

PERSONAL PRONOUNS.

There are three personal pronouns, viz. Neen, I; keen, thou; ween, he;
with their plurals, Nenahwind, we; kenahwah, ye or you; wenahwah, they.

Personal pronouns have person, number, gender and case.

The persons of pronouns are three in each number, viz.

  Neen, I, is the first person,        }
  Keen, thou, is the second person,    } Singular.
  Ween, he, is the third person,       }
  Nenahwind, we, is the first person,     }
  Kenahwah, you, is the second person,    } Plural.
  Wenahwah, they, is the third person,    }

_Number._--Pronouns have two numbers, the singular and the plural.

_Case._--Pronouns have three cases, the nominative, the possessive, and
the objective.

Pronouns cannot be declined. The cases of each person have the same
form.

  First person.  _Singular._    _Plural._
      _Nom._     Neen, I.       Nenahwind, we.
      _Poss._    Neen, mine.    Nenahwind, ours.
      _Obj._     Neen, me.      Nenahwind, us.


OF ADJECTIVES.

An Adjective is a word added to a noun to express its quality; as,
quahnoj eneneh, a good man; menwawezheh eneneh, an industrious man.

Adjectives are not varied to agree with their nouns, nor do they have
any regular comparison.

The following is a list of Numeral Adjectives:

OF VERBS.

A Verb is a word which signifies to be, to do, or to suffer; as,
Nedahyah, I am; Nedebahkoonewa, I rule; Nedebahkoonegoo, I am ruled.

Verbs are of three kinds, active, passive, and neuter.

A Verb Active expresses an action, and necessarily implies an agent
and an object acted upon; as, Nezhahgeah James, I love James.

A Verb Passive expresses passion or a suffering or the receiving of an
action, and implies an object acted upon, and an agent by which it is
acted upon; as, Chezhahwaneding, to be loved; John oojezhahwanemah
neen, John is loved by me.

A Verb Neuter expresses neither action nor passion, but being or a
state of being; as, Nenebah, I sleep; Nenahmahdub, I sit.

Verbs have number, person, mood and tense.

NUMBER AND PERSON.

Verbs have two numbers, the singular and the plural.

There are three persons in each number; as,

  Pers.  _Singular._                   _Plural._
    1.   Nezhahwanega, I love.         Nezhahwanegamin, we love.
    2.   Kezhahwanega, thou lovest.    Kezhahwanegaim, you love.
    3.   Zhawanega, he loves.          Zhahwanegawug, they love.

MOOD.

The moods are five, Indicative, Subjunctive, Imperative, Potential, and
the Infinitive.

The Indicative declares or affirms positively, or it asks a question;
as, Zhahwanega, he loves; Zhahwaneganah? Does he love?

The Subjunctive expresses action or passion in a doubtful manner;
as, Kespin zhahwanegaid, if he loves.

The Imperative is used for commanding, exhorting, and entreating;
as, Mahjahn keen, depart thou; Noodahmooyook, do thou listen.

The Potential implies possibility, liberty, power, will; as,
Tahgemewan kahnahbuge, it may rain; Kegahwesenemin kiya kahmenequamin,
we shall eat and drink.

The Infinitive simply expresses the signification of the verb;
as, Cheezechegang, to do; Chegegedoong, to speak.

TENSE.

Verbs have six tenses, the present, the imperfect, the perfect, the
pluperfect, the first and second future tenses.

The present tense represents a present action as taking place at the
time in which it is mentioned; as, Nebop, I laugh; Newob, I see;
Nedenadum, I think.

The imperfect tense denotes past action or event however distant,
finished, but without defining the exact time of its completion;
as, Oodanongezahbahneeg ahpe naquaskahwod, they were travelling to
the town when he met them.

The perfect tense refers not only to what is past but also conveys
an allusion to the present time; as, Ahzheh negegezhetoon
nemahzhenahegun, I have finished my letter.

The pluperfect tense represents a thing, not only as past, but also
as prior to some other point of time specified in the sentence;
as, Ahzehnegegezhetonahbun letter chebwabedahgweshing, I had finished
my letter before he arrived.

The first future tense represents the action as yet to come, either
with or without respect to the precise time when; as, Owh kezis
tahbemookahum wahbung, the sun will rise to-morrow.

The second future tense represents a future action that will be
accomplished before another future action; as, Negahwesenenahbun
nahwahquaig, I shall have dined at twelve o'clock.

OF THE FORMATION OF WORDS.


It is difficult with us to speak the words themselves.--The words
_odoon_, _onik_, _okod_, _ozid_, _okun_, do not mean respectively,
_mouth_, _arm_, _leg_, _foot_, _bone_; but _his mouth_, _his arm_, _his
leg_, _his foot_, _his bone_. By leaving out the letter _o_ we have the
words _mouth_, _arm_, _&c._ themselves: thus, _doon_, _nik_, _kod_,
_zid_, _kun_. The former is the usual way of speaking, the latter is
correct.

By the following illustration it will be better understood how words are
formed:

                        _my_      _thy_ or _your_   _his_

  Doon,     _a mouth_,  nedoon        kedoon,       odoon,
  Bid,      _a tooth_,  nebid,        kebid,        owebid,
  Daih,     _a heart_,  nedaih,       kedaih,       odaih,
  Kown,     _a liver_,  nekown,       kekown,       okown,
  Kun,      _a bone_,   nekun,        kekun,        okun,
  Skunze,   _a nail_,   neskunze,     keskunze,     oskunze,
  Kod,      _a leg_,    nekod,        kekod,        okod,
  Bowm,     _a thigh_,  nebowm,       kebowm,       obowm,
  Dis,      _a navel_,  nedis,        kedis,        odis,
  Pun,      _a light_,  nepun,        kepun,        opun,
  Zid,      _a foot_,   nezid,        kezid,        ozid,
  Yos,      _flesh_,    neyos,        keyos,        oweyos,
  Yowh,     _a body_,   neyowh,       keyowh,       oweyowh,
  Oose,     _father_,   noose,        koose,        osun,
  Gah,      _mother_,   negah,        kegah,        ogeen,
  Siyahn,   _brother_,  nesiyahn,     kesiyahn,     osiyayun,
  Shema,    _sister_,   neshema,      keshema,      oshemayun,
  Tahwug,   _an ear_,   netahwug,     ketahwug,     otahwug.

_Author of Spelling book:_

I am convinced that 'Spelling' is by Peter Jones, as he was commissioned
to put together a spelling book on June 2, 1828, and presented the
manuscript to a printer in York on June 19, 1828, for the Methodist
Indian Missionary School he ran, which Conference Missionary Society
was a Methodist society. Also, in his book _Life and journals of
Kah-ke-wa-quo-na-by_, in the journal entry for the 19th, it says,
"Arrived at York in the afternoon, and commenced getting a small Indian
spelling book, which I had written, printed at Mr. McKenzie's office."
and considering "Spelling" was only 12 printed pages--3 sheets of
paper--that, I think, does qualify as "a small Indian spelling
book."

_Syncope:_

Several words are presented in a partial syncope form. For example,
_gagiinawishkiwin_ to mean a fib, a lie or a falsehood, in the partial
syncope form is _ggiinawishkiwin_, and the full syncope form is
_ggiinwishkwin_. Summerfield presents this word as _Kenahweskewin,
n. falsehood_, which seems to match the partial syncope form of the
word. However, if this partial syncope is noted, so should the dozen
or so other words shown in partial syncope.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
