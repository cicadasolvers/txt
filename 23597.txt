BEAUTIES OF TENNYSON.




THE BROOK.


    I come from haunts of coot and hern,
      I make sudden sally
    And sparkle out among the fern,
      To bicker down a valley.

    By thirty hills I hurry down,
      Or slip between the ridges,
    By twenty thorps, a little town,
      And half a hundred bridges.

         *       *       *

    I chatter over stony ways,
      In little sharps and trebles,
    I bubble into eddying bays,
      I babble on the pebbles.

    With many a curve my banks I fret
      By many a field and fallow,
    And many a fairy foreland set
      With willow-weed and mallow.

         *       *       *

    And here and there a foamy lake
      Upon me, as I travel
    With many a silvery waterbreak
      Above the golden gravel,

    And draw them all along, and flow
      To join the brimming river,
    For men may come and men may go,
      But I go on for ever.

SONG FROM "MAUD."


    See what a lovely shell,
    Small and pure as a pearl,
    Lying close to my foot,
    Frail, but a work divine,
    Made so fairily well
    With delicate spire and whorl,
    How exquisitely minute,
    A miracle of design!

    What is it? a learned man
    Could give it a clumsy name.
    Let him name it who can,
    The beauty would be the same.

    The tiny cell is forlorn,
    Void of the little living will
    That made it stir on the shore.
    Did he stand at the diamond door
    Of his house in a rainbow frill?
    Did he push, when he was uncurl'd,
    A golden foot or a fairy horn
    Thro' his dim water-world.

    Slight, to be crushed with a tap
    Of my finger-nail on the sand,
    Small, but a work divine,
    Frail, but of force to withstand,
    Year upon year, the shock
    Of cataract seas that snap
    The three-decker's oaken spine
    Athwart the ledges of rock,
    Here on the Breton strand!

[Illustration: "SEE WHAT A LOVELY SHELL, LYING CLOSE TO MY FOOT."]




A FAREWELL.


    Flow down, cold rivulet, to the sea,
      Thy tribute wave deliver:
    No more by thee my steps shall be,
      For ever and for ever.

    Flow, softly flow, by lawn and lea,
      A rivulet then a river:
    Nowhere by thee my steps shall be,
      For ever and for ever.

    But here will sigh thine alder tree,
      And here thine aspen shiver;
    And here by thee will hum the bee,
      For ever and for ever.

    A thousand suns will stream on thee,
      A thousand moons will quiver;
    But not by thee my steps shall be,
      For ever and for ever.

SONG FROM "MAUD."


    Come into the garden, Maud,
      For the black bat, night, has flown,
    Come into the garden, Maud,
      I am here at the gate alone;
    And the woodbine spices are wafted abroad,
      And the musk of the roses blown.

    For a breeze of morning moves,
      And the planet of Love is on high,
    Beginning to faint in the light that she loves
      On a bed of daffodil sky,
    To faint in the light of the sun she loves,
      To faint in his light, and to die.

         *       *       *

    There has fallen a splendid tear
      From the passion-flower at the gate.
    She is coming, my dove, my dear;
      She is coming, my life, my fate;
    The red rose cries, "She is near, she is near;"
      And the white rose weeps, "She is late;"
    The larkspur listens, "I hear, I hear;"
      And the lily whispers, "I wait."

    She is coming, my own, my sweet;
      Were it ever so airy a tread,
    My heart would hear her and beat,
      Were it earth in an earthy bed;
    My dust would hear her and beat,
      Had I lain for a century dead;
    Would start and tremble under her feet,
      And blossom in purple and red.

[Illustration: "THE RED ROSE CRIES, 'SHE IS NEAR, SHE IS NEAR.'"]




BREAK, BREAK, BREAK.


    Break, break, break,
      On thy cold gray stones, O Sea!
    And I would that my tongue could utter
      The thoughts that arise in me.

    O well for the fisherman's boy,
      That he shouts with his sister at play!
    O well for the sailor lad,
      That he sings in his boat on the bay!

    And the stately ships go on
      To their haven under the hill;
    But O for the touch of a vanish'd hand,
      And the sound of a voice that is still!

    Break, break, break,
      At the foot of thy crags, O Sea!
    But the tender grace of a day that is dead
      Will never come back to me.

[Illustration: "BREAK, BREAK, BREAK, AT THE FOOT OF THY CRAGS, O SEA!"]




FROM "LOCKSLEY HALL."


    Love took up the glass of Time, and turn'd it in his glowing hands;
    Every moment, lightly shaken, ran itself in golden sands.

    Love took up the harp of Life, and smote on all the chords with might;
    Smote the chord of Self, that, trembling, pass'd in music out of sight.

    Many a morning on the moorland did we hear the copses ring,
    And her whisper throng'd my pulses with the fulness of the Spring.

    Many an evening by the waters did we watch the stately ships,
    And our spirits rush'd together at the touching of the lips.

    O my cousin, shallow-hearted! O my Amy, mine no more!
    O the dreary, dreary moorland! O the barren, barren shore!

[Illustration: "MANY AN EVENING BY THE WATERS DID WE WATCH THE STATELY
SHIPS."]




SONG FROM "MAUD."


    Go not, happy day,
      From the shining fields,
    Go not, happy day,
      Till the maiden yields.
    Rosy is the West,
      Rosy is the South,
    Roses are her cheeks,
      And a rose her mouth
    When the happy Yes
      Falters from her lips,
    Pass and blush the news
      Over glowing ships;
    Over blowing seas,
      Over seas at rest,
    Pass the happy news,
      Blush it thro' the West;
    Till the red man dance
      By his red cedar-tree,
    And the red man's babe
      Leap, beyond the sea.
    Blush from West to East,
      Blush from East to West,
    Till the West is East,
      Blush it thro' the West.
    Rosy is the West,
      Rosy is the South,
    Roses are her cheeks,
      And a rose her mouth.

[Illustration: "GO NOT, HAPPY DAY, TILL THE MAIDEN YIELDS."]




SONG FROM "THE PRINCESS."


    Sweet and low, sweet and low,
      Wind of the western sea,
    Low, low, breathe and blow,
      Wind of the western sea!
    Over the rolling waters go,
    Come from the dying moon, and blow,
      Blow him again to me;
    While my little one, while my pretty one, sleeps.

    Sleep and rest, sleep and rest,
      Father will come to thee soon;
    Rest, rest, on mother's breast,
      Father will come to thee soon;
    Father will come to his babe in the nest,
    Silver sails all out of the west
      Under the silver moon:
    Sleep, my little one, sleep, my pretty one, sleep.

[Illustration: "FATHER WILL COME TO HIS BABE IN THE NEST."]




LILIAN.


        Airy, fairy Lilian,
        Flitting, fairy Lilian,
    When I ask her if she love me,
    Claps her tiny hands above me,
        Laughing all she can;
    She'll not tell me if she love me,
        Cruel little Lilian.

        When my passion seeks
        Pleasance in love-sighs,
    She, looking thro' and thro' me
    Thoroughly to undo me,
        Smiling, never speaks:
    So innocent-arch, so cunning-simple,
    From beneath her gather'd wimple
      Glancing with black-beaded eyes,
    Till the lightning laughters dimple
        The baby-roses in her cheeks;
        Then away she flies.

      Prythee weep, May Lilian!
        Gayety without eclipse
      Wearieth me, May Lilian:
    Thro' my very heart it thrilleth
      When from crimson-threaded lips
    Silver-treble laughter trilleth:
      Prythee weep, May Lilian.

        Praying all I can,
    If prayers will not hush thee,
        Airy Lilian,
    Like a rose-leaf I will crush thee,
        Fairy Lilian.

[Illustration: AIRY, FAIRY LILIAN.]




RING OUT, WILD BELLS.


    Ring out, wild bells, to the wild sky,
        The flying cloud, the frosty light:
        The year is dying in the night;
    Ring out, wild bells, and let him die.

    Ring out the old, ring in the new,
        Ring, happy bells, across the snow:
        The year is going, let him go;
    Ring out the false, ring in the true.

    Ring out the grief that saps the mind,
        For those that here we see no more;
        Ring out the feud of rich and poor,
    Ring in redress to all mankind.

    Ring out a slowly dying cause,
        And ancient forms of party strife;
        Ring in the nobler modes of life,
    With sweeter manners, purer laws.

    Ring out the want, the care, the sin,
        The faithless coldness of the times;
        Ring out, ring out my mournful rhymes,
    But ring the fuller minstrel in.

    Ring out false pride in place and blood,
        The civic slander and the spite;
        Ring in the love of truth and right,
    Ring in the common love of good.

    Ring out old shapes of foul disease;
        Ring out the narrowing lust of gold;
        Ring out the thousand wars of old,
    Ring in the thousand years of peace.

    Ring in the valiant man and free,
        The larger heart, the kindlier hand;
        Ring out the darkness of the land,
    Ring in the Christ that is to be.

[Illustration: "RING OUT, WILD BELLS, TO THE WILD SKY."]




FROM "THE PRINCESS."


    Tears, idle tears, I know not what they mean,
    Tears from the depth of some divine despair
    Rise in the heart, and gather to the eyes,
    In looking on the happy Autumn-fields,
    And thinking of the days that are no more.

    Fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail,
    That brings our friends up from the underworld,
    Sad as the last which reddens over one
    That sinks with all we love below the verge;
    So sad, so fresh, the days that are no more.

    Ah, sad and strange as in dark summer dawns
    The earliest pipe of half-awaken'd birds
    To dying ears, when unto dying eyes
    The casement slowly grows a glimmering square;
    So sad, so strange, the days that are no more.

    Dear as remember'd kisses after death,
    And sweet as those by hopeless fancy feign'd
    On lips that are for others; deep as love,
    Deep as first love, and wild with all regret;
    O Death in Life, the days that are no more.

[Illustration: "TEARS, IDLE TEARS."]




SONG FROM "THE PRINCESS."


        The splendor falls on castle-walls
            And snowy summits old in story:
        The long light shakes across the lakes,
          And the wild cataract leaps in glory.
    Blow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying,
    Blow, bugle; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying.

        O hark, O hear! how thin and clear,
          And thinner, clearer, farther going!
        O sweet and far from cliff and scar
          The horns of Elfland faintly blowing!
    Blow, let us hear the purple glens replying:
    Blow, bugle; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying.

        O love, they die in yon rich sky,
          They faint on hill or field or river;
        Our echoes roll from soul to soul,
          And grow for ever and for ever.
    Blow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying,
    And answer, echoes, answer, dying, dying, dying.

[Illustration: "BLOW, BUGLE, BLOW, SET THE WILD ECHOES FLYING, BLOW,
BUGLE; ANSWER, ECHOES, DYING, DYING, DYING."]




FROM "ENOCH ARDEN."


    The mountain wooded to the peak, the lawns
    And winding glades high up like ways to Heaven,
    The slender coco's drooping crown of plumes
    The lightning flash of insect and of bird,
    The lustre of the long convolvuluses
    That coil'd around the stately stems, and ran
    Ev'n to the limit of the land, the glows
    And glories of the broad belt of the world,
    All these he saw; but what he fain had seen
    He could not see, the kindly human face,
    Nor ever hear a kindly voice, but heard
    The myriad shriek of wheeling ocean-fowl,
    The league-long roller thundering on the reef,
    The moving whisper of huge trees that branch'd
    And blossom'd in the zenith, or the sweep
    Of some precipitous rivulet to the wave,
    As down the shore he ranged, or all day long
    Sat often in the seaward-gazing gorge,
    A shipwreck'd sailor, waiting for a sail:
    No sail from day to day, but every day
    The sunrise broken into scarlet shafts
    Among the palms and ferns and precipices;
    The blaze upon the waters to the east;
    The blaze upon his island overhead;
    The blaze upon the waters to the west;
    Then the great stars that globed themselves in heaven,
    The hollower-bellowing ocean, and again
    The scarlet shafts of sunrise--but no sail.

[Illustration: "A SHIPWRECK'D SAILOR, WAITING FOR A SAIL."]




FROM "ENOCH ARDEN."


    But Enoch yearn'd to see her face again;
    'If I might look on her sweet face again
    And know that she is happy.' So the thought
    Haunted and harass'd him, and drove him forth
    At evening when the dull November day
    Was growing duller twilight, to the hill.
    There he sat down gazing on all below;
    There did a thousand memories roll upon him,
    Unspeakable for sadness. By and by
    The ruddy square of comfortable light,
    Far blazing from the rear of Philip's house,
    Allured him, as the beacon-blaze allures
    The bird of passage, till he madly strikes
    Against it, and beats out his weary life.

    For Philip's dwelling fronted on the street,
    The latest house to landward; but behind
    With one small gate that open'd on the waste,
    Flourish'd a little garden square and wall'd:
    And in it throve an ancient evergreen,
    A yew tree, and all round it ran a walk
    Of shingle, and a walk divided it:
    But Enoch shunn'd the middle walk and stole
    Up by the wall, behind the yew; and thence
    That which he better might have shunn'd, if griefs
    Like his have worse or better, Enoch saw.

[Illustration: "STOLE UP BY THE WALL, BEHIND THE YEW."]




THE CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE.


    I.

    Half a league, half a league,
    Half a league onward,
    All in the valley of Death
      Rode the six hundred.
    'Forward, the Light Brigade!'
    'Charge for the guns!' he said:
    Into the valley of Death
      Rode the six hundred.


    II.

    'Forward, the Light Brigade!'
    Was there a man dismay'd?
    Not tho' the soldier knew
      Some one had blunder'd:
    Their's not to make reply,
    Their's not to reason why,
    Their's but to do and die:
    Into the valley of Death
      Rode the six hundred.


    III.

    Cannon to right of them,
    Cannon to left of them,
    Cannon in front of them
      Volley'd and thunder'd;
    Storm'd at with shot and shell,
    Boldly they rode and well,
    Into the jaws of Death,
    Into the mouth of Hell
      Rode the six hundred.


    IV.

    Flash'd all their sabres bare,
    Flash'd as they turn'd in air,
    Sabring the gunners there,
    Charging an army, while
      All the world wonder'd:
    Plunged in the battery-smoke
    Right thro' the line they broke;
    Cossack and Russian
    Reel'd from the sabre-stroke
      Shatter'd and sunder'd.
    Then they rode back, but not
    Not the six hundred.


    V.

    Cannon to right of them,
    Cannon to left of them,
    Cannon behind them
      Volley'd and thunder'd;
    Storm'd at with shot and shell,
    While horse and hero fell,
    They that had fought so well
    Came thro' the jaws of Death,
    Back from the mouth of Hell,
    All that was left of them,
      Left of six hundred.


    VI.

    When can their glory fade?
    O the wild charge they made!
      All the world wondered.
    Honor the charge they made!
    Honor the Light Brigade,
      Noble six hundred!

[Illustration: "BOLDLY THEY RODE AND WELL."]




FROM "THE MAY QUEEN."


    You must wake and call me early, call me early, mother dear;
    To-morrow 'ill be the happiest time of all the glad New-year;
    Of all the glad New-year, mother, the maddest merriest day;
    For I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to be Queen o' the May.

    There's many a black black eye, they say, but none so bright as mine;
    There's Margaret and Mary, there's Kate and Caroline:
    But none so fair as little Alice in all the land they say,
    So I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to be Queen o' the May.

[Illustration: THE MAY QUEEN.]




SONG FROM "THE PRINCESS."


    As thro' the land at eve we went,
      And pluck'd the ripen'd ears,
    We fell out, my wife and I,
    O we fell out I know not why,
      And kiss'd again with tears,
    And blessings on the falling out
      That all the more endears,
    When we fall out with those we love
      And kiss again with tears!
    For when we came where lies the child
      We lost in other years,
    There above the little grave,
    O there above the little grave,
      We kiss'd again with tears.

[Illustration: "O THERE ABOVE THE LITTLE GRAVE, WE KISS'D AGAIN WITH
TEARS."]




FROM "HAROLD."


    _Tostig._ What for Norway then?
    He looks for land among us, he and his.

    _Harold._ Seven feet of English land, or something more,
    Seeing he is a giant.

    _Tostig._ That is noble!
    That sounds of Godwin.

    _Harold._ Come thou back, and be
    Once more a son of Godwin.

    _Tostig_ (_turns away_). O brother, brother,
    O Harold--

    _Harold_ (_laying his hand on Tostig's shoulder_). Nay then, come
    thou back to us!

    _Tostig_ (_after a pause turning to him_). Never shall any man
    say that I, that Tostig
    Conjured the mightier Harold from the North
    To do the battle for me here in England,
    Then left him for the meaner! thee!--
    Thou hast no passion for the House of Godwin--
    Thou hast but cared to make thyself a king--
    Thou hast sold me for a cry--
    Thou gavest thy voice against me in the Council--
    I hate thee, and despise thee, and defy thee.
    Farewell for ever!                              [_Exit._

    _Harold._ On to Stamford-bridge!

[Illustration: "NAY THEN, COME THOU BACK TO US!"]




FROM "THE REVENGE."


    And the sun went down, and the stars came out far over the summer sea,
    But never a moment ceased the fight of the one and the fifty-three.
    Ship after ship, the whole night long, their high-built galleons came,
    Ship after ship, the whole night long, with her battle-thunder and
      flame;
    Ship after ship, the whole night long, drew back with her dead and her
      shame.
    For some were sunk and many were shatter'd, and so could fight us no
      more--
    God of battles, was ever a battle like this in the world before?

    And the night went down, and the sun smiled out far over the summer
      sea,
    And the Spanish fleet with broken sides lay round us all in a ring;
    But they dared not touch us again, for they fear'd that we still could
      sting,
    So they watch'd what the end would be.
    And we had not fought them in vain,
    But in perilous plight were we,
    Seeing forty of our poor hundred were slain,
    And half of the rest of us maim'd for life
    In the crash of the cannonades and the desperate strife;
    And the sick men down in the hold were most of them stark and cold,
    And the pikes were all broken or bent, and the powder was all of it
      spent;
    And the masts and the rigging were lying over the side.

BATTLE-THUNDER AND FLAME."]

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
