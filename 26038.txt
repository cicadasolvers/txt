Drawings and Pharmacy in al-Zahr[=a]w[=i]aEuro(TM)s
10th-Century Surgical Treatise

_by Sami Hamarneh_


_Probably the earliest independent work in Arabic Spain to embrace the
whole of medical knowledge of the time is the encyclopedic al-Tasr[=i]f,
written in the late 10th century by Ab[=u] al-Q[=a]sim al-Zahr[=a]w[=i],
also known as Abulcasis. Consisting of 30 treatises, it is the only
known work of al-Zahr[=a]w[=i] and it brought him high prestige in the
western world._

_Here we are concerned only with his last treatise, on surgery. With its
many drawings of surgical instruments, intended for the instruction of
apprentices, its descriptions of formulas and medicinal preparations,
and its lucid observations on surgical procedures, this treatise is
perhaps the oldest of its kind._

_Scholars today have available a translation of the text and
reproductions of the drawings, but many of the latter are greatly
modified from the originals._

_This study reproduces examples of al-Zahr[=a]w[=i]aEuro(TM)s original
illustrations, compares some with early drawings based on them, and
comments on passages in the treatise of interest to students of pharmacy
and medical therapy._

THE AUTHOR: _Sami Hamarneh undertook this research into the history of
medicine in connection with his duties as associate curator of medical
sciences in the United States National Museum, Smithsonian Institution._


THE INTRODUCTION OF THE WRITINGS of Ab[=u] al-Q[=a]sim Khalaf ibn
aEuro~Abb[=a]s al-Zahr[=a]w[=i]--better known as Abulcasis (d. ca. 1013)--to
Western Europe was through the Latin translation of his surgical
treatise (maq[=a]lah) by Gerard of Cremona (d. 1187).[1] The response to
this treatise, thereafter, was much greater than the attention paid to
the surgery of any of the three renowned physicians of the Eastern
Caliphate: al-R[=a]z[=i] (Latin, Rhazes, d. ca. 925), the greatest
clinician in Arabic medicine; al-Maj[=u]s[=i] (Haly Abb[=a]s, d. 994),
the author of the encyclopedic medical work, _al_-_Malak[=i]_;[2] and
Ibn S[=i]n[=a] (Avicenna, 980-1037), the author of the famous
_al-Q[=a]n[=u]n f[=i] al-[T.]ibb_, a codification of the whole of
medical knowledge. Because of the widespread dissemination of this Latin
version in medieval Europe beginning with the latter part of the 12th
century, al-Zahr[=a]w[=i] attained more prestige in the West than he did
in Arabic Spain, his native country, or in any other part of the Islamic
world.[3]

The fame attached to this surgical treatise, the 30th and last in
al-Zahr[=a]w[=i]aEuro(TM)s encyclopedic work _al-Ta[s.]r[=i]f Liman aEuro~Ajiza
aEuro~an al-TaaEuro(TM)l[=i]f_, is founded on certain merits. The text is
characterized by lucidity, careful description, and a touch of
original observation of the surgical operations to which the treatise
as a whole is devoted.[4] Al-Zahr[=a]w[=i] furnishes his own drawings
of the surgical and dental instruments he used, devised, or
recommended for a more efficient performance. The illustrations were
intended to provide instructional material for apprentices--whom
al-Zahr[=a]w[=i] calls his children--as well as for the benefit of
those who would read the work later on.[5] The treatise is probably
the oldest one known today that contains such instructive surgical
illustrations and text.[6]

This surgical treatise has been investigated, translated, and commented
upon by eminent historians of medicine and surgery to whose works I
shall refer in this article. However, the pharmaceutic and therapeutic
details of the treatise have been somewhat overlooked.

As to the various illustrations of the surgical instruments (over 200
figures in all), an almost complete representation of samples has been
introduced by Channing,[7] Leclerc,[8] Gurlt,[9] Sudhoff,[10] and
others. Nevertheless, a good number of the reproduced drawings are
greatly modified, most likely having been influenced by earlier
illustrations in several Latin and vernacular versions of the
treatise.[11] This becomes clearer on comparison with seven Arabic
manuscripts that have not been fully examined by Western scholars before
and that--in several instances--show more authentic drawings of
al-Zahr[=a]w[=i]aEuro(TM)s surgical instruments than any heretofore
published.[12]

This article therefore, is an attempt to present a sample of these
illustrations with brief comments regarding certain figures and passages
of interest to pharmacy and medical therapy.

Al-Zahr[=a]w[=i] frequently introduces his treatises with brief
instructive and sometimes informative preludes. However, in launching
the last treatise of _al-Ta[s.]r[=i]f_ he expounded in a most
interesting and illuminating manner the status of surgery during his
time. He also explains the reasons that forced him to write on this
topic and why he wished to include, as he did, precautions, advice,
instructional notes, and beautifully illustrated surgical drawings. For
example, the prelude to the treatise mentions four incidents that he
witnessed, all ending with tragic results because of the ignorance of
physicians who attempted to operate on patients without the proper
training in anatomy and surgical manipulation. "For if one does not have
the knowledge of anatomy," al-Zahr[=a]w[=i] protests, then "... he is
apt to fall in errors that lead to death as I have seen it happen to
many."[13]

Al-Zahr[=a]w[=i] divides his surgical treatise into three sections
(abw[=a]b). In the first section (56 chapters)[14] he elaborates upon
the uses and disadvantages of cautery in general. And on the ground that
"fire touches only the ailing part ... without causing much damage to
surrounding area," as caustic medicine does, he prefers cautery by fire
(al-kay bi al-n[=a]r) to cautery by medicine (bi al-daw[=a]).[15] This,
he adds, "became clear to us through lifelong experience, diligent
practice, and thorough investigations of facts."[16]

  original Arabic manuscript (TA1/4b. MS. 91), courtesy

  Sudhoff, _Chirurgie_, courtesy National Library of
  Medicine.]

He also proposes that instruments made of iron are more practical in
many ways than those made of gold, because often, when gold instruments
are put in fire, they either are not heated enough or are overheated,
causing the gold to melt.

  [Illustration: Figure 10.--Dental scrapers. _Top_, from
  original Arabic manuscript (Vel. 2491), courtesy SA1/4leymaniye

  Channing, _Albucasis_.]

Al-Zahr[=a]w[=i] gently refutes the superstition that cautery is "good
only in springtime," and states that "under the right conditions of the
bodyaEuro(TM)s humors it could be used in all seasons."[17] Although he
recommends cautery rather highly, he never minimizes the importance of
treatment by drugs. Actually, he encourages the use of drugs, before,
with, and after cauterization.[18] For example, in chapter 16 on "the
cauterization of eyelid when its hair grows reversedly into the eye," he
recommends treatment by cautery and by medicine. In cautery, the area
where fire is to be placed is marked with ink in the shape of a myrtle
leaf. In drug treatment, the caustic medicine is applied to the eyelid
over a paper in the shape of a myrtle leaf (fig. 2).

  original Arabic manuscript (TA1/4b. MS. 91), courtesy
  UniversitA¤tsbibliothek TA1/4bingen. _Bottom_, from Leclerc,
  _Abulcasis_.]

In chapter 17 the author refers to an ancient method regarding cautery
of the fistula in the inner corner of the eye. After incising the
fistula, one "dirham" (derived from the Greek "drachma," which is equal
to about 2.97 grams)[19] of melted lead is poured into it through a fine
funnel used for cauterization (fig. 3).

  teeth. _Top_, from original Arabic manuscript (TA1/4b. MS. 91),

  _Right_, from Channing, _Albucasis_.]

In like manner, al-Zahr[=a]w[=i] discusses cautery of the stomach and
the "cold liver" in chapters 26 and 27, respectively. The drawings
therein represent shapes of the burns on the skin (fig. 4) and marks of
ink to be drawn beneath the cartilage of the ribs (fig. 5) for the
purpose of spotting the area of operation. Here also he describes
carefully and clearly the methods of applying cautery and the types,
position, and number of tools employed in each case. He likewise depicts
(in chapter 45) instruments used in the treatment of hernia (fig. 6).

The second section (b[=a]b), with about 99 chapters,[20] deals with
incision, puncturing, venesection, cupping, surgery on abscesses, and
the withdrawal of arrows from the body. Al-Zahr[=a]w[=i] warns that
ignorance in such operations may lead to damage of an artery or vein,
causing loss of blood "by which life is sustained."[21] Moreover, needle
and thread (more than one kind is mentioned) for the stitching of wounds
are repeatedly recommended.

According to al-Zahr[=a]w[=i], foreign bodies that lodge in the ear
(chapter 6) are of four origins: (1) "mineral stones" or substances
resembling mineral stones such as iron and glass; (2) plant seeds
(chick-peas and beans); (3) liquids, such as water and vinegar; and (4)
animals, such as fleas. Several instruments are recommended for the
removal of such foreign bodies--fine tweezers shaped like a dropper
(fig. 7), a syringe with plunger-pump, and a tube made of silver or
copper (fig. 8). Also of interest to pharmacy and therapy is the advice
in regard to the use of lubricants to be applied before administering
these fine instruments into the bodyaEuro(TM)s cavities.

Chapter 24 is concerned with the treatment of the polypus that grows in
the nose. The various kinds (including cancer growth), shapes, and
colors of this type tumor and its treatment by surgery or medicine are
described. A hollowed nose-dropper made of metal in the shape of a small
kerosene lamp[22] is suggested (fig. 9). The dropper is held by its
handle while its contents are heated before use. Applying heat to nose
drops was probably proposed because it serves two purposes: it allows
easier flow of the "duhn," or the fatty substance used, and it raises
the temperature of the drops to that of the body.

In his discussion on dental hygiene,[23] al-Zahr[=a]w[=i] describes
scrapers and dental forceps for teeth cleaning and extraction (figs. 10,
11) and brings in a few points of historical interest.[24] He warns of
the common error of extracting the adjacent healthy tooth instead of the
ailing one due to the patientaEuro(TM)s sense deception. For a gargle he
prescribes salt water, vinegar, and wine (shar[=a]b). To stop hemorrhage
he used blue vitriol (al-z[=a]j)--copper sulfate in our modern
terminology.

In chapter 33 al-Zahr[=a]w[=i] discusses bridge-making for the
consolidation of shaky teeth (fig. 12). He prefers the use of stable
gold over silver which, he says, putrifies and rots in a short time. In
a rational approach, he also suggests that the fallen tooth itself, or a
similar one shaped out of a cowaEuro(TM)s bone, be installed and connected with
adjacent, stable teeth by a bridge.

Now, turning to chapter 36, we find al-Zahr[=a]w[=i] describing a
knife-thin tongue depressor (fig. 13) that he used to facilitate the
examination of inflamed tonsils and other swellings of the throat; it
was made of silver or copper. And in chapter 37 (chapter 34 in Bes.
503), he describes the excision of an inflamed uvula by surgery. In the
same chapter, he also mentions the use of instruments made of steel. Of
pharmaceutical interest is the following free translation of the formula
he prescribes "as a milder treatment by fumigation ... to be resorted to
only when the swelling is subsiding":[25]

  Take pennyroyal [_Mentha pulegium_ Linn.], absinthe
  [_Artemisia maritima_ Linn.], thyme, rue, hyssop, camomile,
  abrotanum [_Artemisia abrotanum_ Linn.], and other similar
  herbs. Put all in a casserole and cover them with vinegar.
  Then close tightly with clay [_lutum-sapientiae_]--except
  for a small hole in the middle of the cover--and boil.
  Connect one end of a hollowed instrument, a crude form of an
  inhaler [fig. 14], with the hole in the cover and insert the
  other end, which contains the nozzle, into the patientaEuro(TM)s
  mouth, allowing the vapor to rise up to the uvula. And if
  you are not able to secure this instrument, take a straw and
  attach its end to an egg-shell. The egg-shell will prevent
  burns in the patientaEuro(TM)s mouth that might be caused by the
  heated vapor.

Al-Zahr[=a]w[=i] repeats in chapter 53, on cancer, what Greek physicians
had said earlier, that cancer could be removed by surgery only at its
first stage and when found in a removable part of the body, such as the
breast. Therefore, he confesses that neither he nor any one else he knew
of ever applied surgery with success on advanced cancer.[26]

Of special interest in chapter 59 is the metallic "syringe" (fig. 15)
used to inject medicinal solutions into the bladder: "The hollow passage
[of the syringe] should be exactly equal to the plunger it contains and
no more, so that when such fluids from an excess of humors are aspirated
they will be drawn out, and likewise when the solutions are injected
they will be pushed in easily." Such description of the use of a
"bladder syringe" in the late 10th century clearly points to the
practical and interesting approach to surgery in _al-Ta[s.]r[=i]f_.
Moreover, his description of the removal of a stone from the bladder--an
operation we now call lithotomy--is considered a contribution to bladder
surgery.

One of the earliest recorded operations for the extractions of two dead
fetuses from the womb is clearly described in chapter 76. The account of
this case shows not only al-Zahr[=a]w[=i]aEuro(TM)s intelligent approach as a
shrewd observer but also his clinical and surgical ability.

Drawings of bulb-syringe instruments used for administering enemas in
ailments of the rectum and for the treatment of diarrhea and colic are
depicted in chapter 83. The text describes several kinds of syringes
made of silver, porcelain, and copper in various sizes (fig. 16). Of
particular interest is an illustration of a syringe, especially
recommended for children, to which a piece of leather (jildah) is
attached (fig. 17). This instrument is a precursor of our modern bulb
syringe.

In chapter 84 al-Zahr[=a]w[=i] turns to the treatment of various wounds.
He prescribes the following powder formula for use: "Take olibanum
[frankincense] and dragonaEuro(TM)s blood,[27] two parts of each, and three
parts of slaked or unslaked lime. Pound them well, pass through a sieve
and apply the powder to the wound." In cases of damaged blood vessels,
he tied the arteries by ligature, a practice of which he was a pioneer.
In another chapter he describes four methods for suturing the
intestines.

Al-Zahr[=a]w[=i], being associated with war casualties and writing his
treatise about the end of the 10th century, no doubt had the experience
of dealing with cases involving injuries caused by arrows. The text in
chapter 94 discloses his observations in elaborate investigations
regarding the extraction of various kinds of arrows from the body.[28]
Accordingly, several kinds of hooks and forceps for removing arrows are
described and depicted in the treatise (see fig. 18). Al-Zahr[=a]w[=i]aEuro(TM)s
mention of Turkish bows and arrows led Freind to believe, erroneously,
that the author of the treatise must have lived in the 12th century,[29]
notwithstanding the fact that Turkish bows and arrows were in common use
in the latter part of the 10th century.

  _Abulcasis_.]

The next chapter, on cupping, mentions the use of cups made of horns,
wood, copper, or glass, according to circumstances and the availability
of material. The methods of treatment are divided into two kinds: dry
cupping, with or without fire, and wet cupping (see fig. 19). He
prescribes ointments and aromatic and medicated waters to be applied
before and after cupping to facilitate healing. Only when cupping is not
possible, as on the nose, fingers, and similar parts of the human body,
does he propose the use of leeches for treatment.[30] Evidently this is
an indication that he did not, as generally supposed, encourage the
widespread use of leeches.

The third and final section, of 35 chapters, deals with the reduction,
luxation, and treatment of injured bones, including fracture of the
pelvis. The advices and warnings in the prelude of this section appear
to repeat some of al-Zahr[=a]w[=i]aEuro(TM)s sayings that had been covered in
his previous introductions. The text, however, presents many facets of
interest to the health professions. It elaborates upon the application
of various forms of bandages and plasters in a variety of operations.
Al-Zahr[=a]w[=i]aEuro(TM)s detailed description relating to fractures of bones
is a fine anatomical document of historical interest. He illustrates and
describes special methods for tying injured or broken bones, and he
suggests that bandages made of soft linen be less and less tight as
distance increases from the injured place (chapter 1). For the
protection of areas adjacent to the injured part against contact with
edges of splints he advocates padding with soft gauze and carded wool.
In some cases, to guard against swelling, he preferred a delay of one or
more days in applying bandages over splints. Al-Zahr[=a]w[=i] also
devised and depicted many kinds and shapes of splints for use in simple
and compound fractures of the head, shoulders, arms, fingers, etc. (see
fig. 20). For example, in discussing the reduction of the humerus, he
recommends a splint consisting of a smooth, thin stick bent in the shape
of a bow with two strings, each attached to one end of the stick (fig.
21). The injured bone is then placed in the middle of the bent splint
for reduction while the patient is seated on a chair. Tying is applied
only when there is no "hot" swelling (chapter 11). One of the remarkable
observations made in this section is the description of the paralysis
caused by fracture of the spine.

Of interest to historians of medical therapy and pharmacy are the
recipes for poultices that al-Zahr[=a]w[=i] recommends for use over
fractured bones. For example, he gives the following recipe for one such
poultice: "Take the so-called 'millaEuro(TM)s dust' [ghub[=a]r al-rah[=a]],
which is the part of the wheat flour that clings to the walls of the
mill during grinding [lub[=a]b al-daq[=i]q], and, without sifting away
the bran, knead with white-of-egg to a medium consistency, and apply."
Another, more elaborate, recipe calls for 10 dirhams each of the roots
of wild pomegranate [_Glossostemon bruguieri_ D.C.], chickling vetch
[the grass pea, _Lathymus sativus_], and white marshmallow; 5 dirhams
each of myrrh and aloes; 6 dirhams of white gum Arabic [_Acacia_]; and
20 dirhams of bole [friable earthy clay consisting largely of hydrous
silicates of aluminum and magnesium, usually colored red because of
impurities of iron oxide]. Procedure was to pound all ingredients
gently, pass them through a sieve, and knead with water or white-of-egg
(chapter 1).

The question arises as to whether al-Zahr[=a]w[=i] did any human
dissection. The answer is uncertain because our knowledge of his life is
fragmentary. However, he gives no clue to the dissection of humans in
any of the 30 treatises of _al-Ta[s.]r[=i]f_--his only known
writings--and there is no evidence that he practiced it in secret. His
upright attitude as a Muslim who repeatedly emphasized his adherence to
his faith suggests that he relied completely on animal dissection and
the writings of his Greek-Roman and Islamic predecessors. Physicians in
both the Islamic domain and in Christendom for many centuries were
hostile to the idea of human dissection for any purpose because of their
traditional socio-religious convictions, considering it an unethical and
undignified practice. Perhaps it has been al-Zahr[=a]w[=i]aEuro(TM)s original
contributions to surgery, his enthusiasm in emphasizing the value of
anatomical knowledge, and his recognition of the necessity that only
well-educated, well-trained doctors should perform surgery that have led
some medical historians to wonder whether he did human dissection at
some time in his long years of experience.


In Summary

The few examples of illustrations of surgical instruments given here
indicate that the Arabic manuscripts, in general, have preserved the
original, oriental, artistic features of the drawings in a way that has
been overlooked in Latin and vernacular versions of _al-Ta[s.]r[=i]f_.

In presenting his personal observations and original ideas on surgery
late in life, al-Zahr[=a]w[=i], for the most part, was inspired by a
thorough acquaintance with Greek and Arabic medical literature
supplemented by lifelong intelligent observation and experience.

Through its descriptions and illustrations, the surgical treatise of
al-Zahr[=a]w[=i] very likely played a significant role in the designing
of improved surgical instruments in the Middle Ages. Also, the treatise
no doubt promoted the development of improved surgical techniques in
Islam and, through its translations, promoted these techniques to an
even greater extent in the West, a fact that justifies the fame of this
treatise as the highest expression of the development of surgery in
Arabic Spain--a treatise whose influence continued to the Renaissance.
It contributed in no small measure to the idea of equipping learned and
well-trained surgeons with the best surgical tools and techniques of the
time; moreover, it encouraged the invention of new instruments to meet
differing circumstances and special conditions. These tools no doubt
greatly facilitated the work of the surgeon.

Throughout the text of _al-Ta[s.]r[=i]f_ al-Zahr[=a]w[=i] gave careful
attention to the importance of pharmaceutical preparations in the
healing art, including cases requiring surgery.

  [2] Mohammad S. Abu Ganima, in _Abul-Kasim ein Forscher der

  description of operations in al-Maj[=u]s[=i]aEuro(TM)s surgery is
  clearer than that in al-Zahr[=a]w[=i]aEuro(TM)s--a statement which
  does not seem acceptable.

  [6] Fielding H. Garrison (_An Introduction of the History of

  in reference to "Sudhoff and others," that many drawings
  earlier than those of al-Zahr[=a]w[=i] have been discovered
  in medieval manuscripts. However, Garrison overlooked the
  fact that al-Zahr[=a]w[=i]aEuro(TM)s surgical illustrations were
  mainly depicted for instructional purposes--a unique
  approach. It should be noted also that al-Zahr[=a]w[=i] died
  almost a century earlier than Garrison thought. See also

  edition, which has many merits. Moreover, the surgical
  illustrations (reproduced from the Huntington and Marsh

  influenced by ChanningaEuro(TM)s edition more than Leclerc admits.
  Leclerc consulted several Arabic copies of the treatise as
  well as Latin and vernacular translations, but only a few of
  these Arabic manuscripts are considered complete. The Arabic
  manuscripts studied for the present article are not the same
  as those used by Leclerc. See also LeclercaEuro(TM)s monumental

  figures. In the text and illustrations, Gurlt relied upon
  LeclercaEuro(TM)s translation and modified drawings of the surgical
  instruments; nevertheless, he presents a brief, systematic
  study--probably the best so far--of the entire treatise.

  Mittelalter_, Leipzig, 1918 (hereinafter referred to as
  Sudhoff, _Chirurgie_), vol. 2, pp. 16-84, with a few plates.
  Although Sudhoff consulted the fragmentary Arabic manuscript
  indexed as "Cod. Arab. 1989" in Gotha, Germany, he relied
  mainly upon Latin versions of the treatise and the
  illustrations contained in them.

  [11] See Leclerc, _Abulcasis_, in introduction.

  [12] The seven Arabic manuscripts are indexed as "Berlin MS.
  Or. fol. 91," temporarily at UniversitA¤tsbibliothek
  TA1/4bingen, in Germany; "Escorial MS. Arabe No. 876," at
  Biblioteca del Monasterio de San Lorenzo el Real de El
  Escorial, in Spain; "Wien MS. Cod. N.F. 476 A.," at
  Oesterreichische Nationalbibliothek, in Vienna; and "Ali
  Emiri Arabi No. 2854," "Be[s,]ir A[)g]a Nos. 502 and 503,"
  and "Veliyyudin No. 2491," all at SA1/4leymaniye Umumi
  KA1/4tA1/4phanesi MA1/4dA1/4rlA1/4[)g]A1/4, in Istanbul. Hereinafter these
  manuscripts are referred to, respectively, as TA1/4b. MS. 91;
  Esc. 876; Wien 476 A; Ali 2854; Bes. 502; Bes. 503; and Vel.
  2491. The Smithsonian Institution recently obtained a
  microfilm copy of Bankipore Manuscript No. 17 from the Khuda
  Bakhsh O. P. Library, Patna (Bihar), India. This manuscript,
  containing only the 30th treatise of _al-Ta[s.]r[=i]f_, was
  copied in 1189; therefore, it is the earliest dated Arabic
  manuscript of the surgical treatise known to exist. The
  surgical illustrations therein add weight to the belief that
  the Arabic manuscripts show more originality in the drawings
  than do the later copied versions, which often were
  inaccurate and possibly distorted. About ten other
  illustrations from the Arabic manuscript in Istanbul indexed
  as "Topkapi MS. No. 1990" (which contains 215 beautifully
  illustrated figures) were presented by A. S. Aoenver and
  HA1/4seyin Usman in an extract titled "Me[s,]hur Arab Cerrahi
  ElbA1/4lkasimi Zehravi ve onum KitabA1/4l Cerrahiyesi," Istanbul,
  1935. See also Aoenver, _[S,]erefeddin Sabuncuo[)g]lu: KitabA1/4l

  Commonly Called Albucasis," _Annals of Anatomy and Surgery_,
  July-December, 1883, vol. 8, pp. 24-25, gives a translation
  of only the first part of the introduction.

  [14] There are 56 chapters listed in almost all manuscripts
  and commentary works I checked except TA1/4b. MS. 91 and Esc.
  876, where only 55 chapters are listed.

  [15] Al-Zahr[=a]w[=i] mentions several caustic medicines
  used in cautery, among which are garlic, mustard, melted
  lead, slaked or unslaked lime with or without "common" soap,
  Thapsia (_Ruta graveolens_ Linn.), and juice of the Oriental
  cashew nut (_Senecarpus anacardium_ Linn.).

  [16] Vel. 2491, fol. 106; Bes. 502, fol. 523r-524v.

  [17] Al-Zahr[=a]w[=i] criticizes those who interpret the
  saying "cautery is the end of treatment" to mean that
  cauterization is the best and only conclusive treatment at
  the physicianaEuro(TM)s disposal. He points out that other
  treatments, such as drugs, should be resorted to first, and
  used until they prove of no avail; and he states that only
  after cautery proves to be the cure should it be considered
  the completion of medical treatment--"al-kay [=a]khir
  al-[t.]ibb." See Vel. 2491, fol. 106; and Bes. 502, fol.
  524r-525v.

  [18] For healing, soothing, or emollient purposes,
  al-Zahw[=a]r[=i] suggested medications, such as egg white,
  salt water (normal saline), sap of psyllium, several
  ointments, "duhn" of rose, and other "adh[=a]n" (plural of
  "duhn," the fatty or oily essences extracted from various
  substances through pharmaceutical processes).

  [19] For a more accurate estimate of the equivalence of
  "dirham" according to the area in which the measurement was
  taken, the reader may consult Walter Hinz, _Islamische Masse
  und Gewichte umgerechnet ins metrische System_, Leiden,
  1955, pt. 1, pp. 2-8; and George C. Miles, _Early Arabic
  Glass Weights and Stamps_, New York, 1948, p. 6.

  [20] The contents of several manuscripts (such as Ali 2854,
  Wien 476 A, Bes. 503, and TA1/4b. MS. 91) give different
  numbers.

  [21] See, for example, TA1/4b. MS. 91, fol. 45v; and Bes. 502,

  [24] It is regrettable that Franz Rosenthal in his fine
  article "Bibliographical Notes on Medieval Muslim Dentistry"
  (_Bulletin of the History of Medicine_, 1960, vol. 34, pp.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
