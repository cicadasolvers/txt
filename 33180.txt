                                PREFACE.


Among the Hymns in the following collection will be found many which are
not of the commonly recognized metres. Some of these are already set to
music of their own. Others can readily be adapted by the choir-leader to
the simple chants which are now generally found in our collections of
Sacred Music.

An asterisk prefixed to the author's name indicates that some change has
been made in the hymn by the present compilers.

The titles of the Supplementary Hymns in the present edition have been
introduced _within_ the original table of contents, instead of forming a
separate series at the end.

  According to Thy gracious word,                                     139
  Acquaint thee, O spirit, acquaint thee with God,                    199
  Affliction's faded form draws nigh,                                 329
  Ages, ages have departed,                                           439
  A holy air is breathing round,                                      157
  All around us, fair with flowers,                                   306
  All from the sun's uprise,                                          495
  All men are equal in their birth,                                   182
  All-seeing God! 'tis Thine to know,                                 288
  All ye nations, praise the Lord,                                    499
  Almighty Father! Thou hast many a blessing,                         217
  Almighty God! in humble prayer,                                      43
  Almighty Spirit, now behold,                                        594
  Am I a soldier of the cross,                                        311
  An offering at the shrine of power,                                 426
  Another day its course has run,                                     372
  Another hand is beckoning us,                                       404
  Approach not the altar with gloom in thy soul,                      464
  As down in the sunless retreats of the ocean,                        96
  As every day Thy mercy spares,                                       59
  As oft, with worn and weary feet,                                   113
  As the hart, with eager looks,                                      226
  As the sun's enlivening eye,                                         69
  Author of good, we rest on Thee,                                    260
  A voice from the desert,                                            103
  A voice upon the midnight air,                                      131
  Awake, my soul! lift up thine eyes,                                 318
  Awake, my soul! stretch every nerve,                                315
  Awake, our souls, away, our fears,                                  541
  A wondrous star our pioneer,                                        424
  Bear on, my soul! the bitter cross,                                 532
  Before Jehovah's awful throne,                                       18
  Behold, night's shadows fade,                                       550
  Behold, the Prince of Peace,                                        112
  Behold the son, how bright,                                         170
  Be near us, O Father, through night's silent hour,                  556
  Beneath the shadow of the cross,                                    564
  Beneath the thick but struggling clouds,                            295
  Beneath Thy trees to-day we meet,                                   459
  Be still! be still! for all around,                                   4
  Be still, my heart! these anxious cares,                            323
  Be Thou, O God, by night, by day,                                   551
  Birds have their quiet rest,                                        126
  Bless, O Lord, each opening year,                                   566
  Blessed be Thy name forever,                                         55
  Blessed, blessed are the dead,                                      348
  Blest are the pure in heart,                                        281
  Bread of heaven, on thee we feed,                                   153
  Breast the wave, Christian, when it is strongest,                   317
  Brightest and best of the sons of the morning,                      108
  Brother, hast thou wandered far,                                    195
  Brother, the angels say,                                            358
  Brother, thou art gone before us,                                   403
  Brother, though from yonder sky,                                    405
  Brother, will you slight the message,                               511
  Burden of shame and woe,                                            133
  By cool Siloam's shady rill,                                        444
  By earth hemmed in, by earth oppressed,                             455
  Call the Lord thy sure salvation,                                   534
  Calm on the bosom of thy God,                                       410
  Calm on the listening ear of night,                                 106
  Cheek grow pale, but heart be vigorous,                             320
  Child, amidst the flowers at play,                                   98
  Christ to the young man said,                                       569
  Clay to clay, and dust to dust,                                     406
  Climb we the mountain afar,                                         440
  Come at the morning hour,                                           463
  Come, kingdom of our God,                                           584
  Come, said Jesus' sacred voice,                                     121
  Come, Thou Almighty King,                                           480
  Come to Jesus, O my brothers,                                       161
  Come to me, thoughts of heaven,                                     519
  Come to the house of prayer,                                          1
  Come to the land of peace,                                          360
  Come unto me, when shadows darkly gather,                           160
  "Come who will," the voice from heaven,                             159
  Come, ye disconsolate, where'er ye languish,                        162
  Come, ye who love the Lord,                                           3
  Commit thou all thy griefs,                                         254
  Creator of all, through whose all-seeing might,                     558
  Cross, reproach and tribulation,                                    535
  Darkness o'er the world was brooding,                               104
  Dark were the paths our Master trod,                                128
  Daughter of Zion, awake from thy sadness,                           583
  Daughter of Zion! from the dust,                                    179
  Day by day the manna fell,                                           30
  Dear as Thou wast, and justly dear,                                 407
  Deem not that they are blest alone,                                 326
  Down the dark future; through long generations,                     421
  Earth's busy sounds, and ceaseless din,                             481
  Ere to the world again we go,                                       503

  Eternal God! Almighty Cause,                                        471
  Ever patient, loving, meek,                                         120
  Every bird that upward springs,                                     544
  Fading, still fading, the last beam is shining,                     370
  Faint the earth, and parched with drought,                          598
  Faint not, poor traveller, though the way,                          322

  Feeble, helpless, how shall I,                                      214
  Flung to the heedless winds,                                        428
  Followers of Christ! arise,                                         542

  Gently fall the dews of eve,                                        335
  Give to the winds thy fears,                                        256

  Hallelujah! best and sweetest,                                      498
  Hark! the glad sound, the Saviour comes,                            109
  Hark! through the waking earth,                                     188
  Hasten, Lord, to my release,                                        216
  Hast thou, midst life's empty noises,                               301
  Hath not thy heart within thee burned,                               90
  Hear, Father, hear our prayer,                                      488
  Hear what God, the Lord, hath spoken,                               192
  Heave, mighty ocean, heave,                                         430
  Heaven is a state of rest from sin,                                 232
  Heavenly Father, to whose eye,                                      493
  He knelt, the Saviour knelt and prayed,                             132
  He lived as none but he has lived,                                  125
  Heralds of creation! cry,                                           465
  Here, in this place of prayer,                                       12
  He sendeth sun, he sendeth shower,                                  264
  He was there alone, when even,                                      118
  Holy and reverend is the name,                                      491
  Holy Father, Thou hast taught me,                                   528
  Holy, holy, holy Lord God Almighty,                                  49
  Holy Son of God most high,                                          114
  Holy Spirit, source of gladness,                                    483
  House of our God, with cheerful anthems ring,                       397
  How beauteous were the marks divine,                                124
  How blest the righteous when he dies,                               350
  How dear is the thought, that the angels of God,                    355
  How gentle God's commands,                                          258
  How glad the tone when summer's sun,                                394
  How happy is be, born or taught,                                    279
  How little of ourselves we know,                                    325
  How long, O Lord, his brother's blood,                              185
  How shall we praise Thee, Lord of light,                             25
  How sweet, how calm, this Sabbath morn,                             374
  How sweetly flowed the gospel's sound,                              119
  Hush the loud cannon's roar,                                        184
  I am free! I am free! I have broken away,                           244
  I cannot always trace the way,                                       74
  If love the noblest, purest, best,                                  146
  If on our daily course our mind,                                    304
  In pleasant lands have fallen the lines,                            433
  In the broad fields of heaven,                                      413
  In the cross of Christ we glory,                                    145
  In the morning I will pray,                                         364
  In the Saviour's hour of death,                                     134
  In Thy courts let peace be found,                                    14
  In time of tribulation,                                             548
  In trouble and in grief, O God,                                     334
  In vain we thus recall to mind,                                     149
  I saw on earth another light,                                        91
  Israel's shepherd, guide us, feed us,                                58
  Is there a lone and dreary hour,                                    266
  Is this a fast for me,                                              387
  I thirst! O grant the waters pure,                                  236
  It is a faith sublime and sure,                                     356
  It is finished! glorious word,                                      136
  It is finished! Man of sorrows,                                     141
  It is the hour of prayer,                                           506
  It was no path of flowers,                                          142
  I want a principle within,                                          224
  I want the spirit of power within,                                  223
  Jesus shall reign where'er the sun,                                 176
  Jesus, we thy promise claim,                                        560
  Jesus, while he dwelt below,                                        452
  Jews were wrought to cruel madness,                                 135
  Joy! joy! a year is born,                                           389
  Joy to the world! the Lord is come,                                 110
  Launch thy bark, mariner,                                           431
  Leader of Israel's host, and guide,                                 270
  Lead us with Thy gentle sway,                                       502
  Let me not wander comfortless,                                      338
  Let the world despise and leave me,                                 536
  Lift your glad voices in triumph on high,                           137
  Light of life, seraphic fire,                                        21
  Like morning, when her early breeze,                                510
  Like shadows gliding o'er the plain,                                402
  Lo! God is here; let us adore,                                       13
  Lo! my shepherd's hand divine,                                      469
  Lord! before Thy presence come,                                      17
  Lord! deliver; Thou canst save,                                     581
  Lord! dismiss us with Thy blessing,                                  70
  Lord! from Thy blessed throne,                                      415
  Lord! have mercy when we pray,                                      204
  Lord! I believe a rest remains,                                     228
  Lord! I believe; Thy power I own,                                   207
  Lord! in heaven, Thy dwelling-place,                                 54
  Lord! in whose might the Saviour trod,                              117
  Lord Jesus, come! for here,                                         173
  Lord, lead the way the Saviour went,                                575
  Lord of the families below,                                         504
  Lord of the Sabbath, hear our vows,                                 373
  Lord of the wide-extended main,                                     572
  Lord of the worlds above,                                            16
  Lord of the world, who hast preserved,                              557
  Lord, once our faith in man no fear could move,                     420
  Lord! subdue our selfish will,                                      505
  Lord! Thou didst arise and say,                                     186
  Lord! Thy glory fills the heaven,                                    47
  Lord! what offering shall we bring,                                  11
  Lord! when Thine ancient people cried,                              438
  Lord! whom winds and seas obey,                                     570
  Lo! the lilies of the field,                                        267
  Love divine, all love excelling,                                      8
  Love on! love on! but not the things that own,                      298
  Lowly and solemn be,                                                344
  Many a power within earth's bosom,                                  432
  Mark the soft-falling snow,                                         169
  May freedom speed onward, wherever the blood,                       582
  Meet and right it is to sing,                                       497
  Men! whose boast it is that ye,                                     437
  Mighty God! the first, the last,                                     72
  Mighty One! whose name is holy,                                     414
  My dear Redeemer, and my Lord,                                      147
  My Father, when around me spread,                                   337
  My God! all nature owns Thy sway,                                    86
  My God! in life's most doubtful hour,                               531
  My God! in morning's radiant hour,                                   56
  My God, I thank Thee! may no thought,                               327
  My God, my Father, while I stray,                                   263
  My God, my strength, my hope,                                       225
  My God, permit me not to be,                                        221
  My soul, be on thy guard,                                           543
  My soul no more shall strive in vain,                               241
  Nature hath seasons of repose,                                      586
  Nay, tell us not of dangers dire,                                   309
  Nearer, my God, to Thee,                                            239
  No human eyes Thy face may see,                                      76
  No more, on earth no more,                                          352
  None loves me, Father, with Thy love,                               249
  Not in the name of pride,                                           155
  Not in this simple rite alone,                                      152
  Not only doth the voiceful day,                                      89
  Not that Thy boundless love, my God,                                275
  Not to the terrors of the Lord,                                     454
  Not with the flashing steel,                                        419
  Now from the altar of our hearts,                                   508
  Now gird your patient loins again,                                  451
  Now host with host assembling,                                      576
  Now let our voices join,                                            590
  Now that the sun is beaming bright,                                 365
  Now the shades of night are gone,                                   363
  O, Almighty God of love,                                            524
  O be not faithless! with the morn,                                  297
  O come and dwell in me,                                             517
  O, draw me, Father, after Thee,                                     222
  O'er silent field and lonely lawn,                                  461
  O'er the mount and through the moor,                                308
  O fairest born of love and light,                                   181
  Of all the thoughts of God that are,                                479
  O Father, humbly we repose,                                         250
  O Father, lift our souls above,                                      39
  O Father, though the anxious fear,                                    7
  O for a faith that will not shrink,                                 520
  O for a heart to praise my God,                                     518
  O from these visions dark and drear,                                208
  O give thanks to Him who made,                                      496
  O God, by whom the seed is given,                                    65
  O God! I thank Thee that the night,                                 366
  O God! the darkness roll away,                                      172
  O God! Thy children, gathered here,                                 384
  O God! to Thee our hearts would pay,                                401
  O God! to Thee who first hast given,                                243
  O God! we praise Thee, and confess,                                  50
  O God! who knowest how frail we are,                                 34
  O God, whose presence glows in all,                                  23
  Oh God, that mad'st the earth and sky,                              545
  O, he whom Jesus loved has truly spoken,                            578
  O, heaven is where no secret dread,                                 361
  O help us, Lord! each hour of need,                                 209
  O here, if ever, God of love,                                       158
  O holy Father, 'mid the calm,                                        26
  O, if thy brow serene and calm,                                     287
  O know ye not that ye,                                              280
  O let my trembling soul be still,                                   252
  O Lord! how happy should we be,                                     230
  O Lord! through Thee we own,                                        246
  O Lord! Thy heavenly grace impart,                                  242
  O Love! how cheering is thy ray,                                    233
  O lovely voices of the sky,                                         107
  On earth was darkness spread,                                       138
  One cup of healing oil and wine,                                    291
  One prayer I have, all prayers in one,                              521
  O, not alone on the mount of prayer,                                290
  O, not alone with outward sign,                                     198
  "O, not for these alone I pray,"                                    151
  O not to crush with abject fear,                                    122
  O not when the death-prayer is said,                                343
  On the dark wave of Galilee,                                        127
  On the dewy breath of even,                                         554
  Onward, Christian, though the region,                               313
  Onward speed thy conquering flight,                                 591
  Open, Lord, mine inward ear,                                         93
  Oppression shall not always reign,                                  190
  O pure Reformers! not in vain,                                      191
  O, richly, Father, have I been,                                     203
  O sacred head, now wounded,                                         562
  O say not, think not, heavenly notes,                               443
  O send me not away! for I would drink,                              202
  O source divine, and life of all,                                    75
  O speed thee, Christian, on thy way,                                316
  O spirit, freed from earth,                                         351
  O Spirit of the living God,                                         587
  O stay thy tears! for they are blest,                               346
  O still trust on, if in the heart,                                  299
  O suffering Friend of human kind,                                   129
  O Thou, at whose divine command,                                    486
  O Thou, at whose rebuke, the grave,                                 441
  O Thou from whom all goodness flows,                                211
  O Thou great Friend to all the sons of men,                         156
  O Thou great Spirit, who along,                                     500
  O Thou, in whom the weary find,                                     513
  O Thou, the primal fount of life and peace,                         477
  O Thou, to whom in ancient time,                                     81
  O Thou, who all things dost control,                                512
  O Thou, who driest the mourner's tear,                              475
  O Thou, who hast at Thy command,                                     38
  O Thou, who hast Thy servants taught,                               482
  O Thou, who in the garden's shade,                                  140
  O Thou, whose own vast temple stands,                               383
  O Thou, whose power o'er moving worlds presides,                    467
  O Thou, whose power stupendous,                                     388
  O Thou, whose presence went before,                                 435
  Our blest Redeemer, ere he breathed,                                193
  Our country is Immanuel's ground,                                   449
  Our Father, God! not face to face,                                  487
  Our Father, through the coming year,                                390
  Our Father! we thank Thee for sleep,                                460
  Our God is a spirit, and they who aright,                            20
  Our heavenly Father, hear,                                           28
  Our pathway oft is wet with tears,                                  331
  Out of the depths of woe,                                           547
  O what though our feet may not tread where Christ trod,             150
  O where are kings and empires now,                                  588
  O where shall rest be found,                                        227
  O who shall say he knows the folds,                                 283
  Part in peace! is day before us,                                     60
  Partners of a glorious hope,                                        561
  Peace of God, which knows no measure,                                61
  Pour, blessed Gospel, glorious news for man,                        177
  Pour forth the oil,--pour boldly forth,                             294
  Praise and thanks and cheerful love,                                391
  Praise the Lord, when blushing morning,                             393
  Praise the Lord, ye heavens adore Him,                               51
  Praise to God, immortal praise,                                     468
  Prayer is the soul's sincere desire,                                 99
  Prayer is to God the soul's sure way,                               100
  Press on, press on! ye sons of light,                               312
  Prisoners of hope, be strong, be bold,                              593
  Quiet from God! how beautiful to keep,                              282
  Quiet, Lord, my froward heart,                                      234
  Rejoice in God alway,                                               257
  Return, my soul, unto thy rest,                                     218
  Rise, my soul, and stretch thy wings,                               238
  Saviour, I my cross have taken,                                     272
  Scorn not the slightest word or deed,                               307
  "See how he loved," exclaimed the Jews,                             123
  See Israel's gentle shepherd stand,                                 445
  See the Lord, thy helper, stand,                                    253
  Send kindly light amid the encircling gloom,                        220
  Shall we grow weary in our watch,                                   278
  Shine on our souls, eternal God,                                     42
  Sing, ye redeemed of the Lord,                                      597
  Slavery and death the cup contains,                                 577
  Sleep not, soldier of the cross,                                    314
  Slowly, by God's hand unfurled,                                     371
  Songs of praise the angels sang,                                     48
  Sons of men, behold from far,                                       111
  Soul! celestial in thy birth,                                       197
  Source of light and life divine,                                    368
  Sow in the morn thy seed,                                           540
  Speak gently,--it is better far,                                    285
  Speak with us, Lord, Thyself reveal,                                522
  Spirit of peace and love and power,                                 599
  Suppliant, lo! Thy children bend,                                    15
  Supreme and universal Light,                                         44
  Supreme disposer of the heart,                                      538
  Sweet is the light of Sabbath eve,                                  462
  Sweet is the prayer whose holy stream,                              101
  Sweet morn! from countless cups of gold,                            362
  Teach me, my God and King,                                          302
  Teach us to pray,                                                    27
  Tell me not, in mournful numbers,                                   310
  Thanks, thanks unto God! who in mercy hath spoken,                  345
  Thanks to God for those who came,                                   166
  That blessed law of Thine,                                          229
  That might of faith, O Lord, bestow,                                526
  The aged sufferer waited long,                                      116
  The breaking waves dashed high,                                     478
  The bud will soon become a flower,                                  300
  The darkened sky, how thick it lowers,                              328
  The daylight is fading o'er earth and o'er ocean,                   552
  The dead are like the stars by day,                                 353
  The dove, let loose in Eastern skies,                               273
  The earth all light and loveliness,                                 395
  The fountain in its source,                                         240
  The glorious universe around,                                       585
  The heavenly spheres to Thee, O God,                                399
  The kings of old have shrine and tomb,                              427
  The land our fathers left to us,                                    436
  The light pours down from heaven,                                   458
  The Lord descended from above,                                      472
  The Lord is my Shepherd, no want shall I know,                      247
  The Lord our God is full of might,                                  573
  The mourners came, at break of day,                                 347
  The ocean looketh up to heaven,                                      85
  The offerings to Thy throne which rise,                              19
  The past is dark with sin and shame,                                187
  The peace which God bestows,                                        164
  There cometh o'er the spirit,                                       392
  There is a book, who runs may read,                                 476
  There is a state unknown, unseen,                                   357
  There is a world we have not seen,                                  450
  There's a strife we all must wage,                                  319
  There's nothing bright above, below,                                 83
  The saints on earth and those above,                                453
  The Spirit in our hearts,                                           194
  The spirits of the loved and the departed,                          354
  The uplifted eye and bended knee,                                   305
  The winds are hushed; the peaceful moon,                            474
  The world may change from old to new,                               274
  They who on the Lord rely,                                          248
  They who seek the throne of grace,                                   82
  Think gently of the erring one,                                     284
  Thirsting for a living spring,                                        5
  This child we dedicate to Thee,                                     377
  This world is not a fleeting show,                                  296
  Thou art gone to the grave; but we will not deplore thee,           409
  Thou art, O God, the life and light,                                 84
  Though lonely be thy path, fear not, for He,                        336
  Though wandering in a strange land,                                  88
  Thou givest Thy Sabbath, Lord! the din is stilled,                  485
  Thou hidden love of God, whose height,                              219
  Thou, infinite in love,                                             333
  Thou Lord of hosts, whose guiding hand,                             425
  Thou, Lord, who rear'st the mountain's height,                      303
  Thou most be born again,                                            200
  Thou seest my feebleness,                                           516
  Thou that art strong to comfort, look on me,                        330
  Thou, whose almighty word,                                          174
  Through all the various shifting scene,                             261
  Through all this life's eventful road,                               66
  Throughout the hours of darkness dim,                               559
  Through thee as we together came,                                   163
  Thus said Jesus, "Go and do,                                        292
  Thy bounteous hand with food can bless,                             492
  "Thy kingdom come," the heathen lands,                              171
  Thy presence, ever-living God,                                       67
  Thy servants in the temple watched,                                 589
  Thy servant's sandals, Lord, are wet,                               386
  Thy way is on the deep, O Lord,                                     332
  Thy will be done! in devious way,                                   265
  Thy will be done! I will not fear,                                  276
  'Tis my happiness below,                                            271
  'Tis not the gift, but 'tis the spirit,                             289
  "To God be glory! peace on earth!"                                  422
  To Him who children blest,                                          379
  To prayer, to prayer!--for the morning breaks,                        2
  To Thee, O God in heaven,                                           378
  To Thee, the Lord Almighty,                                         494
  To the Father's love we trust,                                      412
  To Thine eternal arms, O God,                                       205
  Triumphant Zion! lift thy head,                                     178
  Turn, child of doubt, estranged from God,                           196
  Turn not from him who asks of thee,                                 286
  Unchangeable, all-perfect Lord,                                      71
  Unto Thy temple, God of love,                                        10
  Up to the throne of God is borne,                                   369
  Wait on the Lord, ye heirs of hope,                                 529
  Was it in vain that Jesus prayed,                                   183
  Watchman, tell us of the night,                                     102
  We all, O Father, all are Thine,                                    251
  We bless Thee for this sacred day,                                  484
  Weep thou, O mourner, but in lamentation,                           340
  We follow, Lord, where Thou dost lead,                              563
  We join to pray, with wishes kind,                                  380
  We love the venerable house,                                        423
  We love this outward world,                                         339
  We pray for truth and peace,                                        525
  Westward, Lord, the world alluring,                                 418
  We wait in faith; in prayer we wait,                                595
  We will not weep; for God is standing by us,                        533
  We would leave, O God, to Thee,                                     324
  What precept, Jesus, is like thine,                                 442
  What shall we ask of God in prayer,                                  32
  When arise the thoughts of sin,                                     148
  When, blest Redeemer, thou art near,                                154
  When from the Jordan's gleaming wave,                               376
  When grief and anguish press me down,                               262
  When in silence o'er the deep,                                      568
  When in thine hour of conflict, Lord,                               215
  When Israel of the Lord beloved,                                     36
  When long the soul had slept in chains,                             574
  When on devotion's seraph wing,                                     359
  When my love to Christ grows weak,                                  144
  When the parting bosom bleeds,                                      571
  When thirst for power or for gold,                                  457
  When with error bewildered, our path becomes dreary,                212
  Where ancient forests widely spread,                                382
  Where for a thousand miles,                                         417
  Where is thy sting, O death,                                        349
  While shepherds watched their flocks by night,                      105
  While sounds of war are heard around,                               580
  While Thee I seek, protecting Power,                                 95
  While the stars unnumbered roll,                                    555
  While yet the youthful spirit bears,                                447
  Who is thy neighbor? he whom thou,                                  293
  Who shall behold the glorious day,                                  175
  Why, Thou never-setting Light,                                      210
  Wilt Thou not visit me,                                             237
  Within Thy courts have millions met,                                375
  With silence only as their benediction,                             342
  Wouldst thou in thy lonely hour,                                     92
  Yea! I will extol Thee,                                             549
  Ye joyous ones! upon whose brow,                                    446
  Ye servants of the Lord,                                            277
  Yes! prayer is strong, and God is good,                             206

                           I. PUBLIC WORSHIP.




1.                                S. M.                   *Emily Taylor.

                               Invitation.


  1   Come to the house of prayer,
      O ye afflicted, come!
    The God of peace shall meet you there,
      He makes that house His home.

  2   Come to the house of praise,
      Ye who are happy now;
    In sweet accord your voices raise,
      In kindred homage bow.

  3   Ye aged, hither come,
      For ye have felt His love;
    Soon shall ye lift a holier song
      In fairer courts above.

  4   Ye young, before His throne,
      Come, bow; your voices raise;
    Let not your hearts His praise disown,
      Who gives the power to praise.

  5   Thou, whose benignant eye
      In mercy looks on all;
    Who seest the tear of misery,
      And hear'st the mourner's call;

  6   Up to Thy dwelling-place
      Bear our frail spirits on,
    Till they outstrip time's tardy pace,
      And heaven on earth be won.




2.                                P. M.                         H. Ware.

                             Call to Prayer.


  1 To prayer, to prayer!--for the morning breaks,
    And earth in her Maker's smile awakes;
    His light is on all below and above,
    The light of gladness, and life, and love:
    O, then, on the breath of this early air,
    Send upward the incense of grateful prayer.

  2 To prayer!--for the day that God has blest
    Comes tranquilly on with its solemn rest;
    It speaks of creation's early bloom,--
    It speaks of the Prince who burst the tomb:
    Then summon the spirit's exalted powers,
    And devote to heaven the hallowed hours.

  3 Awake, awake, and gird up thy strength,
    To join Christ's holy band at length;
    To Him who unceasing love displays,
    Whom the powers of nature unceasingly praise;
    To Him thy heart and thy hours be given,
    For a life of prayer is the life of heaven.




3.                                S. M.                          *Watts.

                            Cheerful Worship.


  1   Come, ye who love the Lord!
      And let your joys be known;
    Join in a song with sweet accord,
      And thus surround His throne.

  2   The sorrows of the mind
      Be banished from this place!
    Religion never was designed
      To make our pleasures less.

  3   The sons of God have found
      That heaven begins below:
    Celestial fruits, on earthly ground,
      From faith and hope may grow.

  4   Then let our sorrows cease,
      And every tear be dry;
    We're travelling through the paths of peace
      To fairer worlds on high.

                            The House of God.


  1 Be still! be still! for all around,
    On either hand, is holy ground:
    Here in His house, the Lord to-day
    Will listen, while His people pray.

  2 Thou, tost upon the waves of care,
    Ready to sink with deep despair,
    Here ask relief, with heart sincere,
    And thou shalt find that God is here.

  3 Thou who hast laid within the grave
    Those whom thou hadst no power to save,
    Believe their spirits now are near,
    For angels wait while God is here.

  4 Thou who hast dear ones far away,
    In foreign lands, 'mid ocean's spray,
    Pray for them now, and dry the tear,
    And trust the God who listens here.

  5 Thou who art mourning o'er thy sin,
    Deploring guilt that reigns within,
    The God of peace is ever near;
    The troubled spirit meets Him here.

                              Seeking God.


  1 Thirsting for a living spring,
    Seeking for a higher home,
    Resting where our souls must cling,
    Trusting, hoping, Lord, we come.

  2 Glorious hopes our spirit fill,
    When we feel that Thou art near:
    Father! then our fears are still,
    Then the soul's bright end is clear.

  3 Life's hard conflict we would win,
    Read the meaning of life's frown;
    Change the thorn-bound wreath of sin
    For the spirit's starry crown.

  4 Make us beautiful within
    By Thy spirit's holy light:
    Guard us when our faith burns dim,
    Father of all love and might!




6.                                L. M.                           Heber.

                             The Sanctuary.


  1 Forth from the dark and stormy sky,
    Lord, to Thine altar's shade we fly;
    Forth from the world, its hope and fear,
    Father, we seek Thy shelter here:
    Weary and weak, Thy grace we pray;
    Turn not, O Lord! Thy guests away.

  2 Long have we roamed in want and pain,
    Long have we sought Thy rest in vain;
    Wildered in doubt, in darkness lost,
    Long have our souls been tempest-tost:
    Low at Thy feet our sins we lay;
    Turn not, O Lord! Thy guests away.

                        The Sabbath of the Soul.


  1 O Father, though the anxious fear
      May cloud to-morrow's way,
    No fear nor doubt shall enter here;
      All shall be Thine to-day.

  2 We will not bring divided hearts
      To worship at Thy shrine;
    But each unworthy thought departs,
      And leaves this temple Thine.

  3 Sleep, sleep to-day, tormenting cares,
      Of earth and folly born;
    Ye shall not dim the light that streams
      From this celestial morn.

  4 To-morrow will be time enough
      To feel your harsh control;
    Ye shall not violate this day,
      The sabbath of the soul.




8.                             8 & 7s. M.                      Wesleyan.

                              Love Divine.


  1 Love divine, all love excelling,
      Joy of heaven, to earth come down!
    Fix in us Thy humble dwelling,
      All Thy faithful mercies crown.
    Father! Thou art all compassion,
      Pure, unbounded love Thou art;
    Visit us with Thy salvation,
      Enter every longing heart.

  2 Breathe, O, breathe Thy loving spirit
      Into every troubled breast;
    Let us all in Thee inherit,
      Let us find Thy promised rest.
    Come, almighty to deliver,
      Let us all Thy life receive;
    Graciously come down, and never,
      Never more Thy temples leave!

                         Seeking God's Presence.


  1 Far from mortal cares retreating,
      Sordid hopes, and fond desires,
    Here our willing footsteps meeting,
      Every heart to heaven aspires.
    From the Fount of glory beaming,
      Light celestial cheers our eyes;
    Mercy from above proclaiming
      Peace and pardon from the skies.

  2 Who may share this great salvation?--
      Every pure and humble mind;
    Every kindred, tongue, and nation,
      From the dross of guilt refined:
    Blessings all around bestowing,
      God withholds His care from none;
    Grace and mercy ever flowing
      From the fountain of His throne.

  3 Every stain of guilt abhorring,
      Firm and bold in virtue's cause,
    Still Thy providence adoring,
      Faithful subjects to Thy laws,
    Lord! with favor still attend us,
      Bless us with Thy wondrous love;
    Thou, our sun and shield, defend us;
      All our hope is from above.




10.                               L. M.                         Gaskell.

                        "It is Good to be Here."


  1 Unto Thy temple, God of love,
    Once more we come with willing feet,
    To raise our thoughts this world above,
    And Thy paternal blessing meet.

  2 May all Thy purest presence feel,
    And silent keep each vain desire;
    With humble hearts before Thee kneel,
    And unto holier strength aspire.

  3 May all be bound in bonds more true
    To Thee, who art our life and light,
    That through each path which we pursue,
    We still may keep Thy love in sight.

  4 And may we, when the day shall close,
    Review its course without a fear;
    And, nearer heaven than when it rose,
    Feel it is good to have been here.




11.                              7s. M.                       J. Taylor.

                          Acceptable Offerings.


  1 Lord! what offering shall we bring,
    At Thine altars when we bow?
    Hearts, the pure, unsullied spring,
    Whence the kind affections flow:

  2 Willing hands, to lead the blind,
    Heal the wounded, feed the poor;
    Love, embracing all our kind,
    Charity, with liberal store.

  3 Teach us, O thou Heavenly King,
    Thus to show our grateful mind,
    Thus the accepted offering bring,
    Love to Thee and all mankind.

                          The Place of Prayer.


  1   Here, in this place of prayer,
      Father! Thy face we seek:
    Grant us that blessed peace to share,
      Known to the pure and meek.

  2   Come then to holy prayer,
      Souls that seem lost in night;
    Leave to the Lord your heavy care,
      Who giveth life and light.

  3   Come with a trusting prayer,
      Though fears press down your souls;
    The Saviour's promise, "I am there,"
      Each saddening fear controls.

  4   Here, in this place of prayer,
      Let hearts in union meet:
    Come, cast the load you cannot bear
      Low at the Saviour's feet.

  5   Then from this house of prayer
      Shall mingling praise be given,
    And angels, 'mid the holy air,
      Shall bear the notes to heaven.




13.                               L. M.                       Anonymous.

                     The Lord is in His Holy Temple.


  1 Lo! God is here; let us adore,
    And humbly bow before His face;
    Let all within us feel His power,
    Let all within us seek His peace.

  2 Lo! God is here; Him day and night
    United choirs of angels sing;
    To Him, enthroned above all height,
    Heaven's host their noblest praises bring.

  3 Being of beings! may our praise
    Thy courts with grateful incense fill:
    Still may we stand before thy face,
    Still hear and do thy sovereign will.

  4 More of Thy presence, Lord! impart;
    More of Thine image may we bear:
    O, fix Thy throne in every heart,
    And reign without a rival there.




14.                              7s. M.                         Bowring.

                               The Temple.


  1 In Thy courts let peace be found,
    Be Thy temple full of love;
    Here we tread on holy ground,
    All serene, around, above.

  2 While the knee in prayer is bent,
    While with praise the heart o'erflows,
    Tranquillize the turbulent!
    Give the weary one repose!

  3 Be the place for worship meet,
    Meet the worship for the place;
    Contemplation's blest retreat,
    Shrine of guilelessness and grace!

  4 As an infant knows its home,
    Lord! may we Thy temples know;
    Hither for instruction come,
    Hence by Thee instructed go.




15.                              7s. M.                            Gray.

                              Supplication.


  1 Suppliant, lo! Thy children bend,
    Father, for Thy blessing now;
    Thou canst teach us, guide, defend;
    We are weak, almighty Thou!

  2 With the peace Thy word imparts
    Be the taught and teacher blessed;
    In our lives, and in our hearts,
    Father! be Thy laws impressed.

  3 Pour into each longing mind,
    Light and knowledge from above:
    Charity for all mankind,
    Trusting faith, enduring love.




16.                               H. M.                          *Watts.

                    How Amiable are Thy Tabernacles.


  1 Lord of the worlds above,
    How pleasant and how fair
    The dwellings of Thy love,
    Thine earthly temples are!
        To Thine abode
        My heart aspires,
        With warm desires
        To see my God.

  2 The sparrow for her young
    With pleasure seeks a nest,
    And wandering swallows long
    To find their wonted rest:
        My spirit faints,
        With equal zeal
        To rise and dwell
        Among Thy saints.

  3 O happy souls that pray
    To Him that heareth prayer!
    O happy men that pay
    Their constant service there!

        They praise Thee still;
        And happy they
        Who love the way
        To Zion's hill.

  4 They go from strength to strength,
    Though oft through pain and tears,
    Till each arrives at length,
    Till each in heaven appears:
        O glorious seat!
        Our God and King
        Shall thither bring
        Our willing feet.

                                Devotion.


  1 Lord, before Thy presence come,
    Bow we down with holy fear;
    Call our erring footsteps home,
    Let us feel that Thou art near.

  2 Wandering thoughts and languid powers
    Come not where devotion kneels;
    Let the soul expand her stores,
    Glowing with the joy she feels.

  3 At the portals of Thine house,
    We resign our earth-born cares;
    Nobler thoughts our souls engross,
    Songs of praise and fervent prayers.




18.                               L. M.                           Watts.

                            Hundredth Psalm.


  1 Before Jehovah's awful throne,
    Ye nations bow with sacred joy;
    Know that the Lord is God alone;
    He can create, and He destroy.

  2 His sovereign power, without our aid,
    Gave life to clay, and formed us men;
    And when like wandering sheep we strayed,
    He brought us to His fold again.

  3 We are His people, we His care,
    Our souls and all our mortal frame:
    What lasting honors shall we rear,
    Almighty Maker, to Thy name?

  4 We'll crowd Thy gates with thankful songs;
    High as the heavens our voices raise;
    And earth, with her ten thousand tongues,
    Shall fill Thy courts with sounding praise.

  5 Wide as the world is Thy command,
    Vast as eternity Thy love,
    Firm as a rock Thy truth shall stand,
    When rolling years shall cease to move.

                          The Heart's Worship.


  1 The offerings to Thy throne which rise,
      Of mingled praise and prayer,
    Are but a worthless sacrifice,
      Unless the heart be there.

  2 Upon Thine all-discerning ear
      Let no vain words intrude;
    No tribute but the vow sincere,--
      The tribute of the good.

  3 Our offerings will indeed be blest,
      If sanctified by Thee;
    If Thy pure spirit touch the breast
      With its own purity.

  4 O, may that spirit warm each heart

  1 Our God is a spirit, and they who aright
      Would offer the worship He loveth,
    In the heart's holy temple will seek with delight
      The spirit the Father approveth.

  2 This, this is the worship the Saviour made known
      When she of Samaria found him
    By the Patriarch's well, sitting weary, alone,
      With the stillness of noontide around him.

  3 He having once entered hath shown us the way,
      O God! how to worship before Thee,
    Not with the vain forms of that earlier day,
      But in spirit and truth to adore Thee.

  1 Light of life, seraphic fire!
    Love divine, Thyself impart:
    Every fainting soul inspire;
    Enter every drooping heart:
    Every mournful spirit cheer,
    Scatter all our doubt and gloom;
    Father, in Thy grace appear,
    To Thy human temples come!

  2 Come in this accepted hour,
    Bring Thy heavenly kingdom in;
    Fill us with Thy glorious power,
    Rooting out the seeds of sin:
    Nothing more can we require,
    We can rest in nothing less:
    Be Thou all our heart's desire,
    All our joy and all our peace.

  1 Father! Thy paternal care
    Has my guardian been, my guide:
    Every hallowed wish and prayer
    Has Thy hand of love supplied:
    Thine is every thought of bliss,
    Left by hours and days gone by;
    Every hope Thine offspring is,
    Beaming from futurity.

  2 Every sun of splendid ray;
    Every moon that shines serene;
    Every morn that welcomes day;
    Every evening's twilight scene;
    Every hour which wisdom brings;
    Every incense at Thy shrine;
    These,--and all life's holiest things,
    And its fairest,--all are Thine.

  3 And for all, my hymns shall rise
    Daily to Thy gracious throne:
    Thither let my asking eyes
    Turn unwearied, righteous One!
    Through life's strange vicissitude
    There reposing all my care;
    Trusting still, through ill and good,
    Fixed, and cheered, and counselled there.

  1 O God, whose presence glows in all
    Within, around us, and above!
    Thy word we bless, Thy name we call,
    Whose word is Truth, whose name is Love.

  2 That truth be with the heart believed
    Of all who seek this sacred place;
    With power proclaimed, in peace received,
    Our spirit's light, Thy spirit's grace.

  3 That love its holy influence pour,
    To keep us meek, and make us free;
    And throw its binding blessing more
    Round each with all, and all with Thee.

  4 Send down its angel to our side;
    Send in its calm upon the breast;
    For we would know no other guide,
    And we can need no other rest.

  1 Great God! the followers of Thy Son,
    We bow before Thy mercy-seat,
    To worship Thee, the Holy One,
    And pour our wishes at Thy feet.

  2 O, grant Thy blessing here to-day!
    O, give Thy people joy and peace!
    The tokens of Thy love display,
    And favor, that shall never cease.

  3 We seek the truth which Jesus brought;
    His path of light we long to tread;
    Here be his holy doctrines taught,
    And here their purest influence shed.

    Our sins and errors be forgiven;
    And we, from day to day, be found
    Children of God, and heirs of heaven.

    How shall we all Thy love declare!
    The earth is veiled in shades of night,
    But heaven is open to our prayer,--
    That heaven, so bright with stars and suns,
    That glorious heaven which has no bound,
    Where the full tide of being runs,
    And life and beauty glow around.

  2 We would adore Thee, God sublime,
    Whose power and wisdom, love and grace,
    Are greater than the round of time,
    And wider than the bounds of space.
    Help us to praise Thee, Lord of light!
    Help us Thy boundless love declare;
    And, while we fill Thy courts to-night,
    Aid us, and hearken to our prayer.

    We would lift up our solemn psalm
    To praise Thy goodness, and Thy power
    For over us, and over all,
    Thy tender mercies still extend,
    Nor vainly shall Thy children call
    On Thee, our Father and our Friend!

  2 Kept by Thy goodness though the day,
    Thanksgiving to Thy name we pour;
    Night o'er us, with its stars,--we pray

    In darkness, guide; in sickness, cheer;
    Till, in the Saviour's righteousness,
    Before Thy throne our souls appear!

    A form of words will not suffice,
    The heart must bring its sacrifice:
        Teach us to pray!

    To whom shall we Thy children turn?
    Teach Thou the lesson we would learn,
        Teach us to pray!

    To Thee alone our hearts look up,
    Prayer is our only door of hope,
        Teach us to pray!

    Thy name be hallowed far and near,
      To Thee all nations bow.

  2   Thy kingdom come; Thy will
      On earth be done in love,
    As saints and seraphim fulfil
      Thy perfect law above.

  3   Our daily bread supply,
      While by Thy word we live;
    The guilt of our iniquity
      Forgive as we forgive.

  4   From dark temptation's power
      Our feeble hearts defend;
    Deliver in the evil hour,
      And guide us to the end.

  5   Thine, then, forever be
      Glory and power divine;
    The sceptre, throne, and majesty
      Of heaven and earth are Thine.

  1 God of all grace, we come to Thee,
      With humble, prayerful hearts;
    Give what Thine eye delights to see,
      Truth in the inward parts:

  2 Give deep humility; the sense
      Of holy sorrow give:
    A strong, desiring confidence,
      To hear Thy voice and live:

  3 Patience, to watch, and wait, and weep,
      Though mercy long delay;
    Courage, our fainting souls to keep,
      And trust Thee, though Thou slay.

  4 Give these,--and then Thy will be done!
      Thus strengthened with all might,
    We, in the spirit of Thy Son,
      Shall pray, and pray aright.

  2 Father of all our mercies,--Thou

    Hear us in heaven, Thy dwelling, now,
      And answer, and forgive.

  3 When harassed by ten thousand foes,
      Our helplessness we feel,
    O, give the weary soul repose,
      The wounded spirit heal!

  4 When dire temptations gather round,
      And threaten or allure,
    By storm or calm, in Thee be found
      A refuge strong and sure.

  5 When age advances, may we grow
      In faith, in hope, and love;
    And walk in holiness below

  1 Father, in Thy mysterious presence kneeling,
      Fain would our souls feel all Thy kindling love;
    For we are weak, and need some deep revealing
      Of Trust and Strength and Calmness from above.

  2 Lord, we have wandered forth through doubt and sorrow,
      And Thou hast made each step an onward one;
    And we will ever trust each unknown morrow,--
      Thou wilt sustain us till its work is done.

  3 In the heart's depths a peace serene and holy
      Abides, and when pain seems to have her will,
    Or we despair,--O, may that peace rise slowly,
      Stronger than agony, and we be still!

  4 Now, Father, now, in Thy dear presence kneeling,
      Our spirits yearn to feel Thy kindling love;
    Now make us strong, we need Thy deep revealing
      Of Trust and Strength and Calmness from above.

  2 Let not the choking cares of earth
    The precious springs of life o'ergrow;
    But, ever guarded by Thy love,
    Still purer may their waters flow.

    Be every day our spirits given;
    And may we, while we walk on earth,
    Walk more as citizens of heaven.

    By night, Arabia's crimsoned sands
    Returned the fiery column's glow.

  3 Thus present still, though now unseen,
    When brightly shines the prosperous day,
    Be thoughts of Thee a cloudy screen,
    To temper the deceitful ray!

    In shade and storm the frequent night,
    Be Thou, long-suffering, slow to wrath,

  2 Let heaven-eyed prudence be our guide;
      And when we go astray,
    Recall our feet from folly's paths
      To wisdom's better way.

  3 That heavenly wisdom from above
      Abundantly impart;
    And let it guard, and guide, and warm,

      Fountain of bliss and love!
    And all our darkness be dispersed

    And fixed on Thy sustaining arm,
    Find daily food and know no harm.

      In wisdom's pleasant ways!

  1 Supreme and universal Light!
    Fountain of reason! Judge of right!
    Parent of good! whose blessings flow
    On all above, and all below:

  2 Assist us, Lord, to act, to be,
    What nature and Thy laws decree;
    Worthy that intellectual flame,
    Which from Thy breathing spirit came.

  3 Our moral freedom to maintain,
    Bid passion serve, and reason reign,
    Self-poised and independent still
    On this world's varying good or ill.

  4 No slave to profit, shame, or fear,
    O, may our steadfast bosoms bear
    The stamp of heaven,--an upright heart,
    Above the mean disguise of art!

  5 May our expanded souls disclaim
    The narrow view, the selfish aim;
    But with a Christian zeal embrace
    Whate'er is friendly to our race.

  6 O Father! grace and virtue grant;
    No more we wish, no more we want:
    To know, to serve Thee, and to love,
    Is peace below,--is bliss above.

  1 Father, united by Thy grace,
      And each to each endeared,
    With confidence we seek Thy face,
      And know our prayer is heard.

  2 Touched by the loadstone of Thy love,
      Let all our hearts agree;
    And ever towards each other move,
      And ever move towards Thee.

  3 Grant this, and then from all below
      Insensibly remove!
    Our souls their change shall scarcely know,
      Made perfect first in love.

  4 To us the ministry be given,
      Which angels have above;
    For love can make on earth a heaven,
      And heaven is only love.

                          Prayer for Strength.


  1 Father, to us Thy children, humbly kneeling,
      Conscious of weakness, ignorance, sin and shame,
    Give such a force of holy thought and feeling,
      That we may live to glorify Thy name:

  2 That we may conquer base desire and passion
      That we may rise from selfish thought and will,
    O'ercome the world's allurement, threat, and fashion,
      Walk humbly, gently, leaning on Thee still.

  3 Let all Thy goodness by our minds be seen,
      Let all Thy mercy on our souls be sealed,
    Lord, if Thou wilt, Thy power can make us clean,
      O, speak the word! Thy servants shall be healed.

                              Thrice Holy.


  1 "Lord, Thy glory fills the heaven;
      Earth is with its fulness stored;
    Unto Thee be glory given,
      Holy, holy, holy Lord!"
    Heaven is still with anthems ringing;
      Earth takes up the angels' cry,
    "Holy, holy, holy," singing,
      "Lord of hosts, the Lord most High!"

  2 Ever thus in God's high praises,
      Brethren, let our tongues unite,
    Whilst our thoughts His greatness raises,
      And our love His gifts excite.
    With His seraph train before Him,
      With His holy church below,
    Thus unite we to adore Him,
      Bid we thus our anthem flow:--

  3 "Lord, Thy glory fills the heaven;
      Earth is with its fulness stored;
    Unto Thee be glory given,
      Holy, holy, holy Lord!
    Thus, Thy glorious name confessing,
      We adopt the angels' cry,
    'Holy, holy, holy,'--blessing
      Thee, the Lord our God most High!"

                            Songs of Praise.


  1 Songs of praise the angels sang,
    Heaven with hallelujahs rang,
    When, Creation's work begun,
    Spake the Lord, and it was done.

  2 Songs of praise awoke the morn,
    When the Prince of Peace was born;
    Songs of praise arose, when he
    Captive led captivity.

  3 Heaven and earth must pass away,
    Songs of praise shall crown that day;
    God will make new heavens and earth,
    Songs of praise shall hail their birth.

  4 And shall man alone be dumb,
    Till that glorious kingdom come?
    No; his heart delights to raise
    Psalms and hymns and songs of praise.

  5 Saints below, with heart and voice,
    Still in songs of praise rejoice,
    Learning here, by faith and love,
    Songs of praise to sing above.

  1 Holy, holy, holy Lord God Almighty!
      Early in the morning our song shall rise to Thee;
    Holy, holy, holy! merciful and mighty!
      All Thy works shall praise Thy name in earth, sky, and sea.

  2 Holy, holy, holy! all the saints adore Thee,
      Casting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea;
    Cherubim and seraphim falling down before Thee,
      Thou who wast, and art, and evermore shalt be!

  3 Holy, holy, holy! Though the darkness hide Thee,
      Though the eye of sinful man Thy glory may not see,
    Only Thou art holy, there is none beside Thee,
      Infinite in power, in love, and purity!

                                Te Deum.


  1 O God! we praise Thee, and confess
      That Thou the only Lord
    And everlasting Father art,
      By all the earth adored.

  2 To Thee all angels cry aloud;
      To Thee the powers on high,
    Both cherubim and seraphim,
      Continually do cry:

  3 "O holy, holy, holy Lord,
      Whom heavenly hosts obey,
    The world is with the glory filled
      Of Thy majestic sway."

  4 The apostles' glorious company,
      And prophets crowned with light,
    With all the martyrs' noble host,
      Thy constant praise recite.

  5 The holy church throughout the world,
      O Lord, confesses Thee,
    That Thou the Eternal Father art,
      Of boundless majesty.

                           Praise Ye the Lord.


  1 Praise the Lord! ye heavens adore Him!
      Praise Him, angels in the height;
    Sun and moon rejoice before Him;
      Praise Him, all ye stars of light!
    Praise the Lord, for He hath spoken;
      Worlds His mighty voice obeyed;
    Laws, which never can be broken,
      For their guidance He hath made.

  2 Praise the Lord! for He is glorious;
      Never shall His promise fail;
    God hath made His saints victorious,
      Sin and death shall not prevail:
    Praise the God of our salvation,
      Hosts on high His power proclaim;
    Heaven and earth, and all creation,
      Praise and magnify His name!

                              Glad Homage.


  1 Father of Spirits! humbly bent before Thee,
      Songs of glad homage unto Thee we bring;
    Touched by Thy spirit, O, teach us to adore Thee;
          Let Thy light attend us,
          Let Thy love befriend us,
      Father of our spirits, Everlasting King!

  2 Send forth Thy mandate, gather in the nations,
      Through the wide universe Thy name be known,
    Millions of voices shall join in adorations,
          Every soul invited,
          Every voice united,
      Joining to adore Thee, Everlasting One!

                              Glory to God.


  1 Glory be to God on high,
    God whose glory fills the sky!
    Peace on earth to man forgiven,
    Man, the well-beloved of heaven!

  2 Favored mortals, raise the song;
    Endless thanks to God belong;
    Hearts o'erflowing with His praise,
    Join the hymns your voices raise.

  3 Mark the wonders of His hand;
    Power, no empire can withstand;
    Wisdom, angels' glorious theme;
    Goodness, one eternal stream!

  4 Gracious Being! from Thy throne
    Send Thy promised blessings down;
    Let Thy light, Thy truth, Thy peace,
    Bid our selfish passions cease.

                              Lowly Praise.


  1 Lord, in heaven, Thy dwelling-place,
    Hear the praises of our race,
    And, while hearing, let Thy grace
    Dews of sweet forgiveness pour;
    While we know, benignant King,
    That the praises which we bring
    Are a feeble offering,
    Till Thy blessing makes it more.

  2 More of truth, and more of might,
    More of love, and more of light,
    More of reason, and of right
    From Thy pardoning grace be given!
    This can make the humblest song
    Sweet, acceptable, and strong,
    As the strains the angels' throng
    Pour around the throne of heaven.

    Blest are they Thou kindly keepest!
    God of stillness and of motion,
    Of the rainbow, and the ocean,
    Of the mountain, rock, and river,
    Blessed be Thy name forever!

  2 God of evening's peaceful ray!
    God of every dawning day,
    Rising from the distant sea
    Breathing of eternity;
    Thine the flaming sphere of light,
    Thine the darkness of the night!
    God of life, that fade shall never!
    Glory to Thy name forever!

  1 My God! in morning's radiant hour
    To Thee will I lift up my heart;
    The shades of night obey Thy power,
    And at Thy sun's bright beams depart.

  2 Father and Guardian! to Thy shrine
    The life Thou shieldest will I bring;
    All, great Creator! all is Thine;
    The heart my noblest offering!

  3 The morning light shall see my prayer,
    The noonday calm shall know my praise;
    And evening's still and fragrant air
    My grateful hymn to Thee shall raise.

  4 So shall sweet thoughts and hopes sublime
    My constant inspirations be;
    And every shifting scene of time
    Reflect, my God, a light from Thee!

    Glory for Thy spirit given,
    Guiding us in peace to heaven!

      Through our pilgrimage below,
    And beside the waters lead us,
      Where Thy flock rejoicing go.

      Meekly kneeling, we implore;
    We have found Thee, and would never,
      Never wander from Thee more.

  1 As every day Thy mercy spares
    Will bring its trials or its cares,
    O Father, till my life shall end,
    Be Thou my counsellor and friend!
    Teach me Thy statutes all divine,
    And let Thy will be always mine!

  2 When each day's scenes and labors close,
    And wearied nature seeks repose,
    With pardoning mercy, richly blest,
    Guard me, my Father, while I rest;
    And as each morning sun shall rise,
    O, lead me onward to the skies!

      Praise His name for life and light;
    Are the shadows lengthening o'er us?
      Bless His care who guards the night.

  2 Part in peace! with deep thanksgiving,
      Rendering, as we homeward tread,
    Gracious service to the living,
      Tranquil memory to the dead.

  3 Part in peace! such are the praises
      God, our Maker, loveth best;
    Such the worship that upraises
      Human hearts to heavenly rest.

  1 Guide us, Lord! while, hand in hand,
    Journeying toward the better land;
    Foes we know are to be met,
    Snares the pilgrim's path beset;
    Clouds upon the valley rest,
    Rough and dark the mountain's breast;
    And our home may not be gained,
    Save through trials well sustained.

  2 Guide us, while we onward move,
    Linked in closest bonds of love,
    Striving for the holy mind,
    And the soul from sense refined;
    That when life no longer burns,
    And the dust to dust returns,
    With the strength which Thou hast given
    We may rise to Thee and heaven.

  3 God of mercy! on Thee, all
    Humbly for Thy guidance call;
    Save us from the evil tongue,
    From the heart that thinketh wrong,
    From the sins, whate'er they be,
    That divide the soul from Thee.
    God of grace! on Thee we rest;
    Bless us, and we shall be blest.

    Eternal truth attends Thy word;
    Thy praise shall sound from shore to shore,

                              Go in Peace.


  1 Go in peace!--serene dismission
      To the loving heart made known,
    When it pours in deep contrition
      Prayer before the eternal throne.

  2 Go in peace! thy sins forgiven,
      Christ hath healed thee, set thee free
    Every spirit-fetter riven,
      Go in peace, and liberty!

  3 Saviour! breathe this benediction
      O'er our spirits while we pray;
    Let us part in sweet conviction
      Thou hast blessed our souls to-day.

  1 O God, by whom the seed is given,
      By whom the harvest blest;
    Whose word, like manna showered from heaven,
      Is planted in our breast;

  2 Preserve it from the passing feet,
      And plunderers of the air;
    The sultry sun's intenser heat,
      And weeds of worldly care!

  3 Though buried deep, or thinly strewn,
      Do Thou Thy grace supply;
    The hope, in earthly furrows sown,
      Shall ripen in the sky.

  1 Through all this life's eventful road,
    Fain would I walk with Thee, my God,
    And make Thy presence light around,
    And every step on holy ground.

  2 Each blessing would I trace to Thee,
    In every grief Thy mercy see;
    And through the paths of duty move,
    Conscious of Thine encircling love.

  3 And when the angel Death stands by,
    Be this my strength, that Thou art nigh;
    And this my joy, that I shall be
    With those who dwell in light with Thee.

  1 Thy presence, ever living God!
    Wide through all nature spreads abroad;
    Thy watchful eyes, which never sleep,
    In every place Thy children keep.

  2 While near each other we remain,
    Thou dost our lives and powers sustain;
    When separate, we rejoice to share
    Thy counsels, and Thy gracious care.

  3 To Thee we now commit our ways,
    And still implore Thy heavenly grace;
    Still cause Thy face on us to shine,
    And guard and guide us still as Thine.

  4 Give us within Thy house to raise
    Again united songs of praise;
    Or, if that joy no more be known,
    Give us to meet around Thy throne.

    Be with us through our pilgrimage,
      Conduct us to our rest.

  2 Through each perplexing path of life
      Our wandering footsteps guide;
    Give us each day our daily bread,
      And raiment fit provide.

  3 O, spread Thy sheltering wings around,
      Till all our wanderings cease,
    And at our Fathers loved abode
      Our souls arrive in peace.

  4 To Thee, our Father and our God,
      We our whole souls resign;
    And thankful own, that all we are
      And all we have is Thine.

    So the Lord is always nigh

  2 When they move at duty's call,
    He is with them by the way;
    He is ever with them all,
    Those who go and those who stay.

  3 From His holy mercy-seat
    Nothing can their souls confine;
    Still in spirit they may meet,
    And in sweet communion join.

  4 Father, hear our humble prayer!
    Tender Shepherd of Thy sheep,
    Let Thy mercy and Thy care
    All our souls in safety keep.

  5 In Thy strength may we be strong;
    Sanctify each cross and pain;
    Give us, if Thou wilt, ere long
    Here to meet in peace again.

  1 Lord! dismiss us with Thy blessing,
      Hope and comfort from above;
    Let us each, Thy peace possessing,
      Triumph in redeeming love:
          Still support us
    While in duty's path we move.

  2 Thanks we give, and adoration,
      For the gospel's joyful sound;
    May the fruits of Thy salvation
      In our hearts and lives abound;
          May Thy presence
    With us evermore be found!

  1 Unchangeable, all-perfect Lord!
    Essential life's unbounded sea!
    What lives and moves, lives by Thy word;
    It lives and moves and is, from Thee!
    Whate'er in earth, or sea, or sky,
    Or shuns, or meets, the wandering thought,
    Escapes, or strikes, the searching eye,
    By Thee was to existence brought.

  2 High is Thy power above all height,
    Whate'er Thy will decrees is done;
    Thy wisdom, holiness and might
    Can by no finite mind be known.
    What our dim eyes could never see,
    Is plain and naked in Thy sight;
    What thickest darkness veils, to Thee
    Shines clearly as the morning light;

  3 Thine, Lord, is holiness, alone:
    Justice and Truth before Thee stand:
    Yet, nearer to Thy sacred throne,
    Love ever dwells at Thy right hand.
    And to Thy love and ceaseless care,
    Father! this light, this breath, we owe;
    And all we have, and all we are
    From Thee, great Source of Life! doth flow.

  1 Mighty God! the first, the last!
    What are ages, in Thy sight,
    But as yesterday when past,
    Or a watch within the night?

  2 All that being ever knew,
    Far, far back, ere time had birth,
    Stands as clear within Thy view
    As the present things of earth.

  3 All that being e'er shall know
    On, still on, through farthest years,
    All eternity can show,
    Bright before Thee now appears.

  4 In Thine all-embracing sight,
    Every change its purpose meets,
    Every cloud floats into light,
    Every woe its glory greets.

  5 Whatsoe'er our lot may be,
    Calmly in this thought we'll rest,--
    Could we see as Thou dost see,
    We should choose it as the best.

  1 God is love; His mercy brightens
      All the path in which we move;
    Bliss He wakes, and woe He lightens;
      God is wisdom, God is love.

  2 Chance and change are busy ever;
      Man decays, and ages move;
    But His mercy waneth never;
      God is wisdom, God is love.

  3 E'en the hour that darkest seemeth
      Will His changeless goodness prove;
    From the gloom His brightness streameth;
      God is wisdom, God is love.

  4 He with earthly cares entwineth
      Hope and comfort from above;
    Everywhere His glory shineth;
      God is wisdom, God is love.

  1 I cannot always trace the way
    Where Thou, almighty One, dost move,
    But I can always, always say
        That God is love.

  2 When fear her chilling mantle throws
    O'er earth, my soul to heaven above,
    As to her native home, upsprings,
        For God is love.

  3 When mystery clouds my darkened path,
    I'll check my dread, my doubts reprove;
    In this my soul sweet comfort hath,
        That God is love.

  4 Yes, God is love;--a thought like this
    Can every gloomy thought remove,
    And turn all tears, all woes, to bliss,
        For God is love.

                          Love Supreme in God.


  1 O Source divine, and Life of all,
    The Fount of being's wondrous sea!
    Thy depth would every heart appall,
    That saw not Love supreme in Thee.

  2 We shrink before Thy vast abyss,
    Where worlds on worlds eternal brood;
    We know Thee truly but in this,
    That Thou bestowest all our good.

  3 And so, 'mid boundless time and space,
    O, grant us still in Thee to dwell,
    And through the ceaseless web to trace
    Thy presence working all things well!

  4 Nor let Thou life's delightful play
    Thy truth's transcendent vision hide;
    Nor strength and gladness lead astray
    From Thee, our nature's only guide.

  5 Bestow on every joyous thrill
    Thy deeper tone of reverent awe;
    Make pure Thy children's erring will,
    And teach their hearts to love Thy law!

                         God Known Through Love.


  1 No human eyes Thy face may see;
    No human thought Thy form may know;
    But all creation dwells in Thee,
    And Thy great life through all doth flow!

  2 And yet, O strange and wondrous thought!
    Thou art a God who hearest prayer,
    And every heart with sorrow fraught
    To seek Thy present aid may dare.

  3 And though most weak our efforts seem
    Into one creed these thoughts to bind,
    And vain the intellectual dream,
    To see and know the Eternal Mind,--

  4 Yet Thou wilt turn them not aside,
    Who cannot solve Thy life divine,
    But would give up all reason's pride
    To know their hearts approved by Thine.

  5 And Thine unceasing love gave birth
    To our dear Lord, Thy holy Son,
    Who left a perfect proof on earth,
    That Duty, Love, and Truth are one.

  6 So, though we faint on life's dark hill,
    And Thought grow weak, and Knowledge flee,
    Yet Faith shall teach us courage still,
    And Love shall guide us on to Thee!

  1 Father! there is no change to live with Thee;
    Save that in Christ I grow from day to day;
    In each new word I hear, each thing I see,
    I but rejoicing hasten on my way.

  2 The morning comes, with blushes overspread,
    And I, new-wakened, find a morn within;
    And in its modest dawn around me shed,
    Thou hear'st the prayer and the ascending hymn.

  3 Hour follows hour, the lengthening shades descend;
    Yet they could never reach as far as me.
    Did not Thy love its kind protection lend,
    That I, Thy child, might sleep in peace with Thee.

  1 Father, to Thy kind love we owe
    All that is fair and good below;
    Bestower of the health that lies
    On tearless cheeks and cheerful eyes!

  2 Giver of sunshine and of rain!
    Ripener of fruits on hill and plain!
    Fountain of light, that rayed afar,
    Fills the vast urns of sun and star!

  3 Who send'st Thy storms and frosts to bind
    The plagues that rise to waste mankind;
    Then breathest, o'er the naked scene,
    Spring gales, and life, and tender green.

  4 Yet deem we not that thus alone,
    Thy mercy and Thy love are shown;
    For we have learned, with higher praise,
    And holier names, to speak Thy ways.

  5 In woe's dark hour, our kindest stay!
    Sole trust when life shall pass away!
    Teacher of hopes that light the gloom
    Of death, and consecrate the tomb!

  1 Father! Thy wonders do not singly stand,
    Nor far removed where feet have seldom strayed;
    Around us ever lies the enchanted land,
    In marvels rich to Thine own sons displayed.

  2 In finding Thee are all things round us found!
    In losing Thee are all things lost beside!
    Ears have we, but in vain sweet voices sound,
    And to our eyes the vision is denied.

  3 Open our eyes that we that world may see!
    Open our ears that we Thy voice may hear!
    And in the spirit-land may ever be,
    And feel Thy presence with us always near;

  4 No more to wander 'mid the things of time,
    No more to suffer death or earthly change;
    But-with the Christian's joy and faith sublime,
    Through all Thy vast, eternal scenes to range.

  1 God, in the high and holy place,
      Looks down upon the spheres;
    Yet in His providence and grace
      To every eye appears.

  2 He bows the heavens; the mountains stand,
      A highway for our God:
    He walks amidst the desert-land;
      'Tis Eden where He trod.

  3 The forests in His strength rejoice;
      Hark! on the evening breeze,
    As once of old, the Lord God's voice
      Is heard among the trees.

  4 In every stream His bounty flows,
      Diffusing joy and wealth;
    In every breeze His Spirit blows,--
      The breath of life and health.

  5 His blessings fall in plenteous showers
      Upon the lap of earth,
    That teems with foliage, fruits, and flowers,
      And rings with infant mirth.

      Where sin and death abound,
    How beautiful beyond compare
      Will Paradise be found!

    The lyre of Hebrew bards was strung;
    Whom kings adored in songs sublime,
    And prophets praised with glowing tongue:

  2 Not now on Zion's height alone
    Thy favored worshippers may dwell;

    The grateful song, the fervent prayer,--
    The incense of the heart,--may rise

    And strength, and beauty, bend the knee;
    And childhood lisp, with reverent air,
    Its praises and its prayers to Thee!

  5 O Thou, to whom, in ancient time,
    The lyre of prophet bards was strung,
    To Thee, at last, in every clime,
    Shall temples rise, and praise be sung!

    But in its light my soul can see
    Some feature of the Deity.

  2 There's nothing dark, below, above,
    But in its gloom I trace Thy love,
    And meekly wait the moment when
    Thy touch shall make all bright again.

  3 The heavens, the earth, where'er I look,
    Shall be one pure and shining book,
    Where I may read, in words of flame,
    The glories of Thy wondrous name.

  1 Thou art, O God, the life and light
    Of all this wondrous world we see;
    Its glow by day, its smile by night,
    Are but reflections caught from Thee:
    Where'er we turn, Thy glories shine,
    And all things fair and bright are Thine.

  2 When day, with farewell beam, delays
    Among the opening clouds of even,
    And we can almost think we gaze
    Through golden vistas into heaven,
    Those hues that make the sun's decline
    So soft, so radiant, Lord, are Thine.

  3 When night, with wings of starry gloom,
    O'ershadows all the earth and skies,
    Like some dark, beauteous bird, whose plume
    Is sparkling with unnumbered eyes,
    That sacred gloom, those fires divine,
    So grand, so countless, Lord, are Thine.

  4 When youthful spring around us breathes,
    Thy spirit warms her fragrant sigh;
    And every flower the summer wreathes
    Is born beneath Thy kindling eye:
    Where'er we turn, Thy glories shine,
    And all things fair and bright are Thine.

      As 'twere a living thing;
    The homage of its waves is given,

  2 They kneel upon the sloping sand
      As bends the human knee;
    A beautiful and tireless band,
      The priesthood of the sea.

  3 The mists are lifted from the rills,
      Like the white wing of prayer;
    They kneel above the ancient hills,
      As doing homage there.

  4 The forest-tops are lowly cast
      O'er breezy hill and glen,
    As if a prayerful spirit passed
      On nature as on men.

  5 The sky is as a temple's arch:
      The blue and wavy air
    Is glorious with the spirit march
      Of messengers at prayer.

    When all Thy loved creation wakes,
    When morning, rich in lustre, breaks,
    And bathes in dew the opening flower,
    To Thee we owe her fragrant hour;
    And when she pours her choral song,
    Her melodies to Thee belong.

  2 Or when, in paler tints arrayed,
    The evening slowly spreads her shade,
    That soothing shade, that grateful gloom,
    Can, more than day's enlivening bloom,
    Still every fond and vain desire,
    And calmer, purer thoughts inspire;
    From earth the longing spirit free,
    And lead the softened heart to Thee.

  3 As o'er Thy work the seasons roll,
    And soothe, with change of bliss, the soul,
    O, never may their smiling train
    Pass o'er the human sense in vain!
    But, oft as on their charms we gaze,
    Attune the wondering soul to praise;
    And be the joys that most we prize
    The joys that from Thy favor rise!

    And when the tempest wildly raves.

  3 God on the lonely hills we meet,
    God, in the vale and fragrant grove,
    While birds and whispering winds repeat,
    That God is there,--the God of love.

  4 We meet Thee in the pensive hour
    When wearied nature sinks to rest;
    When dies the breeze, and sleeps the flower
    And peace is given to every breast.

  5 We see Thee when, at eve, afar
    We upward lift our wondering sight,
    We see Thee in each silent star
    That glorifies the gloom of night.

  6 But better still, and still more clear,
    Thee in Thy holy Son we see;
    There Thy own glorious words we hear,
    And learn the way to heaven and Thee.

    Before Thee bend the willing knee,
    From every star a choral hymn
    Goes up unceasingly to Thee.

  2 Day unto day doth utter speech,
    And night to night Thy voice makes known;
    Through all the earth, where thought may reach,
    Is heard the glad and solemn tone;
    And worlds, beyond the farthest star
    Whose light hath reached a human eye,
    Catch the high anthem from afar,
    That rolls along immensity.

    As if its inmost depths discerned
    The presence of a loftier power?

  2 Hast thou not heard 'mid forest glades,
    While ancient rivers murmured by,
    A voice from forth the eternal shades,
    That spake a present Deity?

  3 And as, upon the sacred page,
    Thine eye in rapt attention turned
    O'er records of a holier age,
    Hath not thy heart within thee burned?

  4 It was the voice of God that spake
    In silence to thy silent heart;
    And bade each worthier thought awake,
    And every dream of earth depart.

  5 Voice of our God, O, yet be near!
    In low, sweet accents, whisper peace;
    Direct us on our pathway here,

  1 I saw on earth another light
      Than that which lit my eye
    Come forth, as from my soul within,
      And from a higher sky.

  2 Its beams still shone unclouded on,
      When in the distant west
    The sun I once had known had sunk
      Forever to his rest.

  3 And on I walked, though dark the night,
      Nor rose his orb by day;
    As one to whom a surer guide
      Was pointing out the way.

  4 'Twas brighter far than noonday's beam,
      It shone from God within;
    And lit, as by a lamp from heaven,
      The world's dark track of sin.

                             Silent Worship.


  1 Wouldst thou in thy lonely hour
    Praises to the Eternal pour?
    I will teach thy soul to be
    Temple, hymn, and harmony.

  2 Sweeter songs than poets sing
    Thou shalt for thine offering bring;
    Softly murmured hymns, that dwell
    In devotion's deepest cell.

  3 Know that music's holiest strain
    Loves to linger, loves to reign,
    In that calm of quiet thought
    Which the passions trouble not.

  4 Wouldst thou in thy lonely hour
    Praises to the Eternal pour?
    Thus thy soul may learn to be
    Temple, hymn, and harmony.

                             Quiet Worship.


  1 Open, Lord, mine inward ear,
      And bid my heart rejoice;
    Bid my quiet spirit hear
      The comfort of Thy voice;
    Never in the whirlwind found,
    Or where earthquakes rock the place,
    Still and silent is the sound,
      The whisper of Thy grace.

  2 From the world of sin, and noise,
      And hurry, I withdraw;
    For the small and inward voice
      I wait with humble awe;
    Silent am I now and still,
    Will not in Thy presence move;
    To my waiting soul reveal
      The secret of Thy love!

  1 Far from the world, O Lord! I flee,
      From strife and tumult far;
    From scenes where sin is waging still
      Its most successful war.

  2 The calm retreat, the silent shade,
      With prayer and praise agree;
    And seem by Thy sweet bounty made,
      For those who follow Thee.

  3 There, if Thy presence cheer the soul,
      And grace her mean abode,
    O, with what peace, and joy, and love,
      She communes with her God!

  4 There, like the nightingale, she pours
      Her solitary lays;
    Nor asks a witness of her song,
      Nor thirsts for human praise.

  5 Author and Guardian of my life,
      Sweet source of light divine,
    And,--all harmonious names in one,--
      My Father! Thou art mine!

                           Habitual Devotion.


  1 While Thee I seek, protecting Power!
      Be my vain wishes stilled;
    And may this consecrated hour
      With better hopes be filled.

  2 Thy love the powers of thought bestowed;
      To Thee my thoughts would soar;
    Thy mercy o'er my life has flowed;
      That mercy I adore!

  3 In each event of life, how clear
      Thy ruling hand I see!
    Each blessing to my soul more dear,
      Because conferred by Thee.

  4 In every joy that crowns my days,
      In every pain I bear,
    My heart shall find delight in praise,
      Or seek relief in prayer.

  5 When gladness wings my favored hour,
      Thy love my thoughts shall fill;
    Resigned, when storms of sorrow lower,
      My soul shall meet Thy will.

  6 My lifted eye, without a tear,
      The gathering storm shall see;
    My steadfast heart shall know no fear;
      That heart shall rest on Thee!

                           The Heart's Prayer.


  1 As, down in the sunless retreats of the ocean,
      Sweet flowers are springing no mortal can see,
    So, deep in my soul, the still prayer of devotion,
      Unheard by the world, rises, silent, to Thee,
          My God! silent, to Thee,--
          Pure, warm, silent, to Thee.

  2 As still to the star of its worship, though clouded,
      The needle points faithfully o'er the dim sea,
    So, dark when I roam, in this wintry world shrouded,
      The hope of my spirit turns, trembling, to Thee,
          My God! trembling, to Thee,--
          True, sure, trembling, to Thee.




97.                            7 & 6s. M.                     Anonymous.

                          Pray Without Ceasing.


  1 Go when the morning shineth,
      Go when the noon is bright,
    Go when the eve declineth,
      Go in the hush of night;
    Go with pure mind and feeling,
      Put earthly thoughts away,
    And, in God's presence kneeling,
      Do thou in secret pray.

  2 Remember all who love thee,
      All who are loved by thee;
    Pray, too, for those who hate thee,
      If any such there be;
    Then for thyself, in meekness,
      A blessing humbly claim,
    And blend with each petition
      Thy great Redeemer's name.

  3 Or, if 'tis e'er denied thee
      In solitude to pray,
    Should holy thoughts come o'er thee
      When friends are round thy way,
    E'en then, the silent breathing
      Thy spirit lifts above
    Will reach His throne of glory,
      Where dwells eternal love.

  4 O, not a joy or blessing
      With this can we compare,--
    The grace our Father gives us
      To pour our souls in prayer:
    Whene'er thou pin'st in sadness,
      On Him who saveth, call!
    Remember, in thy gladness,
      His love who gave thee all.

                             All Must Pray.


  1 Child, amidst the flowers at play,
    While the red light fades away;
    Mother, with thine earnest eye,
    Ever following silently;

  2 Father, by the breeze of eve
    Called thy daily toil to leave;
    Pray! ere yet the dark hours be,
    Lift the heart, and bend the knee!

  3 Traveller in the stranger's land,
    Far from thine own household band;
    Mourner, haunted by the tone
    Of a voice from this world gone;

  4 Captive, in whose narrow cell
    Sunshine hath not leave to dwell;
    Sailor, on the darkening sea,
    Lift the heart, and bend the knee!

  5 Ye that triumph, ye that sigh,
    Kindred by one holy tie,
    Heaven's first star alike ye see;
    Lift the heart, and bend the knee!

                             What is Prayer?


  1 Prayer is the soul's sincere desire,
      Unuttered or expressed,
    The motion of a hidden fire,
      That trembles in the breast.

  2 Prayer is the burden of a sigh,
      The falling of a tear,
    The upward glancing of an eye,
      When none but God is near.

  3 Prayer is the simplest form of speech
      That infant lips can try;
    Prayer, the sublimest strains that reach
      The Majesty on high.

  4 Prayer is the Christian's vital breath,
      The Christian's native air,
    His watchword at the gates of death;
      He enters heaven with prayer.

  5 Prayer is the contrite sinner's voice
      Returning from his ways;
    While angels in their songs rejoice,
      And cry, "Behold, he prays!"

  6 In prayer, on earth, the saints are one;
      They're one in word and mind;
    When with the Father and the Son
      Sweet fellowship they find.

  7 O Thou by whom we come to God,
      The Life, the Truth, the Way,
    The path of prayer thyself hast trod;
      Lord, teach us how to pray!

                      Prayer the Life of the Soul.


  1 Prayer is to God the soul's sure way;
    So flows the grace he waits to give;
    Long as they live should Christians pray;
    They learn to pray when first they live.

  2 If pain afflict, or wrongs oppress,
    If cares distract, or fears dismay,
    If guilt deject, if sin distress,
    In every need, still watch and pray.

  3 'Tis prayer supports the soul that's weak,
    Though poor and broken be its word;
    Pray if thou canst, or canst not, speak;
    The breathings of the soul are heard.

  4 Depend on Him; thou shalt prevail;
    Make all thy wants and wishes known;
    Fear not, His mercy will not fail;
    Ask but in faith, it shall be done.

                             Silent Prayer.


  1 Sweet is the prayer whose holy stream
      In earnest pleading flows;
    Devotion dwells upon the theme,
      And warm and warmer glows.

  2 Faith grasps the blessing she desires,
      Hope points the upward gaze;
    And love, untrembling love, inspires
      The eloquence of praise.

  3 But sweeter far the still, small voice,
      Heard by no human ear,
    When God hath made the heart rejoice,
      And dried the bitter tear.

  4 Nor accents flow, nor words ascend;
      All utterance faileth there;
    But listening spirits comprehend,
      And God accepts the prayer.

  1 Watchman! tell us of the night,
      What its signs of promise are;
    Traveller! o'er yon mountain's height,
      See that glory-beaming star!
    Watchman! does its beauteous ray
      Aught of hope or joy foretell?
    Traveller! yes; it brings the day,
      Promised day of Israel!

  2 Watchman! tell us of the night,
      Higher yet the star ascends;
    Traveller! blessedness and light,
      Peace and truth, its course portends.
    Watchman! will its beams alone
      Gild the spot that gave them birth?
    Traveller! ages are its own;
      See, it bursts o'er all the earth.

  3 Watchman! tell us of the night,
      For the morning seems to dawn;
    Traveller! darkness takes its flight;
      Doubt and terror are withdrawn.
    Watchman! let thy wanderings cease;
      Hie thee to thy quiet home;
    Traveller! lo! the Prince of Peace,
      Lo! the Son of God, is come.

    The word of Jehovah he comes to fulfil,
    And o'er the dark world pour the splendor of day.

  2 Bring down the proud mountain, though towering to heaven,
    And be the low valley exalted on high;
    The rough path and crooked be made smooth and even,
    For, Zion! your King, your Redeemer, is nigh.

  3 The beams of salvation his progress illume,
    The lone, dreary wilderness sings of her God;

  1 Darkness o'er the world was brooding
      Sadder than Egyptian gloom;
    Souls by myriads lay in slumber
      Deep as of the sealed tomb.

  2 Earth had lost the links which bound it
      To the throne of light above;
    Yet an eye was watching o'er it,
      And that eye was full of love.

  3 Like a glorious beam of morning,
      Straight a ray pierced through the cloud,
    Spirits mightily awakening
      From their dark and heavy shroud.

  4 Still that ray shines on and brightens,
      Chasing mist and gloom away;
    Happy they on whom it gathers
      With its full and perfect day!

  1 While shepherds watched their flocks by night,
      All seated on the ground,
    The angel of the Lord came down,
      And glory shone around.

  2 "Fear not," said he,--for mighty dread
      Had seized their troubled mind,--
    "Glad tidings of great joy I bring
      To you and all mankind.

  3 "To you, in David's town, this day
      Is born, of David's line,
    The Saviour, who is Christ the Lord;
      And this shall be the sign:

  4 "The heavenly babe you there shall find
      To human view displayed,
    All meanly wrapped in swathing bands,
      And in a manger laid."

  5 Thus spake the seraph, and forthwith
      Appeared a shining throng
    Of angels, praising God, who thus
      Address their joyful song:

  6 "All glory be to God on high,
      And to the earth be peace!
    Good-will henceforth, from heaven to men,
      Begin and never cease!"

  1 Calm on the listening ear of night
      Come heaven's melodious strains,
    Where wild Judea stretches far
      Her silver-mantled plains!

  2 Celestial choirs from courts above
      Shed sacred glories there;
    And angels, with their sparkling lyres,
      Make music on the air.

  3 The answering hills of Palestine
      Send back the glad reply;
    And greet, from all their holy heights,
      The dayspring from on high.

  4 O'er the blue depths of Galilee
      There comes a holier calm,
    And Sharon waves, in solemn praise,
      Her silent groves of palm.

  5 "Glory to God!" the sounding skies
      Loud with their anthems ring,
    "Peace to the earth, good-will to men
      From heaven's Eternal King!"

  6 Light on thy hills, Jerusalem!
      The Saviour now is born!
    And bright on Bethlehem's joyous plains
      Breaks the first Christmas morn.

      Which hymned the Saviour's birth,
    Are ye not singing still on high,
      Ye that sang, "Peace on earth"?
      To us yet speak the strains,
      Wherewith, in time gone by,
      Ye blessed the Syrian swains,--
      O Voices of the sky!

  2 O clear and shining Light, whose beams,
      That hour, heaven's glory shed
    Around the palms, and o'er the streams,
      And on the shepherds' head!
      Be near, through life and death,
      As in that holiest night
      Of hope, and joy, and faith;
      O clear and shining Light!

  3 O Star which led to Him whose love
      Brought down man's ransom free!
    Where art thou?--'midst the host above
      May we still gaze on thee?
      In heaven thou art not set,
      Thy rays earth may not dim;
      Send them to guide us yet,
      O Star which led to Him!

  1 Brightest and best of the sons of the morning,
      Dawn on our darkness, and lend us thine aid!
    Star of the East, the horizon adorning,
      Guide where our infant Redeemer is laid!

  2 Say, shall we yield him, in costly devotion,
      Odors of Edom, and offerings divine?
    Gems of the mountain, and pearls of the ocean,
      Myrrh from the forest, or gold from the mine?

  3 Vainly we offer each costly oblation;
      Vainly with gifts would his favor secure:
    Richer by far is the heart's adoration;
      Dearer to God are the prayers of the poor.

      The Saviour promised long;
    Let every heart prepare a home,

  2 On him the Spirit, largely poured,
      Abides with holy fire;
    Wisdom and might, and zeal and love,
      His sacred breast inspire.

  3 He comes the prisoners to release,
      In wretched bondage held;
    The gates of brass before him burst,
      The iron fetters yield.

  4 He comes, the broken heart to bind,
      The bleeding soul to cure,
    And, with the treasures of his grace,
      Enrich the humble poor.

  5 Our glad hosannas, Prince of Peace!
      Thy welcome shall proclaim;

      Let men their songs employ;
    While fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plains
      Repeat the sounding joy.

  3 No more let sins and sorrows grow,
      Nor thorns infest the ground;
    He comes to make his blessings flow
      As far as sin is found.

  4 He rules the world with truth and grace,
      And makes the nations prove
    The glories of his righteousness,
      And wonders of his love.

    Piercing through the shades of death,

    Kindling darkness into light.

  3 Nations all, remote and near,
    Haste to see your Lord appear;
    Haste, for him your hearts prepare,

      His doctrine life imparts;
    O, may we feel its quickening power
      To warm and glad our hearts!

  5   Cheered by its beams, our souls
      Shall run the heavenly way;
    The path which Christ has marked and trod
      Will lead to endless day.

  1 As oft, with worn and weary feet,
    We tread earth's rugged pathway o'er,
    The thought how comforting and sweet,--
    Christ trod this very path before;
    Our wants, our weaknesses, he knows,
    From life's first dawning to its close.

  2 If we, beneath temptation's stress,
    Do fight against dark powers within,
    So, in Judea's wilderness,
    Christ wrestled with the thoughts of sin,
    When, in a weary, lonely hour,
    The tempter came with all his power.

  3 So, tried as I, this earth he trod,
    Knew every human ill but sin,
    And though the holiest Son of God,
    As I am now so hath he been;
    Jesus, my Saviour! look on me;
    For help and strength I turn to thee!

  1 Holy Son of God most high!
    Clothed in heavenly majesty,
    Many a miracle and sign,
    In thy Father's name divine,
    Manifested forth thy might
    In the chosen people's sight.

  2 But, O Saviour! not alone
    Thus thy glory was made known;
    With the mourner thou didst grieve,
    Every human want relieve;
    Far thy matchless power above
    Stands the witness of thy love.

  3 Thou, who by the open grave,
    Ere thy voice was raised to save,
    Didst with those fond sisters shed
    Tears above the faithful dead;
    Even thy word of might appears
    Less resistless than thy tears.

  4 Lord! it is not ours to gaze
    On thy works of ancient days;
    But thy love, unchanged and bright,
    More than all those works of might,
    More than miracle or sign,
    Makes us ever, ever thine.

  1 Fear was within the tossing bark,
      When stormy winds grew loud;
    And waves came rolling high and dark,
      And the tall mast was bowed.

  2 But the wind ceased,--it ceased,--a word
      Passed through the gloomy sky;
    The troubled billows knew their Lord,
      And sank beneath his eye.

  3 And slumber settled on the deep,
      And silence on the blast;
    They sank as flowers that fold to sleep
      When sultry day is past.

  4 O Thou that in its wildest hour
      Didst rule the tempest's mood,
    Send now thy Spirit forth in power
      O'er our dark souls to brood!

  5 Thou that didst bow the billows' pride,
      Thy mandate to fulfil,
    Speak, speak to passion's raging tide,
      Speak, and say, "Peace, be still!"

  1 The aged sufferer waited long
      Upon Bethesda's brink;
    Till hopes, once rising warm and strong,
      Began in fears to sink;
    And heavy were the sighs he drew,
      And fervent was his prayer,
    For he, with safety full in view,
      Still languished helpless there.

  2 His hope grew dim; but one was nigh
      Who saw the sufferer's grief;
    That gentle voice, that pitying eye,
      Gave promise of relief.
    Each pang that human weakness knows
      Obeyed that powerful word;
    He spake, and lo! the sick arose,
      Rejoicing in his Lord.

  3 Father of Jesus, when oppressed
      With grief and pain we lie,
    And, longing for Thy heavenly rest,
      Despair to look on high,
    O, may the Saviour's words of peace
      Within the wounded heart
    Bid every doubt and suffering cease,
      And strength and joy impart!

    And trusted in his Father's arm,
      Omnipotent to save;

  2 When darkly round our footsteps rise
      The floods and storms of life,
    Send Thou Thy Spirit down to still
      The dark and fearful strife.

  3 Strong in our trust, on Thee reposed,
      The ocean-path we'll dare,
    Though waves around us rage and foam,
      Since Thou art present there.

      Had round earth its mantle thrown,
    Holding intercourse with heaven:
      He was there alone.

      Made he to his Father known;
    In the spirit of devotion
      Musing there alone.

      Seek our God and Father's throne;
    And, to other scenes aspiring,
      Train our hearts, alone.

    And joy and reverence filled the place.

  2 From heaven he came, of heaven he spoke,
    To heaven he led his followers' way;
    Dark clouds of gloomy night he broke,
    Unveiling an immortal day.

  3 "Come wanderers, to my Father's home,
    Come, all ye weary ones, and rest!"
    Yes, sacred Teacher, we will come,
    Obey thee, love thee, and be blest.

  4 Decay, then, tenements of dust!
    Pillars of earthly pride, decay!
    A nobler mansion waits the just,
    And Jesus has prepared the way.

    Likeness to my Lord to find;

    May be, must be, formed in me.

  2 Since such griefs were thine to bear,
    For each sufferer thou couldst feel,
    Every mourner's burden share,
    Every wounded spirit heal.
    Saviour, let thy grace in me
    Form that mind which was in thee.

  3 When my pain is most intense,
    Let thy cross my lesson prove;
    Let me hear thee even thence;
    Breathing words of peace and love;
    Thus thy grace shall form in me
    The same mind which was in thee.

    Long hast borne the proud world's scorn,
    Long hast roamed the barren waste,
    Weary pilgrim! hither haste.

  3 Ye who, tossed on beds of pain,
    Seek for ease, and seek in vain;
    Ye whose swoln and sleepless eyes
    Watch to see the morning rise;

    In remorse for guilt who mourn,
    Here repose your heavy care;

      And God his Father know;
    And thus with love to raise up those
      That once were bowed low.

  2 O, not in coldness nor in pride
      His holy path he trod;
    'Twas his delight to turn aside
      And win the lost to God;
    And unto sorrowing guilt disclose
      The fount whence peace should flow;
    And thus with love to raise up those
      That once were bowed low.

  3 O, not with cold, unfeeling eye
      Did he the suffering view;
    Not on the other side pass by,
      And deem their tears untrue;
    'Twas joy to him to heal their woes,
      And heaven's sweet refuge show;
    And thus with love to raise up those
      That once were bowed low.

    Teaching the doctrine from the skies;
    Who bade disease and pain be gone,
    And called the sleeping dead to rise.

  3 See how he loved, who, firm yet mild,
    With patience bore the scoffing tongue;
    Though oft provoked, yet ne'er reviled,
    Nor did his greatest foe a wrong.

  4 See how he loved, who never shrank
    From toil or danger, pain or death;
    Who all the cup of sorrow drank,
    And meekly yielded up his breath.

    So pure, so made to live in light?
    O, who like thee did ever go
    So patient through a world of woe?

    The scorn, the scoffs, of men before?
    So meek, forgiving, godlike, high,
    So glorious in humility?

    The lisping infant clasp thy knee,
    And smile, as in a father's eye,
    Upon thy mild divinity.

  5 And death, which sets the prisoner free,
    Was pang and scoff and scorn to thee;
    Yet love through all thy torture glowed,
    And mercy with thy life-blood flowed.

  6 O, in thy light be mine to go,
    Illuming all my way of woe;
    And give me ever on the road
    To trace thy footsteps, Son of God!

    To the lone waste, the desert hill;
    And in the haunts of men he sought
    To do his Heavenly Father's will.

  3 He preached the gospel to the poor,
    Beside the couch of anguish stood,
    Consoled the sufferer, healed the sick,
    And went about still doing good.

  4 With sinners he conversed, and gave
    Peace to the weary, troubled mind;
    Yet free from stain till life's last hour,
    In him his foes no fault could find.

    All earth's temptations he withstood;
    And yet all human praise renounced,
    Declaring God alone is good.

    The weary and the heavy-laden rest;
          To bid the sinner live,
    And soothe our griefs to slumber on his breast.

  3       Let the birds seek their nest,

    Shall purify itself from every sin.

    Looked, through the lonely garden's shade,
      On that dread agony;
    He poured in prayer his suppliant breath,
    Bowed down with sorrow unto death.

  2 The sun went down in fearful hour;
      The heavens might well grow dim,
    When this mortality had power
      Thus to o'ershadow him;

    The very depths of human woe.

  3 He knew them all,--the doubt, the strife,
      The faint, perplexing dread;
    The mists that hang o'er parting life
      All darkened round his head;
    And the Deliverer knelt to pray;
    Yet passed it not, that cup, away.

  4 It passed not, though the stormy wave
      Had sunk beneath his tread;
    It passed not, though to him the grave

    Then his loving spirit rose
    More sublime than e'er before.

  2 He has taught us to forgive,
    By his words in days gone by;
    He has taught us how to live;
    Can he teach us how to die?
    Listen! as the cross they raise,
    One brief prayer ascends to heaven;
    For his murderers he prays,--
    Father, may they be forgiven!

  1 Jews were wrought to cruel madness,
    Christians fled in fear and sadness,
        Mary stood the cross beside.

  2 At its foot her foot she planted,
    By the dreadful scene undaunted,
        Till the gentle sufferer died.

  3 Poets oft have sung her story;
    Painters decked her brow with glory;
        Priests her name have deified;

  4 But no worship, song, or glory,
    Touches like that simple story,--
        "Mary stood the cross beside."

  5 And when under fierce oppression
    Goodness suffers like transgression,
        Christ again is crucified.

  6 But if love be there, true-hearted,
    By no grief or terror parted,
        Mary stands the cross beside.

  1 It is finished! glorious word
    From thy lips, our suffering Lord!
    Words of high, triumphant might,
    Ere thy spirit takes its flight.
    It is finished! all is o'er;
    Pain and scorn oppress no more.

  2 Now, no more foreboding dread
    Shades the path thy feet must tread;
    No more fear, lest in thine hour
    Pain should patience overpower;
    On the perfect sacrifice
    Not a stain of weakness lies.

  3 Champion! lay thine armor by;
    'Tis thine hour of victory!
    All thy toils are now o'erpast;
    Thou hast found thy rest at last;
    All hath faithfully been done,
    And the world's salvation won.

  1   Lift your glad voices in triumph on high,
      For Jesus hath risen, and man cannot die.
    Vain were the terrors that gathered around him,
    And short the dominion of death and the grave;
    He burst from the fetters of darkness that bound him,
    Resplendent in glory, to live and to save.
      Loud was the chorus of angels on high,--
      "The Saviour hath risen, and man shall not die."

  2   Glory to God, in full anthems of joy;
      The being he gave us death cannot destroy.
    Sad were the life we must part with to-morrow,
    If tears were our birthright, and death were our end;
    But Jesus hath cheered the dark valley of sorrow,
    And bade us, immortal, to heaven ascend.
      Lift, then, your voices in triumph on high,
      For Jesus hath risen, and man shall not die.

  1 On earth was darkness spread,
      One boundless night;
    "Let there be light," God said,--
      And there was light!

  2 There hung a deeper gloom
      O'er quick and dead,
    But Jesus burst the tomb,
      And darkness fled.

  3 God by His word arrayed
      Darkness with light;
    God by His Son displayed
      Day without night.

  4 For thee, O man, arose
      Creation's ray;
    For thee, too, brighter glows
      Salvation's day.

  5 The beams first poured on earth
      For mortals shone;
    The light of later birth
      Immortals own.

  1 According to thy gracious word,
      In meek humility,
    This will I do, my dying Lord,
      I will remember thee.

  2 Thy body, broken for my sake,
      My bread from heaven shall be;
    Thy testamental cup I take,
      And thus remember thee.

  3 Gethsemane can I forget?
      Or there thy conflict see,
    Thine agony and bloody sweat,
      And not remember thee?

  4 When to the cross I turn mine eyes,
      And rest on Calvary,
    O Lamb of God, my sacrifice!
      I must remember thee;--

  5 Remember thee, and all thy pains,
      And all thy love to me;
    Yea, while a breath, a pulse, remains,
      Will I remember thee.

    Didst wake thy weary ones again,
    Who slumbered at that fearful hour,
        Forgetful of thy pain,--

  2 Bend o'er us now, as over them,
    And set our sleep-bound spirits free,
    Nor leave us slumbering in the watch
        Our souls should keep with thee!

  1 "It is finished!" Man of sorrows!
    From thy cross our frailty borrows
        Strength to bear and conquer thus.

  2 While extended there we view thee,
    Mighty Sufferer! draw us to thee;
        Sufferer victorious!

  3 Not in vain for us uplifted,
    Man of sorrows, wonder-gifted!
        May that sacred emblem be;

  4 Lifted high amid the ages,
    Guide of heroes, saints, and sages,
        May it guide us still to thee!

  5 Still to thee! whose love unbounded
    Sorrow's depths for us has sounded,
        Perfected by conflicts sore.

  6 Honored be thy cross forever;
    Star, that points our high endeavor
        Whither thou hast gone before!

  1       It was no path of flowers,
          Which, through this world of ours,
    Beloved of the Father, thou didst tread;
          And shall we in dismay
          Shrink from the narrow way,
    When clouds and darkness are around it spread?

  2       O thou, who art our life,
          Be with us through the strife;
    Thy holy head by earth's fierce storms was bowed;
          Raise thou our eyes above,
          To see a Father's love
    Beam, like a bow of promise, through the cloud.

  3       And, O, if thoughts of gloom
          Should hover o'er the tomb,
    That light of love our guiding star shall be;
          Our spirits shall not dread
          The shadowy way to tread,
    Friend, Guardian, Saviour, which doth lead to thee.

  1 Go to dark Gethsemane,

    Watch with him one bitter hour;
    Turn not from his griefs away,
    Learn of Jesus Christ to pray!

  2 Follow to the judgment-hall,
    View the Lord of life arraigned;
    O the wormwood and the gall!
    O the griefs his soul sustained!
    Shun not suffering, shame, or loss;
    Learn of him to bear the cross!

  3 Calvary's mournful mountain climb;
    There, admiring at his feet,
    Mark that miracle of time,
    Love's own sacrifice complete;
    "It is finished," hear him cry;
    Learn of Jesus Christ to die!

  1 When my love to Christ grows weak,
    When for deeper faith I seek,
    Then in thought I go to thee,
    Garden of Gethsemane!

  2 There I walk amid the shades,
    While the lingering twilight fades,
    See that suffering, friendless One
    Weeping, praying there alone.

  3 When my love for Christ grows weak,
    When for stronger faith I seek,
    Hill of Calvary! I go
    To thy scenes of fear and woe;--

  4 There behold his agony,
    Suffered on the bitter tree;
    See his anguish, see his faith;
    Love triumphant still in death.

  5 Then to life I turn again,
    Learning all the worth of pain,
    Learning all the might that lies
    In a full self-sacrifice.

  1 In the cross of Christ we glory,
      Towering o'er the wrecks of time;
    All the light of sacred story
      Gathers round its head sublime.

  2 When the woes of life overtake us,
      Hopes deceive, and fears annoy;
    Never shall the cross forsake us,
      Lo! it glows with peace and joy!

  3 When the sun of bliss is beaming
      Light and love upon our way;
    From the cross the radiance streaming
      Adds more lustre to the day.

  4 Bane and blessing, pain and pleasure,
      By the cross are sanctified;
    Peace is there that knows no measure,
      Joys that through all time abide.

  1 If love, the noblest, purest, best,
    If truth, all other truth above,
    May claim return from every breast,
    O, surely Jesus claims our love!

  2 There's not a hope with comfort fraught,
    Triumphant over death and time,
    But Jesus mingles in that thought,
    Forerunner of our course sublime.

  3 His image meets us in the hour
    Of joy, and brightens every smile;
    We see him, when the tempests lower,
    Each terror soothe, each grief beguile.

  4 We see him in the daily round
    Of social duty, mild and meek;
    With him we tread the hallowed ground,
    Communion with our God to seek.

  5 We see his pitying, gentle eye,
    When lonely want appeals for aid;
    We hear him in the frequent sigh,
    That mourns the waste that sin has made.

  6 We meet him at the lowly tomb,
    And weep where Jesus wept before;
    And there, above the grave's dark gloom,
    We see him rise,--and weep no more.

    But in thy life the law appears
    Drawn out in living characters.

  2 Such was thy truth, and such thy zeal,
    Such deference to thy Father's will,
    Such love, and meekness so divine,
    I would transcribe, and make them mine.

  3 Cold mountains, and the midnight air,
    Witnessed the fervor of thy prayer;
    The desert thy temptations knew,
    Thy conflict, and thy victory too.

  4 Be thou my pattern; may I bear
    More of thy gracious image here;
    And, by the paths which thou hast trod,
    Press on to holiness and God.

    Duty's upward path we go;
    When, by toils and hardship pressed,

    Thou our Guide and Strength wilt be.

  3 When the way grows dark and drear,
    When, beset by doubt and fear,
    We can see no beam of light
    Struggling through the thickening night;

    Thou our Comforter wilt be.

      Insulted, and withstood,
    In hope and patience labor still
      To do our brethren good.

    Nor our knees press Gethsemane's garden of prayer!

  2 Yet, Loved of the Father! thy spirit is near
    To the meek and the lowly and penitent here;
    And the voice of thy love is the same, even now,
    As at Bethany's tomb, or on Olivet's brow.

  3 O, the Outward has gone, but in glory and power
    The Spirit surviveth the things of an hour;

    Though on his breast that moment lay
      The loved disciple's head;

  2 Though to his eye that moment sprung
      The kind, the pitying tear
    For those that eager round him hung,
      His words of love to hear.

  3 No, not for them alone he prayed;--
      For all of mortal race,
    Whene'er their fervent prayer is made,
      Where'er their dwelling-place.

  4 Sweet is the thought, when here we meet,
      His feast of love to share;

  1 Not in this simple rite alone
    May Calvary's cross to us be shown;
    But may we turn, in many an hour,
    To feel its soul-constraining power.

  2 When indolence would have its will,
    And selfish ease would keep us still,
    Then to the Saviour may we look,
    And meet his eye's serene rebuke.

  3 When men have done us cruel wrong,
    And angry thoughts are rising strong,
    May we with softened hearts turn there,
    And learn the Lord's forgiving prayer.

  4 When sin looks tempting in our eyes,
    May Jesus on the cross arise,
    And ask if we will him forsake,
    And wear the chains he died to break.

  5 When pain, or sickness, or distress,
    Our fainting souls would overpress,
    To him on Calvary looking still,
    May we find strength to bear God's will.

      Let strife and hatred cease;
    And every thought harmonious move,
      And every heart be peace.

  2 Not here, where met to think of him
      Whose latest thoughts were ours,
    Shall mortal passions come to dim
      The prayer devotion pours.

  3 No, gracious Master, not in vain
      Thy life of love hath been;
    The peace thou gav'st may yet remain,
      Though thou no more art seen.

  4 Thy kingdom come! we watch, we wait,
      To hear thy cheering call;
    When heaven shall ope its glorious gate,
      And God be all in all.

  1 "Come who will," the voice from heaven,
      Like a silver trumpet, calls;
    "Come who will,"--the church hath given
      Back the echo from its walls.

  2 Come, to rivers ever flowing
      From the high, eternal throne;
    Come, where God, his gifts bestowing,
      In the church on earth is known.

  3 Heavenly music! he who listens,
      Longing for his spirit's home,
    While his eye with rapture glistens,
      Yearning says,--"I come, I come!"

  1 Come unto me, when shadows darkly gather,
      When the sad heart is weary and distrest,
    Seeking for comfort from your Heavenly Father,
      Come unto me, and I will give you rest!

  2 Ye who have mourned when the spring-flowers were taken,
      When the ripe fruit fell richly to the ground,
    When the loved slept, in brighter homes to waken,
      Where their pale brows with spirit-wreaths are crowned;

  3 Large are the mansions in thy Father's dwelling,
      Glad are the homes that sorrows never dim;
    Sweet are the harps in holy music swelling,
      Soft are the tones which raise the heavenly hymn;

  4 There, like an Eden blossoming in gladness,
      Bloom the fair flowers the earth too rudely pressed;
    Come unto me, all ye who droop in sadness,
      Come unto me, and I will give you rest.

  1 Come to Jesus, O my brothers,
      Come in this accepted hour;
    Jesus ready stands to save you,
      Full of pity, love, and power;
          He is able,
    He is willing,--doubt no more.

  2 Let not conscience make you linger,
      Nor of fitness fondly dream;
    All the fitness he requireth
      Is to feel your need of him;
          This he gives you,--
    'Tis the spirit's struggling beam.

  3 Come, ye weary, heavy laden;
      Wait not,--'tis your Saviour's call;
    If you tarry till you're better,
      You will never come at all.
          Not the righteous,
    Sinners, Jesus came to call.

  1 Come, ye disconsolate, where'er ye languish;
      Come, at the shrine of God fervently kneel!
    Here bring your wounded hearts, here tell your anguish;
      Earth has no sorrow that heaven cannot heal.

  2 Joy of the desolate, light of the straying,
      Hope, when all others die, fadeless and pure,
    Here speaks the Comforter, in God's name saying,
      Earth has no sorrow that heaven cannot cure.

  3 Here see the bread of life; see waters flowing
      Forth from the throne of God, living and pure;
    Come to the feast of love; come, ever knowing
      Earth has no sorrow that heaven cannot cure.

  1 Through thee as we together came,
      In singleness of heart,
    And met, O Jesus! in thy name,
      So in thy name we part.

  2 Nearer to thee our spirits lead,
      And still thy love bestow,
    Till thou hast made us free indeed,
      And spotless, here below.

  3 When to the right or left we stray,
      Leave us not comfortless,
    But guide our feet into the way
      Of everlasting peace.

        Through him who died and rose,
    The peace the Father giveth through the Son,
        Be known in every mind,
        The broken heart to bind,
    And bless each traveller as he journeys on.

  2     Ye who have known to weep,
        Where your beloved sleep;
    Ye who have raised the deep, the bitter cry--
        God's blessing be as balm,
        The fevered heart to calm,
    And wondrous peace the troubled mind supply.

  3     Ere daily strifes begin
        The war without, within,
    The God of love, with spirit and with power,
        Now on each bended head
        His deepest blessing shed,
    And keep us all through every troubled hour.

                        The Heralds of the Cross.


  1 Forth went the heralds of the cross,
      No dangers made them pause;
    They counted all the world but loss,
      For their great Master's cause.

  2 Through looks of fire, and words of scorn,
      Serene their path they trod;
    And to the dreary dungeon borne,
      Sang praises unto God.

  3 Friends dropped the hand they clasped before,
      Love changed to cruel hate;
    And home to them was home no more;
      Yet mourned they not their fate.

  4 In all his dark and dread array,
      Death rose upon their sight;
    But calmly still they kept their way,
      And shrank not from the fight.

  5 They knew to whom their trust was given,
      They could not doubt His word;
    Before them beamed the light of heaven,
      The presence of their Lord.

  6 O, may a faith as true be ours,
      And shed as pure a light
    Of peace across the darkest hours,
      And make the last one bright!

  1 Thanks to God for those who came
    In the Saviour's glorious name;
    Who upon the green earth trod
    But to teach the truth of God.

  2 For the great Apostles, first,
    Who from life's endearments burst,
    Going from the Cross, and then
    Leading to the Cross again:

  3 For the next, who meekly poured
    Willing blood to serve the Lord;
    Fearless bore the racks of pain,
    Felon's death, or captive's chain;

  4 And for all, from shore to shore,
    Who the blessed tidings bore;
    All who wrought for liberty
    When 'twas treason to be free.

  5 Ye, who now, in better days,
    Live to spread your Maker's praise,
    Shedding, each man's home around,
    Light that consecrates the ground;

  6 Teachers of the word of light,
    Go forth in your Master's might!
    Speed your embassy where'er
    Life has grief, or death has fear!

    Who counted Christ their great reward,
      And yearned for him to die.

  3   They all, in life and death,
      With him, their Lord, in view,
    Learned from Thy holy spirit's breath
      To suffer and to do.

    May follow them in holiness,

    And gather in our sheaves with joy,

    To heaven, from whence it fell,
    It turns not back again;

        Through every pore,
        It calls forth all
        Her secret store.

  2 Arrayed in beauteous green,
    The hills and valleys shine,
    And man and beast are fed
    By providence divine:
        The harvest bows
        Its golden ears,
        The copious seed
        Of future years.

        And bear it down
        To millions more."

    In doubt and darkness calls for Thee;
    For Thou hast eyes to give the blind,
    And strength to set the captive free.

  3 Thy reign of peace and love begin!
    Too oft the Christian's sacred name
    Is stained by wrath and shamed by sin;

      Springing from eternal love,
    Well supply thy sons and daughters,
      And all fear of want remove.

  4 Who can faint while such a river
      Ever flows their thirst to assuage?
    Love, which, like the Lord, the giver,
      Never fails from age to age.

  5 Round each habitation hovering,
      See the cloud and fire appear!
    For a glory and a covering,
      Showing that the Lord is near:

  6 Thus deriving from their banner
      Light by night and shade by day,
    Safe they feed upon the manna
      Which he gives them when they pray.

                              Christianity.


  1 O fairest-born of Love and Light,
      Yet bending brow and eye severe
    On all which pains the holy sight,
      Or wounds the pure and perfect ear,--

  2 The generous feeling, pure and warm,
      Which owns the rights of all divine,
    The pitying heart, the helping arm,
      The prompt self-sacrifice, are thine!

  3 Beneath thy broad, impartial eye,
      How fade the lines of caste and birth!
    How equal in their sufferings lie
      The groaning multitudes of earth!

  4 Still to a stricken brother true,
      Whatever clime hath nurtured him;
    As stooped to heal the wounded Jew
      The worshipper of Gerizim.

  5 In holy words which cannot die,
      In thoughts which angels leaned to know,
    Christ gave thy message from on high,
      Thy mission to a world of woe.

  6 That voice's echo hath not died;
      From the blue lake of Galilee,
    From Tabor's lonely mountain-side,
      It calls a struggling world to thee.

                           Christian Equality.


  1 All men are equal in their birth,
      Heirs of the earth and skies;
    All men are equal, when that earth
      Fails from their dying eyes.

  2 God greets the throngs who pay their vows
      In courts their hands have made;
    And hears the worshipper who bows
      Beneath the plantain shade.

  3 'Tis man alone who difference sees,
      And speaks of high and low;
    And worships those, and tramples these,
      While the same path they go.

  4 O, let man hasten to restore
      To all their rights of love!
    In power and wealth exult no more,
      In wisdom lowly move.

  5 Ye great! renounce your earth-born pride;
      Ye low! your shame and fear;
    Live, as ye worship, side by side;
      Your brotherhood revere.

  1 Was it in vain that Jesus prayed
      For those he came to save,
    When darkly o'er his path was laid
      The shadow of the grave?

  2 Hath Jesus loved and prayed in vain?
      O doubting heart, be still!
    Yet holds the Lord his glorious reign,
      Despite of wrong and ill.

  3 Though nations with their battle-cries
      Profane the Almighty's name,
    Though bigots to the offended skies
      Their own wild wrath proclaim,--

  4 Thousands, in every Christian land,
      Have never bowed the knee
    In worship to the idol-band
      Of strife and perfidy.

  5 And these are one;--though some may bend
      Before the Virgin's shrine,
    While others' prayers and thanks ascend,
      Father! alone at Thine,--

  6 Yet they are one; if through their hearts
      The soul of love be poured,
    As swells some strain of various parts,
      Yet all in sweet accord.

    Why should the earth be drenched with gore?
      Are we not brothers all?

  2   Want, from the wretch depart!
      Chains, from the captive fall!
    Sweet mercy, melt the oppressor's heart,--
      Sufferers are brothers all.

  3   Churches and sects, strike down
      Each mean partition-wall!
    Let love each harsher feeling drown,--
      Christians are brothers all.

  4   Let love and truth alone
      Hold human hearts in thrall,
    That heaven its work at length may own,
      And men be brothers all.

  1 How long, O Lord, his brother's blood
      Shall man in battle spill?
    How long that mandate be withstood,
      Which cries, "Thou shalt not kill?"

  2 How long shall glory still be found
      In scenes of cruel strife,
    Where misery walks, a giant crowned,
      Crushing the flowers of life?

  3 O, hush, great God! the sounds of war,
      And make Thy children feel
    That he, with Thee, is noblest far,
      Who toils for human weal;--

  4 And though forgotten, he alone
      Can be a Christian true
    Who would his foes as brethren own,
      And still their good pursue.

  1 Lord! thou didst arise and say
    To the troubled waters, Peace!
    And the tempest died away;
    Down they sank, the foaming seas,
    And a calm and heaving sleep
    Spread o'er all the glassy deep;
    All the azure lake serene
    Like another heaven was seen.

  2 Lord! thy gracious word repeat
    To the billows of the proud!
    Quell the tyrant's martial heat,
    Quell the fierce and changing crowd!
    Then the earth shall find repose
    From oppressions, and from woes;
    And an imaged heaven appear
    In the world of darkness here.

  1 The Past is dark with sin and shame,
    The Future dim with doubt and fear;
    But, Father, yet we praise Thy name,
    Whose guardian love is always near.

  2 For man has striven, ages long,
    With faltering steps to come to Thee,
    And in each purpose high and strong
    The influence of Thy grace could see.

  3 He could not breathe an earnest prayer,
    But Thou wast kinder than he dreamed,
    As age by age brought hopes more fair,
    And nearer still Thy kingdom seemed.

  4 But never rose within his breast
    A trust so calm and deep as now;--
    Shall not the weary find a rest?
    Father, Preserver, answer Thou!

  5 'Tis dark around, 'tis dark above,
    But through the shadow streams the sun;
    We cannot doubt Thy certain love;
    And Man's true aim shall yet be won!

    Herald of freedom's birth,
    There comes a glorious cry.

  2 The triple chains that bind
    Fall from the weary limb,
    And from the down-crushed mind,
    As soundeth that high hymn.

  3 Unto man's waiting heart
    It saith,--"Arise, be strong!
    Bear thou an earnest part
    Against all forms of wrong.

    Be every word of hate
    Forever hushed in peace."

  7 Sound, sound through all the earth!
    Sound through the echoing sky!
    Proclaim the world's new birth;
    Proclaim the Lord is nigh!

  1 God made all his creatures free;
    Life itself is liberty;
    God ordained no other bands

  2 Sin the primal charter broke,--

    Tyranny with sin began,
    Man o'er brute, and man o'er man.

  3 But a better day shall be,
    Life again be liberty,
    And the wide world's only bands
    Love-knit hearts and love-linked hands.

  4 So shall every slavery cease,
    All God's children dwell in peace,
    And the new-born earth record
    Love, and Love alone, is Lord.

  1 Oppression shall not always reign;
      There comes a brighter day,
    When freedom, burst from every chain,
      Shall have triumphant way.
    Then right shall over might prevail,
    And truth, like hero armed in mail,
    The hosts of tyrant wrong assail,
      And hold eternal sway.

  2 What voice shall bid the progress stay
      Of truth's victorious car?
    What arm arrest the growing day,
      Or quench the solar star?
    What reckless soul, though stout and strong,
    Shall dare bring back the ancient wrong,
    Oppression's guilty night prolong,
      And freedom's morning bar?

      Your peaceful zeal shall find.

  2 The truths ye urge are borne abroad
      By every wind and tide;
    The voice of nature and of God
      Speaks out upon your side.

      Are those which Heaven hath wrought,
    Light, Truth, and Love,--your battle-ground,

  4 O, may no selfish purpose break
      The beauty of your plan,
    Nor lie from throne or altar shake
      Your steady faith in man.

  5 Press on! and if we may not share
      The glory of your fight,
    We'll ask at least, in earnest prayer,
      God's blessing on the Right.

      Shall no more perplex your ways;
    You shall name your walls salvation,
      And your gates shall all be praise.

  2 There, in undisturbed possession,
      Peace and righteousness shall reign;
    Never shall you feel oppression,
      Never hear of war again;
    God shall rise, and, shining o'er you,
      Change to day the gloom of night;
    He, the Lord, shall be your glory,
      God your everlasting light.

    A Guide, a Comforter, bequeathed,
          With us to dwell.

  2 He came, in tongues of living flame,
      To teach, convince, subdue;
    All powerful as the wind he came,
          As viewless too.

  3 He came sweet influence to impart,
      A gracious, willing guest,
    While he can find one humble heart
          Wherein to rest.

  4 And his that gentle voice we hear,
      Soft as the breath of even,
    That checks each fault, that calms each fear
          And speaks of heaven.

  5 And every virtue we possess,
      And every victory won,
    And every thought of holiness,
          Are his alone.

  6 Spirit of purity and grace,
      Our weakness pitying see;
    O, make our hearts Thy dwelling-place,
          And worthier Thee!

  2 Hast thou wasted all the powers
    God for noble uses gave?
    Squandered life's most golden hours?
    Turn thee, brother, God can save!

  3 Is a mighty famine now
    In thy heart and in thy soul?
    Discontent upon thy brow?
    Turn thee, God will make thee whole!

    The shade of death,--the maze of woe!
    There is a path that leads to rest,
    A fount of life is given below.

  3 Thy friend, thy Lord, from heaven revealed,
    The lost, the erring, to recall,
    That sacred fountain hath unsealed;
    With voice of love he speaks to all.

    To walk in duty's way, and live;
    He speaks to wounded souls that mourn,
    He speaks,--to heal and to forgive.

    The message of a truth divine,
      The call of God, is given;
    Awakening in the human heart
      Love for the True and Right,
    Zeal for the Christian's better part,
      Strength for the Christian's fight.

  2  Though heralded by naught of fear,
      Or outward sign, or show;
    Though only to the inward ear
      It whisper soft and low;
    Though dropping as the manna fell,
      Unseen, yet from above,
    Holy and gentle, heed it well,--
      The call to Truth and Love.

    And sleep, like an angel, shall visit thy bed.

  2 Acquaint thee, O spirit, acquaint thee with God,

    Thy safeguard in danger that threatens thy path,
    Thy joy in the valley and shadow of death.

  2   Thou must be born again!
      But not the birth of clay;
    The immortal seed must thence obtain
      Deliverance into day.

  3   Thou, in thy inmost mind,
      Must own the same control;
    The same regenerating wind
      Must move and guide thy soul.

  4   Thou canst not choose but trace
      The steps the Master trod,
    If once thou feel his truth and grace,
      A conscious child of God.

  5   The mortal's birth is past;
      The immortal's birth must be;
    Seek well and thou shalt find at last
      That blest nativity.

  1 God of mercy! God of love!
    Hear our sad, repentant songs;
    Listen to Thy suppliant ones,
    Thou, to whom all grace belongs!

  2 Deep regret for follies past,
    Talents wasted, time misspent;
    Hearts debased by worldly cares,
    Thankless for the blessings lent;--

  3 Foolish fears and fond desires,
    Vain regrets for things as vain;
    Lips too seldom taught to praise,
    Oft to murmur and complain;--

    Even I, the weakest, at the fount of life;
    Chide not my steps, that venture near the brink,
    Weary and fainting from the deadly strife.

  2 Went I not forth undaunted and alone,
    Strong in the majesty of human might?
    Lo! I return, all wounded and forlorn,
    My dream of glory lost in shades of night.

    Bore I not helm of pride and glittering sword?
    Behold the fragments of my broken shield,
    And lend to me Thy heavenly armor, Lord!

                            The Penitent Son.


  1 O, richly, Father, have I been
      Blest evermore by Thee!
    And morning, noon, and night Thou hast
      Preserved me tenderly.

  2 And yet the love which Thou shouldst claim
      To idols I have given;
    Too oft have bound to earth the hopes
      That know no home but heaven.

  3 Unworthy to be called Thy son,
      I come with shame to Thee,
    Father!--O, more than Father, Thou
      Hast always been to me!

  4 Help me to break the heavy chains
      The world has round me thrown,
    And know the glorious liberty
      Of an obedient son.

  5 That I may henceforth heed whate'er
      Thy voice within me saith,
    Fix deeply in my heart of hearts
      A principle of faith,--

  6 Faith that, like armor to my soul,
      Shall keep all evil out,
    More mighty than an angel host,
      Encamping round about.

  1 Lord, have mercy when we pray
    Strength to seek a better way;
    When our wakening thoughts begin
    First to loathe their cherished sin;
    When our weary spirits fail,
    And our aching brows are pale;
    Then Thy strengthening grace afford;
    Then, O, then, have mercy, Lord!

  2 Lord, have mercy when we know
    First how vain this world below;
    When its darker thoughts oppress,
    Doubts perplex, and fears distress;
    When the earliest gleam is given
    Of the bright but distant heaven;
    Then Thy strengthening grace afford;
    Then, O, then, have mercy, Lord!

  1 To Thine eternal arms, O God,
    Take us, Thine erring children, in;
    From dangerous paths too boldly trod,
    From wandering thoughts and dreams of sin.

  2 Those arms were round our childish ways,
    A guard through helpless years to be;
    O leave not our maturer days,
    We still are helpless without Thee!

  3 We trusted hope and pride and strength:
    Our strength proved false, our pride was vain,
    Our dreams have faded all at length,--
    We come to Thee, O Lord, again!

  4 A guide to trembling steps yet be!
    Give us of Thine eternal powers!
    So shall our paths all lead to Thee,
    And life smile on like childhood's hours.

  1 Yes! prayer is strong, and God is good;
    Man is not made for endless ill;
    The offending soul, in darkest mood,
    Hath yet a hope, a refuge still.

  2 Thou, God, wilt hear; these pangs are meant
    To heal the spirit, not destroy;
    And even remorse, for chastening sent,
    When Thou commandest, works for joy.

  1 Lord! I believe; Thy power I own
      Thy word I would obey;
    I wander comfortless and lone,
      When from Thy truth I stray.

  2 Lord! I believe; but gloomy fears
      Sometimes bedim my sight;
    I look to Thee with prayers and tears,
      And cry for strength and light.

  3 Lord! I believe; but oft, I know,
      My faith is cold and weak;
    Make strong my weakness, and bestow
      The confidence I seek!

  4 Yes, I believe; and only Thou
      Canst give my soul relief;
    Lord! to Thy truth my spirit bow,
      Help Thou my unbelief!

  1 O, from these visions dark and drear,
      Kind Father, set me free;
    I struggle yet with darkness here,--
      My God, remember me!

  2 Refresh my drooping soul with grace
      And quickening energy;
    Still running, toiling in the race,--
      My God, remember me!

  3 Some cheering ray of hope impart,
      Sweet influence from Thee;
    And raise this feeble, drooping heart,--
      My God, remember me!

  4 For the inheritance in light,
      On trembling wings I flee;
    With sins, and doubts, and fears, I fight,--
      My God, remember me!

  1 O, help us, Lord! each hour of need
      Thy heavenly succor give;
    Help us in thought, in word, in deed,
      Each hour on earth we live.

  2 O, help us, when our spirits bleed,
      With doubt and anguish sore;
    And when our hearts are cold and dead,
      O, help us, Lord, the more.

  3 O, help us, through the prayer of faith,
      More firmly to believe;
    For still the more the servant hath,
      The more shall he receive.

  4 O, help us, Father! from on high;
      We know no help but Thee;
    O, help us so to live and die,
      As Thine in heaven to be!

    Light my dark and erring way

    Be this the prayer of my last breath,--

      And lift my soul to Thee,
    Then, with the saints at Thy right hand,
      Good Lord, remember me!

  1 When, with error bewildered, our path becomes dreary,
      And tears of despondency flow,
    When the whole head is sick, and the whole heart is weary,
      Despairing,--to whom shall we go?

  2 When the thirsting soul turneth away from the springs
      Of the pleasures this world can bestow,
    And sighs for another, and flutters its wings,
      Impatient,--to whom shall it go?

  3 O, blest be that light which has parted the clouds,
      And a path to the wanderer can show;
    That pierces the veil which the future enshrouds,
      And tells us to whom we should go!

                         Help Thou Our Unbelief.


  1 Father, when o'er our trembling hearts
      Doubt's shadows gathering brood,
    When faith in Thee almost departs,
      And gloomiest fears intrude;
    Forsake us not, O God of grace,
      But send those fears relief;
    Grant us again to see Thy face;
      Lord, help our unbelief!

  2 When sorrow comes, and joys are flown,
      And fondest hopes lie dead,
    And blessings, long esteemed our own,
      Are now forever fled;
    When the bright promise of our spring
      Is but a withered leaf,
    Lord, to Thy truths still let us cling;
      Help Thou our unbelief!

  3 And when the powers of nature fail
      Upon the couch of pain,
    Nor love nor friendship can avail
      The spirit to detain;
    Then, Father, be our closing eyes
      Undimmed by tears of grief;
    And, if a trembling doubt arise,
      Help Thou our unbelief!

  2 Blessed Father, gracious One,
    Thou hast sent thy holy Son;
    He will give the light I need,
    He my trembling steps will lead.

  3 Through this world, uncertain, dim,
    Let me ever learn of him;
    From his precepts wisdom draw,
    Make his life my solemn law.

  4 Thus in deed, and thought, and word,
    Led by Jesus Christ the Lord,
    In my weakness, thus shall I
    Learn to live and learn to die;

  5 Learn to live in peace and love,
    Like the perfect ones above;--
    Learn to die without a fear,
    Feeling Thee, my Father, near.

  1 When in thine hour of conflict, Lord,
    The tempter to thy soul was nigh,
    Or when that bitter cup was poured
    In thy deep garden-agony,--

  2 Not then, when uttermost thy need,
    Seemed light across thy soul to break;
    No seraph form was seen to speed,
    Nor yet the voice of comfort spake;

  3 Till, by thine own triumphant word,
    The victory over ill was won;
    Until the voice of faith was heard,
    "Thy will, O God, not mine, be done!"

  4 Lord, bring those precious moments back,
    When fainting against sin we strain;
    Or in thy counsels fail to track
    Aught but the present grief and pain.

  5 In weakness, help us to contend;
    In darkness, yield to God our will;
    And true hearts, faithful to the end,
    Cheer by thine holy angels still!

    Strength of my desiring heart,

    For this I pray,--Let me, Thy grace possessing,
      Seek to be guided by Thy will divine.

  2 Not for earth's treasures, for her joys the dearest,
      Would I my supplications raise to Thee;
    Not for the hopes that to my heart are nearest,
      But only that I give that heart to Thee.

  3 I pray that Thou wouldst guide and guard me ever;
      Cleanse, by Thy power, from every stain of sin;
    I will Thy blessing ask on each endeavor,
      And thus Thy promised peace my soul shall win.

    From vain pursuits and maddening cares;
    From lonely woes that wring thy breast,
    The world's allurements, toils, and snares.

  2 Return unto thy rest, my soul,
    From all the wanderings of thy thought;
    From sickness unto death made whole;
    Safe through a thousand perils brought.

  3 Then to thy rest, my soul, return,
    From passions every hour at strife;
    Sin's works, and ways, and wages, spurn,
    Lay hold upon eternal life.

  4 God is thy rest; with heart inclined
    To keep His word, that word believe;
    Christ is thy rest; with lowly mind,
    His light and easy yoke receive.

  1 Thou hidden love of God, whose height,
    Whose depth unfathomed, no man knows;
    I see from far Thy beauteous light,
    Inly I sigh for Thy repose.
    My heart is pained; nor can it be
    At rest, till it find rest in Thee.

  2 Thy secret voice invites me still
    The sweetness of Thy yoke to prove;
    And fain I would; but though my will
    Seem fixed, yet wide my passions rove;
    Yet hindrances strew all the way;
    I aim at Thee, yet from Thee stray.

  3 'Tis mercy all, that Thou hast brought
    My mind to seek her peace in Thee;
    Yet, while I seek, but find Thee not,
    No peace my wandering soul shall see.
    O, when shall all my wanderings end,
    And all my steps to Thee-ward tend!

  4 Is there a thing beneath the sun,
    That strives with Thee my heart to share?
    Ah! tear it thence, and reign alone,
    The Lord of every motion there!
    Then shall my heart from earth be free,
    When it hath found repose in Thee.

  1 Send kindly light amid the encircling gloom,
          And lead me on!
    The night is dark, and I am far from home;
          Lead Thou me on!
    Keep Thou my feet: I do not ask to see
    The distant scene; one step enough for me.

  2 I was not ever thus, nor prayed that Thou
          Shouldst lead me on;
    I loved to choose and see my path; but now
          Lead Thou me on!
    I loved day's dazzling light, and, spite of fears,
    Pride ruled my will: remember not past years!

  3 So long Thy power hath blessed me, surely still
          'Twill lead me on
    Through dreary doubt, through pain and sorrow, till
          The night is gone,
    And with the morn those angel faces smile
    Which I have loved long since, and lost awhile.

  1 My God! permit me not to be
    A stranger to myself and Thee;
    Amidst a thousand thoughts I rove,
    Forgetful of my highest love.

  2 Why should my passions mix with earth,
    And thus debase my heavenly birth?
    Why should I cleave to things below,
    And let my God, my Saviour, go?

  3 Call me away from flesh and sense;
    One sovereign word can draw me thence;
    I would obey Thy voice divine,
    And all inferior joys resign.

  4 Be earth, with all her strife, withdrawn;
    Let noise and vanity be gone;
    In secret silence of the mind,
    My heaven, and there my God, I find.

    With gracious words still comfort me;

    Free me from every weight; nor fear
    Nor sin can come, if Thou art near.

  2 From all eternity, with love
    Unchangeable Thou hast me viewed;
    Ere knew this beating heart to move,
    Thy tender mercies me pursued;
    Ever with me may they abide,

  3 In suffering be Thy love my peace;
    In weakness be Thy love my power;
    And when the storms of life shall cease,
    O Father! in my latest hour,
    In death as life, be Thou my guide,
    And draw me closer to Thy side.

  1 I Want the spirit of power within,
    Of love, and of a healthful mind:
    Of power to conquer every sin;
    Of love to God and all mankind;
    Of health that pain and death defies,
    Most vigorous when the body dies.

  2 O, that the Comforter would come,
    Nor visit as a transient guest,
    But fix in me his constant home,
    And keep possession of my breast;
    And make my soul his loved abode,
    The temple of indwelling God!

                              Watchfulness.


  1 I want a principle within
      Of jealous, godly fear;
    A sensibility to sin,
      A pain to find it near.

  2 I want the first approach to feel
      Of pride, or fond desire;
    To catch the wandering of my will,
      And quench the kindling fire.

  3 From Thee that I no more may part,
      No more Thy goodness grieve,
    The filial awe, the fleshly heart,
      The tender conscience give.

  4 Quick as the apple of an eye,
      O God, my conscience make!
    Awake my soul, when sin is nigh,
      And keep it still awake.

  1   My God, my strength, my hope,
      On Thee I cast my care,
    With humble confidence look up,
      And know Thou hear'st my prayer.
      Give me on Thee to wait,
      Till I can all things do;
    On Thee, almighty to create,
      Almighty to renew.

  2   I want a sober mind,
      A self-renouncing will,
    That tramples down and casts behind
      The baits of pleasing ill;
      A soul inured to pain,
      To hardship, grief, and loss,
    Bold to take up, firm to sustain,
      The consecrated cross.

  3   I want a godly fear,
      A quick-discerning eye,
    That looks to Thee when sin is near,
      And bids the tempter fly;
      A spirit still prepared,
      And armed with jealous care,
    Forever standing on its guard,
      And watching unto prayer.

  4   I want a true regard,
      A single, steady aim,
    Unmoved by threatening or reward,
      To Thee and Thy great name;
      This blessing above all,
      Always to pray, I want:
    Out of the deep on Thee to call,
      And never, never faint.

  5   I rest upon Thy word;
      The promise is for me;
    My succor and salvation, Lord,
      Shall surely come from Thee;
      But let me still abide,
      Nor from my hope remove,
    Till Thou my patient spirit guide
      Into Thy perfect love.

  1 As the hart, with eager looks,
    Panteth for the water-brooks,
    So my soul, athirst for Thee,
    Pants the living God to see;
    When, O, when, without a fear,
    Lord, shall I to Thee draw near?

  2 Why art thou cast down, my soul?
    God, thy God, shall make thee whole;
    Why art thou disquieted?
    God shall lift thy fallen head,
    And His countenance benign
    Be the saving health of thine.

  1   O, where shall rest be found,
      Rest for the weary soul?
    'Twere vain the ocean depths to sound,
      Or pierce to either pole:

  2   The world can never give
      The rest for which we sigh;
    'Tis not the whole of life to live,
      Nor all of death to die.

  3   In Thee we end our quest;
      Alone are found in Thee
    The life of perfect love,--the rest
      Of immortality.

              There Remaineth a Rest for the People of God.


  1 Lord, I believe a rest remains,
      To all Thy people known;
    A rest where pure enjoyment reigns,
      And Thou art loved alone.

  2 A rest, where all our soul's desire
      Is fixed on things above;
    Where fear, and sin, and grief expire,
      Cast out by perfect love.

  3 O, that I now that rest might know,
      Believe, and enter in;
    Now, Father, now the power bestow,
      And let me cease from sin.

  4 Remove all hardness from my heart,
      All unbelief remove;
    To me the rest of faith impart,
      The sabbath of Thy love.

  1   That blessed law of Thine,
      Father, to me impart;--
    The Spirit's law of life divine,
      O, write it in my heart!

  2   Implant it deep within,
      Whence it may ne'er remove,--
    The law of liberty from sin,
      The perfect law of love.

  3   Thy nature be my law,
      Thy spotless sanctity,
    And sweetly every moment draw
      My happy soul to Thee.

  1 O Lord! how happy should we be,
    If we could leave our cares to Thee,
      If we from self could rest,
    And feel at heart that One above,
    In perfect wisdom, perfect love,
      Is working for the best.

  2 For when we kneel and cast our care
    Upon our God in humble prayer,
      With strengthened souls we rise;
    Sure that our Father, who is nigh
    To hear the ravens when they cry,
      Will hear His children's cries.

  3 O, may these trustless hearts of ours
    The lesson learn from birds and flowers,
      And learn from self to cease,--
    Leave all things to our Father's will,
    And, on His mercy, leaning still,
      Find, in each trial, peace!

  1   Forever with the Lord!
      So, Father, let it be;
    Life from the dead is in that word,
      'Tis immortality.

  2   Here in the body pent,
      Absent from Thee I roam;
    Yet nightly pitch my moving tent
      A day's march nearer home.

  3   My Father's house on high!
      Home of my soul, how near
    At times to faith's foreseeing eye
      Thy golden gates appear!

  4   I hear at morn and even,
      At noon and midnight hour,
    The choral harmonies of heaven
      Earth's Babel-tongues o'erpower.

  5   And then I feel, that He,
      Remembered or forgot,
    The Lord, is never far from me,
      Though I perceive Him not.

  6   Forever with the Lord!
      Father, if 'tis Thy will,
    The promise of that blessed word
      Even here to me fulfil.

  7   Be Thou at my right hand,
      Then can I never fail;
    Uphold Thou me, and I shall stand;
      Help, and I must prevail.

    Right spirits, Lord, in us renew!
    Commence we now that higher state,
    Now do Thy will as angels do.

    Learn every lesson of his love;
    And be from grace to glory led,

  1 O Love, how cheering is Thy ray!
    All pain before Thy presence flies;
    Care, anguish, sorrow, melt away,
    Where'er Thy healing beams arise:
    O Father! nothing may I see,
    And nought desire or seek, but Thee.

  2 Unwearied may I this pursue,
    Dauntless to this high prize aspire;
    Each hour within my soul renew
    This holy flame, this heavenly fire;
    And day and night be all my care
    To guard the sacred treasure there.

  3 O, that I as a little child
    May follow Thee, and never rest,
    Till sweetly Thou hast breathed a mild
    And lowly mind into my breast!
    Nor ever may we parted be,
    Till I become as one with Thee.

  4 Still let Thy love point out my way;
    How wondrous things that love hath wrought!
    Still lead me, lest I go astray;
    Direct my word, inspire my thought;
    And if I fall, soon may I hear
    Thy voice, and know Thy love is near.

  1 Quiet, Lord, my froward heart;
    Make me loving, meek, and mild,
    Upright, simple, free from art;
    Make me as a little child;
    From distrust and envy free;
    Pleased with all that pleaseth Thee.

  2 What Thou shalt to-day provide
    Let me as a child receive;
    What to-morrow may betide
    Calmly to Thy wisdom leave;
    'Tis enough that Thou wilt care;
    Why should I the burden bear?

  3 As a little child relies

    Knows beneath his father's eyes
    He is never left alone;
    So would I with Thee abide,

      Freedom from earthly ill;

      With its dove-pinion still!

  2   O, let a sense of Thee,

    My bosom-guest forever be,
      Where'er I rest or move!

  3   A heavenly light serene,
      With its unfading beams,
    Within my trusting heart be seen,
      More bright than childhood's dreams!

      Thy presence round my way;
    Made by Thine aiding spirit free;
      Thy love, my joy and stay.

    O give me of that living stream,

    Forth from the presence of our God,
    Through fields by holy angels trod!

  2 I thirst!--O bounteous Source of Truth,
    Give coolness to my fevered youth;
    Make the sick heart more strong and wise;
    Take spectral visions from mine eyes;
    O, let me quench my thirst in Thee,
    And pure, and strong, and holy be!

  3 I thirst!--O God, great Source of Love!
    Infinite Life streams from above.
    O, give one drop, and let me live!
    The barren world has naught to give;
    No solace have its streams for me;
    I thirst alone for heaven and Thee.

  1       Wilt Thou not visit me?
    The plant beside me feels Thy gentle dew;
          Each blade of grass I see,
    From Thy deep earth its quickening moisture drew.

  2       Wilt Thou not visit me?
    Thy morning calls on me with cheering tone;
          And every hill and tree
    Lend but one voice, the voice of Thee alone.

  3       Come! for I need Thy love,
    More than the flower the dew, or grass the rain;
          Come, like Thy holy dove,
    And let me in Thy sight rejoice to live again.

  4       Yes! Thou wilt visit me;
    Nor plant nor tree Thine eye delights so well,
          As when, from sin set free,
    Man's spirit comes with Thine in peace to dwell.

    Rise, from transitory things,

    Time shall soon this earth remove;

    Upward tends to His abode,

    E'en though it be a cross

    Nearer, my God, to Thee,
      Nearer to Thee!

  2 Though, like the wanderer,
      The sun gone down,
    Darkness be over me,
      My rest a stone;
    Yet in my dreams I'd be
    Nearer, my God, to Thee,--
      Nearer to Thee!

  3 There let the way appear,
      Steps unto heaven;
    All that Thou sendest me,
      In mercy given;
    Angels to beckon me
    Nearer, my God, to Thee,--
      Nearer to Thee!

  4 Then with my waking thoughts,
      Bright with Thy praise,
    Out of my stony griefs,
      Bethel I'll raise;
    So by my woes to be
    Nearer, my God, to Thee,--
      Nearer to Thee!

  5 Or if on joyful wing,
      Cleaving the sky,
    Sun, moon, and stars forgot,
      Upward I fly;
    Still all my song shall be,--
    Nearer, my God, to Thee,
      Nearer to Thee!

    Henceforth my chief desire shall be
    To dedicate myself to Thee.

  2 Whate'er pursuits my time employ,
    One thought shall fill my soul with joy;
    That silent, secret thought shall be,
    That all my hopes are fixed on Thee.

  3 Thy glorious eye pervadeth space;
    Thy presence, Lord, fills every place;
    And, wheresoe'er my lot may be,

  4 Renouncing every worldly thing,
    And safe beneath Thy sheltering wing,
    My sweetest thought henceforth shall be,
    That all I want I find in Thee.

    All creation is full of the glory of love.

    God of truth! it is Thou who hast shed down each ray

    From the depths of my spirit, to Thee will I give
    Ever-thankful affection, as long as I live.

    Fill my soul with sacred pleasure,
      While I sing redeeming love.

  3 Thou didst seek me when a stranger,
      Wandering from the fold above;
    Thou, to save my soul from danger,
      Didst redeem me with Thy love.

      Safe through life thus far I've come;
    Safe, O Lord, when life is ended,
      Bring me to my heavenly home.

      The world, before so fair;

    Through the valley and shadow of death though I stray,
    Since Thou art my guardian, no evil I fear;
    Thy rod shall defend me, Thy staff be my stay;
    No harm can befall with my Comforter near.

  3 In the midst of affliction my table is spread;
    With blessings unmeasured my cup runneth o'er;

  4 Let goodness and mercy, my bountiful God,
    Still follow my steps till I meet Thee above;
    I seek, by the path which my forefathers trod
    Through the land of their sojourn, Thy kingdom of love.

    And give me confidence and peace.

  2 Give me a faith shall never fail,
    One that shall always work by love;
    And then, whatever foes assail,
    They shall but higher courage move
    More boldly for the truth to strive,
    And more by faith in Thee to live:

  3 A heart, that, when my days are glad,
    May never from Thy way decline,
    And when the sky of life grows sad,
    May still submit its will to Thine,--
    A heart that loves to trust in Thee,
    A patient heart, create in me!

  1 O Father! humbly we repose
    Our souls on Thee, who dwell'st above,
    And bless Thee for the peace which flows
    From faith in Thine encircling love.

  2 Though every earthly trust may break,
    Infinite might belongs to Thee;
    Though every earthly friend forsake,
    Unchangeable Thou still wilt be.

  3 Though griefs may gather darkly round,
    They cannot veil us from Thy sight;
    Though vain all human aid be found,
    Thou every grief canst turn to light.

  4 All things Thy wise designs fulfil,
    In earth beneath, and heaven above,
    And good breaks out from every ill,
    Through faith in Thine encircling love.

  1 We all, O Father, all are Thine;
    All feel Thy providential care;
    And, through each varying scene of life,
    Alike Thy constant love we share.

  2 And whether grief oppress the heart;
    Or whether joy elate the breast;
    Or life still keep its little course;
    Or death invite the heart to rest;--

  4 All are Thy messengers, and all
    Thy sacred pleasure, Lord, obey;
    And all are training man to dwell
    Nearer to heaven, and nearer Thee.

  1 O let my trembling soul be still,
    While darkness veils this mortal eye,
    And wait Thy wise and holy will,
    Though wrapped in fears and mystery:
    I cannot, Lord, Thy purpose see;
    Yet all is well since ruled by Thee!

  2 When, mounted on Thy clouded car,
    Thou send'st Thy darker spirits down,
    I can discern Thy light afar,
    Thy light sweet beaming through their frown;
    And, should I faint a moment, then
    I think of Thee, and smile again.

  3 So, trusting in Thy love, I tread
    The narrow path of duty on;
    What though some cherished joys are fled?
    What though some flattering dreams are gone?
    Yet purer, nobler joys remain,
    And peace is won through conquered pain.

  1 See the Lord, thy keeper, stand,

    Lo! He holds thee by the hand,

    Shadows with His wings thy head;
    Guards from all impending harms;
    Round thee and beneath are spread
      The everlasting arms.

  2 God shall bless thy going out,
      Shall bless thy coming in;
    Kindly compass thee about,
      And guard from every sin.
    Lean upon thy Father's breast;
    He thy quiet spirit keeps;
    Rest in Him, securely rest;
      Thy Guardian never sleeps.

  3 O, my soul, unceasing pray,
      And in thy God confide!
    He our faltering steps shall stay,
      Nor suffer us to slide:
    He is still our sure defence,
    We his ceaseless care shall prove,
    Kept by watchful Providence
      And ever-waking love.

      Whom winds and seas obey;
    He shall direct thy wandering feet,
      He shall prepare thy way.

  3   No profit canst thou gain
      By self-consuming care;
    To Him commend thy cause,--His ear
      Attends the softest prayer.

  4   Then on the Lord rely,
      So safe shall thou go on;
    Fix on His work thy steadfast eye,
      So shall thy work be done.

      When trouble's hour is near;
    A very present help is He;
      Therefore we will not fear.

  2 Although the pillars of the earth
      Shall clean removed be,
    The very mountains carried forth,
      And cast into the sea;

  3 Although the waters rage and swell,
      So that the earth shall shake;
    Yea, and the solid mountain roots
      Shall with the tempest quake;

  4 There is a river that makes glad
      The city of our God;
    The tabernacle's holy place
      Of the Most High's abode.

  5 The Lord is in the midst of her,
      Removed she shall not be;
    Because the Lord our God himself
      Shall help her speedily.

  6 The Lord our strength and refuge is,
      When trouble's hour is near;
    A very present help is He;
      Therefore we will not fear.

  1   Give to the winds thy fears!
      Hope and be undismayed!
    God hears thy sighs, and counts thy tears;
      God shall lift up thy head.

  2   Through waves, through clouds and storms,
      He gently clears thy way;
    Wait thou His time, so shall the night
      Soon end in joyous day.

  3   He everywhere hath rule,
      And all things serve His might;
    His every act pure blessing is,
      His path, unsullied light.

  4   Thou comprehend'st Him not;
      Yet earth and heaven tell,
    God sits as sovereign on the throne;
      He ruleth all things well.

  5   Thou seest our weakness, Lord,
      Our hearts are known to Thee;
    O, lift Thou up the sinking hand,
      Confirm the feeble knee!

  6   Let us, in life or death,
      Boldly Thy truth declare;
    And publish, with our latest breath,
      Thy love and guardian care.

    When joy makes glad the livelong day,

      The fainting soul oppress;
    When tears at wakeful midnight flow,
      And morn brings heaviness.

      Rejoice in life and death;
    Rejoice when threatening storms are near,
      And comfort languisheth.

  4   When should not they rejoice,
      Whom Christ his brethren calls;
    Who hear and know his guiding voice,
      When on their hearts it falls?

  5   So, though our path is steep,
      And many a tempest lowers,
    Shall his own peace our spirits keep,
      And Christ's dear love be ours.

    Come, seek your Heavenly Father's face,
      And peace and gladness find.

      Unchanged from day to day;
    We'll drop our burden at His feet,

  1 God moves in a mysterious way,
      His wonders to perform;
    He plants His footsteps in the sea,
      And rides upon the storm.

  2 Deep in unfathomable mines
      Of never-failing skill,
    He treasures up His vast designs,
      And works His sovereign will.

  3 Ye fearful saints! fresh courage take;
      The clouds ye so much dread
    Are big with mercy, and will break
      In blessings on your head.

  4 Judge not the Lord by feeble sense,
      But trust Him for His grace;
    Behind a frowning providence
      He hides a smiling face.

  5 His purposes will ripen fast,
      Unfolding every hour;
    The bud may have a bitter taste,
      But sweet will be the flower.

  6 Blind unbelief is sure to err,
      And scan his work in vain;
    God is His own interpreter,
      And He will make it plain.

      Too oft, with stubborn will,
    We blindly shun the latent good,
      And grasp the specious ill,--

      Thy mercy still supply!
    The good unasked, O Father, grant;
      The ill, though asked, deny!

    On Thine eternal will depend;

  2 Though dark my path, and sad my lot,

    But breathe the prayer divinely taught,
      Thy will, my God, be done!

  3 What though in lonely grief I sigh
    For friends beloved, no longer nigh?
    Submissive still would I reply,
      Thy will, my God, be done!

  4 If Thou shouldst call me to resign
    What most I prize,--it ne'er was mine,--
    I only yield Thee what is Thine;
      Thy will, my God, be done!

  5 Should pining sickness waste away

    Blend it with Thine, and take away
    Whate'er now makes it hard to say,

    Joy to find, in every station,
      Something still to do and bear.

  4 Think what Spirit dwells within thee;
      Think what Father's smiles are thine;
    Think that Jesus died to win thee;
      Child of heaven, canst thou repine?

  5 Haste thee on from cross to glory,
      Armed by faith and winged by prayer;
    Heaven's eternal day's before thee,
      God's own hand shall lead thee there.

                                 Faith.


  1 The dove, let loose in Eastern skies,
      Returning fondly home,
    Ne'er stoops to earth her wing, nor flies
      Where idle warblers roam;

  2 But high she shoots through air and light,
      Above all low delay,
    Where nothing earthly bounds her flight,
      Nor shadow dims her way.

  3 So grant me, Lord, from every snare
      And stain of passion free,
    Aloft, through faith's serener air,
      To urge my course to Thee:

  4 No sin to cloud, no lure to stay,
      My soul, as home she springs;
    Thy sunshine on her joyful way,
      Thy freedom on her wings!

                          The Strength of Hope.


  1 The world may change from old to new,
      From new to old again;
    Yet hope and heaven, forever true,
      Within man's heart remain.
    The dreams that bless the weary soul,
      The struggles of the strong,
    Are steps towards some happy goal,
      The story of hope's song.

  2 Hope leads the child to plant the flower,
      The man to sow the seed;
    Nor leaves fulfilment to her hour,--
      But prompts again to deed.
    And ere upon the old man's dust
      The grass is seen to wave,
    We look through falling tears, to trust
      Hope's sunshine on the grave.

  3 O, no! it is no flattering lure,
      No fancy weak or fond,
    When hope would bid us rest secure
      In better life beyond.
    Nor love, nor shame, nor grief, nor sin,
      Her promise may gainsay;
    The voice divine hath spoke within,
      And God did ne'er betray.

  1 Not that Thy boundless love, my God,
      Sheds blessing on my way,
    And gilds as with a heavenly beam
      The darkness of earth's day,--
    Not now for breath of summer flowers,
      For smiles of sunny skies,
    The still, small voice of gratitude
      Shall to Thine ear arise.

  2 I bless Thee for the ministry
      Of sorrow's lonely hour,
    When darkly o'er my stricken head
      I see the storm-clouds lower;
    Thy love can still the billows' roar,
      And whisper, "Peace; be still!"
    While faith doth on Thy promise rest,
      And bless the Father's will.

  3 The shadow and the storm must come;
      O, grant that faith divine
    Which triumphs o'er the might of grief,
      And moulds man's will to Thine!
    In hours of deepest gloom, mine eye
      One blessed ray can see;
    A sunlit side that cloud must have,
      Which hides Thy face from me.

                             The Bitter Cup.


  1 Thy will be done! I will not fear
    The fate provided by Thy love;
    Though clouds and darkness shroud me here,
    I know that all is bright above.

  2 The stars of heaven are shining on,
    Though these frail eyes are dimmed with tears;
    And though the hopes of earth be gone,
    Yet are not ours the immortal years?

  3 Father! forgive the heart that clings,
    Thus trembling, to the things of time;
    And bid the soul, on angel wings,
    Ascend into a purer clime.

  4 There shall no doubts disturb its trust,
    No sorrows dim celestial love;
    But these afflictions of the dust,
    Like shadows of the night, remove.

  5 That glorious life will well repay
    This life of toil and care and woe;
    O Father! joyful on my way,
    To drink Thy bitter cup, I go.

                         I Say unto You, Watch!


  1   Ye servants of the Lord!
      Each in your office wait,
    Observant of His heavenly word,
      And watchful at His gate.

  2   Let all your lamps be bright,
      And trim the golden flame:
    Gird up your loins, as in His sight;
      For holy is His name.

  3   Watch! 'tis your Lord's command;
      And while we speak, He's near:
    Mark the first signal of His hand,
      And ready all appear.

  4   O happy servant he
      In such a posture found!
    He shall his Lord with rapture see,
      And be with honor crowned.

                                Patience.


  1 Shall we grow weary in our watch,
    And murmur at the long delay,
    Impatient of our Father's time
      And his appointed way?

  2 O, oft a deeper test of faith
    Than prison-cell, or martyr's stake,
    The self-renouncing watchfulness
      Of silent prayer may make.

  3 We gird us bravely to rebuke
    Our erring brother in the wrong;
    And in the ear of pride and power
      Our warning voice is strong.

  4 Easier to smite with Peter's sword
    Than watch one hour in humbling prayer;
    Life's great things, like the Syrian lord,
      Our hearts can do and dare:

  5 But, O, we shrink from Jordan's side,
    From waters which alone can save;
    And murmur for Abana's banks
      And Pharpar's brighter wave.

  6 O Thou, who in the garden's shade
    Didst wake thy weary ones again,
    Who slumbered at that fearful hour,
      Forgetful of thy pain,--

  7 Bend o'er us now, as over them,
    And set our sleep-bound spirits free,
    Nor leave us slumbering in the watch
      Our souls should keep with thee!

    Who serveth not another's will;
    Whose armor is his honest thought,

    Whose soul is still prepared for death;
    Not tied unto the world with care
    Of public fame or private breath;

  3 Who God doth late and early pray
    More of His grace than goods to lend,
    And walks with man, from day to day,
    As with a brother and a friend!

  4 This man is freed from servile bands
    Of hope to rise, or fear to fall;
    Lord of himself, though not of lands,
    And having nothing, yet hath all.

      Thyself, that mystic shrine;
    Let hate of all that's dark endure,
      And love of all divine.

  3   Let saintly thoughts be shown
      In act by saintly things;
    Like glories through the temple thrown,

      Its fountain holy show;
    Reflecting, with a softened gleam,

      God doth Himself impart,
    And for His temple and His throne
      Doth choose the pure in heart.

               "If He Giveth Quiet, Who Can Make Trouble?"


  1 Quiet from God! how beautiful to keep
    This treasure, the All-merciful hath given;
    To feel, when we awake and when we sleep,
    Its incense round us, like a breath from heaven!

  2 To sojourn in the world, and yet apart;
    To dwell with God, and still with man to feel;
    To bear about forever in the heart
    The gladness which His spirit doth reveal!

  3 Who shall make trouble, then? Not evil minds
    Which like a shadow o'er creation lower;
    The soul which peace hath thus attuned finds
    How strong within doth reign the Calmer's power.

  4 What shall make trouble? Not the holy thought
    Of the departed; that will be a part
    Of those undying things His peace hath wrought
    Into a world of beauty in the heart.

  5 What shall make trouble? Not slow-wasting pain,
    Nor even the threatening, certain stroke of death;
    These do but wear away, then break, the chain
    Which bound the spirit down to things beneath.

  1 O, who shall say he knows the folds
    Which veil another's inmost heart,--
    The hopes, thoughts, wishes, which it holds,
    In which he never bore a part?
    That hidden world no eye can see,--
    O, who shall pierce its mystery?

  2 There may be hope as pure, as bright,
    As ever sought eternity,--
    There may be light,--clear, heavenly light,
    Where all seems cold and dark to thee;
    And when thy spirit mourns the dust,
    There may be trust,--delightful trust.

  3 Go, bend to God, and leave to Him
    The mystery of thy brother's heart,
    Nor vainly think his faith is dim,
    Because in thine it hath no part;
    He, too, is mortal,--and, like thee,
    Would soar to immortality.

  4 And if in duty's hallowed sphere,
    Like Christ, he meekly, humbly bends,--
    With hands unstained, and conscience clear,
    With life's temptations still contends,--
    O, leave him that unbroken rest,
    The peace that shrines a virtuous breast!

  5 But if his thoughts and hopes should err,
    Still view him with a gentle eye,--
    Remembering doubt, and change, and fear,
    Are woven in man's destiny;
    And when the clouds are passed away,
    That truth shall dawn with brightening day.

  1 Think gently of the erring one!
      O, let us not forget,
    However darkly stained by sin,
      He is our brother yet!
    Heir of the same inheritance,
      Child of the self-same God,
    He hath but stumbled in the path
      We have in weakness trod.

  2 Speak gently to the erring ones!
      We yet may lead them back,
    With holy words, and tones of love,
      From misery's thorny track.
    Forget not, brother, thou hast sinned,
      And sinful yet may'st be;
    Deal gently with the erring heart,
      As God hath dealt with thee.

  1 Speak gently,--it is better far
      To rule by love than fear;
    Speak gently,--let no harsh word mar
      The good we may do here.

  2 Speak gently to the young,--for they
      Will have enough to bear;
    Pass through this life as best they may,
      'Tis full of anxious care.

  3 Speak gently to the aged one,
      Grieve not the careworn heart;
    The sands of life are nearly run,
      Let them in peace depart.

  4 Speak gently to the erring ones;
      They must have toiled in vain;
    Perchance unkindness made them so;
      O, win them back again!

  5 Speak gently,--'tis a little thing,
      Dropped in the heart's deep well;
    The good, the joy, that it may bring,
      Eternity shall tell.

  1 Turn not from him who asks of thee
      A portion of thy store;
    Thou poor in worldly goods may'st be,
      Yet canst give what is more.

  2 The balm of comfort thou canst pour
      Into his grieving mind,
    Who oft is turned from wealth's proud door,
      With many a word unkind.

  3 Does any from the false world find
      Naught but reproach and scorn?
    Does any, stung by words unkind,
      Wish that he ne'er was born?

  4 Do thou raise up his drooping heart,
      Restore his wounded mind;
    Though naught of wealth thou canst impart
      Yet still thou may'st be kind.

  5 And oft again thy words shall wing
      Backward their course to thee,
    And in thy breast will prove a spring
      Of pure felicity.

      From earthly stain is free,
    View not with scorn the erring one,--
      He once was pure like thee.

  2 O, if the smiles of love are thine,
      Its joyous ecstasy,
    Shun not the poor forsaken one,--
      He once was loved like thee!

  3 And still, 'mid shame, and guilt, and woe,
      One Being loves him still,
    Who, blessing thee, hath poured on him
      The world's extremest ill.

  4 He knows the secret lure which led
      Those youthful steps astray;
    He knows that they who holiest are
      Might fall from Him away.

      "Go thou, and sin no more,"
    Save, save, the sinner from despair,
      And peace and hope restore.

    Judge him, for modes of faith, Thy foe,
    Or doom him to the realms of woe?

  3 Who with another's eye can read,
    Or worship by another's creed?
    Trusting Thy grace, we form our own,
    And bow to Thy commands alone.

  4 If wrong, correct; accept, if right;
    While, faithful, we improve our light,
    Condemning none, but zealous still
    To learn and follow all Thy will.

        It strikes the ear;
    It mounts in vain, it falls but coldly

    There's many a virtue unapplauded,

    But the burden of daily life must bear,

      Doth the spirit of prayer abide;
    When earth is lovely, and heaven serene,
      That spirit his course shall guide.

  3 And when the storm rages, and woe and wrath
      Would an earth-born courage quell,
    He knows that his God is around his path,
      And ordereth all things well.

    Is thrice more grateful, Lord, to Thee,

  2 In true and genuine faith we trace
    The source of every Christian grace;
    Within the pious heart it plays,
    A living fount of joy and praise.

    Where'er the stream has found its way;
    But where these spring not rich and fair,
    The stream has never wandered there.

  1 Thus said Jesus:--"Go and do
    As thou wouldst be done unto:"
    Here thy perfect duty see,
    All that God requires of thee.

  2 Wouldst thou, when thy faults are known,
    Wish that pardon should be shown?
    Be forgiving, then, and do
    As thou wouldst be done unto.

  3 Shouldst thou helpless be and poor,
    Wouldst thou not for aid implore?
    Think of others, then, and be
    What thou wouldst they should to thee.

  4 For compassion if thou call,
    Be compassionate to all;
    If thou wouldst affection find,
    Be affectionate and kind.

  5 If thou wouldst obtain the love
    Of thy gracious God above,
    Then to all His children be
    What thou wouldst they should to thee.

  1 Who is thy neighbor? he whom thou
      Hast power to aid or bless;
    Whose aching heart or burning brow
      Thy soothing hand may press.

  2 Thy neighbor? 'tis the fainting poor,
      Whose eye with want is dim;
    O, enter thou his humble door,
      With aid and peace for him.

  3 Thy neighbor? he who drinks the cup
      When sorrow drowns the brim;
    With words of high, sustaining hope,
      Go thou and comfort him.

  4 Thy neighbor? 'tis the weary slave,
      Fettered in mind and limb;
    He hath no hope this side the grave;
      Go thou and ransom him.

  5 Thy neighbor? pass no mourner by;
      Perhaps thou canst redeem

  1 Pour forth the oil,--pour boldly forth;
      It will not fail, until
    Thou failest vessels to provide
      Which it may largely fill.

  2 Make channels for the streams of love,
      Where they may broadly run;
    And love has overflowing streams,
      To fill them every one.

  3 But if at any time we cease
      Such channels to provide,
    The very founts of love for us
      Will soon be parched and dried.

  4 For we must share, if we would keep
      That blessing from above;
    Ceasing to give, we cease to have;--
      Such is the law of love.

  1 Beneath the thick but struggling clouds,
      We talk of Christian life;
    The words of Jesus on our lips,
      Our hearts with man at strife.

  2 Traditions, forms, and selfish aims,
      Have dimmed the inner light;
    Have closely veiled the spirit-world
      And angels from our sight.

  3 Strong souls and willing hands we need,
      Our temple to repair;
    Remove the gathering dust of years,
      And show the model fair.

  4 We slumber while the present calls,
      But darkness grows with rest;
    Wouldst thou see truth? To action wake,--
      Do the divine behest.

  1 This world is not a fleeting show,
      For man's illusion given;
    He that hath soothed a widow's woe,
    Or wiped an orphan's tear, doth know
      There's something here of heaven.

  2 And he who walks life's thorny way
      With feelings calm and even,
    Whose path is lit, from day to day,
    By virtue's bright and steady ray,
      Feels something here of heaven.

  3 He that the Christian course hath run,
      And all his foes forgiven,
    Hath measured out this life's short span
    In love to God and love to man,
      On earth has tasted heaven.

               Blessed Are Ye That Sow Beside All Waters.


  1 O, be not faithless! with the morn
      Cast thou abroad thy grain!
    At noontide faint not thou forlorn,
      At evening sow again!
    Blessed are they, whate'er betide,
    Who thus all waters sow beside.

  2 Thou knowest not which seed shall grow,
      Or which may die, or live;
    In faith, and hope, and patience, sow!
      The increase God shall give,
    According to His gracious will,--
    As best his purpose may fulfil.

  3 O, could our inward eye but view,
      Our hearts but feel aright,
    What faith, and love, and hope, can do,
      By their celestial might,
    We should not say, till these be dead,
    The power of miracle is fled.

  1 Love on! love on! but not the things that own
    The fleeting beauty of a summer day;
    Truth, virtue, spring from God's eternal throne,
    Nor quit the spirit when it leaves the clay:
                  Love them! love them!

  2 Love on! love on! though death and earthly change
    Bring mournful silence to a darkened home;
    Still let the heart rest where no eye grows strange,
    Where never falls a shadow from the tomb:
                  Love there! love there!

  3 Love on! love on! the voice of grief and wrong
    Comes from the palace and the poor man's cot;
    Bid the proud bend, and bid the weak be strong,
    And life's tired pilgrim meekly bear his lot:
                  Give strength! give peace!

  4 Love on! love on! and though the evening still
    Wear the stern clouds that veiled thy noonday sun,
    With changeless trust, with calm, unwavering will,
    Work! bravely work! till the last hour be done:
                  Love God! love Man!

    A holy inspiration rest,--
    Though painful be the chosen part,
    With doubts, and fears, and cares opprest!
    O, shrink not, brothers, though Christ's call
    Demand our youth, our strength, our all!

  2 No offering is made in vain;
    Some human soul shall feel our love;
    E'en weary hours of toil and pain
    Shall help to lift our souls above:
    And may our recompense be given,
    In leading many souls to heaven!

  3 And still trust on! with trembling hand,
    'Tis ours a little seed to sow;
    It springs at the divine command,--
    Shall, if God will, to ripeness grow;
    Beauty and fragrance it shall bring,
    And breathe an everlasting spring.

  1 The bud will soon become a flower,
      The flower become a seed;
    Then seize, O youth, the present hour,--
      Of that thou hast most need.

  2 Do thy best always,--do it now,--
      For in the present time,
    As in the furrows of a plough,
      Fall seeds of good or crime.

  3 The sun and rain will ripen fast
      Each seed that thou hast sown;
    And every act and word at last
      By its own fruit be known.

  4 And soon the harvest of thy toil
      Rejoicing thou shalt reap;
    Or o'er thy wild, neglected soil
      Go forth in shame to weep.

      Heard the solemn steps of Time,
    And the low, mysterious voices
      Of another clime?

  2 Early hath life's mighty question
      Thrilled within thy heart of youth,
    With a deep and strong beseeching,--
      What, and where, is truth?

  3 Not to ease and aimless quiet
      Doth the inward answer tend;
    But to works of love and duty,
      As our being's end.

  4 Earnest toil and strong endeavor
      Of a spirit which within
    Wrestles with familiar evil
      And besetting sin;

  5 And without, with tireless vigor,
      Steady heart, and purpose strong,
    In the power of Truth assaileth
      Every form of wrong.

      While still to Thee I tend;
    In all I do be Thou the way;
      In all be Thou the end.

  3   All may of Thee partake;
      Nothing so small can be,
    But draws, when acted for Thy sake,
      Greatness and worth from Thee.

  4   If done beneath Thy laws,
      E'en servile labors shine;
    Hallowed is toil, if this the cause;

    O, grant that we may own Thy hand
    No less in every grain of sand!

  2 With forests huge, of dateless time,
    Thy will has hung each peak sublime;
    But withered leaves beneath the tree
    Have tongues that tell as loud of Thee.

  3 Teach us that not a leaf can grow,
    Till life from Thee within it flow;
    That not a grain of dust can be,
    O Fount of being! save by Thee;

  4 That every human word and deed,
    Each flash of feeling, will, or creed,
    Hath solemn meaning from above,
    Begun and ended all in love.

  1 If on our daily course our mind
    Be set, to hallow all we find,
    New treasures still, of countless price,
    God will provide for sacrifice.

  2 Old friends, old scenes, will lovelier be,
    As more of heaven in each we see;
    Some softening gleam of love and prayer
    Shall dawn on every cross and care.

  3 O could we learn that sacrifice,
    What light would all around us rise!
    How would our hearts with wisdom talk
    Along life's dullest, dreariest walk!

  4 The trivial round, the common task,
    Will furnish all we ought to ask;
    Room to deny ourselves, a road
    To bring us daily nearer God.

  1 The uplifted eye and bended knee
    Are but vain homage, Lord, to Thee:
    In vain our lips Thy praise prolong,
    The heart a stranger to the song.

  2 Can rites, and forms, and flaming zeal,
    The breaches of Thy precepts heal?
    Or fasts and penance reconcile
    Thy justice, and obtain Thy smile?

  3 The pure, the humble, contrite mind,
    Sincere, and to Thy will resigned,
    To Thee a nobler offering yields
    Than Sheba's groves, or Sharon's fields.

  4 Love God and man,--this great command
    Doth on eternal pillars stand;
    This did Thine ancient prophets teach,
    And this Thy well-beloved preach.

    All around us clarion voices
      Call to duty stern and high.

  2 Thankfully we will rejoice in
      All the beauty God has given;
    But beware it does not win us
      From the work ordained of Heaven.

  3 Following every voice of mercy
      With a trusting, loving heart;
    Let us in life's earnest labor
      Still be sure to do our part.

    Lest the wretched faint and perish

    There's fruit in each wind-wafted seed,

  2 A whispered word may touch the heart,
      And call it back to life;
    A look of love bid sin depart,
      And still unholy strife.

  3 No act falls fruitless; none can tell
      How vast its power may be,
    Nor what results infolded dwell
      Within it silently.

  4 Work on, despair not; bring thy mite,
      Nor care how small it be;
    God is with all that serve the right,
      The holy, true, and free.

    In his spotless robe of white;
    For the sinful sword, his hand
    Bearing high the olive-wand.

  2 Through the camp, and through the court,
    Through the dark and deadly fort,
    On the mission of the dove,
    Speeds the minister of love;
    By his word the wildest tames,
    And the world to God reclaims;
    War, and wrath, and famine cease,
    Hushed around his path of peace.

      His earthly reign abhorred,
    Sword of the spirit, thee we draw,
      And battle for the Lord.

  3 We go! we go, to break the chains
      That bind the erring mind,
    And give the freedom that we feel
      To all of human kind.

  4 But, O, we wear no burnished steel,
      And seek no gory field;
    Our weapon is the word of God,
      His promise is our shield.

      We fear no earthly harm;
    We know it is our Father's work,
      We rest upon His arm.

  1 Tell me not, in mournful numbers,
      Life is but an empty dream;
    For the soul is dead that slumbers,
      And things are not what they seem.

  2 Life is real! life is earnest!
      And the grave is not its goal;
    Dust thou art, to dust returnest,
      Was not spoken of the soul.

      Is our destined end and way;

    Still achieving, still pursuing,

      Increase my courage, Lord!
    I'll bear the toil, endure the pain,
      Supported by Thy word.

  5 The saints in all this glorious war
      Shall conquer, though they die;
    They see the triumph from afar,
      And seize it with their eye.

  6 When Thy illustrious day shall rise,
      And all Thy armies shine
    In robes of victory through the skies,

      That love and mercy bring!

  2 There is a battle to be fought,
      An upward race to run,
    A crown of glory to be sought,
      A victory to be won.

  3 O, faint not, Christian! for thy sighs
      Are heard before God's throne;
    The race must come before the prize,
      The cross before the crown.

  1 Breast the wave, Christian! when it is strongest;
    Watch for day, Christian! when the night's longest;
    Onward and onward still be thine endeavor;
    The rest that remaineth will be forever.

  2 Fight the fight, Christian! Jesus is o'er thee;
    Run the race, Christian! heaven is before thee;
    He who hath promised faltereth never;
    The love of eternity flows on forever.

  3 Lift the eye, Christian! just as it closeth;
    Raise the heart, Christian! ere it reposeth;
    Thee from the love of Christ nothing shall sever;
    Mount when the work is done,--praise God forever!

  1 Awake, my soul! lift up thine eyes;
    See where thy foes against thee rise,
    In long array, a numerous host;
    Awake, my soul! or thou art lost.

  2 Here giant danger threatening stands,
    Mustering his pale, terrific bands;
    There, pleasure's silken banners spread,
    And willing souls are captives led.

  3 See where rebellious passions rage,
    And fierce desires and lusts engage;
    The meanest foe of all the train
    Has thousands and ten thousands slain.

  4 Come, then, my soul! now learn to wield
    The weight of thine immortal shield;
    Put on the armor from above
    Of heavenly truth and heavenly love.

  5 The terror and the charm repel,
    And powers of earth, and powers of hell;
    The Man of Calvary triumphed here;
    Why should his faithful followers fear?

  1 There's a strife we all must wage,
    From life's entrance to its close;
    Blest the bold who dare engage!
    Woe for him who seeks repose!

  2 Honored they who firmly stand,
    While the conflict presses round;
    God's own banner in their hand,
    In his service faithful found.

  3 What our foes? Each thought impure
    Passions fierce, that tear the soul;
    Every ill that we can cure;
    Every crime we can control;

  4 Every suffering which our hand
    Can with soothing care assuage;
    Every evil of our land;
    Every error of our age.

  5 On, then, to the glorious field!
    He who dies his life shall save;
    God himself shall be our shield,
    He shall bless and crown the brave.

  2 Sin, o'er sense so softly stealing;
      Doubt, that would my strength impair;
    Hence at once from life and feeling!--
      Now my cross I gladly bear.

  3 Up, my soul! with clear sedateness
      Read heaven's law, writ bright and broad,
    Up! a sacrifice to greatness,
      Truth, and goodness,--up to God!

  4 Up to labor! from thee shaking
      Off the bonds of sloth, be brave!
    Give thyself to prayer and waking;
      Toil some fainting heart to save!

  1 Go, suffering pilgrim of the earth,
    Go, conscious of thy heavenly birth,
    And, 'midst the storms that round thee rise,
    Retrace thy journey to the skies.

  2 What though the wild winds rage around?
    Thou wilt not tremble at the sound;
    What though the waters o'er thee roll?
    They touch not thine immortal soul.

  3 See where, arrayed on either hand,
    The direful train of passions stand;
    See hatred, envy, bar thy way,
    And foes more subtle still than they.

  4 But, robed in innocence and truth,
    From all temptation guard thy youth;
    And from thy vestment's sacred bound
    Shake the dread fiends that cling around.

  5 Go with pure heart and steadfast eyes,
    Strive on till that bright morn shall rise
    That gives thee to thy blest abode,
    To rest forever with thy God.

  1 Faint not, poor traveller, though the way
    Be rough, like that thy Saviour trod;
    Though cold and stormy lower the day,
    This path of suffering leads to God.

  2 Nay, sink not, though from every limb
    Are starting drops of toil and pain;
    Thou dost but share the lot of Him
    With whom his followers are to reign.

  3 Christian! thy friend, thy master, prayed,
    While dread and anguish shook his frame,
    Then met his sufferings undismayed;
    Wilt thou not strive to do the same?

  4 O, thinkest thou his Father's love
    Shone round him then with fainter rays
    Than now, when, throned all height above,
    Unceasing voices hymn his praise?

  5 Go, sufferer, calmly meet the woes
    Which God's own mercy bids thee bear;
    Then, rising as thy Saviour rose,
    Go, his eternal victory share.

  1 Be still, my heart! these anxious cares
    To thee are burdens, thorns, and snares,
    They cast dishonor on thy Lord,
    And contradict His gracious word.

  2 Brought safely by His hand thus far,
    Why wilt thou now give place to fear?
    How canst thou want if He provide,
    Or lose thy way with such a guide?

  3 Did ever trouble yet befall,
    And He refuse to hear thy call?
    And has He not His promise past,
    That thou shalt overcome at last?

  4 He who has helped me hitherto
    Will help me all my journey through,
    And give me daily cause to raise
    New trophies to His endless praise.

                             Refuge in God.


  1 We would leave, O God, to Thee,
    Every anxious care and fear;
    Thou the troubled thought canst see,
    Thou canst dry the bitter tear.

  2 Thou dost care for us, we know,--
    Care with all a Father's love;
    Thou canst make each earthly woe
    Work to higher bliss above.

  3 On this faith we fain would rest;
    Strengthen Thou its blessed power!
    Steadfast keep it in our breast,
    Through each dark and trying hour.

  1 How little of ourselves we know,
    Before a grief the heart has felt!
    The lessons that we learn of woe
    Make strong the soul, as well as melt.

  2 The energies too stern for mirth,
    The reach of thought, the strength of will,
    'Mid cloud and tempest have their birth,
    Though blight and blast their course fulfil.

  3 And yet 'tis when it mourns and fears,
    The laden spirit feels forgiven;
    And through the mist of falling tears
    We catch the clearest glimpse of heaven.

    A blessing for the eyes that weep.

  2 The light of smiles shall fill again
    The lids that now o'erflow with tears,
    And weary hours of woe and pain
    Are earnests of serener years.

  3 O, there are days of hope and rest
    For every dark and troubled night!
    And grief may bide, an evening guest,
    But joy shall come with morning light.

  4 And ye, who o'er a friend's low bier
    Now shed the bitter drops like rain,
    Know that a brighter, happier sphere
    Will give him to your arms again.

    E'er deem Thy chastisements severe;
    But may this heart, by sorrow taught,
    Calm each wild wish, each idle fear.

  2 Thy mercy bids all nature bloom;
    The sun shines bright, and man is gay;
    Thine equal mercy spreads the gloom
    That darkens o'er his little day.

  3 Full many a throb of grief and pain
    Thy frail and erring child must know;
    But not one prayer is breathed in vain,
    Nor does one tear unheeded flow.

  4 Thy various messengers employ;
    Thy purposes of love fulfil;
    And, 'mid the wreck of human joy,
    Let kneeling faith adore Thy will.

  1 The darkened sky, how thick it lowers!
    Troubled with storms, and big with showers,
    No cheerful gleam of light appears,
    But nature pours forth all her tears.

  2 Yet let the sons of God revive;
    He bids the soul that seeks Him live,
    And from the gloomiest shade of night
    Calls forth a morning of delight.

  3 The seeds of ecstasy unknown
    Are in these watered furrows sown;
    See the green blades, how thick they rise,
    And with fresh verdure bless our eyes!

  4 In secret foldings they contain
    Unnumbered ears of golden grain;
    And heaven shall pour its beams around,
    Till the ripe harvest load the ground.

  5 Then shall the trembling mourner come,
    And bind his sheaves, and bear them home,
    The voice long broke with sighs shall sing,
    Till heaven with hallelujahs ring.

  2 But deem her not a child of earth;
    From heaven she draws her sacred birth;
    Beside the throne of God she stands
    To execute his kind commands.

  3 The messenger of love, she flies
    To train us for our sphere, the skies;
    And onward as we move, the way

    Her looks with kindling radiance burn;
    And from her lips these accents steal,--
    "God smites to bless, he wounds to heal!"

    Over my soul the waves of agony
    Have gone, and left me in a rayless night.

  2 A bruised and broken reed sustain! sustain!
    Divinest Comforter, to Thee I fly,
    To whom no soul hath ever fled in vain;
    Support me with thy love, or else I die.

  3 Father, what'er I had, it all was thine;
    A God of mercy Thou hast ever been;
    O, help me what I most loved to resign,
    And if I murmur, count it not for sin.

  4 My soul is strengthened now, and it shall bear
    All that remains, whatever it may be;
    And from the very depths of my despair
    I will look up, O God, and trust in Thee!

      Could we but read aright:
    O pilgrim! lift in hope thy head,
      At eve it shall be light!

  2 Though earth-born shadows now may shroud
      Our toilsome path a while,
    God's blessed word can part each cloud,
      And bid the sunshine smile.
    If we but trust in living faith,
      His love and power divine,
    Then, though our sun may set in death,
      His light shall round us shine.

  3 When tempest-clouds are dark on high,
      His bow of love and peace
    Shines beauteous in the vaulted sky,
      Token that storms shall cease.
    Then keep we on, with hope unchilled,
      By faith and not by sight,
    And we shall own his word fulfilled,--
      "At eve it shall be light."

    We'll meet the tempest at Thy word,
      And walk upon the sea.

  2 Poor tremblers at His rougher wind,
      Why do we doubt Him so?
    Who gives the storms a path will find
      The way our feet shall go.

  3 A moment may His hand seem lost,
      Drear moment of delay;--
    We cry, "Lord, help the tempest-tost!"
      And safe we're borne away.

  4 O happy soul, of faith divine!
      Thy victory how sure!
    The love that kindles joy is thine,

      Which, like the trembling dove,
      No resting-place can find
    On the wild waters,--God of light,
    Through the thick darkness lead me right!

  2   Bid the fierce conflict cease,
      And fear and anguish fly;
      Let there again be peace,
      As in the days gone by:
    In Jesus' name I cry to Thee,
    Remembering Gethsemane.

  3   Fain would earth's true and dear
      Save me in this dark hour;
      And art not Thou more near?
      Art Thou not love and power?

    Canst send deliverance even now.

  4   Though through the future's shade
      Pale phantoms I descry,
      Let me not shrink dismayed,
      But ever feel Thee nigh;
    There may be grief, and pain, and care
    But, O my Father! Thou art there.

  1 In trouble and in grief, O God,
      Thy smile hath cheered my way;
    And joy hath budded from each thorn
      That round my footsteps lay.

  2 The hours of pain have yielded good
      Which prosperous days refused;
    As herbs, though scentless when entire,
      Spread fragrance when they're bruised.

  3 The oak strikes deeper as its boughs
      By furious blasts are driven;
    So life's tempestuous storms the more
      Have fixed my heart in heaven.

  4 All gracious Lord! whate'er my lot
      In other times may be,
    I'll welcome still the heaviest grief
      That brings me near to Thee.

    Strong is His arm, the God of thy salvation,
      Strong is His love to cheer and comfort thee.

  2 Cold though the world be, in the way before thee
      Wail not in sadness o'er the darkling tomb;
    God in His love still watcheth kindly o'er thee,
      Light shineth still above the clouds of gloom.

  3 Dimmed though thine eyes be with the tears of sorrow
      Night only known beneath the sky of time,
    Faith can behold the dawning of a morrow
      Glowing in smiles of life and joy sublime.

  4 Change, then, O mourner, grief to exultation;
      Firm and confiding should thy spirit be;
    Strong is His arm, the God of thy salvation,
      Strong is His love to cheer and comfort thee.

  1 Father! who in the olive shade,
      When the dark hour came on,
    Didst, with a breath of heavenly aid,
        Strengthen thy Son;

  2 O, in the anguish of our night,
      Send us down blest relief;
    And to the chastened, let Thy might
        Hallow the grief!

  3 And thou, that, when the starry sky
      Saw the dread strife begun,
    Didst teach adoring faith to cry,
        "Thy will be done!"--

  4 By thy meek spirit, thou, of all
      That e'er have mourned the chief,
    Our Saviour! when the stroke doth fall,
        Hallow our grief!

                          The Angels of Grief.


  1 With silence only as their benediction,
          God's angels come
    Where, in the shadow of a great affliction,
          The soul sits dumb.

  2 Yet would we say, what every heart approveth,--
          Our Father's will,
    Calling to Him the dear ones whom he loveth,
          Is mercy still.

  3 Not upon us or ours the solemn angel
          Hath evil wrought;
    The funeral anthem is a glad evangel;
          The good die not!

  4 God calls our loved ones, but we lose not wholly
          What He has given;
    They live on earth in thought and deed, as truly
          As in His heaven.

  1 O, not when the death-prayer is said,
      The life of life departs;
    The body in the grave is laid,
      Its beauty in our hearts.

  2 At holy midnight, voices sweet,
      Like fragrance, fill the room;
    And happy ghosts, with noiseless feet,
      Come brightening through the gloom.

  3 We know who sends the visions bright,
      From whose dear side they came;
    We veil our eyes before Thy light,
      We bless our Father's name!

  4 This frame, O God, this feeble breath,
      Thy hand may soon destroy;
    We think of Thee, and feel in death
      A deep and holy joy.

  5 Dim is the light of vanished years
      In glory yet to come;
    O idle grief, O foolish tears,
      When Jesus calls us home!

  1 Lowly and solemn be
    Thy children's cry to Thee,
        Father divine!
    A hymn of suppliant breath,
    Owning that life and death
        Alike are Thine.

  2 O Father, in that hour
    When earth all helping power
        Shall disavow;
    When spear, and shield, and crown,
    In faintness are cast down,
        Sustain us Thou!

  3 By him who bowed to take
    The death-cup for our sake,
        The thorn, the rod;
    From whom the last dismay
    Was not to pass away,
        Aid us, O God!

  4 And now beside the grave,
    We call on Thee to save,
        Father divine!
    Hear, hear our suppliant breath;
    Keep us, in life and death,
        Thine, only Thine!

                             Life in Death.


  1 Thanks, thanks unto God! who in mercy hath spoken
      The truths which have pierced through the spirit's sad gloom;
    Whose love with the light of its presence hath broken
      The darkness which hung o'er the desolate tomb.

  2 What now shall affright us? A Father almighty
      Keeps watch round our footsteps wherever we go;
    His mercy is sleepless,--His wisdom unfailing,--
      He knoweth each want and regardeth each woe.

  3 Where now is death's terror? he comes as an angel
      To carry the spirit away to its rest;
    The gloom which he weareth is lost in the message
      He brings from the Being who loveth us best.

  4 May we live ever true to the hopes He hath given,
      While they shed o'er our path a still holier light;
    Ever making us nearer and nearer to heaven,
      More pure our affections, our spirits more bright.

                           O, Stay Thy Tears!


  1 O, stay thy tears! for they are blest
    Whose days are past, whose toil is done;
    Here midnight care disturbs our rest,
    Here sorrow dims the morning sun.

  2 For laboring virtue's anxious toil,
    For patient sorrow's stifled sigh,
    For faith that marks the conqueror's spoil,
    Heaven grants the recompense,--to die.

  3 How blest are they whose transient years
    Pass like an evening meteor's flight,
    Not dark with guilt, nor dim with tears,
    Whose course is short, unclouded, bright!

  4 O, cheerless were our lengthened way,
    But heaven's own light dispels the gloom,
    Streams downward from eternal day,
    And sheds a glory round the tomb!

  5 Then stay thy tears,--the blest above
    Have hailed a spirit's heavenly birth,
    Sung a new song of joy and love;
    Then why should anguish reign on earth?

  1 The mourners came, at break of day,
    Unto the garden sepulchre,
    With saddened hearts to weep and pray
    For him, the loved one, buried there.
    What radiant light dispels the gloom?
    An angel sits beside the tomb.

  2 The earth doth mourn her treasures lost,
    All sepulchred beneath the snow,
    When wintry winds and chilling frost
    Have laid her summer glories low;
    The spring returns, the flow'rets bloom,--
    An angel sits beside the tomb.

  3 Then mourn we not beloved dead,
    E'en while we come to weep and pray;
    The happy spirit hath but fled
    To brighter realms of heavenly day;
    Immortal hope dispels the gloom;--
    An angel sits beside the tomb.

      Deeds of peace and love,
    Now are stars of glory strewn,

  1   Where is thy sting, O death?
      Grave! where thy victory?
    The clod may sleep in dust beneath,
      The spirit will be free!

  2   Both man and time have power
      O'er suffering, dying men;
    But death arrives, and in that hour
      The soul is freed again.

  3   Then, death, where is thy sting?
      And where thy victory, grave?
    O'er your dark bourn the soul will spring
      To Him who loves to save.

    How mildly beam the closing eyes,
    How gently heaves the expiring breast!

    So sinks the gale when storms are o'er;
    So gently shuts the eye of day;
    So dies a wave along the shore.

  3 A holy quiet reigns around,
    A calm which life nor death destroys;
    And naught disturbs that peace profound
    Which his unfettered soul enjoys.

  4 Farewell, conflicting hopes and fears,
    Where lights and shades alternate dwell!
    How bright the unchanging morn appears!
    Farewell, inconstant world, farewell!

  5 Life's duty done, as sinks the clay,
    Light from its load the spirit flies;
    While guardian angels gently say,

      We feel, in hours serene,
    Connected with a world above,

    A rest for the bereaved and broken-hearted,
      A house not made with hands, a home on high;
    Holy monitions,--a mysterious breath,--
    A whisper from the marble halls of death.

  2 They have gone from us, and the grave is strong,
      Yet in night's silent watches they are near;
    Their voices linger round us, as the song
      Of the sweet bird that lingers on the ear,
    When, floating upward in the flush of even,
    Its form is lost from earth and swallowed up in heaven.

  1 How dear is the thought, that the angels of God
    May bow their bright wings to the world they once trod;
    Will leave the sweet songs of the mansions above,
    To breathe o'er our bosoms some message of love!

  2 They come, on the wings of the morning they come,
    Impatient to lead some poor wanderer home;
    Some sinner to save from his darkened abode,
    And lay him to rest in the arms of his God.

  3 They come when we wander, they come when we pray,
    In mercy to guard us wherever we stray;
    A glorious cloud, their bright witness is given;
    Encircling us here are these angels of heaven.

    And but a step doth lie between
      That world of souls and me.

  2 I see no light, I hear no sound,
      When midnight shades are spread;
    Yet angels pitch their tents around,
      And guard my quiet bed.

  3 The things unseen, O God, reveal;
      My spirit's vision clear,
    Till I shall feel, and see, and know,
      That those I love are near.

  4 Impart the faith that soars on high,
      Beyond this earthly strife;
    That holds sweet converse with the sky,
      And lives eternal life.

  1 Brother, the angels say,
      Peace to thy heart!
    We, too, O brother, have
      Been as thou art,--
    Hope-lifted, doubt-depressed,
      Seeing in part,
    Tried, troubled, tempted,
      Sustained, as thou art.

  2 Brother, they softly say,
      Be our thoughts one;
    Bend thou with us and pray,
      "Thy will be done!"
    Our God is thy God;
      He willeth the best;
    Trust Him as we trusted--
      Rest as we rest!

  3 Ye, too, they gently say,
      Shall angels be;
    Ye, too, O brothers,
      From earth shall be free:
    Yet in earth's loved ones
      Ye still shall have part,
    Bearing God's strength and love
      To the torn heart.

      Tempted and worn,
    Finding no earthly aid,

    And on the troubled heart
      Steals a deep calm.

      Along the radiant shore;
    The soul, now wandering here, shall know
      Its burning thirst no more.

  3 The burden of the stranger's heart,
      Which here unknown we bear,
    Like the night-shadow shall depart
      With our first wakening there.

  4 And, borne on eagle's wings afar,
      Free thought shall claim its dower,
    From every sphere, from every star,
      Of glory and of power.

  4 To thousand tasks of fruitful hope,
    With skill against his toil, he bends,
    And finds his work's determined scope
          Where'er he wends.

  5 From earth and earthly toil and strife
    To deathless aims his soul may rise,
    Each dawn may wake to better life,
          With purer eyes.

  6 Such grace from Thee, O God, be ours,
    Renewed with every morning's ray,
    And freshening still with added flowers
          Each future day.

  7 To man is given one primal star;
    One dayspring's beam has dawned below;
    From Thine our inmost glories are,
          With Thine we glow.

  8 Like earth awake and warm and bright,
    With joy the spirit moves and burns;
    So up to Thee, O Fount of Light,
          Our light returns.

  1 Now the shades of night are gone;
    Now the morning light is come:
    Lord, may we be Thine to-day;
    Drive the shades of sin away.

  2 Fill our souls with heavenly light,
    Banish doubt, and clear our sight;
    In Thy service, Lord, to-day,
    May we stand, and watch, and pray.

  3 Keep our haughty passions bound;
    Save us from our foes around;
    Going out and coming in,
    Keep us safe from every sin.

  1 In the morning I will pray
    For God's blessing on the day;
    What this day shall be my lot,
    Light or darkness, know I not.

  2 Should it be with clouds o'ercast,
    Clouds of sorrow, gathering fast,
    Thou, who givest light divine,
    Shine within me, Lord, O, shine!

  3 Show me, if I tempted be,
    How to find all strength in Thee,
    And a perfect triumph win
    Over every bosom sin.

  4 Keep my feet from secret snares,
    Keep mine eyes, O God, from tears!
    Every step Thy love attend,
    And my soul from death defend!

  1 Now that the sun is beaming bright,
      Implore we, bending low,
    That He, the uncreated Light,
      May guide us as we go.

  2 No sinful word, nor deed of wrong,
      Nor thoughts that idly rove,
    But simple truth be on our tongue,
      And in our hearts be love.

  3 And while the hours in order flow,
      Securely keep, O God,
    Our hearts, beleaguered by the foe
      That tempts our every road.

  4 And grant that to Thine honor, Lord,
      Our daily toil may tend;
    That we begin it at Thy word,
      And in Thy favor end.

  1 O God! I thank Thee that the night
    In peace and rest hath passed away,
    And that I see in this fair light
    My Father's smile, that makes it day.

  2 Be Thou my guide, and let me live
    As under Thine all-seeing eye;
    Supply my wants, my sins forgive,
    And make me happy when I die.

  1 Source of light and life divine!
    Thou didst cause the light to shine;
    Thou didst bring Thy sunbeams forth
    O'er Thy new-created earth.

  2 Shade of night and morning ray
    Took from Thee the name of day:
    Now again the shades are nigh,
    Listen to Thy children's cry!

  3 May we ne'er, by guilt depressed,
    Lose the way to endless rest;
    May no thoughts, corrupt and vain,
    Draw our souls to earth again.

  4 Rather help them still to rise
    Where our dearest treasure lies;
    Help us in our daily strife,
    Make us struggle into life!

  1 Up to the throne of God is borne
    The voice of praise at early morn,
    And He accepts the reverent hymn
    Sung as the light of day grows dim.

  2 Look up to heaven! the obedient sun
    Already through his course hath run;
    He cannot halt or go astray,
    But our immortal spirits may.

  3 Lord, since his rising in the east,
    If we have faltered or transgressed,
    Guide, from Thy love's abundant source,
    What yet remains of this day's course.

  4 Help with Thy grace, through all life's day,
    Our upward and our downward way;
    And glorify for us the west,
    When we shall sink into our rest.

  1   Fading, still fading, the last beam is shining;
      Father in heaven! the day is declining;
      Safety and innocence flee with the light,
      Temptation and danger walk forth with the night;
      From the fall of the shade till the morning bells chime,
      Shield us from danger and keep us from crime!
    Father! have mercy, through Jesus Christ our Lord! Amen!

  2   Father in heaven! O, hear, when we call,
      Through Jesus Christ, who is Saviour of all!
      Fainting and feeble, we trust in Thy might;
      In doubting and darkness Thy love be our light!
      Let us sleep on Thy breast while the night taper burns,
      And wake in Thy arms when the morning returns.
    Father! have mercy, through Jesus Christ our Lord! Amen!

    Is the working of His will!

  2 Mighty spirit, ever nigh!
    Work in me as silently;
    Veil the day's distracting sights,
    Show me heaven's eternal lights.

  3 Living stars to view be brought
    In the boundless realms of thought;
    High and infinite desires,
    Flaming like those upper fires!

  4 Holy Truth, Eternal Right,
    Let them break upon my sight;
    Let them shine serene and still,
    And with light my being fill.

  1 Another day its course hath run,
    And still, O God! Thy child is blest;
    For Thou hast been by day my sun,
    And Thou wilt be by night my rest.

  2 Sweet sleep descends, mine eyes to close;
    And now, while all the world is still,
    I give my body to repose,
    My spirit to my Father's will.

  1 Lord of the Sabbath, hear our vows,
    On this Thy day, in this Thy house;
    And own, as grateful sacrifice,
    The songs which from Thy churches rise.

  2 Thine earthly Sabbaths, Lord, we love;
    But there's a nobler rest above;
    To that our longing souls aspire,
    With earnest hope and strong desire.

  3 No more fatigue, no more distress;
    Nor sin nor death shall reach the place;
    No groans to mingle with the songs
    Which warble from immortal tongues.

  4 No rude alarms of raging foes;
    No cares to break the long repose;
    No midnight shade, no clouded sun,
    But sacred, high, eternal noon.

  5 O long expected day, begin;
    Dawn on these realms of woe and sin!
    Fain would we leave this weary road,
    And pass through death, to rest with God.

  1 How sweet, how calm, this Sabbath morn!
      How pure the air that breathes!
    How soft the sounds upon it borne!
      How light its vapor wreathes!

  2 It seems as if the Christian's prayer,
      For peace and joy and love,
    Were answered by the very air
      That wafts its strain above.

  3 Let each unholy passion cease,
      Each evil thought be crushed,
    And every care that mars our peace
      In Faith and Love be hushed.

                            Sabbath Evening.


  1 Within Thy courts have millions met,
    Millions this day before Thee bowed;
    Their faces heavenward were set,
    Their vows to Thee, O God! they vowed.

  2 Still as the light of morning broke
    O'er island, continent, and deep,
    Thy far-spread family awoke,
    Sabbath all round the world to keep.

  3 From east to west the sun surveyed,
    From north to south, adoring throngs;
    And still where evening stretched her shade
    The stars came forth to hear their songs.

  4 And not a prayer, a tear, a sigh,
    Hath failed this day some suit to gain;
    To hearts that sought Thee Thou wast nigh
    Nor hath one sought Thy face in vain.

  5 The poor in spirit Thou hast fed,
    The feeble soul hath strengthened been.
    The mourner Thou hast comforted,
    The pure in heart their God have seen.

  6 And Thou, soul-searching God! hast known
    The hearts of all that bent the knee,
    And all their prayers have reached Thy throne,
    In soul and truth who worshipped Thee.

      Came forth the Sinless One,
    A voice athwart the heavens flashed,
      "Lo! my beloved son!"

  2 The Baptist, gazing on his face,
      With the soul's radiance bright,
    Beheld upon his sacred head
      A snow-white dove alight.

  3 Now with baptismal waters touched,
      Thy children, Father, see!
    While heart and soul, and mind and strength,
      They consecrate to Thee.

  4 Send down on them Thy holy dove,
      Thy spirit undefiled;
    Be each in purity and faith
      Thy well-beloved child!

  5 O help them in the wilderness
      To conquer doubt and sin;
    To see above them still Thy Peace,
      And hear Thy voice within!

  1 This child we dedicate to Thee,
    O God of grace and purity!
    Shield it from sin and threatening wrong,
    And let Thy love its life prolong.

  2 O, may Thy spirit gently draw
    Its willing soul to keep Thy law;
    May virtue, piety, and truth,
    Dawn even with its dawning youth!

  3 We, too, before Thy gracious sight,
    Once shared the blest baptismal rite,
    And would renew its solemn vow,
    With love, and thanks, and praises, now.

  4 Grant that, with true and faithful heart,
    We still may act the Christian's part,
    Cheered by each promise Thou hast given,
    And laboring for the prize in heaven.

  1   To Thee, O God in heaven,
      This little one we bring,
    Giving to Thee what Thou hast given,
      Our dearest offering.

  2   Into a world of toil
      These little feet will roam,
    Where sin its purity may soil,
      Where care and grief may come.

  3   O, then, let Thy pure love,
      With influence serene,
    Come down, like water, from above,
      To comfort and make clean!

      We bring these children home.

  2   To Thee, O God, whose face
      Their spirits still behold,
    We bring them, praying that Thy grace
      May keep, Thine arms enfold.

  3   And as this water falls
      On each unconscious brow,
    Thy holy spirit grant, O Lord,
      To keep them pure as now!

    On those who now the bands have twined,

  2 We know that scenes not always bright
      Must unto them be given;
    But let there shine o'er all the light
      Of love, and truth, and heaven.

  3 Still hand in hand, their journey through,
      Meek pilgrims may they go;
    Mingling their joys as helpers true,
      And sharing every woe.

  4 In faith, and trust, and heart, the same,
      The same their home above;
    May each in each still feed the flame
      Of pure and holy love.

  1 Father, in Thy presence now
    Has been pledged the nuptial vow;
    Heart to heart, as hand in hand,
    Linked in one Thy children stand.

  2 God of love! this union bless,
    Not with earth's low happiness;
    But with joys whose heavenly spring
    Shall diviner raptures bring.

  3 May these blended souls be found
    Firm in duty's active round;
    Daily every burden share,
    Nightly seek Thy shadowing care.

  4 When against their trembling forms
    Shoot the arrows of life's storms;
    Or when age and sickness wait
    Heralds at life's parting gate;--

  5 In the fulness of belief,
    May they look beyond the grief;
    And together fearless tread
    In the path where Thou shall lead.

  1 Where ancient forests widely spread,
    Where bends the cataract's ocean-fall;
    On the lone mountain's silent head,
    There are Thy temples, God of all!

  2 The tombs Thine altars are; for there,
    When earthly loves and hopes have fled,
    To Thee ascends the spirit's prayer,
    Thou God of the immortal dead!

  3 All space is holy, for all space
    Is filled by Thee;--but human thought
    Burns clearer in some chosen place,
    Where Thine own words of love are taught.

  4 Here be they taught; and may we know
    That faith Thy servants knew of old,
    Which onward bears, through weal or woe,
    Till death the gates of heaven unfold.

  5 Nor we alone; may those whose brow
    Shows yet no trace of human cares
    Hereafter stand where we do now,
    And raise to Thee still holier prayers.

      Within these courts to bide,
    The peace that dwelleth, without end,
      Serenely by Thy side!

  3 May erring minds that worship here
      Be taught the better way;
    And they who mourn, and they who fear,
      Be strengthened as they pray.

  4 May faith grow firm, and love grow warm,
      And pure devotion rise,
    While round these hallowed walls the storm
      Of earth-born passion dies.

  1 O God! Thy children, gathered here,
      Thy blessing now we wait;
    Thy servant, girded for his work,
      Stands at the temple's gate.

  2 A holy purpose in his heart
      Has deepened calm and still;
    Now from his childhood's Nazareth
      He comes, to do Thy will.

  3 O Father! keep his soul alive
      To every hope of good;
    And may his life of love proclaim
      Man's truest brotherhood!

  4 O Father! keep his spirit quick
      To every form of wrong;
    And in the ear of sin and self
      May his rebuke be strong!

  5 And as he doth Christ's footsteps press,
      If e'er his faith grow dim,
    Then, in the dreary wilderness,
      Thine angels strengthen him!

  6 And give him in Thy holy work
      Patience to wait Thy time,
    And, toiling still with man, to breathe
      The soul's serener clime.

  7 O grant him many hearts to lead
      Into Thy perfect rest;
    Bless Thou him, Father, and his flock:
      Bless! and they shall be blest!

      Be hate unthought, unspoken;
    Bind up the bleeding heart, nor let
      The bruised reed be broken.

  3 If any scorn you for the truth
      Which ye shall publish free,
    Think of the lonely midnight hour
      In dark Gethsemane:

  4 Think of my prayers on Olivet,
      My musings by the sea;
    And though the heavy chain may bind,
      That truth shall make you free.

  1 Thy servant's sandals, Lord, are wet
    With Jordan's wave but lately met,
    And in that sacred river fall
    The olden thoughts, the spirit's pall.

  2 He stands upon the holy land,
    And angels take his trustful hand;
    The Jordan sanctifies his breast,
    And Christ now leads him to his rest.

  3 His rest? his battle! he must win
    Fair Zion's gate through ranks of sin;
    Why are these words, this solemn show,
    If sin be not his deadly foe?

  4 There gathers here no heavenly host;
    No fiery tongues of Pentecost,--
    No gentle dove with winnowing wings
    The spirit to thy servant brings.

  5 The still, small voice hath called him here,
    And thus is God himself most near:--
    My people, lift your hearts in prayer,
    And keep your God forever there.

      The sacred fast I choose:
    Oppression's yoke to burst in twain,
      The bands of guilt unloose?

  3   "To nakedness and want
      Your food and raiment deal,
    To dwell your kindred race among,
      And all their sufferings heal?

      Shall spring your health and light;
    Before you, righteousness shall shine,
      Around, my glory bright!"

  1 O Thou, whose power stupendous

    Thy grace preserving send us,--
      To Thee, O Lord! we cry.

  2 From wilds of fearful error,
      Wherein we darkly stray,
    Oppressed with doubt and terror,
      For saving aid we pray.

  3 O God of mercy, hear us!
      Our pain, our sorrow, see;
    Thy healing pity spare us,
      And bring us home to Thee!

  1 Joy! joy! a year is born;
    A year to man is given,
    For hope, and peace, and love,
    For faith, and truth, and heaven.
    Though earth be dark with care,
    With death and sorrow rife,
    Yet toil, and pain, and prayer,
    Lead to our higher life.

  2 Behold, the fields are white!
    No longer idly stand!
    Go forth in love and might;
    Man needs thy helping hand.
    Thus may each day and year
    To prayer and toil be given,
    Till man to God draw near,
    And earth become like heaven.

  1 Our Father! through the coming year
      We know not what shall be,
    But we would leave without a fear
      Its ordering all to Thee.

  2 It may be we shall toil in vain
      For what the world holds fair,
    And all its good we thought to gain
      Deceive, and prove but care.

  3 It may be it shall darkly blend
      Our love with anxious fears,
    And snatch away the valued friend,
      The tried of many years.

  4 It may be it shall bring us days
      And nights of lingering pain,
    And bid us take our farewell gaze
      Of these loved haunts of men.

  5 But calmly, Lord, on Thee we rest;
      No fears our trust shall move;
    Thou knowest what for each is best,
      And Thou art perfect love.

    All ye soft-descending showers:
    Praise, with each awakening thing,
    Praise your Maker,--God of spring!

  3 Praise him, man!--thy fitful heart

    To employ its noblest part,
    Softest mercy, sweetest love,--
    Blessing, with each living thing,

    And flowers and fruits foretelling,
      With fragrant beauty fraught.

  2 'Tis this which calls Thy children
      In sweet accord to raise,
    Beneath thy blue-domed temple,

      And cloud's refreshing shower,--
    O God, our Heavenly Father,
      All, all, proclaim Thy power.

      Come so fragrant from the flowers!
    Praise, thou willow by the brookside!
      Praise, ye birds, among the bowers!

  3 Praise the Lord! and may His blessing
      Guide us in the way of truth,
    Keep our feet from paths of error,
      Make us holy in our youth.

  4 Praise the Lord, ye hosts of heaven!
      Angels, sing your sweetest lays!
    All things utter forth His glory!
      Sound your great Creator's praise!

      Wreaths the gay world with flowers,
    And trees bend down with golden fruit,
      And birds are in their bowers!

  2 The morn sends silent music down
      Upon each earthly thing;
    And always since creation's dawn
      The stars together sing.

  3 Shall man remain in silence, then,
      While all beneath the skies
    The chorus joins? no, let us sing,
      And while our voices rise,

  4 O, let our lives, great God, breathe forth
      A constant melody;
    And every action be a tone
      In that sweet hymn to Thee!

    Shines, in her bridal vesture clad,
      And crowned with festal flowers,
    So radiantly beautiful,
      So like to heaven above,
    We scarce can deem more fair that world
      Of perfect bliss and love.

  2 Is this a shadow faint and dim
      Of that which is to come!
    What shall the unveiled splendor be
      Of our celestial home,

      Where streams of bliss gush free,
    And all is glowing in the light
      Of immortality!

    The rolling seasons, as they move,
      Proclaim Thy constant care.

  2 When in the bosom of the earth
      The sower hid the grain,
    Thy goodness marked its secret birth,
      And sent the early rain.

  3 The spring's sweet influence, Lord, was Thine,
      Its mild, refreshing showers;
    Thou gav'st the ripening suns to shine,
      And summer's golden hours.

  4 Thy quickening life, forever near,
      Matured the swelling grain;--
    The bounteous harvest crowns the year,

  1   House of our God, with cheerful anthems ring,

    The Lord is good, His mercy never-ending,
    His blessings in perpetual showers descending.

  2   The earth, enlightened by His rays divine,
      Brought forth the grass, the corn, and oil, and wine;
      Crowned with His goodness, let the people meet,
      And lay their thankful offerings at his feet;
    With grateful love that hand divine confessing,
    Which on each heart bestoweth every blessing.

  3   His mercy never ends; the dawn, the shade,
      Still see new beauties through new scenes displayed;
      Succeeding ages bless this sure abode,
      And children lean upon their fathers' God:
    The soul of man, through its immense duration,
    Drinks from this source immortal consolation.

  4   Burst into praise, my soul! all nature, join!
      Angels and men, in harmony combine!
      While human years are measured by the sun,
      And while eternity its course shall run,
    His goodness, in perpetual showers descending,
    Exalt in songs and raptures never-ending!

    And its sweet treasures, day by day,
    Rose quickening in Thy blessed ray.

    The land with sunlight and with showers;
    And plenty o'er its bosom smiles,
    To crown the sweet autumnal hours.

  4 Praise, praise to Thee! Our hearts expand,
    To view these blessings of Thy hand,
    And on the incense-breath of love
    Ascend to their bright home above.

    Her Autumn brings its golden fruits,
      In glorious luxury given;
    While Winter's silver heights reflect
      Thy brightness back to heaven.

  2 Thine are the beams that cheer us on our way,

    Thine is the night, and the fair orbs that shine

  3 If round our path the thorns of sorrow grew,
    And mortal friends were faithless, Thou wast true
    Did sickness shake the frame, or anguish tear
    The wounded spirit, Thou wast present there.

  4 O, lend Thine ear, and lift our voice to Thee;
    Where'er we dwell, still let Thy mercy be;
    From year to year, still nearer to Thy shrine
    Draw our frail hearts, and make them wholly Thine!

  2 Of every breath, and every power,
      Thou wast the gracious source;
    From Thee came every happy hour
      Which smiled along its course.

  3 And if sometimes across our path
      A cloud its shadows threw,
    Thou didst not waft it there in wrath,
      But loving-kindness true.

      Our thanks to Thee above;
    And only pray to grow each day
      More worthy of Thy love.

    From the burden of the flesh,
      And from care and fear, released,
    Where the wicked cease from troubling,
      And the weary are at rest.

  2 Sin no more can taint thy spirit,
      Nor can doubt thy faith assail;
    Thy soul its welcome has received,
      Thy strength shall never fail;
    And thou'rt sure to meet the good,
      Whom on earth thou lovedst best,
    Where the wicked cease from troubling,
      And the weary are at rest.

  3 To the grave thy body bearing,
      Low we place it mid the dead;
    And lay the turf above it now,
      And seal its narrow bed;
    But thy spirit soars away,
      Free, among the faithful blest,
    Where the wicked cease from troubling
      And the weary are at rest.

      The changing of her sphere,
    To give to heaven a shining one,
      Who walked an angel here.

  3 Unto our Father's will alone
      One thought hath reconciled;
    That He whose love exceedeth ours
      Hath taken home his child.

  4 Fold her, O Father, in thine arms,
      And let her henceforth be
    A messenger of love between
      Our human hearts and Thee.

      Between us and the wrong,
    And her dear memory serve to make
      Our faith in goodness strong.

  1 Clay to clay, and dust to dust!
    Let them mingle,--for they must!
    Give to earth the earthly clod,

    Darken round this mortal lamp;
    Never more shall noonday's glance
    Search this mortal countenance.

    Death cannot the soul imprison:
    'Tis in heaven that spirits dwell,

    There shall those we love be found,
    Tracing life's eternal round.

    One thought shall check the starting tear,--
      It is--that thou art free.

  2 And thus shall faith's consoling power
      The tears of love restrain;
    O, who that saw thy parting hour
      Could wish thee here again?

      Sustained by grace divine;
    O, may such grace on us be shed,

    Rest on thy sheaves, thy harvest work is done;

    Soldier, go home; with thee the field is won.

  3 Go to the grave, for there thy Saviour lay,
    In death's embraces, ere he rose on high;
    And all the ransomed, by that narrow way,
    Pass to eternal life beyond the sky.

  4 Go to the grave,--no, to thy home above;
    Be thy pure spirit present with the Lord,
    Where thou for faith and hope hast perfect love,
    And open vision for the written word.

      And the lamp of his love is thy guide through the gloom.

  2 Thou art gone to the grave: we no longer behold thee,
      Nor tread the rough paths of the world by thy side;
    But the wide arms of mercy are spread to enfold thee,
      And sinners may hope, since the Sinless hath died.

  3 Thou art gone to the grave; and, its mansion forsaking,
      Perchance thy tried spirit in doubt lingered long;
    But the sunshine of heaven beamed bright on thy waking,
      And the song that thou heard'st was the seraphim's song.

  4 Thou art gone to the grave; but we will not deplore thee,
      Since God was thy refuge, thy guardian, thy guide;
    He gave thee, He took thee, and He will restore thee;
      And death has no sting, since the Saviour hath died.

  1 Calm on the bosom of thy God,
      Fair spirit, rest thee now!
    E'en while with us thy footstep trod,
      His seal was on thy brow.

  2 Dust, to its narrow house beneath!
      Soul, to its home on high!
    They that have seen thy look in death
      No more may fear to die.

  3 Lone are the paths, and sad the hours,
      Since thy meek spirit's gone;
    But, O, a brighter home than ours,
      In heaven, is now thine own!

  1 Fare thee well, our fondly cherished!
      Dear, dear blossom, fare thee well!
    He who lent thee hath recalled thee,
      Back with Him and His to dwell.

  2 Like a sunbeam through our dwelling
      Shone thy presence, bright and calm;
    Thou didst add a zest to pleasure;
      To our sorrows thou wast balm.

  3 Yet while mourning, O our lost one,
      Come no visions of despair!
    Seated on thy tomb, Faith's angel
      Saith, thou art not, art not there.

  4 Where, then, art thou? with the Saviour,
      Blest, forever blest, to be;
    'Mid the sinless little children
      Who have heard his "Come to me."

  5 Passed the shades of death's dark valley,
      Thou art leaning on his breast,
    Where the wicked may not enter,
      And the weary are at rest.

  6 Plead, that in a Father's mercy
      All our sins may be forgiven;
    Angel! plead, that thou may'st greet us,
      Ransomed, at the gates of heaven.

  1 To the Father's love we trust
    That which was enshrined in dust;
    While we give the earth to earth,
    Finds the soul its heavenly birth.
    Angels wait the angel child,
    Gentle, young, and undefiled.

  2 Said not oft those pleading eyes
    That they longed for purer skies?
    Did not oft the falling tear
    Speak of roughening billows here?
    Prayed we not that she might rest
    On her Heavenly Father's breast?

  3 Give the spirit, then, to God,
    And its vesture to the sod;
    Life, henceforth, shall have a ray
    Kindled ne'er to pass away,
    And a light from angel eyes
    Draw us upward to the skies.

    By life's clear river dwelling,
      Amid undying flowers,--
    There hosts of beauteous spirits,
      Fair children of the earth,
    Linked in bright bands celestial,
      Sing of their human birth.

  2 They sing of earth and heaven,--
      Divinest voices rise
    To God, their gracious Father,
      Who called them to the skies:
    They all are there,--in heaven,--
      Safe, safe, and sweetly blest;
    No cloud of sin can shadow
      Their bright and holy rest.

  1 Mighty One, whose name is holy,
      Thou wilt save Thy work alive,
    And the spirit of the lowly
      Thou wilt visit and revive.
    What Thy prophets thus have spoken,
      Ages witness as they roll;
    Bleeding hearts and spirits broken,
      Touched by Thee, O God, are whole.

  2 By Thy pitying spirit guided,
      Jesus sought the sufferer's door;
    Comfort for the poor provided,
      And the mourner's sorrows bore;--
    So Thy mercy's angel, bending,
      Heard a friendless prisoner's call,
    And through night's cold vault descending,
      Loosed from chains Thy servant Paul.

  3 Father, as Thy love is endless,
      Working by Thy servants thus,
    The forsaken and the friendless
      Deign to visit, e'en by us;
    So shall each, with spirit fervent
      Laboring with Thee here below,
    Be declared Thy faithful servant,
      Where there's neither want nor woe.

    They call us to deliver
      Their land from error's chain.

    The heathen in his blindness
      Bows down to wood and stone.

  3 Shall we, whose souls are lighted
      By wisdom from on high,
    Shall we to men benighted
      The lamp of life deny?
    Salvation! O salvation!
      The joyful sound proclaim,
    Till earth's remotest nation
      Shall learn Messiah's name.

        Pour from His hand;

  2 Where sleep in rest profound,
    Beneath each ancient mound,

    There, brother, go and teach;
    From heart to heart shall reach
    Thy free and earnest speech
        Of heavenly grace.

  3 Where the tall forest waves
    Above those mouldering graves,
        God's truth declare;
    While his first temples spread
    Their arches o'er thy head,
    Lift, o'er the slumbering dead,
        The voice of prayer.

  4 While rolls the living tide,
    Down Alleghany's side,
        Its ceaseless flood;
    Upon the mountains, there,
    How beautiful appear
    The feet of those who bear
        Tidings of good!

  5 O Thou, whose suns and rains
    Upon those mighty plains
        Fall evermore;
    Send down the dews of peace,

    And let Thy light increase

      Westward, still, its light be poured!
    Heathen Thy possession making,
      Utmost lands Thy dwelling, Lord!

  2 Westward, where the waving prairie,
      Dark as slumbering ocean, lies,
    Let thy starlight, Son of Mary,
      O'er the shadowed billows rise!
    Here be heard, ye herald voices,
      Till the Lord his glory shows,
    And the lonely place rejoices
      With the bloom of Sharon's rose.

  3 Where the wilderness is lying,
      And the trees of ages nod,
    Westward, in the desert crying,
      Make a highway for our God.

      In the forest aisles so dim,
    And the wild-wood's arches pealing

  1 Not with the flashing steel,

    Her emblem is the dove;--
        'Tis thus we come.

  2 The laws of Christian light,--
    These are our weapons bright,

        Our battle-field.

    On which each heart is bent,

    And war's high praise for aye
        No more be sung.

    Let each pure spirit's flame
        Burn bright and clear;

    Cry ye aloud, doubt not,
    Be every fear forgot;
        Christ leads us here!

        One brotherhood,
    Together rise and sing,
    Gifts to one altar bring,
    And heaven's Eternal King
        Pronounce it good.

  1 Lord, once our faith in man no fear could move;
        Now save it from despair!
    The trial comes; strengthen the might of love:
        Father, Thou hearest prayer!

  2 Thou hearest; and we hear, above this din,
        Thy blessed word sound clear:
    "I purge this land from slavery and sin;
        The reign of heaven draws near."

  3 O, never falter, ye who strive to bring
        In men the heavenly birth;
    For still the angel hosts unfaltering sing,
        "Peace to the weary earth!"

  4 O, never falter! peace must come by pain;
        Heaven is not found, but won;
    Hold the dark angel till he moulds again
        The peace he hath undone.

  5 We know not, Lord, what storms and trials strong
        Must work our world's new birth;
    But we will toil, with this for working-song,--
        "Peace to the weary earth!"

  6 Peace to the weary, struggling, sin-sick earth!
        Peace to the heart of man!
    Storm shall bring calm; that high reward is worth
        All we must bear, or can.

    But beautiful as songs of the immortals,
      The holy melodies of love arise.

  1 We love the venerable house
      Our fathers built to God;
    In heaven are kept their grateful vows,
      Their dust endears the sod.

  2 Here holy thoughts a light have shed
      From many a radiant face,
    And prayers of tender hope have spread
      A perfume through the place.

  3 And anxious hearts have pondered here
      The mystery of life,
    And prayed the Eternal Spirit clear
      Their doubts and aid their strife.

  4 From humble tenements around
      Came up the pensive train,
    And in the church a blessing found,
      Which filled their homes again.

  5 For faith, and peace, and mighty love,
      That from the Godhead flow,
    Showed them the life of heaven above
      Springs from the life below.

  6 They live with God, their homes are dust;
      But here their children pray,
    And, in this fleeting lifetime, trust
      To find the narrow way.

  7 On him who by the altar stands,
      On him Thy blessing fall!
    Speak through his lips Thy pure commands,

  1 A wondrous star our pioneer,
      We left the mystic land
    Where heaven-nurtured childhood slept,
      Where yet old visions stand.

  2 O God! the land of dreams we left,
      Repose we left for aye,
    And followed meekly to the place
      Where our Redeemer lay.

  3 That humble manger we have found;
      The world his cradle is;
    His life is hidden far below
      Its sins and miseries.

      To free that world from sin.

      To stand and point above;
    To hurl rebuke at social wrong;
      But all, O God, in love.

  6 The star is resting in the sky;
      To worship Christ we came;
    The moments haste; O, touch our tongues

    We lay our offerings at thy feet,--

    Thine was the strength that nourished ours;
    The children of the cross are Thine.

  3 While watching on our arms, at night,
    We saw Thine angels round us move:
    We heard Thy call, we felt Thy light,
    And followed, trusting to Thy love.

  4 And now, with hymn and prayer we stand,
    To give our strength to Thee, great God!
    We would redeem Thy holy land,
    That land which sin so long has trod.

  5 Send us where'er Thou wilt, O Lord,
    Through rugged toil and wearying fight;
    Thy conquering love shall be our sword,
    And faith in Christ our truest might.

  6 Send down Thy constant aid, we pray;
    Be Thy pure angels with us still;
    Thy truth, be that our firmest stay;
    Our only rest, to do Thy will.

    But show me on thy flowery breast,
    Earth! where thy nameless martyrs rest!

  2 The thousands that, uncheered by praise,
    Have made one offering of their days;
    For truth, for heaven, for freedom's sake,
    Resigned the bitter cup to take;
    And silently, in fearless faith,
    Have bowed their noble souls to death.

  3 O, haply all around lie strewed
    The ashes of that multitude!
    It may be that each day we tread
    Where thus devoted hearts have bled,
    And the sweet flowers the children sow
    Take root in holy dust below.

  4 What though no stone the record bears
    Of their deep thoughts and lonely prayers,
    May not our inmost hearts be stilled,
    With knowledge of their presence filled,
    And by their lives be taught to prize
    The meekness of self-sacrifice?

    When, in the power of cruel men,
      They poured their willing blood.

  3 God, whom we serve, our God, can save;
      Can damp the scorching flame,
    Can build an ark, or smooth the wave,
      For such as love His name.

  4 Yea, should it even to man appear,
      At times, as though the Lord
    Forsook His chosen servants here,
      We yet will trust His word.

  5 Lord! if Thine arm support us still
      With its eternal strength,
    We shall o'ercome the mightiest ill,
      And conquerors prove, at length.

  1   Heave, mighty ocean, heave!
      And blow, thou boisterous wind!
    Onward we swiftly glide, and leave
      Our home and friends behind.

  2   Away, away we steer,
      Upon the ocean's breast;
    And dim the distant heights appear,
      Like clouds along the west.

  3   There is a loneliness
      Upon the mighty deep;
    And hurried thoughts upon us press,
      As onward still we sweep.

  4   But there is hope and joy,
      Wherever we may be;
    Danger nor death can e'er destroy
      Our trust, O God, in Thee!

  5   Then wherefore should we grieve
      Or what have we to fear?
    Though home and friends and life we leave,
      Our God is ever near.

  6   Sweep, mighty ocean, sweep!
      Ye winds, blow foul or fair!
    Our God is with us on the deep,
      Our home is everywhere.

  1 Launch thy bark, mariner!
      Christian, God speed thee!
    Let loose the rudder bands,
      Good angels lead thee!
    Set thy sails warily,
      Tempests will come;
    Steer thy course steadily,
      Christian, steer home!

  2 Look to the weather bow,
      Breakers are round thee;
    Let fall thy plummet now,
      Shallows may ground thee.
    Reef in thy foresail there;
      Hold the helm fast;
    So,--let the vessel wear,--
      By swept the blast.

  3 Slacken no sail yet, at
      Inlet or island;
    Straight for the beacon steer,--
      Straight for the highland;
    Crowd all the canvass on,
      Cut through the foam;--
    Christian! cast anchor now;
      Heaven is thy home!

  1 Many a power within earth's bosom,
      Noiseless, hidden, works beneath;
    Hence are seed and leaf and blossom,
      Golden ear and clustered wreath.

  2 Wind and frost, and hour and season,
      Land and water, sun and shade,--
    Work with these, as bids thy reason,
      For they work thy toil to aid.

  3 Sow thy seed and reap in gladness!
      Man himself is all a seed;
    Hope and hardship, joy and sadness,
      Slow the plant to ripeness lead.

  1 In pleasant lands have fallen the lines
    That bound our goodly heritage,
    And safe beneath our sheltering vines
    Our youth is blest, and soothed our age.

  2 What thanks, O God, to Thee are due,
    That Thou didst plant our fathers here,
    And watch and guard them as they grew,
    A vineyard to the planter dear!

  3 The toils they bore our ease have wrought;
    They sowed in tears,--in joy we reap;
    The birthright they so dearly bought
    We'll guard, till we with them shall sleep.

  4 Thy kindness to our fathers shown,
    In weal and woe, through all the past,
    Their grateful sons, O God, shall own,
    While here their name and race shall last.

  1 From foes that would our land devour;
    From guilty pride and lust of power;
    From wild sedition's lawless hour;
          From yoke of slavery;

  2 From blinded zeal, by faction led;
    From giddy change, by fancy bred;
    From poisoned error's serpent head;
          Good Lord, preserve us free!

  1 O Thou, whose presence went before
    Our fathers in their weary way,
    As with Thy chosen moved of yore
    The fire by night, the cloud by day!

  2 When, from each temple of the free,
    A nation's song ascends to heaven,
    Most holy Father, unto Thee
    Now let our humble prayer be given.

  3 Sweet peace be here; and hope and love
    Be round us as a mantle thrown,
    As unto Thee, supreme above,
    The knee of prayer is bowed alone.

  4 And grant, O Father, that the time
    Of earth's deliverance may be near,
    When every land, and tongue, and clime,
    The message of Thy love shall hear;--

  5 When, smitten as with fire from heaven,
    The captive's chain shall sink in dust,
    And to his fettered soul be given
    The glorious freedom of the just.

  1 The land our fathers left to us
      Is foul with hateful sin;
    When shall, O Lord, this sorrow end,
      And hope and joy begin?

  2 What good, though growing might and wealth
      Shall stretch from shore to shore,
    If thus the fatal poison-taint
      Be only spread the more?

  3 Wipe out, O God, the nation's sin,
      Then swell the nation's power;
    But build not high our yearning hopes,
      To wither in an hour!

  4 No outward show nor fancied strength
      From Thy stern justice saves;
    There is no liberty for them
      Who make their brethren slaves!

  1 Men! whose boast it is that ye
    Come of fathers brave and free,
    If there breathe on earth a slave,
    Are ye truly free and brave?
    If ye do not feel the chain,
    When it works a brother's pain,
    Are ye not base slaves indeed,
    Slaves unworthy to be freed?

  2 Is true freedom but to break
    Fetters for our own dear sake,
    And with leathern hearts forget
    That we owe mankind a debt?
    No! true freedom is to share
    All the chains our brothers wear,
    And with heart and hand to be
    Earnest to make others free.

  3 They are slaves, who fear to speak
    For the fallen and the weak;
    They are slaves, who will not choose
    Hatred, scoffing, and abuse,
    Rather than, in silence, shrink
    From the truth they needs must think;
    They are slaves, who dare not be
    In the right with two or three.

  1 Lord, when Thine ancient people cried,
    Oppressed and bound by Egypt's king,
    Thou didst Arabia's sea divide,
    And forth Thy fainting Israel bring.

  2 Lo, in these latter days, our land
    Groans with the anguish of the slave:
    Lord God of hosts! stretch forth Thy hand,
    Not shortened that it cannot save.

  3 Roll back the swelling tide of sin,
    The lust of gain, the lust of power;
    The day of freedom usher in:
    How long delays the appointed hour?

  4 As Thou of old to Miriam's hand
    The thrilling timbrel didst restore,
    And to the joyful song her land
    Echoed from desert to the shore;

  5 O let Thy smitten ones again
    Take up the chorus of the free,--
    Praise ye the Lord! His power proclaim,
    For He hath conquered gloriously!

  1 Ages, ages have departed,
      Since the first dark vessel bore
    Afric's children, broken-hearted,
      To this far-off western shore;
        She, like Rachel,
      Weeping, for they were no more.

  2 Millions, millions have been slaughtered
      In the fight and on the deep;
    Millions, millions more have watered,
      With such tears as captives weep,
        Fields of labor
      Where their wasted bodies sleep.

  3 Mercy, mercy, vainly pleading,
      Rends her garments, smites her breast,
    Till a voice from heaven proceeding
      Gladden all the waiting west:
        "Come, ye weary!
      Come, and I will give you rest!"

  4 Tidings, tidings of salvation!
      Brothers, rise with one accord,
    Purge the plague-spot from our nation,
      Till, unto their rights restored,
        Slaves no longer,
      All are freemen in the Lord!

    Darkness yet covers the face of the deep;
      Spirit of freedom! go forth in thy might,
    Break the slave's bondage like infancy's sleep,
      The moment when God shall say, Let there be light!

  2       Gaze we meanwhile for the day,
          Praying in thought while we gaze;
          Watch for the morning's first ray;
          Prayer then be turned into praise!
    Shout to the valleys, Behold ye the morn,
      Long, long desired, but denied to our sight;
    Lo, myriads of slaves into men are new-born;
      The word was omnipotent, and there is light!

  1 O Thou, at whose rebuke, the grave
    Back to warm life the sleeper gave,
    Who, waking, saw with joy, above,
    A brother's face of tenderest love;--

  2 Thou, unto whom the blind and lame,
    The sorrowing, and the sin-sick came;
    The burden of thy holy faith
    Was love and life, not hate and death.

  3 O, once again thy healing lay
    On the blind eyes which know thee not,
    And let the light of thy pure day
    Shine in upon the darkened thought!

  4 O, touch the hearts of men, and show
    The power which in forbearance lies;
    And let them feel that Mercy now
    Is better than old Sacrifice!

  1 What precept, Jesus, is like thine,--
    Forgive, as ye would be forgiven!
    In this we see the power divine,
    Which shall transform our earth to heaven.

  2 O, not the harsh and scornful word
    The victory over sin can gain,
    Not the dark prison, or the sword,
    The shackle, or the weary chain.

  3 But from our spirits there must flow
    A love that will the wrong outweigh;
    Our lips must only blessings know,
    And wrath and sin shall die away.

  4 'Twas heaven that formed the holy plan
    To win the wanderer back by love;
    Thus let us save our brother, man,
    And imitate our God above.

                        Teaching Little Children.


  1 O, say not, think not, heavenly notes
      To childish ears are vain,--
    That the young mind at random floats,
      And cannot reach the strain.

  2 Was not our Lord a little child,
      Taught by degrees to pray,
    By father dear and mother mild
      Instructed day by day?

  3 And loved he not of heaven to talk
      With children in his sight,
    To meet them in his daily walk,
      And to his arms invite?

  4 And though some tones be weak and low,
      What are all prayers beneath,
    But cries of babes, that cannot know
      Half the deep thought they breathe?

  5 In his own words we Christ adore;
      But angels, as we speak,
    Higher above our meaning soar
      Than we o'er children weak.

  6 And yet his words mean more than they,
      And yet he owns their praise;
    O, think not that he turns away
      From infants' simple lays!

      We seek Thy grace alone,
    In childhood, manhood, age, and death,
      To keep us still Thine own!

      "Forbid them not to come;
    Of such is heaven; and souls like these
      Shall find in heaven their home."

  3 We bring them, Lord, with thankful hands,
      And yield them up to Thee;
    Joyful that we ourselves are Thine,
      Thine let our offspring be!

  1 Ye joyous ones! upon whose brow
      The light of youth is shed,
    O'er whose glad path life's early flowers
      In glowing beauty spread;
    Forget not Him whose love hath poured
      Around that golden light,
    And tinged those opening buds of hope
      With hues so softly bright.

  2 Thou tempted one! just entering
      Upon enchanted ground,
    Ten thousand snares are spread for thee,
      Ten thousand foes surround:
    A dark and a deceitful band,
      Upon thy path they lower;
    Trust not thine own unaided strength
      To save thee from their power.

  3 Thou whose yet bright and joyous eye
      May soon be dimmed with tears,
    To whom the hours of bitterness
      Must come in coming years;
    Teach early thy confiding eye
      To pierce the cloudy screen,
    To look above the storms of life,
      Eternally serene.

  1 While yet the youthful spirit bears
    The image of its God within,
    And uneffaced that beauty wears,
    Which may too soon be stained by sin;

  2 Then is the time for faith and love
    To take in charge their precious care,--
    Teach the young heart to look above,
    Teach the young lips to speak in prayer.

  3 The world will come with care and crime,
    And tempt too oft that heart astray;
    Still the seed sown in early time
    Shall not be wholly cast away.

  4 The infant prayer, the infant hymn,
    Within the darkened soul will rise,
    When age's weary eye is dim,
    And the grave's shadow round us lies.

    The infant prayer is breathed once more;
    Reclasping thus the broken chain,
    We turn to all we loved before.

  1 Great God! and wilt Thou condescend
    To be my Father and my Friend?
    I but a child,--and Thou so high,
    The Lord of earth and air and sky!

  2 Art Thou my Father?--Let me be
    A meek, obedient child to Thee;
    And try, in word and deed and thought,
    To serve and please Thee as I ought.

  3 Art Thou my Father?--I'll depend
    Upon the care of such a friend;
    And only wish to do and be
    Whatever seemeth good to Thee.

  4 Art Thou my Father?--Then, at last,
    When all my days on earth are past,
    Send down, and take me, in Thy love,
    To be Thy better child above.

  1 Our country is Immanuel's ground;
      We seek that promised soil;
    The songs of Zion cheer our hearts,
      While strangers here we toil.

  2 Oft do our eyes with joy o'erflow,
      And oft are bathed in tears;
    But only heaven our hopes can raise,
      And sin alone, our fears.

  3 We tread the path our Master trod;
      We bear the cross he bore;
    And every thorn that wounds our feet
      His temples pierced before.

  4 The flowers that spring along the road
      We scarcely stoop to pluck;
    We walk o'er beds of shining ore,
      Nor waste one wishful look.

      Refining as we run;
    And while we die to earth and sense,
      Our heaven is here begun.

      Fairer than prophets told;
    And never did an angel guest
      One half its peace unfold.

  1 Now gird your patient loins again,
      Your wasting torches trim!
    The chief of all the sons of men,
      Shall we not welcome him?
    Fill all his courts with sacred songs,
      And from the temple wall
    Wave garlands o'er the joyful throngs
      That crowd his festival!

  2 And still more freshly in the mind
      Store up the hopes sublime
    Which then were born for all mankind,
      So blessed was the time;
    And, underneath these hallowed eaves,
      A Saviour will be born
    In every heart that him receives,
      On his triumphal morn.

                        The Garden of Gethsemane.


  1 Jesus, while he dwelt below,
      As divine historians say,
    To a place would often go,
      Near to Kedron's brook that lay:
    In this place he loved to be,
    And 'twas named Gethsemane.

  2 'Twas a garden, as we read,
      At the foot of Olivet,
    Low and proper to be made
      The Redeemer's lone retreat:
    When from noise he would be free,
    Then he sought Gethsemane.

  3 Thither, by their Master brought,
      His disciples likewise came;
    There the heavenly truths he taught
      Often set their hearts on flame:
    Therefore they, as well as he,
    Visited Gethsemane.

  4 Oft conversing here they sat;
      Or might join with Christ in prayer;
    O, what blest devotion that,
      When the Lord himself is there!
    All things there did so agree
    To endear Gethsemane.

  5 Full of love to man's lost race,
      On the conflict much he thought;
    This he knew the destined place,
      And he loved the sacred spot:
    Therefore Jesus chose to be
    Often in Gethsemane.

                        The Communion of Saints.


  1 The saints on earth and those above
      But one communion make;
    Joined to their Lord in bonds of love,
      All of His grace partake.

  2 One family, we dwell in Him;
      One church above, beneath;
    Though now divided by the stream,
      The narrow stream of death.

  3 One army of the living God,
      To His command we bow;
    Part of the host have crossed the flood
      And part are crossing now.

  4 O God, be Thou our constant guide!
      Then, when the word is given,
    Bid Thou death's flood its waves divide,
      And land us safe in heaven.

  1 Not to the terrors of the Lord,
      The tempest, fire, and smoke;
    Not to the thunder of that word
      Which God on Sinai spoke;--

  2 But we are come to Zion's hill,
      The city of our God,
    Where milder words declare His will,
      And spread His love abroad.

  3 Behold the great, the glorious host
      Of angels, clothed in light!
    Behold the spirits of the just,
      Whose faith is turned to sight!

  4 In such society as this,
      My weary soul would rest;
    For he who dwells where Jesus is
      Must be forever blest.

  1 By earth hemmed in, by earth oppressed,
    'Tis hard to labor,--hard to pray;
    And of the week, for prayer and rest,
      We've but one Sabbath day.

  2 But purer spirits walk above,
    Who worship alway; who are blest
    With an upspringing might of love
      That makes all labor, rest.

  3 Father, while here, we would arise
    In spirit to that realm; and there
    Be every act a sacrifice,
      And every thought a prayer!

  1 Grows dark thy path before thee?
      Press on! still undismayed;
    Heaven shines resplendent o'er thee,
      Though earth be wrapped in shade.

  2 And God, thy trust, hath given,
      With word from swerving free,
    The angels of high heaven
      A charge concerning thee.

  3 Then though thy feet may falter
      Even at early morn,
    And from hope's burning altar
      The light may be withdrawn,--

  4 Yet from thy self-prostration
      Thou shalt awake in power;
    From tears and lamentation,
      To conquest every hour.

  5 Strong in thy perfect weakness,
      Thy strength shall never fail;
    Mighty in holy meekness,
      Thine arm shall still prevail.

      Hath led our souls astray;
    When, blind, by blinder guides we're told,
      "Lo, here thou'lt find the way;"

  2 Look down, O Father, from above;
      Set us from error free;
    Teach us to serve Thee here in love,
      And find our home in Thee.

  3 When faith Thy guidance humbly takes,
      And seeks Thy will to do,
    Clear light upon our pathway breaks,
      The world to guide us through.

  4 Thy spirit send, our souls to keep;
      Thy wisdom make our own;
    And though our way leads through the deep,
      We wander not alone.

  1 The light pours down from heaven,
      And enters where it may;
    The eyes of all earth's children
      Are cheered with one bright day.

  2 So let the mind's true sunshine
      Be spread o'er earth as free,
    And fill men's waiting spirits,
      As the waters fill the sea.

  3 The soul can shed a glory
      On every work well done;
    As even things most lowly
      Are radiant in the sun.

  4 Then let each human spirit
      Enjoy the vision bright;
    The truth which comes from heaven
      Shall spread like heaven's own light;

  5 Till earth becomes God's temple;
      And every human heart
    Shall join in one great service,
      Each happy in his part.

  1 Beneath Thy trees to-day we met,
      Amid Thy summer flowers;
    And every heart is blessing yet
      These happy, fleeting hours.

  2 But creeping shades to vespers call,
      And timely lore impart,
    To make our latest shadows fall
      From sunshine in the heart.

  3 Yes, even so; the summer leaf,
      The summer flowers, declare
    Their childlike, chastening belief,
      That Thou dost make them fair.

  4 O, let us cherish nature's creed,
      And live and bloom to Thee;
    For only childlike hearts, we read,
      Can grace eternity.

        We bless the kind care that doth keep

    O, how in their weakness shall children repay
    Thy fatherly kindness, by night and by day?

  2     Our voices shall utter Thy praise,
        Our hearts shall o'erflow with Thy love;
        O, teach us to walk in Thy ways,
        And lift us earth's trials above!
    The heart's true affection is all we can give;
    In love's pure devotion, O, help us to live!

  3     So long as Thou seest it right
        That here upon earth we should stay,
        We pray Thee to guard us by night,
        And help us to serve Thee by day;
    And when all the days of this life shall be o'er,
    Receive us in heaven, to serve Thee the more.

    Those sacred hours this low earth leave,
    Wafted on wings of praise and prayer.

  2 The time, how lovely and how still!
    Peace shines and smiles on all below;
    The plain, the stream, the wood, the hill,
    All fair with evening's setting glow!

  3 Season of rest! the tranquil soul
    Feels thy sweet calm, and melts in love;
    And while these sacred moments roll,
    Faith sees a smiling heaven above.

    And finding there the house of God,
      With heaven then close the day.

    I sleep, but my heart waketh, Lord,

  2 His bounty is tender, His being is love;
    His smile fills with splendor the blue arch above;
    Confiding, believing, O, enter always
    His courts with thanksgiving, His portals with praise!

  3 Come not to His temple with pride in thy mien
    But lowly and simple, in courage serene;
    Bring meekly before Him the faith of a child,
    Bow down and adore Him with heart undefiled!

  3 Praise Him, all ye hosts above;

    Sun and moon! your voices raise;
    Sing, ye stars! your Maker's praise.

  4 Earth! from all thy depths below,
    Ocean's hallelujahs flow;
    Lightning, vapor, wind, and storm,
    Hail and snow! His will perform.

  5 Birds! on wings of rapture soar,
    Warble at His temple's door;
    Joyful sounds from herds and flocks,
    Echo back, ye caves and rocks!

  6 High above all height His throne;
    Excellent His name alone;
    Him let all His works confess!
    Him let all His children bless!

  3 All that spring with bounteous hand
    Scatters o'er the smiling land,
    All the plenty summer pours,
    Autumn's rich, o'erflowing stores;--

  4 Peace, prosperity, and health,

    'Midst the springing grass prepare

  2 When I faint with summer's heat,
    He shall lead my weary feet
    To the streams that, still and slow,
    Through the verdant meadow flow:
    When through devious paths I stray,
    He shall teach the better way

  3 Though the dreary vale I tread,
    By the shades of death o'erspread,
    I shall walk from terror free,
    While each needed strength I see
    By Thy rod and staff supplied;
    This my guard, and that my guide.

  4 Thou my plenteous board hast spread;
    Thou with oil refreshed my head;
    Filled by Thee, my cup o'erflows;

    Thou my footsteps shalt attend.

    And He as sovereign Lord and King

  2 That stream of Truth--a silver thread,
    Scarce known, save by its fountain-head--
    Now onward pours, a mighty flood,
    And fills the new-formed world with good.

  3 Where'er that living fountain flows,
    New life its healing wave bestows,
    And man, from sin's corruptions free,
    Inspires with its own purity.

  4 A spirit, breathed from Zion's hill,
    In holy hearts is living still,--
    That Comforter from heaven above,

    Our bond of peace and unity!
    Thus shall we teach, as Christ began,
    Through love, the brotherhood of man.

      Looks down on Zion's hill;
    The city sleeps; 'tis night's calm moon,
      And all the streets are still.

  2 How soft, how holy, is the light!
      And hark! a sweet, low song,
    As gently as these dews of night,
      Floats on the air along.

  3 Affection's wish, devotion's prayer,
      Are in that holy strain;
    And hope and love and trust are there,
      And triumph, won through pain.

  4 'Tis Jesus and his faithful few
      That soul-deep hymn who pour;--
    O Christ! may we the song renew,
      And learn to love thee more.

      We could not fly to Thee!

  2 But Thou wilt heal the broken heart,
      Which, like the plants that throw
    Their fragrance from the wounded part,
      Breathes sweetness out of woe.

  3 When joy no longer soothes or cheers,
      And e'en the hope that threw
    A moment's sparkle o'er our tears
      Is dimmed and vanished too;

  4 O, who would bear life's stormy doom,
      Did not Thy wing of love
    Come, brightly wafting through the gloom
      Our peace-branch from above?

  5 Then sorrow, touched by Thee, grows bright,
      With more than rapture's ray;
    The darkness shows us worlds of light
      We never saw by day.

                          The Elder Scripture.


  1 There is a book, who runs may read,
      Which heavenly truth imparts;
    And all the lore its scholars need,
      Pure eyes and loving hearts.

  2 The works of God, above, below,
      Within us, and around,
    Are pages in that book, to show
      How God himself is found.

  3 The glorious sky, embracing all,
      Is like the Father's love;
    Wherewith encompassed, great and small
      In peace and order move.

  4 The dew of heaven is like His grace;
      It steals in silence down;
    But where it lights, the favored place
      By richest fruits is known.

  5 Two worlds are ours; 'tis only sin
      Forbids us to descry
    The mystic heaven and earth within,
      Plain as the earth and sky.

  6 Thou, who hast given me eyes to see
      And love this sight so fair,
    Give me a heart to find out Thee,
      And read Thee everywhere!

                                  Rest.


  1 O Thou, the primal fount of life and peace,
    Who shedd'st Thy breathing quiet all around,
    In me command that pain and conflict cease,
    And tune to music every jarring sound.

  2 Make Thou in me, O God, through shame and pain,
    A heart attuned to Thy celestial calm;
    Let not the spirit's pangs be roused in vain,
    But heal the wounded breast with soothing balm!

  3 So, firm in steadfast hope, in thought secure,
    In full accord with all Thy works of joy,
    May I be nerved to labors high and pure,
    And Thou Thy child to do Thy work employ.

  4 In One who walked on earth, a man of woe,
    Was holier peace than even this hour inspires;
    From him to me let inward quiet flow,
    And give the might my failing will requires.

  5 So this great universe,--so he, and Thou,
    The central source and wondrous bound of things,
    May fill my heart with rest as deep as now
    To land and sea and air Thy presence brings.

  1 The breaking waves dashed high
      On a stern and rock-bound coast,
    And the woods against a stormy sky
      Their giant branches tossed,
    And the heavy night hung dark,
      The hills and waters o'er,
    When a band of exiles moored their bark
      On the wild New England shore.

  2 Not as the conqueror comes,
      They, the true-hearted, came;
    Not with the roll of the stirring drums,
      And the trumpet that sings of fame.
    Not as the flying come,
      In silence and in fear;
    They shook the depths of the desert's gloom
      With their hymns of lofty cheer.

  3 Amidst the storm they sang;
      And the stars heard, and the sea!
    And the sounding aisles of the dim woods rang
      To the anthem of the free.
    The ocean eagle soared
      From his nest by the white wave's foam,
    And the rocking pines of the forest roared,--
      This was their welcome home!

  4 What sought they thus afar?
      Bright jewels of the mine?
    The wealth of seas, the spoils of war?
      They sought a faith's pure shrine!
    Ay, call it holy ground,
      The soil where first they trod!
    They have left unstained, what there they found:
      Freedom to worship God.

  1 Of all the thoughts of God, that are
    Borne in upon our souls afar
      Along the Psalmist's music deep,
    O, tell me if there any is,
    For gift or grace, surpassing this,--
      "He giveth His beloved sleep."

  2 O earth, so full of dreary noises!
    O men, with wailing in your voices!
      O delved gold, the wailers' heap!
    O strife, O curse, that o'er it fall!
    God makes a silence through you all,--
      He giveth His beloved sleep.

  3 His dews drop mutely on the hill,
    His cloud above it saileth still,
      Though on its slope men toil and reap;
    More softly than the dew is shed,
    Or cloud is floated overhead,
      He giveth His beloved sleep.

    A holy calm should welcome in

      And hushed within the breast!
    A holy joy should welcome there
      This happy day of rest.

  3 Each better thought the spirit knows,
      This hour, the spirit fill!
    And Thou, from whom its being flows,
      O, teach it all Thy will!

    But by the fruits of holiness,
      The life of God is shown;

  2 While in Thy house of prayer we meet,
      And call Thee God and Lord,
    Give us a heart to follow Thee,
      Obedient to Thy word!

  3 When we our voices lift in praise,
      Give Thou us grace to bring
    An offering of unfeigned thanks,
      And with the spirit sing.

      Uphold us as we go;
    That with our lips and in our lives
      Thy glory we may show.

      Banish all our fears at length,
    Rest upon this congregation,
      Spirit of unfailing Strength!

  2 Let that love, which knows no measure,
      Now in quickening showers descend,
    Bringing us the richest treasure

      Every struggling heart release,
    Rest upon this congregation,
      Spirit of eternal Peace!

    Which sends the dreams of earth away,
      And yields a glimpse of opening heaven.

  2 Rich day of holy, thoughtful rest,
      We would improve the calm repose;
    And, in God's service truly blest,
      Forget the world, its joys and woes.

  3 Lord! may Thy truth, upon the heart,
      Now fall and dwell as heavenly dew,
    And flowers of grace in freshness start
      Where once the weeds of error grew.

  4 May prayer now lift her sacred wings,
      Contented with that aim alone
    Which bears her to the King of kings,
      And rests her at his sheltering throne.

  2 O leave us not, through long and darkened hours,
      In night of woe and sin,
    But shed Thy Sabbath with its radiant powers
      Upon the world within.

  3 Purge from our hearts the stains so deep and foul,
      Of wrath and pride and care;
    Send Thine own holy calm upon the soul,

  4 Banish this craving self that still has sought
      Lord of the soul to be;
    Teach us to turn to fellow-men our thought;

  5 Teach us to love Thy creatures great and small
      To live as in Thine eye;

    Fall in a good and honest soil;
    And springing up from firmest root,
    Through patience, bear abundant fruit.

    Yet whereso'er our spirits bend
    In rev'rent faith and humble prayer,
    Thy promised blessing will descend,
    And we shall find Thy spirit there.

  2 Lord! be the spot where now we meet
    An open gateway into heaven;
    Here may we sit at Jesus' feet,
    And feel our deepest sins forgiven.
    Here may desponding care look up;
    And sorrow lay its burden down,
    Or learn, of him, to drink the cup,
    To bear the cross, and win the crown.

  3 Here may the sick and wandering soul
    To truth still blind, to sin a slave,
    Find better than Bethesda's pool,
    Or than Siloam's healing wave.
    And may we learn, while here apart
    From the world's passion and its strife;
    That Thy true shrine's a loving heart,
    And Thy best praise a holy life!

    Upsoaring on the wings of awe and meekness;
        Forgive its weakness!

  2 We see Thy hand; it leads us, it supports us:
    We hear Thy voice; it counsels and it courts us:
    And then we turn away; and still Thy kindness
        Forgives our blindness.

  3 O how long-suffering, Lord! but Thou delightest
    To win with love the wandering; Thou invitest,
    By smiles of mercy, not by frowns or terrors,
        Man from his errors.

  4 Father and Saviour! plant within each bosom
    The seeds of holiness; and bid them blossom
    In fragrance and in beauty bright and vernal,
        And spring eternal.

  5 Then place them in Thine everlasting gardens,
    Where angels walk, and seraphs are the wardens;
    Where every flower escaped through death's dark portal,
        Becomes immortal.

    Temple of the Deity;--
    Came to bear our souls on high;
    In the path himself hath trod,
    Leading back his saints to God.

                              Thanksgiving.


  1 Meet and right it is to sing,
      In every time and place,
    Praises to our heavenly King,
      The God of truth and grace.
    Join we then in sweet accord,
    All in one thanksgiving join;
    Holy, holy, holy Lord,
      Eternal praise be Thine!

  2 Thee, the first-born sons of light,
      In choral symphonies,
    Praise alway, day without night,
      In songs that never cease.
    And with them our hearts aspire,
    On the wings of faith and love,
    Vying with the heavenly choir,
      Who chant Thy praise above.

  3 Still they sing, with glory crowned,
      Thanksgiving to Thy name;
    Lower if our voices sound,
      Our hymn is still the same;
    "Glory be to God on high!"
    So the song of angels ran,
    And our voices still reply,
      "Good-will on earth to man!"

  1 Hallelujah! best and sweetest
    Of the hymns of praise above;
    Hallelujah! thou repeatest,
    Angel-host, these notes of love;
        This ye utter,
    While your golden harps ye move.

  2 Hallelujah! strains of gladness
    Comfort not the faint and worn;
    Hallelujah! sounds of sadness
    Best become the heart forlorn:
        Our offences
    We with bitter tears must mourn.

  3 But our earnest supplication,
    Holy God! we raise to Thee;
    Visit us with Thy salvation,
    Make us all Thy peace to see!
        Hallelujah!
    Ours at length this strain shall be.

  2 For His truth and mercy stand,
    Past, and present, and to be,
    Like the years of His right hand,
    Like His own eternity.

  3 Praise Him, ye who know His love;
    Praise Him, from the depths beneath;
    Praise Him in the heights above;
    Praise your Maker, all that breathe!

    O Thou great Spirit! who along
      The waters first did move,
    And straight, from warring chaos sprung

      Bid all their discord cease,
    And breathe upon the troubled soul
      Thy last, best gift of peace!

  1 Lead us with Thy gentle sway,
    As a willing child is led;
    Speed us on our upward way,
    As a pilgrim, Lord, is sped,
    Who with prayers and helps divine
    Seeks a consecrated shrine.

  2 Lead us, Father! Thou dost know
    All the way; but, wanderers, we
    Often miss our way below,
    And stretch out our hands to Thee;
    Guide us, save us, and prepare
    Our appointed mansion there!

  1 Ere to the world again we go,
    Its pleasures, cares, and idle show,
    Thy grace once more, O God, we crave,
    From folly and from sin to save.

  2 May the great truths we here have heard--
    The lessons of Thy holy word--
    Dwell in our inmost bosoms deep,
    And all our souls from error keep.

  3 Oh! may the influence of this day
    Long as our memory with us stay,
    And as an angel guardian prove,
    To guide us to our home above.

    Do Thou from danger and from woe
      This dwelling-place defend.

  2 Here let Thy peace, O Father, rest;
      Here let Thy love abide!
    Our every joy in Thee more blest,
      Each sorrow sanctified.

  3 May our petitions when we meet,
      And every secret prayer,
    Come up before Thy mercy-seat,
      And find acceptance there.

  4 Teach us, with hearts made one in love,
      To do Thy pure commands;
    And give us, in Thy time, above,
      A house not made with hands.

    Gently touch the trembling strings;
    Make the harmony of love,
    Music for the King of kings!

      Draw near and bend the knee,

      O'erwearied with the heat
      And burden of the day,
    Now let us rest our wandering feet,
      And gather here to pray.

  2   The dark and deadly blight
      That walks at noontide hour,
    The midnight arrow's secret flight,
      O'er us have had no power:
      But smiles from loving eyes
      Have been around our way,
    And lips on which a blessing lies
      Have bidden us to pray.

  3   O, blessed is the hour
      That lifts our hearts on high!
    Like sunlight when the tempests lower,
      Prayer to the soul is nigh;
      Though dark may be our lot,
      Our eyes be dim with care,
    These saddening thoughts shall trouble not
      This holy hour of prayer.

    Thy helping arm, Thy guiding word,

    Or walk temptation's slippery way,
    Be still, to lead our steps aright,
    Thy word our guide, Thine arm our stay!

  3 Be ours Thy blessed presence still;
    United hearts, unchanging love;
    No thought that contradicts Thy will,
    No wish that centres not above!

  4 And since we must be parted here,
    Support us when the hour shall come;
    Dry gently Thou the mourner's tear,
    Rejoin us in our heavenly home.

  1 Father, we bless the gentle care
    That watches o'er us day by day,
    That guards us from the tempter's snare,
    And guides us in the heavenward way:--
    We bless Thee for the tender love
    That mingles all our hearts in one,--
    The music of the soul;--above
    'Tis purer spirits' unison.

  2 Father, 'tis evening's solemn hour,
    And cast we now our cares on Thee;
    Darkly the storm may round us lower,
    Peace is within,--Christ makes us free;--
    And when life's toil and joy are o'er,
    And evening gathers on its sky,
    Our circle broke,--we sing no more,--
    O, may we meet and sing on high.

  1 Like morning, when her early breeze

    Her hand may sow the seeds of light;

  2 Thy grace can send its breathings o'er
    The spirit, dark and lost before;
    And freshening all its depths, prepare
    For truth divine to enter there!

  3 Till David touched his sacred lyre,
    In silence lay the unbreathing wire,
    But when he swept its chords along,
    E'en angels stooped to hear the song.

    Shall deign to touch its lifeless chord;
    Till, waked by Thee, its breath shall rise
    In music worthy of the skies.

      Full of strength and peace and love!

      Glad the message will obey.

    Send light into my doubting mind,
      Relieve my fears, assuage my woes;
    O let my soul on Thee be cast,
    Till sin's fierce tyranny be past.

  2 Far, far from Thee, O God, removed,
      Long have I wandered to and fro;
    O'er earth in endless circles roved,
      Nor found whereon to rest below;
    Back unto Thee, at last, I fly:
    Save! for the waters still are high.

  3 Selfish pursuits and pleasure's maze,
      The things of earth, for Thee I leave;
    Pat forth Thy hand, Thy hand of grace,
      Into the ark of love receive;

      In Thee I firmly trust;
    Thy ways, unknown or understood,
      Are merciful and just.

  3 May I remember that to Thee
        Whate'er I have I owe;
    And back in gratitude from me
    May all Thy bounties flow.

  4 Thy gifts are only then enjoyed,
      When used as talents lent;
    Those talents only well employed,
      When in Thy service spent.

  5 And though Thy wisdom takes away,
      Shall I arraign Thy will?
    No, let me bless Thy name, and say
      "The Lord is gracious still."

    Speak to our hearts, and let us feel
      The kindlings of Thy love.

  2 With Thee conversing, we forget
      All toil and time and care;
    Labor is rest, and pain is sweet,
      If Thou art present there.

  3 Here then, our God, be pleased to stay,
      And bid our hearts rejoice;
    Our bounding hearts shall own Thy sway,
      And echo to Thy voice.

  4 Thou callest us to seek Thy face;
      Thy face, O God, we seek,
    Attend the whispers of Thy grace,
      And hear Thee inly speak.

  1 Father divine, our wants relieve
      In this our evil day;
    To all Thy tempted children give
      The power to watch and pray.

  2 Long as our fiery trials last,
      Long as the cross we bear,
    O, let our souls on Thee be cast,
      In never-ceasing prayer!

  3 Thy spirit of untroubled peace
      Give us in faith to claim,
    To wrestle till we see Thy face,
      And know Thy hidden name.

  4 Till Thou Thy perfect love impart,
      Till Thou Thyself bestow,
    Be this the cry of every heart,--
      I will not let Thee go;

  5 I will not let Thee go, unless
      Thou tell Thy name to me;
    With all Thy great salvation bless,
      And make me all like Thee.

  6 Then let us, on the mountain top,
      Behold Thine unveiled face,
    Where faith in sight is swallowed up,
      And prayer in endless praise.

  1 O almighty God of love!
      Thy holy arm display;
    Send us succor from above,
      Against the evil day;
    Arm our weakness with Thy power;
    Put Thy strength our hearts within;
    Be our stronghold and our tower
      Against the assaults of sin.

  2 Could we of Thy strength take hold,
      And always feel Thee near,
    Confident, divinely bold,
      Our souls would know no fear.
    Nothing could their firmness shock;
    Though the gates of hell assail,
    Were we built upon the rock
      They never could prevail.

  3 Thou would'st, in the trying hour,
      A sure protection be,
    Guard us from temptation's power,
      And fix our souls on Thee.
    Lord, on Thee our trust is placed;
    Never thence may we remove;
    In the arms of love embraced,
      Thine everlasting love.

                    Why Art Thou Cast Down, My Soul?


  1   We pray for truth and peace;
      With weary hearts we ask
    Some rest in which our souls may cease
      From life's perplexing task.
      We weep--yet none is found;
      We weep--yet hope grows faint;--
    And deeper in its mournful sound
      Goes up our wild complaint.

  2   Only to living faith
      The promises are shown;
    And by the love that passes death
      The rest is won alone.
      Be ours the earnest heart,
      Be ours the steady will,
    To work in silent trust our part;
      For God is working still.

  3   Then newer lights shall rise
      Above these clouds of sin,
    And heaven's unfolding mysteries
      To glad our souls begin.
      Our hearts from fear and wrong
      Shall win their full release,
    With God's own might forever strong,
      And calm with God's own peace.

      Which doth the mountain move;
    And all my spotless life shall show
      The omnipotence of love.

  3 And, Father, when I doubt that I
      Can live, and sin no more;
    Then if on Thee I dare rely,
      The faith shall bring the power.

    Thy law with all my heart obey,
    And all my soul to Thee submit.

  1 Holy Father, Thou hast taught me
      I should live to Thee alone;
    Year by year, Thy hand hath brought me
      On through dangers oft unknown.
    When I wandered, Thou hast found me;
      When I doubted, sent me light;
    Still Thine arm has been around me,
      All my paths were in Thy sight.

  2 In the world will foes assail me,
      Craftier, stronger far than I;
    And the strife may never fail me,
      Well I know, before I die.
    Therefore, Lord, I come, believing
      Thou canst give the power I need;
    Through the prayer of faith receiving
      Strength,--the spirit's strength indeed.

  3 I would trust in Thy protecting,
      Wholly rest upon Thine arm,
    Follow wholly Thy directing,
      Thou mine only guard from harm!
    Keep me from mine own undoing,
      Help me turn to Thee when tried,
    Still my footsteps, Father, viewing,
      Keep me ever at Thy side!

  1 Wait on the Lord, ye heirs of hope,
    And let His word support your souls;
    Well can He bear your courage up,
    And all your foes and fears control.

  2 He waits His own well-chosen hour
    The intended mercy to display;
    And His paternal pities move,
    While wisdom dictates the delay.

  3 Blest are the humble souls that wait
    With sweet submission to His will;
    Harmonious all their passions move,
    And in the midst of storms are still;--

  4 Still, till their Father's well-known voice
    Wakens their silence into songs;
    Then earth grows vocal with His praise,
    And heaven the grateful shout prolongs.

    But to my loving Father's breast;
    Secure within Thine arms to lie,
    And safe beneath Thy wings to rest!

    I ever into ruin run:

    Lead me a way I have not known;
    Bring me where I my heaven may find,
    The heaven of loving Thee alone.

      Through struggles and through prayer,
    The faith which frees my soul from sin,
      And brings Thy blessing there.

      My fainting brothers raise,
    So Thy triumphant mercy flame
      Around my path of praise.

  6 And earth, with all its pain and toil,
      By love's pure presence blest,
    Shall wear the calm celestial smile
      Of heaven's eternal rest.

  3 O, not in doubt shall be our journey's ending,

      Till thou obtain thy crown.

  4   Fight on, my soul, till death
      Shall bring thee to thy God;
    He'll take thee, at thy parting breath,
      To His divine abode.

                           Bearing the Cross.


  1 Every bird that upward springs
    Bears the Cross upon his wings;
    We without it cannot rise
    Upward to our native skies.

  2 Every ship that meets the waves
    By the Cross their fury braves;
    We, on life's wide ocean tossed,
    If we have it not are lost.

  3 Hope it gives us when distrest,
    When we faint it gives us rest;
    Satan's craft, and Satan's might,
    By the Cross are put to flight.

  4 That from sin earth might be free,
    Jesus bore it; so must we;
    Ne'er through faintness lay it down:
    First the Cross, and then the crown!

  1 Oh God, that mad'st the earth and sky,
      The darkness and the day,
    Oh listen to Thy children's cry,
      And help us when we pray!

  2 For wide the waves of bitterness
      Around our vessel roar,
    And heavy grows the burdened heart,
      To view the rocky shore.

  3 The cross our Master bore for us,
      For him we fain would bear;
    But mortal strength to weakness turns,
      And courage to despair!

  4 Have mercy on our failings, Lord!
      Our sinking faith renew!
    And when his sorrows visit us,
      O send his patience too.

  1 Great ruler of all nature's frame,
      We own Thy power divine;
    We hear Thy breath in every storm,
      For all the winds are Thine.

  2 Wide as they sweep their sounding way,
      They work Thy sovereign will;
    And awed by Thy majestic voice,
      Confusion shall be still.

  3 Thy mercy tempers every blast
      To those who seek Thy face;
    And mingles with the tempest's roar
      The whispers of Thy grace.

  4 Those gentle whispers let me hear,
      Till all the tumult cease;
    And gales of Paradise shall lull
      My weary soul to peace.

  1   Out of the depths of woe,
      To Thee, O Lord, I cry;
    Darkness surrounds Thee, but I know
      That Thou art ever nigh.

  2   Like them whose longing eyes
      Watch till the morning star,
    Though late and seen through tempests, rise,
      Heaven's portals to unbar,--

  3   Like them I watch and pray;
      And though it tarry long,
    Catch the first gleam of welcome day
      Then burst into a song.

  4   Glory to God above!
      The waters soon will cease;
    For lo, the swift returning dove
      Brings home the sign of peace.

  5   Though storms Thy face obscure,
      And dangers threaten loud,
    Thy holy covenant is sure;
      Thy bow is in the cloud!

                         In Time of Tribulation.


  1 In time of tribulation,
      Hear, Lord, our earnest cries;
    With humble supplication
      To Thee the spirit flies.

  2 Remembered songs of gladness,
      Through night's lone silence brought,
    Strike notes of deepest sadness,
      And stir desponding thought.

  3 Hath God cast off forever?
      Can time His truth impair?
    His tender mercy never
      Shall we presume to share?

  4 Hath He His loving-kindness
      Shut up in bitter wrath?
    No! it is human blindness,
      That cannot see His path.

  5 We'll call to recollection
      The years of Thy right hand,
    And, strong in Thy protection,
      Again through Faith we stand.

  6 Thy way is in great waters,
      Thy footsteps are not known;
    But let earth's sons and daughters
      Confide in Thee alone!

  7 Through the wild sea Thou leddest
      Thy chosen flock of yore;
    Still on the wave thou treadest,
      And Thy redeemed pass o'er.

  1 Yea, I will extol Thee,
      Lord of Life and light!
    For Thine arm upheld me,
      Turned my foes to flight.

  2 I implored Thy succor,
      Thou wast swift to save,
    To heal my wounded spirit,
      And bring me from the grave.

  3 Grief may, like the pilgrim,
      Through the night sojourn,
    Yet shall joy, to-morrow,
      With the sun return.

  4 Thou hast turned my mourning
      Into minstrelsy;
    Girded me with gladness,
      Set from thraldom free.

  5 Thee my ransomed powers
      Henceforth shall adore;
    Thee, my great Deliverer,
      Bless forevermore!

      So safety shall be nigh;
    Rend, spirit blest, the heavy chains
      Of death, in victory!

  1 Be Thou, O God, by night, by day,
      My guard, my guide from sin,
    My life, my trust, my light divine,
      To keep me pure within.

  2 Pure as the air, when day's first light
      A cloudless sky illumes,
    And active as the lark that soars
      Till heaven shines round its plumes.

  3 So may my soul, upon the wings
      Of faith, unwearied rise,
    Till at the gate of heaven it sings,
      'Midst light from Paradise.

  1 The daylight is fading o'er earth and o'er ocean,
      The sun has gone down o'er the slumbering sea;
    And now, in the hush of life's fitful commotion,
      We lift our tired spirits, blest Saviour, to thee.

  2 For oft would'st thou wander alone on the mountain,
      As eventide spread her dark wing o'er the wave;
    Now, filling our souls from thy light's ceaseless fountain;
      Be near in the darkness, to bless and to save.

  3 And oft as the tumult of life's heaving billow
      Shall toss our frail bark driving wild o'er night's deep,
    Let thy guarding wing be stretched over our pillow,
      And shield us from evil, though death watch our sleep.

  1 Father supreme! Thou high and holy One,
          To Thee we bow;
    Now, when the labor of the day is done,
          Devoutly, now.

  2 From age to age unchanging, still the same
          All-good Thou art;
    Hallowed forever be Thy reverend name
          In every heart!

  3 When the glad morn upon the hills was spread,
          Thy smile was there;
    Now, as the darkness gathers overhead,
          We feel Thy care.

  4 Night spreads her shade upon another day
          Forever past;
    So o'er our faults, Thy love, we humbly pray
          A veil may cast.

  5 Silence and sleep, o'er hearts by earth distrest,
          Now sweetly steal;
    So every fear that struggles in the breast
          Shall faith conceal.

  6 Thou through the dark will watch above our sleep
          With eye of love;
    And Thou wilt wake us, when the sunbeams leap
          The hills above.

  7 O, may each heart its gratitude express
          As life expands,
    And find the triumph of its happiness
          In Thy commands!

      Nature's evening sacrifice.

  2 With her fragrant offerings blending,
      Let our glad thanksgivings be
    To Thy throne, O Lord, ascending,--
      Incense of our hearts to Thee.

  3 Thou, whose favors without number
      All our days with gladness bless,
    Let Thine eye, that knows no slumber,
      Guard our hours of helplessness.

  4 Then, though conscious we are sleeping
      In the outer courts of death,
    Safe beneath a Father's keeping,
      Calm we rest in perfect faith.

  1 While the stars unnumbered roll
    Round the ever-constant pole,
    Far above these spangled skies
    All my thoughts to God shall rise.

  2 From on high He shall impart
    Secret comfort to my heart;
    He in these serenest hours
    Guide my spiritual powers.

  3 He His spirit doth diffuse,
    Sweeter far than midnight dews;
    Lifting all my thoughts above,
    On the wings of faith and love.

  4 What if death my sleep invade;--
    Should I be of death afraid?
    Whilst encircled by Thine arm,
    Death may strike, but cannot harm.

  5 Visions brighter than the morn
    Greet the deathless spirit born;
    See, the guardian angel nigh
    Waits to waft my soul on high!

  6 With Thy heavenly presence blest,
    Death is life, and labor, rest;
    Welcome sleep or death to me,
    Still secure, for still with Thee!

    Impart to our slumbers Thy calmness divine;
    Drop rest on our lids like the dew on the flower,
    That even our still sleep may have something of Thine.

  2 O watch o'er our couch; drive the tempter away;
    From the sins that corrupt and betray keep us free;
    That nor fancy shall wander, nor passion shall stray,
    And we dream not a thought that's displeasing to Thee.

  3 And grant, when deep sleep o'er our senses shall close,
    That the heart may still watch, all unclouded and clear;
    Guard, guard still Thy children; and bless the repose
    That, stainless of sin, is untouched by a fear.

  4 Then still to Thee, Father, our praises we pay;
    Still to Thee we will offer love's infinite store;
    Send down Thy pure spirit, even now while we pray;
    Be with us, and keep us, and bless, evermore!

    Now guard us in the silent night,
      And in all time, we pray!

      Life's enemy steal in;
    Let not a vision of the night
      Have power to whisper sin.

      When slumber seals our eyes;
    And guiltless as we laid us down,
      So guiltless let us rise.

  1 Creator of all! through whose all-seeing might
    This ponderous globe to its hour is true,
    Thou glad'st us each morn with the vision of light,
    And at eve on our lids pourest slumber like dew.

  2 The toils of the day are now brought to their end,
    And night is preparing her balm for our eyes;
    Our strength, Lord, encourage, our weakness defend;
    Hear our prayers as they spring, and our hymns as they rise!

  3 We beseech of Thee now, when dim night over all
    Is enfolding her shroud and resuming her sway,
    That Thy grace still may shine, 'mid the glooms that appal,
    As a star to our eyes, and a lamp to our way.

  4 Though our bodies may sleep, let our souls be awake,
    Keep them free from the deadness that guilt only knows;
    Be the dream of the night pure as day, for Thy sake,
    And the calm of Thy paradise on our repose!

  5 From all stain of crime let our bosoms be free,
    And still rest on our God, unpolluted and clear;
    So the tempter shall flee; nor our slumbers endure
    One pang of remorse or one shudder of fear.

    Think the Almighty leans to hear;
    Well pleased to list, at such a time,
    The wakeful heart, in praise sublime.

  3 Still watch and pray and raise the hymn,
    Throughout the hours of darkness dim!
    God will not spurn the humblest guest,
    But give us of His holy rest.

  4 Glory to God, who is in heaven!
    Praise to His blessed Son be given!
    Thee, holy spirit, we implore,
    Be with us now and evermore!

    Meek and lowly let us be,
    Full of goodness, full of thee.
    Still, O Lord, our faith increase,
    Give to us the fruits of peace,
    Utterly abolish sin,
    Write thy law of love within.

  3 Hence may all our actions flow,
    Love, the proof that Christ we know;
    Mutual love the token be,

    Love, thine image, love impart,
    Stamp its impress on each heart,
    Only love to us be given,
    Lord, we ask no other heaven.

  1 We follow, Lord, where thou dost lead,

    Redeemed from sin, set free indeed
    Into thy glorious liberty.

  2 We cast behind fear, sin and death;
    With thee we seek the things above;
    Our inmost souls thy spirit breathe,
    Of power, of calmness, and of love.

  3 The power, 'mid worldliness and sin,
    To do, in all, our Father's will;
    Like thee, the victory to win,
    And bid each tempting voice be still.

  4 The calmness perfect faith inspires,
    Which waiteth patiently and long;
    The love which faileth not, nor tires,
    Triumphant over every wrong.

  5 Thus through thy quickening spirit, Lord,
    Thy perfect life in us reveal,
    And help us, as we live to God,
    Still more and more with man to feel.

    Clothe Thy word with power divine,
    Make us willing to be Thine.

  2 Where Thou hast Thy work begun,
    Give new strength the race to run;
    Scatter darkness, doubts, and fears,
    Wipe away the mourner's tears.

  3 Bless us all, both old and young;
    Call forth praise from every tongue:
    Let our whole assembly prove
    All Thy power and all Thy love!

                           Thanksgiving Hymn.


  1 Father of mercies! God of peace!
    Being whose bounties never cease!
    While to the heavens, in grateful tones,
    Ascend our mingled orisons,
    Listen to these, the notes of praise,
    Which we, a happy people, raise!

  2 Our hamlets, sheltered by Thy care,
    Abodes of peace and plenty are;
    Our tillage by Thy blessing yields
    An hundred fold from ripened fields:
    And flowing grain, and burthened vine,
    Are tokens of Thy Love divine.

  3 The cradled head of infancy
    Doth owe its tranquil rest to Thee;
    Youth's doubting step, man's firmer tread,
    In years mature, by Thee are led;
    Secure may trembling age, oh Lord!
    Lean on its staff, Thy holy Word.

  4 Teach us these blessings to improve,
    Teach us to serve Thee, teach to love;
    Exalt our hearts, that we may see
    The Giver of all good in Thee;
    And be Thy word our daily food,
    Thy service, Lord, our greatest good.

                               Christmas.


  1 When in silence, o'er the deep,
    Darkness kept its deathlike sleep,
    Soon as God His mandate spoke,
    Light in wondrous beauty broke.

  2 But a beam of holier light
    Gilded Bethlehem's lonely night,
    When the glory of the Lord,
    Mercy's sunlight, shone abroad.

  3 "Peace on earth, good-will to men."
    Burst the glorious anthem then;
    Angels, bending from above,
    Joined that strain of holy love.

  4 Floating o'er the waves of time,
    Comes to us that song sublime,
    Bearing to the pilgrim's ear
    Words to soothe, sustain, and cheer.

  5 For creation's blessed light,
    Praise to Thee, Thou God of might!
    Seraph-strains Thy name should bless
    For the Sun of Righteousness!

  1 Christ to the young man said: "Yet one thing more,
      If thou wouldst perfect be;
    Sell all thou hast and give it to the poor,
      And come and follow me!"

  2 Within this temple, Christ again, unseen,
      Those sacred words has said;
    And his invisible hands to-day have been
      Laid on a young man's head.

  3 And evermore beside him on his way,
      The unseen Christ shall move,
    That he may lean upon his arm and say,
      "Dost thou, dear Lord, approve?"

  4 Beside him at the marriage feast shall be,
      To make the scene more fair;
    Beside him in the dark Gethsemane
      Of pain and midnight prayer.

  5 O holy trust! O endless sense of rest!
      Like the beloved John,
    To lay his head upon the Saviour's breast,
      And thus to journey on!

  1 Lord! whom winds and seas obey,
    Guide us through the watery way;
    In the hollow of Thy hand,
    Hide and bring us safe to land.

  2 Father, let our faithful mind
    Rest, on Thee alone reclined:
    Every anxious thought repress,
    Keep our souls in perfect peace.

  3 Keep the friends whom now we leave;
    Bid them to each other cleave;
    Bid them walk on life's rough sea,
    Bid them come, by faith, to Thee.

  4 Save, till all these tempests end,
    All who on Thy love depend;
    Waft our happy spirits o'er;
    Land us on the heavenly shore.

                         Prayer for the Sailor.


  1 When the parting bosom bleeds,
    When their native shore recedes,
    When the wild and faithless main
    Takes them to her trust again,
    Father! view the sailor's woe--
    Guide them wheresoe'er they go.

  2 When the lonely watch they keep,
    Silent on the mighty deep,
    While the boisterous surges hoarse
    Bear them daily on their course,
    Eye that never slumbers! shed
    Holy influence on their head.

  3 When the Sabbath's peaceful ray
    O'er the ocean's breast doth play,
    Though no throngs assemble there,
    No sweet church-bell warns to prayer,
    Spirit! let thy presence be
    Sabbath to the unresting sea.

  4 When the raging billows dark
    Thunder round the storm-tossed bark,
    Thou who on the whelming wave
    Didst the loved disciples save,
    Thou canst hear them when they pray,--
    Jesus, Saviour, be their stay!

  1 Lord of the wide-extended main!
    Whose power the winds and seas controls,
    Whose hand doth earth and heaven sustain,
    Whose Spirit leads believing souls;

  2 Throughout the deep Thy footsteps shine;
    We own Thy way is in the sea,
    O'erawed by majesty divine,
    And lost in Thine immensity!

  3 Thy wisdom here we learn to adore,
    Thine everlasting truth we prove,
    The wondrous heights of boundless power,
    The unfathomable depths of love.

  4 Infinite God, Thy greatness spanned
    These heavens, and meted out the skies;
    Lo! in the hollow of Thy hand
    The measured waters sink and rise.

  5 And here Thine unknown paths we trace,
    Which dark to human eyes appear:
    While through the mighty waves we pass
    Faith only sees that God is here.

  1 The Lord our God is full of might,
      The winds obey His will;
    He speaks, and in His heavenly height
      The rolling sun stands still.

  2 Rebel, ye waves! and o'er the land
      With threatening aspect roar;
    The Lord uplifts His awful hand,
      And chains you to the shore.

  3 Howl, winds of night! your force combine;
      Without His high behest,
    Ye shall not in the mountain pine
      Disturb the sparrow's nest.

  4 Ye nations bend, in reverence bend;
      Ye monarchs, wait His nod,
    And bid the choral song ascend
      To celebrate our God!

  1 When long the soul had slept in chains
    And man to man was stern and cold;
    When love and worship were but strains
    That swept the gifted chords of old--
    By shady mount and peaceful lake,
    A meek and lowly stranger came,
    The weary drank the words he spake,
    The poor and suffering blessed his name.

  2 He went where frenzy held its rule,
    Where sickness breathed its spell of pain;
    By famed Bethesda's mystic pool,
    And by the darkened gate of Nain.
    He soothed the mourner's troubled breast,
    He raised the contrite sinner's head,
    And on the loved ones' lowly rest
    The light of better life he shed.

  3 Father, the spirit Jesus knew
    We humbly ask of Thee to-night,
    That we may be disciples too
    Of him whose way was love and light.
    Bright be the places where we tread
    Amid earth's suffering and its poor,
    Until that day when tears are shed,
    And broken sighs are heard, no more.

  1 Lord, lead the way the Saviour went,
      By lane and cell obscure,
    And let our treasures still be spent,
      Like his, upon the poor.

  2 Like him, through scenes of deep distress,
      Who bore the world's sad weight,
    We, in their gloomy loneliness,
      Would seek the desolate.

  3 For Thou hast placed us side by side
      In this wide world of ill;
    And that Thy followers may be tried,
      The poor are with us still.

  1 Now, host with host assembling,
      The victory we win;
    Lo! on his throne sits trembling
      That old and giant Sin;
    Like chaff by strong winds scattered,
      His banded strength has gone,
    His charmed cup lies shattered,
      And still the cry is--"On."

  2 Our fathers' God, our keeper!
      Be Thou our strength divine!
    Thou sendest forth the reaper,
      The harvest all is Thine.
    Roll on, roll on this gladness,
      Till, driven from every shore,
    The drunkard's sin and madness
      Shall smite the earth no more!

  1 Slavery and death the cup contains;
    Dash to the earth the poisoned bowl!
    Softer than silk are iron chains
    Compared with those that chafe the soul.

  2 Hosannas, Lord, to Thee we sing,
    Whose power the giant fiend obeys;
    What countless thousands tribute bring,
    For happier homes and brighter days!

  3 Thou wilt not break the bruised reed,
    Nor leave the broken heart unbound;
    The wife regains a husband freed!
    The orphan clasps a father found!

  4 Spare, Lord, the thoughtless; guide the blind;
    Till man no more shall deem it just
    To live by forging chains to bind
    His weaker brother in the dust.

                       True Worship and Undefiled.


  1 O, he whom Jesus loved has truly spoken!
      The holier worship, which God deigns to bless,
    Restores the lost, and heals the spirit-broken,
      And feeds the widow and the fatherless.

  2 Then, brother man, fold to thy heart thy brother!
      For where love dwells, the peace of God is there;
    To worship rightly is to love each other;
      Each smile a hymn, each kindly deed a prayer.

  3 Follow, with reverent steps, the great example
      Of him whose holy work was doing good:
    So shall the wide earth seem our Father's temple,
      Each loving life a psalm of gratitude.

  4 Thus shall all shackles fall; the stormy clangor
      Of wild war-music o'er the earth shall cease;
    Love shall tread out the baleful fire of anger,
      And in its ashes plant the tree of peace.

  1 God's angels! not only on high do they sing,
    And soar through our skies with invisible wing;
    But here, on the earth, where in wretchedness lie
    Its sin-stricken children to struggle and die.

  2 They come, in their mercy and power, to dispel
    The spectres of gloom from the prisoner's cell;
    In love's name to say to the stricken one there,
    That God still hath ear, and an answer to prayer.

  3 And strong grows the heart of the outcast--and soon
    In that dim prison come the pure light-gleams of noon;
    The resolve and the faith of the sinner forgiven,
    Send him back to the world with a heart seeking heaven.

  4 God's angels! Love speed them o'er earth's wide domain!
    New aids to impart, and new triumphs to gain;
    Till the wrathful and wrong from our world shall retire,
    And humanity's groans in her praises expire.

  5 For the promise of truth--though the doubting deny--
    Is, that love shall prevail in the earth as on high;
    Its life-waters healing, wherever they flow,
    With the angels above, or the angels below.

  2 Thou, who hast stamped on human kind
    The image of a heaven-born mind,
    And in a Father's wide embrace
    Hast cherished all the kindred race;

  3 Great God! whose powerful hand can bind
    The raging waves, the furious wind,
    O bid the human tempest cease,
    And hush the maddening world to peace.

  4 With reverence may each hostile land
    Hear and obey that high command,
    Thy Son's blest errand from above--

    Save from evil, Mighty God!
    Hear--oh! hear the kneeling slave;
    Break--oh! break th' oppressor's rod.

  2 May the captive's pleading fill
    All the earth, and all the sky;
    Every other voice be still,
    While he pleads with God on high.

  3 He, whose ear is everywhere,
    Who doth silent sorrow see,
    Will regard the captive's prayer,
    Will from bondage set him free.

  4 From the tyranny within,
    Save Thy children, Lord! we pray;
    Chains of iron, chains of sin,
    Cast, forever cast away.

  5 Love to man, and love to God,
    Are the weapons of our war;
    These can break th' oppressor's rod--
    Burst the bonds that we abhor.

                                Freedom.


  1 May freedom speed onward, wherever the blood
    Of the wronged and the guiltless is crying to God;
    Wherever from kindred, torn rudely apart,
    Comes the sorrowful wail of the broken of heart.

  2 Wherever the shackles of tyranny bind
    In silence and darkness the God-given mind,
    There, Lord, speed it onward! the truth shall be felt,
    The bonds shall be loosened, the iron will melt.

  3 Help us turn from the cavil of creeds, to unite
    Once again for the poor, in defence of the Right,
    Unappalled by the danger, the shame, or the pain,
    And counting each trial for Truth as our gain.

      Awake! for thy foes shall oppress thee no more;
    Bright o'er thy hills dawns the day-star of gladness,
      Arise! for the night of thy sorrow is o'er.

  2 Strong were thy foes, but the arm that subdued them
      And scattered their legions, was mightier far;
    They fled like the chaff from the scourge that pursued them;
      Vain were their steeds and their chariots of war.

  3 Daughter of Zion, the power that hath saved thee
      Extolled with the harp and the timbrel should be;
    Shout! for the foe is destroyed that enslaved thee;
      Th' oppressor is vanquished, and Zion is free.

    Though earthquake shocks are rocking her,
      And tempests are abroad;
    Unshaken as eternal hills,
      Unmovable she stands,--
    A mountain that shall fill the earth,
      A fane unbuilt by hands.

                      The Day-Spring From on High.


  1 Thy servants in the temple watched
      The dawning of the day,
    Impatient with its earliest beams
      Their holy vows to pay;
    And chosen saints far off beheld
      That great and glorious morn,
    When the glad day-spring from on high
      Auspiciously should dawn.

  2 On us the Sun of Righteousness
      Its brightest beams hath poured;
    With grateful hearts and holy zeal,
      Lord, be Thy love adored;
    And let us look with joyful hope
      To that more glorious day,
    Before whose brightness sin and death,
      And grief, shall flee away.

                           The Pilgrim's Hymn.


  1   Now let our voices join,
      To form one pleasant song:
    Ye pilgrims in God's holy way,
      With music pass along!

  2   How straight the path appears,
      How open and how fair!
    No lurking snares to entrap our feet,
      No fierce destroyer there!

  3   But flowers of paradise
      In rich profusion spring;
    The sun of hope shines on our path,
      And dear companions sing.

  4   All glory to His name,
      Who drew the shining trace;
    To Him who leads the wanderers on,
      And cheers them with His grace.

  5   Subdue the nations, Lord!
      Teach all their kings Thy ways;
    That earth's full choir the notes may swell,
      And heaven resound the praise.

  1 Onward speed thy conquering flight,
      Angel, onward speed!
    Cast abroad thy radiant light,
      Bid the shades recede;
    Tread the idols in the dust,
      Heathen fanes destroy,
    Spread the gospel's love and trust,
      Spread the gospel's joy.

  2 Onward speed thy conquering flight,
      Angel, onward fly!
    Long has been the reign of night,
      Bring the morning nigh.
    Unto thee earth's sufferers lift
      Their imploring wail;
    Bear them heaven's holy gift
      Ere their courage fail.

  3 Onward speed thy conquering flight,
      Angel, onward speed!
    Morning bursts upon our sight,
      Lo, the time decreed!
    Now the Lord His kingdom takes,
      Thrones and empires fall,
    And the joyous song awakes,
      God is all in all.

  1   God of the earnest heart,
      The trust assured and still,
    Thou who our strength forever art,--
      We come to do Thy will!

  2   Upon that painful road
      By saints serenely trod,
    Whereon their hallowing influence flowed,
      Would we go forth, O God!

  3   'Gainst doubt and shame and fear
      In human hearts to strive,
    That all may learn to love and bear,
      To conquer self, and live;

  4   To draw Thy blessing down,
      And bring the wronged redress,
    And give this glorious world its crown,
      The spirit's Godlikeness.

  5   No dreams from toil to charm,
      No trembling on the tongue;--
    Lord, in Thy rest may we be calm,
      Through Thy completeness, strong!

  6   Thou hearest while we pray;
      O deep within us write,
    With kindling power, our God, to-day,
      Thy word,--"On earth be light!"

  1 Prisoners of hope! be strong, be bold;
    Cast off your doubts, disdain to fear!
    The day which prophets have foretold,
    And saints have longed for, draweth near:
    Our God shall in His kingdom come;
    Prepare your hearts to make Him room!

  2 O ye of fearful hearts, be strong!
    Your downcast eyes and hands lift up;
    Doubt not, nor cry "O God, how long?"
    Hope to the end, in patience hope!
    O never from your faith remove;
    Ye cannot fail, for God is love!

  3 Lord, we have faith; we wait the hour
    Which to the earth Thy kingdom brings;
    When Thou, in love, and joy, and power,
    Shalt come and make us priests and kings:
    When man shall be indeed Thy son,
    And Thy pure will on earth be done.

  1 Almighty Spirit, now behold
      A world by sin destroyed!
    Creative spirit, as of old
      Move on the formless void!

  2 Give Thou the word--the healing sound
      Shall quell the deadly strife,
    And earth again, like Eden crowned,
      Bring forth the tree of life.

  3 If sang the morning stars for joy
      When nature rose to view,
    What strains shall angel harps employ,
      When Thou shalt all renew!

  1 We wait in faith, in prayer we wait,
      Until the happy hour
    When God shall ope the morning gate,
      By His almighty power.

  2 We wait in faith, and turn our face
      To where the day-light springs;
    Till He shall come earth's gloom to chase,
      With healing on His wings.

  3 And even now, amid the gray,
      The East is brightening fast,
    And kindling to that perfect day
      Which never shall be past.

  4 We wait in faith, we wait in prayer,
      Till that blest day shall shine,
    When earth shall fruits of Eden bear,
      And all, O God, be Thine!

  5 O, guide us till our night is done!
      Until, from shore to shore,
    Thou, Lord, our everlasting sun,
      Art shining evermore!

                             Lo! He Cometh.


  1 God comes, with succor speedy,
      To those who suffer wrong;
    To help the poor and needy,
      And bid the weak be strong;
    He comes to break oppression,
      And set the captive free,
    To take away transgression,
      And rule in equity.

  2 He shall come down, as showers
      Upon the thirsty earth;
    And joy and hope, like flowers,
      Spring in His path to birth.
    Before Him, on the mountains,
      Shall Peace, the herald, go,
    And Righteousness, in fountains,
      From hill to valley flow.

  3 To Him shall prayer unceasing,
      And daily vows, ascend;
    His kingdom still increasing,
      A kingdom without end.
    The tide of time shall never
      His covenant remove;
    His name shall stand forever;
      His great, best name of Love.

    Pilgrims, for Zion's city bound,
      Be joyful in your King.

  2 See the fair way His hand hath raised,
      How holy and how plain!
    Nor shall the simplest travellers err,
      Nor ask the trace in vain.

  3 No ravening lion shall destroy,
      Nor lurking serpent wound;
    Pleasure and safety, peace and praise,
      Through all the path are found.

  4 A hand divine shall lead you on
      Through all the blissful road,
    Till to the sacred mount you rise,
      And see your smiling God.

  5 There, garlands of immortal joy
      Shall bloom on every head;
    While sorrow, sighing, and distress,
      Like shadows all are fled.

  1 Faint the earth, and parched with drought,
    Make the waters, Lord, gush out!
    Streams of love our thirst to bless,
    Starting in the wilderness.
    Long we wait Thy peace to know:
    Father, bid the waters flow,
    Make the thirsty land a pool,
    Make man's suffering spirit whole.

  2 Hark! the wastes have found a voice;
    Loneliest deserts now rejoice,
    When the Lord His presence shows,
    Lo, they blossom like the rose;
    See! this barren earth of ours
    Buds and puts forth fruits and flowers,
    Flowers of Eden, fruits of peace,
    Love and Joy and Righteousness!

  1 Spirit of peace and love and power,
    Fountain of life and light below,
    Abroad Thy healing influence shower,
    O'er all the nations let it flow.
    Inspire our hearts with perfect love;
    In all the work of faith fulfil;
    So not heaven's host shall swifter move,
    Than we on earth, to do Thy will.

  2 Father, 'tis Thine each day to yield
    Thy children's wants a fresh supply;
    Thou clothest the lilies of the field,
    And hearest the young ravens cry.
    To Thee we pray; for all must live
    By Thee, who knowest their every need--
    Pray for the world, that Thou wilt give
    All human hearts Thy living bread.

  3 In faith we wait and long and pray,
    To see that time, by prophets told,
    When nations, new-born into day,
    Shall be ingathered to Thy fold.
    We cannot doubt Thy gracious will,
    Thou mighty, merciful and just!
    And Thou wilt speedily fulfil
    The word in which Thy servants trust.

  1 Gone is the hollow, murky night,
      With all its shadows dun;
    O shine upon us, heavenly light,
      As on the earth the sun!

  2 Pour on our hearts Thy heavenly beam,
      In radiance sublime!
    Retire before that ray supreme,
      Ye sins of elder time!

  3 Lo, on the morn that now is here
      No night shall ever fall;
    But faith shall burn, undimmed and clear,
      Till God be all in all.

  4 This is the dawn of infant faith;
      The day will follow soon,
    When hope shall breathe with freer breath,
      And morn be lost in noon;

  5 For to the seed that's sown to-day
      A harvest time is given,
    When charity with faith to stay,
      Shall make on earth a heaven.


              GLORY BE TO GOD ON HIGH: AND ON EARTH PEACE:
                            GOOD WILL TO MEN.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
