NETHERLANDS INDIES.

The Netherlands Indies are by far the most important colonial possessions
of the Netherlands. They cover all the Dutch possessions in the East
Indies, and include Java, Madura, Banca, Sumatra, Bingtang, Billiton,
Celebes, the Moluccas, Lombok Bali, and many smaller islands and parts of
New Guinea, Borneo and Timor. Area of the colonies estimated at 636,329
square miles; population, 27,784,959. The superior administration is in the
hands of a Governor General, assisted by a Council of 5 members.

The most important colony is Java, which politically includes the
neighboring island of Madura. Total area, 50,848 square miles; population,
20,259,450. Java is governed under what is termed the culture system, which
was established in 1832.

The strength of the total army in 1883 was 30,421 men, of whom 15,032 were
Europeans, and 15,389 natives. There is a military academy near Batavia,
and attached to every battalion is a school for soldiers. The navy, royal
and colonial, consisted of 79 vessels and 5,029 men.

By far the larger part of the commerce of Dutch India is with the
Netherlands. The average value of the total imports for three years was
$62,500,000: exports, $75,000,000. About two-thirds of the imports were
from the Netherlands, and three-fourths of the exports were sent to that
country. The principal exports are sugar, coffee, rice, indigo and tobacco.
Latest reports give value of coffee exported, $13,086,790; sugar,
$19,625,470; indigo, $1,245,170; spices, $1,021,720; tobacco, $6,457,680.

offices. Number of postoffices, 221. Java has now about 750 miles of
railway.

HAWAII (SANDWICH ISLANDS). Ha-wi'ee.

A kingdom of Oceania, consisting of a group of 15 islands, of which 8 are
inhabited. The government is a limited monarchy. Hawaii is the largest

Island of Hawaii, is one of the highest active volcanoes in the world. The
soil is exceedingly fertile and productive. Chief products, sugar and rice;
but coffee, hides, bone, whale oil and wool are exported in considerable
quantities. Value of exports, 1883, $8,121,200; imports, $5,624,240.

provided with telegraphs, and have about 32 miles of railway. Almost every
house in Honolulu has its telephone.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
