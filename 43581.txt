PREFACE


My original intention with regard to this work, was to publish it in a
series of three volumes; and to that end, the first volume was presented
to the public in 1906.

Since that time, however, I have deemed it advisable, for various
reasons, to incorporate all my data in one volume.

I desire to acknowledge my indebtedness for help in my researches, to
various works on Horticulture, and to many of my personal friends who
have given me valuable assistance.

I trust that this work will prove of some interest, as I believe that it
contains a fairly comprehensive list of both the indigenous and
naturalized Fruits of the Hawaiian Islands.

  AVOCADO.


This spreading evergreen tree is a native of Tropical America. In the
Hawaiian Islands, the first trees of its kind were said to have been
planted in Pauoa Valley, Oahu, by Don Marin. It attains a height of from
10 to 40 feet, and is adverse to drought. Its leaves are
elliptico-oblong, from 4 to 7 inches in length. The flowers are
greenish-yellow and downy. The fruit, which ripens from June until
November, is a round or pear-shaped drupe, covered with a thin, rather
tough skin, which is either green or purple in color. The flesh is
yellow, firm and marrow-like, and has a delicious nutty flavor. The
seed-cavity is generally large, containing one round or oblong seed,
covered by a thin, brown, parchment-like skin. The quality of the pear
is judged, not only by its flavor, but by the presence or absence of
strings or fibre in the meat, and also by the quantity of flesh as
compared to the size of the seed. Innumerable variations as to size,
shape, and quality have been produced from seedlings--some of which may
be seen in the accompanying illustration. The Avocado is easily
reproduced by budding and grafting, and the best varieties may be
obtained in this manner.

  GUATAMALA AVOCADO.


This variety is a native of Mexico, and although known as the Guatamala
Avocado, it is more commonly to be found in the markets of the City of
Mexico. Its leaves are purplish-green. The flowers, which appear in May
and June, are like those of the preceding variety; and the drupe, which
matures in the early part of the year, has a long stem. This fruit is
round, from 3 to 5 inches in diameter, has a thick, tough, rough rind,
which when ripe is a deep claret color, and the meat, which is a
golden-yellow, is tinged with purple next to the rind, and is free from
strings or fibres. There are but two trees of this variety bearing fruit
in Honolulu. They were propagated from seeds brought here in 1890 by
Admiral Beardsley. These two trees are growing in private gardens.

  _Punica Granatum._

  POMEGRANATE.


The name was derived from the word punicus, of Carthage, near which city
it is said to have been discovered; hence malumpunicum, Apple of
Carthage, which was the early name of the Pomegranate. It is a native of
Northern Africa, and of Southwestern Asia, and is grown in the Himalayas
up to an elevation of 6000 feet. It is a deciduous shrub, which by
careful training can be made to grow into a tree from 10 to 15 feet
high. Many shoots spring from the base of the tree, and should be cut
away, as they draw the sap which should go to the fruit-bearing stems.
The branches are slender, twiggy, nearly cylindrical, and somewhat
thorny. The bark contains about 32 per cent. tannin, and is used for
dying the yellow Morocco leather. The peel of the fruit serves also as a
dye. There are several varieties of Pomegranate growing in Hawaii: the
double-flowering variety is popular as an ornamental plant. All of the
varieties are of easy culture, and are readily propagated by means of
cuttings of the ripe wood. The leaves are lanceolate, glabrous, and a
glossy-green with red veins. The flowers are axillary, solitary or in
small clusters, and in color are a very showy rich orange-red. The fruit
is about the size of an ordinary orange, has a persistent calyx, and is
made up of many small compartments arranged in two series, one above the
other. The crisp, sweet, watery pink pulp enveloping each seed is the
edible portion of the Pomegranate.

  FIG.


The Fig is the most ancient, as well as one of the most valuable of all
fruit trees. Its name is nearly the same in all European languages. The
tree is supposed to be a native of Caria in Asia Minor. The intelligent
cultivators of Anatolia, by whom the Smyrna Figs are produced, adhere to
the caprification process, used from time immemorial. In California,
efforts have been made to test this process. In the Hawaiian Islands,
the Portuguese seem to be the most successful cultivators of the Fig,
and several varieties are to be found throughout the group. This common
variety grows to a height of from 10 to 20 feet, is hardy, and can
easily be propagated from cuttings. Its leaves are alternate, 3 to 5
deeply lobed, and are shed during the fall months, at which season
careful pruning will increase the following year's yield. The fruit is
single, appearing from the axils of the leaves, on the new wood. It is a
hollow, pear-shaped receptacle, containing many minute seeds, scattered
throughout a soft, pinkish-white pulp.

  _Ficus Carica._

  FIG.


Some years ago, this variety of Fig was to be found growing in large
numbers at Makawao, and in the Kula district of Maui. Now, however,
there are few, if any, trees remaining, as a destructive blight,
together with the lack of proper attention, has caused their
extermination. This variety is very prolific. The fruit is small,
pear-shaped, and has a particularly sweet and delicious flavor.

  _Ficus Carica_ (white or lemon variety).

  FIG.


This is a low-growing tree with compact foliage. The leaves are small,
and the fruit is round-turbinate, about 1 to 11/2 inches in diameter. The
skin is very thin, is light-green in color, turning to a greenish-yellow
when thoroughly ripe. The pulp is pink, very sweet, and when quite ripe
is free from milky juice. This variety is also prolific, is easily
dried, and on this account would find a ready sale in our markets.

  MOUNTAIN APPLE, "OHIA AI."


This tree is found on all the large islands of the Polynesian groups,
and in the Malaysian Archipelago. In the Hawaiian Islands it confines
itself almost entirely to the moist, shady valleys, and thrives well, up
to an elevation of 1800 feet. It is generally gregarious, and on the
north side of East Maui it forms a forest belt. It attains a height of
from 25 to 50 feet. Its dark, shiny, glabrous leaves are opposite,
elliptico-oblong, and from 6 to 7 inches long, and from 21/2 to 3 inches
broad. The flowers are crimson, fluffy balls, appearing in March and
April, on the naked branches and upper trunk of the tree. The fruit,
which ripens from July until December, generally contains one seed, is
obovate, about 3 inches in diameter. The skin is so thin as to be barely
perceptible, and the fruit is very easily bruised. In color, it is a
deep, rich crimson, shading into pink and white; the pulp is firm,
white, and juicy, with a very agreeable flavor.

  WATER APPLE.


This low-growing tree is very rare in the Hawaiian Islands. It was
introduced here, from the Solomon Islands, by Mr. A. Jaeger. The foliage
and crimson flowers resemble those of the _Jambosa malaccensis_, but the
drupe is not so highly colored, and is, in shape, much more elongated.
Specimens of this sweet, edible fruit have measured 5 inches in length.

  WATER APPLE.


This tree is a native of the Malay Islands. The foliage is symmetrical,
and its opposite, shiny leaves are broad, lanceolate, and
obtusely-acuminate. The pure white flowers, which bloom from March until
June, are about 1/2-inch in diameter, and are produced in bunches on the
naked branches. The fruit, which is also produced in bunches, ripens in
October. It is transversely oval in shape, about 1 to 11/2 inches in
diameter at its largest end. It contains from 1 to 3 seeds. Even when
quite ripe, the fruit remains pure white in color, and has a tart,
insipid flavor.

  WATER APPLE.


This low-growing tree with its bright evergreen foliage, is not common
in Hawaii. The flowers are small, deep crimson, and appear on the
branches either singly or in bunches. The contrast between these
brilliant flowers and the fresh green leaves makes a very beautiful
sight when the tree is in full bloom. The fruit, which ripens in July,
appears in clusters; it is the same shape as that of the preceding
variety, but in color it is a bright scarlet. It contains from 1 to 3
seeds, which are somewhat difficult to germinate. The fruit is crisp,
watery, and has a sub-acid flavor.

  ROSE APPLE.


This evergreen tree, which is a native of the West Indies, is of medium
size, reaching a height of from 20 to 30 feet. It grows well in Hawaii,
and is found at an elevation of 2000 feet. It is propagated from seed,
as well as from cuttings of the ripe wood. The leaves are lanceolate,
acuminate, thick and shiny. The large, fluffy flowers which appear from
January until April, are produced freely, and are a beautiful
creamy-white. The fruit is a somewhat compressed, globular shell,
varying in size from 1 to 2 inches in diameter, and with a large cavity,
containing generally one seed. This shell, which is the edible portion
of the fruit, is a light creamy-yellow, with a tinge of pale-pink on one
side; it requires from 2 to 21/2 months to mature. It is firm, crisp, and
has a delicious flavor, somewhat resembling an apricot, and with a rose
odor. The season for the fruit varies according to the elevation, but
generally ends about August or September.

  BRAZILIAN PLUM, OR SPANISH CHERRY.


This evergreen shrub, or low-growing tree, which in many countries is
said to reach a height of but 6 feet, in Hawaii attains a height of 20
feet; and although it thrives in comparatively high altitudes, it bears
best below the 200-foot elevation, and requires considerable moisture.
The bluntish, dark, shiny leaves, which are scale-like along the
branches, are obovate, oblong, and about 3 inches in length. The
blossoming season varies according to the location; however, the tree
generally has flowers and fruit from July until December. The fruit is
the size of a cherry, is deep purple in color, and the persistent calyx
is very prominent. The sweet pulp has a very agreeable flavor.

Probably the first plants of this variety were brought here by Don
Marin, about a century ago. Some fine trees may be found in Pauoa and
Makiki valleys, and also in Nuuanu, in the garden which formerly
belonged to Dr. Hillebrand.

This shrub is said to be a native of Brazil. In Hawaii, it is a common
garden plant, sometimes reaching a height of 10 feet. Its glossy leaves
are ovate-lanceolate, and its peduncles short. It has small, single,
white fragrant flowers. The mature fruit, which resembles a cherry, is
about 1 inch in diameter, and is ribbed longitudinally. It has a
delicious, spicy, acid flavor. There is generally one large, round,
smooth seed.

This is a small Malayan tree which is rare in Hawaii. It has regular,
opposite, large, broad leaves; with the stems and branches four-sided.
The purplish-white flowers are produced in clusters. The waxy
light-green fruits, with a persistent calyx, resemble a small guava.
These fruits have a very tough, pithy skin and pulp combined, which is
edible, but too dry to be agreeable. The seed is large in proportion to
the size of the fruit.

This tall, hardy tree is a native of Southern Asia. In Polynesia it
grows well, up to an elevation of 5000 feet. It is a very common tree in
the Hawaiian Islands. Its leaves, which are from 4 to 6 inches long, and
from 2 to 3 inches broad, are opposite, obtuse or shortly-acuminate. The
flowers, which bloom in June, July and August, are white and quite
fragrant, and are especially attractive to the honey-bee. The oblong
fruit grows in large clusters, ripens from September until November, and
varies in size from a cherry to a pigeon's egg. It is purplish-black in
color, and is edible only when thoroughly ripe. It contains one large,
oblong seed.

This tree, which is also very common in the Hawaiian Islands, is said to
have been introduced by Dr. Hillebrand. It bears but one crop a year,
will grow in any soil, and withstands dry weather. The foliage is
smaller than that of the preceding variety; its leaves are narrower, and
a lighter green in color. It blooms at about the same time of year, but
its flowers are not as large, and appear in thick bunches. The purplish
fruit ripens from September until December.

  _Averrhoa Carambola._


This tree, which is said to have been named after Averrhoes, an Arabian
physician, is a native of Insular India, and is much cultivated in India
and China. It is evergreen, with dense foliage, and grows to a height of
from 15 to 20 feet. It is easily propagated from seeds, and fruits in
about three years. In Hawaii it bears one crop annually, the flowers
appearing in July and the fruit in November and December. The leaves are
alternate, odd-pinnate. The flowers, which are borne in clusters on the
naked stems and branches, are minute, fragrant, and in color shading
from a pale pink to a deep purplish-red. The fruit, varying in size from
a hen's egg to an orange, is ovate, and has five acutely-angled
longitudinal ribs. The fragrant, light-yellow skin is very thin, and the
pulp is watery; it contains a number of flat, brown seeds. This fruit is
of two varieties: the sweet, which may be eaten raw, and the acid which
is delicious when preserved. A very appetizing pickle may be made from
the half-ripe fruit of the acid variety.

  SAPODILLA, OR NASEBERRY.


This tree, which grows on almost all of the Islands of the Hawaiian
group, is a fine evergreen, growing to a height of from 10 to 20 feet,
and producing a fruit which is much prized in warm countries. The bark
possesses tonic properties, and from the juice chewing-gum is made. Its
foliage is dense, and the shiny leaves are thick, lance-oblong, entire,
and clustered at the ends of the branches. The flowers, which are small,
whitish, and perfect, are borne on the rusty pubescent growths of the
season. The fruit, of which there are two varieties, the round and the
oblong, is about the size of a hen's egg. It has a rough skin, the color
of a russet apple, beneath which is a firm, somewhat stringy, sweet
pulp, having the flavor of an apricot. This pulp is divided into 10 to
12 compartments, and contains from 4 to 6 large, flat, smooth, black
seeds.

This tree, which is a native of Mexico, is said to have been named after
Cardinal Casimiro Gomez. The first tree of its kind in Hawaii was
planted in 1884, at the Government Nursery, Honolulu. The seed came from
Santa Barbara, California, where there grows today, a tree more than
eighty years old, and which still bears its fruit. It is a tall
evergreen with irregular branches; its digitate leaves are dark and
glossy. The trunk is ashen-grey, with warty excrescences. The fruit,
which matures in April and May, is large, 1 to 4 inches in diameter; it
is depressed-globular and somewhat ribbed, like a tomato; in color it is
a light-green, turning to a dull yellow when ripe, and it has a very
thin skin. The pulp is yellow, resembling that of an over-ripe, and has
a melting, peach-like flavor. It contains from 1 to 3 large, oblong
seeds, which are said to be deleterious.

  PEACH.


The Peach-tree is said by some authorities to be indigenous to Persia,
while by others it is claimed to be a native of China. It is a hardy
tree, and has been known to bear fruit precociously even in the second
year after planting. If allowed to do so, the Peach will grow to a
height of about 15 feet; but it should be pruned annually, in order to
secure a good crop. Its leaves are lanceolate and coarsely serrate. The
flowers are solitary, pink in color, and appear before the leaves. The
fruit is soft and pubescent at maturity. The stone is deeply pitted and
very hard. There are two well-marked varieties, the cling-stone and the
free-stone.

Ulupalakua and Makawao, Maui, once had the reputation of growing
finely-flavored seedling peaches; however, many of these trees have been
injured by cattle, and others have been destroyed by root-fungus and
insect pests. In several localities in Hawaii good peaches have been
grown from imported varieties.

  STAR APPLE.


This tree is a native of the West Indies, and although not common in
Hawaii, there are good specimens to be found in many gardens. It has
large irregular spreading branches, grows to a height of from 10 to 25
feet, and has rather thick foliage. Propagation is ordinarily effected
by seeds, which germinate readily, when fresh. It can also be grown from
cuttings of the ripe wood. The tree derives its name from the words
"chrysos," gold, and "phyllon," a leaf; referring to the golden-russet
color of the underside of the beautiful, glossy green leaves. The small
flowers, which appear from June until October, are solitary at the nodes
or in fascicles. The fruit, which ripens in April, is round, about 3
inches in diameter, has a smooth, tough rind, about 1-16th inch thick,
which is a deep purple in color. A cross-section of the fruit shows the
edible pulp with its numerous black seeds, and the star-shaped core,
from which the fruit derives its common name of Star Apple. Unless the
fruit is thoroughly ripe, its milky juice is remarkably astringent.

many localities of tropical America. In Jamaica it is called the "Damson
Plum." Its small, single, white flowers are highly perfumed. The fruit,
which matures from August until December, is small, ovoid-oblong, and
when ripe is purplish-black; when bruised it emits a white, sticky
juice. It contains one large seed. Specimens of this tree are to be
found growing in the grounds of the Queen's Hospital and at the
Government Nursery, Honolulu.

leaves 3 to 31/2 inches long. The small, solitary flowers, have many
creamy-white petals, and are very fragrant; from them perfume is
obtained by distillation. The yellow fruit is about the shape and size
of a small olive, and contains a dry, mealy pulp which is edible, and
the large, flat, brown seed yield an oil.

This deciduous tree is said to be a native of the Society Islands, and
is common to the tropics of both hemispheres. It is a large, spreading
and graceful tree, reaching a height of from 30 to 50 feet. Its pinnate
leaves are green and glossy; the leaflets are oval-oblong and opposite.
The foliage is shed from December until April. The flowers are
paniculate, small, and greenish-white. The fruit, which ripens from
November until April, is a fleshy drupe, oval in shape, from 1 to 3
inches in diameter; it has a thin, smooth, golden-yellow skin, which has
a rather sour disagreeable odor. The fleshy pulp is light yellow, is
mellow when quite ripe, and has a sub-acid delicious flavor, compared by
some to the pineapple. Within this pulp is embedded a 1 to 5 loculed,
bony endocarp, which contains generally one seed. This endocarp is
covered with fibres which penetrate the pulp. The first Wi tree in
Hawaii was planted at the residence of Mr. John S. Walker, Nuuanu
Valley.

  HOG PLUM.


This tree is distributed over Tropical America, West Africa and Java,
where it is commonly called the Hog Plum, and is used for fattening
swine. In Jamaica it grows well, up to an elevation of 4000 feet. It is
a large, graceful tree, about 50 feet high, with spreading branches, and
it is particularly beautiful when in fruit. The pinnate leaves are a
clear green, the leaflets are ovate-lanceolate, and the golden-yellow
fruit hangs in clusters. It ripens in September and October. The fruit
is ovoid, about 1 inch long; it has a smooth skin, having a disagreeable
odor. There is one large seed, which resembles the husk of a ground-nut.
This fruit is cooling and aromatic. To my knowledge there are but two
trees of this kind in bearing in the Hawaiian Islands, and these are
growing in private grounds in Honolulu.

The Mammee Apple, which grows well in Hawaii, is a native of the West
Indies, and is a fruit much esteemed in tropical countries. In Jamaica
it thrives well, up to an elevation of 3000 feet. The tree attains a
height of from 30 to 40 feet, and the wood, which is beautifully
grained, is durable and well adapted to building purposes. Its leaves
are rigid and leathery. The round seeds, varying in number from 1 to 4,
germinate freely, and the young plants are easily raised. The fruit is
from 3 to 6 inches in diameter, is brown or russet color, and has a
yellow pulp, which is sweet and aromatic. The outer rind, as well as the
pulp immediately surrounding the seeds, is very bitter. The fruit may be
eaten raw, and is very delicious when preserved.

  _Tamarindus indica._

  TAMARIND.


The name is derived from Tamar, Arabic for Date, and Indus, Indian; thus
literally meaning Indian Date. It is a native of the Indies, Egypt and
Arabia. The tree is never leafless, and the foliage is graceful,
pinnated and acacia like. It bears one crop a year, the season varying
somewhat according to the location and elevation. It yields a handsome,
hard and close-grained furniture wood, which is yellowish-white, with
occasional red streaks in it; the heart-wood is dark brownish-purple.
The pods are thick, linear, dark brown in color, and from 3 to 6 inches
long. The seeds vary in number. The pulp surrounding the seeds has a
pleasant acid flavor, and when made into syrup, forms the basis of a
delicious, cooling beverage. This pulp is called the fruit, while the
pod is spoken of as the shell. The Tamarind is propagated from both
seeds and cuttings, and is undoubtedly one of the noblest of our
tropical trees.

  DURION.


This fine tree attains a height of from 60 to 80 feet; it derives its
name from the Malay word "dury," a thorn, in reference to the prickly
covering of the fruit. The leaves, which are a light, glossy green on
the upper surface, are alternate, entire, elliptical and acute. The
yellowish-white flowers are large. The fruit, which is either globular
or oval, sometimes measures 10 inches in length. It has a hard rind,
covered with thorny warts or spines, and externally looks not unlike a
breadfruit. When ripe, it is brownish-yellow, and, when opened at its
lower end, shows five longitudinal sections or cells, each containing
from 1 to 4 seeds about the size of a pigeon's egg. The edible pulp
surrounding the seeds is firm and cream-colored. The Durion is
remarkable for its combination of an absolutely delicious flavor and an
abominably offensive odor. To my knowledge there is but one tree in
bearing in the Hawaiian Islands, and that is growing in private grounds
at Lihue, Kauai.

  ARABIAN COFFEE.


The Coffee-tree is said to be a native of Abyssinia. Two species, the
Arabian and the Liberian, are now cultivated throughout the tropics. The
use of coffee was known in Arabia long before it was introduced to
Europeans in the sixteenth century. The Dutch were the first to
introduce the plant to Europe. The Arabian Coffee-tree is low-growing,
and bears one crop annually; its leaves are elliptico-oblong, acuminate,
generally from 3 to 6 inches long, and are thin and shiny. The white
flowers appear in clusters, and are very fragrant. The berries are
ovoid, fleshy, and bright red. In this berry are found the two seeds,
which constitute the coffee of commerce. The Coffee-tree was introduced
into Hawaii about 1823, by a Frenchman, who established a small
plantation in Manoa Valley, Oahu. The tree is now well naturalized in
the woods of Kona, Hawaii, and elsewhere in the Islands, and flourishes
up to an elevation of from 1000 to 2000 feet.

This species is a tall grower, is highly ornamental in foliage, and is a
rich bearer. Its leaves are from 6 to 12 inches long. The white flowers
come in dense clusters, and are more robust and productive than are
those of the Arabica. The berries are nearly spherical, and in color are
a dull crimson. The pulp is large in proportion to the size of the
seeds. Although this variety has not become popular in Hawaii, it is
claimed that it will grow at a much lower elevation than will the
Arabica, and the flavor is said to be very fine.

This odorous tree is a native of China. It is a symmetrical evergreen
with dense foliage. The light, mossy-green leaves are imparipinnate, the
leaflets ovate-repand, and they are rough on the under surface. The
flowers, which are borne in clusters, on the new wood, are small,
yellow, and very fragrant. The fruit ripens from June until October; it
is about the size of a gooseberry; the skin is yellowish-brown, shaded
with green. The pulp is sub-acid with a balsamic fragrance. It contains
one large seed about the size of a kernel of corn. There are two
varieties, the sweet and the sour; both may be eaten raw, and are very
highly prized by the Chinese. I know of but two trees of this kind in
the Hawaiian Islands; they are of the sour variety, and are growing in
private gardens in Honolulu.

This shrub, or bush, is a native of Brazil, but is naturalized in many
warm countries. It stands partially erect, reaching a height of from 11/2
to 3 feet. Its pointed leaves, heart-shaped at the base, are very fuzzy.
The open, bell-shaped flowers are yellow in color. The fruit, which is
about the size of a cherry, is enclosed in a thin, yellow, paper-like
husk, which is quite hairy. When ripe, the fruit is yellow, and has a
delicious sub-acid pulp, filled with minute seeds. The Poha may be eaten
raw, but is much more acceptable when made into jam or jelly. The dried
fruit is said to be a substitute for yeast. In Hawaii, the Poha thrives
best in the cool elevations.

  _Carica Papaya._

  PAPAYA (fruit, female tree).


The Papaya is a native of South America; it is found in Florida, and in
many parts of tropical America; it was early introduced into Hawaii,
grows and bears well in almost any locality. It is a small tree, with a
hollow, branchless trunk; it is short-lived, and is suitable only to
regions free from frost, and requires perfect drainage. There are two
forms, the tall and the dwarf, but there are numerous variations as to
shape and quality of the fruit. The soft green leaves, often measuring
two feet across, are variously palmated, and have simple, long, hollow
stems. The Papaya is usually dioceous; the fruit-bearing tree is called
the female; it is claimed that trees of both sexes should be planted
near each other, in order to ensure a good yield. The female flowers,
which appear from the axils of the leaves, are yellowish-white, single,
or two or three together.

The fruit of the Papaya ripens successively. It is either round or
oblong, and sometimes weighs eight pounds. The skin is thin, and is
bright yellow when ripe. The firm, yellow pulp has a delicious flavor,
and the milky juice contains a digestive principle similar to pepsin.
The seed cavity is large, and is filled with many small seeds which are
enveloped in a loose, mucous coat, with a brittle, pitted testa. When
fresh these seeds germinate readily.

This species of dwarf Papaya is of recent introduction to Hawaii. It has
a soft, hollow trunk, and low, spreading branches. The leaves are deeply
lobed, of a light green color on the upper side, and whitish-green
underneath. Flowers dioecious, yellowish-green, having five petals.
Fruit the size of a large olive, green, and ribbed with five white
stripes, changing to yellow when ripe. The yellow pulp, containing
numerous seeds, has a strong pesin flavor that is quite agreeable.

  CHINESE ORANGE.


This familiar and highly ornamental tree, commonly known as the Chinese
orange, was very early introduced to these Islands. It is well named
Hazara (meaning thousand of fruit), as it is one of the most prolific of
the citrus family, and both green and ripe fruit in great quantities may
be found on the same tree at almost any season of the year. The tree is
of medium size, and the small, shiny leaves have short petioles. It is
generally thornless. The flowers are white and fragrant. The round fruit
is a deep yellow, and its smooth skin is very loosely attached. The pulp
is also a deep yellow and contains many seeds, and the sour juice is
very plentiful. The tree is hardy and free from disease and scale.
Propagation is by seed.

  KUMQUAT.


The Kumquat is a native of Cochin-China, and is also cultivated in
Japan, Florida, and California. It is a low-growing bush or shrub,
having smooth, angular branches, and in both the round and oval
varieties the dark foliage is dense and beautiful. It is a very prolific
bearer. Its leaves are small, lanceolate, slightly serrate, pointed or
blunt and wedge-shaped at the base. The small, white flowers come
solitary or in clusters, the fruit varies in size from a large
gooseberry to that of a pigeon's egg, and is either ovate, oblong, or
spherical. It is 5 to 6 celled, has very little pulp, and contains many
seeds. The pulp is somewhat sour, especially in the round varieties; and
the smooth, thick, yellow rind is aromatic and sweet; the Kumquat is
generally preserved whole, and those prepared by the Chinese are very
delicious.

This ornamental citrus tree is not often seen in our gardens, for it is
subject to scale, and to the mealy bug, which destroy the flowers and
stunt the fruit. The Kumquat comes true to seed, and may also be
propagated by grafting and budding.

  MANDARIN ORANGE.


This small tree or thornless shrub with its dense foliage is a native of
Cochin-China, and fine specimens of this tree, with its golden fruit in
season, can be found in many gardens about Honolulu, especially those of
the Chinese. Its leaves are lanceolate, its petioles short. Flowers are
white and fragrant. The fruit is compressed-spherical, apex depressed, a
ridge about the stem. The thin peel is greenish-yellow, baggy, and
separates readily from the sections. Pulp generally dry, sweet, juice
scant, fruit containing many seeds. The characteristic odor of the
leaves, twigs and fruit of all varieties of the Mandarin orange is
easily recognizable.

  LIME.


This small tree or bush thrives in Hawaii, and yields good crops. It
requires a sandy, rocky soil, and does well in the shaded valleys.
However, it is attacked by scale pests and root fungus, and many
valuable trees are destroyed in this way. The dark green, shiny leaves
are oval or elliptical, and emit an agreeable odor when bruised. The
fragrant flowers are small, white, with an occasional tinge of pink. The
fruit is small, varying in shape from round to elliptical. The light
yellow skin is oily and very bitter, and the pulp is juicy and sour. The
picture representing this fruit shows several varieties, forms and
shapes: those on the left being the Mexican type, those on the upper
right the Kusai lime, the latter much resembling a mandarin orange in
shape, and has a loose skin, but the pulp is very juicy and exceedingly
sour. This lime has become very popular in Hawaii, grows readily from
seed, and produces true. To Mr. Henry Swinton is due the credit of
introducing this variety in 1885 from Kusai, or Strong's Island,
Micronesia.

  LEMON.


This is a spreading tree, having ovate-oblong, fragrant leaves with
short petioles. The flowers are small and white. The medium-sized fruit
is egg-shaped, ending in a nipple-like point. The thin, smooth skin is
aromatic. The juicy pulp is rich in citric acid. Many choice varieties
of lemons have been introduced to Hawaii, but they have not thrived
particularly well, because of the scale and insect pests which so
greedily attack them; eternal vigilance is necessary in order to get the
fruit matured; some very fine specimens, however, have been grown in
Kona, at an elevation of 1500 feet.

  ROUGH-SKIN LEMON.


This variety is very hardy, bears profusely, and requires much more
water than does the orange. Being a strong, vigorous grower, it forms an
excellent stock upon which to graft the citrus varieties. The flower is
white, with a reddish tint outside. The fruit is generally oval, and
contains many seeds. The pale yellow skin is rough and warty. The pulp
is coarse-grained and very juicy. It comes true to seed.

  WAIALUA ORANGE.


This tree, which grows to a height of from 20 to 35 feet, is cultivated
in all tropical and sub-tropical countries. Its young branches are pale
green, angular and glabrous. The leaves are oblong, ovate and pointed,
and the petioles are narrowly winged. Its flowers are white and very
fragrant. This variety of orange, locally known as the Waialua orange,
has a bright yellow fruit, generally round, with a coarse, thick skin,
very juicy pulp, and numerous seeds; and was introduced by Vancouver and
planted in Hanalei valley, Kauai. It is now widely disseminated
throughout the group, and in Kona, Hawaii, grows exceptionally well.
This orange is said to produce true to seed.

  BAHIA, OR WASHINGTON NAVEL ORANGE.


This variety was first introduced into the United States from Brazil,
and is now the most popular of all the oranges. It is cultivated
extensively in California, in which State the first trees of its kind
were planted; for this reason it is often called the Riverside Navel.
The fruit is large, solid, and heavy. It is seedless, and has a
prominent navel mark at the apex. The brilliant orange color of the skin
is one of its characteristics. Grafted and budded trees of this variety
of orange may be found growing in many localities in the Hawaiian
Islands, but the fruit is not as fine as it should be, as, with few
exceptions, it has a tendency to become very dry and woody.

  POMELO OR SHADDOCK (pear-shaped var.).


This hardy tree, with its spreading branches, grows to a height of from
15 to 20 feet. It is extensively cultivated in India, and widely
distributed over the Malayan and Polynesian Islands. It was early
introduced to the Hawaiian Islands, presumably by the Chinese, who seem
to be especially fond of the fruit, as it is always an important feature
of their New Year's decorations. The leaves are large, oval or
ovate-oblong, obtuse, and frequently emarginate, and the petiole is
broadly winged. The flowers are large and white. This pyriform variety,
which is from 6 to 8 inches in diameter, often weighs 4 to 8 pounds.

The pale-yellow rind is smooth, thick and very bitter, but can be made
into a preserve. The pulp varies in color from pale yellow to red, and
has a sub-acid, slightly bitter, flavor.

  BREADFRUIT (Hawaiian var.)

  "ULU."


The first breadfruit trees were brought from Tahiti by the Hawaiians
who, landing at Ewa, carried them across the mountain, and presented
them to one of the Chiefs of Oahu, who lived at Kualoa. There they were
planted and thrived. At the present day this variety of the breadfruit,
now called the Hawaiian variety, is to be found growing wild throughout
the Islands. There are many varieties of this handsome tree, which grows
to a height of from 15 to 40 feet. It thrives best in hot, moist places,
and requires a great deal of water.

Its large ovate leaves are rough and deeply lobed. The male flower is a
large yellow catkin. The fruit is formed from the female flowers, and is
attached to the branches by large stems. In shape it is either round or
oblong, varying in size from 5 to 8 inches in diameter. The thick, tough
rind is, in some varieties muricated, and in others it is reticulated.
In color it is green, changing to brownish when the fruit is ripe. The
pulp is firm, mealy, and somewhat fibrous, and as an article of diet is
much esteemed. Propagation is by suckers, or by layers from the
branches.

  BREADFRUIT (Samoan var.)


This variety was introduced to these Islands by Mr. James Bicknell. Its
large, oval leaves are leathery and rough, and less deeply lobed than
are those of the Hawaiian variety. The round fruit has a characteristic
raised ring where it is attached to the long stem. The yellowish-green
rind is reticulated, and the orange-colored pulp is somewhat sticky when
cooked, and is very sweet. This variety occasionally produces seed.

  JACK FRUIT.


This tree is a native of India and Malay. And was introduced to Hawaii
by Mr. David Forbes of Kukuihaele, Hawaii. The Jack fruit is a large,
handsome tree, with leaves from 4 to 6 inches in length, which on the
old growth are obovate-oblong and on the young branches are narrow. The
oblong, irregular fruit, which varies in weight from 20 to 60 pounds, is
borne on the trunk, as well as on the old branches. The green rind is
covered with small hexagonal knobs. The pulp when ripe has all
overpowering odor and is seldom eaten; but the oily seeds when roasted
are edible, and are said to resemble chestnuts. On Tantalus, Oahu, the
Jack fruit thrives well, and has produced fair sized fruits. It is a
tree that needs a great deal of moisture, and consequently is seldom
grown on the low lands.

  SOUR SOP.


This small, hardy evergreen tree is very common in Hawaii. Its dark
green, glabrous leaves are pointed, elliptical, and are shiny on the
upper surface, but rusty beneath. The greenish-yellow flowers are
usually solitary, and have a peculiar odor. The fruit is large, varying
in weight from 1 to 15 pounds. In shape, it is either oblong or conical
and blunt. The rough, dark green, shiny skin, which is irregular in
thickness, is studded with fleshy spines. The soft, white, cotton-like
pulp is divided into sections, each containing a shiny, black seed,
about half an inch long. These are very readily propagated.

  _Anona Cherimolia._

  CHERIMOYER.


The Cherimoyer, a well-known fruit of the tropics, is said to be a
native of Peru. It is naturalized in Central America, is hardy in the
mildest coast regions of Spain, and in Jamaica is cultivated up to an
elevation of nearly 5000 feet. It thrives on the Florida Keys, and is
also grown to a limited extent in Southern California. The tree grows to
a height of from 10 to 20 feet; its branches are spreading, and the
dark, shiny leaves are either ovate or oblong, and are sparsely hairy
above and velvety beneath.

The single petaled, velvety-green flowers are very fragrant. The fruit,
which is about the size of a large orange, is heart-shaped and slightly
flattened at the stem end. When ripe, the skin is a greyish-green, and
is covered with slightly-raised semicircular markings. The white pulp,
which is soft and rich, is divided into cells, each containing a black
seed about the size of an ordinary bean. The Cherimoyer comes true to
seed and bears in about three years. It is one of the most delicious
fruits, and its delicate, slightly-acid flavor is very characteristic.
The Cherimoyer was one of the earliest fruits introduced to these
Islands, and the best specimens of its kind are grown in Kona and Kau,
Hawaii, where it continues to propagate itself naturally from seed.

  CUSTARD APPLE.


This tree, which is not common in Hawaii, is rather delicate, and grows
to a height of from 10 to 15 feet. It is a native of the Antilles, and
is a very popular tree in the West Indies. It thrives in Southern
California. Its leaves, which are either lanceolate or oblong and
pointed, are glabrous above and rough beneath. In color they are light
green and rather brittle, when bruised they emit a very unpleasant odor.

The flowers are three-petaled and are greenish or yellowish, with purple
spots at the base. Artificial pollination will induce the flowers to set
and produce better crops. The heart-shaped fruit is from 3 to 5 inches
in diameter. The skin is smooth, with small depressions; when ripe, it
is a pinkish-yellow and shading to a russet. Next to the skin the pulp
is soft and creamy-yellow, while toward the center it is quite white.
The flavor is sweet and delicious. There are numerous smooth, black
seeds. This fruit, like its cousin the Cherimoyer grows true to seed.

  SUGAR APPLE--SWEET SOP.


This small tree is native of the West Indies, from which country the
plants found growing in many of our gardens in these Islands were
imported. The thin leaves are ovate-oblong, and are very slightly hairy
on both sides. The greenish flowers are about an inch long. The fruit
which is from 3 to 4 inches in diameter, is the shape of a pine cone; it
is greenish-yellow when ripe, and each carpel forms a slight
protuberance. The sweet, creamy-white pulp is very delicious. There are
numerous small smooth, brownish-black seeds, which germinate readily,
and the plants bear fruit in from two to four years. This variety of
anona is sensitive to drought, and thrives well at the high elevations.

The Guava is an extensive genus of low-growing evergreen trees, found
chiefly in the West Indies, South America, and China. They have become
naturalized in Hawaii, and may be found growing wild on waste lands and
by the roadside. In some localities growing so rank as to become
troublesome. The leaves are oval to oblong, usually acuminate, glabrous
above and pubescent beneath, and have prominent veins. The fragrant,
white, solitary flowers are axillary.

The somewhat rough skin of the globose fruit is a brownish-yellow, and
the firm, dark-pink pulp, in which is embedded numerous seeds, is
generally acid and aromatic. This guava is the source of the famous
guava jelly of commerce.

  MANGO.


The mango, which is a native of South Asia, is extensively cultivated
throughout India, the Islands of the West Indies, and somewhat in
Florida. In Hawaii it has become thoroughly naturalized, and is one of
the most common trees; growing from the sea level up to about 1,000
feet.

A hot, rather dry, climate, with well-drained soil suits it best. It is
an evergreen, shady tree of quick growing habit, sometimes reaching a
height of 70 feet, and having a round, dense top. All parts of the mango
tree have a resinous fragrance, that suggests turpentine. Its thick,
shiny leaves are from 6 to 10 inches in length. The greenish, scented
flowers are borne in large terminal panicles; and these are followed
three or four months later by the fruit, which is large and
kidney-shaped, having a smooth, rather soft, pale-green skin, with tints
of yellow and red. The large seed is nearly as long as the fruit, its
shell is rough and fibrous, and the kernel is shaped like a bean. In the
inferior varieties of mangoes the pulp is full of fibre and tastes
strongly of turpentine. There are numerous varieties of the mango
cultivated in Hawaii; the fruit of which varies much in point of flavor,
juiciness, as well as in the size and shape of the seed.

Within the past ten years improved varieties have been imported; notably
the Alphonse, Cambodiana, Pirie, and many others. These have thrived
well and have borne delicious fruit; from them many grafts have been
made and the finer grades of mangoes have been disseminated. Propagation
is effected by seed, by grafting or inarching, and by budding. The mango
as a rule does not come true to seed; also seedlings take much longer to
fruit than do the grafted trees.

The illustration on the opposite page is that of the so-called common
mango, which was brought to Hawaii from Mexico.

This tree is supposed to be the first mango tree brought to the Hawaiian
Islands. It was planted in the early part of the nineteenth century by
Don Marin, whom the Hawaiians familiarly called "Manini." He brought to
Hawaii many useful trees and plants; among the number was this mango,
which he planted in his vineyard, then known as "Ka Pa Waina," and there
it may be found today; a venerable tree standing about 80 feet high,
having a spread of over 100 feet, and its trunk measuring 15 feet in
circumference. Although a prolific bearer, its fruits, which are borne
in large clusters, are small, and of an inferior quality, having a thick
skin and a large, hairy seed.

the Government Nursery, Honolulu, was brought from Jamaica by Joseph
Marsden, Esq. This tree is a prolific bearer, and its seeds have been
widely distributed throughout these Islands. The fruit is large and
regular in size, having a thick skin which is of a light-green color.
The pulp is pale yellow, very juicy, and slightly acid. There is a very
large, hairy seed.

  BANANA--"MAIA."


The banana, which has been cultivated from the most remote times, is a
plant of great importance in tropical and sub-tropical climates, where
its highly nutritious fruit is used as food. It is a large herbaceous,
slightly shrubby, plant of very easy growth, having immense,
gracefully-arching, undivided leaves. There are numerous varieties, the
fruit of which differs in shape, color and flavor.

As decorative plants in landscape gardening, few subjects equal the
choice species of the banana; and on account of its utility, combined
with its beauty, it is considered one of the most valuable of tropical
products. Propagation is by off-shoots or suckers. When a stalk is cut,
the fruit of which has ripened, sprouts are put forth which in time bear
fruit. The enormous flower stalk issues from the center of the crown of
leaves, and curves over with its own weight.

The flowers are arranged in a dense terminal panicle; they alternate
with large, reddish scales, which drop off as the fruit stalk develops,
and the finger-like fruits are in clusters. The Hawaiians seem to have
possessed the banana from the earliest times, and about fifty varieties
were known to the older natives. However, since the year 1855, the
so-called Chinese banana (_Musa Cavendishii_), which was at that time
introduced from Tahiti, has crowded out the native varieties, many of
which are now extinct.

  "NONI."


This species is found in nearly all the Pacific Islands. The date of its
introduction to Hawaii, however, is not recorded. It is a small tree
which grows in the low lands. Its shiny, oval leaves have short
petioles. The white flowers are about 1 inch in length. The fruit is
whitish-yellow when mature, and when decaying it emits a very offensive
odor. The seeds are interesting because they will float a great length
of time in salt water, their buoyancy is caused by a distinct air cell.

  "OHELO."


This is an erect dwarf shrub growing to a height of from one to two
feet, having stiff, crowded branches with leaves varying in form, from
oblong to obovate, and in color from green to green tinged with yellow
and red. The white flowers are solitary, and come mostly in the axils of
the true leaves. The globose fruit is a fleshy, shiny berry, much
resembling the cranberry; in color it is yellow or pale rose, and is
covered with a waxy bloom.

The Ohelo thrives best in the higher elevations, from 4000 to 8000 feet.
It grows particularly well on the mountain slopes of Hawaii and Maui. It
is an edible berry, and is the principal food of the rare Hawaiian
goose, now to be found in only a few localities. The Ohelo has always
been a favorite subject of Hawaiian songs and legends, and was used as
one of the offerings to the Goddess Pele.

The first illustration on the opposite page is that of the currant
tomato; an annual found growing wild in great profusion in the low lands
of our valleys. It is of weak growth, very diffuse and twiggy, and
scarcely pubescent. Its obovate leaves are small with nearly entire
leaflets, and very small secondary leaflets; the elongated racemes bear
from 100 to 40 small, currant-like red berries, which are very sweet.

The second illustration is that of the grape tomato, which has
grayish-green leaves and slender, ascending stems. The leaves are
pinnate with small, nearly entire leaflets; the main leaflets are
notched or even lobed toward the base. The fruit is a bright red berry
about half an inch in diameter, and is fresh and aromatic.

This glabrous, annual, growing from 1 to 2 feet in height, is Common to
most tropical countries, and in Hawaii was probably of aboriginal
introduction; as the Hawaiians have many ways of using the fruits and
the leaves, for medicinal purposes. This plant is found on waste land,
in old pastures, and by the roadside. Its ovate leaves are dark green.
The whitish flowers are small, and the fruit is a small, shiny, black
berry.

  CANDLENUT TREE--"KUKUI NUT."


The Kukui tree is easily recognizable from afar off by the pale hue of
its foliage, which appears to be dusted over with flour. It is a
handsome, soft wood, evergreen tree, growing to a height of from 40 to
60 feet, and is widely spread over tropical Polynesia, and a great part
of Malaysia; and by all branches of the Polynesian race it is called by
the same name: Kukui or Tutui. The Hawaiians tattooed their skins with a
black dye which they prepared from the juice which is found in the
fleshy covering of the green fruit. The leaves are alternate, 3 to 5
lobed, pubescent, and have long petioles. The yellowish-green flowers
are in terminal clusters. The fruit is spherical, from 1 to 2 inches in
diameter, and light-green in color, changing to a dull-brown when ripe.
It contains one or more nuts, or seeds, which have a very hard, boney
shell, the surface of which is uneven like the shell of a walnut. The
kernels of this nut, when dried, were strung together, or bound on
sticks, and served the natives for torches or candles: thus the English
name of Candlenut Tree. The oil obtained from the nut was used by the
Hawaiians for burning in stone lamps. The kernel, when baked, pounded,
and mixed with salt and Chili peppers, makes a brown paste which is very
appetizing. This is much esteemed by the Hawaiians, who call it
"Inamona."

  "KAMANI."


This deciduous tree, generally called Kamani by the Hawaiians, with its
spreading branches in horizontal whorls or layers, is one of the
familiar and useful shade trees of these Islands. Leaves large,
opposite, broadly obovate-obtuse, very short petioled, and turning
brilliant shades of red and yellow during the autumn. Flowers
greenish-white on long spikes, upper ones staminate, the lower ones
perfect. The almond-shaped fruit is a compressed hard, nut-like body 1
to 11/2, inches long, with a thin outer covering which is sweet, and
spongy. There is generally one, sometimes two, small, edible kernels
found embedded in the hard body. These may be eaten raw, or roasted.

This Kamani is a large tropical tree, having shiny, leathery, evergreen
foliage. Its leaves are obovate, usually marginate, and its white
flowers are very fragrant. The fruit, which generally comes in clusters,
is round, about the size of a large walnut, and has a thin, leathery
skin which covers a boney shell, inside of which is a corky substance
surrounding the seed or kernel. This tree was an early introduction to
these Islands, and is commonly seen on our seacoasts.

  JAPANESE CHESTNUT.


This is a close-headed tree of slender growth, attaining a height of
from 30 to 50 feet. Its leaves are smaller than those of other
chestnuts, generally from 3 to 7 inches long, and are either rounded at
the base or reduced to a long, bristle-like point. The monoecious
flowers are arranged in long catkins. The small burs have a thin, papery
lining, and short, widely-branching spines. The nuts are large and
glossy, usually three in a bur. They are somewhat inferior in quality,
but are palatable when cooked.

To my knowledge there is but one tree of this variety growing in these
Islands, and it is to be found on the slopes of Tantalus, where it was
planted by the Department of Agriculture.

  TAHITIAN CHESTNUT.


This tree, which is said to be a native of the Moluccas, is an evergreen
of very rapid growth. Its straight trunk, with smooth, ashen-grey bark,
its spreading branches, with their dense green foliage, make a very
ornamental as well as useful tree. Its leaves are alternate and simple.
The small, fragrant, pale yellow flowers are very numerous. The drupe is
obliquely oval, and about the size of a goose egg, containing a large
kernel which is edible when roasted, but is not especially palatable.
The only trees of this variety growing in Hawaii are to be found at
Ahuimanu Ranch, Oahu, where they fruit regularly, and the seeds
germinate after being in the ground some months.

the Philippines, and from any one of those countries may have been
introduced to Hawaii. A fine specimen may be seen at the Government
Nursery, Honolulu. Its leaves are alternate, odd pinnate. The small
flowers come in terminal panicles. The fruit or nut is ellipsoidal. The
thick skin, which is purple-colored when ripe, covers a hard,
three-lobed stone, which differs from a pecan nut only in that it is
sharp at each end. The kernel is small, sweet and edible. Trees
propagated from the mature nuts.

This sub-tropical Australian tree sometimes grows to a height of 60
feet, but in Hawaii is of medium size. It is symmetrical and handsome,
having dark green, shiny foliage, and long tassel-like white flowers.
Its glabrous leaves are sessile, oblong, lanceolate, serrate, with fine
prickly teeth, and come in whorls of 3 to 4, varying in length from a
few inches to a foot. Flowers small; fruit has a thick, very hard shell,
which when ripe is a smooth, shiny brown. The kernel is white, crisp and
sweet, and has the flavor of hazel nuts. It may be eaten either raw or
roasted. The tree matures its fruit in the Fall months, and is easily
propagated from the fresh nuts.

  BHEL OR BAEL FRUIT.


This small spinose tree is a native of tropical Asia, and although not
commonly grown in Hawaii, specimens may be found in several gardens. It
has alternate trifoliolate leaves, and flowers, which grow in clusters,
are small and fragrant. The gourd-like fruit, with its hard shell, is
from 2 to 4 inches in diameter, and is either round or pear-shaped, and
although heavy and solid, it will float in water. The rind, when ripe,
is a yellowish-brown color, and is studded with oil cells. The interior
surface of the skin is lined with open-mouthed cells, which pour their
gummy secretions into the interior of the carpel, filling it and bathing
the seed. The pulp is sweet and aromatic, and is esteemed for making
conserves, and also as a cooling drink.

In India, the roots and leaves are used medicinally. Bael gum is a
sticky, astringent substance soluble in water. The fruit contains
several large, flat, woolly seeds, which germinate readily, and the
plant is also very easily propagated from root cuttings.

This is an evergreen tree rarely found in Hawaii. It has alternate,
irregular, long, narrow leaves, shiny dark-green on the upper side, a
velvety light-green on the underside, and has a long petiole. The
branches are brittle, light-green, smooth and shiny when young, and
after the leaves shed become woody and inclined to dry back.

The trunk and bark of the tree is covered with warty excresences. The
solitary flowers are four-petaled. The edible fruit ripens in December,
is round, depressed, about 21/2 inches in diameter, in color light-green
dotted with numerous white spots. When quite ripe the thin skin turns to
a shiny-brown. The soft chocolate colored pulp is sweet and contains
from 1 to 8 large flat seeds.

one or two gardens in Honolulu. Its leaves are elliptic-obovate,
resembling those of the mango. The yellow flowers are single, the fruit
is the size and shape of a hen's egg, and has the flavor of the yolk of
an egg sweetened with sugar. It has from one to three large seeds, which
are easily germinated.

  LOQUAT.


The Loquat has been for many years a familiar fruit in our gardens, and
is a native of China and Japan. It is a low evergreen tree with thick
foliage, and in congenial climates is a profuse bearer. Its leaves are
thick, oblong, and remotely toothed and grow near the ends of the
branches. The white flowers grow in clusters, are very fragrant, and the
fruit, which also ripens in clusters, about Christmas time, is
pear-shaped, and has an agreeable acid flavor. The seeds are large, and
germinate readily. Fine grafted and budded varieties have been
introduced by local horticulturalists.

  "LICHEE."


This tree, with its dense foliage, is a native of Southern China. The
first tree of this variety was brought to Hawaii by Mr. Afong, and
planted at his residence in Nuuanu avenue, Honolulu, in the year 1870.

The leaves are alternate, and abruptly pinnate; the oblong leaflets are
not quite opposite. Flowers pale green, small and regular, producing
bunches of reddish-colored fruits, each about the size of a small
walnut. They are covered with a parchment-like skin having many soft
spines. The interior consists of a large seed covered with a whitish
pulp of a sweetish acid flavor; this pulp when dried in the shell
becomes somewhat shriveled, brownish in color, and very sweet.

The fruiting season is in July, and as there are but few trees here that
bear, high prices are obtained for this rare fruit, which is much prized
by the Chinese. Fresh seeds will germinate, but it requires so many
years for these seedlings to bear that grafted and budded plants are
imported from China.

  LONGAN.


This tree is a native of India and Southern China. It produces its
flowers and fruits at about the same time of year as does the Litchi,
which it somewhat resembles, although its fruits are somewhat smaller
and less palatable. The tree grows to a height of about 20 feet. It has
large, alternate, pinnate leaves, and the oblong leaflets are not quite
opposite; they are glossy on the upper surface, and a dusty-brown on the
underside. The small flowers come in terminal panicles; and the fruit,
which is borne in clusters, has a thin, brittle, somewhat rough shell.
There is one large, smooth, hard seed; around which is a thin layer of
sweetish, aromatic pulp. The best fruits raised here are those grown by
the Chinese.

  MANGOSTEEN.


This tree is a native of Sumatra and of the Islands of the Eastern
Archipelago. It is of medium size, the stem rising to a height of about
20 feet; and its branches coming out in regular order give the head of
the tree the form of a parabola. The leaves are about 8 inches long and
4 inches broad at the middle; they are a beautiful green on the upper
side and a delicate olive on the under side. The flowers resemble a
single rose with dark-red petals. The fruit is round, about the size of
a small orange, and has a characteristic persistent calyx. The shell is
at first green, and when ripe changes to purplish-brown marked with
yellow spots. The Mangosteen is called the queen of fruits, and the tree
upon which it is produced is most graceful and beautiful.

Those who have tasted this fruit in its perfection declare it to be
indescribably delicious. The Mangosteen must have a hot, moist, and
fairly equable climate throughout the year.

Many Mangosteen trees have been brought to Hawaii, and have received
intelligent care, but they have not thrived well; and have eventually
died. Only two have ever produced fruit; one in the garden of Mr.
Francis Gay of Kauai, which bears its fruit annually, and the other tree
at Lahaina, Maui, in the garden formerly the property of Mr. Harry
Turton.

This handsome tree is a native of India, and was first introduced to
Hawaii by Mr. Albert Jaeger. It has long, narrow, leathery leaves of a
bright, glossy green. The flowers, which have four petals, appear at the
axil of the leaves, and the fruit, which is about the size of a small
quince, has a smooth, thin skin, which is yellow when ripe. The firm
pulp is golden yellow, very juicy, and sour, and the seeds are large.
This variety is common in the Islands, and has often been mistaken for
the Mangosteen. It ripens its fruit in October and November. This
variety has been used to inarch the garcina mangostana upon.

edible, but not especially palatable. It is a small tree having terete
branches, and its opposite leaves are oblong-elliptical, dark-green
above and a lighter, somewhat glossy-green beneath. The petioles are
short. The axillary inflorescence comes in long, slender cymes, and the
five-petaled flowers are yellow. When ripe, the obovate fruit is a

rose-colored flowers are axillary and five-petaled. The bright red fruit
is about the size of a cherry, and has a thin skin, and its acid pulp is
used for jam and preserves. The seeds or stones are large, four-angled,
and germinate readily; plants are also produced by cuttings. Though not

  CHOCOLATE, COCOA.


In Hawaii this tropical tree grows to a height of from 10 to 30 feet. It
has large, pointed leaves, and the new growth is wine-colored. The
flowers appear on the trunk and mature branches, and the fruit which
follows is about 8 to 12 inches long, and is called the pod; inside of
this pod are beans or seeds, from which the commercial product called
cocoa is made, through a process of drying and curing. Chocolate is the
term used for the sweetened preparations of the roasted and ground
beans, with a large proportion of the original fat retained. Cocoa
preparations are the same material in fine powder, sweetened and
unsweetened, with a greater part of the fat extracted.

Cacao cultivation has never been successfully attempted in Hawaii.
However, a few isolated trees can be found at Ahuimanu Ranch, Oahu,
where they were planted by the Catholic brothers as an experiment some
years ago.

The Monstera deliciosa, one of the grandest of arid plants, is a native
of the mountainous regions of Guatamala and Brazil. It climbs to a
height of 12 or more feet, and its leaf stalks are often 3 feet long. It
obtains nourishment from the tree upon which it attaches itself. Its
leaves are huge and perforated. As the plant climbs, the stems emit
aerial roots, many of which never reach the ground. The fruit which has
the appearance of an elongated pine-cone, grows to a length of from 6 to
12 inches, and is about 21/2 inches in diameter.

The rind is composed of plates which may be detached when the fruit is
quite ripe. It is green in color until it ripens, when there appears a
slight tinge of yellow. The creamy-white pulp has a most delicious
flavor, somewhat resembling the banana, and also like the pineapple. It
requires 18 months to mature the fruit. Propagation is by cuttings.

This spreading tree is a native of the West Indies; and although it is
seen in several gardens of our Islands, it is not common. The first tree
of its kind was planted by Mr. Henry Davis in his grounds at Punahou.
The tree grows to a height of from 15 to 20 feet. The light-green,
leathery leaves are oval and rough, its pink flowers have a peculiar,
strong fragrance. The fruit consists of two distinct parts; the
heart-shaped nut or seed and the fleshy, pear-shaped receptacle to which
it is attached. This receptacle is from 2 to 4 inches long, is either
red or yellow, and is very juicy and astringent. The nut or seed is
edible when roasted. It is much appreciated in the West Indies. While
being roasted the fumes are said to be poisonous.

pinnate, the obtuse leaflets growing close together, and are from
one-half to three-fourths of an inch in length. Its minute flowers are
greenish-yellow. The round, six-striated fruit is smooth and fleshy, and
three-fourths to one inch in diameter. The seeds are enclosed in three
or more obovate cells, each cell containing two seeds. The pulp is hard
and bitter, but when cooked makes an excellent preserve.

  OLIVE.


The Olive, which is a native of Southwestern Asia, is not a tree of any
great height, but is very longlived, and yields prolifically. Although
not cultivated to any extent, the Olive has been growing in Hawaii for
many years. However, it has fruited only in a few favorable localities,
and nothing has ever been done to test its value commercially.

The tree thrives best in a warm, dry atmosphere, where the soil is rich
and well drained. Long-continued droughts so detrimental to most plants
will affect the Olive but slightly. The tree requires judicious pruning
immediately after the fruit is gathered, when the sap is comparatively
at rest. The small, thick leaves are lanceolate, opposite, and usually
entire; they are dull green above and silvery beneath. The small white
flowers, which come in panicles, are usually imperfect. The fruit is a
small, ellipsoid drupe, which is bluish-black when ripe. Its oil is an
important product. The Olive may be propagated from seeds, cuttings,
layers, suckers and pieces of the old stumps. The seeds require some
time to germinate, and the growth of the young plant is slow.

  "ISABELLA GRAPE."


This variety of grape was early introduced to these Islands, and has
become very popular. It is a hardy vine, variable in productiveness, and
is practically the only grape grown in any quantity in Hawaii. The
leaves are of medium size, often roundish and thick; their upper surface
is dark-green, the under surface is whitish-green. The Isabella is an
attractive blue-black grape, bearing in large, well-formed clusters,
having a thick bloom. The muskiness of the thick skin is somewhat
objectionable.

  SAND PEAR.


This tree is a vigorous and clean grower, having strong, thick shoots,
beautiful foliage, and very ornamental fruit. The dark-green leaves are
broadly ovate, and long-pointed, with their margins thickly furnished
with very sharp, almost bristle-like teeth. The large white flowers
appear rather in advance of the leaves. The fruit is hard and rough,
about 21/2 inches in diameter, with generally a depression about the stem.
The flesh is tough and gritty, but is very delicious when baked.
Propagation is by cuttings.

  GRANADILLA VINE.


This tall, strong climber is a native of tropical America. Its leaves
are broadly ovate, and the strong stems are purplish in color. The
large, interesting flowers are from 3 to 5 inches across. The sepals are
linear and violet shaded, the petals are very narrow and lilac. The many
rows of filaments in the crown are violet with bars of white below the
middle, the inner and shorter set being deep violet. The oblong fruit
attains a size from 5 to 9 inches in length, and in color is a pale,
yellowish green. The succulent, edible pulp of its hollow center has an
agreeable sub-acid flavor, and contains many flat seeds. This vine bears
well where there are bees; artificial fertilization also increases the
number of its fruits.

  PURPLE WATER LEMON.

  "LILIKOI."


This strong, woody vine is native of Brazil, and is naturalized in most
tropical countries. Its first introduction to these islands was at
Lilikoi, district of Makawao, Maui, whence its native name. Its serrate
leaves are large and deeply three-lobed; the white flowers are tinted
with purple. The fruit is oblong, globular, and when ripe is purple in
color; its shell-like skin is thick and crisp. The orange-colored edible
pulp is very fragrant, and is filled with small seeds, which germinate
readily.

  YELLOW WATER LEMON.


This strong-growing, glabrous vine, climbing by tendrils, is a native of
tropical America. The date when it was introduced to Hawaii, and by
whom, is not known; but in the Hilo and Hamakua districts of Hawaii this
variety grows wild. Its thick leaves are oval, oblong and entire, and
have a short, sharp point. The flowers are about 21/2, inches across, are
white, with red spots on them. The fruit is slightly oblong, 2 inches in
diameter, and very regular in size and shape. When ripe, it is yellow
spotted with white. It has a medium-hard shell or skin, and the edible
pulp is whitish-yellow, and contains many flat, black seeds.

  _Passiflora alata._


This is a strong, vigorous vine, very suitable for arbors and trellises.
It is not commonly found in Hawaii; however, a very fine specimen of its
kind is growing in Dr. St. D. G. Walter's garden in Honolulu. The leaves
are oval to ovate, the petioles having two glands. The fragrant purple
flowers are about two inches in diameter. The ovoid-pointed fruit has a
tough, leathery shell which, when green, is six-striated, with white
stripes; when quite ripe the fruit is a dull orange-yellow. The numerous
seeds are imbedded in the juicy, scented pulp, which is aromatic and
delicious. Propagation is by seed and by cuttings.

  _Passiflora, var. foetida._


This strong and hardy vine grows well on arbors and trellises. Its
leaves are three-cleft, and have long petioles; and spiral tendrils
spring from the axils. The single, pale-green flowers are surrounded by
a green, lace-like covering. The fruit is nearly globular, and slightly
pointed; it is about three-fourths of an inch in diameter, and when ripe
is a bright scarlet.

  NIGHT-BLOOMING CEREUS.


Although this plant with its wonderful nocturnal blossoms may be found
growing almost everywhere in the Islands, the best specimens of its kind
may be seen on the stone walls of Oahu College. The beautiful creamy
flowers with their yellow centers are large, about a foot long, and when
in full bloom about the same in diameter. The tube is covered with
large, leaf-like green scales. The fruit, which is about 31/2 inches long
and 2 inches in diameter, is covered with persistent, large, fleshy
scales which are scarlet colored when ripe, and the interior pulp is
edible and refreshing. Fruit, however, upon the night-blooming cereus in
Hawaii is rather rare, although a few fine specimens have matured.

  SAUSAGE TREE.


This medium-sized and very handsome shade tree is a native of tropical
Africa. It was probably introduced to Hawaii by Dr. Hillebrand. A fine
tree of this species is growing in Mrs. Foster's garden, Nuuanu avenue.
It has large pinnate leaves, and panicles of purple flowers. The
peculiar rough, grey, oblong fruits hang from a long stem, and present
an odd appearance. This tree and also one other of the same variety
growing in the grounds of the Queen's Hospital, very rarely set their
fruit. Because of the difficulty of obtaining seeds, the sausage tree
has not been widely distributed.

  THE DATE PALM.


The date, which is a native of North Africa, Arabia, and Persia, is a
noble palm, often growing to a height of from 80 to 100 feet. It is of
remarkable longevity, and will continue to produce fruit even at the age
of a hundred years. The neighborhood of the sea is considered
unfavorable to their production, although they will luxuriate in saltish
soil and bear well when brackish water is used.

Many varieties of dates exist, the fruit differing in shape, size and
color. They will grow from seeds, although the superior varieties can be
continued only from off-shoots of the root. These will commence to bear
in five years. In Asia, the growers of the commercial date find it
necessary to pollinate artificially by hanging sprays of the male
flowers in the branches of the fruit-bearing trees. There are no
imported trees bearing in Hawaii, and although there are many date trees
in Honolulu, artificial pollination would doubtless greatly increase the
yield and the quality of the fruit.

The accompanying cut shows fruit from two of the best date trees in
Honolulu, and it is curious to note that both of them were grown from
seeds taken from packages of dried dates purchased from a local grocer.

  _Acrocomia sp._


This interesting palm is seldom seen in Hawaii; there being but two
specimens of its kind that have produced fruit in Honolulu. Its stem is
capitately thickened at the persistent bases of the armed petioles. The
glaucous leaves are pari-pinnate with narrow, lanceolate, accuminate
segments, having a prominent mid-rib.

The inflorescence is simple and branching. The fruit is arranged similar
to that of Cocos, each about three-fourths of an inch in diameter,
sub-globose with a pointed apex. When ripe, it is a bright yellow, and
its juicy, edible pulp has the flavor of apricots.

  COCOANUT PALM.

  "NIU."


The original home of this widely-diffused tree is not positively known.
Some writers say it is indigenous to the islands of the Indian Ocean;
others show that in all probability it is of American origin. On account
of its buoyant husk and impervious shell, it was enabled to drift across
the oceans without losing its germinating power, and in this manner was
widely dispersed. It is strictly a tropical plant, and grows naturally
on the seashore, or in its immediate vicinity.

It has pinnate leaves about 12 to 18 feet long, and the inflorescence
first appears in a cylindrical sheath, which splits length-wise,
exposing long sprays of male flowers, and near the base generally one
female flower, which is much larger, and eventually develops into a
fruit. The picture shows both forms of flowers, as well as a young nut,
and also a mature cocoanut. Propagation is by means of the nut alone,
which must be thoroughly ripe before planting. The outer husk must be
left on, germination taking place at the largest eye; sometimes two eyes
may sprout, and twin trees grow from these. Many varieties have been
imported from islands of the Pacific, Ceylon, West Indies, and Central
America. The cocoanut is not raised in Hawaii for commercial purposes.

  CLAMMY CHERRY.


This low tree, with its spreading branches, is a native of the West
Indies, and is rarely met with in these Islands; there being but two
trees of its kind known to me, one growing at the Old Plantation,
Honolulu, the other at Honouliuli Ranch, Oahu. The whitish branches are
very brittle. The leaves are obovate, oblong, glabrous above and shiny
beneath. The subsessile flowers are whiteish-purple. The fruit, which is
half inch in diameter, is bluntly pointed and smooth. The fleshy pulp is
sticky, and adheres to the single seed. This plant may be grown from
seeds and from cuttings.

  _Flacourtia cataphracta._


This tree, which is a native of the Malay Islands and China, was
introduced to Hawaii by Mr. Albert Jaeger. There is but one tree which
has borne fruit; this is growing at the Old Plantation, Honolulu, Oahu.
The tree, which is about 25 feet high, has dense foliage; the leaves are
small, oblong, lanceolate, glabrous, having short petioles. Flowers very
small, dioceous; the fruit about the size of a common grape, is purple
when ripe, and has a pleasant sub-acid flavor. It contains a few flatish
seeds.

  _Atalantia buxifolia._


This small tree of dwarfish habit is from tropical Asia. It is closely
related to the orange, and has large thorns. Its simple leaves are
alternate, coriaceous, emarginate, and from 1 to 11/2 inches in length.
The petioles are short. The small, solitary flowers have five petals.
The berry is globose and three-quarters of an inch in diameter. When
ripe, it is a shiny black, and has a thick skin. The pulp has somewhat
the flavor of a lime, and the seeds are generally 1 to 5 in number. The
only specimens of this tree in Hawaii are growing in the garden of Mrs.
Foster; they, presumably, were introduced by Dr. Hillebrand, as these
gardens formerly belonged to him.

This large shrub is a native of India. Its alternate, entire, obovate
leaves have short petioles; they are glabrous and are about 4 to 8
inches in length. The small flowers are light pink. The small, globose
fruits grow in bunches; these are purple when ripe, but are not edible.
The only tree of its kind in Honolulu is growing in the grounds of the
Queen's Hospital.

  _Ochrosia elliptica._


This plant grows in the Pacific Islands, Malay Peninsula, Ceylon, and
Australia; and on account of its handsome scarlet fruit is cultivated as
an ornament, as the fruit is not edible. The tree is a small evergreen,
having alternate, glabrous, coriaceous leaves which are crowded at the
ends of the stout branches. The small, white flowers have five petals.
The fruit consists usually of two, rarely one, spreading scarlet drupes,
each containing a large seed. The first specimen of its kind in Hawaii
was planted at the Government Nursery, Honolulu, where it is still
growing.

  PINEAPPLE.


This variety of the pineapple plant was grown at an early date in these
Islands, and until the new and spineless forms were introduced was the
only quality offered in the fruit markets. It is now cultivated but
little, and is often found growing wild. The rosette at the head of the
fleshy fruit has numerous thorny leaves. The fruit is much smaller than
those of the thornless varieties, but it has a very sweet flavor.

  PRICKLY PEAR--"PANINI."


This erect, wide-spreading plant was early introduced to these Islands
from Mexico. It thrives well in arid lands, and in times of drought its
succulent, fleshy leaves and juicy fruit are eaten by cattle. The
plants, when old, become hard and woody, having many stout spines. The
large flowers are reddish-yellow, and the obovate, truncate fruit is a
purplish-red, having a thick fibrous skin, which is covered with fine
bristles. The edible pulp is reddish-purple and contains numerous
seeds.

  _Prosopis juliflora._

  ALGAROBA--"KIAWE."


The Kiawe deserves a special mention in this book, as it is, in my
opinion, one of the most valuable and beautiful trees that grows in the
Hawaiian Islands. Perhaps on account of its very general dissemination,
and because of the ease with which it spreads spontaneously, even in the
driest districts, it has received less consideration than has been
accorded to other plants more difficult of propagation.

The Kiawe is the foundation of all the beauty of our lowlands, and
provides a delicate background for other plants. Under favorable
circumstances, it reaches to a height of 50 feet. It has wide-spreading
branches and delicate-green foliage. The flowers yield a delicious
honey, and the seed-pods furnish a valuable fodder, and, finally, when
the tree is cut down, its wood makes the very best of fuel. The Algaroba
is a native of Central and South America. Ordinarily it is a
moderate-sized tree of quick and easy growth. Its branches in most cases
are covered with stout, cylindrical, axillary spines, and in other cases
they are unarmed.

The abruptly bi-pinnate leaves have from 6 to 30 pairs of linear
leaflets about one-fourth to one inch in length. The small, pale-yellow
flowers come in cylindrical spikes. The straight or sickle-shaped
seed-pod is sweet, and is eaten by stock. Propagation is by seed.

The first Algaroba tree of Hawaii was brought to Honolulu in 1828 by
Father Bachelot, founder of the Roman Catholic Mission in the Islands.
It was planted in the Mission garden, where the venerable tree is
standing today.

Detailed Transcriber's Notes.


General Notes.

The relative size of items noted in the captions of the Plates relates
to the original book, not to this document. Scaling of the images in
preparation of this e-book and the size and resolution of the media on
which the e-book is read make general statements about the relative
size of the pictured items impossible.

The "Index" was completely reworked so that it reflects the titles
and captions within the body of the book. The original style was
maintained. Details of changes to the "Index" are omitted. The page
number indicates the Plate, not the text preceding it.

The text of the book varies from the original in that obvious
misprints have been fixed. Where the intent of the misprint was not
obvious, it has been left in place and noted below. Use of archaic and
unusual words, spelling and styling has been maintained. Inconsistent
hyphenation has been retained. Capitalization of botanical names is
maintained as in the original. Details of the changes follow.

to papaya.

In the caption of Plate XXXVI, moved the period (".") outside the
parentheses, to match chapter heading.

In the text with Plate XXXVII, the word pesin is probably a printing
error, however it is unclear whether the intended word was resin or

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
