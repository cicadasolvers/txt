FOREWORD


During the year 1893 on the streets of Chicago were hundreds of women
who had been thrown out of employment. The genuine helplessness and
hopelessness of these women appealed strongly to the generous heart of a
wonderful woman, Dr. Sarah Hackett Stevenson, one time president of the
Chicago Woman's Club. She went before this club and stated that there
was no place in this great city where a woman without funds could find
shelter--a woman who would work if given an opportunity. She demanded in
the name of humanity that this, her club, do something at once to
relieve the situation.

Her plea had its effect, and money was subscribed for beginning work.
Other clubs responded to the call for help and contributed both
furnishings and funds. And what was called the Woman's Model Lodging
House was opened to the public.

No questions were asked of those who came for shelter--the past was not
the thing to be dealt with--only the present and future. A charge of 15
cents a night was made, and if they were without money work was given
them and they were paid for it--they, in turn, paying for their lodging.
It was the principle of the organization that the actual handling of
this money helped to preserve self-respect and that they might not feel
themselves objects of charity. This principle has held through the years
and no woman or child is turned from the door as long as there is a
place to rest.

Hon. William B. McKinley of Champaign, Ill., gave as a memorial to Dr.
Stevenson the present home at 2412 Prairie avenue, which will
accommodate sixty women and about fifty children. The organization has
become one of the strongest in the city--a delegated body of eighty-two
members who represent women's organizations of Cook County. For the last
few years the work has grown and broadened, until almost every trouble
and sorrow that can come to women and children is brought to this door.

The woman who is on the downward path of years, when it is so hard to
find employment, her little money gone, often weakened both mentally and
physically from lack of nourishment and worry--she might be any one's
mother--if not able to work for her lodging, is supplied from the loan
fund. Often she can return the small amount and she does not feel that
she has received charity, but that the hand of a friend has grasped
hers, and her faith in humanity is restored. The young girl who is alone
and without money is safe from the cheap rooming houses of the city. The
mother with her little family, who has been left, by desertion or death,
without the father's protection comes to this home and remains until she
can gather up the thread of existence once more. Often she is saved from
placing her children in institutions or giving them for adoption. An
average of 105 women and children are cared for in the Lodging House
each day.

As time brought the need of better facilities for the care of the
children, the generous friend of the Institution, Wm. B. McKinley, gave
the building at 2408 Prairie avenue for Nursery purposes. Here the
children are cared for during the day, while the mother is seeking
employment, or otherwise adjusting her affairs.

A limited number of neighborhood children are also cared for. A trained
nurse and kindergartner are employed. Twenty-four hour feedings for
bottle babies are furnished so that the little ones diet may not be
disturbed. In this department 60 children are given daily care. The
mother has charge of her family at night. Every effort is made by this
organization to keep the mother and her children together. We believe
that separation should be only after every other method has failed.

A visit to the Stevenson Memorial will interest you and you are most
welcome at all times.

HAMBURGER POT DINNER

Mrs. Antonio Sterba

With two pounds hamburger steak, mix well one cup raw rice (wash well);
one medium sized onion, chopped; season and make into balls. Line bottom
of a pot with small pieces of suet; when this is melted, place meat
balls in the pot, cover with water, and cook until rice is about done.
Add one can of tomatoes (quart can). A half hour before serving, peel
enough medium-sized potatoes to circle the platter to be used. Place
these on top of tomatoes. When potatoes are done, arrange them around
the outside rim of the platter with the meat balls in the center, and
pour over the meat enough gravy for first serving. Remainder of gravy
may be used on table in a casserole or gravy dish. Care must be used in
measuring the rice--too much will cause the balls to fall to pieces. One
advantage of this dish is that it may be prepared the day before, or the
morning before serving, with the exception of the potatoes.

to brown. Put into a saucepan two and one-half cupfuls powdered sugar
and a tablespoonful lemon juice. Place it on fire and stir with a wooden
spoon until it is melted and slightly colored. Let stand for a few
minutes, so it will be thoroughly melted, then turn in the hot almonds,
mix them together quickly, not stirring long enough to grain the sugar,
and turn it on to an oiled slab or tin. Spread it out in an even sheet
an eighth of an inch thick. While it is still warm mark off into
squares. Break into pieces when cold.


SUGARED ALMONDS

until it is dissolved, then let it cook to the boil stage without
touching except to test. Turn in half cupful of blanched almonds and
stir off the fire until the nuts are well covered with the granulated
sugar, but turn them out before they become a mass. Boil another cupful
of sugar and turn the coated almonds into it, and stir again in the same
way, giving them a second coating of sugar, but do not leave them in the
pan until they are all stuck together.

chilled, turn on marble slab or platter and cut in cubes, roll in
powdered sugar mixture and serve.

dissolved gum arabic into a saucepan with half a pound of powdered
sugar. Place the saucepan in a second pan containing boiling water; stir
until the mixture becomes thick and white. When it is beginning to
thicken test it by dropping a little into cold water; when it will form
a ball remove it from fire. Stir into it the whites of three eggs
whipped to a stiff froth. This will give a spongy texture. Lastly,
flavor it with two teaspoonfuls of orange water. Turn the paste into a
pan covered thick with cornstarch; the layer of paste should be one inch
thick. After the paste has stood for a while turn it onto a slab and cut
it into inch squares; dust them well with cornstarch or confectioner's
sugar. As the paste is more or less cooked it will be more or less
stiff.

Put a thimble over the end of rods and you can easily run it through
your curtains, or an old glove finger will answer the purpose if thimble
is too large.

To mark a hem in linen, remove thread from the machine and run the goods
through the hemmer as though stitching; you will find a perfect hem
turned down.

For removing odor of onions from hands, use celery or powdered celery
seed.

A handful of salt rubbed around sink will help remove all grease and
keep it sweet and clean.

A tiny pinch of soda will sweeten cream slightly soured.

To remove bread or cake from pans, apply wet cloth to bottom of pan.

Tack a piece of asbestos on end of ironing board for iron stand.

Burn a piece of camphor gum to rid house of mosquitoes.

To break glass evenly, tie a string around the glass, saturated with
kerosene, then fill with cold water as high as the string; set fire to
the string, and glass will snap at point of string.

If a silver spoon is placed in a jelly glass the boiling jelly can be
poured in without the least danger of breaking the glass.

To cream butter and sugar easily when butter is hard, warm the sugar
slightly.

For angel, sunshine and all sponge cakes, add the cream of tartar to the
eggs when half beaten, and if soda is called for, add it to the flour.

Lime water and linseed oil is an excellent application for burns.

To caramelize sugar: Put in a smooth granite saucepan or omelet pan,
place over hot part of stove and stir constantly until melted and of the
color of maple syrup. Care must be taken to prevent sugar from adhering
to sides of pan or spoon.

To renovate food chopper and sharpen its knives, grind a piece of sand
soap through it.

Before using new tinware, if you will rub it well with lard and heat it
thoroughly in oven, it will not rust.

To remove paint from window pains, rub with baking soda.

To remove match scratches from painted woodwork, rub with slice of
lemon, then with whiting, and wash with soap and water.

In making pancakes, two tablespoons of snow stirred in quickly is equal
to one egg.

Two apples placed in your cake box will keep the cake moist.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
