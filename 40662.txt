Many people have helped materially with the story of Salona. Peter
Maffitt, descendant of the Rev. William Maffitt, and Douglass and
Henry Mackall, descendants of one of Maffitt's sisters, generously
shared information on the Maffitt family and gave William Maffitt a
three-dimensional shape. John D. K. Smoot, Jane Smoot Wilson and
William Smoot, descendants of Jacob Smoot, recalled many stories of
their family and of Salona. Clive and Susan DuVal, present owners of
Salona, endured hours of interviews, photographing, and measuring of
the house and outbuildings.

Valuable assistance has also been given by Mike Rierson, Fairfax
County Park Authority, and W. Brown Morton, III, National Park
Service, who contributed useful information on the architectural
features and possible age of Salona; and William Elkjer measured and
drew up floor plans of Salona. The Rev. William Sengel of the Old
Presbyterian Meeting House, Jean Elliot, Frank Gapp, John Gott,
Winslow Hatch, Beth Mitchell, and Donie Rieger also contributed
information.

                  Introduction


At the edge of the busy commercial area of the community of McLean,
hidden from the heavy traffic on Dolley Madison Boulevard by a
natural screen of trees and shrubs, stands the substantial brick
dwelling known as Salona. Only a portion of the original 466 acres
surrounds the house; the rest of the land has been converted into
church properties, shopping centers, residential subdivisions, and
other appurtenances of development.

Originally, the land was part of a large grant of 2,630 acres taken
out by Thomas Lee in 1719 from the Northern Neck proprietor, and
later named "Langley," a name which persists in the area to the
present day.

The Reverend William Maffitt of Maryland purchased the 466-acre
parcel in 1812, and he may have been the builder of the brick house
at Salona to which President James Madison fled when the British
burned the capital in August, 1814.

After the death of Maffitt, the property went through the hands of
several northerners who were part of the influx of Yankees just prior
to the outbreak of the Civil War. The parcel was divided into several
pieces.

Jacob G. Smoot of Georgetown, D.C., purchased 208 acres, including
the house, in 1853. He and his descendants owned Salona for almost
100 years--through the Civil War when Camp Griffin troops were
temporary residents in tent villages on Salona and surrounding
property and in the extended period of rebuilding during the
agricultural era following. They witnessed and were part of the
subdivision of lands for suburban tract housing.

As a reflection of changes experienced in the Washington metropolitan
area following World War II, Clive DuVal, a veteran, came from
New York to accept employment with the federal government. He and his
wife Susan purchased Salona with  the idea of restoring it and using
it for a family residence.

[Illustration]

The DuVals entered into a period of community participation which
repeatedly involved the house as a center for meetings, tours and
entertainment. Because it was a sound, comfortable, gracious old
house with historical associations and community significance, they
decided to grant a permanent historic and scenic easement to Fairfax
County in 1971, preserving the house, its brick outbuildings and
eight acres of land surrounding them in perpetuity. A temporary
easement for 44 additional acres of the Salona property was granted
at the same time, fitting in with the county's stated purpose to
shape the character, direction and timing of community development
through the preservation of open space land.

Because of its historical associations, the house was placed on the
Virginia State Landmarks Register and on the National Register of
Historic Places in 1973.

 LANGLEY AND THE LEES


The brick house known as Salona stands solidly on a portion of the
original grant known as "Langley," a tract named by Thomas Lee for
ancestral Lee lands in Shropshire, England.

Thomas Lee was born in Westmoreland County, Virginia, in 1690, the
fifth son of Richard Lee, II, a member of the King's Council and
Naval Officer and Receiver of Customs for the Potomac. When Richard
died in 1714, young Thomas succeeded his father as Naval Officer for
the Potomac. Three years earlier, in 1711, he had been appointed
resident agent along with his uncle, Edmund Jenings, for Lady
Catherine Fairfax. She was proprietor of the Northern Neck grant of
over 5,000,000 acres of land originally made by Charles II in exile
to seven loyal followers, in 1649. She had become dissatisfied with
the management of her agents Micajah Perry and Robert Carter. While
his uncle was in England, Thomas Lee kept the books for the
proprietary and visited most of the farflung Fairfax property. After
his uncle returned to Virginia and took over the books, Lee used the
knowledge gained from his work with the Fairfax estate to acquire
grants of his own, among them, in 1719, the Langley tract of 2,862
acres on the Potomac River between Great Falls and Little Falls.
Because of the strategic location of this tract, he hoped to benefit
from the economic development of the western lands. While he never
realized this dream, he did become president of the King's Council
and, in 1749, acting governor of the Colony.[1]

After Thomas Lee's death in 1750, the Langley property went to his
eldest son, Philip Ludwell Lee, who also was a member of the King's
Council. A Royalist by preference he did not share the revolutionary
enthusiasms of his younger brothers, Richard Henry Lee, and Francis
Lightfoot Lee, signers of the Declaration of Independence. Moreover,
Philip Ludwell Lee, as administrator of his father's estate, was
responsible for paying their legacies to the younger children. These
legacies were never paid in full, an omission which further widened
the gap between him and his siblings.[2] In the tradition of his
father who had envisioned development of the upper Potomac, Philip
Ludwell Lee established the Town of Philee on 100 acres at the Little
Falls of the Potomac. Although he actually built warehouses there,
the town was doomed to failure.[3]

Philip Ludwell Lee died in 1775, and the Langley tract was divided
between his two daughters: Matilda, who married Henry (Light Horse
Harry) Lee, and Flora, who married Ludwell Lee of Belmont in Loudoun
County. Matilda inherited the portion on which Salona was built. If
any buildings existed on the tract at that time, it seems probable
that Matilda, as the elder daughter, would have been given the
section on which they were located.[4]

By an ironic twist of fate, in 1782, Matilda Lee, daughter of
die-hard Royalist Philip Ludwell Lee, married Henry Lee, a dashing
young officer in the American forces, whose brilliant military
exploits at Brandywine, Monmouth, and Paulus Hook (now Jersey City)
won him the esteem of General George Washington, the soubriquet of
"Light Horse Harry," and, in 1780, promotion to the rank of
lieutenant-colonel.

"Harry" Lee was the son of Henry Lee of Leesylvania, in Prince
William County, and Lucy Grymes Lee. His father was a member of the
House of Burgesses for many years and when the war with England
began, was in charge of recruiting and equipping troops for
Washington's army. After serving as a delegate to the Continental
Congress of 1785-88 and the Virginia Constitutional Convention of
1788, he was elected to the Virginia Legislature where he served
until 1791. His wife, Matilda, died in 1790, leaving him a son,
Henry. Matilda left the Langley tract to her son, with a life
interest to her husband.[5]

To assuage his grief, Harry Lee plunged deeper into politics and in
1791 was elected Governor of Virginia. Two years later he married
again, this time to Anne Hill Carter of Shirley. One of their sons was
Robert E. Lee, later commander-in-chief of the Armies of the
Confederacy. After a two-year term in Congress, Harry Lee's star began
to wane. His attempt to establish a town, Matildaville, at the Great
Falls of the Potomac, had failed, and his other land speculations had
gone sour. Eventually he spent two years in debtor's prison in
Westmoreland County, where he had once sat as a justice. In 1810, he
moved his family to Alexandria, and in 1812, was given a permanent
commission as a major-general in the United States Army, but his
failing health made it impossible for him to take part in the war
against England. He spent his last days in the West Indies, in a vain
attempt to recover his health. He died in 1818.[6]

[Illustration: _Thomas Lee's 1719 grant, adjoining Turberville,
showing the future 208-acre Smoot property at Salona._]

Harry's brother, Richard Bland Lee, did all he could to keep economic
ruin from devastating the former war hero, but managed only to get
himself deeper in debt. In 1808, during the period of financial
disaster, Harry Lee and his son sold the Langley tract to Richard
Bland Lee for $25,000. William Maffitt was a witness.[7]

No records or correspondence have yet appeared to indicate that any
of the Lees built a dwelling on the Langley tract. Thomas Lee had the
money, but architectural historians do not believe the house was
constructed during his lifetime. Philip Ludwell Lee could have built
on the tract, especially because of his town, Philee, on the Potomac,
but again the house does not appear to be old enough to have been
built during his lifetime.

Light Horse Harry Lee might have built the house when he was involved
with the development of Matildaville; estimated dates for the
construction range from 1790 to 1810. But after 1803 both Harry Lee
and his brother Richard Bland Lee were facing financial difficulties
and probably would not have built a large brick house on the Langley
tract at that time.

During Richard Bland Lee's ownership of Langley, the land was rented
to tenants.[8] A Lee descendant wrote in 1969 that "no Lee ever
resided at 'Langley.' During the Lee tenure, 1719-1839, the place was
always rented out."[9] So far, no listing of these tenants has been
discovered. The only person mentioned as a tenant is J. C. Scott.[10]
Scott has not been satisfactorily identified, although he may have
been John Caile Scott, grandson of Alexander Scott, owner of
Strawberry Vale.[11] He could have leased a portion of Langley and
even built a house on the property. That this was customary in those
days is shown by the terms of a lease agreement between Richard
Bland Lee and Henson Lewis, which reveals that Lewis leased 130 acres
of Lee's Cub Run tract on which he consented to pay taxes, plant and
maintain an apple orchard, and construct a brick or stone framed
dwelling at least 16 feet square and a brick or stone framed barn.
This lease clearly indicates that a tenant on the Langley tract might
have built Salona under the terms of a similar contract.[12]

[Illustration: _Advertisement for Salona_, Alexandria Gazette,
_November 18, 1811._]

A bible entry cited by Melvin Steadman in his book on Falls Church
reports that Thomas Sandford Wren "was born at Salona" on May 19,
1808, to Richard and Susannah (Adams) Wren.[13] According to
Steadman, Thomas Wren is buried in the El Nido Cemetery, but all of
the tombstones, with one exception, have been destroyed.[14] Because
the name "Salona" appears on a legal document for the first time in
1823, the reported entry seems still more curious. It is possible
that Salona may have been built or at least designed by one of the
Wren family. Susannah Adams Wren, Richard's wife, was a descendant of
the Adams family which had a mill adjacent to the Salona tract,
another tie to the area.[15]

Fairfax County tax records provide no clue to a possible date of
construction. In 1790, the Langley tract was carried on the rolls as
the property of the Ludwell Lee heirs and was so listed for more than
20 years. Only two significant changes appeared: one in 1792 when
more than 500 acres were sold, and again in 1811 after the sale of a
466-acre tract to Herbert. When William Maffitt first appeared on the
tax rolls as a landowner in 1813, the 466-acre tract was assessed at
$880 and his smaller tract at $79.[16]

William Herbert, who took over the 466 acres in payment of judgments
against Richard Bland Lee, had no apparent intention of living on the
property or of keeping it. A house must have existed on the property
when he bought it because when he advertised the property for sale in
the _Alexandria Gazette_ in November 1811, the copy mentioned "a
comfortable dwelling house, and out houses, a young thriving orchard
of the choicest fruit, a good garden paled in, and a spring of fine
water that has never been known to fail in the driest season, near
the house." There is no indication that the acreage was under
cultivation at that time.[17]

On March 10, 1812, the Reverend William Maffitt bought the 466-acre
tract from William Herbert. It was probably Maffitt who named the
estate "Salona."

 SALONA AND THE MAFFITTS


The first occupant of record of the house at Salona, William Maffitt,
is surrounded by legends. Supposedly, Maffitt built Salona in 1801.
Maffitt was from South Carolina. Maffitt went to Princeton. Maffitt
preached the funeral sermon for George Washington. Maffitt had a
boys' school at Salona. Maffitt lived at Salona with his wife
Harriotte Lee Turberville Maffitt, who deserted her three children by
her first marriage. Dolley Madison spent the night with the Maffitts
at Salona when she fled from the White House during the English
invasion of Washington.

The available documents give a different picture.

William Maffitt was born in Cecil County, Maryland, in 1769, eldest
son of Samuel and Ann Strawbridge Maffitt.[18] His father was a
justice of the peace, elder in the Presbyterian Church, owner of a
flourishing farm and a mill, and was a major under George Washington
during the American Revolution.

The Rev. Mr. John H. Johns made his contribution to the Maffitt
legends:

          The Rev. William Maffit [sic] was a son of
          Samuel Maffit, an elder of this church.
          Having been licensed October 9th, 1794, by
          New Castle Presbytery, he went, April 1st,
          1795, to Alexandria, Va., in Baltimore
          Presbytery. He had delicate health, and was
          pastor there for only a brief period, when
          he went to Salina [sic] six miles from
          Washington, and there became principal of a
          school, which he continued to teach for many
          years. He married twice, each time to a
          widow Lee, of the noted Lee family of
          Virginia. He died in 1828.[19]

Although many young men of Cecil County attended Princeton, the
University does not have Maffitt recorded as a student, and his name
does not appear in the official list of early Princeton
graduates.[20] He probably attended some theological school because
on October 9, 1794, the New Castle Presbytery appointed him to supply
various New Castle Presbytery congregations.[21] At that time, he
seems to have been teaching at the Wilmington Academy.[22]

On April 7, 1795, he was transferred to the Baltimore Presbytery,
with residence in Alexandria.[23] On April 14, 1795, he was hired by
the Alexandria Academy to teach Latin and English to 35 students for
the sum of 200 pounds a year.[24]

In 1798, George Washington wrote regarding the education of Martha
Washington's grandson, George Washington Parke Custis:

          If he (Custis) was to go to Alexandria, his
          Studies must be conducted at the Academy or
          in his own chamber. The first, after coming
          from a large and celebrated College, he
          would consider as degrading, and in the
          other case (being left alone) he would
          attend very little to them while Mr. Moffet
          was discharging the trust reposed in him at
          the Academy.[25]

An Alexandria historian, Mary Powell, wrote that: "The school was
attended by the best classes of Alexandria boys and able instruction
was given in the classics, history, and elocution." She also
observed: "The Rev. McWhirr and the Rev. Mr. Moffat were both
Presbyterian clergymen who taught during the lifetime of General
Washington. Mr. Leary succeeded Mr. Moffat ..."[26]

In 1801 the _Alexandria Gazette_ reported that the trustees of the
Alexandria Academy:

          express their satisfaction at the progress
          of every branch taught in the academy ...
          reading and spelling; the accurate and
          extensive knowledge of English grammar and
          of the Latin classics, reflect the highest
          honor on the capacity and diligence of Mr.
          Maffitt, the teacher.[27]

Maffitt remained at the Academy until 1804 when he notified the board
of trustees that he intended to "relinquish his situation as
principal" on June 8. No hint of his future plans was given.[28]

At least as early as 1799, Maffitt became a member of Masonic Lodge
22[29] and took part in other community activities befitting a
schoolmaster and minister. On December 24, 1799, the _Alexandria
Gazette_ reported:

          Friday next being St. John's Day, Brother
          Maffitt, at the request of Lodges 22 and 47,
          will deliver a Charity Sermon at the
          Presbyterian Meeting house at which all the
          brethren are requested to attend. N.B. it is
          expected that every brother will appear with
          his badge of mourning--and those of Lodge 22
          in full mourning.[30]

Alexandria, Virginia._]

George Washington, a member of Lodge 22, had died on December 14,
1799, and the call was to a memorial service. Maffitt did not, as
legend claims, preach the funeral sermon, although he did march with
the clergy in the lodge's funeral procession from Alexandria to Mount
Vernon to attend the ceremony.[31]

Earlier in 1799, the minutes of the General Assembly of the
Presbyterian Church show that Rev. William Maffitt was assigned to
Bladensburg.[32] There is no record of his actual presence there and
he was not re-assigned.[33] For the rest of his life, his listings in
the minutes show him "without charge." Although Maffitt was a
licensed minister, there is some doubt that he was ever ordained.[34]

On January 14, 1800, the subscribers to the establishment of a
Washington Society met at Gadsby's Tavern and William Maffitt was
named to the committee to form the constitution and by-laws.[35] On
January 28, Maffitt was appointed chaplain of the society,[36] a post
which he held at least through 1803. On February 23, 1800, the
society was called to meet at Gadsby's at 10 a.m. "to move in
procession to the Presbyterian Meeting House where an oration will be
delivered by the Rev. Mr. Maffitt, commemorative of the distinguished
merits of the Illustrious Washington."[37] Again, on February 22,
1803, the Washington Society called on Maffitt to deliver a memorial
sermon on the first president "at the Presbyterian Church at 12
o'clock. There will be instrumental and vocal music and the day will
be announced by a discharge of 16 rounds from the Market Square."[38]

On February 18, 1801, the Rev. Mr. Maffitt was elected a director of
the Alexandria Library Co., and was re-elected to this post in 1802,
1803, and 1804.[39]

On May 5, 1803, the Rev. Dr. Muir, pastor of the Presbyterian Meeting
House, married the Rev. William Maffitt to Mrs. Harriotte
Turberville.[40] Harriotte (or Henrietta) was the daughter of Richard
Henry Lee, a brother of Philip Ludwell Lee, and his second wife, Anne
Gaskins Pinckard, widow of Thomas Pinckard. Harriotte was born
December 10, 1773 at Chantilly, the Richard Henry Lee estate in
Westmoreland County.[41] Her siblings included a younger sister Sarah
who married another cousin, Edmund Jennings Lee, and the youngest
son, Francis Lightfoot Lee.[42] Her first marriage in December, 1794,
was to Richard Lee Turberville, a cousin and neighbor, who died in
1799,[43] leaving his widow with their three children: Cornelia,
Richard, and George. Richard and Harriotte Turberville had settled at
Chantilly in Fairfax County and Richard apparently died there.[44]

When Harriotte and William Maffitt were married, he was still
principal of the Alexandria Academy, living in Alexandria, and active
in community affairs. But between June 8, 1804, the date of Maffitt's
resignation from the Academy, and early 1805, he moved to Chantilly
with his wife, their first child, and the three children of
Harriotte's first marriage. It is probable that the move took place
in 1804, soon after his resignation.

Legal guardian of the three Turberville children was Thomas Lee,
Harriotte's oldest brother.[45] After his death in 1805, William
Maffitt was named guardian.[46] In this capacity he had to keep
accurate accounts of his expenditures on behalf of the children and
of income received on their property, all of which were matters of
court record. These records indicate that Maffitt was living at
Chantilly at that time.

William and Harriotte had two daughters, both christened in the
Presbyterian Meeting House: Ann Lee, born March 23, 1804, and
christened on April 20, and Harriotte, born March 16, 1805, and
christened on April 17, 1805.[47] Harriotte died right after the
birth of the second daughter, probably on April 11 or 12, 1805,
because on April 12, Maffitt began paying rent to the three
Turberville heirs for the use of their property. This was recorded
for the first time in his accounts for 1805.[48]

That he had a school on the Chantilly estate seems highly probable,
because starting in 1805, he charged the two Turberville boys for
board and tuition, but not for transportation.[49] In 1805, Maffitt
was listed for the first time on the Fairfax County personal property
tax rolls.[50] In 1810, the county census listed him as having under
his roof two males under 10, five males between 10 and 16, one male
between 26 and 45, five females under 10, and one female between 26
and 45.[51]

The guardian accounts give some interesting insights into day-by-day
activities. Buying new shoes and mending old ones for the two boys
were constant expenses. Regular sums of money were sent to Mrs. Lee,
Harriotte's sister Sally, to pay for Cornelia Turberville's board,
education, and small purchases. Books and supplies were bought for
the boys. A large portion of the estate was rented out, and so were
some of the slaves. The chimney and cellar were repaired; a new barn
was built.[52]

The accounts also show that Cornelia Turberville was married to
Charles C. Stuart in 1817, rather than 1814, as some sources report.
Up to the time of the marriage, Maffitt referred to Cornelia as "C.
Turberville"; afterwards he formally termed her "Mistress Stuart." He
also listed money given George Turberville to buy articles to attend
his sister's wedding.[53] Historians credit Cornelia and her husband
with building a house named "Chantilly" in honor of the estate of her
grandfather, Richard Henry Lee, in Westmoreland County.[54] Yet the
Maffitt accounts specifically refer to "my rent of Chantilly" in
1814,[55] three years before the Turberville-Stuart marriage.
Moreover, a public sale was held "at Chantilly" in 1817,[56] with
cash paid to C. C. Stuart from its proceeds.[57]

Curiously, the accounts show that Maffitt continued to pay rent to
the Turberville heirs through 1814, the year when, for the first
time, we definitely know he was living at Salona. Does this mean that
Maffitt himself built Salona between 1812, when he purchased the
property, and 1814, or that the house already existed and was rented
to a tenant through the first part of 1814? That Maffitt was there in
August 1814 is proven by the documented fact that President Madison
stayed at Salona overnight with Mr. Maffitt.

Robert Gamble, in his volume on Sully, quotes a letter which states
that Richard Bland Lee, Jr., was under the tutelage of the Reverend
Mr. Maffitt at some time preceding 1805.[58] This again would suggest
that Maffitt had a school at Chantilly, close to Richard Bland Lee's
home at Sully. Another biographer mentions that

          Edmund Jennings (Lee) was born at
          Alexandria, then in the District of
          Columbia, on the 3rd of May, 1797.... Mr.
          Lee received his earliest educational
          training at the school of the Rev. Mr.
          Maffitt in Fairfax, a school of high repute
          at that day.[59]

Unfortunately no dates or locations are given by the letter-writer or
the biographer.

In his history of the Old Presbyterian Meeting House, William B.
McGroarty described Maffitt in a footnote as "a Presbyterian minister
who conducted a school for boys in Fairfax County near
Alexandria."[60] Neither Chantilly nor Salona was very close to
Alexandria.

A letter from A. C. Stuart to Elizabeth Collins Lee in 1805 states
that:

          Mr. Maffitt intended to leave the place
          where he now resides and purchase a small
          farm, that he, Frank (Francis Lightfoot Lee,
          Harriotte's youngest brother) intended to do
          the same, that they were to spend their time
          in the pursuit of agriculture, botany, and
          philosophy.[61]

Was this wish expressed because Chantilly was not Maffitt's property
but that of his stepchildren, because Maffitt was lonely without
Harriotte, or because he wanted to give up teaching for farming?
Somehow, from the guardianship accounts, it seems likely that Maffitt
did not farm the Turberville acres, but rented out whatever he could,
while he busied himself otherwise.

Usually the _Alexandria Gazette_ carried announcements of the
openings of new schools, but no announcement of Maffitt's school ever
seems to have appeared. Because Maffitt performed the marriage of
_Gazette_ publisher Samuel Snowden to Mary Longden on January 8,
1802,[62] such an announcement might have been expected. Neither did
the _Gazette_ report Maffitt's departure from the Alexandria area.

Probably Maffitt was still living at Chantilly when he married for
the second time between 1807 and 1811 before William Maffitt, Jr.,
was born. His second wife was Ann Beale Carter Carter
(1767-1852),[63] widow of Charles B. Carter. Ann, also known as
Nancy, was the daughter of Robert Wormely Carter of Sabine Hall in
Richmond County, and Winifred Beale.[64] William, Jr., the only child
of this marriage, was born in November, 1811, and christened in the
Presbyterian Meeting House in February 1812.[65]

In August 1812, Maffitt was appointed a trustee of an academy to be
established in Haymarket. Among those serving with him were Ludwell
Lee of Belmont, Francis Lightfoot Lee, then living at Sully, and
William Fitzhugh of Ravensworth.[66]

Meanwhile, in 1809, James Madison, Secretary of State under Thomas
Jefferson, had been elected President. On June 18, 1812, Madison
signed a declaration of war against England. The causes of the war,
sometimes called the Second War of Independence, were basically
several aspects of nationalism. Some resentment against the British
still smouldered, fanned by British contempt and condescension toward
her former colonists. Because many English sailors deserted their
ships to sail under American colors, British ships intercepted
American vessels and "impressed" their seamen. Furthermore, many
American politicians wanted to annex Canada.

Neither the war nor the President was popular with the people, who
thought the President weak and called the conflict "Mr. Madison's
War." Attempted American invasion of Canada was a fiasco and by
August 23, 1814, the British forces were so close to Washington that
the clear and present danger of an actual invasion of the American
capital seemed imminent.

John Graham, Chief Clerk in the Department of State, and two other
clerks, Stephen Pleasanton and Josiah King, packed the valuable
public records of the State Department in coarse linen bags which
Pleasanton had purchased earlier. These included the original
Declaration of Independence, articles of confederation, federal
constitution, treaties and laws and many other papers. Stephen
Pleasanton found conveyances, loaded the bags into them and took them
to a mill 3 miles beyond Georgetown, where they were concealed.
Pleasanton spent the night of August 23, 1814, at Salona with the
Rev. Mr. Maffitt. The next day, fearing that the mill might be too
accessible to the British, who were fast approaching Washington,
Pleasanton took the state papers to Leesburg for safety.[67]

Dolley Madison, the President's popular wife, could hear in the
President's House the sounds of cannon "from a skirmish at
Bladensburg." The President had gone to meet Gen. William H. Winder,
commander of the military district, and had left his wife
instructions to "take care of my self, and of the cabinet paper,
public and private."[68]

Writing to her sister, Lucy Todd, Dolley cooly reported that her
husband

          desires that I should be ready at a moment's
          warning to enter my carriage and leave the
          city.... I am accordingly ready; I have
          pressed as many cabinet papers into trunks
          to fill one carriage; our private property
          must be sacrificed, as it is impossible to
          procure wagons for its transportation.[69]

She continued the letter on Wednesday, August 24:

          Two messengers, covered with dust, come to
          bid me fly.... At this late hour, a wagon
          has been procured; I have had it filled with
          the plate and most valuable articles
          belonging to the house....

          Our kind friend, Mr. Carroll, has come to
          hasten my departure, and is in a very mad
          humor because I insist on waiting until the
          large picture of Gen. Washington is secured,
          and it requires to be unscrewed from the
          wall. The process was found too tedious for
          these perilous moments; I have ordered the
          frame to be broken, and the canvas taken out;
          it is done--and the precious portrait placed
          in the hands of two gentlemen of New York,
          for safekeeping.... When I shall again write
          to you, or where I shall be tomorrow, I
          cannot tell!![70]

Apparently Dolley spent the night of August 24 in a tent in the
American encampment at Tennallytown, and the next day crossed over
into Virginia where she spent the night of August 25 with Matilda Lee
Love at Rokeby. The roads were crowded with refugees and the exodus
was slow. As the Loves had often been guests at the President's
House, Dolley did not have to spend night with strangers. In her
reminiscences, Matilda Love wrote:

          In the following spring of 1814, it (the
          war) came more home to us, as the British
          got into our southern waters, and in August
          came up to Washington and burnt all the
          public buildings.... As I lived about ten
          miles from Washington, Mrs. Madison and a
          number of city people took refuge at my home
          the night the British took Washington....


They watched the flames of the burning capital from Rokeby that
night.[71]

Irving Brant, definitive biographer of Madison, writes of the
departure of the Madisons from the capital:

          The travels of President and Mrs. Madison
          after the battle have long been involved in
          obscurity and contradiction owing to the
          meagerness of early records (Dolley's
          letters about it were eaten by mice),
          uncertain memories and the derogatory
          stories circulated by political detractors.
          The facts bear little resemblance to the
          popular stories in which the Jones and
          Carroll families are nonexistent, Dolley
          wanders forlornly from house to house, while
          Madison, split in person rather than
          personality, simultaneously hides in a
          miserable hovel in the Virginia woods and
          flees in terror into the distant hills of
          Maryland.

          Actually, a clear record was left by
          participants and observers. The original plan
          was for Madison to join Secretary Jones and
          their families at Bellevue and proceed by way
          of the Little Falls bridge to Wiley's Tavern
          on Difficult Run near the Great Falls. From
          there the President and cabinet members would
          cross the Potomac and join the army. Time
          growing short, Madison changed the rendezvous
          to Foxall's Foundry. With that route from the
          White House clogged by the militia's flight,
          he sent Tench Ringgold to the foundry with
          word that he was crossing at Mason's Ferry
          and would meet his wife and party at Salona,
          the home of the Reverend John [sic] Maffitt,
          three miles above the Little Falls
          bridge....[72]

          Madison, Rush and Mason rode to Wren's Tavern
          at Falls Church. Monroe and Ringgold took the
          Leesburg road, stopped briefly at Rokeby, the
          home of Richard Henry Love, two miles above
          Little Falls, and went on to Wiley's Tavern.
          From Wren's Tavern the President went to the
          Minor home and from there to Salona, where he
          spent the night with the Maffitts. But Mrs.
          Madison failed to come. She and her party had
          stopped only a mile away at Rokeby, with her
          young friend Matilda Lee Love, an occasional
          overnight guest at the White House....

          The next morning, Madison went back to Wren's
          Tavern--looking for his wife, he told Colonel
          George Graham, who gave him a guard of two
          dragoons. Returning to Salona, the President
          learned that Mrs. Madison and the Jones and
          Carroll families had gone by on their way to
          Wiley's Tavern. He and Rush followed along
          the Old Dominion Road (Mason being detained
          for a time) and took refuge from the
          hurricane in a house at "The Crossroads" five
          miles from the Little Falls bridge.[73]

At midnight, the President went to the new Conn's Ferry above Great
Falls, and at daybreak he crossed the river into Montgomery County,
Maryland. Mrs. Madison stayed at Wiley's Tavern until the President
sent her word that Washington was clear of the enemy.[74]

A more romantic but apocryphal story of the Madison's flight from
Washington was written in 1914 by a columnist known as "The Rambler"
for the _Washington Star_.[75] In this version, Dolley crossed the
Potomac on "the Causeway Ferry," then passed Nelson's mill, went on
to Falls Church, and finally drove up "to Salona Hall, the home of
Parson Maffitt, and was welcomed by Mrs. Maffitt." He further
recounts that Mrs. Madison was refused shelter at two country places
before she reached Salona, though this did not seem reasonable.[76]

The oft-told story of Dolley Madison's having been refused sanctuary
on her way to Salona by several households is not borne out by all
published accounts. Apparently, the account which does have most
corroboration is that regarding the day following the night she and
her party stayed at Rokeby.

Mrs. Madison went on the next morning, August 25, to meet her husband
at a tavern near Great Falls, probably Wiley's on Difficult Run. This
had been prearranged, and on arrival she went upstairs to wait for
Mr. Madison. Shortly, the lady of the establishment called out to her
in rage, saying, "Miss Madison! If that's you, come down and go out!
Your husband has got mine out fighting, and d---- you, you shan't
stay in my house; so get out!" Other refugees joined in the outburst,
even those who had once been guests of the Madisons at the
President's mansion, and agreed she should be expelled from all
doors. Nearby, there was another tavern, and Mrs. Madison and her
party gained admittance there to wait for her husband's arrival later
that evening.[77]

After the excitement of Madison's visit was over, Salona must have
reverted to its normal calm. At last Maffitt had realized his dream
of farming; the personal property tax records and inventory of his
estate clearly define Salona as a working farm.

But his fortunes declined, if we can judge by his personal property
tax assessments. Maffitt was assessed for 18 horses and mules and 21
black slaves in 1812; in 1814, when a very detailed account was
rendered by the county, Maffitt was shown to have 19 slaves, 12
horses and mules and a coache (4-wheeled carriage) valued at $450. In
all of Fairfax County that year, only Thomas Fairfax, William
Robinson and Bushrod Washington had coaches of higher value than his
and their vehicles were evaluated at $500 each.

By the year of his death, 1828, only 13 slaves and 3 horses were
listed, and the total evaluation of his personal property was listed
at $150. The inventory of William Maffitt's estate did show that he
had 116 head of livestock on the place including horses, oxen, sheep,
hogs and cattle. He was growing turnips, corn, rye, oats, hay and
orchard grass. The long list of household furnishings included three
desks and two bookcases of high evaluation, indicating there were
books in them. (See appendix for full inventory.) The fortunes of his
widow, Ann Carter Maffitt, declined further, until by 1835, she was
dropped off the county's personal property tax rolls.[78]

For many years, William Maffitt had continued to serve as guardian to
his first wife's Turberville children. Although Cornelia Turberville
continued to live with her aunt in Alexandria until her marriage in
1817, her two brothers seem to have lived at Salona. In June 1815,
Richard Turberville drowned in the Potomac while visiting his cousin
Matilda Lee Love at nearby Rokeby.[79] Maffitt's accounts for June
23, 1815, report the expenditure of $37.50 for Richard's coffin. He
may have been buried in the graveyard on the Salona property.[80]

The other brother, George Turberville, at some time in childhood
became a deaf mute as the result of typhoid fever. Maffitt's accounts
do not reveal the date of the onset of this affliction, but they do
show that in April 1818 George entered "The Asylum" in Hartford,
Connecticut. At that time, Maffitt advanced George $100 for board and
tuition and $100 for travel.[81] George still returned to Salona for
vacations, because in July 1819, Harriotte Maffitt wrote to him:

          It is now my time to write to you my Dear
          Brother. We are glad the time is so near
          when we expect you. When you come home we
          will go to George Town to meet you. Dr. Muir
          has been here and he preached here. Aunt
          Whann and Aunt Sally Maffitt have been here.
          Uncle Whann has gone to travel. I hope you
          will be well acquainted with the History of
          the Bible and particularly the life and
          miracles of our Blessed Saviour. We have not
          heard from Chantilly for some time, I hope
          we will go up soon. Cousin Sally Lee is
          there. We expect Aunt Edmund Lee will come
          here very soon. Sister Cornelia expects Mrs.
          Mary Tollaver, your Cousin up to see her
          this summer. Do you know Mr. Harrison of
          Alexandria? He is coming here to preach for
          us in August. Do you love me? I pray to God
          to bless and preserve you. Old Mrs. Randle
          is very well we went to see her yesterday.
          When you come home you must go to see her
          with us. I saw Miss Betty Jones last
          Sabbathe. She asked me when I had heard from
          you answer my letter very soon if you
          please. Tell me how the deaf and dumb are
          and if they improve. You must love and obey
          your teachers. Papa Mama and all the girls
          send their affectionate love to you.

               I am your affectionate sister.

                       Harriotte Maffitt.[82]


          P.S.
          All the Boys send their
          respects to you.

Another letter, this one from William C. Woodbridge to the Reverend
William Maffitt from "Asylum," was dated February 21, 1820, and
referred to a fight between George Turberville and another student.
Woodbridge wrote:

          It seems he was ridiculed & resented it &
          was then challenged. He says he was wounded
          in the knee & his antagonist the same. We
          learned it from his boasting of it to our
          pupils. He now expresses entire
          disapprobation. He made the question to you
          by my request.

Woodbridge refers to George's independence and pride which must be
checked. Obviously, this letter was one of many exchanged between
Woodbridge and Maffitt regarding George's progress[83] and is
evidence that George wrote home to his stepfather as well as to his
sisters.

Although William Maffitt died before the Lewinsville Presbyterian
Church was founded, church historians claim him as a founding father,
saying that he was appointed by the Washington Presbytery to preach
and set up a mission near Langley.[84] Harriotte's letter may lend
credence to this, although there is no report of such an assignment
in the Minutes which list Maffitt only as "without charge" after
1800.[85]

One reason for this belief may have arisen because of a bequest in
the will of Elizabeth Lee Jones, the "Miss Betty Jones" of
Harriotte's letter. Daughter of Lettice Corbin Turberville and
Catesby Jones of Westmoreland County, Miss Betty lived at "Sharon" on
part of the George Turberville grant. Her will, dated April 16, 1822,
left four acres of her property "as a site for a church and
churchyard ... dedicated to the uses and purposes of divine worship
in such manner and subject to such rules as shall ... be prescribed
by the Rev'd William Maffitt" and eight other ministers: -- Carnahan,
Wells Andrews, William Hill, John Mathews, J. B. Hoge, William C.
Walton, M. Baker, and Samuel D. Hoge, all representatives of the
Presbyterian Church. William Maffitt was a witness to this will.
Apparently, this was Maffitt's primary connection with the
establishment of the Presbyterian Church at Lewinsville.[86]

 [20] Princeton University, _General Catalogue, 1767-1845_. Peter
Maffitt also investigated and reported that William had not attended
the university. Founded in 1746 as the College of New Jersey,
Princeton did not have a theological school, as such, until 1812.
Because a persistent legend links Maffitt with South Carolina, the
author checked his possible attendance at the College of Charleston,
S.C. Surviving enrollment records beginning in 1790 (the college was
founded in 1770) show no William Maffitt. Both the College of William
and Mary and the University of Delaware reported no William Maffitt
listed in any surviving records.

 [21] An unsigned note from the Presbyterian Historical Society, 425

          mention of Maffitt's name but presented no
          biographical data. The 7 April 1795 minute
          referred only to his transfer from New
          Castle to Baltimore Presbytery and that he
          would reside in Alexandria.

 [29] This is evident only through announcements in the _Alexandria
Gazette_, and not in lodge records, although Maffitt's likeness, a
Raphael Peale physiognotrace, is displayed in the Lodge 22
headquarters now located in the George Washington Masonic Memorial in
Alexandria and is reproduced in this monograph. Lodge records list
Maffitt in 1804 as chaplain, but no other records show even the dates
of his initiation or transfer affiliation. F. L. Brockett, _The Lodge
of Washington_ (Alexandria, Va.: George E. French, c. 1875) wrote
profiles of 34 members of the lodge as of 1814, but these do not
include Maffitt. However, Brockett reported that in 1799 Maffitt's
charity sermon brought in a collection of $74.52, and his sermon of
1805, $91.67. "Charity sermons were preached on St. John's Day,
December 27, and the collection was used to assist the poor."

 [31] The Reverend Thomas Davis, Rector of Christ Church, Alexandria,
preached the funeral sermon at Mount Vernon. The Reverend James Muir,
pastor of the Presbyterian Church of Alexandria, and Dr. Addison, an
Episcopal clergyman from Maryland, also attended the service. Charles

Massie, Inc., 1956), p. 298, quoting Tobias Lear.

 [32] Presbyterian Church in the United States of America, Minutes of
the General Assembly, 1798, p. 141. The preceding year, Maffitt was
listed simply as "licentiate."

 [33] Ibid., Minutes, 1800, p. 192. This year, and in succeeding
years, Maffitt is listed as "without charge." He did, however, carry
out various pastoral duties. In 1802, at the ordination of James
Inglis in the Presbyterian Meeting House, Maffitt "concluded the
services, after having exhorted the newly ordained pastor and the
people of his charge, in a short but impressive address," according
to the _Alexandria Gazette_ of April 30, 1802.

In May, 1808, Maffitt was a commissioner to the general assembly of
the Presbyterian Church at its meeting in Baltimore, along with
Reverend James Inglis. He was late in arriving and "took his seat the
4th day of the sessions." The minutes of May 23 (p. 399) report that

          The Reverend William Maffitt, of the
          Presbytery of Baltimore, appeared in the
          Assembly and stated that he had neglected to
          bring his commission. Two commissioners from
          the same Presbytery certified that Mr.
          Maffitt had been appointed by the Presbytery
          as commissioner to this Assembly. On motion:
          _Resolved_, that Mr. Maffitt be received as
          a member. And he accordingly took his seat.


 [34] Letter to the author from Ruth B. Lee, librarian of the
Historical Foundation of the Presbyterian and Reformed Church,
Montreat, N.C., dated March 29, 1977:

          As you will see the first reference to Mr.
          Maffitt is as a licentiate in Baltimore
          Presbytery. His only pastorate seems to have
          been in Bladensburg (later Hyattsville), and
          after this he is listed as being without
          charge. This means that he was not an active
          pastor in a church. He seems to have
          remained in Baltimore Presbytery, though of
          course he may have served outside the
          Presbytery at some time and still remained a
          member of that Presbytery. I question
          whether he was actually ordained by
          Newcastle Presbytery, since the ordination
          usually took place when a man was installed
          as the pastor of a church. The licentiate is
          the candidate for the ministry who is
          licensed to preach but is not yet ordained.


Minutes for 1809 (p. 238) and 1814 (p. 184) show Maffitt "without
charge." Minutes for 1824 list him in the Presbytery of the District
of Columbia as "near Georgetown, D.C." again without charge. The
present offices of the Presbytery of the District of Columbia have
his death date as his only record in their files.

 [63] Unsigned, undated note (1977) from Sabine Hall to the author

 [64] Robert Carter Randolph, _The Carter Tree_ (Richmond, Va.: By the
author, 1951), omits any mention of offspring of Ann's first marriage
but does list William Maffitt, II, as the only child of her second
marriage. However, the American Genealogical Research Institute,
History of the Carter Family_ (Washington, D.C.: 1972) states that
four children were born to Charles and Nancy Carter: John Hill who
never married; Susan, who married the Rev. Thomas Balch, pastor of
the New York Avenue Presbyterian Church; Mary Walker, who married
Commodore Thomas ap Catesby Jones; and Elizabeth, who married Alfred
Carter. Apparently the Carter children, the young Turberville boys,
and the Maffitts all lived together as one family after the
Maffitt-Carter marriage.

Charles B. Carter was a cousin of Ann's, who owned "Richmond Hill" in
Richmond County and "Mount Atlas" in Prince William. His grave is at
Mount Atlas and the tombstone bears the dates 1766-1807.


 [65] Young William grew up at Salona, received his M.D. from
Columbian College, (later part of George Washington University),
served in the Army Medical Corps, went to St. Louis, Missouri, in
1841, married Julie Chouteau, descendant of a founder of St. Louis,
in 1843, and died there in 1864. It is interesting to note that of
the seven members of his college class, he is the only one for whom
the college does not have a full record.

Stuart and completed by an artist named Winstanley. A footnote on p.
184 quoted from Laura Carter Holloway Langford, _Ladies of the White
House_ states:

          Half a century later, when the White House
          was undergoing a renovation, this portrait
          was sent, with many others subsequently
          added to this solitary collection, to be
          cleaned and the frame burnished. The artist
          found on examination that the canvas had
          never been cut, since the rusted tacks,
          time-worn frame, and the size compared with
          the original picture, was the most
          conclusive evidence that Mrs. Madison did
          not cut it out with a carving knife, as many
          traditions have industrially circulated.

Matilda Lee Love was the daughter of Ludwell Lee of Belmont in
Loudoun County, granddaughter of Richard Henry Lee, and niece of
Harriotte Lee Turberville Maffitt. Her mother was Flora, sister of
Matilda Lee.

According to Mrs. Love's memoirs in the _Lee Chronicle_:

          Mr. Madison was a relation of my stepmother,
          Mrs. Lee, and was always very civil to us,
          and we dined and stayed at the President's
          several times. My father never would go
          there, as he opposed the Madisons to the day
          of his death ... I inherited from my mother,
          who was very wealthy, a farm near the little
          Falls of the Potomac, where we were to
          reside, and which I named Rokeby, after
          Scott's poem of that name, as Matilda was
          the heiress of Rokeby.

 [71] Arnett, _Mrs. James Madison_, pp. 243-46; Lee, _Chronicle_, p.
291.

 [72] Irving Brant, _James Madison: Commander in Chief, 1812-1836_,
pp. 306-8. Brant's error regarding Maffitt's first name has been
picked up by Walter Lord, _Dawn's Early Light_, p. 171: "James
Madison ... and the rest of the presidential party rode to Salona,
the home of the Reverend John Maffitt where Madison now expected to
meet his wife," and by Alan Lloyd, _The Scorching of Washington_, p.
170: "Madison crossed the Potomac by ferry-boat, trekking into the
adjacent hills toward the emergency rendezvous he had fixed with
Carroll: Salona, the home of an ecclesiastical friend named John
Maffitt."

When Alexandria historian Jean Elliot called Brant's attention to his
error in Maffitt's first name, Brant replied to her on July 12, 1973:

          My research cards are all in the Library of
          Congress, so I have no way of knowing
          whether I was misled by some earlier writing
          or went wrong on my own, but the matter of
          accuracy can be settled by the law of
          probability. There is no chance whatever
          that two preachers named John and William
          Maffitt co-existed in the same little
          community, at precisely the same time, with
          abundant evidence of William's existence and
          none of John's, in the records you cite.


 [73] Old Dominion Road (Drive) did not exist until the old trolley
tracks were removed in the 20th century. In a letter to Mrs.
Elizabeth Payne, Chairman of the Committee for the Marie Butler Leven
Preserve, Brant wrote on March 9, 1972: "I am not certain about the
road from Falls Church to Salona, whether it branched off from Kirby
Road at the site of the Nelson-Patterson Mill."

four acres. Instead the property reverted to the estate of her
mother, Lettice Turberville Jones, and was sold at auction with the
rest of Lettice Jones' estate to pay off the creditors of Troilus
Lewin Turberville, her brother. The present Lewinsville Presbyterian
Church stands on acreage given by the heirs of Dr. Mottrom Ball, who
had married Martha Turberville, sister of Troilus and Lettice.

 SALONA FOR SALE


After William Maffitt's death, his widow must have found life
difficult. She had to keep up the farm, care for the slaves, and
support her children and stepchildren. There was an outstanding debt
on Salona owed to her sister-in-law in Georgetown. William Maffitt
had mortgaged the property with Margaret Whann for $6,000 in 1823,
and had paid back almost half of the amount due prior to his
death.[87]

Ann Maffitt's state of mind was clearly revealed in a letter written
by her on July 22, 1828, to Col. George W. Hunter urging him to
reconsider his refusal to become administrator of her husband's
estate. She pleaded with him: "... I shall send my dear fatherless
(and I might almost add) friendless Son to you this morning who will
say everything he can to beg you not to desert us in our great time
of need...."[88]

[Illustration: _Dr. William Maffitt, Jr., Major, U. S. Army. Born
November 14, 1811, in Virginia. Died October 7, 1864, St. Louis,
Missouri. He was Reverend William Maffitt's only son._]

Apparently her appeal fell on deaf ears, for the court records show
that Robert C. Jackson was administrator. Margaret Whann brought a
chancery suit against the heirs of Maffitt in 1831 and bought Salona
at auction through her agent, Joseph McVean, for $2,650, only partial
repayment of the $3,716.54 still due her. Meanwhile, slaves and
personal property were sold, and small debts repaid. George W.
Hunter, the lawyer who had refused to serve as administrator, came to
a sale on May 20, 1829. John Hill Carter (Ann's son by her first
marriage), E. L. Carter (probably her youngest daughter, Elizabeth),
Thomas B. Balch (husband of her daughter Susan), Commodore Thomas ap
Catesby Jones (a close neighbor), and George L. Turberville
(Harriotte's son by her first marriage) all bought some of the slaves
and personal property. When the property evaluation was made, the
estate was worth $1,822.87-1/2. The inventory of Maffitt's personal
property, exclusive of his slaves, was $1,588.89-1/2. No total was
given for the value of the slaves. The court-appointed appraisers
were Nicholas Paine, William Swink, and Joseph Sewell. Although they
prepared their inventory in 1828, it was not reviewed and accepted by
the court until March, 1832.[89]

Margaret Maffitt had been born in Cecil County, Maryland, on April 7,
1780. According to Sarah Somervell Mackall, Margaret went to
Georgetown to visit her eldest sister Jane, wife of William Whann.
While there, Margaret met William's brother, David Whann, and they
were married on November 16, 1807. Until 1804, David had been a
purser in the U. S. Navy on the _Essex_. Later he became a paymaster
and traveled widely abroad. A captain in the D.C. Militia, he died of
sunstroke in May, 1813, while reviewing his men on the parade ground.
His widow "never received any compensation from the government" and
was left with two small children, a son and a daughter.[90]

Apparently Margaret permitted Ann Maffitt to remain at Salona until
1835 at least and possibly until 1842 when the property was sold to
Chapman Lee. In any case, Ann Maffitt and the three Maffitt children
did not sign a quitclaim to the property until 1835.[91] Margaret
Whann probably hired a tenant to maintain Salona as a working farm.
There are no indications that Mrs. Whann ever lived at Salona; the
deed to Lee refers to her as being "of Georgetown in the District of
Columbia."

Chapman Lee, who was living in Alexandria at the time of the sale,
bought the property in 1842.[92] He held the property for three
years, then divided it and sold 208 acres to Elisha Sherman "late of
Fairfield County, Connecticut."[93] The balance was conveyed to James
McVean and Samuel M. Whann. Eight years later, Elisha Sherman and
Anna, his wife, late of Fairfax County and "now of Washington County,
D.C.," sold to Jacob G. Smoot of Georgetown the tract "heretofore
called Langley but now called Salona"--208 acres.[94]

 SALONA AND THE SMOOTS


William Smute, originally of Dutch ancestry, came to Virginia from
Scotland in 1633 and received a grant for 400 acres of land in 1642.
He removed to Maryland in 1646 and thereafter, the Smoot (Smout)
family activities as reported in local records showed periodic
involvement with public affairs of county, colony and nation.[95]

In a recent history of St. Mary's County, Maryland, William Barton
Smoot was listed as captain of the Lower Battalion of the county's
militia during the American Revolution[96] and a William Smoot was
recorded as a recruit for service in the War of 1812 by James Jarboe
of Great Mills.[97] Mentions were made throughout the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries of Smoot activities having to do with railroads,
roads and schools.[98] The Smoot family also appears in the public
records of Charles County, Maryland. Some family members migrated to
Kentucky, others to Washington, D.C.[99]

Although Jacob Gilliam Smoot of Georgetown, D.C., purchased 208 acres
of property--Salona--in 1853, he also held property on High Street
(now Wisconsin Avenue) in Georgetown from which he probably obtained
income. His family spent winters in Georgetown. Smoot had attended
Charlotte Hall Academy in Maryland and his son William was a
graduate, in law, from Georgetown.[100] The Salona property was of a
size and assessed valuation consistently greater than over half of
the properties assessed in Fairfax County at the time. Smoot's
personal property including several slaves, was also well above
average in quantity and evaluation.[101]

Sometime following Smoot's purchase of Salona, he bought two prize
hunting dogs for a total of $5,000. The dogs later died from rabies.
Smoot was interested in establishing a good herd of cattle so he
purchased expensive registered Aberdeen Angus cattle prior to the
Civil War. During the war, the cattle were appropriated and eaten by
Union troops.[102] There were 50 cattle listed in the tax assessment
in 1857, but the herd had dropped to 12 by 1860. In that year, Smoot
was also assessed for 20 sheep and hogs. Gold, plate, silver,
jewelry, kitchen and house furnishings were evaluated at $500, far
above the average that year in Fairfax County.[103] The Smoots were a
relatively well-to-do family.

[Illustration: _The McDowell map of northeastern Virginia, 1862,

the Smoot's "Salona" property._]

From October, 1861, to April, 1862, according to a strong Smoot
family tradition, Salona was used as the headquarters of the Army of
the Potomac. Camp Griffin, in fact, was an installation partly on
Salona and partly on adjoining farms and was part of the outer
defenses of Washington. General George McClellan's dispatches,
however, never used either Salona or Smoot's Hill as a source,
although he did use datelines of Fairfax Court House and Camp
Griffin. Military historians generally agree that McClellan was
living in Washington, D.C., at the time, and, therefore, as
commanding general, his residence would have been considered the
headquarters.[104]

It is certain that troops were camped there and that there was
skirmishing in the immediate vicinity of Salona. The following
incident was recorded by E. M. Woodward, adjutant in the Second
Pennsylvania Reserves:

          Early on the morning of the 9th (October
          1861) General Smith advanced his division
          from the neighborhood of Chain Bridge to
          Langley where deploying his skirmishers, he
          pushed forward a brigade on the Dranesville
          Pike, and took possession of Prospect Hill.
          With his main body he diverged from the pike
          at Langley to the left, advancing toward
          Lewinsville, which village he entered and
          occupied without opposition, leaving the
          main portion of his troops at Smoot's Hill
          and pushing on a detachment to occupy
          Miner's Hill....

          During the first ten days, the "long roll"
          was beaten and the men got under arms five
          times. On the night of the 11th the pickets
          in the neighborhood of Lewinsville were
          driven in and the next day the enemy
          consisting of at least three regiments of
          infantry, some cavalry and a battery of six
          guns were discovered near Miner's Hill,
          concealed in the woods, which led to the
          supposition that an attack was meditated the
          next morning. At noon the drums beat and the
          men got into fighting order. General
          McClellan and staff including the Comte de
          Paris and the Duc de Chartres rode over and
          remained during the night at Smoot's House,
          and at midnight the drums beat again and
          every preparation was made for an attack.

          It was a clear and beautiful night, the moon
          shone forth in its mild beauty, the stars
          twinkled with resplendant glory and not a
          cloud glided through the sky. The drums beat
          the long roll, the trumpets of cavalry and
          artillery sounded their shrill blasts and the
          bands of the infantry pealed forth their most
          soul-stirring strains. The camp-fires burned
          brightly, the glittering bayonets and sabres
          flashed in the light and every heart beat
          high with hope.... But alas, after remaining
          in position until daybreak, chilled with
          falling dews, the boys were doomed to
          disappointment. Beauregard had only been in a
          reconnaissance in force, to ascertain our
          position since the recent extension of our
          front.[105]

When the federal troops moved out of the encampment in March, 1862,
Captain W. A. Hawley and Lt. Col. W. B. Hazmand of the 102^d New York
Volunteer Battalion signed the following memorandum giving all army
materials left behind to Jacob Smoot:[106]

[Illustration: _Original memorandum in the possession of Clive and
Susan DuVal, Salona._]

The Smoots spent most of the war in Georgetown, returning at the end
in time to save some furniture and the main part of the house from
being burned. Both wings of the house, the garden and many fine trees
had been destroyed in their absence. They had filed petitions during
the war asking the federal government for compensation for their
losses. When federal troops had occupied Salona, Smoot had taken
eight slaves to Georgetown where his brother John was in the drygoods
business. During the investigation of his reparations claim it was
discovered that J. G. Smoot had signed the Ordinance of Secession in
the Lewinsville Precinct in Fairfax County on May 23, 1861. This act
disqualified him from receiving compensation.[107]

Following the war, the Smoots set about the arduous task of restoring
their farm to its former prosperity. By 1868, the aggregate value of
personal property at Salona was $1,085, and in that year, only one in
15 taxpayers in the county had a personal property tax evaluation of
over $1,000. A rosewood piano made its appearance, followed the next
year by the addition of a "pleasure carriage" and a watch.[108] In
1870, books and pictures owned by Smoot were valued at $25.00--the
vast majority of taxpayers had none assessed at all. By 1881, there
were four conveyances, 10 horses, 10 cattle, 15 sheep, books valued
at $50.00, two watches and two clocks. One of the clocks was probably
the chiming grandfather's clock made in Newburyport, Massachusetts,
which was built about 1817 and is still in the family.[109] A sewing
machine was also listed. It is interesting to note that by 1881, at
least half of the households in Fairfax County had such a
machine.[110]

Salona was a working farm with a large barn, smokehouse, ice pond,
and cabinetshop. Hogs, sheep, cattle and fowl were raised as well as
wheat and corn. The old stone house, thought by the family to have
been the oldest structure on the place, was surrounded by a peach
orchard. The Smoots grew scuppernong grapes, plums and apricots.
Italian grape vines adorned the arbor between the house and the brick
privy. Descendants say that the farm had a consistently high yield
per acre of corn and wheat, and that this information was faithfully
recorded in account books which were destroyed when the attic was
cleaned out or taken by vandals and lost.[111] But records in
gazetteers listed J. G. and William Smoot as principal farmers in the
Langley area for a period of more than 20 years.[112]

Like William Maffitt, Jacob Smoot died intestate, in 1875. He was
survived by his widow Harriet and their four children, William S.,
Helen M., Harriet E., and Catherine C. After his widow died, each of
the children received one-fourth of the estate. Even before Jacob's
death, William Smoot, Sr., had taken over management of the farm
while his unmarried sisters kept house. Each of the sisters took one
of William's sons to raise. Jennie, William's wife, according to the
Smoot descendants, acted as hostess, greeting visitors and
entertaining them. Their son John moved to Georgetown; William Jr.,
went to Waterford to be the miller there; Gilliam stayed with his
parents and gradually took over the farm operations. Life at Salona
went on as usual, with no question of selling the farm or dividing
its acreage.

William S. Smoot, Sr., died in 1900 leaving his share of Salona by
will to his widow, Jennie K. Smoot. When she in turn died intestate,
their three children, John D. K., Calder Gilliam, and William S.,
Jr., shared her portion of the estate. Jacob's three daughters never
married, so their portions descended to their three nephews,
William's sons, John, Calder Gilliam (known by the family as
Gilliam), and William, Jr.

Both John and William died intestate. John's share of Salona was
divided among his widow, Julia B., and their children, Jane Smoot
Wilson, John D. K. Smoot, Jr., and Henry B. Smoot. William's share
went to his widow, Elizabeth, and their two sons, William S., III,
and John J.[113]

[Illustration: _"Salona," from an unpublished picture taken by "The
Rambler," about 1914. See_ Sunday Star_, "The Rambler," August 2,
1914._]

In 1914, The Rambler, a Washington Star columnist, visited Salona,
talked with the Smoots, and wrote a charming word picture of the
exterior of the house:

          You draw up in front of the garden which
          surrounds the house. A white-washed fence
          four boards high, incloses the garden.
          Inside are old cedars thick through the
          trunk and solemn in foliage. There are
          clumps of rose bushes and borders of
          jonquils. Stumps of trees that have been
          wrecked by wind or lightning support
          bark-bound flower boxes. A driveway curves
          to the left and a gravel path leads straight
          to the front porch before which the box
          trees are growing. The porch is capacious
          with a balcony on top. Under the porch and
          in the middle of the house is an arched
          doorway. On the left of the garden around
          the house is an apple orchard and on the
          right is a flourishing grape arbor. This is
          Salona. It is a fine, quiet and dignified
          old place.[114]

Some years later, in 1932, for the first time in history (as far as
it is known) Salona was open to view by the general public. It was
one of the occasions in local observance of the George Washington
Bicentennial Birthday Anniversary. Mrs. John Kurtz Smoot was the
official hostess and she and her house tour guides were dressed in
floor-length period costumes.[115]

World War II brought the end of the estate as a family farm. Gilliam
was growing older and was suffering from arthritis; help was almost
impossible to find. Unable to carry on with farming, Gilliam rented
the land to the Carper family as pasture and moved from the mansion
into a smaller house nearby. A family of Negro caretakers moved into
Salona for a time. After the Carper lease expired without renewal,
the caretakers left. William S. Smoot, III, occasionally lived on the
property, sometimes in a portion of the main house, and sometimes in
the old stone house, which he dreamed of remodeling. The main house
was rented to an antique dealer who, according to a Smoot descendant,
had the house "filled with junk from top to bottom."

Since they could no longer maintain Salona as a working farm and none
of them wanted to occupy the main house on a permanent basis, the
Smoots decided to partition the property. In 1948, Calder G. Smoot,
only surviving son of William S. and Jennie K. Smoot, Sr., received
as his share some 65 acres and the house. He did not, however, occupy
Salona.[116] In the late 1940s and early 1950s, small parcels of the
Salona property were sold to the McLean Baptist Church, the Salona
Shopping Center and Trinity Methodist Church.[117]

In the early 1950s, Salona was rented to the McLean Summer Theatre as
a dormitory for the actors. Reportedly, they left the house "a
shambles." The next tenants were a Danish captain and his family who
occupied the east wing.

In 1952, Calder Gilliam Smoot died "unmarried and intestate" and his
65 acres and the house became the joint property of his four nephews:
John D. K. Smoot, Jr., Henry B. Smoot, William S. Smoot, III, and
John J. Smoot, and of his niece, Jane Wilson Smoot. Most of this
property, in three separate land transactions, became the property of
Clive and Susan DuVal.[118]

 SALONA AND THE DUVALS


Susan and Clive DuVal, II, arrived in northern Virginia in 1952,
hunting for an older house with interesting architectural features
and surrounding acreage. When they discovered Salona, it was occupied
by the Danish family who were in the east wing. They decided it was
just the house they wanted, unprepossessing though it appeared, full
of the musty odor of unoccupied houses, ill-treated by a succession
of temporary tenants and youthful vandals, and in poor repair inside
and out. Inspection of the house would have discouraged the average
home buyer but the DuVals had the desire and resources to do what was
necessary to rehabilitate the dwelling and to live in it.

The first of three tracts was purchased from the Smoot heirs in
January, 1953, and the DuVals spent about a year extensively
renovating the house and grounds before they moved in. Without
specific descriptions of the original house to use as guidelines,
they attempted to preserve as much as possible of the presumed
original dwelling while adapting it to modern living.[119]

Both of the DuVals are descendants of French Huguenots who immigrated
to New Amsterdam in the late eighteenth century. Both were born in
New York City. One of Mrs. DuVal's grandfathers was Jesse Metcalf, a
United States senator from Rhode Island, and her father was Frederic
H. Bontecow, a New York state senator. As other residents of Salona
had been before them, the DuVals were well educated, above the
average level of Fairfax County residents. Mrs. DuVal is a graduate
of Vassar, DuVal of Yale University Law School. And like some of
their predecessors, their income, cultural interests and extent of
community involvement are also well above the average for the time in
which they live.[120]

The DuVal family arrived in Fairfax County during a period when the
population growth was expanding rapidly, both from in-migration and
natural increase. With them the couple brought their three children,
Susan Lynde (Lyn), Clive, III, and David. Daniel, their fourth, was
born in 1953. Their experience was a reflection of the times--in the
1950 U. S. Census, Fairfax County's population was 98,557; in 1960,
it had increased to 248,897.[121]

[Illustration: _The DuVal family, about 1957. Left to right Daniel,
Susan Lynde, Clive II, Susan, David and Clive III. The English
setters, Christmas, Dusty and Belle, are also "members of the
family."_]

Also reflecting the Washington metropolitan area's typical experience
in the 1950s, DuVal came from elsewhere to accept employment with the
federal government, in his case, as Assistant General Counsel
(International Affairs) for the Department of Defense. He was,
typically, a World War II veteran, a former officer in the United
States Navy. From 1955 to 1959, he was general counsel for the United
States Information Agency. Since then, he has been in the private
practice of law. As did the majority of married women with children
in the decades 1950-1970, in Fairfax County, Mrs. DuVal stayed at
home with the children rather than taking a regular outside job,
except for her many volunteer projects in which she was regularly
involved in the McLean community.[122]

Salona became a place of hospitality, where social, political, arts
and educational events were held. The Woman's Club of McLean, the
McLean House Tour, the McLean Ballet Company, Children's Hospital,
the Fairfax YWCA, the McLean Boys Club, the Northern Virginia
Democratic Women's Club, Yale University students and the Historical
Society of Fairfax County, were among the many beneficiaries of the
DuVals' generosity in making Salona available for special
events.[123]

In 1965, DuVal ran for and was elected to the Virginia House of
Delegates, in which he served for three consecutive terms.[124] He
ran unsuccessfully for the United States Senate seat against Harry F.
Byrd, Jr., in the democratic primary in 1970, but was subsequently
elected to the Virginia State Senate in 1971 and 1975.[125]

Because of his deep interest in conservation and environmental
protection, DuVal received both the Virginia state award and the
National Wildlife Federation award in 1970 for being the outstanding
conservation legislator in the United States.[126] Consistent with
this demonstrated interest, the DuVals decided to take a major step
in conservation themselves. They entered into a perpetual easement
agreement in 1971 with the Board of Supervisors, Fairfax County,
Virginia, for the historic preservation of Salona, its surrounding
outbuildings and eight acres of land. In the same legal instrument, a
temporary easement for the remaining 44.3 acres was arranged for a
period of at least ten years.[127] A later amendment, in 1974,
provided for termination of the temporary easement only after January
1, 1990.[128]

In 1975, a patriotic organization, the Society of the United States
Daughters of 1812, obtained the DuVals' permission to place an
historic plaque at Salona to commemorate James Madison's visit there
in 1814. The bronze plaque was mounted in a foundation stone from
what are thought to have been old slave quarters. They once stood in
the side yard below the house. The plaque reads as follows:


               1784-1815

                SALONA


    "A place of great hospitality"

 SALONA: THE HOUSE AND OUTBUILDINGS


The date of construction and the name of the builder of the house
known as Salona are unknown.

There have been many changes to the mansion house, the outbuildings
and grounds through the years. The central house now has only one
wing instead of the earlier two. The large barn has been torn down;
only the substantial foundation bears witness to its size. A pile of
rubble marks the site of "the old stone house," thought by the Smoot
family to have been the oldest structure on the property. The
driveway entrance is off Buchanan Street instead of the Falls Road,
although evidence of the older driveway still exists. The rear
entrance road has been blocked by subdivision construction, although
its route remains visible across the south side of the property.
Perhaps the most decided changes are in the use of the land itself.
As McLean grew, the Salona farm shrank in area and its formerly
fertile acres were transformed into shopping centers, subdivisions,
streets and roads.

Architectural historians say that they cannot pin-point the exact
construction date of Salona, but believe it to have been between 1790
and 1810, a full twenty-year span. This belief is based in part on
examination of the types of nails used in the attic of the main
house, as well as the similarity of the "cross and Bible" door at the
north entrance to some of the doors at Sully, whose construction
began in 1793.[129] Many local sources claim that the house was built
in 1801 by William Maffitt,[130] but this supposition has not been
documented. The Smoot children were always told by their elders that
the house was started in 1790 and finished in 1801, and that Maffitt
was the builder. There was a residential structure on the land when
the 466 acres were advertised for sale in 1811.[131]

Originally, the house was probably a rectangular two-story, five-bay
structure with flanking wings, which may have been frame. On the
north front, the brickwork is Flemish bond; on the other three sides
and the wing it is common bond. There are two interior end chimneys.
An elaborate bracketed cornice supports the gabled roof. This cornice
and the bracketed entrance porch with paired, squared columns show
definite Victorian influence and were probably originally added after
the Civil War. The DuVals altered the design slightly when they
renovated the house in 1952.

The most unusual feature of Salona is its wide T-shaped hall which
runs the full width of the north front of the central house, with the
main stairway rising at its west end directly across one of the front
windows. The long hall originally led to the wings on either end, but
these were apparently destroyed during the Civil War and only the
east wing was rebuilt in 1866. There is a fireplace in every room,
although most of the Federal-style mantels have been recently
installed in Salona and have come from old houses in North Carolina
and New England. There are chair rails on the walls of the living
room, dining room, and the first floor hallway. Extensive remodeling
was done by the present owners.[132] The T-shaped hall ends on the
solid wall behind the stairway on the west side, and on the east
leads directly into the post-Civil War wing which contains a small
sitting room, bathroom, and the kitchen. The smaller hall, the stem
of the T, runs perpendicular to the main hall with opposing entrance
doors at each end. The spacious living and dining rooms flank the
smaller hall, with entrances from the main hall.

[Illustration]

It is a Smoot family legend that Constantino Brumidi, the Italian
immigrant who painted many of the murals in the U. S. Capitol in
Washington, D.C., was given shelter by the Smoots, probably after the
Civil War, when he was destitute. As a token of his gratitude, he
decorated the ceilings of the living room and dining room with
flowers and fruits. No trace of these paintings now exists. However,
when the DuVals purchased Salona in 1952, there were clearly remains
of paintings on the walls and ceilings. But the plaster was in such
poor condition that it had to be completely replaced.

On the second floor, an upper hall, slightly smaller than the one
below, runs across the north front. It may once have been an open "T"
before modernization and the addition of two bathrooms by the DuVals.
To the right from the head of the stairs is the master bedroom with a
brick hearth and brick and wood mantel. The next bedroom, almost as
large, also contains a brick and wood mantel. In the east wing, the
hall leads directly into a den from which a stairway goes up to an
attic bedroom and bath, both added by the DuVals. The den also serves
as a passageway to a secondary hallway from which open two smaller
bedrooms separated by another stairway leading to the first floor
close to the kitchen. The unfinished portion of the attic is used for
storage. There is a partial basement, primarily under the east wing.

No copy of the original floor plan has been found. Records of the
Virginia Mutual Assurance Society in Richmond show that no fire
insurance was ever purchased from them on Salona, hence no floor plan
drawings are on file there.[133]

Because Maffitt died intestate, his estate was inventoried and
appraised. As a result, we know that the original house contained a
dining room furnished with a "set of three dining tables" and 24
Windsor chairs, which tends to support the tradition that the
original dining room was in the west wing, possibly occupying the
entire first floor of it.[134]

According to Smoot family legend, Salona was built entirely by
slaves, who made the brick from clay on the property. These legends
also claim that the woodwork was made by William Buckland who did the
woodwork at Gunston Hall in 1758. This seems unlikely as William
Buckland died in 1774. Smoot family legends also say that the house
was built by Maffitt, with construction starting in 1790 and ending
in 1801, and that the wings were larger than the main house.

Although the DuVals found no remnants of a west wing foundation when
they were doing extensive grading, there is visual evidence in the
brick mortar that a doorway and a window existed in the west end of
the main house. Moreover, architectural historians believe that the
placement of the kitchen and summer kitchen testify to the west
wing's existence. Furthermore, the Smoots agree that their older
relatives stated that the Yankees destroyed the west wing which was
never rebuilt.

 The Outbuildings

The old stone house was an enigma which fascinated the young Smoots.
They report that the house was built around an oversized stone
chimney in its center, with four fireplaces, two back-to-back on each
floor. Downstairs was one big room, with a winding stairway at one
end leading to the second floor where there were two rooms.
Unfortunately the building was in such disrepair when the DuVals
bought the property that they later had it razed in the interests of
safety. It was located north and east of the mansion house and was
referred to by one of the Smoots as "the trappers cabin."

The old stone spring house is still standing.

A number of early outbuildings are still in use at Salona. Close to
the house on the south is the outdoor brick kitchen, used by the
Smoots as a "summer kitchen," now by the DuVals as a guest house.
Diagonally opposite the east wing is a former brick smoke house now
used for storage. Farther to the southeast is a board and batten
corncrib. Some distance farther east are the ruins of a large bank
barn, whose thick stone foundations testify to its former size and
sturdiness. At the west end of the house, some distance away, is an
old three-hole brick privy, once approached through a grape arbor.

The DuVals have built a tennis court on a lower level of land on the
east.[135]

 PRESERVATION BY EASEMENT


Because it was a "wonderfully sound, nice and comfortable, gracious
old house" with many pleasant and historical associations and
memories, the DuVals felt that Salona should be permanently
preserved.[136] In 1971, a permanent historic and scenic easement and
a temporary easement were drawn up by the DuVals, and signed on
behalf of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors by County Executive
George Kelley.[137] (See appendix for full text of the document.)

Both easements were designed to assist the county's efforts to
protect and maintain "the scenic, historic, and recreational values
of land within the County." It also fitted in with the county
government's stated purpose to shape the character, direction and
timing of community development through the preservation of open
space land. The permanent easement was also given "to protect in
perpetuity the mansion known as 'Salona.'" It provides that "The
mansion house known as 'Salona' as such structure exists at the date
of the execution of this instrument, shall not be razed, demolished,
moved or relocated until such action is approved by the Board of
County Supervisors acting upon the advice of the Architectural Review
Board ... or until such structure becomes uninhabitable or demolished
through fire, storm or similar natural calamity."

Provision is also made for the protection of trees and shrubbery and
various uses permitted under the permanent easement.

The permanent easement includes the eight acres surrounding the
mansion; the temporary easement covers the remaining 44.3 acres.

On November 20, 1974, the deed of easement was amended, providing for
the termination of the temporary easement only after January 1, 1990.
The amendment was signed by the DuVals and Jean Packard, Chairman
acting for the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors.[138]

Salona was placed on the Virginia Landmarks Register on June 19,
1973,[139] and on the National Register of Historic Places on July
24, 1973.[140]

       1971, by and between Clive L. DuVal, 2nd and
       Susan B. DuVal, his wife, parties of the first
       part, hereinafter called the grantor, and the
       County of Fairfax, Virginia, party of the second
       part, hereinafter called County;

       protecting and maintaining the scenic, historic
       and recreational value of land within the County

            WHEREAS, the County also has a desire to
       shape the character, direction and timing of
       community development through the preservation of
       "open space" land and;

            WHEREAS, the governing body of the County
       has determined that the acceptance of the
       conveyance of certain interests in land less than
       the fee will assist in accomplishing these above
       stated objectives, and;

            WHEREAS, the grantor is the owner in fee
       simple of three certain parcels of land situate
       in Fairfax County, Virginia, containing in the

            WHEREAS, the grantor desires to join in and
       participate in the maintenance of the character
       of the land described herein as open space land
       with scenic, historical and recreational value
       and to protect in perpetuity the mansion known as

            NOW, THEREFORE THIS DEED OF EASEMENT
       WITNESSETH THAT for and in consideration of the
       foregoing provisions and of the following terms

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
