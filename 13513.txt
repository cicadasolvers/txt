OUR PROGRESS AND PROSPECTS.

When we consulted our literary friends as to the form and manner in
which it would be most expedient to put forth our "NOTES AND QUERIES,"
more than one suggested to us that our paper should appear only once a
month, or at all events not more frequently than once a fortnight, on
the ground that a difficulty would be experienced in procuring materials
for more frequent publication. We felt, however, that if such a medium
of Inter-communication, as we proposed to establish was, as we believed,
really wanted, frequency of publication was indispensable. Nothing but a
weekly publication would meet what we believed to be the requirements of
literary men. We determined, therefore, to publish a Number every
Saturday; and the result has so far justified our decision, that the
object of our now addressing our readers is to apologise to the many
friends whose communications we are again unavoidably compelled to
postpone; and to explain that we are preparing to carry out such further
improvements in our arrangements as will enable us to find earlier
admission for all the communications with which we are favoured.

One other word. It has been suggested to us that in inviting Notes,
Comments, and Emendations upon the works of Macaulay, Hallam, and other
living authors, we may possibly run a risk of offending those eminent
men. We hope not. We are sure that this outght not to be the case. Had
we not recognised the merits of such works, and the influence they were
destined to exercise over men's minds, we should not have opened our
pages for the purpose of receiving, much less have invited, corrections
of the mistakes into which the most honest and the most able of literary
inquirers must sometimes fall. Only those who have meddled in historical
research can be aware of the extreme difficulty, the all but
impossibility, of ascertaining the exact or the whole truth, amidst the
numerous minute and often apparently contradictory facts which present
themselves to the notice of all inquirers. In this very number a
correspondent comments upon an inference drawn by Mr. Hallam from a
passage in Mabillon. In inserting such a communication we show the
respect we feel for Mr. Hallam, and our {50} sense of the services which
he has rendered to historical knowledge. Had we believed that if he has
fallen into a mistake in this instance, it had been not merely a
mistake, but a deliberate perversion of the truth, we should have
regarded both book and writer with indifference, not to say with
contempt. It is in the endeavour to furnish corrections of little
unavoidable slips in such good honest books--albeit imperfect as all
books must be--that we hope at once to render good service to our
national literature, and to show our sense of genius, learning, and
research which have combined to enrich it by the production of works of
such high character and last influence.

NOTES

LATIN EPIGRAM AGAINST LUTHER AND ERASMUS.

Mr. Editor,--Your correspondent "Roterodamus" (pp. 27, 28) asks, I hope,
for the author of the epigram which he quotes, with a view to a life of
his great townsman, Erasmus. Such a book, written by some competent
hand, and in an enlarged and liberal spirit, would be a noble addition
to the literature of Europe. There is no civilised country that does not
feel an interest in the labours and in the fame of Erasmus. I am able to
answer your correspondents question, but it is entirely by chance. I
read the epigram which he quotes several years ago, in a book of a kind
which one would like to see better known in this country--a
typographical or bibliographical history of Douay. It is entitled,
"_Bibliographie Douaisienne, ou Catalogue Historique et Raisonne des
Livres imprimes a Douai depuis l'annee 1563 jusqu'a nos jours, avec des
notes bibliographiques et litteraires; Par H.R. Duthilloeul. 8vo. Douai,
1842_." The 111th book noticed in the volume is entitled, "_Epigrammata
in Haereticos. Authore Andrea Frusio, Societatis Jesu. Tres-petit in 8vo.
1596_." The book is stated to contain 251 epigrams, "aimed," says M.
Duthilloeul, "at the heretics and their doctrines. The author has but
one design, which is to render odious and ridiculous, the lives,
persons, and errors of the apostles of the Reformation." He quotes three
of the epigrams, the third being the one your correspondent has given
you. It has this title, "_De Lutheri et Erasmi differentia_," and is the
209th epigram in the book.

I have never met with a copy of the work of Frusius, nor do I know any
thing of him as an author. The learned writer who pours out a store of
curious learning in the pages of _Gentleman's Magazine_ is more likely
than any body that I know to tell you something about him.

Mons. Duthilloeul quotes another epigram from the same book upon the
_Encomium Moriae_, but it is too long and too pointless for your pages.
He adds another thing which is more in your way, namely, that a former
possessor of the copy of the work then before him had expressed his
sense of the value of these "epigrammes devotes" in the following
NOTE:--

    "_Nollem carere hoe libello auro nequidem contra pensitato_."

Perhaps some one who possesses or has access to the book would give us a
complete list of the persons who are the subjects of these defamatory
epigrams. And I may add, as you invite us to put our queries, Is not
Erasmus entitled to the distinction of being regarded as the author of
the work which the largest single edition has ever been printed and
sold? Mr. Hallam mentions that, "in the single year 1527, Colinaeus
printed 24,000 copies of the _Colloquies_, all of which were sold." This
is the statement of Moreri. Bayle gives some additional information.
Quoting a letter of Erasmus as his authority, he says, that Colinaeus,
who--like the Brussels and American reprinters of our day--was printing
the book at Paris from a Basle edition, entirely without the concurrence
of Erasmus, and without any view of his participation in the profit,
circulated a report that the book was about to be prohibited by the Holy
See. The curiosity of the public was excited. Every one longed to secure
a copy. The enormous edition--for the whole 24,000 was but one
impression--was published contemporaneously with the report. It was a
cheap and elegant book, and sold as fast as it could be handed over the
booksellers counter. As poor Erasmus had no pecuniary benefit {51} from
the edition, he ought to have the credit which arises from this proof of
his extraordinary popularity. The public, no doubt, enjoyed greatly his
calm but pungent exposure of the absurd practices which were rife around
them. That his humorous satire was felt by its objects, is obvious from
this epigram, as well as from a thousand other evidences.

HALLAMS MIDDLE AGES--ALLEGED IGNORANCE OF THE CLERGY.

Sir,--When reading Hallam's _History of the Middle Ages_ a short time
ago I was startled by the following passage which occurs amongst other
evidences of the ignorance of the clergy during the period subsequent to
the dissolution of the Roman Empire.

    "Not one priest in a thousand in Spain about the age of
    Charlemagne, could address a common letter of salutation to
    another."--_Hallam's Middle Ages_, vol. iii. p. 332.

And for this statement he refers to Mabillon, _De Re Diplomatica_, p.
52.

On referring to Mabillon, I find that the passage runs as follows:--

    "Christiani posthabitis scripturis sanctis, earumque
    interpretibus, Arabum Chaldaeorumque libris evolvendis
    incumbentes, legem suam nesciebant, et linguam propriam non
    advertebant latinam, ita ut ex omni Christi collegio vix
    inveniretur unus in milleno hominum genere, qui salutatorias
    fratri posset rationabiliter dirigere litteras."

So that although Mabillon says that scarce one in a thousand could
address a _Latin_ letter to another, yet he by no means says that it was
on account of their general ignorance, but because they were addicting
themselves to other branches of learning. They were devoting all their
energies to Arabic and Chaldaean science, and in their pursuit of it
neglected other literature. A similar remark might be made of respecting
many distinguished members of the University to which I belong; yet who
would feel himself justified in inferring thence that Cambridge was sunk
in ignorance?

ADVERSARIA

    [In our Prospectus we spoke of NOTES AND QUERIES becoming
    everybody's common-place book. The following very friendly
    letter from an unknown correspondent, G.J.K., urges us to carry
    out such an arrangement.

    "Sir,--I beg leave to forward you a contribution for your 'NOTES
    AND QUERIES,' a periodical which is, I conceive, likely to do a
    vast deal of good by bringing literary men of all shades of
    opinion into closer juxtaposition than they have hitherto been.

    "I would, however, suggest that in future numbers a space might
    be allotted for the reception of those articles (short of
    course), which students and literary men in general, transfer to
    their common-place books; such as notices of scarce or curious
    books, biographical or historical curiosities, remarks on
    ancient or obsolete customs, &c. &c. &c. Literary men are
    constantly meeting with such in the course of their reading, and
    how much better would it be if, instead of transferring them to
    a MS. book to be seen only by themselves, or perhaps a friend or
    two, they would forward them to a periodical, in which they
    might be enshrined in imperishable pica; to say nothing of the
    benefits such a course of proceeding would confer on those who
    might not have had the same facilities of gaining the
    information thus made public.

    "In pursuance of this suggestion, I have forwarded the inclosed
    paper, and should be happy, from time to time, to contribute
    such gleanings from old authors, &c. as I might think worth
    preserving.

    "G.J.K."

We readily comply with G.J.K.'s suggestion, and print, as the first of
the series, his interesting communication, entitled:]

1. _Writers of Notes on Fly-leaves, &c._

The Barberini Library at Rome contains a vast number of books covered
with marginal notes by celebrated writers, such as Scaliger, Allatius,
Holstentius, David Haeschel, Barbadori, and above all, Tasso, who has
annotated with his own hand more than fifty volumes. Valery, in his
_Voyages en Italie_, states that a Latin version of Plato is not only
annotated by the hand of Tasso, but also by his father, Bernardo; a fact
which sufficiently proves how deeply the language and philosophy of the
Greek writers were studied in the family. The remarks upon the _Divina
Commedia_, which, despite the opinion of Serassi, appear to be
authentic, attest the profound study which, from his youth, Tasso had
made of the great poets, and the lively admiration he displayed for
their works. There is also in existence a copy of the Venice edition of
the _Divina Commedia_ (1477), with autograph notes by Bembo.

Christina of Sweden had quite a mania for writing in her books. In the
library of the Roman College (at Rome) there are several books annotated
by her, amongst others a {52} Quintus Curtius, in which, as it would
appear, she criticises very freely the conduct of Alexander. "_He
reasons falsely in this case_," she writes on one page; and elsewhere,
"_I should have acted diametrically opposite; I should have pardoned_;"
and again, further on, "_I should have exercised clemency_;" an
assertion, however, we may be permitted to doubt, when we consider what
sort of clemency was exercised towards Monaldeschi. Upon the fly-leaf of
a Seneca (Elzevir), she has written, "_Adversus virtutem possunt
calamitates damna et injuriae quod adversus solem nebulae possunt_." The
library of the Convent of the Holy Cross of Jerusalem at Rome, possesses
a copy of the _Bibliotheca Hispanu_, in the first volume of which the
same princess has written on the subject of a book relating to her
conversion: [1] "_Chi l'ha scritta, non lo sa; chi lo sa, non l'ha mai
scritta_."

Lemontey has published some very curious _Memoirs_, which had been
entirely written on the fly-leaves and margins of a missal by J. de
Coligny, who died in 1686.

Racine, the French tragic poet, was also a great annotator of his books;
the Bibliotheque National at Paris possesses a Euripides and
Aristophanes from his library, the margins of which are covered with
notes in Greek, Latin, and French.

The books which formerly belonged to La Monnoie are now recognizable by
the anagram of his name. _A Delio nomen_, and also by some very curious
notes on the fly-leaves and margins written in microscopic characters.

ORIGIN OF WORD "GROG."

Mr. Vaux writes as follows:--Admiral Vernon was the first to require his
men to drink their spirits mixed with water. In bad weather he was in
the habit of walking the deck in a rough _grogram_ cloak, and thence had
obtained the nickname of _Old Grog_ in the Service. This is, I believe,
the origin of the name _grog_, applied originally to _rum_ and _water_.
I find the same story repeated in a quaint little book, called Pulleyn's
_Etymological Compendium_.

    [A.S. has communicated a similar explanation; and we are obliged
    to "An old LADY who reads for Pastime" for kindly furnishing us
    with a reference to a newly published American work, _Lifts for
    the Lazy_, where the origin of "Grog" is explained in the same
    manner.

    The foregoing was already in type when we received the following
    agreeable version of the same story.]

ORIGIN OF WORD "GROG"--ANCIENT ALMS-BASINS.

Mr. Editor,--As a sailor's son I beg to answer your correspondent
LEGOUR'S query concerning the origin of the word "grog," so famous in
the lips of our gallant tars. Jack loves to give a pet nickname to his
favourite officers. The gallant Edward Vernon (a Westminster man by
birth) was not exempted from the general rule. His gallantry and ardent
devotion to his profession endeared him to the service, and some merry
wags of the crew, in an idle humour, dubbed him "Old Grogham." Whilst in
command of the West Indian station, and at the height of his popularity
on account of his reduction of Porto Bello with six men-of-war only, he
introduced the use of rum and water by the ship's company. When served
out, the new beverage proved most palatable, and speedily grew into such
favour, that it became as popular as the brave admiral himself, and in
honour of him was surnamed by acclamation "Grog."

MACKENZIE WALCOTT, M.A.

P.S.--There are two other alms-basins in St. Margaret's worthy of note,
besides those I mentioned in your last number. One has the inscription,
"Live well, die never; die well and live ever. A.D. 1644 W.G." The other
has the appropriate legend, "Hee that gives too the poore lends unto
thee LORD." A third bears the Tudor rose in the centre. In an Inventory
made about the early part of the 17th century, are mentioned "one Bason
given by Mr. Bridges, of brasse." (The donor was a butcher in the
parish.) "Item, one bason, given by Mr. Brugg, of brasse." On the second
basin are the arms and crest of the Brewers' Company. Perhaps Mr. Brugg
was a member of it. One Richard Bridges was a churchwarden, A.D.
1630-32.

DYCE VERSUS WARBURTON AND COLLIER--AND SHAKSPEARE'S MSS.

In Mr. Dyce's _Remarks on Mr. J.P. Collier's and Mr. C. Knight's
Editions of Shakspeare_, pp. 115, 116, the following note occurs:--

    "_King Henry IV., Part Second_, act iv. sc. iv.

        "As humorous as winter, and as sudden
         As _flaws_ congealed in the spring of day."

    "Alluding," says Warburton, "to the opinion of some
    philosophers, that the vapours being congealed in air by cold,
    (which is most intense towards the morning,) and being
    afterwards rarified and let loose by the warmth of the sun,
    occasion those sudden and impetuous guests of wind which are
    called flaws."--COLLIER.

    "An interpretation altogether wrong, as the epithet here applied
    to 'flaws' might alone determine; '_congealed_ gusts of wind'
    being nowhere mentioned among the phenomena of nature except in
    Baron Munchausen's _Travels_. Edwards rightly explained 'flaws,'
    in the present passage, 'small blades of ice.' I have myself
    heard the word used to signify both _thin cakes of ice_ and the
    _bursting of those cakes_."--DYCE.

Mr. Dyce may perhaps have heard the world _floe_ (plural _floes_)
applied to _floating sheet-ice_, as it is to be found so applied
extensively in Captain Parry's _Journal of his Second Voyage_; but it
remains to be shown whether such a term existed in Shakspeare's time. I
think it did not, as after diligent search I have not met with it; and,
if it did, and then had the same meaning, _floating sheet-ice_, how
would it apply to the illustration of this passage?

That the uniform meaning of _flaws_ in the poet's time was _sudden gust
of wind_, and figuratively sudden gusts of passion, or fitful and
impetuous action, is evident from the following passages:--

  "Like a red morn, that ever yet betoken'd
  Wreck to the seamen, tempest to the field,
  Sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds,
  _Gust_ and foul _flaws_ to herdsmen and to herds."
    _Venus and Adonis._

  "Like a great sea-mark standing every _flaw_."
    _Coriolanus_, act v. sc. iii.

  "--patch a wall to expel the winter's _flaw_."
    _Hamlet_, act v. sc. i.

  "Like to the glorious sun's transparent beams
  Do calm the fury of this mad-bred _flaw_."
    _3d Pt. Henry VI._, act iii. sc. i.

  "--these _flaws_ and starts (impostors to true
  fear)."
    _Macbeth_, act iv. sc. iv.

  "Falling in the _flaws_ of her own youth, hath
  blistered her report."
    _Meas. for Meas._, act ii. sc. iii.

So far for the poet's acceptation of its meaning.

Thus also Lord Surrey:--

    "And toss'd with storms, with _flaws_, with wind, with weather."

And Beaumont and Fletcher, in _The Pilgrim_:--

  "What _flaws_, and whirles of weather,
  Or rather storms, have been aloft these three days."

Shakspeare followed the popular meteorology of his time, as will appear
from the following passage from a little ephemeris then very frequently
reprinted:--

    "_De Repentinis Ventis_.

    "8. Typhon, Plinio, Vortex, aliis Turbo, et vibratus Ecnephias,
    de _nube gelida_ (ut dictum est) abruptum aliquid saepe numero
    secum voluit, ruinamque suam illo pondere aggravat: quem
    _repentinum flatum_ a nube prope terram et mare depulsum,
    definuerunt quidam, ubi in gyros rotatur, et proxima (ut
    monuimus) verrit, suaque vi sursum raptat."--MIZALDUS,
    _Ephemeridis AEris Perpetuus: seu Rustica tempestatum
    Astrologia_, 12º Lutet. 1584.

I have sometimes thought that Shakspeare may have written:--

  "As flaws cong_est_ed in the spring of day."

It is an easy thing to have printed cong_eal_ed for that word, and
_congest_ occurs in _A Lover's Complaint_. Still I think change
unnecessary.

Has the assertion made in _An Answer to Mr. Pope's Preface to
Shakspeare_, by a Strolling Player, 1729, respecting the destruction of
the poet's MSS. papers, been ever verified? If that account is
authentic, it will explain the singular dearth of all autograph remains
of one who must have written so much. As the pamphlet is not common, I
transcribe the essential passage:--

    "How much it is to be lamented that _Two large Chests_ full of
    this GREAT MAN'S _loose papers_ and _Manuscripts_ in the hands
    of an ignorant _Baker of_ WARWICK (who married one of the
    descendants from Shakspear), were carelessly scattered and
    thrown about as Garret Lumber and Litter, to {54} the particular
    knowledge of the late _Sir William Bishop_; till they were all
    consum'd in the general Fire and Destruction of that Town."

S.W.S.

Mickleham, Nov. 14. 1849.

    [We cannot insert the interesting Query which our correspondent
    has forwarded on the subject of the disappearance of
    Shakespeare's MSS. without referring to the ingenious suggestion
    upon that subject so skilfully brought forward by the Rev.
    Joseph Hunter in his _New Illustrations of the Life, Studies,
    and Writings of Shakspeare_, vol. i. p. 105.:--"That the entire
    disappearance of all manuscripts of Shakspeare, so entire that
    no writing of his remains except his name, and only one letter
    ever addressed to him, is in some way connected with the
    religious turn which his posterity took, in whose eyes there
    would be much to be lamented in what they must, I fear, have
    considered a prostitution of the noble talents which had been
    given him."]

FOOD OF THE PEOPLE.--BILLS OF FARE IN 1683--HUMBLE PIE.

The food of the people must always be regarded as an important element
in estimating the degree of civilization of a nation, and its position
in the social scale. Mr. Macaulay, in his masterly picture of the state
of England at the period of the accession of James II., has not failed
to notice this subject as illustrative of the condition of the working
classes of that day. He tells us that meat, viewed relatively with
wages, was "so dear that hundreds of thousands of families scarcely knew
the taste of it.... The great majority of the nation lived almost
entirely on rye, barley, and oats." (_Hist. Eng._ vol. i. p. 418., 4th
ed.)

It is not uninteresting to inquire (and having found, it is worth making
a note of) what sort of fare appeared on the tables of the upper and
middle classes,--who, unlike their poorer neighbours, were in a
condition to gratify their gastronomic preferences in the choice and
variety of their viands,--with the view of determining whether the
extraordinary improvement which has taken place in the food of the
labouring population has been equally marked in that of the wealthier
orders.

Pepys, who was unquestionably a lover of good living, and never tired of
recording his feastings off "brave venison pasty," or "turkey pye," has
given in his _Diary_ many curious notices of the most approved dishes of
his day. The following "Bills of fare" of the period referred to speak,
however, directly to the point; they are taken from a work entitled,
_The accomplisht Lady's Delight, in Preserving, Physick, Beautifying,
and Cookery_. London, printed for B. Harris, 1683.

    "_A Bill of fare for a Gentleman's House about Candlemas._

    "1. A Pottage with a Hen. 2. A _Chatham_-pudding. 3. A Fricacie
    of Chickens. 4. A leg of mutton with a Sallet. Garnish your

    "_Second Course._ 1. A chine of Muton. 2. A chine of Veal. 3.
    Lark-pye. 4. A couple of Pullets, one larded. Garnished with

    "_Third Course._ 1. A dish of Woodcocks. 2. A couple of Rabbits.

not discredit the genius of a Soyer or a Mrs. Glasse, {55} it seems
pretty evident that in the article of food the labouring classes have
been the greatest gainers since 1687.

Few things are more suggestive of queries--as everybody knows from
experience--than the products of culinary art. I will not, however,
further trespass on space which may be devoted to a more dignified
topic, than by submitting the following.

_Query._--Does the phrase "to eat humble pie," used to signify a forced
humiliation, owe its origin to the "umble pye" specified above?

BISHOP BARNABY.

Mr. Editor,--Legour asks, why the people in Suffolk call a lady-bird
"Bishop Barnaby?"

I give the following from the late Major Moor's _Suffolk Words_.

    "Bishop-Barney. The golden bug. See Barnabee. In Tasser's _Ten
    Unwelcome Guests in the Dairy_, he enumerates 'the Bishop that
    burneth' (pp. 142. 144.), in an ambiguous way, which his
    commentator does not render at all clear. I never heard of this
    calumniated insect being an unwelcome guest in the dairy; but
    Bishop-Barney, or Burney, and Barnabee, or Burnabee, and
    Bishop-that-burneth, seem, in the absence of explanation to be
    nearly related--in sound at any rate. Under _Barnabee_ it will
    be seen that _burning_ has some connection with the history of
    this pretty insect."

    "Barnabee," writes the Major, "the golden-bug, or lady-bird;
    also Bishop-Barney: which see. This pretty little, and very
    useful insect, is tenderly regarded by our children. One
    settling on a child is always sent away with this sad
    valediction:--

      "Gowden-bug, gowden-bug, fly away home,
      Yar house is bahnt deown and yar children all gone."

To which I add another nursery doggerel less sad:--

  "Bishop, Bishop-Barnabee,
  Tell me when your wedding be,
  If it be to-morrow day
  Take your wings and fly away."

The Major adds, "It is sure to fly off on the third repetition."

"Burnt down," continues the Major, "gives great scope to our country
euphonic twang, altogether inexpressible in type; _bahnt deeyown_ comes
as near to it as my skill in orthography will allow."

Ray, in his _South and East Country Words_, has this:--

    "Bishop, the little spotted beetle, commonly called the lady-cow
    or lady-bird. I have heard this insect in other places called
    golden-knop, and doubtless in other countries it hath other
    names. (_E. W._ p. 70) Golden-bugs the common Suffolk name."

TRADE EDITIONS--COTTLE'S LIFE OF COLERIDGE.

Sir,--In the 2nd vol. of Mr. Collier's valuable and interesting
_Extracts from the Registers of the Stationers' Company_, p. 28, is the
following entry:--

    "Thos. Dason. Licensed unto him the praise of follie; to print
    not above xv deg. of any impression, with this condition, that any
    of the Company may laie on with him, reasonablie at every
    impression, as they think good, and that he shall gyve
    reasonable knowledge before to them as often as he shall print
    it."

This is both curious and important information as being, in all
probability, the earliest recorded instance of a custom still kept up
amongst booksellers, and which now passes under the designation of a
"Trade edition;" the meaning of which being, that the copyright, instead
of being the exclusive property of one person, is divided into shares
and held by several. There are Trade editions of such voluminous authors
as Shakspeare, Gibbon, Hume, and Robertson, for instance; and Alison's
_Europe_, if published half a century back, might in all probability
have been added to the list. The difference between the ancient and the
modern usage appears to be this, that formerly when the type was set up
for an edition "any of the company may laie on, (these two last words
are still technically used by printers for supplying type with paper,)
reasonablie at every impression," &c.; in other words, may print as many
copies from the type "as they think good;" whereas now, the edition is
first printed, and then the allotment of the copies, and the actual cost
of them is made, according to the number of shares.

If this is a "Note" worth registering, it is much at your service,
whilst for a "Query," I should be very glad to be informed, when a very
able review, the date of which I neglected {56} to make at the time,
appeared in the _Times_ newspaper, of the 2nd edition of Cottle's _Life
of Coleridge_.

With many good wishes for the success of your register,

I remain, &c.

DIBDIN'S TYPOGRAPHICAL ANTIQUITIES.

Sir,--I am very glad to have elicited the information contained in your
number just published respecting the copy of Borde's work in the Chetham
Library. As I have a great respect for Mr. Ames, I must remark that he
had no share in the blunder, and whenever a new edition of his work is
undertaken, it will be well to look rather curiously into the
enlargements of Dibdin. In the mean time this information naturally
leads to another Query--or rather, to more than one--namely, "_Had_ Mr.
Bindley's copy this unique imprint? and what became of it at the sale
of his books? or is it only one of the imaginary editions which give
bibliographers so much trouble?" Perhaps some one of your correspondents
may be able to give information.

QUERIES ANSWERED, NO. 2

MADOC THE SON OF OWEN GWYNED.

The student who confines himself to a single question, may fairly expect
a prompt and precise answer. To ask for general information on a
particular subject, may be a less successful experiment. Who undertakes
extensive research except for an especial purpose? Who can so far
confide in his memory as to append his name to a list of authorities
without seeming to prove his own superficiality? I throw out these ideas
for consideration, just as they arise; but neither wish to repress the
curiosity of _querists_, nor to prescribe bounds to the communicative
disposition of _respondents_.

Did Madoc, son of Owen Gwynedd, prince of Wales, discover America?
Stimulated by the importance of the question, and accustomed to admire
the spirit of maritime enterprise, at whatever period it may have been
called into action, I have sometimes reflected on this debatable
point--but can neither affirm nor deny it.

I advise the _student_, as a preliminary step to the inquiry, to attempt
a collection of all the accessible evidence, historical and
ethnographic, and to place the materials which pertain to each class in
the order of time. The historical evidence exists, I believe
exclusively, in the works of the chroniclers and bards of Wales; and the
ethnographic evidence in the narratives of travellers in America. The
opinions of modern writers, the gifted author of _Madoc_ not excepted,
he is at liberty to consider as _hors-d'oeuere_--to be passed on, or
tasted, _a plaisir_. As an exemplification of this plan, I submit some
short extracts, with critical remarks:--

    "Madoc another of Owen Gwyneth his sonnes left the land
    [North-Wales] in contention betwixt his brethren, and prepared
    certaine ships with men and munition, and sought adventures by
    seas, sailing west, and leaving the coast of Ireland so far
    north, that he came to a land unknowen, where he saw manie
    strange things."--CARADOC OF LLANCARVAN, _continued--The
    historie of Cambria_, 1584. 4º. p. 227.

    [The history of Caradoc ends with A.D. 1156. The continuation,
    to the year 1270, is ascribed by Powel, the editor of the
    volume, to the monks of Conway and Stratflur.]

    Carmina Meredith filii Rhesi [Meredydd ab Rhys] mentionem
    facientia de Madoco filio Oweni Gwynedd, et de sua navigatione
    in terras incognitas. Vixit hic Meredith circiter annum Domini
    1477.

      Madoc wyf, mwyedic wedd,
      Iawn genau, Owen Gwynedd;
      Ni fynnum dir, fy enaid oedd,
      Na da mawr, ond y moroedd.

    _The same in English._

      Madoc I am the sonne of Owen Gwynedd
      With stature large, and comely grace adorned;
      No lands at home nor store of wealth me please,
      My minde was whole to searche the ocean seas.

    "These verses I received of my learned friend M. William
    Camden." _Richard Hakluyt_, 1589.

    [The eulogy of Meredydd ab Rhys is very indefinite, but deserves
    notice on account of its early date. He "flourished," says W.
    Owen, "between A.D. 1430 and 1460."]

    "This land must needs be some part of that countrie of which the
    Spaniardes affirme themselves to be the first finders sith
    Hannos time; ... Whereupon it is manifest, that that countrie
    was long before by Brytaines discouered, afore either Columbus
    or Americus Vespatius lead anie Spaniardes thither. Of the viage
    and returne of this Madoc there be _manie fables fained_, as the
    common people doo use in distance of place {57} and length of
    time rather to augment than to diminish: but sure it is, that
    there he was."--HUMFREY LHOYD, _Additions to the Historie of
    Cambria_, p. 228.

    [Lhoyd, who translated the history of Caradoc, and made
    considerable additions to it, died in 1568. He mentions the
    second voyage of Madoc, but cites no authority.]

    "This Madoc arriving in that westerne countrie, unto the which
    he came, in the year 1170, left most of his people there: and
    returning backe for more of his owne nation, acquaintance and
    freends, to inhabite that faire and large countrie: went thither
    againe with ten sailes, as I find noted by Gutyn Owen. I am of
    opinion that the land, wherevnto he came, was some part of
    Mexico:" etc.--David Powel, S.T.P., note in _The historie of
    Cambria_, 1584. 4 deg.. p. 229.

    [The learned Powel relies on the authority of the poet Gutyn
    Owen. "He wrote," says W. Owen, "between A.D. 1460 and
    1490"--three centuries after the event in question!]

    _Ethnographic evidence._

    "They came [anno 1536] to part of the West Indies about Cape
    Breton, shaping their course thence north-eastwards, vntill they
    camme to the Island of Penguin," etc.--The voyage of master
    Hore, in _The principall navigations_, etc. 1589. Fol.

    [Antiquaries consider the mention of _Cape Breton_ and _Penguin
    Island_ as evidence. It cannot prove much, as the particulars
    were not committed to writing till about half-a-century after
    the voyage.]

    "There is also another kinde of foule in that countrey [between
    the Gulf of Mexico and Cape Breton] ... they have white heads,
    and therefore the country men call them _penguins_ (which
    seemeth to be a Welsh nanme). And _they have also in use divers
    other Welsh words, a matter worthy the noting_."--The relation
    of David Ingram, 1568. in _The principall navigations_, etc.
    1589. Fol.

    [This narrative was compiled from answers to certain
    _queries_--perhaps twenty years after the events related.]

    "Afterwards [anno 1669] they [The Doeg Indians] carried us to
    their town, and entertained us civilly for four months; and I
    did converse with them of many things in the British tongue, and
    _did preach to them three times a week in the British tongue_,"
    etc. Rev. Morgan Jones, 1686.--_British Remains_, 1777. 8 deg..

    [The editor omits to state how he procured the manuscript. The
    paper whence the above is extracted is either decisive of the
    question at issue, or a forgery.]

The _student_ may infer, even from these imperfect hints, that I
consider the subject which he proposes to himself as one which deserves
a strict investigation--provided the collections hereafter described
have ceased to be in existence.

    "With respect to this extraordinary occurence in the history of
    Wales, I have collected a multitude of evidences, in conjunction
    with Edward Williams, the bard, to prove that Madog must have
    reached the American continent; for the descendants of him and
    his followers exist there as a nation to this day; and the
    present position of which is on the southern branches of the
    Missouri river, under the appellations of Padoucas, White
    Indians, Civilized Indians, and Welsh Indians."--_William Owen_,
    F.A.S. 1803.

MADOC--HIS EXPEDITION TO AMERICA.

Dr. Plott, in his account, and Lord Monboddo, _Origin and Progress of
Language_, refer to the _Travels of Herbert_ (17th century), lib. iii.
cap. ult., for a full history of this supposed discovery. They derived
it from Meredyth ap Rhys, Gatty Owen, and Cynfyn ap Gronow, A.D.
1478-80. See also _Atheneaum_, Aug. 19. 1848.--Professor Elton's address
at the meeting of the British Association, on this and the earlier
Icelandic discovery.

The belief in the story has been lately renewed. See _Archaeologia
Cambrens_, 4. 65., and _L'Acadie_, by Sir J.E. Alexander, 1849. I will
only observe that in Dr. Plott's account, Madoc was directed by the
_best compass_, and this in 1170! See M'Culloch's _Dictionary of
Commerce_.

QUERIES

"CLOUDS" OR SHROUDS, IN SHAKESPEARE.

I quite agree with your correspondent D.N.R., that there never has been
an editor of Shakespeare capable of doing him full justice. I will go
farther and say, that there never will be an editor capable of doing him
any thing like justice. I am the most "modern editor" of Shakespeare,
and I am the last to pretend that I am at all capable of doing him
justice: I should be ashamed of myself if I entertained a notion so
ridiculously presumptuous. What I intended was to do him all the justice
in my power, and that I accomplished, however imperfectly. It struck me
that the best mode of attempting to do him any justice was to take the
utmost pains to restore his text to the state in which he left it; and
give me leave, very humbly, to say that this is the chief recommendation
of the edition I superintended through the press, having collated every
line, syllable, and letter, with every known old copy. For this purpose
I saw, consulted and compared every quarto and every folio impression in
the British Museum, at Oxford, at Cambridge, in the libraries of the
Duke of Devonshire and Lord Ellesmere, and in several private
collections. If my edition have no other merit, I venture to assert that
it has this. It was a work of great labour, but it was a work also of
sincere love. It is my boast, and my only boast, that I have restored
the text of Shakespeare, as nearly as possible, to the integrity of the
old copies.

When your correspondent complains, therefore, that in "Hen. IV. Part 2,"
Act III. sc. 1., in the line,

  "With deafening clamours in the slippery clouds,"

the word _shrouds_ is not substituted by editors of Shakespeare for
"clouds," the answer is, that not a single old copy warrants the merely
fanciful emendation, and that it is not at all required by the sense of
the passage. In the 4to of 1600, and in the folio of 1623, the word is
"clouds;" and he must be a very bold editor (in my opinion little
capable of doing justice to any author), who would substitute his own
imaginary improvement, for what we have every reason to believe is the
genuine text. _Shrouds_ instead of "clouds" is a merely imaginary
improvement, supported by no authority, and (as, indeed, your
correspondent shows) without the merit of originality. I am for the text
of Shakespeare as he left it, and as we find it in the most authentic
representations of his mind and meaning.

MEDAL OF THE PRETENDER.

Sir,--Possibly some one of your literary correspondents, who may be
versed in the, what D'Israeli would call _Secret_ History of the
Jacobite Court, will endeavour to answer a "Query" relative to the
following rare medal:--

    _Obv._ A ship of war bearing the French flag; on the shore a
    figure in the dress of a Jesuit (supposed to represent Father
    Petre) seated astride of a _Lobster_, holding in his arms the
    young Prince of Wales, who has a little windmill on his head.
    Legend: "Allons mon Prince, nous sommes en bon chemin." In the
    exergue, "Jacc: Franc: Eduard, suppose. 20 Juin, 1688."

    _Rev._ A shield charged with a windmill, and surmounted by a
    Jesuit's bonnet; two rows of Beads or Rosaries, for an order or
    collar, within which we read "Honny soit qui _non_ y pense;" a
    _Lobster_ is suspended from the collar as a badge. Legend: "Les
    Armes et l'Ordre du pretendu Prince de Galles."

The difficulty in the above medal is _the Lobster_, though doubtless it
had an allusion to some topic or scandal of the day; whoever can
elucidate it will render good service to Medallic History, for hitherto
it has baffled all commentators and collectors of medals. The windmill
(indicative of the poplar fable that the Prince was the son of a
miller), and the Roman Catholic symbols, are well understood.

There is an engraving of this medal in Van Loon's _Histoire Metallique
des Pays Bas_. It is also imperfectly engraved in Edwards' _Medallic
History of England_, for the Jesuit is represented kneeling on the
shore, and Pinkerton, who furnished the text, calls it "a boy kneeling
on the shore." The medal is so rare that probably the artist could
obtain only a rubbed or mutilated impression to engrave from. My
description is from a {59} specimen, in my own collection, as fine as
the day it was minted.

I may add that both Van Loon and Pinkerton have engraved the legend in
the collar erroneously, "honi soit qui _bon_ y pense;" it should be
"_non_."

after "Roger of Coverley" (Cowley, near Oxford).

Can any one inform me--

I. Where any notice of that Roger is to be found?

II. What is the etymon of "Cowley" (Temple Cowley and Church Cowley)?

THE REVEREND THOMAS LEMAN.

Mr. Editor,--Amongst the later authorities on subjects of British-Roman
antiquity, the Rev. Thomas Leman is constantly referred to, and in terms
of great commendation.

Can you inform me whether that gentleman published any work or made an
avowed communication of any of his researches? His name is not found in
the Index to the _Archaeologia_.

Mr. Leman contributed largely to Mr. Hatcher's edition of _Richard of
Cirencester_; but it is one of the unsatisfactory circumstances of this
work that these contributions, and whatever may have been derived from
the late Bishop of Cloyne, are merely acknowledged in general terms, and
are not distinguished as they occur.

I believe the MS. of the work was all in Mr. Hatcher's handwriting; some
of your readers may possibly have the means of knowing in what way he
used the materials thus given, or to what extent they were adapted or
annotated by himself.

GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE.

Sir,--Will any of your readers favour me with an account of the origin,
as well as the date of introduction, of the term "_Gothic_," as applied
to the Pointed Styles of Ecclesiastical Architecture?

This Query is, of course, intimately connected with the much-disputed
question of the origin of the Pointed Style itself. But yet I imagine
that the _application_ of the term "_Gothic_" may be found to be quite
distinct, in its origin, from the first rise of the Pointed Arch. The
invention of the Pointed Arch cannot, surely, be attributed to the

KATHERINE PEGG.

Sir,--I think you may safely add Pepys's _Diary_ to the list of books in
illustration of which you are willing to receive both Queries and
Answers. There is not a passage in the _Diary_ that does not deserve to
be understood. {60}

At vol. iv. p. 435. of the new edition is the following entry:--

    "7 May, 1668. Here [at the King's Theatre] I did kiss the pretty
    woman newly come, called Pegg, that was Sir Charles Sedley's
    mistress, a mighty pretty woman, and seems (but is not) modest."

On this Lord Braybrooke has the following note:--

    "Pegg must have been Margaret Hughes, Prince Rupert's mistress,
    who had probably before that time lived with Sir Charles
    Sedley."

And then follows some account of Mrs. Hughes. But, _query_, was the
"Pegg" of the _Diary_, Peg Hughes? was she not rather as I belived her
to have been, Katherine Pegg, by whom king Charles II. had a son,
Charles Fitz-Charles, created Earl of Plymouth, 29th July, 1675, died
1680?

Katherine Pegg has escaped Lord Braybrooke. Can any of your
correspondents tell me who she was?

QUERIES IN MEDIAEVAL GEOGRAPHY.

What are the modern names of "Watewich," "Portum Pusillum," "Mare de
Saham," "Perpessa," and "Northmuth?" They are not to be found in
Ferrario's _Lexicon_ (a geographical dictionary so defective that it has
not even the Latin name for Aix-la-Chapelle), nor in Baudrand's _Lexicon
Geographicum_ (a good dictionary for the mediaeval Latin names in France,
but not so perfect as the _Index Geographicum_ attached to the volumes
of Bouquet), nor in Martiniere's _Grande Dictionnarie Geographique_, nor
in the Index to Wright's _Courthand_, a miserable and imperfect
compilation.

    [These Queries are addressed to our correspondents in a very
    flattering review of "NOTES AND QUERIES" which appeared in the
    _Morning Herald_ of the 16th of November, and we shall be very
    glad to receive such answers to all or any of them as it may be
    in the power of any of our friends to supply.]

MYLES BLOOMFYLDE AND WILLIAM BLOMEFIELD'S METRICAL WRITINGS ON ALCHYMY.

Sir,--I have had intrusted to me a MS. metrical book on Alchymy,
"written by me Myles Bloomefylde, late of Bury Saynes Edmunde in ye
Countye of Suffolke, Physytione;" but I can find no account of the
author. Worton, Ritson, and Tanner, mention a "William Blomefield, born
at Bury. Bachelor in Physic and a Monk of Bury," who wrote _inter alia_
a metrical work called _Bloomefield's Blossoms, or the Camp of
Philosophy_.

Were there two metrical writers on alchymy of the name Bloomfield, temp.
Eliz. and connected with Bury?

    [The following Note by Park, which first appeared in the Edition
    of Wharton published in 1840, iii., p. 83., coupled with the
    fact that William Blomefield is described as a Bachelor of
    Physic, would seem to show that there is but one writer, whose
    proper name is not William, but Myles: "From Ashmole's _Notes on
    Theatrum Chemicum_, 1652. p. 478., it seems doubtful whether his
    name was not Myles."]

Mr. Editor,--Can any of your correspondents inform me who was the
"streict laced" gaoler of the records, alluded to in the following
passage in the _Collection of Chancellors of England_, by Francis
Thynne, inserted in Holinshed (ed. 1808) iv. 351.

    "John, Chancellor of England in the time of king Henrie the
    second, but what he was or in what yeare of king Henrie he lived
    I doo not know, and therefore leave it to _him that both can and
    ought to give life_ to these persons whom he imprisoneth in the
    east castell of London; not doubting but in time he will doo his

surprised at the recurrence of the name "Cold Harbour;" and again, in

I believe the point has been explained before, but perhaps some of your
readers could give some information as to its origin.

Mr. Editor,--If any reader of your valuable and much-needed periodical

authentic work containing _Statistics_ of the Roman Catholic
Church--e.g. the number of its members, or reputed members, in the

THE CURSE OF SCOTLAND--WHY IS THE NINE OF DIAMONDS SO CALLED?

I shall be obliged to any of your correspondents who will inform me why
the Nine of Diamonds is called the curse of Scotland. I have heard two
causes assigned. One, that the Duke of Cumberland, on the field after
the battle of Culloden, wrote upon the back of this card a very cruel
and inhuman order for the destruction of the persons and property of the
rebels. This cannot be true, for I have in my possession a print
entitled "Britons Association against the Pope's Bulls." In it the young
Pretender or prince is represented attempting to lead across the Tweed a
herd of bulls laden with curses, excommunications, indulgences, &c. &c.
&c. On the ground before them lies the Nine of Diamonds. This print is
dated Oct. 21. 1745, some months previous to the battle of Culloden.

The other cause assigned is, that the nine lozenges with which the
saltire is charged in the armorial bearings of the Earl of Stair, are so
arranged as to resemble the nine of diamonds, which was called the curse
of Scotland, from the active part taken by that Earl in promoting the
Union, which was most unpopular in Scotland. I cannot positively deny
that the card in question owes its evil name to this cause, but I am not
aware that the Earl of Stair was so conspicuously active as to occasion
his being peculiarly selected as an object of popular aversion on that
account. He was indeed a commissioner for drawing up the articles of the
union, and he was sent ambassador to the court of Louis XIV. chiefly for
the purpose of watching the proceedings of the Jacobites; these
circumstances may have added to the odium which attached to his name
from the part which was taken by his predecessor, who was Secretary for
Scotland, and was charged with having exceeded his authority in ordering
the massacre of Glencoe.

Nov. 12. 1849

    [We would add to Mr. Hawkins's Query, another, viz.: What is the
    earliest known instance of the card in question being so
    designated? For it is clear, if such was the case before the
    Union, the second explanation is as little satisfactory as the
    first.]

NOTES OF BOOK SALES--CATALOGUES, ETC.

The collectors of British portraits--and there are doubtless many such
among our readers--will shortly have such an opportunity of enriching
their portfolios as rarely presents itself. Messrs. Sotheby and Co.
commence, on the 3rd of December, the sale of the second portion of the
important and valuable stock of prints belonging to the well-known and
eminent printsellers, Messrs. W. and G. Smith, whose shop in Lisle
Street, Leicester Square, has been for so many years the favourite
resort of all who were in search of the rare and curious in calcographic
art. Messrs. Sotheby describe the present Sale as "comprising one of the
most numerous and interesting collections of British Historical
Portraits ever offered for sale;" and the following Lots, which exhibit
specimens of the rarities it contains, justify their statement.

33 ARCHIBALD EARL OF ARGYLL, by _Loggan, first state, before the
inscription round the oval_, VERY FINE AND RARE.

56 SIR WM. ASHURST, _Lord Mayor of London, 1694, after Linton, by R.

1209 ERASMUS, _sitting with a book before him_, by F. HOGENBERG, _H.

We have also received:--

    "A Catalogue of English and Foreign Theology, including some of
    the rarest works of our early English Divines; nearly a complete
    series of the Fathers of the Church; the various Councils and
    most important Ecclesiastical Historians, Liturgical writers,
    &c." issued by Leslie, of 58. Great Queen Street, Lincoln's Inn,
    which is one which will greatly interest all readers of the
    peculiar class to whom it is more particularly addressed.

The same may be said of the excellent "Catalogue of Old and New Books
(Part CIV)," just delivered by Petheramm of 94. High Holborn: which, in
addition to theological works, exhibits many valuable productions in
historical and general literature.

Bernard Quarritch's "Catalogue of Foreign Books and Classics, selling at
16. Castle Street, Leicester Square," well deserves the attention of
philologists. It is rich, not only in works illustrative of the Oriental
languages and literature, but also in those of Germany and Scandinavia.
Indeed, it is one which should be looked into by all students of foreign
literature.

Some curious articles, more especially in early Italian and French
literature, and on the subject of Alchymy, Astrology, Magic, &c., will
be found in a "Catalogue of Interesting and Rare Books on sale, by
George Bumstead, No. 205. High Holborn."

William Nield, 46. Burlington Arcade is, we believe a new candidate for
the favours of the purchasers of old books. His first Catalogue contains
some curious Articles in the departments of Demonology and Witchcraft; a
few varieties belonging to the "Marprelate" class such as "Penri's
Exhortation;" and a fine collection of Classical Music.

Lastly, let us mention what cannot but interest many reader of "NOTES
AND QUERIES," that Mr. Lumley, of 56. Chancery Lane, having purchased
the stock of Society of Antiquaries' publications has divided the
volumes of the Archaelogia, and has just put forth a Catalogue of the
separate papers, which are for sale, and of which he says very truly,
"their value cannot be disputed," and they are "now for the first time
offered thus to the Public."

NOTICES TO CORRESPONDENTS.

_The matter is so generally understood with regard to the management of
periodical works, that it is hardly necessary for the Editor to say
that_ HE CANNOT UNDERTAKE TO RETURN MANUSCRIPTS; _but on one point he
wishes to offer a few words of explanation to his correspondents in
general, and particularly to those who do not enable him to communicate
with them except in print. They will see, on a very little reflection,
that it is plainly his interest to take all he can get, and make the
most, and the best of everything; and therefore he begs them to take for
granted that their communications are received, and appreciated, even if
the succeeding Number bears no proof of it. He is convinced that the
want of specific acknowledgment will only be felt by those who have no
idea of the labour and difficulty attendant on the hurried management of
such a work, and of the impossibility of sometimes giving an explanation
when there really is one which would quite satisfy the writer, for the
delay or non-insertion of his communication. Correspondents in such
cases have no reason, and if they understood an editor's position they
would feel that they have no right, to consider themselves undervalued;
but nothing short of personal experience in editorship would explain to
them the perplexities and evil consequences arising from an opposite
course_.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
