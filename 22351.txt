HARPER'S LIBRARY OF SELECT NOVELS.

"THE LIBRARY OF SELECT NOVELS" has become an institution, a reliable
and unfailing recreative resource essential to the comfort of countless
readers. The most available entertainment of modern times is fiction:
from the cares of busy life, from the monotonous routine of a special
vocation, in the intervals of business and in hours of depression, a
good story, with faithful descriptions of nature, with true pictures of
life, with authentic characterization, lifts the mind out of the domain
of care, refreshes the feelings, and enlists the imagination. The
Harpers' "Library of Select Novels" is rapidly approaching its four
hundredth number, and it is safe to say that no series of books exists
which combines attractiveness and economy, local pictures and beguiling
narrative, to such an extent and in so convenient a shape. In
railway-cars and steamships, in boudoirs and studios, libraries and
chimney corners, on verandas and in private sanctums, the familiar brown
covers are to be seen. These books are enjoyed by all classes; they
appear of an average merit, and with a constant succession that is
marvelous; and in subject and style offer a remarkable variety.

  THE DOMESTIC LIFE
  of
  THOMAS JEFFERSON.

  Compiled From
  FAMILY LETTERS AND REMINISCENCES

  By His Great-Granddaughter,

  SARAH N. RANDOLPH.

  _With Illustrations._


  Crown 8vo, Illuminated Cloth, Beveled Edges, $2 50.


This volume brings the life of Jefferson in a brief space within the
reach of all. While not writing of him as of the great man or statesman,
Miss Randolph has given sufficient outline of the contemporary public
events, especially of those in which Jefferson was engaged, to make the
history of his times sufficiently clear. Her object, however, she says,
has been to give a faithful picture of Jefferson as he was in private
life, and for this she was particularly well fitted. Her biography is so
artless, so frank, and so uncolored, differing so completely from the
lives of public men as generally written. * * * This extremely
interesting volume. --_Richmond Whig._

One of the most charming and entertaining of books, and its pages will
be a source of continual surprise and pleasure to those who, while
admiring the statesman, have had their admiration tempered by the belief
that he was a demagogue, a libertine, a gamester, and a scoffer at
religion. The age in which Jefferson lived was one in which political
rancors and animosities existed with no less bitterness than in our
later day, and in which, moreover, mutual abuse and malignant
recrimination were indulged in with equal fury and recklessness. Charges
were made against Jefferson, by his political opponents, that clung to
his good name and sullied it, making it almost a by-word of shame, and
its owner a man whose example was to be shunned. The prejudices and
calumnies then born have existed down to the present day; but the mists
of evil report that have hemmed his life and his memory about are now
clearing away, and this sunny book will dispel the last shadow they have
cast, and will display the maligned victim of party hate in his true
character--as a fond, an amiable, and a simple-hearted father; a firm
friend; a truly moral and God-fearing citizen, and one of those few
great men who have had the rare fortune to be likewise good men.
--_Boston Saturday Evening Gazette._

The author of this charming book has had access to the best possible
sources of information concerning the private character of
Mr. Jefferson, embracing both the written testimony of his
correspondence and the oral testimony of family tradition. From these
materials, guided by a profound reverence for the subject, the writer
has constructed a most interesting personal biography. * * * A most
agreeable addition to American literature, and will revive the memory of
a patriot who merits the respect and gratitude of his countrymen.
--_Philadelphia Age._

This handsome volume is a valuable acquisition to American history. It
brings to the public observation many most interesting incidents in the
life of the third President; and the times and men of the republic's
beginnings are here portrayed in a glowing and genial light. The author,
in referring to the death-scenes of Jefferson, reports sentiments from
his lips which contradict the current opinion that the writer of the
Declaration of Independence was an infidel. We are glad to make this
record in behalf of truth. Young people would find this book both
entertaining and instructive. Its style is fresh and compact. Its pages
are full of tender memories. The great man whose career is so charmingly
pictured belongs to us all. --_Methodist Recorder._

There is no more said of public matters in it than is absolutely
necessary to make it clear and intelligible; but we have Jefferson, the
man and the citizen, the husband, the father, the agriculturist, and the
neighbor--the man, in short, as he lived in the eyes of his relatives,
his closest friends, and his most intimate associates. He is the
Virginian gentleman at the various stages of his marvelous career, and
comes home to us as a being of flesh and blood, and so his story gives a
series of lively pictures of a manner of existence that has passed away,
or that is so passing, for they are more conservative at the South,
socially speaking, than are we at the North, though they live so much
nearer the sun than we ever can live. * * * We can commend this book to
every one who would know the main facts of Mr. Jefferson's public
career, and those of his private life. It is the best work respecting
him that has been published, and it is not so large as to repel even
indolent or careless readers. It is, too, an ornamental volume, being
not only beautifully printed and bound, but well illustrated. * * *
Every American should own the volume. --_Boston Traveller._

A charmingly compiled and written book, and it has to do with one of the
very greatest men of our national history. There is scarcely one on the
roll of our public men who was possessed of more progressive
individuality, or whose character will better repay study, than Thomas
Jefferson, and this biography is a great boon. --_N. Y. Evening Mail._

Both deeply interesting and valuable. The author has displayed great
tact and taste in the selection of her materials and its arrangement.
--_Richmond Dispatch._

A charming book. --_New Orleans Times._

It is a series of delightful home pictures, which present the hero as he
was familiarly known to his family and his best friends, in his fields,
in his library, at his table, and on the broad verandah at Monticello,
where all the sweetest flavors of his social nature were diffused. His
descendant does not conceal the fact that she is proud of her great
progenitor; but she is ingenious, and leaves his private letters mostly
to speak for themselves. It has been thought that "a king is never a
hero to his valet," and the proverb has been considered undeniable; but
this volume shows that Jefferson, if not exactly the "hero" to whom a
little obscurity is so essential, was at least warmly loved and
enthusiastically esteemed and admired by those who knew him best. The
letters in this volume are full of interest, for they are chiefly
published for the first time now. They show a conscientious gentleman,
not at all given to personal indulgences, quick in both anger and
forgiveness, the greatest American student of his time, excepting the
cold-blooded Hamilton, absolutely without formality, but particular and
exacting in the extreme--just the man who carried his wife to the White
House on the pillion of his gray mare, and showed a British embassador
the door for an offense against good-breeding. --_Chicago Evening Post._

The reader will recognize the calm and philosophic yet earnest spirit of
the thinker, with the tenderness and playful amiability of the father
and friend. The letters can not but shed a favorable light on the
character of perhaps the best-abused man of his time. --_N. Y. Evening
Post._

No attempt is made in this volume to present its subject as a public man
or as a statesman. It is simply sought to picture him as living in the
midst of his domestic circle. And this it is which will invest the book
with interest for all classes of readers, for all who, whatever their
politics, can appreciate the beauty of a pure, loving life. * * * It is
written in an easy, agreeable style, by a most loving hand, and,
perhaps, better than any other biography extant, makes the reader
acquainted with the real character of a man whose public career has
furnished material for so much book-making. --_Philadelphia Inquirer._

The perusal of this interesting volume confirms the impression that
whatever criticisms may be brought to bear upon the official career of
Mr. Jefferson, or his influence upon the politics of this country, there
was a peculiar charm in all the relations of his personal and social
life. In spite of the strength of his convictions, which he certainly
often expressed with an energy amounting to vehemence, he was a man of
rare sunniness of temperament and sweetness of disposition. He had
qualities which called forth the love of his friends no less than the
hatred of his opponents. His most familiar acquaintance cherished the
most ardent admiration of his character. His virtues in the circle of
home won the applause even of his public adversaries. --_N. Y. Tribune._

It lifts up the curtain of his private life, and by numerous letters to
his family allows us to catch a glimpse of his real nature and
character. Many interesting reminiscences have been collected by the
author and are presented to the reader. --_Boston Commercial Bulletin._

These letters show him to have been a loving husband, a tender father,
and a hospitable gentleman. --_Presbyterian._

Jefferson was not only eloquent in state papers, but he was full of
point and clearness amounting to wit in his minor correspondence.
--_Albany Argus._

It is the record of the life of one of the most extraordinary men of any
age or country. --_Richmond Inquirer._

With the public life of Thomas Jefferson the public is familiar, as
without it no adequate knowledge is possible of the history of Virginia
or of the United States. Its guiding principles and great events, as
likewise its smallest details, have long been before the world in the
"Jefferson Papers," and in the laborious history of Randall. But to a
full appreciation of the politician, the statesman, the publicist, and
the thinker, there was still wanting some complete and correct knowledge
of the man and his daily life amidst his family. This want Miss Randolph
has endeavored most successfully to supply. As scarcely one of the
founders of the republic had warmer friends, or exerted a deeper and a
wider influence upon the country, so scarcely one encountered more
bitter animosity or had to live down slander more envenomed. Truth
conquered in the end, and the foul rumors, engendered in partisan
conflicts, against the private life of Jefferson have long shrunk into
silence in the light of his fame. Nevertheless, it is well done of his
descendant thus to place before the world his life as in his letters and
his conversation it appeared from day to day to those nearest and
dearest to him. Nor is it a matter of small value to bring to our sight
the interior life of our ancestors as it is delineated in the letters of
Jefferson, touching incidently on all the subjects of dress, food,
manners, amusements, expenditures, occupations--in brief, neglecting
nothing of what the men of those days were and thought and did. It is of
such materials that consist the pictures of history whose gaunt outlines
of battles, sieges, coronations, dethronements, and parliaments are of
little worth without the living and breathing details of everyday
existence. * * * The author has happily performed her task, never
obtruding her own presence upon the reader, careful only to come forward
when necessary to explain some doubtful point or to connect the events
of different dates. She may be congratulated upon the grace with which
she has both written and forborne to write, never being beguiled by the
vanity of authorship or that too great care which is the besetting sin
of biography. --_Petersburg Daily Index._

It is a highly interesting book, not only as a portraiture of the
domestic life of Jefferson, but as a side view of the parties and
politics of the day, witnessed in our country seventy years ago. The
correspondence of the public characters at that period will be read with
special interest by those who study the early history of our government.
--_Richmond Christian Observer._

In the unrestrained confidence of family correspondence, nature has
always full sway, and the revelations presented in this book of
Mr. Jefferson's real temper and opinions, unrestrained or unmodified by
the caution called for in public documents, make the work not only
valuable but entertaining. --_N. Y. World._

The author has done her work with a loving hand, and has made a most
interesting book. --_N. Y. Commercial Advertiser._

It gives a picture of his private life, which it presents in a most
favorable light, calculated to redeem Jefferson's character from many,
if not all, the aspersions and slanders which, in common with most
public characters, he had to endure while living. --_New Bedford
Standard._

The letters of Jefferson are models of epistolary composition--easy,
graceful, and simple. --_New Bedford Mercury._

The book is a very good picture of the social life not only of himself
but of the age in which he lived. --_Detroit Post._

One of the most charming memoirs of the day. --_N. Y. Times._




THE TOM BROWN BOOKS.


    [Illustration {Arthur Hughes}]


_TOM BROWN'S SCHOOL DAYS._ [1480]

By An Old Boy. New Edition. Beautifully Illustrated by Arthur Hughes and
Sydney Prior Hall. 8vo, Paper, 50 cents.

Nothing need be said of the merits of this acknowledged on all hands to
be one of the very best boy's books ever written. "Tom Brown" does not
reach the point of ideal excellence. He is not a faultless boy; but his
boy-faults, by the way they are corrected, help him in getting on. The
more of such reading can be furnished the better. There will never be
too much of it. --_Examiner and Chronicle._

Can be read a dozen times, and each time with tears and laughter as
genuine and impulsive as at the first. --_Rochester Democrat._

Finely printed, and contains excellent illustrations. "Tom Brown" is a
book which will always be popular with boys, and it deserves to be.
--_World_ (N. Y.).

For healthy reading it is one book in a thousand. --_Advance._


_TOM BROWN AT OXFORD._

By the Author of "Tom Brown's School Days." New Edition. With
Illustrations by Sydney Prior Hall. 8vo, Paper, 75 cents.

A new and very pretty edition. The illustrations are exceedingly good,
the typography is clear, and the paper white and fine. There is no need
to say any thing of the literary merits of the work, which has become a
kind of classic, and which presents the grand old Tory University to the
reader in all its glory and fascination. --_Evening Post._

A book of which one never wearies. --_Presbyterian._

Fairly entitled to the rank and dignity of an English classic. Plot,
style, and truthfulness are of the soundest British character. Racy,
idiomatic, mirror-like, always interesting, suggesting thought on the
knottiest social and religious questions, now deeply moving by its
unconscious pathos, and anon inspiring uproarious laughter, it is a work
the world will not willingly let die. --_Christian Advocate._

TWO VALUABLE HOUSEHOLD BOOKS

Published by HARPER & BROTHERS, New York.


OUR GIRLS.

By DIO LEWIS, A.M., M.D.

NEW EDITION. 12mo, Cloth, $1 50.

The book not only deserves to be read; it _will_ be read, because it is
full of interest, concerning itself, as it does, with such matters as
girls' boots and shoes; how girls should walk; low neck and short
sleeves; outrages upon the body; stockings supporters; why are women so
small? idleness among girls; sunshine and health; a word about baths;
what you should eat; how to manage a cold; fat and thin girls, etc.,
etc. --_N. Y. Evening Post._

Dr. Dio Lewis has written a sensible and lively book. There is not a
dull page in it, and scarcely one that does not convey some sound
instruction. We wish the book could enter thousands of our homes,
fashionable and unfashionable; for we believe it contains suggestions
and teaching of precisely the kind that "our girls" every where need.
--_N. Y. Independent._

This really important book. --_Christian Union._

Written in Dr. Lewis's free and lively style, and is full of good ideas,
the fruit of long study and experience, told in a sensible, practical
way that commends them to every one who reads. The whole book is
admirably sensible. --_Boston Post._

Full of practical and very sensible advice to young women.
--_Episcopalian._

Dr. Lewis is well known as an acute observer, a man of great practical
sagacity in sanitary reform, and a lively and brilliant writer upon
medical subjects. --_N. Y. Observer._

We like it exceedingly. It says just what ought to be said, and that in
style colloquial, short, sharp, and memorable. --_Christian Advocate._

The whole tone of the book is pure and healthy. --_Albany Express._

Every page shows him to be in earnest, and thoroughly alive to the
importance of the subjects he discusses. He talks like one who has a
solemn message to deliver, and who deems the matter far more essential
than the manner. His book is, therefore, a series of short, earnest
appeals against the unnatural, foolish, and suicidal customs prevailing
in fashionable society. --_Churchman._

A timely and most desirable book. --_Springfield Union._

Full of spicy, sharp things about matters pertaining to health; full of
good advice, which, if people would but take it, would soon change the
world in some very important respects; not profound or systematic, but
still a book with numberless good things in it. --_Liberal Christian._

The author writes with vigor and point, and with occasional dry humor.
--_Worcester Spy._

Brimful of good, common-sense hints regarding dress, diet, recreation,
and other necessary things in the female economy. --_Boston Journal._

Dr. Lewis talks very plainly and sensibly, and makes very many important
suggestions. He does not mince matters at all, but puts every thing in a
straightforward and, not seldom, homely way, perspicuous to the dullest
understanding. His style is lively and readable, and the book is very
entertaining as well as instructive. --_Register_, Salem, Mass.

One of the most popular of modern writers upon health and the means of
its preservation. --_Presbyterian Banner._

There is hardly any thing that may form a part of woman's experience
that is not touched upon. --_Chicago Journal._


THE BAZAR BOOK OF DECORUM:

CARE OF THE PERSON, MANNERS, ETIQUETTE, AND CEREMONIALS.

16mo, Toned Paper, Cloth, Beveled Edges, $1 00.

A series of sensible, well-written, and pleasant essays on the care of
the person, manners, etiquette, and ceremonials. The title _Bazar Book_
is taken from the fact that some of the essays which make up this volume
appeared originally in the columns of _Harper's Bazar_. This in itself
is a sufficient recommendation--_Harper's Bazar_ being probably the only
journal of fashion in the world which has good sense and enlightened
reason for its guides. The "Bazar Book of Decorum" deserves every
commendation. --_Independent._

A very graceful and judicious compendium of the laws of etiquette,
taking its name from the _Bazar_ weekly, which has become an established
authority with the ladies of America upon all matters of taste and
refinement. --_N. Y. Evening Post._

It is, without question, the very best and most thorough work on the
subject which has ever been presented to the public. --_Brooklyn Daily
Times._

It would be a good thing if at least one copy of this book were in every
household of the United States, in order that all--especially the youth
of both sexes--might read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest its wise
instruction, pleasantly conveyed in a scholarly manner which eschews
pedantry. --_Philadelphia Press._

Abounds in sensible suggestions for keeping one's person in proper
order, and for doing fitly and to one's own satisfaction the thousand
social duties that make up so large a part of social and domestic life.
--_Correspondence of Cincinnati Chronicle._

Full of good and sound common-sense, and its suggestions will prove
valuable in many a social quandary. --_Portland Transcript._

A little work embodying a multitude of useful hints and suggestions
regarding the proper care of the person and the formation of refined
habits and manners. The subject is treated with good sense and good
taste, and is relieved from tedium by an abundance of entertaining
anecdotes and historical incident. The author is thoroughly acquainted
with the laws of hygiene, and wisely inculcates them while specifying
the rules based upon them which regulate the civilities and ceremonies
of social life. --_Evening Post_, Chicago.

* * * It would be easy to quote a hundred curt, sharp sentences, full of
truth and force, and touching points of behavior and personal habitude
that concern us all. --_Springfield Republican._

By far the best book of the kind of which we have any knowledge.
--_Chicago Journal._

An eminently sensible book. --_Liberal Christian._

SCIENCE FOR THE YOUNG.

BY JACOB ABBOTT,

Author of "The Young Christian Series," "Marco Paul Series," "Rainbow
and Lucky Series," "Little Learner Series," "Franconia Stories,"
Illustrated Histories, &c., &c.


Few men enjoy a wider or better earned popularity as a writer for the
young than Jacob Abbott. His series of histories, and stories
illustrative of moral truths, have furnished amusement and instruction
to thousands. He has the knack of piquing and gratifying curiosity.
In the book before us he shows his happy faculty of imparting useful
information through the medium of a pleasant narrative, keeping alive
the interest of the young reader, and fixing in his memory valuable
truths. --_Mercury_, New Bedford, Mass.

Jacob Abbott is almost the only writer in the English language who knows
how to combine real amusement with real instruction in such a manner
that the eager young readers are quite as much interested in the useful
knowledge he imparts as in the story which he makes so pleasant a medium
of instruction. --_Buffalo Commercial Advertiser._


HEAT:

Being Part I. of _Science for the Young_. By JACOB ABBOTT. Copiously
Illustrated. 12mo, Illuminated Cloth, black and gilt, $1 50.

Perhaps that eminent and ancient gentleman who told his young master
that there was no royal road to science could admit that he was mistaken
after examining one of the volumes of the series "Science for the
Young," which the Harpers are now bringing out. The first of these,
"Heat," by Jacob Abbott, while bringing two or three young travelers
from a New York hotel across the ocean to Liverpool in a Cunarder, makes
them acquainted with most of the leading scientific principles regarding
heat. The idea of conveying scientific instruction in this manner is
admirable, and the method in which the plan is carried out is excellent.
While the youthful reader is skillfully entrapped into perusing what
appears to be an interesting story, and which is really so, he devours
the substance and principal facts of many learned treatises. Surely this
is a royal road for our young sovereigns to travel over. --_World_,
N. Y.

It combines information with amusement, weaving in with a story or
sketch of travel dry rules of mechanics or chemistry or philosophy.
Mr. Abbott accomplishes this object very successfully. The story is a
simple one, and the characters he introduces are natural and agreeable.
Readers of the volume, young and old, will follow it with unabating
interest, and it can not fail to have the intended effect. --_Jewish
Messenger._

It is admirably done. * * * Having tried the book with children, and
found it absolutely fascinating, even to a bright boy of eight, who has
had no special preparation for it, we can speak with entire confidence
of its value. The author has been careful in his statements of facts and
of natural laws to follow the very best authorities; and on some points
of importance his account is more accurate and more useful than that
given in many works of considerable scientific pretensions written
before the true character of heat as what Tyndall calls "a mode of
motion" was fully recognized. * * * Mr. Abbott has, in his "Heat,"
thrown a peculiar charm upon his pages, which makes them at once clear
and delightful to children who can enjoy a fairy tale. --_N. Y. Evening
Post._

* * * Mr. Abbott has avoided the errors so common with writers for
popular effect, that of slurring over the difficulties of the subject
through the desire of making it intelligible and attractive to unlearned
readers. He never tampers with the truth of science, nor attempts to
dodge the solution of a knotty problem behind a cloud of plausible
illustrations. The numerous illustrations which accompany every chapter
are of unquestionable value in the comprehension of the text, and come
next to actual experiment as an aid to the reader. --_N. Y. Tribune._


LIGHT:

Being Part II. of _Science for the Young_. By JACOB ABBOTT. Copiously
Illustrated. 12mo, Illuminated Cloth, black and gilt, $1 50.

Treats of the theory of "Light," presenting in a popular form the latest
conclusions of chemical and optical science on the subject, and
elucidating its various points of interest with characteristic clearness
and force. Its simplicity of language, and the beauty and
appropriateness of its pictorial illustrations, make it a most
attractive volume for young persons, while the fullness and accuracy of
the information with which it overflows commends it to the attention of
mature readers. --_N. Y. Tribune._

Like the previous volume, it is in all respects admirable. It is a
mystery to us how Mr. Abbott can so simplify the most abstruse and
difficult principles, in which optics especially abounds, as to bring
them within the grasp of quite youthful readers; we can only be very
grateful to him for the result. This book is up to our latest knowledge
of the wonderful force of which it treats, and yet weaves all its
astounding facts into pleasing and readable narrative form. There are
few grown people, indeed, whose knowledge will not be vastly increased
by a perusal of this capital book. --_N. Y. Evening Mail._

Perhaps there is no American author to whom our young people are under
so great a debt of gratitude as to this writer. The book before us, like
all its predecessors from the same pen, is lucid, simple, amusing, and
instructive. It is well gotten up and finely illustrated, and should
have a place in the library of every family where there are children.
--_N. Y. Star._

It is the second volume of a delightful series started by Mr. Abbott
under the title or "Science for the Young," in which is detailed
interesting conversations and experiments, narratives of travel, and
adventures by the young in pursuit of knowledge. The science of optics
is here so plainly and so untechnically unfolded that many of its most
mysterious phenomena are rendered intelligible at once. --_Cleveland
Plain Dealer._

It is complete, and intensely interesting. Such a series must be of
great usefulness. It should be in every family library. The volume
before us is thorough, and succeeds in popularizing the branch of
science and natural history treated, and, we may add, there is nothing
more varied in its phenomena or important in its effects than light.
--_Chicago Evening Journal._

Any person, young or old, who wishes to inform himself in a pleasant way
about the spectroscope, magic-lantern cameras, and other optical
instruments, and about solar, electric, calcium, magnesium, and all
other kinds of light, will find this book of Mr. Abbott both interesting
and instructive. --_Lutheran Observer._

By Anthony Trollope.

Anthony Trollope's position grows more secure with every new work which
comes from his pen. He is one of the most prolific of writers, yet his
stories improve with time instead of growing weaker, and each is as
finished and as forcible as though it were the sole production of the
author. --_N. Y. Sun._

MISS MULOCK'S NOVELS.

She attempts to show how the trials, perplexities, joys, sorrows,
labors, and successes of life deepen or wither the character according
to its inward bent.

She cares to teach, _not_ how dishonesty is always plunging men into
infinitely more complicated external difficulties than it would in real
life, but how any continued insincerity gradually darkens and corrupts
the very life-springs of the mind: _not_ how all events conspire to
crush an unreal being who is to be the "example" of the story, but how
every event, adverse or fortunate, tends to strengthen and expand a high
mind, and to break the springs of a selfish or merely weak and
self-indulgent nature.

She does not limit herself to domestic conversations, and the mere shock
of character on character; she includes a large range of events--the
influence of worldly successes and failures--the risks of commercial
enterprises--the power of social position--in short, the various
elements of a wider economy than that generally admitted into a tale.

She has a true respect for her work, and never permits herself to "make
books," and yet she has evidently very great facility in making them.

There are few writers who have exhibited a more marked progress, whether
in freedom of touch or in depth of purpose, than the authoress of "The
Ogilvies" and "John Halifax."

  TENNYSON'S
  COMPLETE
  POETICAL WORKS.


    [Illustration {Alfred, Lord Tennyson}]


POETICAL WORKS OF ALFRED TENNYSON, Poet Laureate. With numerous
Illustrations and Three Characteristic Portraits. Forty-fifth Thousand.
Including many Poems not hitherto contained in his collected works. New
Edition, containing "The Window; or, The Loves of the Wrens;" with Music
by Arthur Sullivan. 8vo, Paper, 75 cents; Cloth, $1 25.

Tennyson is, without exception, the most popular of living poets.
Wherever the English language is spoken, in America as well as in
England, his name has become familiar as a household word, and some
volume of the many he has published is to be found in almost every
library. For several years a complete cheap edition of his poetical
works has been an acknowledged desideratum. Messrs. Harper & Brothers,
taking advantage of the conclusion of the Arthurian Poems, have now
supplied this want by publishing an attractive household edition of the
Laureate's poems, in one volume, clearly and handsomely printed, and
illustrated with many engravings after designs by Gustave Dore,
Rossetti, Stanfield, W. H. Hunt, and other eminent artists. The volume
contains every line the Laureate has ever published, including the
latest of his productions, which complete the noble cycle of Arthurian
legends, and raise them from a fragmentary series of exquisite cabinet
pictures into a magnificent tragic epic, of which the theme is the
gradual dethronement of Arthur from his spiritual rule over his order,
through the crime of Guinevere and Lancelot; the spread of their
infectious guilt, till it breaks up the oneness of the realm, and the
Order of the Round Table is shattered, and the ideal king, deserted by
many of his own knights, and deeply wounded in the last great battle
with the traitor and the heathen, vanishes into the darkness of the
world beyond.


The print is clear and excellent; the paper is good; the volume has
illustrations from Dore, Millais, and other great artists. Really, the
edition is a sort of prodigy in its way. --_Independent._

Those who want a perfect and complete edition of the works of the great
English Poet Laureate should purchase the Harper edition. --_Troy
Budget._

A marvel of cheapness. --_The Christian Era._

The whole get-up and style of this edition are admirable, and we are
sure it will be a welcome addition to every book-case, large or small.
But the marvelous thing about it is the price, which is only _one
dollar_ for the handsome cloth binding. --_Tribune_ (Wilmington, Del.).

A marvelous instance of blended beauty and cheapness. --_Charleston
Courier._

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
