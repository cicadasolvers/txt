PREFACE.


~The Etymological Dictionary of the Scottish Language~, which was
published in the year 1808, has been so favourably received, that
although the impression was large, a set is now rarely to be found; and
at any rate cannot be purchased at less than double the price paid by
Subscribers.

As many, who would wish to possess the original work, cannot now be
supplied; while it has still been out of the reach of others, not less
interested in our national literature; the Author has been advised to
give it to the Public in an abridged form.

He has followed the same plan with that of the abridgment of Dr
~Johnson~'s English Dictionary; in giving all the terms contained in the
larger work, in their various significations, the names of the writers
by whom they are used, or the titles of the works in which they occur,
and their derivations. In one instance only has he deviated from the
plan of the great English Lexicographer, in placing the etymons after
the definitions. This mode is undoubtedly the most simple; as a reader,
when looking into a Dictionary for the origin of a word with which he is
familiar, or for the signification of one with which he is unacquainted,
must be supposed to turn his eye first to the definition, that he may
know whether this is the word that he looks for, or whether, in the
passage in which it has occurred, it can bear the sense there given,
before he thinks of examining its origin, or can form any judgment as to
the propriety of the etymon that may be offered.

While this work contains a variety of words which are not to be found in
the quarto edition, the Author flatters himself that he does not claim
too much in supposing, that during ten years which have elapsed since it
was published, he has had it in his power, from many sources formerly
unexplored, to make considerable improvements both in the explanatory
and in the etymological department. This, he trusts, will be evident to
any who will take the trouble to compare the one work with the other.

In most instances, where he has met with new significations of the words
explained in the larger work, he has inserted them in this, with their
authorities. Such, indeed, is the copiousness of our vernacular
language, that he is far from pretending that he has had it in his
power to give a complete view of it. From the recent publication of many
of our old acts formerly imprinted, from his own researches, and from
the liberal communications both of friends and strangers, who have been
anxious to render what they are pleased to consider a national work as
complete as possible, the Author has been supplied with a great variety
of terms which were formerly unknown to him. These he hopes to have it
soon in his power to give to the public in an additional volume in
quarto, in order to complete the former work. This, as far as he can
calculate at present, will be equal in size to any of the preceding
volumes.

_Rules for rendering the use of this Dictionary more easy._


Y vowel, used by our ancient writers promiscuously with _i_, being in
fact only double _i_, and printed _ij_ in other northern languages, is
to be sought for, not as it stands in the English alphabet, but in the
same place with the letter _i_, throughout the work.

Words not found in SH, to be sought for under SCH.

Those, in like manner, not found in WH, to be sought for under QUH,
expressing the sound of the old Gothic guttural.

Words, improperly printed in our old books with _Z_, to be looked for
under Y consonant.

     easily have been imagined, without so laborious an

    AN
    ETYMOLOGICAL
    DICTIONARY
    OF THE
    SCOTTISH LANGUAGE.




A


The letter A has, in the Scottish language, four different sounds:

1. _A_ broad, as in E. _all_, _wall_. _U_ is often added, as in _cald_,
cold, written also _cauld_; and sometimes _w_; both as marks of the
prolongation of the sound.

2. _A_ short, in _lak_, _mak_, _tak_, S. as in _last_, _past_, E.

3. _A_ open, in _dad_, _daddie_, a father, and some other words, S. as
in E. _read_ pret., _ready_ adj.

4. _A_ slender or close, in _lane_, _alane_, alone, _mane_, moan, S.
like _face_, _place_, E. The monosyllables have generally, although not
always, a final _e_ quiescent.


_A_ is used in many words instead of _o_ in E.; as _ane_, _bane_,
_lang_, _sang_, _stane_, for _one_, _bone_, _long_, _song_, _stone_. For
the Scots preserve nearly the same orthography with the Anglo-Saxons,
which the English have abandoned. Thus the words last mentioned were
written in A. S. _an_, _ban_, _lang_, _sang_, _stan_. In some of the
northern counties, as in Angus and Mearns, the sound of _ee_ or _ei_
prevails, instead of _ai_, in various words of this formation. _Ane_,
_bane_, _stane_, &c. are pronounced _ein_, _bein_, _stein_, after the
manner of the Germans, who use each of these terms in the same sense.

When this letter is written with an apostrophe, as _a'_, it is meant to
intimate that the double _l_ is cut off, according to the pronunciation
of Scotland. But this is merely of modern use.


_A_ is sometimes prefixed to words, both in S. and old E., where it
makes no alteration of the sense; as _abade_, delay, which has precisely
the same meaning with _bade_. This seems to have been borrowed from the
A. S., in which language _abidan_ and _bidan_ are perfectly synonymous,
both simply signifying, to remain, to tarry.


_A_, in composition, sometimes signifies _on_; as _agrufe_, on the
_grufe_ or belly, S.; Isl. _a grufu_, cernue, prone. Johnson thinks that
_a_, in the composition of such E. words as _aside_, _afoot_, _asleep_,
is sometimes contracted from _at_. But these _terms_ are unquestionably
equivalent to _on side_, _on foot_, _on sleep_; on being used, in the
room of _a_, by ancient writers.


_A_ is used, by our oldest writers, in the sense of _one_. The
signification is more forcible than that of the indefinite article in
English; for it denotes, not merely an individual, where there may be
many, or one in particular, but one exclusively of others, in the same
sense in which _ae_ is vulgarly used.

in Scotland, but afterwards forbidden by Act of Parliament.

  _Acts Marie._

    This was one of the Christmas sports; and, as the ancient
_Saturnalia_ levelled all distinction of ranks, the design of this
amusement was to ridicule the solemnity of the proceedings of an Abbot,
or other dignified clergyman. It is the same with the _Abbot of
Misrule_, and distinguished in name only from the _Boy-Bishop_,
characters formerly well known both in England and in France. The
principal personage was denominated the _Abbot of Unreason_, because his

    Germ. _bieg-en_, flectere, is probably the origin.

BEDDY, _adj._ Expressive of a quality in grey-hounds; the sense
uncertain.

  _Watson's Coll._

    It may signify, attentive to the cry of the huntsman. Fr. _baude_,
"a cry as of hounds, Breton;" Cotgr.  It may, however, be the same word
which occurs in the S. Prov.; "Breeding wives are ay _beddie_;" Kelly,
p. 75. "Covetous of some silly things," N.  In this sense it is probably
allied to Isl. _beid-a_, A. S. _bidd-an_, Moes. G. _bid-jan_, Belg.
_bidd-en_, to ask, to supplicate, to solicit.


BEDE, _pret._ Offered; from the v. ~Bid~.

respecting persons.

  _Gawan and Gol._

3. It undoubtedly signifies, in succession, or "one after another."

  _Gawan and Gol._

    As _belyve_, very similar in sense, is undoubtedly the imperat. of
_belif-an_, q. _wait_, _stay_; _bedene_ may have been formed in the
same manner, from Germ. _bedien-en_, to serve, to obey.


BEDIS, _s. pl._ Prayers.

  _King's Quair._

    Germ. _bed-en_; Germ. _ge-bet_, prayer.  Hence O. E. _bidde_, and
the phrase, _to bidde prayers_, to ask, to solicit them.


BEDE-HOUSE, _s._ A term used for an alms-house, S. B.

  _Statist. Acc._

1. A person who resides in a bede-house, or is supported from the funds
appropriated for this purpose, S.

  _Statist. Acc._

2. In the Court of Exchequer, this term is used to denote one of that
class of paupers who enjoy the royal bounty. The designation has
originated from some religious foundation, in times of popery. _Bedman_
occurs in O. E.

V. ~Assoilyie~, sense 3.

    The origin is A. S. _bead_, a prayer.  Hence, says Verstegan, the
name of _Beads_, "they being made to pray on, and _Beadsman_."

BEDRAL, _s._ A person who is bedrid.

V. ~Orphelin~.


BEDREL, _adj._ Bedrid, Galloway.

    Su. G. _dundr-a_, Belg. _dender-en_, tonare, to thunder.

_To_ BEENGE, BYNGE, _v. a._ To cringe, in the way of making much
obeisance, S.

V. ~Beck~.

  _Ferguson._

    This is undoubtedly from A. S. _bens-ian_, also written _boens-ian_,
to ask as a suppliant; supplicitor petere, orare; _bensiende_,
supplicans.


BEENJIN, improperly written, is expl. "fawning."

3. To besmear; to bedaub, to bespatter. "S. _begaried_, bedirted;" Rudd.
vo. ~Laggerit~.

  _Lyndsay._

    This _v._ has an evident affinity to our _Gair_, _gare_, a stripe
of cloth, and _Gaired_, _gairy_, q. v.  The word is immediately allied
to Fr. _begarr-er_, to diversify; _begarre_, of sundry colours, mingled.


BEGAIRIES, _s. pl._ Stripes or slips of cloth sewed on garments, by way
of ornament, such as are now worn in liveries; _pessments_, S. synon.

    From _be_, by, and _gess_, guess, Belg. _ghisse_.

used by James VI. in his Battle of Lepanto, to denote the weapons of the
_forceats_, or galley-slaves." Gl. Sibb. Hudson writes _beggers' bolts_.

    The word may have originated from contempt of the persons, who used
these arms, q. _bolts_ of _beggars_.


BEGOUTH, BEGOUDE, _pret._ Began.

  _Wyntown._

_Begoud_ is now commonly used, S.

    A. S. _gynn-an_, _beginn-an_,

_Beginnan_, _begeode_.

BEJAN CLASS, a designation given to the Greek class in the Universities
of St Andrew's and Aberdeen; as, till of late, in that of Edinburgh.
Hence, the students in this class are denominated _Bejans_.

    Fr. _bejaune_, a novice, an apprentice, a young beginner in any
science, art, or trade.  Cotgr. derives _bejaune_ from _bec jaulne_,
literally a yellow beak or bill.  Du Cange observes that L. B.
_bejaunus_ signifies a young scholar of any university, and _bejaunium_
the festivity that is held on his arrival. The term is thus very
emphatic, being primarily used in relation to a bird newly hatched,
whose beak is of a deep yellow.


_To_ BEJAN, _v. a._ When a new shearer comes to a harvest-field, he is
initiated by being lifted by the arms and legs, and struck down on a
stone on his buttocks; Fife. This custom has probably had its origin in
some of our universities. It is sometimes called _horsing_.


BEIK, _s._ A hive of bees.

V. ~Byke~.


_To_ BEIK, BEKE, BEEK, _v. a._

  _Barbour._

2. To warm, to communicate heat to.

  _Ramsay._

3. It is often used in a neuter sense, S.

  _Ywaine._

    Belg. _baeker-en_ is used in the same sense; _baeker-en een kindt_,
to warm a child.  We say, To _beik_ in the sun; so, Belg. _baekeren in
de sonne_.  But our word is more immediately allied to the Scandinavian
dialects; Su. G. _bak-a_, to warm.


BEIK, _adj._ Warm.

  _Bannatyne Poems._


BEIK, _s._

1. This word primarily signifying the beak or bill of a fowl, is
"sometimes used for a man's mouth, by way of contempt;" Rudd.

  _Douglas._

2. It is used, as a cant word, for a person; "an auld _beik_," "a queer
_beik_," &c. S.

    Belg. _biek_, Fr. _bec_, rostrum.  It may be observed that the
latter is metaph. applied to a person.

V. ~Bejan~.


_To_ BEIL, BEAL, _v. n._

1. To suppurate, S.

  _Maitland Poems._

2. To swell or rankle with pain, or remorse; metaph. applied to the
mind, S. B.

  _Ross._

  _Wodrow._

    Belg. _buyl-en_, protuberare?  Ihre derives Su. G. _bold_, a boil,
from Isl. _bolg-a_, intumescere.


BEILIN, _s._ A suppuration, S.


BEILD, BIELD, _s._

1. Shelter, refuge, protection, S.

  _Gawan and Gol._

    "Every man bows to the bush he gets _bield_ frae;" S. Prov.  Every
man pays court to him who gives him protection.

2. Support, stay, means of sustenance, S.

  _Douglas._

3. A place of shelter; hence, applied to a house, a habitation; S.

  _Morison._

    A. Bor. _beild_, id.

~Beilding~ also occurs, where it seems doubtful whether buildings or
shelter be meant.

  _Gawan and Gol._

    Isl. _baele_ denotes both a bed or couch, and a cave, a lurking
place; cubile, spelunca.  It is highly probable, that _baele_ is
radically the same with Isl. _boele_, domicilium, habitatio; from
_bo_, to build, to inhabit.


_To_ BEILD, _v. a._

1. To supply, to support.

  _Wallace._

2. In one passage it seems to signify, to take refuge; in a neuter
sense.

  _Gawan and Gol._

    This verb, it would seem, has been formed from the noun, q. v., or
has a common origin with Isl. _bael-a_, used to denote the act of
causing cattle to lie down.


BEILDY, _adj._ Affording shelter.

  _Ramsay._


BEILD, _adj._ Bold.

  _Houlate._

    A. S. _beald_, id.  A. S.  Alem. _belde_, audacia.


BEILL, _s._ Perhaps, sorrow, care, q. _baill_.

  _Bannatyne Poems._


BEIN, _s._ Bone, Ang.

    One is said to be _aw frae the bein_, all from the bone, when proud,
elevated, or highly pleased; in allusion, as would seem, to the fleshy
parts rising from the bone, when the body is swollen.


BEIN, BEYNE, _adj._ ~Beinlier~.

V. ~Bene~.


BEIR, BERE, BIR, BIRR, _s._

1. Noise, cry, roar.

  _Douglas._

The word is used in this sense by R. Glouc.

2. Force, impetuosity; often as denoting the violence of the wind, S.
_Vir_, _virr_, Aberd.

  _Douglas._

    O. E. _bire_, _byre_, _birre_.  The term, especially as used in the
second sense, seems nearly allied to Isl. _byre_ (tempestas), Su. G.
_boer_, the wind; which seem to acknowledge _byr-ia_, _boer-ia_,
surgere, as their root.


_To_ BEIR, BERE, _v. s._ To roar, to make a noise.

  _Wallace._

    Teut. _baeren_, _beren_, is expl. by Kilian; Fremere, sublate et
ferociter clamare more ursorum.  The learned writer seems thus to view
it as a derivative from _baere_, _bere_, a bear.


BEIRD, _s._ A bard, a minstrel.

V. ~Baird~.

  _Douglas._

  _Douglas._

    Here the second pers. is improperly used for the third.  A. S.

_Bin_.

G. _bolg-ia_, _bulg-ia_, to swell.


BELD, _adj._ Bald, without hair on the head, S.

V. ~Bellit~.

  _Burns._

    Seren. derives it from Isl. _bala_, planities.  With fully as much
probability might it be traced to Isl. _bael-a_, vastare, prosternere,
to lay flat.


BELD, _s._ Pattern, model of perfection.

V. ~Beelde~.


BELD, _imperf. v._ Perhaps, took the charge of, or protected.

  _Houlate._

    Fr. _bail_, a guardian.  In this sense it is nearly allied to E.
_bailed_, Fr. _bailler_, to present, to deliver up.  As, however, we
have the word _beild_, shelter, protection, _beld_ may possibly belong
to a verb corresponding in sense.


BELD CYTTES, _s. pl._ Bald coots.

  _Houlate._

    The _bald coot_ receives its name from a _bald_ spot on its head. It
is vulgarly called _bell-kite_, S.

V. ~Beelde~.

_To_ BELE, _v. s._ "To burn, to blaze."

  _Wyntown._

    This, however, may mean, bellowed, roared, from A. S. _bell-an_,
Su. G. _bal-a_, id.  Chaucer uses _belle_ in the same sense.


BELE, _s._ A fire, a blaze.

V. ~Bail~.


_To_ BELEIF, _v. a._ To leave; pret. _beleft_.

    A. S. _be_ and _leof-an_, linquere.

  _Douglas._

BELYVE, BELIFF, BELIUE, BELIFE, _adv._

1. Immediately, quickly.

  _Douglas._

2. By and by, S.

  _Barbour._

This seems to be the only modern sense of the term in S.

3. At length.

  _Douglas._

4. It is used in a singular sense, S. B. _Litle belive_, or _bilive_, a
small remainder.

  _Popular Ball._

    Chaucer _belive_, _blive_, quickly; Gower, _blyve_, id.  Hickes
mentions Franc. _belibe_, as signifying protinus, confestim; and Junius
refers to Norm. Sax. _bilive_.  This is certainly the same word; from
Alem. and Franc. _belib-an_, manere; A. S. _belif-an_, id.


_To_ BELY, _v. a._ To besiege.

  _Spotswood._


TO BELL THE CAT, to contend, with one, especially, of superior rank or
power; to withstand him, either by words or actions; to use strong
measures, without regard to consequences, S.

  _Godscroft._

    Fr. _Mettre la campane au chat_, "to begin a quarrel, to raise a

cat's neck." Cotgr.

  _Bp. Galloway._

    Isl. _belg-ia_, inflare buccas.


BELL-PENNY, _s._ Money laid up, for paying the expence of one's funeral;
from the ancient use of the passing-bell. This word is still used in
Aberbrothick.


BELL-KITE, _s._ The bald Coot.

V. ~Beld Cyttes~.


BELLAN, _s._ Fight, combat.

  _Douglas._

    Lat. _bellum_.


BELLE, _s._ Bonfire.

V. ~Bail~.


BELLING, _s._ The state of desiring the female; a term properly applied
to harts.

  _Douglas._

    Rudd. derives the phrase from Fr. _belier_, a ram; but perhaps it is
rather from Isl. _bael-a_, _bel-ia_, _baul-a_, Germ. _bell-en_, mugire,
boare.


BELLIS, _s. pl._

  _Wallace._


BELLIT, _adj._ Bald.

  _Fordun._

  _Scotichron._


BELLY-BLIND, _s._ The play called Blind-man's buff, S. A.: _Blind
Harie_, synon. S.

    Anciently this term denoted the person who was blindfolded in the
game.

  _Lyndsay._

    In Su. G. this game is called _blind-bock_, i. e. blind goat; and in
Germ. _blinde kuhe_, q. blind cow.  It is probable, that the term is the
same with _Billy Blynde_, mentioned in the Tales of Wonder, and said to
be the name of "a familiar spirit, or good genius."


BELLY-FLAUGHT.

1. To _slay_, or _flay_, _belly-flaught_, to bring the skin overhead, as
in flaying a hare, S. B.

  _Monroe's Iles._

2. It is used in Loth. and other provinces, in a sense considerably
different; as denoting great eagerness or violence in approaching an
object.

  _Ramsay._

3. It is also rendered, "flat forward."

_J. Nicol._


BELLY-HUDDROUN.

V. ~Huddroun~.


BELLY-THRA, _s._ The colic.

  _Gl. Complaynt._

    A. S. _belg_, belly, and _thra_, affliction.  This term, I am
informed, is still used on the Border.


_To_ BELLWAVER, _v. n._

1. To straggle, to stroll, S.

2. To fluctuate, to be inconstant; applied to the mind, S.

    I am informed, however, that the pronunciation of the term in some
places in the west of S. is _bullwaver_; and that it is primarily
applied to a _bull_ when going after the cow, and hence transferred to
man, when supposed to be engaged in some amorous pursuit.

    The origin of the latter part of the v. is obvious; either from E.
_waver_ or L. B. _wayviare_, to stray.  Perhaps the allusion may be to a
ram or other animal, roaming with a _bell_ hung round its neck.


_To_ BELT, _v. a._

1. To gird, S.

Hence, in our old ballads _belted knights_ are often introduced.

2. To gird, metaph. used in relation to the mind.

  _Bellenden._

3. To surround, to environ in a hostile manner.

  _Bellenden._

    Isl. _belt-a_, cingere zona.


_To_ BELT, _v. a._ To flog, to scourge, S.


_To_ BELT, _v. n._ To come forward with a sudden spring, S.

    Isl. _bilt-a_, _bilt-ast_, signifies, to tumble headlong.


BELT, _part. pa._ Built.

  _Douglas._


BELTANE, BELTEIN, _s._ The name of a sort of festival observed on the
first day of May, O. S.; hence used to denote the term of Whitsunday.

  _Peblis to the Play._

    This festival is chiefly celebrated by the cow-herds, who assemble
by scores in the fields, to dress a dinner for themselves, of boiled
milk and eggs.  These dishes they eat with a sort of cakes baked for the
occasion, and having small lumps in the form of _nipples_, raised all
over the surface.  The cake seems to have been an offering to some Deity
in the days of Druidism.--In Ireland, Beltein is celebrated on the 21st
June, at the time of the solstice.  There, as they make fires on the
tops of hills, every member of the family is made to pass through the
fire; as they reckon this ceremony necessary to ensure good fortune
through the succeeding year.--The Gael. and Ir. word _Beal-tine_ or
_Beil-tine_ signifies _Bel's Fire_; as composed of _Baal_ or _Belis_,
one of the names of the sun in Gaul, and _tein_ signifying fire. Even in
Angus a spark of fire is called a _tein_ or _teind_.


BELTH, _s._

  _Douglas._

    This word may denote a whirlpool or rushing of waters.  I am
inclined, however, to view it, either as equivalent to _belch_, only
with a change in the termination, _metri causa_; or as signifying,
figure, image, from A. S. _bilith_, Alem. _bilid_, _bileth_, id.


_To_ BEMANG, _v. a._ To hurl, to injure; to overpower, S. B.

  _Minstrelsy Border._


_To_ BEME, _v. n._

1. To resound, to make a noise.

  _Douglas._

2. To call forth by sound of trumpet.

  _Gawan and Gol._

    Germ. _bomm-en_, resonare; or A. S. _beam_, _bema_, tuba. It is
evident that beme is radically the same with _bommen_, because Germ.
_bomme_, as well as A. S. _beam_, signifies a trumpet.


BEME, _s._ A trumpet; ~Bemys~, pl.

  _Gawan and Gol._

    O. E. _beem_, id.

V. the _v._


BEMYNG, _s._ Bumming, buzzing.

  _Douglas._


BEN, _adv._

1. Towards the inner apartment of a house; corresponding to ~But~, S.

  _Wyntown._

It is also used as a preposition, _Gae ben the house_, Go into the inner
apartment.

A ~But~ _and a_ ~Ben~, S.; i. e. a house containing two rooms.

  _Statist. Acc._

2. It is used metaph. to denote intimacy, favour, or honour. Thus it is
said of one, who is admitted to great familiarity with another, who
either is, or wishes to be thought his superior; _He is far ben_. "_O'er
far ben_, too intimate or familiar," Gl. Shirr.

  _Lyndsay._

Leg. as in edit. 1670, _far ben_.

    A. S. _binnan_, Belg. _binnen_, intus, (within); _binnen-kamer_,
locus secretior in penetralibus domus; Kilian.  Belg. _binnen gaan_, to
go within, S. _to gae ben_; _binnen brengen_, to carry within, S. _to
bring ben_.


BEN-END, _s._

1. _The ben-end of a house_, the inner part of it, S.

2. Metaph., the best part of any thing; as, _the ben-end of one's
dinner_, the principal part of it, S. B.


BEN-HOUSE, _s._ The inner or principal apartment, S.


BENNER, _adj._ A comparative formed from _ben_. Inner, S. B.

    Teut. _binnenste_ is synon.


BEN-INNO, _prep._ Within, beyond, S. B.

  _Journal Lond._

    From _ben_, q. v. and A. S. _inne_, or _innon_, within; Alem.
_inna_; Isl. _inne_, id.

~There-ben~, _adv._ Within, in the inner apartment, S.

V. ~Thairben~.

_To_ BEND, _v. n._ To drink hard; a cant term, S.

  _Ramsay._


BEND, _s._ A pull of liquor, S.

  _Ramsay._


BENDER, _s._ A hard drinker, S.

  _Ramsay._


BENE, _v. subst._ Are.

  _Bellenden._

    Chaucer, _ben_, id. from _beon_, third p. pl. subj. of the A. S.
substantive verb.


BENE is also used for _be_.

  _King's Quair._


BENE, BEIN, BEYNE, BIEN, _adj._

1. Wealthy, well-provided, possessing abundance, S.

  _Henrysone._

    This is perhaps the most common sense of the term, S.  Thus we say,
_A bene_ or _bein farmer_, a wealthy farmer, one who is in easy, or even
in affluent circumstances; _a bein laird_, &c.

2. Warm, genial. In this sense it is applied to a fire, S.

  _Douglas._

3. Pleasant.

  _Douglas._

4. Happy, blissful, S.

  _Ferguson._

5. Splendid, showy.

  _Wallace._

6. Good, excellent in its kind.

  _Dunbar._

7. Eager, new-fangled. People are said to be _bein_ upon any thing that
they are very fond of, Loth. In this sense _bayne_ occurs in O. E.

    Isl. _bein-a_ signifies to prosper, to give success to any
undertaking.  _Bein_, as allied to this, signifies hospitable; _beine_,
hospitality, hospitis advenae exhibita beneficentia.  G. Andr. mentions
the v. _beina_, as signifying, hospitii beneficia praestare.  _Beini_,
hospitality, liberality.


BENELY, BEINLY, _adv._ In the possession of fulness, S.

  _L. Scotland's Lament._


BENE, _adv._ Well; _full bene_, full well.

  _Douglas._

    This word is most probably from Lat. _bene_, well.


BENJEL, _s._ A heap, a considerable quantity; as "a _benjel_ of coals,"
when many are laid at once on the fire, S. B. _Bensil_, however, is used
in the same sense in the South and West of S.

V. ~Bensell~.


BENK, BINK, _s._ A bench, a seat. It seems sometimes to have denoted a
seat of honour.

  _Kelly._

V. ~Bend~.

severely scolded, S.

4. _Bensil of a fire_, a strong fire, South and West of S.

    It is not unlikely that the word was originally _bent-sail_, as
alluding to a vessel driven by the force of the winds.


_To_ BENSEL, _v. a._ To bang, or beat, Gl. Sibb. "_Bensel_, to beat or
bang. Vox rustica, Yorksh." Gl. Grose.


BENSHAW, BEANSHAW, _s._ A disease, apparently of horses.

  _Polwart._

    Formed perhaps from A. S. _ban_, Teut. _been_, os, and _hef_,
elevatio; q. the swelling of the bone.


BENSHIE, BENSHI, _s._ Expl. "Fairy's wife."

  _Pennant._

    It has been observed, that this being, who is still reverenced as
the tutelar daemon of ancient Irish families, is of pure Celtic origin,
and owes her title to two Gaelic words, _Ben_ and _sighean_, signifying
the head or chief of the fairies.  But it seems rather derived from Ir.
Gael. _ben_, _bean_ a woman, said by Obrien to be the root of the Lat.
_Venus_, and _sighe_, a fairy or hobgoblin.


BENT, _s._

1. A coarse kind of grass, growing on hilly ground, S. Agrostis

_To_ BER _on hand_.

V. ~Bear~.


BERBER, _s._ Barberry, a shrub.

  _Sir Gawan and Sir Gol._

    L. B. _berberis_, Sw. id.


BERE, _s._ Noise; also, To ~Bere~.

V. ~Beir~.


BERE, _s._ Boar.

V. ~Bair~.

  _Douglas._


BERE, _s._ Barley.

  _Wyntown._


BERGLE, BERGELL, _s._ The wrasse, a fish, Orkn.

  _Barry._

    The first syllable of its name is undoubtedly from Isl. _berg_, a
rock. Had it any resemblance to the eel, we might suppose the last from
_aal_, q. the _rock eel_.


BERHEDIS, _s. pl._ Heads of boars.

V. ~Bere~.

  _Gawan and Gal._


BERIT, _imperf._

V. ~Beir~, _v._


_To_ BERY, BERYSS, BERISCH, _v. a._

To inter, to bury.

  _Douglas._

    A. S. _byrig-an_, id. Junius says that A. S. _byrig-an_ is
literally, tumulare. It may, however, be supposed that the primitive
idea is found in Isl. _birg-ia_, Franc. _berg-an_, to cover, to hide,
to defend.


BERIIS, _s._ Sepulture.

    A. S. _byrigels_, sepultura. _Birielis_ is accordingly used by
Wiclif for tombs.


BERYNES, BERYNISS, _s._ Burial, interment.

  _Barbour._

    A. S. _byrignesse_, sepultura.


BERY BROUNE, a shade of brown approaching to red.

  _Gawan. and Gol._

    We still say, "as brown as a _berry_," S.  A. S. _beria_, bacca.


BERLE, _s._ Beryl, a precious stone.

  _Houlate._

    From this _s._ Doug. forms the adj. _beriall_, shining like beryl.


BERLY, _adj._ Apparently, strong, mighty.

  _Henrysone._

    This word is the same, I suspect, with E. _burly_, strong. If
_berly_ be the ancient word, either from Germ. _bar_, vir illustris; or
from _baer_, ursus; especially as Su. G. _biorn_, id. was metaph. used
to denote an illustrious personage.


BERN, BERNE, _s._

1. A baron.

  _Wallace._

2. It is often used in a general sense, as denoting a man of rank or
authority; or one who has the appearance of rank, although the degree of
it be unknown.

  _Gawan and Gol._

3. A man in general.

  _Douglas._

    A. S. _beorne_, princeps, homo, Benson; "a prince, a nobleman, a man
of honour and dignity," Somner. _Bern_, as denoting a man, in an
honourable sense, may be from A. S. _bar_, free, or Lat. _baro_, used by
Cicero, as equivalent to a lord or peer of the realm.


BERN, _s._ A barn, a place for laying up and threshing grain.

  _Gawan and Gol._

    A. S. _bern_, id.  Junius supposes that this is comp. of _bere_,
barley, and _ern_, place, q. "the place where barley is deposited," Gl.
Goth.


BERSIS, _s._ "A species of cannon formerly much used at sea. It
resembled the faucon, but was shorter, and of a larger calibre," Gl.
Compl.

  _Complaynt S._

    Fr. _barce_, _berche_, "the piece of ordnance called a base;" Cotgr.
pl. _barces_, _berches_.

BERTHINSEK, BIRDINSEK, BURDINSECK. _The law of Berthinsek_, a law,
according to which no man was to be punished capitally for stealing a
calf, sheep, or so much meat as he could carry on his back in a sack.

  _Skene._

  _Wyntown._

    The term is still used in this general sense, S. pronounced q.
_baist_.  S. B.


BEST-MAN, _s._ Brideman; as _best-maid_ is bride-maid; from having the
_principal_ offices in waiting on the bride, S.


BESTIAL, (_off Tre_) _s._ An engine for a siege.

  _Wallace._

    It seems uncertain, whether this word be formed from Lat.
_bestialis_, as at first applied to the engines called _rams_, _sows_,
&c., or from Fr. _bastille_, a tower; L. B. _bastillae_.

BET, BETT, _pret._ and _part._ Helped, supplied.

V. ~Beit~.

  _Douglas._

    This is a secondary and oblique sense of the _v._ _Beit_, q. v.


BET, _adj._ Better.

  _King's Quair._

    A. S. _bet_, Teut. _bat_, _bet_, melius, potius, magis; Alem. _bas_,
_baz_, melior, the compar. of _bat_, bonus.  A. S. _bet-an_, emendare,
and the other synon. verbs in the Northern languages, have been viewed
as originating the term.  _Bet_, indeed, seems to be merely the past
part., mended, i. e. made _better_.


BETANE, _part. pa._ Perhaps, inclosed.

  _Barbour._

    A. S. _betien-en_, _betyn-an_, to inclose, to shut up.

ourselves to the protection of some superior being. O. E. _bitoke_,
committed; also _bitaughten_, _bitakun_, _bitauht_. A. S. _betaec-an_,
tradere, concedere, assignare, commendare; to deliver, to grant, to
assign or appoint, to betake or recommend unto; Somner. _Betaehte_,

BETWEESH, _prep._ Betwixt, S.

V. ~Atweesh~.


BEVAR, _s._ One who is worn out with age.

  _Henrysone._

    It is evidently from the same source with _Bavard_, adj. q. v. We
still say a _bevir-horse_ for a lean horse, or one worn out with age or
hard work; S.


BEVEL, _s._ A stroke; sometimes, a violent push with the elbow, S.

  _Many._

    This is a derivative from _Baff_, _beff_, q. v.


BEVEREN, BEVERAND, _part. pr._

  _Sir Gawan and Sir Gal._

    Perhaps from A. S. _befer-an_, circumdare; or as the same with
_beverand_, which Sibb. renders "shaking, nodding;" deriving it from
Teut. _bev-en_, contremere.  This is a provincial E. word. "_Bevering_,
trembling. North." Gl. Grose.


BEVIE, (_of a fire_) _s._ A term used to denote a great fire; sometimes,
_bevice_, S.

    Perhaps from E. _bavin_, "a stick like those bound up in faggots,"
Johnson. It is thus used in O. E.


BEVIE, _s._ A jog, a push, S. from the same source with _bevel_.

V. ~Baff~, _s._

  _Douglas._

    A. S. _bug-an_, curvare.


BEUGH, _s._ (gutt.) A limb, a leg, Border.

  _Evergreen._

    Isl. _bog_, Alem. _puac_, Germ. _bug_, id.  The term is applied both
to man and to other animals.  Both Ihre and Wachter view _bug-en_, to
bend, as the origin; as it is by means of its joints that an animal
bends itself.


BEUGLE-BACKED, _adj._ Crook-backed.

  _Watson._

    A. S. _bug-an_, to bow; Teut. _boechel_, gibbus. Germ. _bugel_, a
dimin. from _bug_, denoting any thing curved or circular.  It is
undoubtedly the same word that is now pronounced _boolie-backit_, S.

  _Douglas._

    A. S. _boc_, pret. of _bac-an_, pinsere.

  _Maitland Poems._


BEWITH, _s._ A thing which is employed as a substitute for another,
although it should not answer the end so well.

  _Ramsay._

One who arrives, when the regular dinner is eaten, is said to get "only
a _bewith_ for a dinner," S.

    From the subst. v. conjoined with the prep., q. what one must submit
to for a time.


_To_ BEWRY, _v. a._ To pervert, to distort.

  _Douglas._

    Teut. _wroegh-en_, torquere, angere.


BY, _prep._

1. Beyond, S.

  _Pitscottie._

2. Besides, over and above.

  _Pitscottie._

3. Away from, without, without regard to, contrary to.

  _Wallace._

    _By_, as thus used, is sometimes directly contrasted with _be_, as
signifying _by_ in the modern sense of the term.  This may be viewed as
an oblique sense of _by_ as signifying _beyond_; perhaps in allusion to
an arrow that flies wide from the mark.

4. In a way of distinction from, S.

  _Wallace._


BY, _adv._ When, after; q. by the time that.

  _Pitscottie._

    This idiom is very ancient, Moes. G. _Bi the galithun thai
brothrjus is_; _When_ his brethren were gone up.


BY-HAND, _adv._ Over, S.

V. ~Hand~.


BY-LYAR, _s._ A neutral.

  _Knox._

    From the _v_. _To lie by_, E.


BIAS, a word used as a mark of the superlative degree; _bias bonny_,
very handsome; _bias hungry_, very hungry, Aberd.


BIB, _s._ A term used to denote the stomach, Ang., borrowed, perhaps,
from the use of that small piece of linen, thus denominated, which
covers the breast or stomach of a child.


BYBILL, _s._ A large writing, a scroll so extensive that it may be
compared to a book.

  _Detection Q. Mary._

    The word occurs in a similar sense in O. E.  As used by Chaucer,
Tyrwhitt justly renders it "any great book." In the dark ages, when
books were scarce, those, which would be most frequently mentioned,
would doubtless be the _Bible_ and _Breviary_. Or, this use of the word
may be immediately from L. B. _biblus_, a book, (Gr. {~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}), which
occurs in this sense from the reign of Charlemagne downwards.


BICHMAN, _s._ Perhaps, for _buthman_, q. _boothman_, one who sells goods
in a _booth_.

  _Dunbar._

    In edit. 1508, it is _buthman_.

_To_ BICKER, BYKER, _v. a._ This _v_., as used in S., does not merely
signify, "to fight, to skirmish, to fight off and on," as it is defined
in E. dictionaries. It also denotes,

1. The constant motion of weapons of any kind, and the rapid succession
of strokes, in a battle or broil.

  _Wallace._

2. To fight by throwing stones; S.

3. To move quickly; S.

4. It expresses the noise occasioned by successive strokes, by throwing
of stones, or by any rapid motion; S.

1. To await, to wait for.

  _Kelly._

2. To suffer, to endure. "He _bides_ a great deal of pain;" S.
Westmorel, id.

  _Ross._

    An oblique sense of Moes. G. _beid-an_, A. S. _bid-an_, expectare.


_To_ BIDE _be_, _v. n._ To continue in one state, S.


BIDINGS, _s. pl._ Sufferings.

BY-EAST, towards the east.

V. ~Be~, _prep._


BIERDLY, BIERLY, _adj._

  _Popular Ball._

    It is viewed as the same with _Burdly_, q. v. But to me it seems
rather to signify, fit, proper, becoming, from Isl. _byr-iar_, _ber_,
decet, oportet.


BIERLING, _s._ A galley, S. B.

  _Statist. Acc._


BIG, BIGG, _s._ A particular species of barley, also denominated _bear_,

_To_ BIG, BYG, _v. a._ To build; S., Cumb., Westmorel., id.

  _Wallace._

    This word occurs in O. E. although not very frequently.  A. S.
_bycg-an_, Isl. _bygg-ia_, Su. G. _bygg-a_, aedificare, instruere, a
frequentative from _bo_, id.; as it is customary with the Goths thus to
augment monosyllables in _o_; as _sugg-a_ from _so_, a sow.


BIGGAR, _s._ A builder, one who carries on a building.

  _Acts Marie._


BIGGING, BYGGYN, BYGGYNGE, _s._ A building; a house, properly of a

  _Wallace._

    _Biggin_, a building, Gl.  Westmorel.  Isl. _bigging_, structura.

    This word is used in various senses, S.

BIGONET, _s._ A linen cap or coif.

  _Ramsay._

    From the same origin with E. _biggin_, "a kind of coif, or linen-cap
for a young child;" Phillips.  Fr. _beguin_. id.


BYGANE, BIGANE, BYGONE, _adj._

1. Past; S. The latter is mentioned by Dr Johnson as "a Scotch word."

  _Acts Ja. I._

2. Preceding; equivalent to E. predeceased.

  _Douglas._


BYGANES, BIGONES, used as _s. pl._ denoting what is past, but properly
including the idea of transgression or defect.

1. It denotes offences against the sovereign, or the state, real or
supposed.

  _Baillie._

2. It is used in relation to the quarrels of lovers, or grounds of
offence give by either party, S.

  _Pennant._

4. Metaph. an association or collective body; S.

  _Lyndsay._

_To skail the byke_, metaph. to disperse an assembly of whatever kind;
S.

    Isl. _biik-ar_ denotes a hive, alvear; and Teut. _bie-bock_,
_bie-buyck_, apiarium, alvearium, Kilian.  The Isl. word is probably
from Su. G. _bygg-a_, to build, part. pa. _bygdt_; q. something prepared
or built.  There seems to be no reason to doubt that the word, as used
in sense 2, is the same with that denoting a habitation.  For what is a
_byke_ or _bee-bike_, but a building or habitation of bees?


BYK, Apparently, an errat. for _byt_, bite.

  _Dunbar._


BYKAT, BEIKAT, _s._ A male salmon; so called, when come to a certain
age, because of the _beak_ which grows in his under jaw; Ang.


BILBIE, _s._ Shelter, residence; Ang.

    This, I apprehend, is a very ancient word. It may be either from
Su.G. _byle_, habitaculum, and _by_, pagus, conjoined, as denoting
residence in a village; or more simply, from _Bolby_, villa primaria;
from _bol_, praedium, and _by_, a village. Thus _bolby_ would signify a
village which has a _praedium_, or territory of its own, annexed to it.


BILEFT, _pret._ Remained, abode.

  _Sir Tristrem._

    A. S. _belif-an_, superesse, to remain; Alem. _bilib-en_, Franc,
_biliu-en_, manere; Schilter.


BILGET, _adj._ Bulged, jutting out.

    Su. G. _bulg-ia_, to swell, whence Isl. _bylgia_, a billow.  Or,

  _Ramsay._

  _Evergreen._

Still used in this sense, S. B.

5. A brother, S.

  _Minstrelsy Border._

6. Apparently used in allusion to brotherhood in arms, according to the
ancient laws of chivalry.

  _Minstrelsy Border._

7. A young man. In this sense it is often used in the pl. _The billies_,
or, _the young billies_, S. B.

It is expl. "a stout man, a clever fellow," Gl. Shirr.

8. Sometimes it signifies a boy, S. B. as synon. with _callan_.

  _Ross._

    It is probably allied to Su. G. Germ. _billig_, Belg. _billik_,
equalis; as denoting those that are on a footing as to age, rank,
relation, affection, or employment.


BILLIT, _adj._ "Shod with iron," Rudd. _Billit ax_.

  _Douglas._

    This phrase is perhaps merely a circumlocution for the _bipennis_, or
large ax.

V. ~Balax~.


BILTER, _s._ A child, Dumfr.; Isl. _pilter_, puellus.


BIN, _s._ A mountain, S. O.

  _Galloway._

    From Gael. _ben_, id., Lomond _bin_, being synon. with _Benlomond_.


BIND, BINDE, _s._

1. Dimension, size; especially with respect to circumference. A barrel
of a certain _bind_, is one of certain dimensions, S.; hence _Barrell
bind_.

  _Acts Ja. III._

2. It is used more generally to denote size in any sense.

  _Acts Marie._

3. Metaph. to denote ability. "Aboon my _bind_" beyond my power. This is
often applied to pecuniary ability; S.

    This use of the word is evidently borrowed from the idea of _binding_ a
vessel with hoops.


BINDLE, _s._ The cord or rope that binds any thing, whether made of hemp
or of straw; S.

    Su. G. _bindel_, a headband, a fillet, from _bind-as_, to bind.
Teut. _bindel_, ligamen.


BINDWOOD, _s._ The vulgar name for ivy, S.; Hedera helix, Linn.; pron.
_binwud_.

    Denominated, perhaps, from the strong hold that it takes of a wall,
a rock, trees, &c. q. the _binding wood_. It is probably the same which
is written _benwood_.

  _Statist. Acc._


BING, _s._

1. A heap in general.

  _Lyndsay._

2. A heap of grain, S.

3. A pile of wood; immediately designed as a funeral pile.

4. "A temporary inclosure or repository made of boards, twigs, or straw
ropes, for containing grain or such like;" Gl. Sibb., where it is also
written _binne_.

    Dan. _bing_, Sw. _binge_, Isl. _bing-r_, cumulus.


_To_ BYNGE, _v. n._ To cringe.

V. ~Beenge~.


_To_ BINK, _v. a._ To press down, so as to deprive any thing of its
proper shape. It is principally used as to shoes, when, by careless
wearing, they are allowed to fall down in the heels; S.

    O. Teut. _bangh-en_, premere, in angustum cogere. Sw. _bank-a_, to
beat seems allied; q. to beat down.


BINK, _s._

1. A bench, a seat; S. B.

  _Priests of Peblis._

    Lat. _baptizo_.

V. ~Beir~.


BIRD, BEIRD, BRID, BURD, _s._

1. A lady, a damsel.

  _Gawan and Gol._

    As _bridde_ is the word used by Chaucer for bird, it is merely the
A. S. term for pullus, pullulus.  _Bird_, as applied to a damsel,
appears to be the common term used in a metaph. sense.

2. Used, also metaph., to denote the young of quadrupeds, particularly
of the fox.

V. ~Tod's Birds~.


BYRD, _v. imp._ It behoved, it became.

  _Barbour._

    A. S. _byreth_, pertinet. This imp. v. may have been formed from
_byr-an_, _ber-an_, to carry, or may be viewed as nearly allied to it.
Hence _bireth_, gestavit; Germ. _berd_, _ge-baerd_, id., _sich berd-en_,
gestum facere.  Su. G. _boer-a_, debere, pret. _borde_, anciently
_boerjade_.

  _Ramsay._


BYRE, _s._ Cowhouse, S. _Byer_, id. Cumb.

  _Gawan and Gol._

    Perhaps allied to Franc. _buer_, a cottage; _byre_, Su. G. _byr_, a
village; Germ. _bauer_, habitaculum, cavea; from Su. G. _bo_, _bu-a_, to
dwell.  Or from Isl. _bu_, a cow; Gael. _bo_, id.


BIRK, _s._ Birch, a tree; S. Betula alba, Linn.

  _Douglas._

    A. S. _birc_, Isl. _biorki_, Teut. _berck_, id.

Hence,

BIRKY, _s._

1. A lively young fellow; a person of mettle; S.

  _Poems Buchan Dial._

2. _Auld Birky_, "In conversation, analogous to   _Old Boy_," Gl. Shirr.

  _Douglas._

4. To club money for the purpose of procuring drink. "I'll _birle_ my
bawbie," I will contribute my share of the expence; S.

  _Ramsay._

    In Isl. it is used in the first sense; _byrl-a_, infundere, miscere
potum.  In A. S. it occurs in sense third, _biril-ian_, _birl-ian_,
haurire.  Hence _byrle_, a butler.  Isl. _byrlar_, id. _Birle_, O. E.
has the same signification.


_To_ BIRL, _v. n._

V. ~Birr~, _v._


BIRLAW-COURT, also BIRLEY-COURT.

V. ~Burlaw~.


BIRLEY-OATS, BARLEY-OATS, _s. pl._ A species of oats, S.

_barley_.


BIRLIE, _s._ A loaf of bread; S. B.


BIRLIN, _s._ A small vessel used in the Western Islands.

  _Martin._

Gael. the word is written _bhuirlin_.

that defend themselves, or express their rage in this way, S.

  _Course of Conformitie._

    A. S. _byrst_, Germ. _borst_, _burst_, Su. G. _borst_, id.  Ihre
derives it from _burr_, a thistle.  Sw. _saettia up borsten_, to put one

    A. S. _biscoprice_, episcopatus.


BISHOP'S FOOT. It is said, _The Bishop's foot has been in the broth_,
when they are singed, S.

    This phrase seems to have had its origin in times of Popery, when
the clergy had such extensive influence, that hardly any thing could be
done without their interference. A similar phrase is used A. Bor. "_The
bishop has set his foot in it_, a saying in the North, used for milk
that is burnt-to in boiling."

BIT, _s._ A vulgar term used for food, S.

_Bit and baid_, meat and clothing, S. B.

    A. S. _byt_, morsus, metaph. used.

Virgil by heart;" I committed to memory a great many verses from Virgil.

To _ding in blads_, to drive in pieces.

  _Melville's MS._

    This word, as perhaps originally applied to food, may be from A. S.
_blaed_, fruit of any kind; _blaed_, _bled_, also denoted _pot-herbs_;
Ir. _bladh_, a part; _bladh-am_, I break.

_Blads and dawds_, is still the designation given to large leaves of
greens boiled whole, in a sort of broth, Aberd. Loth.


BLAD, _s._ A person who is of a soft constitution; whose strength is not
in proportion to his size or looks; often applied to a young person, who
has become suddenly tall, but is of a relaxed habit, S. B.

    Allied, perhaps, to A. S. _blaed_, as denoting, either the boughs or
leaves of trees, or growing corn; as both often shoot out so rapidly as
to give the idea of weakness; or, to Germ. _blode_, the original sense
of which is, weak, feeble.


BLAD, _s._ A portfolio, S. B.

    As the E. word is comp. of Fr. _porter_, to carry, and _feuille_, a

3. To slap, to strike; to drive by striking, or with violence, S. _Dad_,
synon.

  _Evergreen._

    Germ. _blodern_ is used in the first sense. _Es blodert_, it storms
and snows; also, _blat-en_, to blow. Isl. _blaegt-a_ indeed signifies,
to be moved by the wind, motari aura; O. Fr. _plaud-er_, to bang, to
maul.


BLAD, _s._ A squall; always including the idea of rain, S. A heavy fall

BLAIN, _s._ A blank, a vacancy.

    Probably a metaph. use of the preceding word.


BLAIR, _s._ That part of flax which is afterwards used in manufacture,
properly after it has been steeped, and laid out for being dried; for it
is subsequently called _lint_, S. This in E. is denominated _harle_.

    Sw. _blaer_, hards of flax; but rather from Isl. _blaer_, aura,
because it is thus exposed to the drought.

now speak of a blunt reason or excuse. Isl. _blaad-ur_, _blauth-ur_,
_blaud_, soft.  The word seems to be primarily applied to things which

BLAITIE-BUM, s. Simpleton, stupid fellow.

  _Lyndsay._

vaniloquus; or rather, blait, sheepish, and _bomme_, tympanum.  But it
is generally written _Batie-bum_, q. v.


BLAK _of the_ EIE, the apple of the eye, S.

  _Sir J. Sinclair._

4. A gleam of prosperity, during adversity.

  _Godscroft._

5. Also transferred to a glance, a stroke of the eye, or transient view

the sun when the sky is much obscured with clouds, S.

  _Douglas._

6. A kindly glance, a transient glance expressive of regard, S.

  _Burns._

7. A moment. "I'll not stay a _blink_," I will return immediately. _In a

BLENT, _s._ A glance.

  _Douglas._


BLENT, _pret._ Lost, as applied to sight.

  _King's Quair._

_blind_, deficiens.

  _Chron. S. Poet._


BLIND HARIE, Blind man's buff, S. _Belly-blind_, synon.

  _Herd._

    In the Scandinavian _Julbock_, from which this sport seems to have
originated, the principal actor was disguised in the skin of a _buck_ or
_goat_.  The name _Blind Harie_ might therefore arise from his rough
attire; as he was called _blind_, in consequence of being blindfolded.
Or it may signify, _Blind Master_, or _Lord_, in ironical language.

V. ~Herie~.


BLIND MAN'S BALL, or _Devil's snuff-box_, Common puff-ball, S. V. Flor.
Suec.

of _Bleib_.

joined with _Greet_. To _blirt and greet_, i. e. to burst out a-crying,

our v. is immediately formed from the adj.


BLITHEMEAT, _s._ The meat distributed among those who are present at the
birth of a child, or among the rest of the family, S. pronounced
_blyidmeat_, Ang. as the adj. itself, _blyd_, _blyid_.

occasioned by a safe delivery.

  _Houlate._


BLYWEST, _adj._ in the superl.

from A. S. _be_, a common prefix, and _leom-an_ to shine, as _gleam_ is
from _geleom-an_, id.


BLONK, BLOUK, _s._ A steed, a horse,

  _Gawan and Gol._

    Alem. _planchaz_, equus pallidus, hodie _blank_; Schilter. Thus
_blonk_ may have originally meant merely a _white_ horse, q. Fr. _blanc_
cheval.


BLONKS, _s. pl._

  _King Hart._

    If this does not denote horses, as above, it may mean _blocks_ of
wood.

2. A pettish humour.

3. To belch, (eructare) S.

    A. Bor. _boke_, _bowk_, to nauseate, to be ready to vomit; _booac_,
to reach, to keck, ibid. Perhaps from A. S. _bealc-an_, eructare. It
however has greater resemblance of _puke_, to which no etymon has been
assigned.


BOK, BOCK, _s._ The act of reaching, S.

  _Cleland._


BOKEIK, _s._ Bopeep, a game.

_To_ BOLDIN, BOLDYN, _v. n._ To swell.

  _Douglas._

~Boldin~, ~Boulden~, _part. pa._ swelled.

    This is softened into _bowdin_, _bowden_, S.  Often in the _pret._
and _part._ it is written _bolnys_, swells, (Doug. V.) and _bolnyt_.  I
hesitate whether these are contr. from _boldinnys_, _boldinnyt_, or the
v. in another form, more nearly resembling Su. G. _buln-a_, Dan.
_bul-ner_.  Su. G. _bul-na_, _bulg-ia_, id. _bolginn_, swollen.  Hence
Isl. bilgia, Su. G. bolgia, a billow; because it is raised by the wind;
and _bolda_, a boil, a tumour.  Gael. _builg-am_ to swell, _builg_, a
blister.


BOLGAN LEAVES, Nipplewort, an herb, S. B. Lapsana communis, Linn.

    Perhaps from Isl. _bolg-a_, tumere, or Su. G. _bolginn_, swollen,
q. "swelling leaves," as being supposed by the vulgar in S. to be
efficacious in removing swellings.


_To_ BOLYN, _v. n._ To lay tack aboard.

    O. Fr. _bolin-er_, to sail by a wind, or close upon a wind.


BOLL, _Lintseed Boll_.

BOLLMAN, _s._ A cottager, Orkn.

  _Statist. Acc._

    Perhaps from Su. G. Isl. _bol_, villa, and _man_, q. the inhabitant
of a village. It is always pronounced _bowman_.


BOLME, _s._ A boom, a waterman's pole.

  _Douglas._

    Germ. _baum_, Belg. _boom_, a tree.

BONALAIS, BONAILIE, BONNAILLIE, _s._ A drink taken with a friend, when
one is about to part with him; as expressive of one's wishing him a
prosperous journey, S.

  _Wallace._

    It is now generally pron. _bonaillie_, S. _Bonalais_ might seem to
be the plur. But perhaps it merely retains the form of Fr. _Bon allez_.


BONE, _s._ A petition, a prayer.

  _Douglas._

    O. E. id. Isl. _baen_, precatio, oratio; _boon_ petitio, gratis
acceptio, mendicatio, G. Andr. A. S. _ben_, _bene_, id.


BONETT, _s._ "A small sail, fixed to the bottom or sides of the great
sails, to accelerate the ship's way in calm weather." Gl. Compl.

  _Douglas._

    Fr. _bonnette_, Sw. _bonet_, id.


BONIE, BONYE, BONNY, _adj._

1. Beautiful, pretty, S.

  _Maitland Poems._

_Boniest_, most beautiful.

  _Montgomerie._

2. It is occasionally used ironically, in the same way with E. _pretty_,
S.

  _Priests of Peblis._

3. Precious, valuable.

  _Minstrelsy Border._

    _Bonny_ is used in the same sense by Shakspeare, and since his time
by some other E. writers.  But I suspect that it is properly S.  Johnson
derives it from Fr. _bon_, _bonne_, good.  This is by no means
satisfactory; but we must confess that we cannot substitute a better
etymon.


BONYNES, _s._ Beauty, handsomeness.

  _Philotus_.


BONK, _s._ Bank.

  _Douglas._

    Probably corr. from A. S. _bene_.  Isl. _bunga_, however, signifies
tumor terrae.

proprietor's corn.

  _Statist. Acc._

BONSPEL, _s._ A match, at the diversion of _curling_ on the ice, between
two opposite parties, S.

V. ~Curl~.

  _Graeme._

    Belg. _bonne_, a village, a district, and _spel_, play; because the
inhabitants of different villages or districts contend with each other
in this sport, one parish, for example, challenging another.  Or, the
first syllable may be traced to Su. G. _bonde_, an husbandman.


BONXIE, _s._ The name given to the Skua Gull, Shetl.

  _Neill._


BOO, BOW, _s._ A term sometimes used to denote a farm-house or village,
in conjunction with the proper name, Ang.

    Su. G. _bo_, Isl. _bu_, _boo_, domicilium, a house or dwelling, also,
a village; Moes. G. _baua_, id.

In the Orkney Islands, where the Gothic was long preserved in greater
purity than in our country, the principal farm-house on an estate, or in
any particular district of it, is in a great many instances called the
_Boll_ or _Bow_.

  _Barry._


BOODIES, _pl._ Ghosts, hobgoblins, Aberd.

  _Journal Lond._

    It might be deduced from A. S. _boda_, a messenger, from _bod-ian_,
to declare, to denounce.  But it seems to be rather originally the same
with C. B. _bugudhai_, hobgoblins, Gael. _bodach_, a ghost.


BOOL, _s._ A contemptuous term for a man, especially if advanced in
years. It is often conjoined with an epithet; as "an auld _bool_," an

and feet.


BOOLS _of a pot_, _s. pl._ Two crooked instruments of iron, linked
together, used for lifting a pot by the ears, S.; also called _clips_.

    Teut. _boghel_, numella; Germ. _bugel_, any thing that is circular
or curved.


BOOL-HORNED, _adj._ Perverse, obstinate, inflexible, S. apparently from
the same origin with ~Bools~.

    _Boolie-horned_, Border, and W. of S.  A. Bor. _buckle-horns_, short
crooked horns turned horizontally inwards.


BOONMOST, _adj._ Uppermost, S. pron. _bunemist_.

    A. S. _bufan_, _bufon_, above, and _most_.


BOOT, BUT, BOUD, BIT, BUD, BOOST, _v. imp._ Behoved, was under a
necessity of, S.; _He boot to do_ such a thing; he could not avoid it.
_It bit to be_; it was necessary that this should take place.

  _Ross. Burns._

    _Bus_ and _bud_ occur in the same sense in Ywaine and Gawin.  Most
probably it is a corr. of _behoved_, Belg. _behoeft_.


BOOST, _s._ A box.

V. ~Buist~.


BOR, BOIR, BORE, _s._

1. A small hole or crevice; a place used for shelter, especially by

person who becomes bail for another, for whatever purpose.

  _Wallace._

2. A pledge; any thing laid in pawn.

  _Barbour._

    The term occurs in both senses in O. E.  A. S. _borg_, _borh_,
fide-jussor; also, foenus; Germ. _burge_, a pledge.  Su. G. _borgen_,
suretyship.  Ihre derives Su. G. and Isl. _borg-a_, to become surety,
from _berg-a_, a periculo tueri, to protect from danger.  The idea is
certainly most natural:  For what is suretyship, but warranting the
_safety_ of any person or thing?


_To_ BORCH, _v. a._ To give a pledge or security for, to bail.

  _Wallace._


_To_ BORROW, BORW, _v. a._

1. To give security for; applied to property.

2. To become surety for; applied to a person.

_Baron Courts._

    Su. G. _borg-a_, id.


_To_ BORROW _one_, to urge one to drink, Ang.

    When one _pledges_ another in company, he engages to drink after
him; and in ancient times it was generally understood, that he who
pledged another, was engaged to drink an equal quantity.


BORROWGANGE, s. A state of suretyship.

  _Reg. Maj._

    Su. G. _edgaang_, _laggaang_, are rendered by Ihre, actus jurandi,
from _gaa_, ire; _borrowgange_ may thus be merely the act of _going_ or
_entering_ as a surety.


BORD, _s._

1. A broad hem or welt, S.

2. The edge or border of a woman's cap, S.

    Fr. _bord_, Belg. _boord_, a welt, a hem, or selvage; Isl. _bard_,
_bord_, the extremity or margin.


BORDEL, _s._ A brothel, Dunbar.

    Fr. _bordel_, id., Su. G.  A. S. _bord_, a house.  The dimin. of
this, Ihre says, was L. B. _bordell-um_, _bordil-e_, tuguriolum, cujus
generis quum olim meretricum stabula essent.


BORDELLAR, _s._ A haunter of brothels.

suretyship; q. one under contract or obligation.


BORROWING DAYS, the three last days of March, Old Stile, S.

  _Complaynt S._

    These days being generally stormy, our forefathers have endeavoured
to account for this circumstance, by pretending that March _borrowed_
them from April, that he might extend his power so much longer. Those
who are much addicted to superstition will neither borrow nor lend on
any of these days; lest the articles borrowed should be employed for the
purposes of witchcraft, against the lenders. Some of the vulgar imagine,
that these days received their designation from the conduct of the
Israelites in _borrowing_ the property of the Egyptians.

3. In pl. _bosses_, _boisses_, a term of contempt, conjoined with
_auld_, and applied to persons of a despicable or worthless character.

necessary refreshment in sleep, he was wont to do many pieces of
drudgery, S.

  _Douglas._

    Ruddiman seems to think that these spirits were called _Brownies_,
from their supposed "swarthy or tawny colour."  They may be viewed as
corresponding with the _Swartalfar_, i. e. _swarthy_ or _black_ elves of
the Edda, as the _Liosalfar_, or white elves, are analogous to our

_brugg-a_, decoquo cerevisias.  In the ancient Saxon, the termination
_ster_ affixed to a s. masculine, makes it feminine.  Thus, _baecestre_
properly signifies _pistrix_, "a woman-baker." Somn.


_To_ BRUB, _v. a._ To check, to restrain, to keep under, to oppress, to
break one's spirit by severity, S. B.; allied perhaps to A. Bor. _brob_,

Y

Y consonant corresponds to A. S. _G_ before a vowel. This has generally
in S. been printed {~LATIN CAPITAL LETTER EZH~}, from the resemblance of the A. S. letter to the
form of the Roman {~LATIN CAPITAL LETTER EZH~}, although there is not the least affinity as to
power.

This, I apprehend, must be ascribed to the inaccuracy, or to the
ignorance of the writers or copyists of MSS., who, misled by the very
near resemblance of the letters, substituted the long _z_, or {~LATIN CAPITAL LETTER EZH~}, for the
A. S. _g_.

_Father_ of _Yule_.

    Many conjectures have been formed as to the origin of the name. The
most probable are, that it is from Su. G. _j_ demonstrative, like A. S.

TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES

Formatting has been used in order to make each entry easier to read, and
an effort has been made to retain the spirit of the formatting in the
original dictionary. Word sources are given in italics, inset by two
spaces. Etymological information normally appears in a separate line,
inset by four spaces.

All the main entries are capitalised, but sub-entries and
cross-references are in small capitals to distinguish them from the main
entries. This distinction has been retained.

Italics are indicated by _this_ markup.  Small capitals are indicated
by ~this~ markup.

Although the note preceding the entries for the letter 'Y' clearly
describes the letter 'yogh', the character used throughout is {~LATIN CAPITAL LETTER EZH~} (the
'ezh' or 'Latin long z').

Numerous minor errors in punctuation have been silently corrected. There
are also many inconsistencies in punctuation which have been difficult
or impossible to resolve, and many undoubtedly remain. Consistency is
not a feature of this text. This particularly applies to the
etymologies: etymologies are sometimes included with word definitions,
separated by a comma or semi-colon, rather than presented in a separate
paragraph; also although many commas appear to be missing in the
etymologies (especially in the opening sections of the dictionary), none
have been inserted.

Spelling has been left unchanged unless a definite typo has ocurred, as
it probably reflects spelling of the early 19th century.  This includes
variant spellings of the same word.

Hyphens were commoner within compound words than they are today, and
there is also inconsistency in their use throughout this text. There is
also inconsistency in the hyphenation of Latin words, where hyphenation
is sometimes, but not always, used to indicate Latin roots or noun/verb
endings. Hyphens have been retained unless there is a clear indication
that the word should be unhyphenated.

The spelling "Lanerks[hire]" for "Lanarks[hire]" appears to be the
accepted spelling for this period, and therefore has been left
unchanged.

Five instances of _Kings Quair_ have been corrected to _King's
Quair_.

_St_ (no period) _Androis_ is the normal spelling in this text. The
spelling _St. Androis_ appears only once (s.v. INSPRAICH), and has
been left unchanged.

The cited source is often abbreviated, through lack of space: for
example _Doug._ for _Douglas_, _Houl._ for _Houlate_.  These
abbreviations have been left unchanged.

There are also numerous inconsistencies in the abbreviation of recurring
phrases, which have been left unchanged. For example _Palice of
Honour_, _Palice Honour_, _Pal. of Hon._, _Pal. Hon._.

In entries where the numbers "1." "2." "3." &c. are clearly missing,
they have been inserted.

In the original dictionary, capital E acute looks like E{~MODIFIER LETTER ACUTE ACCENT~} e.g. p. 69:
BOUNTE{~MODIFIER LETTER ACUTE ACCENT~}, for BOUNTE. There is also A{~MODIFIER LETTER ACUTE ACCENT~} representing A (in FA{~MODIFIER LETTER ACUTE ACCENT~} and
FORSTA{~MODIFIER LETTER ACUTE ACCENT~}). But this has to be distinguished from such phrases as "A'
the kit" (p. 226) which is an apostrophe indicating missing letters
(usually "ll"): "All the kit".

Only two of the Greek words have accents and breathings. No changes have
been made to the presence or absence of accents in any Greek words.

In the phrase "A bursen belch or bilch" (s.v. BELCH) there is a missing
closing quotation mark. The precise location of the missing mark is
uncertain, and the text has therefore not been changed.

The cross-reference "V. ~Get~" under "GATE, s. Jet." cannot be linked
correctly since the only entry for "GET" has nothing to do with
"Jet".

The cross-reference to "~Skair~" for the word "UNTILL, prep. Unto" may
be an error, as there is no obvious connection with "UNTILL".  However
it is impossible to suggest a logical amendment.

The entry "GRAVIN, GRAWYN, Interred." gives a cross-reference
to "~Graif~" but most of the entry for ~Graif~ is missing.


The following words exist as cross-references but do not appear in the
Dictionary:

Asterne

Bad

Best Aucht

Boytour

Brid

Coles

Doud

Forowth

Hebrun

Hillie-billow

Knacks

Seyne

Talbart

Trentalis

Wayndit

"not understood". There are also several words for which there is no
definition at all (presumably this is accidental).  A list of all

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
