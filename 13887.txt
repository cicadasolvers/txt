INTRODUCTION


This book is written with the object of laying before the public a
cookery book which will be useful not only to vegetarians, but also to
flesh eaters, who are often at a loss for recipes for non-flesh
dishes. Nowadays most people admit that "too much meat is eaten"; but
when the housewife tries to put before her family or friends a meal in
which meat is to be conspicuous by its absence, she is often at a loss
how to set about it.

Vegetarians also frequently stay with non-vegetarian friends, or lodge
with others who do not understand how to provide for them. For such
this book will especially prove useful, for in it will be found a set
of thirty menus, one for each day in a month, giving suitable recipes
with quantities for one person only. Throughout this book it will be
found that the use of wholemeal has been introduced in the place of
white flour. Those persons who do not care to follow the hygienic
principle in its entirety can easily substitute white flour if
preferred. The recipes have been written bearing in mind the necessity
for a wholesome diet; and they will be found to be less rich than
those in most of the cookery books published. Should any one wish to
make the dishes richer, it can easily be done by an addition of
butter, eggs, or cream.

Let me draw the attention of vegetarians to the use of soaked sago in
many dishes. This is a farinaceous food which should be used much more
largely in vegetarian cookery than it is. Thoroughly soaked sago
should be used in all dishes, savouries or sweets, in which a
substitute for suet is required to lighten the mixture; that is, in
boiled savouries or sweets which are largely made of wholemeal, as,
for instance, in vegetable haggis, roly-poly pudding, and all fruit or
vegetable puddings which are boiled in a paste. When soaked sago is
used (taking a teacupful of dry sago to two breakfastcupfuls of meal)
a light paste will be obtained which would mislead any meat eater into
the belief that suet or, at any rate, baking powder had been used.
Baking powder, tartaric acid, soda and bicarbonate of soda, are all
most injurious to the system, and these chemicals have been left out
of this book entirely. In breads and cakes I have used a small
quantity of yeast for the rising of the dough; those who once have got
accustomed to the use of yeast will not find it any more trouble than
using baking powder. It may here be beneficial to give a few hints as
to the harm done by the use of the most commonly introduced chemicals,
namely, soda, bicarbonate of soda, baking powder, tartaric acid, and
citric acid. Not only do they delay the digestion of the foods in
which they are used, and give rise to various stomach troubles, but
also cause rheumatism and gout, and often are the primary cause of
stone in the kidney and bladder. Another danger lies in the fact that
these chemicals are too dear to be supplied pure to the public, which
always demands cheap goods, and the result is that many of the
chemicals in the market are mixed with other still worse poisons, like
arsenic, for instance. Self-raising flour, which is liked by so many
on account of its convenience, is nothing but ordinary flour mixed
with some sort of baking powder; in the same way egg powders are
simply starch powders, coloured and flavoured, mixed with baking
powder. Tartaric acid and citric acid also belong to the class of
injurious chemicals. They are often used in the making of acid drinks,
when lemons are not handy. They irritate the stomach violently, and
often cause acute dyspepsia. These few remarks will, I hope, convince
the readers that all these chemicals are best avoided in culinary
preparations. Even salt and spices are best used in great moderation;
if our dishes could be prepared without them it would be far the best;
but it takes a long time to wean people entirely from the use of
condiments; the first step towards it is to use them as sparingly as
possible.

I have tried to make this a hygienic cookery book; but there are a
number of dishes introduced which can hardly claim to be hygienic; it
has to be left to the good judgment of the readers to use them on rare
occasions only, and it will be better for the health of each
individual if the plainer dishes only are prepared for the daily
table. I wish here to impress on vegetarians, and those who wish to
give the diet a trial, not to eat much pulse; this is the rock on
which many "would-be vegetarians" come to grief. They take these very
concentrated, nitrogenous foods in rather large quantities, because
they have an idea that only they will support them when the use of
meat is abandoned. They are foods which, to be beneficial to the
system of the consumer, require a great deal of muscular exertion on
his part. The results to persons of sedentary habits of eating pulse
foods often are indigestion, heavy and dull feelings, and general
discomfort. In my own household butter beans, the most concentrated
of all foods, come on the table perhaps once a month, lentils or peas
perhaps once a week. None but those persons who have strong digestive
organs should eat pulse foods at all; and then only when they have
plenty of physical work to do. I have known several people who tried
vegetarianism who have given up the trial in despair, and, when I
inquired closely into the causes, the abuse of pulse food was
generally the chief one.

I will now give a list of the composition of the various foods, which
may be instructive and useful to those to whom the study of dietetics
is new, as well as to vegetarians who may wish to use it for
reference. The list is copied from a little pamphlet by A.W. Duncan,
published by the Vegetarian Society in Manchester.

I now leave this book in the hands of the public. I hope that it will
be found useful by many and a help to those who wish to live in a way
which is conducive to health and at the same time innocent of
slaughter and cruelty. The health of the nation to a great extent is
in the hands of our cooks and housewives. If they learn to prepare
wholesome and pure food, those who are dependent on them will benefit
by it. Healthful cookery must result in health to the household and,
therefore, to the nation. Avoid disease-communicating foods, use those
only which are conducive to health, and you will be rewarded by an
increase of health and consequently of happiness.




SOUPS AND STEWS


ARTICHOKE SOUP.

1 lb. each of artichokes and potatoes, 1 Spanish onion, 1 oz. of
butter, 1 pint of milk, and pepper and salt to taste. Peel, wash, and
cut into dice the artichokes, potatoes, and onion. Cook them until
tender in 1 quart of water with the butter and seasoning. When the
vegetables are tender rub them through a sieve. Return the liquid to
the saucepan, add the milk, and boil the soup up again. Add water if
the soup is too thick. Serve with Allinson plain rusks, or small dice
of bread fried crisp in butter or vege-butter.


HARICOT SOUP.

1 lb. of haricot beans, 1/2 lb. of onions, 1 lb. of turnips, 2
carrots, 2 sticks of celery, 1 teaspoonful of mixed herbs, 1/2 oz. of
parsley, 1 oz. of butter, 2 quarts of water, pepper and salt to taste.
Cut up the vegetables and set them to boil in the water with the
haricot beans (which should have been steeped over night in cold
water), adding the butter, herbs, and seasoning. Cook all very gently
for 3-1/2 to 4 hours, stirring occasionally. When the beans are quite
tender, rub the soup through a sieve, adding more water if needed;
return it to the saucepan, add the parsley chopped up finely, boil it
up and serve.


BARLEY SOUP.

8 oz. of pearl barley, 2 onions, 4 potatoes, 1/2 a teaspoonful of
thyme, 1 dessertspoonful of finely chopped parsley, 3-1/2 pints of
water, 1/2 pint of milk, 1 oz. of butter. Pick and wash the barley,
chop up the onions, slice the potatoes. Boil the whole gently for 4
hours with the water, adding the butter, thyme, pepper and salt to
taste. When the barley is quite soft, add the milk and parsley, boil
the soup up, and serve.


BREAD SOUP.

1/2 lb. of stale crusts of Allinson wholemeal bread, 4 onions, 2
turnips, 1 stick of celery, 1 oz. of butter, 1/2 oz. of finely chopped
parsley, 8 pints of water, 1/2 pint of milk. Soak the crusts in the
water for 2 hours before they are put over the fire. Cut up into small
dice the vegetables; add them to the bread with the butter and pepper
and salt to taste. Allow all to simmer gently for 1 hour, then rub the
soup through a sieve, return it to the saucepan, add the milk and
parsley, and, if the flavour is liked, a little grated nutmeg; boil
the soup up and serve at once.


CABBAGE SOUP.

1 fair-sized cabbage, a large Spanish onion, 1-1/2 oz. of butter,
pepper and salt to taste, 1/2 saltspoonful of nutmeg, 1-1/2 pints of
milk, 2 tablespoonfuls of Allinson fine wheatmeal. After preparing and
washing the cabbage, shred up very fine, chop up the onion, set these
two in a saucepan over the fire with 1 quart of water, the butter and
seasoning, and let all cook gently for 1 hour, or longer it the
vegetables are not quite tender. Add the milk and thickening when the
vegetables are thoroughly tender, and let all simmer gently for 10
minutes; serve with little squares of toasted or fried bread, or
Allinson plain rusks.


CABBAGE SOUP (French).

1 medium-sized cabbage, 1 lb. of potatoes, 1 oz. of butter, 3 pints of
milk and water equal parts, pepper and salt to taste, 1
dessertspoonful of finely chopped parsley, and 2 blades of mace, and 1
dessertspoonful of Allinson fine wheatmeal. Wash the cabbage and shred
it finely, peel the potatoes and cut them into small dice; boil the
vegetables in the milk and water until quite tender, adding the mace,
butter, and seasoning. When quite soft, rub the wheatmeal smooth with
a little water, let it simmer with the soup for 5 minutes, add the
parsley, and serve.

MACARONI


Macaroni is one of the most nutritious farinaceous foods. It is made
from Italian wheat, which contains more flesh-forming matter than
butcher's meat. In the manufacture of macaroni some of the bran is
removed from the flour, but the meal left is still very rich in
flesh-forming matter. As the coarser particles of the bran have been
taken away, macaroni is slightly constipating, and must therefore
always be eaten with green vegetables, onions, or fruit. Macaroni
should always be boiled before being made into various dishes. It may
be cooked in plain water, or in milk and water; a little salt may be
added by those who use it, and care should be taken to use just enough
water to cook it in, so that when the macaroni is done, little or no
fluid may be left, but if any does remain it should be saved for
sauce, stock for soup, &c., as it contains valuable nutritive
material. Macaroni takes from 20 minutes to 1 hour to cook, according
to the kind used. That which is slightly yellow is to be preferred to
the white, as the latter is usually poorer than the former in mineral
salts and flesh-forming substances. From 2 to 4 oz. may be regarded as
the amount to be allowed at a meal for grown-up persons.

A very simple nourishing and satisfying meal can be made from macaroni
plainly boiled; it may be eaten with any kind of vegetables, or baked
potatoes, or fried onions, and if desired, with grated cheese, onion,
caper, or parsley sauce.


MACARONI (Italian).

1/2 lb. of spaghetti or vermicelli, 2 oz. of butter, 2 eggs, 3 oz. of
grated cheese, 1 tablespoonful of finely chopped parsley, pepper and
salt to taste. Boil the macaroni till tender in 2 pints of water, to
which the butter has been added. When soft add seasoning, the cheese,
and the parsley. Beat the eggs well in the dish in which the macaroni
is to be served, pour over the mixture of macaroni and other
ingredients, mix all well with the eggs, and serve. If neither
spaghetti nor vermicelli are handy, use Naples macaroni.


MACARONI CHEESE.

1/2 lb. of macaroni, 8 oz. of grated cheese, some breadcrumbs, pepper
and salt to taste, and 1 oz. of butter. Boil the macaroni in slightly
salted water until soft. Then place a layer of it in a pie-dish,
sprinkle some of the grated cheese over it, dust with pepper, and
repeat the layers of macaroni and cheese, finishing with a sprinkling
of cheese, and the breadcrumbs. Cut the butter in pieces, and place
them here and there on the top. Bake it in a moderately hot oven until
brown. Eat with vegetables and tomato sauce. For those who have a weak
digestion plain boiled macaroni with grated cheese added at table is
better and lighter. Macaroni requires from 25 minutes to 1/2 an hour
cooking. The Genoa macaroni takes longer, the thin spaghetti kind is
done in from 15 to 20 minutes, and vermicelli and Italian paste are
done in a few minutes. Macaroni should be thrown into boiling water
and be kept boiling, as the pipes or pieces otherwise stick together.
The Italian paste is mostly used as an addition in clear soup.


MACARONI CREAM.

6 oz. of macaroni, 3 oz. of cheese, 1/2 oz. of butter, 3/4 pint of
milk, 1 teaspoonful of Allinson cornflour, pepper and salt to taste.
Boil the macaroni until tender in only as much water as it will
absorb. Make a sauce of the milk, cornflour, and cheese (you can use
Parmesan, Gruyere, or Canadian cheese). Place the macaroni in a
pie-dish, pour the sauce over it, grate some more cheese over the top,
and let the macaroni brown in the oven.


MACARONI SAVOURY.

4 oz. of boiled macaroni, 4 oz. of Allinson fine wheatmeal, 3 eggs,
3/4 pint of milk, 1 finely chopped onion, the grated rind of 1 lemon,
2 oz. of grated cheese, 1 tablespoonful of finely chopped parsley, 1
oz. of butter, 1/2 a saltspoonful of grated nutmeg, pepper and salt to
taste. Cut the macaroni in small pieces. Make a batter of the milk,
eggs, and meal, mix into it all the other ingredients, pour it into a
buttered pie-dish, cut up the butter in pieces and spread them on the
top. Bake the savoury for 1 to 1-1/2 hours.




RICE


In many households it seems a difficulty to get rice cooked properly,
that is having all the grains separate. Very often it comes to table
in a soft, pulpy mass, which is certainly not appetising. To cook it
in a large saucepanful of water which is then drained away is very
wasteful, for a great deal of the goodness of the rice is thrown away.
The following recipe will be found thoroughly reliable and
satisfactory.


RICE, HOW TO COOK.

1 lb. of good rice, 1 quart of water, 1 oz. of butter, salt to taste.
Wash the rice and set it over the fire with 1 quart of cold water, the
butter and salt. Let it come to the boil gently, stirring it a little
to prevent the rice from sticking to the saucepan. When the rice
boils, set it on the side and let it just simmer. It will be
sufficiently cooked in 15 to 20 minutes and each grain will be
separate. Rice should not be cooked too soft, only just cooked
through.


CURRIED RICE.

1 lb. of Patna rice, 1 quart of cold water, 1 dessertspoonful of
curry, 1 oz. of butter, and salt to taste. Wash the rice, mix the
curry with the proper quantity of water, and set the rice over the
fire with it, adding the butter and seasoning. Let the rice come to
the boil slowly, and stir it a few times to prevent it sticking to the
saucepan. When the rice boils, cover it with a piece of buttered
paper, and let it cook very gently, not stirring it again. When all
the water is absorbed, serve the rice. Do not allow it to get very
soft; the rice will take from 15 to 20 minutes' cooking only.


CURRIED RICE AND TOMATOES.

1/2 lb. of Patna rice, 1 dessertspoonful of curry powder, salt to
taste, and 1 oz. of butter. Wash the rice; mix 1 pint of cold water
with the curry powder, put this over the fire with the rice, butter,
and salt. Cover the rice with a piece of buttered paper and let it
simmer gently until the water is absorbed. This will take about 20
minutes. Rice cooked this way will have all the grains separate. For
the tomatoes proceed as follows: 1 lb. of tomatoes and a little
butter, pepper and salt. Wash the tomatoes and place them in a flat
tin with a few spoonfuls of water; dust them with pepper and salt, and
place little bits of butter on each tomato. Bake them from 15 to 20
minutes, according to the size of the tomatoes and the heat of the
oven. Place the rice in the centre of a hot flat dish, put the
tomatoes round it, pour the liquid over the rice, and serve.


PORTUGUESE RICE.

1 teacupful of rice, 3 medium-sized onions, 3 tomatoes, 2 oz. of
grated cheese, 1/2 teaspoonful of herbs, 1 oz. of butter, pepper and
salt to taste. Peel and slice the onions and tomatoes and fry them in
the butter for 15 minutes; place the rice over the fire with 1 pint of
water; add the onions, tomatoes, herbs, and seasoning, and let all
cook until the rice is quite soft; serve in a vegetable dish with the
grated cheese sprinkled over.


RICE AND LENTILS.

Boil the rice as above; stew Egyptian lentils with chopped onions,
pepper, salt, and a little butter, until well done. Put the rice on a
dish, pour over the stewed onions and lentils, serve, and eat with
green vegetables.


RICE AND ONIONS.

Boil whole onions in water until done quite through, remove them from
the water, and put in it washed rice with a little pepper, salt, and
butter. When done, serve with the onions and eat with a green
vegetable.


SAVOURY RICE (Italian).

1 breakfastcupful of rice, 4 tablespoonfuls of grated cheese (Parmesan
or other cheese), 1 oz. of butter, a pinch of saffron, pepper and salt
to taste. Boil the rice with water as above, then add the cheese,
butter, saffron, and seasoning; mix all well, and serve.


SAVOURY RICE CROQUETTES.

1/2 lb. of Patna rice, 1-1/2 pints of milk, 1 lb. of Spanish onions, 1
oz. of butter, 2 eggs, 1 teacupful of raspings, Allinson's oil for
frying. Boil the rice in the milk until soft, and turn it out to get
quite cold. Meanwhile chop the onions up fine and fry them brown in
the butter. Form the cold rice into balls, and with the thumb of the
right hand hollow them sufficiently to admit of their receiving a
stuffing of fried onions, close them again carefully, dip them in the
eggs beaten up and then in the raspings, and fry them in boiling oil a
light brown. Serve with gravy. There are various stuffings which can
be used instead of the onions--fried mushrooms chopped up, some olives
chopped fine and mixed with hard-boiled yolks of eggs, &c.


SPANISH RICE.

6 onions, 6 tomatoes, 1-1/2 pints of vegetable stock, herbs and
seasoning, 1-1/2 cupfuls of rice, butter. Fry the onions and tomatoes
in butter until well browned, then place them with the seasoning into
the cold stock, and add the rice. When all have boiled slowly for 20
minutes, the rice should have absorbed the stock. Serve with cheese
grated over.

beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, and mix them lightly
with the other ingredients. Meanwhile beat the butter in the omelet
pan; when boiling pour the mixture into it, and fry the omelet over a
gentle fire. When it begins to set round the sides shake it very
gently from side to side, and turn the omelet neatly out on a buttered
dish. Set it in the oven for about 10 minutes, and serve immediately
with a little castor sugar sifted over it.


OMELET TOMATO (1).

This is made in almost the same way as the savoury omelet, but without
the addition of flavouring herbs. 2 average-sized tomatoes are cut up
fine, and mixed with the ingredients given above. When tinned tomatoes
are used the juice may be made hot and the bread soaked in it instead
of in milk and water.


OMELET TOMATO (2).

1 lb. of tomatoes, 1/2 lb. of breadcrumbs, 1 large Spanish onion, 3
eggs, 2 oz. of butter, pepper and salt to taste. Stew the finely
chopped onions in the butter for 20 minutes in a covered-up saucepan,
add pepper and salt, cut the tomatoes up, add these to the other
ingredients. Let all simmer for 20 minutes; pour the mixture over the
breadcrumbs, add the eggs well beaten, mix all up thoroughly, and turn
the mixture into one or more well-buttered shallow tins. Bake the
omelet in a quick oven for 10 to 15 minutes.


OMELET TRAPPIST.

4 oz. of fine breadcrumbs, 2 eggs, 1-1/2 oz. of butter, 1/2
teaspoonful of powdered herbs, pepper and salt to taste, 1/2 gill of
boiling milk. Moisten the breadcrumbs with the milk, add the eggs well
beaten, the herbs and seasoning. Mix all well and smoothly. Melt the
butter in the frying-pan, spread the mixture in it, and fry the omelet
a golden brown both sides.


SWEET OMELET (1).

3 eggs, 2 oz. of butter, sugar to taste, 1 lemon, and 1/2 a teacupful
of new milk. Whip the yolks of the eggs well, adding the grated rind
of the lemon, half the butter melted, the milk, and sugar. Just before
frying the omelet, add the lemon juice and the whites of the eggs
whipped to a stiff froth. Make the rest of the butter boiling hot in
an oval omelet pan, the size of the dish on which it is to be served,
and fry till lightly browned. Sift sugar over it, and serve
immediately.


SWEET OMELET (2).

1/2 pint of new milk, 4 eggs, cinnamon and sugar to taste, 1 oz. of
butter, and 1 teaspoonful of Allinson fine wheatmeal. Smooth the
wheatmeal with the milk, and mix with the other ingredients. Make the
butter boiling hot in a frying-pan, and fry the omelet till lightly
browned. Serve immediately with sugar sifted over it.


SWEET OMELET (3).

5 eggs, 1 tablespoonful of castor sugar, 2 tablespoonfuls of water, 2
oz. of butter, some raspberry and currant jam. Melt the butter in an
omelet pan, beat the eggs well, stir in the sugar, and pour the
mixture into the hot butter. Fry a pale golden colour, and turn it on
to a hot dish. Spread some jam on the omelet, double it, and serve at
once. The inside of the omelet should remain creamy.




VEGETABLES


GREEN VEGETABLES (General Remarks).

I have not given recipes for the cooking of plain greens, as they are
prepared very much alike everywhere in England. There are a number of
recipes in this book giving savoury ways of preparing them, and I will
now make a few remarks on the cooking of plain vegetables. The English
way of boiling them is not at all a good one, as most of the soluble
vegetable salts, which are so important to our system, are lost
through it. Green vegetables are generally boiled in a great deal of
salt water; this is drained off when they are tender, and the
vegetables then served. A much better way for all vegetables is to
cook them in a very small quantity of water, and adding a small piece
of butter (1 oz. to 2 lb. of greens) and a little salt. When the
greens are tender, any water which is not absorbed should be thickened
with a little Allinson fine wheatmeal and eaten with the vegetables. A
great number of them, such as _Cabbages, Savoys, Brussel sprouts,
Scotch kail, turnip-tops, &c., &c._, can be prepared this way.

In the case of vegetables like _asparagus, cauliflower, sea kale,
parsnips, artichokes, carrots_ or _celery_, which cannot always be
stewed in a little water, this should be saved as stock for soups or
sauces. Most of these vegetables are very nice with a white sauce;
carrots are particularly pleasant with parsley sauce.

_Spinach_ is a vegetable which English cooks rarely prepare nicely;
the Continental way of preparing it is as follows: The spinach is
cooked without water, with a little salt; when quite tender it is
strained, turned on to a board, and chopped very finely; then it is
returned to the saucepan with a piece of butter, a little nutmeg, or a
few very finely chopped eschalots and some of the juice previously
strained. When the spinach is cooking a little Allinson fine
wheatmeal, smoothed in 1 or 2 tablespoonfuls of milk, is added to bind
the spinach with the juice; cook it a few minutes longer, and serve it
with slices of hard-boiled egg on the top. _Potatoes_ also require a
good deal of care. When peeled, potatoes are plainly boiled, they
should be placed over the fire after the water has been strained; the
potatoes should be lightly shaken to allow the moisture to steam out.
This makes them mealy and more palatable. Potatoes which have been
baked in their skins should be pricked when tender, or the skins be
cracked in some way, otherwise they very soon become sodden. A very
palatable way of serving potatoes, is to peel them and bake them in a
tin with a little oil or butter, or vege-butter; they should be turned
occasionally, in order that they should brown evenly. This is not a
very hygienic way of preparing potatoes. From a health point of view
they are best baked in their skins, or steamed with or without the
skins. A good many vegetables may be steamed with advantage; for
instance, _cabbage, sprouts, turnips, parsnips, swedes, Scotch kail,
&c._ Any way of preparing greens is better than boiling them in a
large saucepanful of water and throwing this away. I may just mention
that Scotch kail, after being boiled in a little water, should be
treated exactly as spinach, and is most delicious in that way; an
onion cooked with it greatly improves the flavour.


ARTICHOKES A LA SAUCE BLANCHE.

2 lbs. of artichokes, 1 oz. of Allinson fine wheatmeal, 3/4 pint of
milk, 1 egg, juice of 1/2 a lemon, pepper and salt to taste. Peel the
artichokes, and boil them in water until tender; cut them into slices
1/2 an inch thick and place them on a dish. Make a sauce of the milk
and meal with seasoning; when the sauce has thickened, remove it from
the fire, beat up the egg with the lemon juice and add both to the
sauce, pour it over the artichokes, and serve.


ARTICHOKES A LA PARMESAN.

2 lbs. of artichokes, 3/4 pint of milk, 1 tablespoonful of Allinson
fine wheatmeal, 1 egg, juice of 1/2 a lemon, 2 oz. of grated Parmesan
or any other cooking cheese. Proceed as in the recipe for "Celery a la
Parmesan," add the cheese to the sauce, and serve the same with sauce
as above.


ASPARAGUS (BOILED).

Scrape the white parts of the stalks quite clean, and put them into
cold water as they are done. Tie them up into bundles, and cut them
all the same length. Now put them into a saucepan, cover with boiling
water, add a little salt, and boil gently and steadily for 20 to 30
minutes. Take them out of the water as soon as they are tender, and
dish on to rounds of toast with the points to the middle. Serve with
them rich melted butter in a tureen.


CABBAGE.

Remove the outer coarse leaves, cut the cabbage in four pieces
lengthways, and well wash the pieces in salt water. The salt is added
because it kills any insects which may be present. Wash the cabbage as
often as is necessary in pure water after this to clean it and remove
the salt, and then shred it up fine. Set it over the fire with 1/2
pint of water, 1 oz. of butter, a dash of pepper, and a very little
salt. Let it cook very gently for 2 hours; when it is quite tender,
the liquid can be thickened with a little fine wheatmeal; smooth this
with a little milk, or water if milk is not handy; boil it up, and
serve.


CARROTS WITH PARSLEY SAUCE.

Scrub and wash as many carrots as are required. Cook them in a little
water or steam them until quite tender, then slice them and place them
in a saucepan. Make a white sauce as directed in the recipe for
"Onions and white sauce," and stir into it a handful of finely-chopped
parsley. Pour the sauce over the carrots, and let them simmer for ten
minutes. Serve very hot with baked potatoes.


CAULIFLOWER WITH WHITE SAUCE.

Trim the cauliflower, cutting away only the bad and bruised leaves and
the coarse part of the stalk. Put it into salt water to force out any
insects in the cauliflower. After soaking, wash it well in fresh water
and boil quickly until tender, and serve with white sauce.


CELERY (ITALIAN).

2 heads of celery, 1/2 pint of milk, 1 oz. of butter, 1 egg, 1 cupful
of breadcrumbs, pepper and salt to taste. Cut up the celery into
pieces, boil it in water for 10 minutes; drain it and put it into the
stewpan with the milk, 1/2 oz. butter, pepper and salt. Simmer the
celery gently until tender, put it aside to cool a little, and add the
egg well beaten. Butter a shallow dish, strew it well with some of the
breadcrumbs, and pour in the celery, sprinkle the rest of the
breadcrumbs over the top, put the butter over it in little bits, and
bake the celery until brown.


CELERY (STEAMED) WITH WHITE CHEESE SAUCE.

Prepare the celery as in previous recipe, leaving it in long pieces,
and place it in a vegetable steamer, which consists of a large
saucepan over which is fitted a perforated top. Add a little pepper
and salt, and let the celery steam for 1-1/2 hours. For the sauce you
need: 1 pint of milk, 1 oz. of butter, 1 dessertspoonful of Allinson
cornflour, 1-1/2 oz. of grated cheese, pepper and salt to taste. Boil
the milk with the butter, thicken it with the cornflour smoothed first
with a spoonful of water, and last add the grated cheese and
seasoning; let the sauce simmer, stirring it until the cheese is
dissolved. Have ready some Allinson plain rusks on a flat dish, place
the celery on it, pour the sauce over, and serve very hot.


CELERY (STEWED) WITH WHITE SAUCE.

2 or 3 heads of celery (according to quantity required), 2 oz. of
butter, 1 dessertspoonful of flour, 1/2 pint of milk, pepper and salt
to taste. Remove the outer hard pieces from the celery, saving them
for flavouring soups or sauces; wash well and cut up in pieces about 3
inches long. Set over the fire with 1/2 pint of water, the butter and
seasoning. Let cook gently until the celery is quite tender, which
will take about 1 hour; add the thickening and the milk. Let all
gently simmer for a few minutes, and serve.


LEEKS.

Remove the coarse part of the green stalks of the leeks. If the leeks
are gritty cut them right through and wash them well, and if necessary
use a brush to get out the sand. Tie the leeks in bunches and steam
them until tender, which will take about 1-1/2 hours. Make a white
sauce as for the cauliflower. Put the leeks on pieces of dry toast on
a flat dish, pour the sauce over them, and serve.


MUSHROOMS (STEWED).

1 lb. of mushrooms, 1 oz. of butter, 1/2 pint of water, 1/2
teaspoonful of herbs, 1/2 saltspoonful of nutmeg, pepper and salt to
taste, juice of 1/2 a lemon, the yolk of 1 egg, 1 dessertspoonful of
Allinson cornflour. Peel and clean the mushrooms, and wash them in
water with a dash of vinegar in it. Wipe them dry with a cloth; have
the water and butter ready in a saucepan with the herbs, and
seasoning. Stew the mushrooms in this for 10 to 15 minutes. Thicken
with the cornflour, then stir in the yolk of egg with the lemon juice,
and serve.


ONION TORTILLA.

1 lb. of Spanish onions, 1-1/2 oz. of butter or oil, 3 eggs. Melt the
butter in a frying-pan, slice the onions, and fry them for 10 or 15
minutes, beat the eggs, add them to the onions, season with pepper and
salt, and fry the whole a light brown on both sides.


ONIONS (BRAISED).

2 lbs. of onions, 2 oz. of butter, vege-butter, or oil, pepper and
salt to taste. Peel and slice the onions, and fry them a nice brown in
the butter. Then add enough water to make gravy, add pepper and salt,
and stew the onions for 20 minutes. Eat with wholemeal toast. This is
very savoury, and is much liked.


ONIONS (SPANISH) (BAKED).

Peel as many onions as are required, making an incision crossways on
the top, and put in a baking-dish with 1/2 oz. of butter on each large
onion, or half that quantity on small ones; dust them over with pepper
and salt, and bake them for 3 hours. Keep them covered for 2 hours,
and let them brown after that. Baste the onions from time to time with
the butter.


SCOTCH OR CURLY KAIL.

Scotch kail is best after there has been frost on it. Wash the kail,
and cut away the coarse stalks, boil it for 1-1/2 to 2 hours in a
small quantity of water, adding a chopped up onion. Drain it when soft
and chop it fine like spinach. Into the saucepan in which the kail was
cooked put a piece of butter; melt it, and stir into it 1
tablespoonful of Allinson fine wheatmeal, and brown it very slightly.
Then add some of the drained-off kail wafer and stir it smooth with
the browned flour. Return the chopped Scotch kail to the saucepan, add
pepper and salt to taste; let it cook for a minute, and serve.


SPINACH.

Wash the spinach thoroughly, and set it over the fire in a saucepan
without any water, as enough water will boil out of the spinach to
cook it. Heat it gently at first, stirring it a few times to prevent
it burning, until enough water has boiled out of the spinach to
prevent it from catching. Let the spinach cook 20 minutes, then strain
it through a colander, pressing the water out with a wooden spoon or
plate. Put a piece of butter in the saucepan in which the spinach was
cooked; when melted, stir into it a spoonful of Allinson fine
wheatmeal, and keep stirring the meal and butter for 1 minute over the
fire. Return the spinach to the saucepan, mix it well with the butter
and meal, and add as much of the strained-off water as is necessary to
moisten it; add pepper and salt to taste, and a little lemon juice.
Let the spinach heat well through before serving. Have ready 1 or 2
hard-boiled eggs cut in slices, and decorate the spinach with them.
Use 1 oz. of butter, an even tablespoonful of the meal, and the juice
of 1/2 a lemon to 4 lbs. of spinach.


TURNIPS (MASHED).

Peel and wash the turnips, and steam them until tender. Mash them up
in a saucepan over the fire, mixing with them 1 oz. of butter. Pile
the mashed turnips on a flat dish, and pour a white sauce over them.




EGG COOKERY.


Eggs are a boon to cooks, especially when dishes are wanted quickly.
They enter into a great many savoury and sweet dishes, and few cakes
are made without them. They can be prepared in a great variety of
ways. Eggs are a good food when taken in moderation. As they are a
highly nutritious article of food, they should not be indulged in too
freely. Eggs contain both muscle and bone-forming material, in fact
everything required for building up the organism of the young bird.
The chemical composition of hen's and duck's eggs are as follows:--

                Hen's egg. Duck's egg.
  Water ........   74.22    71.11
  Nitrogen .....   12.55    12.24
  Fat ..........   12.11    15.49
  Mineral matter    1.12     1.16
                  ------   ------
                  100.00   100.00


Eggs take a long time to digest if hard boiled. All the fat of the egg
is contained in the yolk, but the white of the egg is pure albumen (or
nitrogen) and water. Eggs are most easily digested raw or very lightly
boiled, and best cooked thus for invalids. The best way of lightly
boiling an egg is to put it in boiling water, set the basin or
saucepan on the side of the stove, and let it stand just off the boil
for five or six minutes. Eggs often crack when they are put into
enough boiling water to well cover them, owing to the sudden expansion
of the contents. If they are not covered with water there is less
danger of them cracking. One can easily tell stale eggs from fresh
ones by holding them up to a strong light. A fresh egg looks clear and
transparent, whilst stale ones look cloudy and opaque. There are
various ways of preserving eggs for the winter; one of the best is by
using the Allinson egg preservative. Another very good way is to have
stands made with holes which will hold the eggs. Keep these stands in
an airy place in a good current of fresh air, and every week turn the
eggs, so that one week they stand the pointed end down, next week the
rounded end down.


APPLE SOUFFLE.

4 eggs, 4 apples, 2 oz. of castor sugar (or more if the apples are
very sour), 1 gill of new milk or half milk and half cream, 1 oz. of
Allinson cornflour, and the juice of 1 lemon. Pare, cut up, and stew
the apples with the sugar and lemon juice until they are reduced to a
pulp. Beat them quite smooth, and return them to the stewpan. Smooth
the cornflour with the milk, and mix it with the apples, and stir
until it boils; then turn the mixture into a basin to cool. Separate
the yolks from the whites of the eggs; beat the yolks well, and mix
them with the apple mixture. Whisk the whites to a stiff froth, mix
them lightly with the rest, and pour the whole into a buttered souffle
tin. Bake for 20 minutes in a moderately hot oven, and serve at once.


CHEESE SOUFFLE.

8 oz. of Parmesan or other good dry, cooking cheese, 4 eggs, 1 oz. of
Allinson fine wheatmeal, 1 gill of milk, 1 oz. of butter, mustard,
pepper, and salt to taste. Melt the butter in a saucepan, stir in the
wheatmeal, season with mustard, pepper, and salt. Pour in the milk,
and stir until the mixture is set and comes away from the sides of the
saucepan. Turn into a basin, and let the mixture cool. Grate the
cheese and stir it in; separate the yolks of the eggs from the whites,
and drop the yolks of the eggs, one by one, into the mixture, beating
all well. Whip the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, mix it
lightly with the other ingredients; turn the mixture into a buttered
souffle tin, and bake the souffle for 15 minutes.


CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE.

5 eggs, 2 oz. of butter, 3 oz. of castor sugar, 2 large bars of
chocolate, 6 oz. of the crumb of the bread, and vanilla essence to
taste. Cream the butter, and stir into it gradually the yolks of the
eggs, the sugar, and chocolate. Previously soak the bread in milk or
water. Squeeze it dry, and add to it the other ingredients. Add
vanilla and the whites of the eggs whipped to a stiff froth, and pour
the mixture into a buttered pie-dish or cake tin. Bake 3/4 of an hour,
and serve immediately. If the souffle is baked in a cake tin, a
serviette should be pinned round it before serving.


CURRIED EGGS.

6 hard-boiled eggs, 1 medium-sized English onion, 1 cooking apple, 1
teaspoonful of curry powder, 1 dessertspoonful of Allinson fine
wheatmeal, 1 oz. of butter, and salt to taste. Prepare the onion and
apple, chop them very fine, and fry them in the butter in a stewpan
until brown. Add 1/2 pint of water and a little salt. Smooth the curry
and wheatmeal with a little cold water, and thicken the sauce with it.
Let it simmer for 10 minutes, then rub through a sieve. Return the
sauce to the stewpan, shell the eggs, and heat them up in the sauce;
serve very hot on a flat dish.


EGG AND CHEESE.

6 eggs, 1 teacupful of milk, thickened with 1 dessertspoonful of
Allinson fine wheatmeal, 2 oz. of grated cheese, pepper and salt to
taste. Butter a pie-dish, pour into it the thickened milk, break the
eggs over it, sprinkle the cheese over them, and season to taste. Bake
in a moderate oven until the eggs are just set.


EGG AND CHEESE FONDU.

To each egg 1/2 its weight in grated cheese and a 1/2 oz. of butter
(if only 1 egg is prepared 1/2 oz. of butter must be used); mustard,
pepper, and salt to taste. Whip up the eggs, add 1 dessertspoonful of
water for each egg, as in the previous recipe; mix in the cheese, a
little made mustard, and pepper and salt. Heat the butter in a
frying-pan or small stewpan. When hot stir in the mixture of egg and
cheese. Keep stirring it with a knife, until it becomes a smooth and
thickish mass. Put on hot buttered toast, and serve. This is an
extremely tasty French dish. The mixture, when cold, is excellent for
sandwiches.


EGG AND TOMATO SAUCE.

4 eggs, 1 teacupful of tomato sauce, and 1/2 oz. of butter. Melt the
butter in a flat dish; break the eggs carefully into it without
breaking the yolks, and place the dish on the stove until the eggs are
set. Heat the tomato sauce, which should be well seasoned, and pour it
over the eggs. Serve very hot, with sippets of Allinson wholemeal
toast.


EGG AND TOMATO SANDWICHES.

4 eggs, 1 teacupful of tinned tomatoes or 1/2 lb. fresh ones, pepper
and salt, 1 oz. of butter. Melt the butter in a frying-pan, and cook
the tomatoes in it until most of the liquid is steamed away; set aside
to cool. If fresh tomatoes are used, they should be scalded and
skinned before cooking. Beat up the eggs and stir them into the cooled
tomatoes, adding seasoning to taste. Stir the eggs and tomatoes with a
knife until set, then turn the mixture into a bowl to get cold, and
use for sandwiches.


EGG SALAD WITH MAYONNAISE.

1 lb. of cold boiled potatoes, 6 hard-boiled eggs, the juice of 1/2 a
lemon, pepper and salt to taste. Cut the potatoes and eggs into
slices, dust them with pepper and salt, add the lemon juice, and mix
all well together. Make the mayonnaise as follows; 1-1/2 gills of good
salad oil, the yolks of 2 eggs, 1 saltspoonful of mustard, lemon
juice, pepper, and salt to taste. Take a clean cold basin, and place
in it the yolks of the eggs beaten up. Drop the oil into them, drop by
drop, stirring with a wooden spoon quickly all the time. Great care
should be taken, especially in the beginning, as the eggs easily
curdle when the oil is stirred in too fast. When the mayonnaise gets
very thick add carefully a little lemon juice to thin it down, then
add again oil and lemon juice alternately until all the oil is used
up. Smooth the mustard with a little lemon juice, and stir it in last
of all with sufficient pepper and salt. Taste the mayonnaise, and add
lemon juice or seasoning as required. Vinegar may be used instead of
lemon juice if the latter is not conveniently had. The mayonnaise
should be made in a cold room, as it may curdle if made in a hot room.
Should an accident happen, beat up another yolk of egg and start
afresh with a little fresh oil, and when going on well stir in, drop
by drop, the curdled mayonnaise. Mix part of it with the eggs and
potatoes, and pour the rest over the salad; garnish with watercress.


EGG SALMAGUNDI WITH JAM.

4 eggs, 1 oz. of butter, the juice of 1/2 a lemon, 1/2 a teacupful of
cream or milk, some apricot or other jam. Melt the butter in a
frying-pan. Beat the eggs, and mix with them the cream or milk and the
lemon juice. Pour the mixture into the butter, and stir it over the
fire until it thickens. Stir in some jam, and serve with lady fingers,
Allinson rusks, or bread fried in butter.


EGG SAVOURY.

6 hard-boiled eggs, shelled and sliced; in summer use 1 large
breakfastcupful of boiled and chopped spinach; in winter Scotch kale
prepared the same way; some very thin slices of bread and butter,
nutmeg, pepper, and salt to taste, 1/2 pint of milk, and some butter.
Butter a pie-dish and line it with slices of bread and butter. Spread
a layer of spinach and a layer of slices of eggs; dust with nutmeg,
pepper, and salt. Repeat the layers, and finish with a layer of bread
well buttered. Pour over the whole the milk, and bake the savoury from
20 to 30 minutes, or until brown.


EGGS A LA BONNE FEMME.

4 eggs, 1 Spanish onion, 1 oz. of butter, 1 teaspoonful of vinegar,
and 2 tablespoonfuls of breadcrumbs; pepper and salt to taste. Peel
and slice the onion, and fry it brown in the butter; add the vinegar
and seasoning when done. Spread the onion on a buttered dish, break
the eggs over them, dust these with pepper and salt, and sprinkle with
breadcrumbs. Place a few bits of butter on the top, and bake until the
eggs are set, which will only take a few minutes.


EGGS A LA DUCHESSE.

1 quart of milk, 6 eggs, 1 tablespoonful of Allinson cornflour, sugar
to taste, a piece of vanilla 2 inches long. Splice the vanilla and let
it boil with the milk and sugar; smooth the cornflour with a spoonful
of water, thicken the milk with it, and let it cook gently for 2 or 3
minutes; remove the vanilla. Have ready the whites of eggs whipped to
a stiff froth, drop it in spoonfuls in the boiling milk; let it simmer
for a few minutes until the egg snow has got set, remove the snowballs
with a slice, and place them in a glass dish. Let the milk cool a
little; beat up the yolks of the eggs, mix them carefully with the
milk, taking care not to curdle them; stir the whole over the fire to
let the eggs thicken, but do not allow it to boil. Let the mixture
cool, pour the custard into the glass dish, but not pouring it over
the snow; serve when quite cold. Half the quantity will make a fair
dishful.


EGGS AND CABBAGE.

1 large breakfastcupful of cold boiled cabbage, 3 eggs, 1 teacupful of
milk, pepper and salt to taste, 1/2 oz. of butter. Warm the cabbage
with the butter and the milk; meanwhile beat up the eggs. Mix all
together and season with pepper and salt. Turn the mixture into a
shallow buttered pie-dish, and bake for 20 minutes. Any kind of cold
vegetables mashed up can be used up this way, and will make a nice
side dish for dinner.


EGGS AU GRATIN.

3 hard-boiled eggs, 1-1/2 oz. of grated cheese, 1 oz. of butter, 2
tablespoonfuls of breadcrumbs, a little nutmeg, and pepper and salt to
taste. Slice the eggs, place them on a well-buttered flat baking dish,
sprinkle them thickly with the grated cheese, and dust with nutmeg,
pepper, and salt. Spread the breadcrumbs over the top, and scatter the
butter in bits over the breadcrumbs. Bake until the breadcrumbs begin
to brown.


FORCEMEAT EGGS.

6 eggs, 1 small English onion, a few leaves of fresh sage, or 1/2
teaspoonful of dried powdered sage, a few sprigs of Parsley, pepper
and salt to taste, and some paste rolled thin, made of 6 oz. of
Allinson fine wheatmeal, 2 oz. of butter or vege-butter, and a little
cold water. Boil the eggs for 10 minutes, set them in cold water, and
take off the shells. Cut them in half lengthways, remove the yolks,
and proceed as follows: Chop up the onion very fine with the sage and
parsley, and season with pepper and salt. Pound the yolks very fine,
and add the onion and herbs; fill the whites of the eggs with the
mixture. Put the halves together, enclose them in paste, brush them
over with the white of egg, and bake until the pastry is done, which
will take about 15 minutes. Serve with vegetables and sauce.


FRENCH EGGS.

6 hard-boiled eggs, 1/2 pint of milk, 1 oz. of butter, 1
dessertspoonful of Allinson fine wheatmeal, 1 dessertspoonful of
finely chopped parsley, nutmeg, pepper, and salt to taste. Boil the
milk with the butter, thicken it with the flour, smoothed previously
with a little cold milk; season to taste. When the milk is thickened
shell the eggs, cut them into quarters lengthways, and put them into
the sauce. Last of all, put in the parsley, and serve with sippets of
toast laid in the bottom of the dish.


MUSHROOM AND EGGS.

4 hard-boiled eggs, 1/4 lb. of mushrooms, 1 teaspoonful of parsley
chopped very fine, 1 oz. of butter, pepper and salt. Stew the
mushrooms in the butter, and season well; chop up the eggs and mix
them with the mushrooms, adding the parsley; heat all well through,
and serve on sippets of toast.


MUSHROOM SOUFFLE.

4 eggs, 1 oz. of Allinson fine wheatmeal, 1 oz. of butter, 6 oz. of
mushrooms, pepper and salt to taste. Peel, wash, and cut in small
pieces the mushrooms, and stew them in 3/4 of a teacupful of water.
When the mushrooms have stewed 10 minutes, drain off the liquid, which
should be a teacupful. Melt the butter in a little saucepan, stir into
it the wheatmeal, and when this is well mixed with the butter, add the
mushroom liquor, stirring the mixture well until quite smooth and
thick and coming away from the sides of the saucepan. Then stir in the
mushrooms, and turn all into a basin and let it cool a little.
Separate the yolks from the whites of the eggs, and stir each yolk
separately into the mixture in the basin. Season to taste. Whip up the
whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, and mix them lightly with the
rest. Turn the mixture into a buttered pie-dish or souffle tin, and
bake the souffle 15 minutes.


POACHED EGGS.

Unless an egg-poacher is used, eggs are best poached in a large
frying-pan nearly filled with water. A little vinegar and salt should
be added to the water, as the eggs will then set more quickly. Each
egg should first be broken into a separate cup, and then slipped into
the rapidly boiling water; cover them up and allow them to boil only
just long enough to have the whites set, which will take about 2
minutes. Quite newly laid eggs take a little longer. Have ready hot
buttered toast, remove the eggs from the water with an egg-slice, and
slip them on the toast. Always have plates and dishes very hot for all
kinds of egg dishes. Poached eggs are also a very nice accompaniment
to vegetables, like spinach, Scotch kale, &c., when they are served
laid on the vegetables.


POTATO SOUFFLE.

2 oz. of butter, 4 eggs, 1/4 lb. of castor sugar, 1/2 oz. of ground
almonds (half bitter and half sweet), 6 oz. of cold boiled and grated
potatoes, and 1-1/2 oz. of sifted breadcrumbs. Cream the butter in a
basin, which is done by stirring it round the sides of the basin until
soft and creamy, when it will make a slight crackling noise. Stir in
the yolks of the eggs, the sugar, and almonds; beat for 10 minutes,
then stir in the potatoes and breadcrumbs, and last of all the whites
of the eggs whipped to a stiff froth. Turn the mixture into a
well-buttered dish, and bake in a moderately hot oven from 3/4 of an
hour to 1 hour.


RATAFIA SOUFFLE.

6 eggs, 2 oz. of Allinson fine wheatmeal, 2 oz. of butter, 2 oz. of
castor sugar, the grated rind of 1/2 lemon, 1/2 pint of milk, 3 oz. of
ratafias. Melt the butter in a saucepan, stir in the flour, mix well,
and then add the milk, stirring all until the mixture is quite smooth
and thick and comes away from the sides of the saucepan. Let it cool a
little, then stir in the yolks of the eggs well beaten, the lemon
rind, the sugar, and lastly, the whites of the eggs whipped to a stiff
froth. Turn the mixture into a buttered pie-dish or cake tin, with
alternate layers of ratafias. Bake from 1/2 an hour to 3/4 of an hour
in a moderately hot oven, and serve immediately with stewed fruit.


RICE SOUFFLE.

6 eggs, 2 oz. of rice, 1 pint of milk, sugar to taste, vanilla essence
or the peel of 1/2 a lemon, and 1 oz. of butter. Stew the rice in the
milk with the butter, sugar, and the lemon peel, if the latter is used
for flavouring. When the rice is tender remove the peel; or flavour
with vanilla essence, and let all cool. Separate the yolks of the eggs
from the whites, and beat each separately into the rice for 2 or 3
minutes. Whip the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, and stir them
lightly into the mixture. Have ready a buttered souffle tin, pour the
mixture into it, and bake the souffle for 20 minutes in a hot oven.
Sprinkle with castor sugar, and serve at once.

hot.


STIRRED EGGS ON TOAST.

4 eggs, 1 oz. of butter, pepper and salt, 3 slices of hot buttered
toast. Whip the eggs up well, add a dessertspoonful of water for each
egg, and pepper and salt to taste. Heat the butter in a frying-pan,
stir in the eggs over a mild fire. Keep stirring the mixture with a
knife, removing the egg which sets round the sides and on the bottom
of the frying-pan, and take the mixture from the fire directly it gets
uniformly thick. It should not be allowed to cook until hard. Place
the stirred eggs on the toast, and serve on a very hot dish. This
quantity will suffice for 3 persons.

the cup; beat up the eggs with the cream or milk, sugar and vanilla,
and divide the mixture into the cups. Cover each cup with buttered
paper, stand the cups in a stew-pan with boiling water, which should
reach only half-way up the cups, and steam the eggs until they are
set--time from 8 to 10 minutes. Turn the eggs out on the buttered
toast, and serve hot or cold.


SWISS EGGS.

4 eggs, 3 oz. of Gruyere cheese, 1 oz. of butter, 1 teaspoonful of
finely chopped parsley, pepper and salt to taste. Spread the butter on

Rub the garlic round a small saucepan, and melt the butter, in it; or
chop up very finely the shalots, and mix them with the butter. When
the butter is hot, stir in the wheatmeal, then the tomato pulp, and
stir until the mixture is thickened and comes away from the sides of
the pan, then proceed as before, stirring in one yolk after the other;
season with pepper and salt, whip up the whites of the eggs, stir them
with the other ingredients, pour into a buttered souffle pan, and bake

SALADS


These wholesome dishes are not used sufficiently by English people,
for very few know the value of them. All may use these foods with
benefit, and two dinners each week of them with Allinson wholemeal
bread will prevent many a serious illness. They are natural food in a
plain state, and supply the system with vegetable salts and acids in
the best form. In winter, salads may be made with endive, mustard and
cress, watercress, round lettuces, celery, or celery root, or even
finely cut raw red or white cabbage; pepper, salt, oil, and vinegar
are added as above. As a second course, milk or bread pudding. Salads
are invaluable in cases of gout, rheumatism, gallstones, stone in the
kidney or bladder, and in a gravelly condition of the water and impure
condition of the system.


ARTICHOKE SALAD.

Boil potatoes and artichokes separately, cut into slices; mix, add
pepper, salt, oil, and vinegar; eat with Allinson wholemeal bread.

A medium-sized boiled cauliflower, 3 boiled potatoes, juice of 1/2 a
lemon, 2 or 3 tablespoonfuls of oil. Cut up finely the cauliflower and
potatoes when cold, mix well with the dressing, and pepper and salt to
taste. A little mayonnaise is an improvement, but makes it rich.


CHEESE SALAD.

Put some finely shredded lettuce in a glass dish, and over this put
some young sliced onions, some mustard and cress, a layer of sliced
tomatoes, and two hard-boiled eggs, also sliced. Add salt and pepper,

quantity of oil should be about three times the amount of the vinegar
used. Eat with Allinson wholemeal bread.


POTATO SALAD (2).

add them to the potatoes. Mix the vinegar, oil, tarragon vinegar,
salt, and pepper well together, pour it into the salad bowl, and stir
it well. Garnish with beetroot and parsley.


SPANISH SALAD.

Put into the centre of the bowl some cold dressed French beans or
scarlet runners, and before serving pour over some good mayonnaise.

of cress.


SUMMER SALADS.

These are made from mixtures of lettuce, spring onions, cucumber,
tomatoes, or any other raw or cooked green foods, pepper, salt, oil,
and vinegar. Cold green peas, French beans, carrots, turnips, and
lettuce make a good cold salad for the summer.


WINTER SALAD.

Cut up 1 lb. of cold boiled potatoes, grate fine 1 onion and mix with
these, add watercress, or mustard and cress, and boiled and sliced
beetroot; flavour with pepper, salt, oil, and vinegar as above.

or pieces of orange may be advantageously mixed with the other
ingredients.

When oranges are added to a salad the onion must be left out.

SAUCES


Flesh-eaters have the gravy of meat to eat with their vegetables, and
when they give up the use of flesh they are often at a loss for a good
substitute. Sauces may be useful in more ways than one. When not too
highly spiced or seasoned they help to prevent thirst, as they supply
the system with fluid, and when made with the liquor in which
vegetables have been boiled they retain many valuable salts which
would otherwise have been lost. When foods are eaten in a natural
condition no sauces are required, but when food is changed by cooking
many persons require it to be made more appetising, as it is called.
The use of sauces is thus seen to be an aid to help down plain and
wholesome food, and being fluid they cause the food to be more
thoroughly broken up and made into a porridgy mass before it is
swallowed. From a health point of view artificial sauces are not good,
but if made as I direct very little harm will result.

Brown Gravy, Fried Onion Sauce, or Herb Gravy must be used with great
caution, or not at all by those who are troubled with heartburn,
acidity, biliousness, or skin eruptions of any kind.

The water in which vegetables (except cabbage or potatoes) have been
boiled is better for making sauces than ordinary water.


APPLE SAUCE.

1 lb. of apples, 1 gill of water, 1-1/2 oz. of sugar (or more,
according to taste), 1/2 a teaspoonful of mixed spice. Pare and core
the apples, cut them up, and cook them with the water until quite
mashed up, add sugar and spice. Rub the apples through a sieve,
re-heat, and serve. Can also be served cold.


APRICOT SAUCE.

1/2 lb. of apricot jam, 1/2 a teaspoonful of Allinson cornflour.
Dilute the jam with 1/2 pint of water, boil it up and pass it through
a sieve; boil the sauce up, and thicken it with the cornflour. Serve
hot or cold.


BOILED ONION SAUCE.

This is made as "Wheatmeal Sauce," but plenty of boiled and chopped
onions are mixed in it. This goes well with any plain vegetables.


BROWN GRAVY.

Put a tablespoonful of butter or olive oil into a frying-pan or
saucepan, make it hot, dredge in a tablespoonful of Allinson fine
wheatmeal, brown this, then add boiling water, with pepper and salt to
taste. A little mushroom or walnut ketchup may be added it desired.
Eat with vegetables or savouries.


BROWN SAUCE (1).

1 oz. of Allinson fine wheatmeal, 1 oz. of butter, the juice of 1/2 a
lemon, a blade of mace, pepper and salt to taste. Melt the butter in a
frying-pan over the fire, stir into it the meal, and keep on stirring
until it is a brown colour. Stir in gradually enough boiling water to
make the sauce of the thickness of cream. Add the lemon juice, the
mace, and seasoning, and let the sauce simmer for 20 minutes. Remove
the mace, and pour the sauce over the onions. If the sauce should be
lumpy, strain it through a gravy-strainer.

before serving.

boiled macaroni, or macaroni batter, or macaroni with turnips, &c.


CHOCOLATE SAUCE.

1 bar of Allinson chocolate, 1/2 pint of milk, 1/2 teaspoonful of
cornflour, 1/2 teaspoonful of vanilla essence. Melt the chocolate over

Fry the onions in the butter until nearly brown, add the meal, and
brown; add as much water as required to make the sauce the consistency
of cream; add the curry, vinegar, and seasoning. Let the whole simmer
for 5 to 10 minutes, strain the sauce, return to the saucepan, beat it

and thicken with the cornflour; beat up the egg, and after having
allowed the sauce to cool a little, add it gradually, taking care not
to curdle the sauce. Heat it up, but do not let it boil. To easily

MILK PUDDING.

The general rule for milk puddings is to take 4 oz. of farinaceous
food of any kind to 1 quart of milk. The best way to prepare most of
these puddings is to let the ingredients gently cook on the top of the
stove and then to turn them into a pie-dish to finish them in the oven
for 4 hour or a little longer, according to the heat of the oven.
Should eggs be added, they should be beaten well, then mixed with the
pudding before it goes into the oven. Most farinaceous milk puddings
are improved by the use of Allinson fine wheatmeal with the other
ingredients. For instance, use 2 oz. of giant sago and 2 oz. of
wheatmeal to 1 quart of milk; or for semolina pudding, the same
quantities of wheatmeal and semolina; and for vermicelli pudding the
same, with sugar and flavouring to taste.

TARTS


Special recipes for every kind of fruit tart are not given, as the
same rules apply to all. For the crust either of the recipes given for
pie-crusts may be used, and the fruit tarts can be made either open,
with a bottom crust only, with top and bottom crust, or with a top
crust only. When any dried fruit is used, like prunes, dried apricots,
apple-rings, &c., these should first be stewed till tender, and
sweetened if necessary, and allowed to cool; then place as much of the
fruit as is required into your tart, cover it with a crust, and bake
until the crust is done. If an open tart is made, only very little
juice should be used, as it would make the crust heavy.

Summer fruit, like strawberries, raspberries, currants, cherries, and
gooseberries need not be previously cooked. Mix the fruit with the
necessary sugar, and it the tart is made with a top crust only, a
little water can be added and an egg-cup or a little tea-cup should be
placed in the pie-dish upside down to keep up the crust.

thickened chocolate very gradually, and stir the whole over the fire,
taking care not to allow it to boil When well thickened let the cream
cool; serve in custard glasses or poured over sponge cakes or
macaroons.


CHOCOLATE CREAM (French) (1).

Use the whites of 3 eggs to 2 large bars of chocolate; vanilla to
taste. Break the chocolate in pieces, and melt it in a little
enamelled saucepan with very little water; stir it quite smooth, and
flavour with Allinson vanilla essence. Set the chocolate aside until
quite cold, when it should be a smooth paste, and not too firm. Beat
the whites of the eggs to a very stiff froth, and mix the chocolate
with it, stirring both well together until the chocolate is well mixed
with the froth. It the cream is not found sweet enough, add a little
castor sugar. Serve in a glass dish. This is easily made, and very
dainty.


CHOCOLATE CREAM (WHIPPED).

2 oz. of Allinson chocolate to 1/4 pint of cream, white of 1 egg.
Dissolve the chocolate over the fire with 2 tablespoonfuls of water;
let it get quite cold, and then mix it with the cream previously
whipped stiff; this will not require any additional sugar.


EGG CREAM.

The yolks of 6 eggs, 1/2 pint of water, juice of 1 lemon, 2 oz. of
sifted sugar, a little cinnamon. Beat up all the ingredients, put the
mixture into a saucepan over a sharp fire, and whisk it till quite
frothy, taking care not to let it boil; fill into glasses and serve at
once.


LEMON CREAM.

The juice of 3 lemons and the rind of 1, 7 eggs, 6 oz. of sugar, 1
dessertspoonful of cornflour. Proceed exactly as in "Orange Cream."


MACAROON CREAM.

Pound 1-1/2 doz. macaroons, place in a bowl, add 1 or 2 spoonfuls of
milk, and mix all to a smooth paste. Take a 6d. jar of cream, whip to
a stiff froth. Lay a little of the macaroon paste roughly in the
bottom of a glass dish, then 1 or 2 spoonfuls of the cream, more paste
and cream, then cover with 1 spoonful of cream put on roughly.


ORANGE CREAM.

6 oranges, 1 lemon, 7 eggs, 4 to 6 oz. of sugar (according to taste),
1 dessertspoonful of cornflour, some water. Take the juice of the
oranges and the juice and grated rind of the lemon. Add enough water
to the fruit juice to make 1-1/2 pints of liquid; let this get hot,
adding the sugar to it; mix the cornflour smooth with a spoonful of
cold water, and thicken the fruit juice with it, letting it boil up
for a minute, set aside and let it cool a little; beat the eggs well,
and when the liquid has cooled mix them carefully in with it; return
the whole over a gentle fire, keep stirring continually until the
cream thickens, but take care not to let it boil, as this would curdle
it. When cold, serve in custard glasses, or in a glass dish poured
over macaroons.


RASPBERRY CREAM.

1 quart of raspberries, sugar to taste, 1/2 pint of cream. Proceed as
in "Blackberry Cream."


RUSSIAN CREAM.

Lay 6 sponge cakes on a glass dish, and soak them with any fruit
syrup; then add 1 pint of blancmange. When nearly cold cover the top
with ratafia biscuits and decorate with angelica and cherries.


STRAWBERRY CREAM.

1 quart of strawberries, sugar to taste, 1/2 pint of cream. Proceed as
in "Blackberry Cream."


SWISS CREAM.

1/2 pint of cream, 1/2 pint of milk, 1 tablespoonful of Allinson
cornflour, 1/4 lb. of macaroons, 2 oz. of ratafias, vanilla, and sugar
to taste. Put the cream and milk over the fire, adding a piece of
vanilla 2 inches long, and sugar to taste; smooth the cornflour with a
tablespoonful of cold milk, mix it with the milk and cream when nearly
boiling, stir the mixture over the fire until it has thickened and let
it simmer 2 minutes longer, always stirring; remove the vanilla,
arrange the macaroons and ratafias on a shallow glass dish, let the
cream cool a little, then pour it over the biscuits and serve cold.
This makes a delicious dish.


WHIPPED CREAMS.

Quantity of good thick cream according to requirement. The white of 1
egg to 1/4 pint. Whip it well with a whisk or fork until it gets quite
thick; in hot weather it should be kept on ice or standing in another
basin with cold water, as the cream might curdle. Add sugar to taste
and whatever flavouring might be desired, this latter giving the cream
its name. When whipped cream is used to pour over sweets, &c., flavour
it with stick vanilla; a piece 1 inch long is sufficient for 1/2 pint
of cream; it must be split and as much as possible of the little
grains in it rubbed into the cream.




CUSTARDS


ALMOND CUSTARD.

1 quart of milk, 6 eggs, 1 dessertspoonful of Allinson cornflour, 1
wineglassful of rosewater, sugar to taste, 1/2 lb. ground almonds.
Boil the milk with the sugar and almonds; smooth the cornflour with
the rosewater and stir it into the boiling milk, let it boil up for a
minute. Beat up the eggs, leaving out 3 of the whites of the eggs,
which are to be beaten to a stiff froth. Let the milk cool a little,
then stir in the eggs very gradually, taking care not to curdle them;
stir over the fire until the custard is nearly boiling, then let it
cool, stirring occasionally; pour it into a glass dish, and pile the
whipped whites of the eggs on the top of the custard just before
serving.


BAKED APPLE CUSTARD.

8 large apples, moist sugar to taste, half a teacupful of water and
the juice of half a lemon, 1 pint of custard made with Allinson
custard powder. Peel, cut and core the apples and put into a lined
saucepan with the water, sugar, and lemon juice, stew till tender and
rub through a sieve; when cold put the fruit at the bottom of a
pie-dish and pour the custard over, grate a little nutmeg over the
top, bake lightly, and serve cold.


BAKED CUSTARD.

1 quart of milk, 6 eggs, sugar, and flavouring to taste. Heat the milk
until nearly boiling, sweeten it with sugar, and add any kind of
flavouring. Whip up the eggs, and mix them carefully with the hot
milk. Pour the custard into a buttered pie-dish, and bake it in a
moderately hot oven until set. If the milk and eggs are mixed cold and
then baked the custard goes watery; it is therefore important to bear
in mind that the milk should first be heated. Serve with stewed fruit.


CARAMEL CUSTARD.

1-1/2 pints of milk, 4 eggs, 1 dessertspoonful of sugar, 1/2 lemon and
4 oz. of castor sugar for caramel. Put the dry castor sugar into an
enamelled saucepan and let it melt and turn a rich brown over the
fire, stirring all the time. When the sugar is melted and browned stir
into it about 2 tablespoonfuls of hot water, and the juice of 1/2
lemon. Then pour the caramel into a mould or cake-tin, and let it run
all round the sides of the tin. Meanwhile heat the milk near
boiling-point, and add the vanilla and sugar. Whip up the eggs, stir
carefully into them the hot milk, so as not to curdle the eggs. Then
pour the custard into the tin on the caramel and stand the tin in a
larger tin with hot water, place it in the oven, and bake in a
moderately hot oven for about 20 minutes or until the custard is set.
Allow it to get cold, turn out, and serve.


CARAMEL CUP CUSTARD (French).

Make the custard as in the recipe for "Cup Custard." Take 4 oz. of
castor sugar; put it over a brisk fire in a small enamelled saucepan,
keep stirring it until quite melted and a rich brown. Then cautiously
add 2 tablespoonfuls of boiling water, taking care not to be scalded
by the spluttering sugar. Gradually stir the caramel into the hot
custard. Let it cool, and serve in custard glasses.


CUP CUSTARD.

6 whole eggs or 10 yolks of eggs, 1 quart of milk, sugar and vanilla
to taste. Beat the eggs well while the milk is being heated. Use
vanilla pods to flavour--they are better than the essence, which is
alcoholic; split a piece of the pod 3 or 4 inches long, and let it
soak in the milk for 1 hour before it is set over the fire, so as to
extract the flavour from the vanilla. Sweeten the milk and let it
come nearly to boiling-point. Carefully stir the milk into the beaten
eggs, adding only a little at a time, so as not to curdle the eggs.
When all is mixed, pour the custard into a jug, which should be placed
in a saucepanful of boiling water. Keep stirring the custard with a
wooden spoon, and as soon as the custard begins to coat the spoon
remove the saucepan from the fire, and continue stirring the custard
until it is well thickened. In doing as here directed there is no risk
of the custard curdling, for directly the water ceases to boil it
cannot curdle the custard, although it is hot enough to finish
thickening it. If the milk is nearly boiling when mixed with the eggs,
the custard will only take from 5 to 10 minutes to finish. When the
custard is done place the jug in which it was made in a bowl of cold
water, stir it often while cooling to prevent a skin forming on the
top. Remove the vanilla pod and pour the custard into glasses. Should
the custard be required very thick, 8 eggs should be used, or the milk
can first be thickened with a dessertspoonful of Allinson cornflour
before mixing it with the 6 eggs. This is an excellent plan; it saves
eggs, and the custard tastes just as rich as if more eggs were used.
Serve in custard glasses, or in a glass dish.


CUSTARD (ALLINSON).

1 pint of milk or cream, 2 oz. of lump sugar and 1 packet of Allinson
custard powder. Put the contents of the packet into a basin and mix to
a smooth, thin paste with about 2 tablespoonfuls of the milk; boil the
remainder of milk with the sugar, and when quite boiling pour quickly
into the basin, stirring thoroughly; stir occasionally until quite
cold, then pour into custard glasses and grate a little nutmeg on the
top, or put in a glass dish and serve with stewed or tinned fruits, or
the custard can be used with Christmas or plum pudding instead of
sauce.

When the custard has been standing over night, it should be well
stirred before using.


CUSTARD IN PASTRY OR KENTISH PUDDING PIE.

Line a pie-dish with puff paste, prick well with a fork and bake
carefully, then fill the case with a custard made as follows. Mix 1
dessertspoonful of flour with the contents of a packet of Allinson
custard powder, out of a pint of milk take 8 tablespoonfuls and mix
well with the flour, custard powder, &c., boil the remainder of milk
with sugar to taste and 1 oz. of butter and when quite boiling pour on
to the custard powder, stir quickly for a minute, then pour into the
pastry case, grate a little nutmeg on the top and bake till of a
golden brown; serve either hot or cold.


FRUMENTY.

1 quart of milk, 1/2 pint of ready boiled wheat (boiled in water), 1/4
lb. of sultanas and currants mixed, sugar to taste, 4 eggs, a stick of
cinnamon. Mix the milk with the wheat (which should be fresh), the
sugar and fruit, adding the cinnamon, and let all cook gently over a
low fire, stirring frequently; when the mixture is nicely thickened
remove it from the fire and let it cool; beat up the eggs and
gradually mix them with the rest, taking great care not to curdle
them. Stir the frumenty over the fire, but do not allow to boil. Serve
hot or cold. The wheat should be fresh and soaked for 24 hours, and
then cooked from 3 to 5 hours.


GOOSEBERRY CUSTARD.

Make some good puff paste and line a pie-dish with it, putting a
double row round the edge. With 1/2 lb. of castor sugar stew 1 lb. of
green gooseberries until the skins are tender, then rub them through a
sieve. Scald 1 pint of milk, mix 1 tablespoonful of Allinson cornflour
to a smooth paste with cold milk, add it to the milk when boiling, let
it boil for 5 minutes, gently stirring it all the time, then turn it
into a bowl and let it become cool. Add 1/4 lb. of castor sugar, 2 oz.
of butter melted and dropped in gradually whilst the mixture is
beaten, then put in the well-beaten yolks of 6 eggs, add the mashed
gooseberries in small quantities, and lastly the whites of the eggs
whipped to a stiff froth; beat all together for a minute to mix well.
Pour this into the lined pie-dish and bake 25 or 30 minutes; serve in
the pie-dish. This can be made from any kind of acid fruit, and is as
good cold as hot.


GOOSEBERRY FOOL.

Top and tail 1 pint of gooseberries, put into a lined saucepan with
sugar to taste and half a small teacupful of water, stew gently until
perfectly tender, rub through a sieve, and when quite cold add 1 pint
of custard made with Allinson custard powder, which should have been
allowed to become cold before being mixed with the fruit. Serve in a
glass dish with sponge fingers.

N.B.--Apple fool is made in exactly the same way as above,
substituting sharp apples for the gooseberries.


MACARONI CUSTARD.

4 oz. of Allinson macaroni, 3 eggs, 1 tablespoonful of sugar, 1 even
dessertspoonful of Allinson cornflour, vanilla to taste. Boil the
macaroni in 1 pint of milk, and add a little water it needed; when
quite tender place it on a glass dish to cool; make a custard of the
rest of the milk and the other ingredients; flavour it well with
vanilla; when the custard is cool pour it over the macaroni, and serve
with or without stewed fruit.


MACAROON CUSTARD.

1/2 lb. of macaroons, 1 quart of milk, 6 eggs, 1 dessertspoonful of
Allinson cornflour, sugar and vanilla essence to taste. Boil the milk
and stir into it the cornflour smoothed with a little of the milk;
whip up the eggs, and carefully stir in the milk (which should have
been allowed to go off the boil) without curdling it; add sugar and
vanilla to taste, and stir the custard over the fire until it
thickens, placing it in a jug into a saucepan of boiling water.
Arrange the macaroons in a glass dish, and when the custard is cool
enough not to crack the dish, pour it over them and sprinkle some
ground almonds on the top. Serve cold.


ORANGE CUSTARD.

The juice of 6 oranges and of 1/2 a lemon, 6 eggs, 6 oz. of sugar, and
1 dessertspoonful of Allinson cornflour. Add enough water to the fruit
juices to make 1-1/2 pints of liquid. Set this over the fire with the
sugar; meanwhile smooth the cornflour with a little cold water, and
thicken the liquid with it when boiling. Set aside the saucepan,
(which should be an enamelled one) so as to cool the contents a
little. Beat up the eggs, gradually stir into them the thickened
liquid, and then proceed with the custard as in the previous recipe.
This is a German sweet, and very delicious.


RASPBERRY CUSTARD.

1-1/2 pints of raspberries, 1/2 pint of red currants, 6 oz. of sugar,
7 eggs, 1 dessertspoonful of Allinson cornflour. Mix the fruit, and
let it cook from 5 to 10 minutes with 1 pint of water; strain the
juice well through a piece of muslin or a fine hair-sieve. There
should be 1 quart of juice; if necessary add a little more water;
return the juice to the saucepan, add the sugar and reheat the liquid;
when it boils thicken it with the cornflour, then set it aside to
cool. Beat up the eggs, add them carefully after the fruit juice has
somewhat cooled; stir the custard over the fire until it thickens, but
do not allow it to boil, as the eggs would curdle. Serve cold in
custard glasses, or in a glass dish poured over macaroons or sponge
cakes. You can make a fruit custard in this way, with strawberries,
cherries, red currants, or any juicy summer fruit.


STRAWBERRY CUSTARD.

Remove the stalks from 1 lb. of fresh strawberries, place them in a
glass dish and scatter over 2 tablespoonfuls of pounded sugar; prepare
1 pint of custard with Allinson custard powder according to recipe
given above, and while still hot pour carefully over the fruit, set
aside to cool, and just before serving (which must not be until the
custard has become quite cold) garnish the top with a few fine
strawberries.




APPLE COOKERY


APPLES (BUTTERED).

1 lb. of apples, 2 oz. of butter, ground cinnamon and sugar to taste.
Pare, core, and slice the apples; heat the butter in a frying-pan,
when it boils turn in the apples and fry them until cooked; sprinkle
with sugar and cinnamon, and serve on buttered toast.


APPLE CAKE

6 oz. each of Allinson fine wheatmeal and white flour, 4-1/2 oz. of
butter, 1 egg, a little cold water, 1-1/2 lbs. of apples, 1 heaped-up
teaspoonful of cinnamon, and 3 oz. of castor sugar. Rub the butter
into the meal and flour, beat up the egg and add it, and as much cold
water as is required to make a smooth paste; roll out the greater part
of it 1/4 inch thick, and line a flat buttered tin with it. Pare,
core, and cut the apples into thin divisions, arrange them in close
rows on the paste point down, leaving 1 inch of edge uncovered; sift
the sugar and cinnamon over the apples; roll out thinly the rest of
the paste, cover the apples with it, turn up the edges of the bottom
crust over the edges of the top crust, make 2 incisions in the crust,
and bake the cake until brown in a moderately hot oven; when cold sift
castor sugar over it, slip the cake off the tin, cut into pieces, and
serve.


APPLE CHARLOTTE.

2 lbs. of good cooking apples, 2 oz. of chopped almonds, 4 oz. of
currants and sultanas mixed, 1 stick of cinnamon about 3 inches long,
sugar to taste, the juice of 1/2 a lemon, and Allinson bread and
butter cut very thinly. Pare, core, and cut up the apples, and stew
them with a teacupful of water and the cinnamon, until the apples have
become a pulp; remove the cinnamon, and add sugar, lemon juice, the
almonds, and the currants and sultanas, previously picked, washed, and
dried; mix all well and allow the mixture to cool; butter a pie-dish
and line it with thin slices of bread and butter, then place on it a
layer of apple mixture, repeat the layers, finishing with slices of
bread and butter; bake for 3/4 hour in a moderate oven.


APPLES (DRYING).

Those who have apple-trees are often at a loss to know what to do with
the windfalls. The apples come down on some days by the bushel, and it
is impossible to use them all up for apple pie, puddings, or jelly. An
excellent way to keep them for winter use is to dry them. It gives a
little trouble, but one is well repaid for it, for the home-dried
apples are superior in flavour to any bought apple-rings or pippins.
Peel your apples, cut away the cores and all the worm-eaten parts--for
nearly the whole of the windfalls are more or less worm-eaten. The
good parts cut into thin pieces, spread them on large sheets of paper
in the sun. In the evening (before the dew falls), they should be
taken indoors and spread on tins (but with paper underneath), on the
cool kitchen stove, and if the oven is only just warm, placed in the
oven well spread out; of course they require frequent turning about,
both in the sun and on the stove. Next day they may again be spread in
the sun, and will probably be quite dry in the course of the day.
Should the weather be rainy, the apples must be dried indoors only,
and extra care must then be taken that they are neither scorched nor
cooked on the stove. Whilst cooking is going on they will dry nicely
on sheets of paper on the plate-rack. When the apples are quite dry,
which is when the outside is not moist at all, fill them into brown
paper bags and hang them up in an airy, dry place. The apples will be
found delicious in flavour when stewed, and most acceptable when fresh
fruit is scarce. I have dried several bushels of apples in this way
every year.


APPLE DUMPLINGS.

Core as many apples as may be required. Fill the holes with a mixture
of sugar and cinnamon; make a paste for a short crust, roll it out,
and wrap each apple in it. Bake the dumplings about 30 or 40 minutes
in the oven, or boil them the same time in plenty of water, placing
the dumplings in the water when it boils fast. Serve with cream or
sweet white sauce.


APPLE FOOL.

2 lbs. of apples, 1/2 lb. of dates, 3/4 pint of milk, 1/4 pint of
cream, 6 cloves tied in muslin, and a little sugar. Pare, core, and
cut up the apples, stone the dates, and gently stew the fruit with a
teacupful of water and the cloves until quite tender; when
sufficiently cooked, remove the cloves, and rub the fruit through a
sieve; gradually mix in the milk, which should be boiling, then the
cream; serve cold with sponge-cake fingers.


APPLE FRITTERS.

3 good juicy cooking apples, 3 eggs, 6 oz. of Allinson fine wheatmeal,
1/2 pint of milk, and sugar to taste. Pare and core the apples, and
cut them into rounds 1/4 inch thick; make a batter with the milk,
meal, and the eggs well beaten, adding sugar to taste. Have a
frying-pan ready on the fire with boiling oil, vege-butter, or butter,
dip the apple slices into the batter and fry the fritters until golden
brown; drain them on blotting paper, and keep them hot in the oven
until all are done.


APPLE JELLY.

1 pint of water to each 1 lb. of apples. Wash and cut up the apples,
and boil them in the water until tender; then pour them into a jelly
bag and let drain well; take 1 lb. of loaf sugar to each pint of
juice, and the juice of 1 lemon to each quart of liquid. Boil the
liquid, skimming carefully, until the jelly sets when cold if a drop
is tried on a plate. It may take from 2 hours to 3 hours in boiling.


APPLE PANCAKES.

Make the batter as directed in the recipe for "Apple Fritters," peel 2
apples, and cut them in thin slices, mix them with the batter, add
sugar and cinnamon to taste, a little lemon juice if liked, and fry
the pancakes in the usual way.


APPLE PUDDING.

1-1/2 lbs. of apples, 1 teaspoonful of ground cinnamon, sugar to
taste, 1/2 lb. of Allinson fine wheatmeal, and 2-1/2 oz. of butter or
vege-butter. Pare, core, and cut up the apples; make a paste of the
meal, butter and a little cold water; roll the paste out, line a
pudding basin with the greater part of it, put in the apples, and
sprinkle over them the cinnamon and 4 oz. of sugar--a little more
should the apples be very sour; cover the apples with the rest of the
paste, and press the edges together round the sides; tie a cloth over
the basin and boil the pudding for 2-1/2 to 3 hours in a saucepan with
boiling water.


APPLE PUDDING (Nottingham).

6 baking apples, 2 oz. of sugar, 1 heaped up teaspoonful of ground
cinnamon, 3/4 pint of milk, 3 eggs, 6 oz. of Allinson wholemeal, and 1
oz. of butter. Core the apples, mix the sugar and cinnamon, and fill
the hole where the core was with it; put the apples into a buttered
pie-dish; make a batter of the milk, eggs, and meal, melt the butter
and mix it into the batter; pour it over the apples, and bake the
pudding for 2 hours in a moderate oven.


APPLE SAGO.

5 oz. of sago, 1-1/2 lbs. of apples, the juice of a lemon, a
teaspoonful of ground cinnamon, and sugar to taste. Wash the sago and
cook it in 1-1/2 pints of water, to which the cinnamon is added;
meanwhile have the apples ready, pared, cored, and cut up; cook them
in very little water, just enough to keep the apples from burning;
when they are quite soft rub them through a sieve and mix them with
the cooking sago, adding sugar and lemon juice; let all cook gently
for a few minutes or until the sago is quite soft; put the mixture
into a wetted mould, and turn out when cold.


APPLE SAUCE.

1 lb. of good cooking apples, sugar to taste. Pare, core, and cut in
pieces the apples, cook them in a few spoonfuls of water to prevent
them burning; when quite soft rub the apple through a sieve, and
sweeten the sauce to taste. Rubbing the sauce through a sieve ensures
the sauce being free from pieces should the apple not pulp evenly.


APPLE TART (OPEN).

2 lbs. of apples, 1 cupful of currants and sultanas, 2 oz. of chopped
almonds, sugar to taste, 1 teaspoonful of ground cinnamon or the rind
of 1/2 lemon (which latter should be removed after cooking with the
apples), 12 oz. or Allinson fine wheatmeal, and 4-1/2 oz. of butter.
Pare, core, and cut up the apples; stew them in very little water,
only just enough to keep from burning; when nearly done add the
currants, sultanas, almonds, cinnamon, and sugar; let all simmer
together until the apples have become a pulp; let the fruit cool; make
a paste of the meal, butter, and a little water; roll it out and line
a round, flat dish with it, and brush the paste over with white of
eggs; turn the apple mixture on the paste; cut the rest of the paste
into strips 3/8 of an inch wide, and lay them over the apples in
diamond shape, each 1 inch from the other, so as to make a kind of
trellis arrangement of the pastry. If enough paste is left, lay a thin
strip right round the dish to finish off the edge, mark it nicely with
a fork or spoon, and bake the tart for 3/4 hour. Serve with white
sauce or custard.


APPLES (RICE)

2 lbs. of apples, 1/2 lb. of rice, the rind of 1/2 lemon (or a piece
of stick cinnamon if preferred), 4 oz. of sultanas, sugar to taste, 1
oz. of butter, and, if the apples are not sour, the juice of a lemon.
Boil the rice in 3 pints of water with the lemon rind, then add the
apples, pared, cored, and sliced, the sultanas, butter, lemon juice,
and sugar; let all simmer gently for 1/2 hour, or until quite tender;
if too dry add a little more water; remove the lemon rind before
serving.


EVE PUDDING.

1/2 lb. each of apples and breadcrumbs, and 1/2 lb. of currants and
sultanas mixed, 5 eggs well beaten, sugar to taste, the grated rind
and juice of 1 lemon, and 2 oz. of butter. Peel, core, and chop small
the apples, mix them with the breadcrumbs, sugar, currants, and
sultanas (washed and picked), the lemon juice and rind, and the
butter, previously melted; whip up the eggs and mix them well with the
other ingredients; turn the mixture into a buttered mould, tie with a
cloth, and steam the pudding for 3 hours.




BREAD AND CAKES


THE ADVANTAGES OF WHOLEMEAL BREAD.

People are now concerning themselves about the foods they eat, and
inquiring into their properties, composition, and suitability. One
food that is now receiving a good deal of attention is bread, and we
ought to be sure that this is of the best kind, for as a nation we eat
daily a pound of it per head. We consume more of this article of food
than of any other, and this is as it ought to be, for bread is the
staff of life, and many of the other things we eat are garnishings. It
is said we cannot live on bread alone, but this is untrue if the loaf
is a proper one; at one time our prisoners were fed on it alone, and
the peasantry of many countries live on very little else.

Not many years ago books treating of food and nutrition always gave
milk as the standard food, and so it is for calves and babies.
Nowadays we use a grain food as the standard, and of all grains wheat
is the one which is nearest perfection, or which supplies to the body
those elements that it requires, and in best proportions. A perfect
food must contain carbonaceous, nitrogenous, and mineral matter in
definite quantities; there must be from four to six parts of
carbonaceous or heat and force-forming matter to one of nitrogen, and
from two to four per cent. of mineral matter; also a certain bulk of
innutritious matter for exciting secretion, for separating the
particles of food so that the various gastric and intestinal juices
may penetrate and dissolve out all the nutriment, and for carrying off
the excess of the biliary and other intestinal secretions with the

A grain of wheat consists of an outer hard covering or skin, a layer
of nitrogenous matter directly under this, and an inner kernel of
almost pure starch. The average composition of wheat is this:--

  Nitrogen             12
  Carbon               72
  Mineral Matter        4
  Water                12
                      ---
                      100


From this analysis we observe that the nitrogenous matter is to the
carbonaceous in the proportion of one-sixth, which is the composition
of a perfect food. Besides taking part in this composition, the bran,
being in a great measure insoluble, passes in bulk through the bowels,
assisting daily laxation--a most important consideration. If wheat is
such a perfect food, it must follow that wholemeal bread must be best
for our daily use. That such is the case, evidence on every side
shows; those who eat it are healthier, stronger, and more cheerful
than those who do not, all other things being equal. Wholemeal bread
comes nearer the standard of a perfect food than does the wheaten
grain, as in fermentation some of the starch is destroyed, and thus
the proportion of nitrogen is slightly increased.

The next question is, how shall we prepare the grain so as to make the
best bread from it? This is done by grinding the grain as finely as
possible with stones, and then using the resulting flour for
bread-making. The grain should be first cleaned and brushed, and
passed over a magnet to cleanse it from any bits of steel or iron it
may have acquired from the various processes it goes through, and then
finely ground. To ensure fine grinding, it is always advisable to
kiln-dry it first. When ground, nothing must be taken from it, nor
must anything be added to the flour, and from this bread should be
made. Baking powder, soda, and tartaric acid, or soda and hydrochloric
acid, or ammonia and hydrochloric acid, or other chemical agents,
must never be used for raising bread, as these substances are
injurious, and affect the human system for harm. The only ferment that
should be used is yeast; of this the French variety is best. If
brewer's yeast is used it must be first well washed, otherwise it
gives a bitter flavour to the loaf. A small quantity of salt may be
used, but not much, otherwise it adds an injurious agent to the bread.


BARLEY BANNOCKS.

Put 1/2 pint of milk into a saucepan allow it to boil; then sprinkle
in barley meal, stirring it constantly to prevent lumps till the
mixture is quite thick and almost unstirrable. Turn the mass out on a
meal-besprinkled board and leave to cool. When cool enough to knead,
work it quite stiff with dry meal, take a portion off, roll it as thin
as a wafer, and bake it on a hot girdle; when done on one side, turn
and cook on the other. The girdle is to be swept clean after each
bannock. Eat hot or cold with butter.

Whip the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, add the sugar, then the
almond meal, and mix all well; if the mixture seems very stiff add one
or two teaspoonfuls of water. Lay sheets of kitchen paper on tins,
over this sheets of rice wafers (or, as it is also called, "wafer
paper"), which can be obtained from confectioners and large stores;
drop little lumps of the mixture on the wafers, allowing room for the
spreading of the macaroons, place a couple of pieces of sliced almond
on each, and bake them in a quick oven until they are set and don't
feel wet to the touch. If the macaroons brown too much, place a sheet
of paper lightly over them.

yeast, milk to moisten the cake. Dissolve the yeast in a cup of warm
water, 100 degrees Fahrenheit in winter, 85 degrees in summer; make a
batter of the yeast and water, with two spoonfuls of the meal, and
stand it on a cool place of the stove to rise; do not let it get hot,
as this will spoil the yeast. Meanwhile prepare the fruit and almonds,
mix the meal, fruit, butter (or oil), sugar, cinnamon and eggs; then
add the yeast and as much lukewarm milk as is required to moisten the
cake. The dough should be fairly firm and wet. Let the dough rise in

out 3 times, and spread in the butter as for pastry; roll it very
thin, and cut into rounds or square cakes. Spread half of them very
thickly with currants, press the others very gently on the top, so as
to form a sandwich, and bake in a quick oven till a light brown.


SPONGE CAKE (1).

6 oz. fine wheatmeal, 1/2 lb. castor sugar, 4 eggs, any flavouring to

needle comes out clean.


SPONGE CAKE ROLY-POLY.

3 eggs, the weight of 2 in fine wheatmeal, of 8 in castor sugar, some
raspberry and currant jam. Mix the ingredients as directed in "Sponge
Cake," line a large, square, flat baking tin with buttered paper, pour
the mixture into it, and bake it in a fairly hot oven from 7 to 12
minutes, or until baked through. Have a sheet of white kitchen paper
on the kitchen table, on which sprinkle some white sugar. Turn the
cake out of the tin on to the paper, spread the cake with jam, and
roll up. This should be done quickly, for if the cake is allowed to
cool it will not roll.


UNFERMENTED BREAD.

This is as sweet and pure a bread as the finger-rolls, and keeps fresh
for several days, as it has to be mixed fairly moist. 2 lbs. of
Allinson wholemeal, 1-1/2 pints of milk and water; mix these to a
thick paste, and put the mixture into some small greased bread tins.
Loaves the size of the twopenny loaves will want 1-1/2 hours in a hot
oven.


UNFERMENTED FINGER-ROLLS.

These are bread in the simplest and purest form, and liked by most. 1
lb. of Allinson wholemeal, a good 1/2 pint of milk and water mixed;
mix the meal and the milk and water into a dough, knead it a few
minutes, then make the dough into finger-rolls on a floured
pastry-board, rolling the finger-rolls about 3 inches long with the
flat hand. Place them on a floured baking-tin, and bake them in a
sharp oven from 1/2 an hour to 1 hour. The time will depend on the
heat of the oven. In a very hot oven the rolls will be well baked in
1/2 an hour.


VICTORIA SANDWICH.

Proceed the same as in "Sponge Cake Roly-Poly," but bake the mixture
in 2 round, flat tins; spread jam on one, and cover with the other
cake.


WHOLEMEAL BREAD (FERMENTED).

This will be found useful where a large family has to be provided for,
or where it is desirable to bake bread for several days. 7 lbs. of
Allinson wholemeal, 2-1/2 pints of warm water (about 85 deg. Faht.), 1
teaspoonful salt, 1/2 oz. of yeast; dissolve the yeast in the water,
add the salt, put the meal into a pan, make a hole in the centre of
the meal, pour in the water with the yeast and salt, and mix the whole
into a dough. Allow it to stand, covered with a cloth, 1-1/2 hours in
front of the fire, turning the pan sometimes, so that the dough may
get warm evenly. Then knead the dough well through, and if necessary
add a little more warm water. Make the dough into round loaves, or
fill it into greased tins, and bake it for 1-1/2 hours. The oven
should be fairly hot. To know whether the bread is done, a clean
skewer or knife should be passed through a loaf. It it comes out clean
the bread is done; if it sticks it not sufficiently baked. When it is
desired to have a soft crust, the loaves may be baked under tins in
the oven.


WHOLEMEAL CAKE.

1 lb. of wholemeal, 4 oz. of sugar, 1 teaspoonful of cinnamon, 1
breakfastcupful of currants and sultanas mixed, well-washed and picked
over, 3 oz. of chopped sweet almonds, 1 dozen ground bitter almonds, 3
eggs, 1/4 oz. of German yeast, 1/4 lb. Vegebutter, and some warm milk.
Rub the butter into the meal, add the fruit, cinnamon, almonds and
sugar, and the eggs well beaten. Dissolve the yeast in a cupful of
warm milk (not hot milk) add it to the other ingredients, and make all
into a moist dough, adding as much more milk as is required to make
the dough sufficiently moist for the spoon to beat all together. Cover
the pan in which you mix the cake with a cloth, place it in front of
the fire, and allow the dough to rise 1-1/2 hours, turning the pan
round occasionally that the dough may be equally warm. Then fill the
dough into one or several well-greased tins, and bake the cake or
cakes from 1 to 1-1/2 hours (according to the size) in a hot oven. If
the cake browns too soon, cover it over with a sheet of paper.


WHOLEMEAL GEMS.

Mix Allinson wholemeal flour with cold water into a batter, pouring
this into greased and hot gem pans, and baking for 3/4 of an hour. All
bread should be left for a day or two to set before it is eaten,
otherwise it is apt to lie heavy on the stomach and cause a feeling of
weight and uncomfortableness.


WHOLEMEAL ROCK CAKES.

1 lb. of meal, 3 oz. of butter or vege-butter, 1/4 lb. of sugar, a
cupful of currants and sultanas mixed, 3 oz. of blanched almonds,
chopped fine, 1 teaspoonful of cinnamon, or the grated rind of half a
lemon, 3 eggs, and very little milk (about 3/4 of a teacup). Rub the
butter into the meal, add the fruit, almonds, sugar, and cinnamon,
beat up the eggs with the milk, and mix the whole to a stiff paste.
Flour 1 or 2 flat tins, place little lumps of the paste on them, and
bake the cakes in a quick oven 25 to 35 minutes. Particular care must
be taken that the paste should not be too moist, as in that case the
cakes would run. Vege-butter is a vegetable butter, made from the oil
which is extracted from cocoanuts and clarified. It can be obtained
from some of the larger stores, also from several depots of food
specialities. It is much cheaper than butter, and being very rich,
goes further.




MISCELLANEOUS


A DISH OF SNOW.

1 pint of thick apple sauce, sweetened and flavoured to taste (orange
or rosewater is preferable), the whites of 3 eggs, beaten to a stiff
froth. Mix both together, and serve.

A fair-sized cauliflower, 1 pint of milk, 1-1/2 oz. of dried Allinson
breadcrumbs, 3 oz. of cheese, 1-1/2 oz. of butter, 1 heaped-up
tablespoonful of Allinson wholemeal flour, a little nutmeg, and pepper
and salt to taste. Boil the cauliflower until half cooked, cut it into
pieces, and place them in a pie-dish. Boil the milk, adding the
seasoning, 1/2 oz. of the butter, and 1/2 a saltspoonful of the
nutmeg. Thicken with the wholemeal smoothed in a little cold milk or
water. Stir in the cheese and pour the sauce over the cauliflower.
Shake the breadcrumbs over the top, cut the rest of the butter in
bits, and place them over the breadcrumbs. Bake for 20 minutes to 1/2
an hour, or until the cauliflower is soft.


COMPOTE OF ORANGES AND APPLES.

6 oranges, 8 fine sweet apples, 1 oz. of ground sweet almonds, syrup
as in "Orange Syrup." Peel the oranges and the apples, cut them across

of butter or vege-butter, 1 cupful of cold water. Rub the butter into
the flour, add the water, and mix all into a paste with a knife. Roll
the paste out thin on a floured board, cut pieces out with a tumbler
or biscuit cutter. Line with them small patty pans, and fill them with
mincemeat; cover with paste, moisten the edges and press them
together, and bake the mince pies in a quick oven; they will be done
in 15 to 20 minutes.

sprinkle them with sugar and cinnamon, place a dessertspoonful of jam
on each, fold up, sprinkle with a little more sugar; keep hot until
all the pancakes are fried, and serve them very hot. When the pancakes
are golden brown on one side, they should be slipped on a plate,
turned back into the frying-pan, and fried brown on the other side.


MACARONI PANCAKES.

2 oz. of macaroni, 1/2 pint of milk, 3 eggs, 3 oz. of Allinson fine
wheatmeal, sugar to taste, the grated rind of a lemon, butter, and 1

quite soft; drain it and cut it into pieces 1 inch long. Make a batter
of the eggs, meal, and milk, add the lemon rind, sugar, and the
macaroni; fry pancakes of the mixture, using a small piece of butter
not bigger than a walnut for each pancake. Sift sugar over the
pancakes and serve them very hot with slices of lemon.

MINCEMEAT (another).

1 lb. each of raisins, apples, and currants, 1/2 lb. of butter, 1/2
lb. of blanched and chopped almonds, 1/2 lb. of moist sugar, the juice
of 4 lemons, and 1/2 lb. of mixed peel. Wash and pick the currants,
wash and stone the raisins, peel, core, and quarter the apples, and
cut up the mixed peel; then mince all up together, and add the chopped
almonds. Melt the butter, mix it thoroughly with the fruit, fill it
into one or more jars, cover with paper, and tie down tightly.


ORANGE FLOWER PUFF.

1/2 pint of milk, 3 eggs, 4 ozs. of Allinson fine wheatmeal, and 2
tablespoonfuls of orange water, some butter or oil for frying. Make a
batter of the milk, eggs (well beaten), and meal, add the orange
water, and fry the batter in thin pancakes, powder with castor sugar,
and serve.


ORANGE SYRUP.

The rind of 3 oranges, 1/2 pint of water, 4 oz. of sugar. Boil the
ingredients until the syrup is clear, then strain it and pour over the
fruit.


ORANGES IN SYRUP.

Peel 6 oranges, carefully removing all the white pith. Put the rinds
of these into 1/2 pint of cold water; boil it gently for 10 minutes.
Strain, and add to the water 6 oz, of loaf sugar. Boil it until it is
a thick syrup, then drop into it the oranges, divided in sections,
without breaking the skins. Only a few minutes cooking will be needed.
The oranges are nicest served cold.


RASPBERRY FROTH.

The whites of 5 eggs, 3 tablespoonfuls of raspberry jam. Beat the
whites of the eggs to a very stiff froth, then beat the jam up with it
and serve at once in custard glasses. This recipe can be varied by
using various kinds of jam.


RICE FRITTERS.

6 oz. of rice, 1 pint of milk, 8 oz. of sugar, 1 oz. of fresh butter,
6 oz. of apricot marmalade, 3 eggs. Let the rice swell in the milk
with the butter and the sugar over a slow fire until it is
tender--this will take about 1/2 of an hour; when the rice is done,
strain off any milk there may be left. Mix in the apricot marmalade
and the beaten eggs, stir it well over the fire until the eggs are
set; then spread the mixture on a dish, about 1/2 an inch thick. When
it is quite cold, cut it in long strips, dip them in a batter, and fry
them a nice brown. Strew sifted sugar over them, and serve.


SNOWBALLS.

1-1/2 pints of milk, 4 eggs, sugar and vanilla to taste, and 1
tablespoonful of cornflour. Boil the milk with sugar and a piece of
vanilla or with 1 dessertspoonful of vanilla essence. Smooth the
cornflour with a little cold milk, and thicken the milk with it. Whip
the whites of the eggs to a very stiff froth with 1 spoonful of castor
sugar, and drop spoonfuls of the froth into the boiling milk. Allow to
boil until the balls are well set, turning them over that both sides
may get done. Lift the balls out with a slice, and place them in a
glass dish. Beat up the yolks of the eggs, stir them carefully in the
hot milk; let the custard cool, and pour it into the glass dish, but
not over the snowballs, which should remain white.


SPONGE MOULD.

9 stale sponge cakes, some raspberry jam, 2 pints of milk, 8 oz. of
Allinson cornflour, sugar to taste, a few drops of almond essence.
Halve the sponge cakes, spread them with jam, arrange them in a
buttered mould, and soak them with 1/2 pint of the milk boiling hot.
Boil the rest of the milk and thicken it with the cornflour as for
blancmange; flavour with the essence and sugar; pour the mixture over
the sponge cakes, and turn all out when cold.


STEWED PEARS AND VANILLA CREAM.

Get 1 tin of pears, open it, and turn the contents into an enamelled
stewpan, add some sugar and liquid cochineal to colour the fruit, and
let them stew a few minutes. Take out the pears carefully without
breaking them, and let the syrup cook until it is thick. When the
pears are cold lay them on a dish with the cores upwards, and with a
spoon scoop out the core, and fill the space left with whipped cream
flavoured with vanilla and sweetened; sprinkle them with finely
shredded blanched almonds or pistachios, and pour the syrup round
them.


SWISS CREAMS.

4 oz. of macaroons, a little raisin wine and 1 pint of custard, made
with Allinson custard powder; lay the macaroons in a glass dish and
pour over enough raisin wine to soak them, make the custard in the
usual way, let it cool and then pour over the cakes; when quite cold
garnish with pieces of bright coloured jelly.


TAPIOCA ICE.

1 teacupful of tapioca, 1/2 teacupful of sifted sugar, 1 tinned
pineapple. Soak the tapioca over night in cold water; in the morning
boil it in 1 quart of water until perfectly clear, and add the sugar
and pineapple syrup. Chop up the pineapple and mix it with the boiling
hot tapioca; turn the mixture into a wet mould. When cold turn it out
and serve with cream and sugar.


TIPSY CAKE.

12 small sponge cakes, 1/2 lb. jam, 1 pint of custard made with
Allinson custard powder. Soak the sponge cakes in a little raisin
wine, arrange them on a deep glass dish in four layers, spread a
little jam on each layer and pour the custard round, decorate the top
with candid cherries and almonds blanched and split.




A WEEK'S MENU


I have written the following menus to help those who are beginning
vegetarianism. When first starting, most housewives do not know what
to provide, and this is a source of anxiety. I occasionally meet some
who have been vegetarians a long time, but confess that they do not
know how to provide a nice meal. They usually eat the plainest foods,
because they know of no tasty dishes. When visitors come, we like to
provide tempting dishes for them, and show them that appetising meals
can be prepared without the carcases of animals. I only give seven
menus, that is, one for each day of the week; but our dishes can be so
varied that we can have a different menu daily for weeks without any
repetition. The recipes here written give a fair idea to start with.
Instead of always using butter beans, or haricot beans, as directed in
one of these menus, lentils or split peas can be substituted. I have
not included macaroni cheese in these menus, because this dish is so
generally known; it can be introduced into any vegetarian dinner. I
have allowed three courses at the dinner, but they are really not
necessary. I give them to make the menus more complete. A substantial
soup and a pudding, or a savoury with vegetables and sauce and a
pudding, are sufficient for a good meal. In our own household we
rarely have more than two courses, and often only one course. This
article will be of assistance to all those who are wishing to try a
healthful and humane diet, and to those meat eaters who wish to
provide tasty meals for vegetarian friends.

Anna P. Allinson.

4, Spanish Place,
Manchester Square,
London, W.




_MENU I._


TOMATO SOUP.

1 tin of tomatoes or 2 lbs. of fresh ones, 1 large Spanish onion or
1/2 lb. of smaller ones, 2 oz. of butter, pepper and salt to taste, 1
oz. of vermicelli and 2 bay leaves. Peel the onions and chop up
roughly; brown them with the butter in the saucepan in which the soup
is made. When the onion is browned, add the tomatoes (the fresh ones
must be sliced) and 3 pints of water. Let all cook together for 1/2 an
hour. Then drain the liquid through a sieve without rubbing anything
through. Return the liquid to the saucepan, add the seasoning and the
vermicelli; then allow the soup to cook until the vermicelli is soft,
which will be in about 10 minutes. Sago, tapioca, or a little dried
julienne may be used instead of the vermicelli.


VEGETABLE PIE.

1/2 lb. each of tomatoes, turnips, carrots, potatoes, 1 tablespoonful
of sago, 1 teaspoonful of mixed herbs, 3 hard-boiled eggs, 2 oz. of
butter, and pepper and salt to taste. Prepare the vegetables, scald
and skin the tomatoes, cut them in pieces not bigger than a walnut,
stew them in the butter and 1 pint of water until nearly tender, add
the pepper and salt and the mixed herbs. When cooked, pour the
vegetables into a pie-dish, sprinkle in the sago, add water to make
gravy if necessary. Cut the hard-boiled eggs in quarters and place
them on the top of the vegetables, cover with a crust made from
Allinson wholemeal, and bake until it is brown.


SHORT CRUST.

10 oz. of Allinson wholemeal, 8 oz. of butter or vege-butter, 1
teacupful of cold water. Rub the butter into the meal, add the water,
mixing the paste with a knife. Roll it out, cut strips to line the rim
of the pie-dish, cover the vegetable with the crust, decorate it, and
bake the pie as directed.


GOLDEN SYRUP PUDDING.

10 oz. of Allinson wholemeal, 3 eggs, 1 pint of milk, and 1/2 lb. of
golden syrup. Grease a pudding basin, and pour the golden syrup into
it; make a batter with the milk, meal, and eggs, and pour this into
the pudding basin on the syrup, but do not stir the batter up with the
syrup. Place a piece of buttered paper on the top of the batter, tie a
cloth over the basin unless you have a basin with a fitting metal lid,
and steam the pudding for 2 1/2 hours in boiling water. Do not allow
any water to boil into the pudding. Dip the basin with the pudding in
it for 1 minute in cold water before turning it out, for then it comes
out more easily.




_MENU II._


CLEAR CELERY SOUP.

1 large head of celery or 2 small ones, 1 large Spanish onion, 2 oz.
of butter, pepper and salt to taste, and 1 blade of mace. Chop the
onion and fry it brown in the butter (or vege-butter) in the saucepan
in which the soup is to be made. When brown, add 4 pints of water, the
celery washed and cut into pieces, the mace, the pepper and salt. Let
all cook until the celery is quite soft, then drain the liquid from
the vegetables. Return it to the saucepan, boil the soup up, and add 1
oz. of vermicelli, sago, or Italian paste; let the soup cook until
this is quite soft, and serve with sippets of Allinson wholemeal
toast.


BUTTER BEANS WITH PARSLEY SAUCE.

Pick the beans, wash them and steep them over night in boiling water,
just covering them. Allow 2 or 3 oz. of beans for each person. In the
morning let them cook gently in the water they are steeped in, with
the addition of a little butter, until quite soft, which will be in
about 2 hours. The beans should be cooked in only enough water to keep
them from burning; therefore, when it boils away, add only just
sufficient for absorption. The sauce is made thus: 1 pint of milk, 1
tablespoonful of Allinson wholemeal, a handful of finely chopped
parsley, the juice of 1/2 a lemon, pepper and salt to taste. Boil the
milk and thicken it with the meal, which should first be smoothed with
a little cold milk, then last of all add the lemon juice, the
seasoning, and the parsley. This dish should be eaten with potatoes
and green vegetables.


GROUND RICE PUDDING.

1 quart of milk, 6 oz. of ground rice, 1 egg, and any kind of jam.
Boil the milk, stir into it the ground rice previously smoothed with
some of the cold milk. Let the mixture gook gently for 5 minutes, stir
frequently, draw the saucepan to the side, and when it has ceased to
boil add the egg well whipped, and mix well. Pour half of the mixture
into a pie-dish, spread a layer of jam over it, then pour the rest of
the pudding mixture over the jam, and let it brown lightly in the
oven.




_MENU III._


CARROT SOUP.

4 good-sized carrots, 1 small head of celery, 1 fair sized onion, a
turnip, 3 oz. of Allinson breadcrumbs, 1-1/2 oz. of butter, 1 blade of
mace, pepper and salt to taste. Scrape and wash the vegetables, and
cut them up small; set them over the fire with 3 pints of water, the
butter, bread, and mace. Let all boil together until the vegetables
are quite tender, and then rub them through a sieve. Return the
mixture to the saucepan, season with pepper and salt, and if too thick
add water to the soup, which should be as thick as cream. Boil the
soup up, and serve.


CURRIED RICE AND TOMATOES.

1/2 lb. of Patna rice, 1 dessertspoonful of curry powder, salt to
taste, and 1 oz. of butter. Wash the rice, put it over the fire in
cold water, let it just boil up, then drain the water off. Mix 1 pint
of cold water with the curry powder, put this over the fire with the
rice, butter, and salt. Cover the rice with a piece of buttered paper
and let it simmer gently until the water is absorbed. This will take
about 20 minutes. Rice cooked this way will have all the grains
separate. For the tomatoes proceed as follows: 1 lb. of tomatoes and a
little butter, pepper, and salt. Wash the tomatoes and place them in a
flat tin with a few spoonfuls of water; dust them with pepper and
salt, and place little bits of butter on each tomato. Bake them from
15 to 20 minutes, according to the size of the tomatoes and the heat
of the oven. Place the rice in the centre of a hot flat dish, put the
tomatoes round it, pour the liquid over the rice, and serve.


APPLE CHARLOTTE.

2 lbs. of cooking apples, 1 teacupful of mixed currants and sultanas,
1 heaped-up teaspoonful of ground cinnamon, 2 oz. of blanched and
chopped almonds, sugar to taste, Allinson wholemeal bread, and butter.
Pare, core, and cut up the apples and set them to cook with a
teacupful of water. Some apples require much more water than others.
When they are soft add the fruit picked and washed, the cinnamon, and
the almonds and sugar. Cut very thin slices of bread and butter, line
a buttered pie-dish with them. Place a layer of apples over the
buttered bread, and repeat the layers of bread and apples until the
dish is full, finishing with a layer of bread and butter. Bake from
3/4 of an hour to 1 hour.




_MENU IV._


RICE SOUP.

3 oz. of rice, 4 oz. of grated cheese, 1 breakfastcupful of tomato
juice, 1 oz. of butter, pepper and salt to taste. Boil the rice till
tender in 2-1/2 pints of water, with the butter and seasoning. When
quite soft, add the tomato juice and the cheese; stir until the soup
boils and the cheese is dissolved, and serve. If too much of the water
has boiled away, add a little more.


HOT-POT.

2 lbs. of potatoes, 3/4 lb. of onions, 1 breakfastcupful of tinned
tomatoes or 1/2 lb. of sliced fresh ones, 1 teaspoonful of mixed
herbs, 1-1/2 oz. butter, pepper and salt to taste. Those who do not
like tomatoes can leave them out, and the dish will still be very
savoury. The potatoes should be peeled, washed, and cut into thin
slices, and the onions peeled and cut into thin slices. Arrange the
vegetables and tomatoes in layers; dust a little pepper and salt
between the layer, and finish with a layer of potatoes. Cut the butter
into little bits, place them on the top of the potatoes, fill the dish
with hot water, and bake the hot-pot for 2 hours or more in a hot
oven. Add a little more hot water if necessary while baking to make up
for what is lost in the cooking.


CABINET PUDDING.

4 slices of Allinson bread toasted, 1-1/4 pints of milk, 8 eggs, 1 oz.
of butter, sugar to taste, 2 oz. of chopped almonds, 1 teacupful of
mixed currants and sultanas and any kind of flavouring--cinammon,
lemon, vanilla, or almond essence. Crush the toast in your hands, and
soak it in the milk. Whip the eggs up, melt the butter, and add both
to the soaked toast. Thoroughly mix all the various ingredients
together. Butter a pie-dish and pour the pudding mixture into it; put
a few bits of butter on the top, and bake the pudding for 1 hour in a
moderately hot oven.




_MENU V._


LEEK SOUP.

2 bunches of leeks, 1-1/2 pints of milk, 1 oz. of butter, 1 lb. of
potatoes, pepper and salt to taste, and the juice of 1 lemon. Cut off
the coarse part of the green ends of the leeks, and cut the leeks
lengthways, so as to be able to brush out the grit. Wash the leeks
well, and see no grit remains, then out them in short pieces. Peel,
wash, and cut up the potatoes, then cook both vegetables with 2 pints
of water. When the vegetables are quite tender, rub them through a
sieve. Return the mixture to the saucepan, add the butter, milk, and
seasoning, and boil the soup up again. Before serving, add the Lemon
juice; serve with sippets of toast or Allinson rusks.


MUSHROOM SAVOURY.

4 slices Allinson bread toast, 8 eggs, 1 pint of milk, 3 oz. of butter,
1 lb. of mushrooms, 1 small onion chopped fine, and pepper and salt to
taste. Crush the toast with your hand and soak it in the milk; add the
eggs well whipped. Peel, wash, and out up the mushrooms, and fry them
and the onion in the butter. When they have cooked in the butter for
10 minutes add them to the other ingredients, and season with pepper
and salt. Pour the mixture into a greased pie-dish and bake the
savoury for 1 hour. Serve with green vegetables, potatoes, and tomato
sauce.


CHOCOLATE MOULD.

1 quart of milk, 2 oz. of potato flour, 2 oz. of Allinson fine
wheatmeal, 1 heaped-up tablespoonful of cocoa, 1 dessertspoonful of
vanilla essence, and sugar to taste. Smooth the potato flour,
wheatmeal, and cocoa with some of the milk. Add sugar to the rest of
the milk, boil it up and thicken it with the smoothed ingredients. Let
all simmer for 10 minutes, stir frequently, add the vanilla, and mix
it well through. Pour the mixture into a wetted mould; turn out when
cold, and serve plain or with cold white sauce.




_MENU VI._


ARTICHOKE SOUP.

1 lb. each of artichokes and potatoes, 1 Spanish onion, 1 oz. of
butter, 1 pint of milk, and pepper and salt to taste. Peel, wash, and
cut into dice the artichokes, potatoes, and onion. Cook them until
tender in 1 quart of water with the butter and seasoning. When the
vegetables are tender rub them through a sieve. Return the liquid to
the saucepan, add the milk and boil the soup up again. Add water it
the soup is too thick. Serve with small dice of bread fried crisp in
butter or vege-butter.


YORKSHIRE PUDDING.

4 eggs, 1/2 lb. of Allinson fine wheatmeal, 1 pint of milk, pepper and
salt to taste, 1 oz. of butter. Thoroughly beat the eggs, make a
batter of them with the flour and milk, and season it. Well butter a
shallow tin, pour in the batter, and cut the rest of the butter in
bits. Scatter them over the batter and bake it 3/4 of an hour. Serve
with vegetables, potatoes, and sauce. To use half each of Allinson
breakfast oats and wheatmeal flour will be found very tasty.


BAKED CARAMEL CUSTARD.

1-1/2 pints of milk, 5 eggs, vanilla essence, 4 oz. of castor sugar
for the caramel, and a little more sugar to sweeten the custard. Heat
the milk, whip up the eggs, and carefully stir the hot milk into the
beaten eggs; flavour with vanilla and sugar to taste. Meanwhile put
the castor sugar into a small enamelled saucepan and stir it over a
quick fire until it is quite melted and brown. Add about 2
tablespoonfuls of hot water to the caramel, stir thoroughly, and pour
it into a tin mould or a cake tin. Let the caramel run all round the
sides of the tin; pour in the custard, and bake it in a moderate oven,
standing in a larger tin of boiling water, until the custard is set.
Let it get cold, turn out, and serve. This is a very dainty sweet
dish.




_MENU VII._


POTATO SOUP.

2 lbs. of potatoes, 1/2 a stick of celery or the outer stalks of a
head of celery, saving the heart for table use, 1 large Spanish onion,
1 pint of milk, 1 oz. of butter, a heaped-up tablespoonful of finely
chopped Parsley, and pepper and salt to taste. Peel, wash, and cut in
pieces the potatoes, peel and chop roughly the onion, prepare and cut
in small pieces the celery. Cook the vegetables in 8 pints of water
until they are quite soft. Rub them through a sieve, return the fluid
mixture to the saucepan; add the milk, butter, and seasoning, and boil
the soup up again; if too thick, add more water. Mix the parsley in
the soup just before serving.


BREAD AND CHEESE SAVOURY.

1/2 lb. of Allinson bread, 3 oz. of grated cheese, 1 pint of milk, 3
eggs, pepper and salt to taste, a little nutmeg, and some butter. Cut
the bread into slices and butter them; arrange in layers in a
pie-dish, spreading some cheese between the layers, and dusting with
pepper, salt, and a little nutmeg. Finish with a good sprinkling of
cheese. Whip up the eggs, mix them with the milk, and pour the mixture
over the bread and cheese in the pie-dish. Pour the custard back into
the basin, and repeat the pouring over the contents of the pie-dish.
If this is done two or three times, the top slices of bread and butter
get soaked, and then bake better. This should also be done when a
bread and butter pudding is made. Bake the savoury until brown, which
it will be in about 3/4 of an hour.


ORANGE MOULD.

The juice of 7 oranges and of 1 lemon, 6 oz. of sugar, 4 eggs, and 4
oz. of Allinson cornflour. Add enough water to the fruit juices to
make 1 quart of liquid; put 1-1/2 pints of this over the fire with the
sugar. With the rest smooth the cornflour and mix with it the eggs
well beaten. When the liquid in the saucepan is near the boil, stir
into it the mixture of egg and cornflour. Keep stirring the mixture
over a gentle fire until it has cooked 5 minutes. Turn it into a
wetted mould and allow to get cold, then turn out and serve.

BARLEY.

The plants _Hordeum Distichon_ and _Hordeum Vulgare_ supply most of
the barley used in this country. Barley has been used as a food from
time out of mind. We find frequent mention of it in the Bible, and in
old Latin and Greek books. According to Pliny, an ancient Roman
writer, the gladiators were called Hordearii, or "barley eaters,"
because they were fed on this grain whilst training. These Hordearii
were like our pugilists, except that they often fought to the death.
Barley has been used from very ancient days for making an intoxicating
drink. In Nubia, the liquor made from barley was called Bouzah, from
which we get our English word "booze," meaning an intoxicating drink.
The first intoxicant drink made in this country was ale, and it was
made from barley. Hops were not used for beer or ale in those days.
Barley is a good food, and was the chief food of our peasantry until
the beginning of the nineteenth century. Barley contains about 7 per
cent. of sugar, and its flesh-forming matter is in the form of casin
the same as is found in cheese. This casin is not elastic like the
gluten of wheat, so that one cannot make a light bread from barley.
Here is the chemical composition of barley meal:--

  Flesh formers                        7.5
  Heat and force formers (carbon)[A]  76.0
  Mineral matters                      2.0
  Water                               14.5
                                     -----
                                     100.0


[Footnote A: There is 2.5 per cent. of fat in barley, and 7 per cent.
of sugar.]

From this analysis we can judge that barley contains all the
constituents of a good food. In it we find casin and albumen for our
muscles; starch, sugar, and fat to keep us warm and give force; and
there is a fair percentage of mineral matter for our bones and teeth.

Allinson's prepared barley may be eaten as porridge or pudding (see
directions), and is much more nourishing than rice pudding; it is also
good for adding to broth or soup, and to vegetable stews, and is most
useful for making gruel and barley water. Barley water contains a
great deal of nourishment, more than beef tea, and it can be drunk as
a change from tea, coffee, and cocoa. During illness I advise and use
barley water and milk, mixed in equal parts, and find this mixture
invaluable.


BARLEY FOR BABIES.

Put 1 teaspoonful of Allinson's barley into a breakfast cup; mix this
perfectly smooth with cold milk and cold water in equal parts, until
the cup is full. Pour into a saucepan and bring to the boil, stirring
all the time to prevent it getting lumpy.


BARLEY GRUEL.

Mix 1 large tablespoonful of Allinson's barley with a little cold
water, add to this 1 pint of boiling milk and water, boil together a
few minutes, take from the fire, let cool, then eat. A little nutmeg
gives a pleasant flavour.


BARLEY FOR INVALIDS AND ADULTS.

Use 3 teaspoonfuls of Allinson's barley to 1/2 pint of milk and water,
and prepare as "Barley for Babies."


BARLEY JELLY.

Wash, then steep, 6 oz. of pearl barley for 6 hours, pour 31/2 pints
of boiling water upon it, stew it quickly in a covered jar in a hot
oven till perfectly soft and the water absorbed. When half done, add 6
oz. of sugar and a few drops of essence of lemon. 21/2 hours is the
correct time for stewing the barley, and it is then a better colour
than if longer in preparation. Pour it into a mould to set.


BARLEY PORRIDGE.

Take 3 tablespoonfuls of Allinson's barley, mix smoothly with 1/2 pint
of cold water, add 1/2 pint of boiling milk, and boil 5 to 10 minutes.
Pour on shallow plates to cool, then eat with Allinson wholemeal
bread, biscuits, rusks, or toast, or stewed fruits.


BARLEY PUDDINGS.

Take 2 tablespoonfuls of Allinson's barley, mix smoothly with a little
milk, pour upon it the remainder of 1 pint of milk, flavour and
sweeten to taste, boil 2 or 3 minutes, then add 2 eggs lightly beaten,
pour into a pie-dish, and bake to a golden brown. Eat with stewed,
fresh, or dried fruits.


BARLEY WATER.

Mix smoothly 2 tablespoonfuls of Allinson's barley with a little cold
water, then add it to 1 quart of water in a saucepan, and bring to the
boil. Pour into a jug, and when cool add the juice of 1 or 2 oranges
or lemons. A little sugar may be added when permissible.


BLACK CURRANT TEA.

1 large tablespoonful of black currant jam, 1 pint boiling water. Stir
well together, strain when cold, and serve with a little crushed ice
if allowed.


BRAN TEA.

Mix 1 oz. of bran with 1 pint of water, boil for 1/2 hour, strain, and
drink cool. A little orange or lemon juice is a pleasant addition.
When this is used as a drink at breakfast or tea, a little sugar may
be added to it.


BRUNAK.

Take 1-1/2 or 2 teaspoonfuls of Brunak for each large cupful required,
mix it with sufficient water, and boil for 2 or 3 minutes to get the
full flavour, then strain and add hot milk and sugar to taste. Can be
made in a coffee-pot, teapot, or jug if preferred. May be stood on the
hob to draw; or if you have any left over from a previous meal it can
be boiled up again and served as freshly made.


COCOA.

Put 1 teaspoonful of N.F. cocoa into a breakfast cup; make into a
paste with a little cold milk. Fill the cup with milk and water in
equal parts, pour into lined saucepan, and boil for 1 minute, stirring
carefully. This is best without sugar, and should be given cool.


LEMON WATER.

Squeeze the juice of 1/2 a Lemon into a tumbler of warm or cold water;
add just sufficient sugar to take off the tartness. Or the lemon may
be peeled first, then cut in slices, and boiling water poured over
them; a little of the peel grated in, and sugar added to taste.


OATMEAL PORRIDGE.

Most people, I think, may know how to make porridge; but it is useful
to know that if you take 1 pint of water to each heaped-up
breakfastcupful of Allinson breakfast oats, you have just the amount
of water for a fairly firm porridge. When the water has boiled, and
you have stirred in the oats, place the saucepan on the side of the
stove on an asbestos mat. Only an occasional stirring will be
required, and there is no fear of burning the porridge. If the
porridge is preferred thinner, 1 even cupful to 1 pint of water will
be found the proportion.


OATMEAL WATER.

This is very useful in cases of illness, and is a most pleasant drink
in hot weather, when it can be flavoured with lemon juice and
sweetened a little. To 1 quart of water take 3 oz. of coarse oatmeal
or Allinson breakfast oats. Let it simmer gently on the stove for
about 2 hours. Then rub it through a fine sieve or gravy strainer; rub
it well through, adding a little more hot water when rubbed dry, so as
to get all the goodness out of the oatmeal. If it is thick when it has
been rubbed through sufficiently, thin it down with water or hot
milk--half oatmeal water and half milk is a good mixture. Nothing
better can be given to adults or children in cases of colds or
feverish attacks. It is nourishing and soothing, and in cases of
diarrhoea remedial.


RICE PUDDING.

Wash the rice, put it into a pie-dish, cover with cold water, and bake
until the rice is nearly soft throughout. Beat up 1 egg with milk, mix
with this a little cinnamon or other flavouring, and pour it over the
rice; add sugar to taste, and bake until set.

Sago, tapioca, semolina, and hominy puddings are made after the manner
of rice pudding.




DR. ALLINSON'S NATURAL FOOD


FOR BABIES.

(_To Prepare the Food_.)

Put 1 teaspoonful of the food into a breakfast cup; mix this perfectly
smooth with 2 parts milk to 1 of water until the cup is full. Pour
into a saucepan and bring to the boil, stirring all the time to
prevent it getting lumpy. It is best without sugar, and should be
given cool.


FOR INVALIDS AND ADULTS.

Use 3 teaspoonfuls of the food to 1/2 a pint of milk and water, and
prepare as above.


BLANCMANGE.

Mix 6 large tablespoonfuls of the food to a thin paste with a little
cold milk, then add 1 quart of milk, flavour with vanilla, lemon or
almonds, sweeten to taste; boil 2 or 3 minutes, and pour into wetted
mould. Eat with stewed, fresh, or dried fruits, and you have a most
nutritious and satisfying dish.


GRUEL.

Mix 1 large tablespoonful of the food with a little cold water, add to
this 1 pint of boiling milk and water, boil together a few minutes,
take from the fire, let cool, and then eat. A little nutmeg gives a
pleasant flavour.


IMPROVED MILK PUDDINGS.

Mix 1 tablespoonful of the food with 1 of rice, sago, tapioca, or
hominy, and make as above.

N.B.--The food nicely thickens soups, gravies, &c.


PORRIDGE.

Take 3 tablespoonfuls of the food, mix smoothly, with 1/2 pint of cold
water, add 1/2 pint boiling milk, and boil 5 or 10 minutes. Pour on
shallow plates to cool, then eat with Allinson wholemeal bread,
biscuits, rusks, toast, or stewed fruits.


PUDDINGS.

Take 2 tablespoonfuls of the food, mix smoothly with a little milk,
pour upon it the remainder of 1 pint of milk, flavour and sweeten to
taste; boil 2 or 3 minutes, then add 2 eggs lightly beaten, pour into
a pie-dish, and bake to a golden brown. Eat with stewed, fresh, or
dried fruits.




WHOLESOME COOKERY


I.

BREAKFASTS.


As breakfast is the first meal of the day, it must vary in quantity
and quality according to the work afterwards to be done. The literary
man will best be suited with a light meal, whilst those engaged in
hard work will require a heavier one. The clerk, student, business
man, or professional man, will find one of the three following
breakfasts to suit him well:--

No. I.--Allinson wholemeal bread, 6 to 8 oz., cut thick, with a scrape
of butter; with this take from 6 to 8 oz. of ripe, raw fruit, or
seasonable green stuff; at the end of the meal have a cup of cool,
thin, and not too sweet cocoa, or Brunak, or a cup of cool milk and
water, bran tea, or even a cup of water that has been boiled and
allowed to go nearly cold. An egg may be taken at this meal by those
luxuriously inclined, and if not of a costive habit. The fruits
allowed are all the seasonable ones, or dried prunes if there is a
tendency to constipation. The green stuffs include watercress,
tomatoes, celery, cucumber, and salads. Lettuce must be eaten
sparingly at this meal, as it causes a sleepy feeling. Sugar must be
used in strict moderation; jam, or fruits stewed with much sugar must
be avoided, as they cause mental confusion and disinclination for
brain work.

No. II.--3 to 4 oz. of Allinson wholemeal or crushed wheat, coarse
oatmeal or groats, hominy, maize or barley meal may be boiled for 1/2
an hour with milk and water, a very little salt being taken by those
who use it. When ready, the porridge should be poured upon platters or
soup-plates, allowed to cool, and then eaten with bread. Stewed fruits
may be eaten with the porridge, or fresh fruit may be taken
afterwards. When porridge is made with water, and then eaten with
milk, too much fluid enters the stomach, digestion is delayed, and
waterbrash frequently occurs. Meals absorb at least thrice their
weight of water in cooking, so that 4 oz. of meal will make at least
16 oz. of porridge. Sugar, syrup, treacle, or molasses should not be
eaten with porridge, as they are apt to cause acid risings in the
mouth, heartburn, and flatulence. In summer, wholemeal and barleymeal
make the best porridges, and they may be taken cold; in autumn,
winter, and early spring, oatmeal or hominy are the best, and may be
eaten lukewarm. When porridges are eaten, no other course should be
taken afterwards, but the entire meal should be made of porridge,
bread, and fruit. Neither cocoa nor any other fluids should be taken
after a porridge meal, or the stomach becomes filled with too much
liquid, and indigestion results. To make the best flavoured porridge,
the coarse meal or crushed grain should be stewed in the oven for an
hour or two; it may be made the day before it is required, and just
warmed through before being brought to the table. This may be eaten
with Allinson wholemeal bread and a small quantity of milk, or fresh
or stewed fruit.

No. III.--Cut 4 to 6 oz. of Allinson wholemeal bread into dice, put
into a basin, and pour over about 1/2 a pint of boiling milk, or milk
and water; cover the basin with a plate, let it stand ten minutes, and
then eat slowly. Sugar or salt should not be added to the bread and
milk. An apple, pear, orange, grapes, banana, or other seasonable
fruit may be eaten afterwards. No other foods should be eaten at this
meal, but only the bread, milk, and fruit.

Labourers, artisans, and those engaged in hard physical work may take
any of the above breakfasts. If they take No. I., they may allow
themselves from 8 to 10 oz. of bread, and should drink a large cup of
Brunak afterwards, as their work requires a fair amount of liquid to
carry off some of the heat caused by the burning up of food whilst
they are at work. If No. II. breakfast is taken, 6 to 8 oz. of meal
may be allowed. If No. III. breakfast is eaten, then 6 or 8 oz. of
bread and 2 pint of milk may be taken.

N.B.--Women require about a quarter less food than men do, and must
arrange the quantity accordingly.




II.

MIDDAY MEALS.


The meal in the middle of the day must vary according to the work to
be done after it. If much mental strain has to be borne or business
done, the meal must be a light one, and should be lunch rather than
dinner. Those engaged in hard physical work should make their chief
meal about midday, and have a light repast in the evening.

LUNCH.--One of the simplest lunches is that composed of Allinson
wholemeal bread and fruit. From 6 to 8 oz. of bread may be eaten, and
about 1/2 lb. of any raw fruit that is in season; afterwards a glass
of lemon water or bran tea, Brunak, or a cup of thin, cool, and not
too sweet cocoa may be taken, or a tumbler of milk and water slowly
sipped. The fruit may be advantageously replaced by a salad, which is
a pleasant change from fruit, and sits as lightly on the stomach.
Wholemeal biscuits and fruit, with a cup of fluid, form another good
lunch. A basin of any kind of porridge with milk, but without sugar,
also makes a light and good midday repast; or a basin of thin
vegetable soup and bread, or macaroni, or even plain vegetables. The
best lunch of all will be found in Allinson wholemeal bread, and salad
or fruit, as it is not wise to burden the system with too much cooked
food, and one never feels so light after made dishes as after bread
and fruit.

Labouring men who wish to take something with them to work will find
12 oz. of Allinson wholemeal bread, 1/2 lb. fresh fruit, and a large
mug of Brunak or cocoa satisfy them well; or instead of cocoa they may
have milk and water, lemon water, lemonade, oatmeal water, or some
harmless non-alcoholic drink. Another good meal is made from 1/2 lb.
of the wholemeal bread and butter, and a 1/4 lb. of peas pudding
spread between the slices. The peas can be flavoured with a little
pepper, salt, and mustard by those who still cling to condiments. 12
oz. of the wholemeal bread, 2 or 3 oz. of cheese, some raw fruit, or
an onion, celery, watercress, or other greenstuff, with a large cup of
fluid, form another good meal. 1/2 lb. of coarse oatmeal or crushed
wheat made into porridge the day before, and warmed up at midday, will
last a man well until he gets home at night. Or a boiled bread pudding
may be taken to work, warmed and eaten. This is made from the
wholemeal bread, which is soaked in hot water until soft, then crushed
or crumbled, some currants or raisins are then mixed with this, a
little soaked sago stirred in; lastly, a very little sugar and spice
are added as a flavouring. This mixture is then tied up in a pudding
cloth and boiled, or it may be put in a pudding basin covered with a
cloth, and boiled in a saucepan. A pleasing addition to this pudding
is some finely chopped almonds, or Brazil nuts.




III.

DINNERS.


As dinner is the chief meal of the day it should consist of
substantial food. It may be taken in the middle of the day by those
who work hard; but if taken at night, at least five hours must elapse
before going to bed, so that the stomach may have done its work before
sleep comes on.

A dinner may consist of many courses or different dishes, but the
simpler the dishes and the less numerous the courses the better. A
person who makes his meal from one dish only is the wisest of all. He
who limits himself to two courses does well, but he who takes more
than three courses lays up for himself stomach troubles or disorder of
the system. When only one course is had, then good solid food must be
eaten; when two courses are the rule, a moderate amount of each should
be taken; and it three different dishes are provided, a
proportionately lighter quantity of each. Various dishes may be served
for the dinner meal, such as soups, omelettes, savouries, pies,
batters, and sweet courses.

The plainest dinner any one can eat is that composed of Allinson
wholemeal bread and raw fruit. A man in full work may eat from 12 to
16 oz. of the wholemeal bread, and about the same quantity of ripe raw
fruit. The bread is best dry, the next best is when a thin scrape of
butter is spread on it. If hard physical work has to be done, a cup of
Brunak, cocoa, milk and water, or lemon water, should be drunk at the
end of the meal. In winter these fluids might be taken warmed, but in
summer they are best cool or cold. This wholesome fare can be varied
in a variety of ways; some might like a salad instead of the fruit,
and others may prefer cold vegetables. A few Brazil nuts, almonds,
walnuts, some Spanish nuts, or a piece of cocoanut may be eaten with
the bread in winter. Others not subject to piles, constipation, or
eczema, &c., may take 2 oz. of cheese and an onion with their bread,
or a hard-boiled egg. This simple meal can be easily carried to work,
or on a journey. Wholemeal biscuits or Allinson rusks may be used
instead of bread if one is on a walking tour, cycling trip, or boating
excursion, or even on ordinary occasions for a change.

Of cooked dinners, the simplest is that composed of potatoes baked,
steamed, or boiled in their skins, eaten with another vegetable,
sauce, and the wholemeal bread. Baked potatoes are the most wholesome,
and their skins should always be eaten; steamed potatoes are next;
whilst boiled ones, especially if peeled, are not nearly so good. Any
seasonable vegetable may be steamed and eaten with the potatoes, such
as cauliflower, cabbage, sprouts, broccoli, carrot, turnip, beetroot,
parsnips, or boiled celery, or onions. Recipes for the sauces used
with this course will be found in another part of the book; they may
be parsley, onion, caper, tomato, or brown gravy sauce. This dinner
may be varied by adding to it a poached, fried, or boiled egg. As a
second course, baked apples, or stewed fresh fruit and bread may be
eaten; or Allinson bread pudding, or rice, sago, tapioca, or macaroni
pudding with stewed fruit. Persons troubled with piles, varicose
veins, varicocele, or constipation must avoid this dinner as much as
possible. If they do eat it they must be sure to eat the skins of the
potatoes, and take the Allinson bread pudding or bread and fruit
afterwards, avoiding puddings of rice, sago, tapioca, or macaroni.




IV.

EVENING MEAL.


Evening meal or tea meal should be the last meal at which solid food
is eaten. It should always be a light one, and the later it is eaten
the less substantial it should be. Heavy or hard work after tea is no
excuse for a supper. This meal must be taken at least three hours
before retiring. From 4 to 6 oz. of Allinson wholemeal bread may be
allowed with a poached or lightly boiled egg, a salad, or fruit, or
some kind of green food. The fluid drunk may be Brunak, cocoa, milk
and water, bran tea, or even plain water, boiled and taken cool. Those
who are restless at night, nervous, or sleepless must not drink tea at
this meal. Fruit in the evening is not considered good, and when taken
it should be cooked rather than raw. Boiled celery will be found to be
lighter on the stomach at this meal than the raw vegetable. When it is
boiled, as little water as possible should be used; the water that the
celery is boiled in may be thickened with Allinson fine wheatmeal,
made into sauce, and poured over the cooked celery; by this means we
do not loose the valuable salts dissolved out of the food by boiling.
Mustard and cress, watercress, radishes, and spring onions may be
eaten if the evening meal is taken 4 or 5 hours before going to bed.
Those who are away from home all day, and who take their food to their
work may have some kind of milk pudding at this meal. Wheatmeal
blancmange, or cold milk pudding may occasionally be eaten those who
are costive will find a boiled onion or some braized onions very
useful. Boil the onion in as little water as possible and serve up
with the liquor it is boiled in. To prepare braized onions, fry them
first until nicely brown, using butter or olive oil, then add a cupful
of boiling water to the contents of the frying pan, cover with a
plate, and let cook for an hour. This is not really a rich food, but
one easy of digestion and of great use to the sleepless. Those who
want to rise early must make their last meal a light one. Those
troubled with dreams or restlessness must do the same. Very little
fluid should be taken last thing at night, as it causes persons to
rise frequently to empty the bladder.




V.

SUPPERS.


Hygienic livers will never take such meals, even if tea has been
early, or hard work done since the tea meal was taken. No solid food
must be eaten. The most that should be consumed is a cup of Brunak,
cocoa, lemon water, bran tea, or even boiled water, but never milk. In
winter warm drinks may be taken, and in summer cool ones.




VI.

DRINKS.


LEMON WATER is made by squeezing the juice of 1/2 a lemon into a
tumbler of warm or cold water; to this is added just enough sugar to
take off the tartness. Some peel the lemon first, then cut in slices,
pour boiling water over the slices, grate in a little of the peel, and
add sugar to taste.

BRUNAK.--Take 1-1/2 to 2 teaspoonfuls of Brunak for each large cupful
required, mix it with sufficient water, and boil for 2 or 3 minutes to
get the full flavour, then strain and add hot milk and sugar to taste.
Can be made in a coffee-pot, teapot, or jug if preferred. May be stood
on the hob to draw; or it you have any left over from a previous meal
it can be boiled up again and served as freshly made.

COCOA.--This is best made by putting a teaspoonful of any good cocoa,
such as Allinson's, into a breakfast cup; boiling water is then poured
upon this and stirred; 1 tablespoonful of milk must be added to each
cup, and 1 teaspoonful of sugar where sugar is used, or 1 or 2
teaspoonfuls of condensed milk and no extra sugar.

BRAN TEA.--Mix 1 oz. of bran with 1 pint of water; boil for 1/2 an
hour, strain, and drink cool. A little orange or lemon juice is a
pleasant addition. When this is used as a drink at breakfast or tea, a
little milk and sugar may be added to it.

CHOCOLATE.--Allow 1 bar of Allinson's chocolate for each cup of fluid.
Break the chocolate in bits, put into a saucepan, add a little boiling
water, put on the fire, and stir until the chocolate is dissolved,
then add rest of fluid and boil 2 or 3 minutes. Pour the chocolate
into cups, and add about 1 tablespoonful of fresh milk to each cup,
but no extra sugar. The milk may be added to the chocolate whilst
boiling, if desired.




WHOLEMEAL COOKERY


Most of my readers have received great benefit from eating wholemeal
bread instead of white, and they may all gain further good it they
will use Allinson wholemeal flour in place of white for all cooking
purposes. Those who are at all constipated, or who suffer from piles,
varicose veins, varicocele, back pain, &c., should never use white
flour in cooking. Those who are inclined to stoutness should use
wholemeal flour rather than white. Hygienists and health-reformers
should not permit white flour to enter their houses, unless it is to
make bill-stickers' paste or some like stuff. Toothless children must
not be given any food but milk and water until they cut at least two
teeth.

Every kind of cookery can be done with wholemeal flour. In making
ordinary white sauce or vegetable sauce, this is how we make it; Chop
fine some onion or parsley; boil in a small quantity of water, stir in
wholemeal flour and milk, add a little pepper and salt, thin with hot
water, and thus produce a sauce that helps down vegetables and
potatoes. In making a brown sauce we put a little butter or olive oil
in the frying-pan; let it bubble and sputter, dredge in Allinson
wholemeal flour, stir it round with a knife until browned, add boiling
water, pepper, salt, a little ketchup, and you then have a nice brown
sauce for many dishes. If we wish to make it very tasty we fry a
finely chopped onion first and add that to it. White sweet sauce is
made from wholemeal flour, milk, sugar, and a little cinnamon, cloves,
lemon juice, vanilla, or other flavouring. Yorkshire puddings, Norfolk
dumplings, batter puddings, and such puddings can all be made with
wholemeal flour, and are more nourishing and healthy, and do not lie
so heavy as those made from white flour. Pancakes can be made from
wholemeal flour just as well as from white.

All kinds of pastry, pie-crusts, under crusts, &c., are best made from
Allinson wholemeal, and if much butter, lard, or dripping is used they
will lie just as heavy, and cause heartburn just as much as those made
with white flour. There is a substitute for pie-crusts that is very
tasty, and not at all harmful. We call it "batter," and it can be used
for savoury dishes as well as sweet ones.


SAVOURY DISHES MADE WITH BATTER.

Fry some potatoes, then some onions, put them in layers in a pie-dish;
next make a batter of Allinson wholemeal flour, 1 or 2 eggs, milk, and
a little pepper with salt; pour over the fried vegetables as they lie
in the dish, bake in the oven from 1/2 an hour to 1 hour, until, in
fact, the batter has formed a crust; eat with the usual vegetables. Or
chop fine cold vegetables of any kind, fry onions and add to them, put
in a pie-dish, pour some of the batter as above over them, and bake.
All kinds of cold vegetables, cold soup, porridge, &c., can go into
this, and tinned or fresh tomatoes will make it more savoury. Tomatoes
may be wiped, put in a pie-dish, batter poured over, and then baked,
and are very tasty this way. Butter adds to the flavour of these
dishes, but does not make them more wholesome or more nourishing.


STEWED FRUIT PUDDING.

Cut Allinson wholemeal bread into slices a little over a 1/4 of an
inch thick, line a pie-dish with these, having first cut off the hard
crusts. Then fill the dish with hot stewed fruit of any kind, and at
once cover it with a layer of bread, gently pressed on the hot fruit.
Turn out when cold on to a flat dish, pour over it a white sauce, and
serve.


SUBSTANTIAL BREAD PUDDINGS.

Soak crusts or slices of Allinson bread in hot water, then break fine
in a pie-dish, add to this soaked currants, raisins, chopped nuts or
almonds, a beaten-up egg, and milk, with sugar and spice, and bake in
the oven. Or tie the whole up in a pudding-cloth and boil. Serve with
white sauce or eat with stewed fresh fruit. These puddings can be
eaten hot or cold; labourers can take them to their work for dinner,
and their children cannot have a better meal to take to school.


SWEET BATTER.

Mix Allinson wholemeal flour, milk, 1 or 2 eggs together, and a little
sugar and cinnamon, and it is ready for use. Stew ripe cherries,
gooseberries, currants, raspberries, plums, damsons, or other ripe
fruit in a jar, pour into a pie-dish; pour into the batter named
above, bake, and this is a good substitute for a fruit pie. Prunes can
be treated the same way, or the batter can be cooked in the saucepan,
poured into a mould, allowed to go cold and set; then it forms
wholemeal blancmange, and may be eaten with stewed fresh fruit. Rusks,
cheesecakes, buns, biscuits, and other like articles as Madeira cake,
pound cake, wedding cake, &c., can all be made of wholemeal flour.


WHOLEMEAL SOUP.

Chop fine any kinds of greens or vegetables, stew in a little water
until thoroughly done, then add plenty of hot water, with pepper and
salt to taste, and a 1/4 of an hour before serving, pour in a cupful
of the "Sweet Batter," and you get a thick, nourishing soup. To make
it more savoury, fry your vegetables before making into soup.

The PERFECT BREAD


The Perfect Bread and the Perfect _Food_ is the best description of
Allinson Wholemeal Bread, which combines the maximum of nutriment at a
minimum cost. Other essentials of perfection are amply proved by the
following facts:--

Palatability. Allinson Bread retains to the full the delicious
flavour of fresh-gleaned wheat.

Nourishment. Containing the whole of the grain, it consistently
affords that 100% of Brain, Bone and Muscle building qualities
provided by unadulterated wheat.

--Which wheat is so scientifically cleaned and ground by a patented
stone mill process that Allinson Bread is perfectly digestible under
all conditions.

Economy. In view of recent advice tendered by the Government on food
economy, the _Fact_ that a 2 lb. (approx.) Allinson loaf contains as
much real nutriment as a pound of beef (costing nearly three times as
much) is a point of economy that none can afford to overlook.

[Illustration: ALLINSON Bread]

Apart from the questions of economy and nourishment, Allinson
Wholemeal Bread is undoubtedly the ideal diet when eaten with fresh
fruit or salads.

In Addition, Allinson Bread is unique as the health-maintaining diet
because it retains those essentials of the wheat expressly designed by
Nature as a Natural and all sufficient corrective.

..FLOUR..


Allinson Gold Medal Wholemeal Flour has been rightly termed the
"Flour of Health." The importance of pure unadulterated flour for
domestic cookery cannot be exaggerated, and of the purity and
nutritive quality of _Allinson_ there is no question.

It contains the full 100% nourishment of unadulterated wheat in a form
so perfectly digestible that it is the ideal flour for all possible
Baking purposes. Many people who wisely use Wholemeal Flour for baking
bread fail to realize that it can be used with equal success when
making puddings, cakes, and pastry, giving to each extra nourishment
and retaining all the delicious flavour of fresh-gleaned wheat.

MONTHLY COMPETITION.

L20 Monthly Prize Scheme.

The Proprietors of Allinson Gold Medal Wholemeal Flour, realizing the

The Allinson NATURAL FOOD for Babies & Invalids

A Note by Dr. ALLINSON, Ex-L.R.C.P, Edin.


No artificial food, nor the milk of any other animal, is equal to a
mother's milk. Usually the milk of the cow is given as a substitute
for mother's milk. It takes the place of mother's milk fairly well,
but it has its drawbacks, the chief one is that it curdles in heavy
cheese-like masses, which lie heavy on the stomach, are long in
digesting, and cause discomfort. The aim of the scientific and
practical physician is to prevent this heavy curdling while allowing
cow's milk to be taken.

Some Doctors Advise lime water to be added to the milk; this causes
the milk to curdle in flakes, but it hinders digestion, gives rise to
constipation, and may lead to stone in the bladder. Some advise
barley, wheat, oatmeal or rice Water, etc., to be added to the cow's
milk. These often answer the purpose, but they have their drawbacks.
They all are a trouble to make; barley and rice water are
constipating, and oatmeal water is heating.

Knowing these Drawbacks I invented Natural Food. This, when added to
cow's milk, will prevent it curdling in heavy masses, is easily
prepared, and besides this, it contains all that the growing baby
needs, and thus is a valuable addition to the milk; it nourishes all
the organs but clogs none. Nine-tenths of the foods made for babies
are made on wrong lines. They either contain too much sugar, or they
are too starchy, or they are deficient in bone-forming materials, or
in laxative principles, or else they contain injurious chemicals.

When Inventing Natural Food I tried to overcome every obstacle and
make it the best Food for infants in the market; the success that has
followed its use justifies me in saying that it is second to none. I
am a practical physician, and it is my boast that I rarely lose a
child in illness, and when babies are reared as I advise they are
usually the admiration of all, and live to be a source of delight to
their parents.

This is the Way to prepare the food for babies. One part of water is
added to two parts of fresh milk, and to each half-pint of this
mixture is added a fairly heaped-up teaspoonful of Natural Food; mix
well, put on the fire, bring to the boil, and when cool the food is
ready. All food should be given cool, or not warmer than the
temperature of the human blood. In place of a thermometer, the tip of
the little finger is a good tester; if the food does not feel hot to
this test it will be of the right temperature. Sugar should not be
added to the food, nor should tinned or condensed milk be ordinarily
used. Only under exceptional circumstances should tinned milk be used,
as on board ship, or when fresh milk cannot be had. Also quite as
invaluable for nursing mothers and invalids.

"POWER"

THE IDEAL BREAKFAST FOOD


Mankind is eternally searching for the best form of food. The rational
man wants something that will satisfy the cravings of hunger, be
tasty, nourish every organ and tissue of the body, and not be too
bulky. We have many foods that will fulfil one or two of these
conditions, but it is rare to find all combined in one, as in "Power."
Power is pleasant to the taste--nutritious and most _sustaining_. It
contains everything necessary for supporting the human frame. It
combines proteid elements for building up the muscles; hydro-carbons
and carbo-hydrates for heating the body and suppyling the requisite
energy for work; mineral matters for bone and teeth; and lastly, a
certain amount of "filling" material to occupy the stomach and bowels,
cause daily laxation, and so carry away the bile and various other
digestive juices, the retention of which means disease.

[Illustration: Dr. ALLINSON says: "POWER" is The Food]

It is made in the form of crisp pellets, gives exercise to the teeth,
keeps them in good order, and stimulates the salivary glands. Further,
Power is a Natural Corrective of inestimable worth. It may form the
correct diet for young children and the aged. It is perfectly
digestible and will prove a tower of strength and a standby under all
conditions of life and work.

BRUNAK

_The HEALTH BEVERAGE_

COCOA, and as harmless as WATER. Is as easily made as either of them,
and can be taken at any meal or at supper-time. There is not a
headache in a barrel of it, and no nervousness in a ton of it. May be
drunk by young and old, weak and strong, the brainy man and the
athlete; also by invalids, even in diabetes."

[Illustration]

Wakefulness, Loss of Memory, Low Spirits, Flushing, Trembling, and all
who cannot or should not take tea, coffee, or cocoa, may take BRUNAK

_The Allinson_ VEGEBUTTER


Not only Vegetarians but many others agree that the Allinson
Vegebutter is the ideal fat for cooking purposes.

It does not contain animal fat whatever, being a pure vegetable
product both healthful and economical. It is never rancid and is far
more digestible than Cow Butter or any other animal Fat. For cooking
and frying it is used in the same manner as Butter or Lard. For Pastry
it should be softened slightly before rubbing into the flour, and a
little more water used in making the paste than if Lard or Butter were
being used.

_The Allinson_ Breakfast Oats


The Allinson Breakfast oats are made solely from finest Oats grown in
our own country--and no country can grow Oats equal to ours. Being
steam-cooked by a patented process, perfectly digestible, and
thoroughly relished by men, women, and children alike, always retain
the same delicious flavour. Equally suited to rich or poor, produce
healthy skins, good complexions, and form bone and muscle. One pound
weight will go as far as three pounds of butcher's meat, and not cost
one-sixth of the price.

the value of them. All may use these foods with benefit, and two
dinners each week of them with wholemeal bread will prevent many a
serious illness. They are natural food in a plain state, and supply
the system with vegetable salts and acids in the best form. Salads
should be eaten with wholemeal bread, and the QUANTITY OF OIL SHOULD
BE ABOUT THREE TIMES THE AMOUNT OF THE VINEGAR USED."

and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
