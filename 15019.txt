A QUEENS DELIGHT OF Conserves, and Preserves, Candying and Distilling
Waters.



_To preserve white Pear Plums, or green._


Take the Plums, and cut the stalk off, and wipe them then take the just
weight of them in Sugar, then put them in a skillet of water, and let
them stand in and scald, being close covered till they be tender, they
must not seeth, when they be soft lay them in a Dish, and cover them
with a cloth, and stew some of the the Sugar in the glass bottom, and
put in the Plums, strewing the sugar over till all be in, then let them
stand all night, the next day put them in a pan, and let them boil a
pace, keeping them clean scummed, & when your Plums look clear, your
syrup will gelly, and they are enough. If your Plums be ripe, peel off
the skins before you put them in the glass; they will be the better and
clearer a great deal to dry, if you will take the Plums white; if green,
do them with the rinds on.



_To preserve Grapes_

Take Grapes when they be almost through ripe, and cut the stalks off,
and stone them in the side, and as fast as you can stone them strew
Sugar on them; you must take to every pound of Grapes three quarters of
a pound of Sugar, then take some of the sower Grapes; and wring the
juyce of them, and put to every pound of Grapes two spoonfuls of juyce,
then set them on the fire, and still lift up the pan and shake it round,
for fear of burning to, then set them on again, & when the Sugar is
melted, boil them as fast as you can possible, and when they look very
clear, and the syrup is somewhat thick, they are enough.



_To preserve Quinces white._

Take a pair and coar them, and to every pound of your equal weights in
Sugar and Quince, take a wine pint of water; put them together, and boil
them as fast as you can uncovered; and this way you may also preserve
Pippins white as you do Quinces.



_To preserve Respass._

Take a pound of Respass, a pound of fine Sugar, a quarter of a pint of
the juyce of Respass, strew the Sugar under and above the Respass,
sprinkle the juyce all on them, set them on a clear fire, let them boil
as soft as is possible, till the syrup will gelly, then take them off,
let them stand till they be cold, then put them in a glass. After this
manner is the best way.



_To preserve Pippins._

Take fair Pippins, and boil them in fair water till they be somewhat
tender, then take them out, and peel off the skins and put them into a
fair earthen pot, and cover them till they be cold, then make the syrup
with fair water and Sugar, seeth it, and scum it very clean, then being
almost cold, put in your Pippins, so boil them softly together, put in
as much rind of Oranges as you think will tast them, if you have no
Oranges take whole Cinamon and Cloves, so boil them high enough to keep
them all the year.



_To preserve fruits green._

Take Pippins, Apricocks, Pear-Plums, or Peaches when they be green,
scald them in hot water, and peel them or scrape them, put them into
another water not so hot as the first, then boil them very tender, take
the weight of them in Sugar, put to it as much water as will make a
syrup to cover them; then boil them something leisurely, and take them
up, then boil the syrup till it be somewhat thick, that it will batten
on a dish side, and when they are cold, put them together.



_To preserve Oranges and Lemons the best way._

Take and boil them as for paste, then take as much sugar as they weigh,
and put to it as much water as will cover them by making a syrrup, then
boil them very leisurely till they be clear, then take them up and boil
the syrup till it batten on the dish side, and when they are cold put
them up, &c.



_An approved Conserve for a Cough or Consumption of the Lungs._

Take a pound of Elecampane Roots, draw out the pith, and boil them in
two waters till they be soft, when it is cold put to it the like
quantity of the pap of roasted Pippins, and three times their weight of
brown sugar-candy beaten to powder, stamp these in a Mortar to a
Conserve, whereof take every morning fasting as much as a Walnut for a
week or fortnight together, and afterwards but three times a week.
_Approved_.



_To make conserve of Any of these Fruits._

When you have boiled your paste as followeth ready to fashion on the
Pie-plate, put it up into Gallipots, and never dry it, and this is all
the difference between Conserves. And so you may make Conserves of any
Fruits, this is for all hard Fruits, as Quinces, Pippins, Oranges and
Lemons.



_To dry any Fruits after they are preserved, to or Candy them._

Take Pippins, Pears or Plums, and wash them out in warm water from the
syrup they are preserved in, strew them over with searsed Sugar, as you
would do flower upon fish to fry them; set them in a broad earthen Pan,
that they may lie one by one; then set them in a warm Oven or Stove to
dry. If you will candy them withall, you must strew on Sugar three or
four times in the drying.



_To preserve Artichokes young, green Walnuts and Lemons, and the
Elecampane-Roots, or any bitter thing._

Take any of these, and boil them tender, and shift them in their boyling
six or seven times to take away their bitterness out of one hot water
into another, then put a quart of Salt unto them, then take them up and
dry them with a fair cloth, then put them into as much clarified Sugar
as will cover them, then let them boil a walm or two, and so let them
stand soaking in the Sugar till the next morning, then take them up and
boil the Sugar a little higher by it self, and when they are cold put
them up.

Let your green Walnuts be prickt full of holes with a great pin, and let
them not be long in one water, for that will make them look black; being
boiled tender, stick two or three Cloves in each of them.

Set your Elecampane-Roots, being clean scraped, and shifted in their
boilings a dozen times, then dry them in a fair cloth, and so boil them
as is above written, take half so much more than it doth weigh, because
it is bitter, &c.



_To preserve Quinces white or red._

Take the Quinces, and coar them, and pare them, those that you will have
white, put them into a pail of water two or three hours, then take as
much Sugar as they weigh, put to it as much water as will make a Syrup
to cover them, then boil your Syrup a little while, then put your
Quinces in, and boil them as fast as you can, till they be tender and
clear, then take them up, and boil the Syrup a little higher by it self,
and being cold put them up. And if you will have them red, put them raw
into Sugar, and boil them leisurely close covered till they be red and
put them not into cold water.



_To preserve Grapes._

Take the Clusters, and stone them as you do Barberries, then take a
little more Sugar than they weigh, put to it as much Apple water as will
make a Syrup to cover them, then boil them as you do Cherries as fast as
you can, till the Syrup be thick and being cold pot it, thus may you
preserve Barberries or English Currans, or any kind of Berries.



_To preserve Pippins, Apricoks, Pear-Plums and Peaches when they are
ripe._

Take Pippins and pare them, bore a hole through them, & put them into a
Pail of water, then take as much Sugar as they do weigh, and put to it
as much water as will make a Syrup to cover them, and boil them as fast
as you can, so that you keep them from breaking, until they be tender,
that you may prick a Rush through them: let them be a soaking till they
be almost cold, then put them up.

Your Apricoks and Peaches must be stoned & pared, but the Pear-Plums
must not be stoned nor pared. Then take a little more Sugar than they
weigh, then take as much Apple water and Sugar as will make a Syrup for
them, then boil them as you do your Pippins, and Pot them as you do the
Pippins likewise, &c.



_To preserve Pippins, Apricocks, Pear-Plums, or Peaches green._

Take your Pippins green and quoddle them in fair water, but let the
water boil first before you put them in, & you must shift them in two
hot waters before they will be tender, then pull off the skin from them,
and so case them in so much clarified Sugar as will cover them, and so
boil them as fast as you can, keeping them from breaking, then take them
up, and boil the syrup until it be as thick as for Quiddony; then pot
them, and pour the syrup into them before they be cold.

Take your Apricocks and Pear-Plums and boil them tender, then take as
much Sugar as they do weigh, and take as much water as will make the
syrup, take your green Peaches before they be stoned and thrust a pin
through them, and then make a strong water of ashes, and cast them into
the hot standing lye to take off the fur from them, then wash them in
three or four waters warm, so then put them into so much clarified Sugar
as will candy them; so boil them, and put them up, &c.



_To dry Pippins, or Pears without Sugar._

Take Pippins or Pears and prick them full of holes with a bodkin, & lay
them in sweet wort three or four dayes, then lay them on a sieves
bottom, till they be dry in an Oven, but a drying heat. This you may do
to any tender Plum.



_To make Syrup of Clove-gilly flowers._

Take a quart of water, half a bushel of Flowers, cut off the whites, and
with a sieve sift away the seeds, bruise them a little; let your water
be boiled, and a little cold again, then put in your Flowers, and let
them stand close covered twenty four hours; you may put in but half the
flowers at a time, the strength will come out the better; to that liquor
put in four pound of Sugar, let it lye in all night, next day boil it in
a Gallipot, set it in a pot of water, and there let it boil till all the
Sugar be melted and the syrup be pretty thick, then take it out, and let
it stand in that till it be through cold, then glass it.



_To make Syrup of Hysop for Colds._

Take a handful of Hysop, of Figs, Raisins, Dates, of each an ounce, of
Collipint half an handful, French Barley one ounce, boil therein three
pints of fair water to a quart, strain it and clarifie it with two
whites of Eggs, then put in two pound of fine sugar, and boil it to a
syrup.



_To make Orange Water._

Take a pottle of the best Maligo Sack, and put in as many of the peels
of Oranges as will go in, cut the white clean off, let them steep twenty
four hours; still them in a glass still, and let the water run into the
Receiver upon fine Sugar-candy; you may still it in an ordinary Still.



_To dry Cherries._

Take a pound of sugar, dissolve it in thin fair water, when it is boiled
a little while, put in your Cherries after they are stoned, four pound
to one pound of Sugar, let them lye in the Sugar three dayes, then take
them out of the syrup and lay them on sieves one by one, and set them
before the Sun upon stools, turn them every day, else they will mould;
when they look of a dark red colour, and are dry then put them up. And
so you may do any manner of Fruit. In the Sun is the best drying of
them, put into the syrup some juyce of Rasps.



_To make juyce of Liquorish._

Take English Liquorish, and stamp it very clean, bruise it with a
hammer, and cut it in peices; to a pound of Liquorish thus bruised, put
a quart of Hysop water, let them soak together in an earthen pot a day
and a night, then pull the Liquorish into small pieces, and lay it in
soak again two dayes more; then strain out the Liquorish, and boil the
liquor a good while. Stir it often; then put in half a pound of
Sugar-candy, or Loaf-sugar finely beaten, four grains of Musk, as much
Ambergreece, bruise them small with a little Sugar; then boil them
together till it be good & thick, still have care you burn it not; then
put it out in glass plates, and make it into round rolls, and set it in
a drying place till it be stiff, that you may work it into rolls to be
cut as big as Barley corns, and so lay them on a place again: If it be
needful strew on the place again a little Sugar to prevent thickning; so
dry them still if there be need and if they should be too dry, the heat
of the fire will soften them again.



_A Perfume for Cloths, Gloves._

Take of Linet two grains, of Musk three, of Ambergreece four, and the
oyl of Bems a pretty quantity; grinde them all upon a Marble stone fit
for that purpose; then with a brush or sponge rake them over, and it
will sweeten them very well; your Gloves or Jerkins must first be washed
in red Rose-water, and when they are almost dry, stretch them forth
smooth, and lay on the Perfumes.



_To make Almond Bisket._

Take the whites of four new laid Eggs, and two yolks, then beat it well
for an hour together, then have in readiness a quarter of a pound of the
best Almonds blanched in cold water, & beat them very small with
Bose-wart, for fear of Oyling; then, have a pound of the best Loaf-sugar
finely beaten, beat that in the Eggs a while, then put in your Almonds,
and five or six spoonfuls of the finest flower, and so bake them
together upon Paper plates, you may have a little fine Sugar in a piece
of tiffany to dust them over as they be in the Oven, so bake them as you
do Bisket.



_To dry Apricocks._

First stone them, then weigh them, take the weight of them in double
refined Sugar, make the syrup with so much water as will wet them, and
boil it up so high, that a drop being droped on a Plate it will slip
clean off, when it is cold, put in your Apricocks being pared, whilst
your Syrup is hot, but it must not be taken off the fire before you put
them in, then turn them in the syrup often, then let them stand 3
quarters of an hour, then take them out of the syrup, and tie them up in
Tiffanies, one in a tiffany or more, as they be in bigness, and whilst
you are tying them up, set the syrup on the fire to heat, but not to
boil, then put your Apricocks into the syrup, and set them on a quick
fire, and let them boil, as fast as you can, skim them clean, and when
they look clear take them from the fire, and let them lie in the syrup
till the next day, then set them on the fire to heat, but not to boil;
then set them by till the next day, and lay them upon a clean Sieve to
drain, and when they are well drained, take them out of the Tiffanies,
and so dry them in a Stove, or better in the Sun with Glasses over them,
to keep them from the dust.



_To make Quinces for Pies._

Wipe the Quinces, and put them into a little vessel of swall Beer when
it hath done working; stop them close that no air can get in, and this
will keep them fair all the year and good.



_The best way to break sweet Powder._

Take of Orrice one pound, Calamus a quarter of a pound, Benjamin one
half pound, Storax half a pound, Civet a quarter of an ounce, Cloves a
quarter of a pound, Musk one half ounce, Oyl of Orange flowers one
ounce, Lignum Aloes one ounce, Rosewood a quarter of a pound,
Ambergreece a quarter of an ounces. To every pound of Roses put a pound
of powder; the bag must be of Taffity, or else the powder will run
through.



_To make excellent Perfumes._

Take a quarter of a pound of Damask Rose-buds cut clean from the Whites,
stamp them very small, put to them a good spoonful of Damask Rose-water,
so let them stand close stoopped all night, then take one ounce and a
quarter of Benjamin finely beaten, and also searsed, (if you will)
twenty grains of Civit, and ten grains of Musk; mingle them well
together, then make it up in little Cakes between Rose leaves, and dry
them between sheets of Paper.



_To make Conserve of Roses boiled._

Take a quart of red Rose-water, a quart of fair water, boil in the Water
a pound of red Rose-leaves, the whites cut off, the leaves must be
boiled very tender; then take three pound of Sugar, and put to it a
pound at a time, and let it boil a little between every pound, so put it
up in your pots.



_To make Conserves of Roses unboiled._

Take a pound of red Rose leaves, the whites cut off, stamp them very
fine, take a pound of Sugar, and beat in with the Roses, and put it in a
pot, and cover it with leather, and set it in a cool place.



_To make a very good Pomatum._

Take the Fat of a young Dog one pound, it must be killed well that the
blood settle not into the fat, then let the outer skin be taken off
before it be opened, lest any of the hair come to the fat, then take all
the fat from the inside, and as soon as you take it off fling it into
Conduit water, and if you see the second skin be clear, peel it and
water it with the other: be sure it cools not out of the water: you must
not let any of the flesh remain on it, for then the Pomatum will not
keep. To one pound of this fat take two pound of Lambs caule, and put it
to the other in the water and when you see it is cold, drain it from the
water in a Napkin, and break it in little peices with your fingers, and
take out all the little veins; then take eight ounces of Oyl of Tartar,
and put in that first, stiring it well together, then put it into a
Gallon of Conduit water, and let it stand till night; shift this with so
much Oyl and Water, morning and evening seven dayes together, and be
sure you shift it constantly; and the day before you mean to melt it
wring it hard by a little at a time, and be sure the Oyl and water be
all out of it, wring the water well out of it with a Napkin every time
you shift it; then put in three pints of Rose-water; let it stand close
covered twelve hours, then wring out that, and put it in a pint of fresh
Rose-water into a high Gallipot with the _Faeces_; then tie it close up,
and set it in a pot of water, and let it boil two hours then take it
out, and strain it into an earthen Pan, let it stand till it be cold;
then cut a hole in it, and let out the water, then scrape away the
bottom, and dry it with a cloth, and dry the pan, melt it in a
Chafing-dish of Coales, or in the Gallipots; beat it so long till it
look very white and shining; then with your hand fling it in fine Cakes
upon white paper, and let it lye till it be cold, then put it into
Gallipots. This will be very good for two or three years.



_To make Raisin Wine._

Take two pound of Raisins of the Sun shred, a pound of good powdered
Sugar, the juice of two Lemons, one pill, put these into an earthen Pot
with a top, then take two gallons of water, let it boil half an hour,
then take it hot from the fire, and put it into the pot, and cover it
close for three or four dayes, stirring it twice a day, being strained
put it into bottles, and stop it more close, in a fortnight or three
weeks it may be drunk; you may put in Clove Gilly flowers, or Cowslips,
as the time of the year is when you make it; and when you have drawn
this from the Raisins, and bottled it up, heat two quarts of water more,
put it to the ingredients, and let it stand as aforesaid. This will be
good, but smaller than the other, the water must be boiled as the other.



_To make Rasberry Wine._

Take a Gallon of good Rhenish Wine, put into it as much Rasberries very
ripe as will make it strong, put it in an earthen pot, and let it stand
two dayes, then pour your Wine from your Rasberries, and put into every
bottle two ounces of Sugar, stop it up and keep it by you.



_The best way to preserve Cherries._

Take the best Cherries you can get, and cut the stalks something short,
then for every pound of these Cherries take two pound of other
Cherries, and put them of their stalks and stones, put to them ten
spoonfuls of fair water, and then set them on the fire to boil very fast
till you see that the colour of the syrup be like pale Claret wine, then
take it off the fire, and drain them from the Cherries into a Pan to
preserve in. Take to every pound of Cherries a quarter of Sugar, of
which take half, and dissolve it with the Cherry water drained from the
Cherries, and keep them boiling very fast till they will gelly in a
spoon, and as you see the syrup thin, take off the Sugar that you kept
finely beaten, and put it to the Cherries in the boiling, the faster
they boil, the better they will be preserved, and let them stand in a
Pan till they be almost cold.



_A Tincture of Ambergreece._

Take Ambergreece one ounce, Musk two drams, spirit of Wine half a pint,
or as much as will cover the ingredients two or three fingers breadth,
put all into a glass, stop it close with a Cork and Bladder; set it in
Horse dung ten or twelve days, then pour off gently the Spirit of Wine,
and keep it in a Glass close stopt, then put more spirit of Wine on the
Ambergreece, and do as before, then pour it off, after all this the
Ambergreece will serve for ordinary uses. A drop of this will perfume
any thing, and in Cordials it is very good.



_To make Usquebath the best way._

Take two quarts of the best _Aqua vitae_, four ounces of scraped
liquorish, and half a pound of sliced Raisins of the Sun, Anniseeds four
ounces, Dates and Figs, of each half a pound, sliced Nutmeg, Cinnamon,
Ginger, of each half an ounce, put these to the _Aqua vitae_, stop it
very close, and set it in a cold place ten dayes, stirring it twice a
day with a stick, then strain and sweeten it with Sugar-candy; after it
is strained, let it stand till it be clear, then put into the glass Musk
and Ambergreece; two grains is sufficient for this quantity.



_To preserve Cherries with a quarter of their weights in Sugar._

Take four pound of Cherries, one pound of Sugar, beat your Sugar and
strew a little in the bottom of your skillet, then pull off the stalk
and stones of your Cherries, and cut them cross the bottom with a knife;
let the juyce of the Cherries run upon the Sugar; for there must be no
other liquor but the juyce of the Cherries; cover your Cherries over
with one half of your Sugar, boil them very quick, when they are half
boiled, put in the remainder of your sugar, when they are almost enough,
put in the rest of the sugar; you must let them boil till they part in
sunder like Marmalade, stirring them continually; so put them up hot
into your Marmalade glasses.



_To make Gelly of Pippins._

Take Pippins, and pare them, and quarter them, and put as much water to
them as will cover them, and let them boil till all the vertue of the
Pippins are out; then strain them, and take to a pint of that liquor a
pound of Sugar, and cut long threads of Orange peels, and boil in it,
then take a Lemon, and pare and slice it very thin, and boil it in your
liquor a little thin, take them out, and lay them in the bottom of your
glass, and when it is boiled to a gelly, pour it on the Lemons in the
glass. You must boil the Oranges in two or three waters before you boil
it in the gelly.



_To make Apricock Cakes._

Take the fairest Apricocks you can get, and parboil them very tender,
then take off the Pulp and their weight of Sugar, and boil the Sugar and
Apricocks together very fast, stir them ever lest they burn to, and when
you can see the bottom of the Skillet it is enough; then put then into
Cards sowed round, and dust them with fine Sugar, and when they are cold
stone them, then turn them, and fill them up with some more of the same
stuff; but you must let them stand for three or four dayes before you
turn them off the first place; and when you find they begin to candy,
take them out of the Cards, dust them with Sugar again; so do ever when
you turn them.



_To preserve Barberries the best way._

First stone them and weigh them, half a pound of sugar to half a pound
of them, then pair them and slice them into that liquor, take the weight
of it in sugar; then take as many Rasberries as will colour it, and
strain them into the liquor, then put in the sugar, boil it as fast as
you can, then skim it till it be very clear, then put in your
Barberries, and that sugar you weighed, and so let them boil till the
skin be fully risen up, then take them off, and skin them very clean,
and put them up.



_To make Lozenges of Red Roses._

Boil your sugar to sugar again, then put in your Red Roses being finely
beaten and made moist with the juyce of a Lemmon, let it not boil after
the Roses are in but pour it upon a Pye-plate, and cut it into what form
you please.



_To make Chips of Quinces._

First scald them very well, then slice them into a Dish, and pour a
Candy Syrup to them scalding hot, and let them stand all night, then lay
them on plates, and searse sugar on them, and turn them every day, and
scrape more sugar on them till they be dry. If you would have them look
clear, heat them in syrup, but not to boil.



_To make Sugar of Wormwood, Mint, Anniseed, or any other of that kinde._

Take double refined Sugar, and do but wet it in fair water, or
Rose-water and boil it to a Candy, when it is almost boiled take it off,
and stir it till it be cold; then drop in three or four drops of the
Oyls of whatsoever you will make, and stir it well; then drop it on a
board, being before fitted with Sugar.



_To make Syrup of Lemons or Citrons._

Pare off all the rindes, then slice your Lemmons very thin, and lay a
lare of Sugar finely beaten, and a lare of Lemons in a silver Bason
till you have filled it, or as much as you mean to make, & so let it
stand all night; the next day pour off the liquor that runs from it into
a glass through a Tiffany strainer. Be sure you put sugar enough to them
at the first, and it will keep a year good, if it be set up well.



_To make Jambals of Apricocks or Quinces._

Take Apricocks or Quinces, and quoddle them tender, then take their Pulp
and dry it in a dish over a Chafing-dish of coals, and set it in a Stove

of twelve hours, and when you gather them, wipe them with a clean linnen
cloth, and cut off a little of the stalks of every one, then set two
skillets of water on the fire, and when one is scalding hot put in your

which if they be boiled enough, will gelly when it is cold; then take up
your Plums, and put them into a Gallipot, but boil your Syrup a little
longer, then strain it into some vessel, and being blood-warm, pour it

turn of themselves; and when they have been five or six days in the

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
