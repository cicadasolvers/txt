SUGGESTIONS FOR PRESERVING A RECORD OF EXISTING MONUMENTS.

When, in the opening Number of the present Volume (p. 14), we called the
attention of our readers to the _Monumentarium of Exeter Cathedral_, we
expressed a hope that the good services which Mr. Hewett had thereby
rendered to all genealogical, antiquarian, and historical inquirers would
be so obvious as to lead a number of labourers into the same useful field.
That hope bids fair to be fully realised. In Vol. iii., p. 116., we printed
a letter from MR. PEACOCK, announcing his intention of copying the
inscriptions in the churches and churchyards of the Hundred of Manley; and
we this week present our readers with three fresh communications upon the
subject.

We give precedence to MISS BOCKETT'S, inasmuch as it involves no general
proposal upon the subject, but is merely expressive of that lady's
willingness, in which we have no doubt she will be followed by many of her
countrywomen to help forward the good work.

    In your Number for Feb. 15th, I find MR. EDWARD PEACOCK, Jun., of
    Bottesford Moors, Messingham, Kirton Lindsey, wishes to collect church
    memorials for work he intends to publish. If he would like the accounts
    of monuments in the immediate neighbourhood of Reading, as far as I am
    able it would give me pleasure to send some to him.

    JULIA R. BOCKETT.

    Southcote Lodge, near Reading.

The second makes us acquainted with a plan for the publication of a
_Monumenta Anglicana_ by MR. DUNKIN,--a plan which would have our hearty
concurrence and recommendation, if it were at all practicable; but which,
it will be seen at a glance, must fail from its very vastness. If the
_Monumentarium of Exeter_ contains the material for half a moderate-sized
octavo volume, in what number of volumes does MR. DUNKIN propose to
complete his collection--even if a want of purchasers of the early volumes
did not nip in the bud his praiseworthy and well-intentioned scheme?

    Your correspondent MR. EDW. PEACOCK, Jun, may be interested in knowing
    that a work has some time been projected by my friend Mr. Alfred John
    Dunkin of Dartford (whose industry and antiquarian learning render him
    well fitted for the task), under the title of _Monumenta Anglicana_,
    and which is intended to be a medium for preserving the inscriptions in
    every church in the kingdom. There can be no doubt of the high value
    and utility of such a work, especially if accompanied by a
    well-arranged index of names; and I have no doubt MR. PEACOCK, and
    indeed many others of your valued correspondents, will be induced to
    {218} assist in the good cause, by sending memoranda of inscriptions to
    Mr. Dunkin.

    L. J.

    Plymouth.

The following letter from the REV. E. S. TAYLOR proposes a Society for the
purpose:--

    I for one shall be happy to co-operate with MR. PEACOCK in this useful
    work; and I trust that, through the valuable medium of "NOTES AND
    QUERIES," many will be induced to offer their assistance. Could not a
    Society be formed for the purpose, so that mutual correspondence might
    take place?

    E. S. TAYLOR.

    Martham, Norfolk.

We doubt the necessity, and indeed the advisability, of the formation of
any such Society.

MR. PEACOCK (_ante_., p. 117.) has already wisely suggested, that "in time
a copy of every inscription in every church in England might be ready for
reference in our National Library," and we have as little doubt that the
MS. department of the British Museum is the proper place of deposit for
such records, as that the trustees would willingly accept the charge of
them on the recommendation of their present able and active Keeper of the
Manuscripts. What he, and what the trustees would require, would be some
security that the documents were what they professed to be; and this might
very properly be accomplished through the agency of such a Society as MR.
TAYLOR proposes, if there did not already exist a Society upon whom such a
duty might very safely be devolved:--and have we not, in the greater energy
which that Society has lately displayed, evidence that it would undertake a
duty for which it seems pre-eminently fitted? We allude to the Society of
Antiquaries. The anxiety of Lord Mahon, its president, to promote the
efficiency of that Society, has recently been made evident in many ways;
and we cannot doubt that he would sanction the formation of a sub-committee
for the purpose of assisting in collecting and preserving a record of all
existing monuments, or that he would find a lack of able men to serve on
such a committee, when he numbers among the official or active Fellows of
the Society gentlemen so peculiarly fitted to carry out this important
national object, as Mr. Hunter, Sir Charles Young, Mr. J. Payne Collier,
and Mr. Bruce.

Notes.

ON THE WORD "RACK" IN SHAKSPEARE'S TEMPEST.

As another illustration of the careless or superficial manner in which the
meaning of Shakspeare has been sought, allow me to call attention to the
celebrated passage in the _Tempest_ in which the word "rack" occurs. The
passage really presents no difficulty; and the meaning of the word, as it
appears to me, might as well be settled at once and for ever. I make this
assertion, not dogmatically, but with the view of testing the correctness
of my opinion, that this is not at all a question of etymology, but
entirely one of construction. The passage reads as follows:--

                 "These, our actors,
  As I foretold you, were all spirits, and
  Are melted into air, into thin air:
  And, like the baseless fabrick of this vision,
  The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces,
  The solemn temples, the great globe itself,
  Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve;
  And, like this insubstantial pageant, faded,
  Leave not a rack behind."--_Tempest_, Act IV. Sc. 1.

As I have expressed my opinion that this is not at all a question of
etymology, I shall not say more in reference to this view of the case than
that "rack," spelt as in Shakspeare, is a word in popular and every-day use
in the phrase "rack and ruin;" that we have it in the term "rack off," as
applied to wine, meaning _to take from the rack_, or, in other words, "to
leave a rack" or _refuse_ "behind," racked wine being wine drawn from the
lees; and that it is, I believe, still in use in parts of England, meaning
_remains_ or _refuse_, as, in the low German, "der Wraek" means the same
thing. Misled, however, by an unusual mode of spelling, and unacquainted
with the literature of Shakspeare's age, certain of the commentators
suggested the readings of _track_ and _trace_; whereupon Horne Tooke
remarks:--

    "The ignorance and presumption of his commentators have shamefully
    disfigured Shakspeare's text. The first folio, notwithstanding some few
    palpable misprints, requires none of their alterations. Had they
    understood English as well as he did, they would not have quarrelled
    with his language."--_Diversions of Purley_, p. 595.

He proceeds to show that _rack_ "is merely the past tense, and therefore
past participle, [reac] or [rec], of the Anglo-Saxon verb Recan,
_exhalare_, to _reek_;" and although the advocates of its being a
particular description of light cloud refer to him as an authority for
their reading, he treats it throughout generally as "a vapour, a steam, or
an exhalation." But Horne Tooke, in his zeal as an etymologist, forgot
altogether to attend to the construction of the passage. What is it that
shall "leave not a rack behind?" A rack of what? Not of the baseless fabric
of this vision, like which the "cloud-capp'd towers shall dissolve,"--not
of this insubstantial pageant, like which they shall have faded,--but of
"the cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces, the solemn temples, the
great globe itself." There is in fact a double comparison; but the
construction and the meaning are perfectly clear, and no word will suit the
passage but one that shall express a result common {219} to the different
objects enumerated. A cloud may be a fit object for comparison, but it is
utterly inconsequential; while the sense required can only be expressed by
a general term, such as _remains_, a _vestige_, or a _trace_.

I beg now to transcribe a note Of Mr. Collier's on this passage:--

    "'Rack' is vapour, from _reck_, as Horne Tooke showed; and the light
    clouds on the face of heaven are the 'rack,' or vapour from the earth.
    The word 'rack' was often used in this way."--Coll. _Shaksp._, vol. i.
    p. 70.

Mr. Knight appears to incline to the same view; and regarding these as the
two latest authorities, and finding in neither of them any reference to the
question of construction, I naturally concluded that the point had been
overlooked by the commentators. On reference, however, I found to my
surprise, that Malone, for the very same reasons, had come to the same
conclusion. Had Malone's argument been briefly stated by the "two latest
and best editors," I should, of course, have had no occasion to trouble you
with this note: and this instance, it appears to me, furnishes additional
reasons for enforcing the principle for which I am contending; the neglect
of it affecting, in however slight a degree, the sense or correctness of so
important and frequently quoted a passage. For my own part, I should have
thought that the commonest faith in Shakspeare would have protected any
editor, whose avowed object it was to restore the text, from preferring in
this instance, to the plain common sense of Malone, the more showy
authority of Horne Tooke.

In my last paper I wrote,--"So far as quantity is concerned, to eat a
crocodile would be _no_ more than to eat an ox." You have omitted the
negative.

ANCIENT INEDITED POEMS, NO. III.

In my last communication on this subject, I forgot to remark on the strange
title given to the monody on Mr. Browne. May I ask if the name of "Chorus"
was thus indiscriminately applied at the time when the poem was composed?

The next poem that I shall give is copied from _Harleian MSS._, 367., art.
60., fol. 158. It is entitled--

     "A VERTUOUS WOMAN.

 "When painted vice fils upp the rimes
  Of these our last depraued times:
  And soe much lust by wanton layes
  Dispersed is; that beautie strayes
  Into darke corners wheere vnseen,                              5
  Too many sadd berefts haue been.
  Aduance my muse to blaze[1] that face
  Wheere beautie sits enthroand in grace.
  The eye though bright, and quicke to moue,
  Daignes not a cast to wanton loue.                            10
  A comely ffront not husht in hayre,
  Nor face be-patcht to make it fayre.
  The lipps and cheekes though seemely redd,
  Doe blush afresh if by them fedd.
  Some wanton youthes doe gaze too much                         15
  Though naked breasts are hidd from touch.
  When due salutes are past, they shunn
  A seconde kisse: yea, half vndone
  Shee thinkes herselfe, when wantons praise
  Her hande or face with such loose phraise                     20
  As they haue learnt at acts and scenes,
  Noe hand in hand with them shee meenes,
  Shall giue them boldnes to embalme,
  Ther filthie fist in her chast palme.
  Her pretious honners overlookes,                              25
  At her retires the best of bookes.
  Whatsoeuer else shee doth forget
  Noe busines shall her prayers[2] let.
  Those that bee good, shee prizes most,
  Noe time with them shee counteth lost.                        30
  Her chast delights, her mind, aduance
  Above Lot-games or mixed dance.
  Shee cares not for an enterlude,
  Or idly will one day conclude.
  The looser toungs that filth disclose                         35
  Are graueolencie to her nose.
  But when a vertuous man shall court
  Her virgin thoughts in nuptiall sort:
  Her faire depor[t]ment, neyther coy
  Nor yet too forward, fits his ioy,                            40
  And giues his kisses leaue to seale
  On her fayre hand his faythfull zeale.
  Blest is his conquest in her loue,
  With her alone death cann remoue.
  And if before shee did adorne                                 45
  Her parents' howse, the cheerefull morne
  Reioyceth now at this blest payre,
  To see a wife soe chast soe fayre.
  They happy liue; and know noe smart
  Of base suspects or iealous heart;                            50
  And if the publike bredd noe feare,
  Nor sadd alarms did fill ther care,
  From goodnes flowes ther ioy soe cleere
  As grace beginnes ther heauen heere."

The poem has no subscription, nor, from the appearance of the paper, should
I say there had been one. The comparatively modern phraseology points to a
late era. The poem is bound up with a quantity of John Stowe's papers, and
I think is in his handwriting, upon comparing it with other papers known to
be his in the same book. As it is my chief object (next to contributing to
the preservation and publication of these ancient ballads) to obtain data
regarding the anonymous productions of the earlier days of England's
literature, any remarks, allow me to say, that other contributors will
favour our {220} medium of intercommunication with, will be much
appreciated by

KENNETH R. H. MACKENZIE.

    [Our correspondent is certainly mistaken in supposing this poem to be
    in Stowe's handwriting. We have the best possible authority for
    assuring him that it is not.]

FOLK LORE.

_Moths called Souls._--While I am upon this subject, I may as well mention
that in Yorkshire the country-people used in my youth, and perhaps do
still, call night-flying white moths, especially the _Hepialus humuli_,
which feeds, while in the grub state, on the roots of docks and other
coarse plants, "souls." Have we not in all this a remnant of "Psyche?"

F. S.

    [This latter paragraph furnishes a remarkable coincidence with the
    tradition from the neighbourhood of Truro (recorded by MR. THOMS in his
    Folk lore of Shakspeare, _Athenaeum_ (No. 1041.) Oct. 9. 1847) which
    gives the name of _Piskeys_ both to the _fairies_ and to _moths_, which
    are believed by many to be _departed souls_.]

_Holy Water for the Hooping Cough_ (vol. iii., p. 179.).--In one of the
principal towns of Yorkshire, half a century ago, it was the practice for
persons in a respectable class of life to take their children, when
afflicted with the hooping cough, to a neighbouring convent, where the
priest allowed them to drink a small quantity of holy water out of a silver
chalice, which the little sufferers were strictly forbidden to touch. By
Protestant, as well as Roman Catholic parents, this was regarded as a
remedy. Is not the superstition analogous to that noticed by MR. WAY?

EBORACOMB.

_Daffy Down Dilly._--At this season, when the early spring flowers are
showing themselves, we hear the village children repeating these lines:--

 "Daff a down dill has now come to town,
  In a yellow petticoat and a green gown."

Does not this nursery rhyme throw light upon the character of the royal
visitor alluded to in the snail charm recorded by F. J. H. (p. 179.)?

DR. MAITLAND'S ILLUSTRATIONS AND ENQUIRIES RELATING TO MESMERISM.

I know more than one person who would second the request that I am about to
make through "NOTES AND QUERIES" to DR. MAITLAND, that he would publish the
remaining parts of his _Illustrations and Enquiries relating to Mesmerism_:
he would do so, I know, at once, if he thought that anybody would benefit
by them; and I can bear witness to Part I. as having been already of some
use. It is high time that Christians should be decided as to whether or no
they may meddle with the fearful power whose existence is is impossible to
ridicule any longer. DR. MAITLAND has suggested the true course of thought
upon the subject, and promised to lead us along it; but it is impossible at
present to use anything that he has said, on account of its incompleteness.
In tracing the subject through history, DR. MAITLAND would no doubt mention
the "[Greek: Omphalopsuchoi], or Umbilicani," of the fourteenth century,
whose practices make a page (609.) of Waddington's _History of the Church_
read like a sketch of Middle-age Mesmerism, contemptuously given. Also, in
Washington Irving's _Life of Mahomet_, a belief somewhat similar to theirs
is stated to have been preached in the seventh century (_Bohn's Reprint in
Shilling Series_, p. 191.) by a certain Moseilma, a false prophet.

I may add that Miss Martineau's new book, _Letters of the Development of
Man's Nature, by Atkinson and Martineau_, which cannot be called sceptical,
for its unbelief is unhesitating, is the immediate cause of my writing
to-day.

Minor Notes.

_Original Warrant._--The following warrant from the original in the
Surrenden collection may interest some of your correspondents, as bearing
upon more than one Query that has appeared in your columns:--

    "Forasmuch as S^r John Payton, Knight, Lieutenant of the Tower, hath
    heretofore receaved a warrant from the Lls. of the counsell, by her
    Ma^{ts} commandment, for the removinge of Wright the Preist out of the
    Tower, to Framingham Castle, and for that, since then, it is thought
    more convenient, that he be removed to the Clincke--Theise therefore
    shalbe to require now (sic) to enlarge him of his imprisonment in the
    Tower, and to deliver him prisoner into the hands of the L. Bishop of
    London, to be committed by his Lp. to the Clincke, because it is for
    her M^{ts} speciall service,--for doinge whereof, this shalbe your
    warrant.

_Gloves.--Prince Rupert._--In your First Vol., pp. 72. 405., and in other
places in Vol. ii., there are notices with respect to the presentation of
_gloves_. If what is contained in the following {221} paper be not
generally known, it may claim an interest with some of your readers:--

    "At the Court of Whitehall, the 23rd of October, 1678. Present

      The Kings most excellent Majesty,
        His Highness _Prince Rupert_,
        Lord Archbp. of Canterbury,"
      [with twelve others, who are named.]

    "Whereas formerly it hath been a custom upon the Consecra[~c]on of all
    [~B]ps for them to make presents of Gloves to all Persons that came to
    the Consecra[~c]on Dinners, and others, w^{ch} amounted to a great
    Su[~m] of Money, and was an unnecessary burden to them, His Ma^{tie}
    this day, taking the same into his considera[~c]on, was thereupon
    pleas'd to order in Council, that for the future there shall be no such
    distribu[~c]on of Gloves; but that in lieu thereof each Lord B[~p]
    before his Consecra[~c]on shall hereafter pay the Su[~m] of 50l. to be
    employ'd towards the Rebuilding of the Cathedral Church of St. Paul.
    And it was further ordered, that his Grace the Lord Archb[~p] of

_Inscription on a Gun_ (Vol. iii., p. 181.).--Your notes on "the Potter's

 "Of all the sports as is,
    I fancies most a gun;
  And, after my decease,

his _Grammatica Linguae Anglicanae_, first published in 1653. The passage
occurs in the 2d section of chapter 14, "De Etymologia." Wallis is treating
of the words _crook_, _crouch_, _cross_, &c., and says:

    "Hinc item _croisado_ de militibus dicebatur ad bellum (quod vocant)
    sanctum conscriptis (pro recuperanda terra sancta) qui a tergo
    gestabant formam Crucis; et _Richardus_ olim Rex Angliae dicebatur

_Origin of St. Andrew's Cross in connexion with Scotland._--John Lesley,
bishop of Ross, reports, that in the night before the battle between
Athelstan, king of England, and Hungus, king of the Picts, a bright cross,
like that whereon St. Andrew suffered, appeared to Hungus, who, having
obtained the victory, ever after bore that figure. This happened in 819.

_Snail-eating_ (Vol. iii., p. 207.).--Your correspondent C. W. B. does not
seem to be aware that "a ragout of boror (snails)" is a regular dish with
English _gypsies_. Vide Borrow's _Zincali_, part i. c. v.

He has clearly not read Mr. Borrow's remarks on the subject:

    "Know then, O Gentile, whether thou be from the land of Gorgios
    (England), or the Busne (Spain), that the very gypsies, who consider a
    ragout of snails a delicious dish, will not touch an eel because it
    bears a resemblance to a snake; and that those who will feast on a
    roasted hedgehog could be induced by no money to taste a squirrel!"

Having tasted of roasted hotchiwitchu (hedgehog) myself among the "gentle
Rommanys," I can bear witness to its delicate fatness; and though a ragout
of snails was never offered for my acceptance, I do not think that those
who consider (as most "Gorgios" do) stewed eels a delicacy ought to be too
sever on "Limacotrophists!"

HERMES.

_Snail-eating._--Perhaps you will permit me to remark, in reference to the
communication of C. W. B., that snails are taken medicinally occasionally,
and are supposed to be extremely strengthening. I have known them eagerly
sought after for the meal of a consumptive patient. As a matter of taste,
too, they are by {222} some considered quite epicurean. A gentleman whom I
used to know, was in the constant habit as he passed through the fields, of
picking up the white slugs that lay in his way, and swallowing them with
more relish than he would have done had they been oysters.

That snails make a no inconsiderable item in the bill of fare of gypsies,
and other wanderers, I proved while at Oxford, some time ago; for passing
up Shotover Hill, in the parish of Headington, I unexpectedly came upon a
camp of gypsies who were seated round a wood fire enjoying their Sunday's
dinner: this consisted of a considerable number of large snails roasted on
the embers, and potatoes similarly cooked. On inquiry, I was told by those
who were enjoying their repast, that they were extremely good, and were
much liked by people of their class, who made a constant practice of eating
them. I need hardly say that I received a most hospitable invitation to
join in the feast, which I certainly declined.

Queries.

HENRY SMITH.

In Marsden's _History of the Early Puritans_ (a work recently published,
which will well repay perusal) there occurs (pp. 178, 179.) the following
notice of Henry Smith:--

    "Henry Smith was a person of good family, and well connected; but
    having some scruples, he declined preferment, and aspired to nothing
    higher than the weekly Lectureship of St. Clement Danes. On a complaint
    made by Bishop Aylmer, Whitgift suspended him, and silenced for a while
    probably the most eloquent preacher in Europe. His contemporaries named
    him the Chrysostom of England. His church was crowded to excess; and
    amongst his hearers, persons of the highest rank, and those of the most
    cultivated and fastidious judgment, were content to stand in the throng
    of citizens. His sermons and treatises were soon to be found in the
    hands of every person of taste and piety: they passed through
    numberless editions. Some of them were carried abroad, and translated
    into Latin. They were still admired and read at the close of nearly a
    century, when Fuller collected and republished them. Probably the prose
    writing of this, the richest period of genuine English literature,
    contains nothing finer than some of his sermons. They are free, to an
    astonishing degree, from the besetting vices of his age--vulgarity, and
    quaintness, and affected learning; and he was one of the first English
    preachers who, without submitting to the trammels of a pedantic logic,
    conveyed in language nervous, pure, and beautiful, the most convincing
    arguments in the most lucid order, and made them the ground-work of
    fervent and impassioned addresses to the conscience."

Would it not be desirable, as well in a literary as a theological point of
view, that any extant sermons of so renowned a divine should be made
accessible to general readers? At present they are too rare and expensive
to be largely useful. A brief _Narrative of the Life and Death of Mr. Henry
Smith_ (as it is for substance related by Mr. Thomas Fuller in his _Church
History_), which is prefixed to an old edition (1643) of his sermons in my
possession, concludes in these words:--

    "The wonder of this excellent man's worth is increased by the
    consideration of his tender age, he dying very young (of a consumption
    as it is conceived) above fifty years since, about Anno 1600."

Minor Queries.

_Owen Glendower._--Some of your Cambrian correspondents might, through your
columns, supply a curious and interesting desideratum in historical
genealogy, by contributing a pedigree, authenticated as far as practicable
by dates and authorities, and including collaterals, of OWEN GLENDOWER,
from his ancestor Griffith Maelor, Lord of Bromfield, son of Madoc, last
Prince of Powys, to the extinction of Owen's male line.

All Cambrian authorities are, I believe, agreed in attributing to Owen the
lineal male representation of the sovereigns of Powys; but I am not aware
that there is any printed pedigree establishing in detail, on authentic
date, his descent, and that of the collaterals of his line; while
uncertainty would seem to exist as to one of the links in the chain of
deduction, as to the fate of his sons and their descendants, if any, as
well as to the marriages and representatives of more than one of his
daughters.

I have in vain looked for the particulars I have indicated in Yorke's
_Royal Tribes of Wales_; in the _Welsh Heraldic Visitation Pedigrees_,
lately published by the Welsh MSS. Society, under the learned editorship of
the late Sir Samuel Meyrick; and in the valuable contributions to the
genealogy of the Principality to be found in the _Landed Gentry_ and the
_Peerage and Baronetage_ of Mr. Burke,--a pedigree, in other respects
admirable, in the _Landed Gentry_ of a branch of the dynasty of Powys,
omitting the intermediate descents in question.

_Meaning of Gig-Hill._--Can any of your readers favour me with an
explanation of the following matter in local topography? There are two
places in the neighbourhood of Kingston-on-Thames distinguished by the name
of _Gig-Hill_[3], although there is no indication of anything in the land
to warrant the name.

{223}

Are there any instances to be met with where the place of punishment by the
stocks or pillory in olden times, was known by that name?

There was a king of Brittany who resigned his crown, and obtained the
honours of canonisation as Saint Giguel, in the seventh century. St. Giles,
who died about the sixth century, might, perhaps, have had some connexion
with those who are traditionally believed to have been punished on the
spot; that is, if we judge by his clients, who locate themselves under the
sanctity of his name as a "Guild" or fraternity in London.

There is, however, a curious use by Shakspeare of the word gig. It occurs
in _Love's Labour's Lost_, Act V. Sc. I.:

Holofernes says,

    "What is the figure?"

    _Moth._ Horns.

    _Holofernes._ Thou disputest like an infant. Go, whip thy gig."

I submit this matter, as local names have often their origin in religious
associations or in proverbial philosophy.

It has been suggested that _giggle_, as a mark of the derision to which the
culprit was exposed, might so become corrupted.

If the term be connected with the punishment, it would be, doubtless, one
of general application. The smallest contribution will be thankfully
received.

[Footnote 3: [One of these places, namely, that on the road from Kingston
to Ditton, is, we believe, known as Gig's Hill.--ED.]]

_Sir John Vaughan._--In the patent under which the barony of Hamilton of
Hackallen, in the county of Meath, was granted on the 20th of October, in
the second year of the reign of George I., to Gustavus Hamilton, he is
described as son of Sir Frederick Hamilton, Knt., by Sidney, daughter and
heiress of Sir John Vaughan, Knt.; and that the said Dame Sidney Hamilton
was descended from an honourable line of ancestors, one of whom, Sir Will
Sidney, was Chamberlain to Henry II., another of the same name Comptroller
of the Household to Henry VIII., &c., &c.

Can any of your genealogical friends inform me who the above-named Sir John
Vaughan married, and in what way she was connected with the Sidneys of
Penshurst, as the pedigree given by Collins contains no mention of any such
marriage?

The arms of Sir John Vaughan, which appear quartered with those of Hamilton
and Arran in the margin of the grant, are,--Argent, a chevron sable between
three infants' heads coupled at the shoulders, each entwined round the neck
with a snake, all proper, thereby intimating his descent from the Vaughans
of Porthaml Tretower, &c., in the county of Brecon.

_A Monumental Inscription._--Near the chancel door of the parish-church of
Wath-upon-Dearne, in Yorkshire, is an upright slab inscribed to the memory
of William Burroughs. After stating that he was of Masbro', gentleman, and
that he died in the year 1722, the monument contains the two following
hexameters:--

 "Burgus in hoc tumulo nunc, Orthodoxus Itermus,
  Deposuit cineres, animam revocabit Olympus."

The meaning of all which is obvious, except of the words "Orthodoxus
Itermus:" and I should be glad to have this unscanning doggrel translated.
It has been conjectured that _Itermus_ must be derived from _iter_, and
hence that Burroughs may have been a _traveller_, or possibly _an orthodox
itinerant preacher_: surely there can be no punning reference to _a
journeyman_! The lines have been submitted, in vain, to some high literati
in Oxford.

"Grayle?" Tennyson has a short poem on the knightly search after it, called
"Sir Galahad." And in Spenser's _Faerie Queene_, book ii. cant. x. 53.,
allusion is made to the legend that "Joseph of Arimathy brought it to

word to be found explained? Is it Roman or Spanish? There is none such in
our language, at least used by gentlemen."

    "It hath been observed by the Ancients, that when a Raine Bow seemeth
    to hang over or to touch, there breaketh forth a sweet smell. The cause
    is, for that this happenth but in certain matters which have in
    themselves some sweetnesse, which the Gentle Dew of the Raine Bow doth
    draw forth. And the like doe soft showers; for they also make the
    ground sweet. But none are so delicate as the Dew of the Raine Bow,
    where it falleth. It may be also that the water itself hath some
    sweetnesse: for the Raine Bow consisteth of a glomeration of small
    drops which cannot possibly fall but from the Aire that is very low.
    And therefore may hold giving sweetnesse of the herbs and flowers, as a

Minor Queries Answered.

_Supporters borne by Commoners._--Can any of your readers state why some
commoners bear supporters, and whether the representatives of Bannerets are
entitled to do so? I find in Burke's _Dictionary of Landed Gentry_, that
several gentlemen in England, Scotland, and Ireland continue to use them.
See Fulford, p. 452.; Wyse, p. 1661.; Hay-Newton, p. 552., &c. &c.

The late Mr. Portman, father of Lord Portman, used supporters, as do Sir W.
Carew, Bart., and some other baronets.

    [Baronets are not entitled, _as such_, to bear supporters, which are

    There are many baronets who by virtue of especial warrants from the
    sovereign have, as acts of grace and favour, in consideration of
    services rendered to the state, received such grants; and in these
    instances they are limited to descend with the dignity only. No doubt
    there are some private families who assume and improperly bear

  The lees and _dregs_ of a flat-tamed piece."

The meaning is plainly here _avaler_, not _boire_.

Here is another, which does not perhaps illustrate the passage in _Hamlet_,
but resembles it (Act III. Sc. 2.):

    "When we vow to weep seas, live in fire, eat rocks, tame tigers,

    [We are warned by several correspondents that this subject is becoming
    as bitter as wormwood to them. Before we dismiss it, however, we must
    record in our pages the opinion of one of the most distinguished
    commentators of the day, Mr. Hunter, who in his _New Illustrations_,
    vol. ii. p. 263., after quoting "potions of eysell" from the sonnet,
    says, "This shows it was not any river so called, but some desperate
    drink. The word occurs often in a sense in which _acetum_ is the best
    representative, associated with verjuice and vinegar. It is the term
    used for one ingredient of the bitter potion given to our Saviour on
    the cross, about the composition of which the commentators are greatly
    divided. Thus the eighth prayer of the Fifteen Oos in the _Salisbury
    Primer_, 1555, begins thus: 'O Blessed Jesu, sweetness of heart and
    ghostly pleasure of souls, I beseech thee for the bitterness of the
    _aysell_ and gall that thou tasted and suffered for me in thy passion,'
    &c."

    _up_;" quoting from Haldorson's _Icelandic Lexicon_, Eysill, m.

    pump or a bucket? We have also received a Note from G. F. G. showing
    that _eisel_ in Dutch, German, and Anglo-Saxon, &c., meant _vinegar_,
    and stating, that during his residence in Florence in 1817, 1818, and
    1819, he had often met with wormwood wine at the table of the Italians,
    a weak white wine of Tuscany, in which wormwood had been infused, which
    was handed round by the servants immediately after the soup, and was
    believed to promote digestion.]

SCANDAL AGAINST QUEEN ELIZABETH.

(Vol. ii., p. 393.; Vol. iii., pp. 11. 151. 197.)

The Marquis of Ormonde having been informed that certain statements, little
complimentary to the reputation of Queen Elizabeth, and equally
discreditable to the name of his ancestor, Thomas, Earl of Ormonde, have
appeared in "NOTES AND QUERIES," wherein it is stated "that the Ormonde
family possess documents which afford proof of this," begs to assure the
editor of the journal in question, that the Ormonde collection of papers,
&c. contains nothing that bears the slightest reference to the very
calumnious attack on the character of good Queen Bess.

Hampton Court, March 17. 1851.

    [If the Marquis of Ormonde will do us the favour to refer to our Number
    for the 8th March (No. 71.), he will find he has not been correctly
    informed with respect to the article to which his note relates. The
    family in which the papers are stated to exist, is clearly not that of
    the noble Marquis, but the family with which our correspondent "J. BS."
    states himself to be "connected;" and we hope J. BS. will, in justice
    both to himself and to Queen Elizabeth, adopt the course suggested in
    the following communication. We believe the warmest admirers of that
    great Queen cannot better vindicate her character than by making a

    circulated against her.]

{226}

J. BS. says papers are "said to exist in the family which prove the
statement." As it is one of _scandal_ against a female, and that female a
great sovereign, should he not ascertain the fact of the existence of any
such paper, before supporting the scandal, and not leave a _tradition_ to
be supported by another tradition, when a little trouble might show whether
any papers exist, and when found what their value may be.

THE MISTLETOE ON THE OAK.

(Vol. ii., pp. 163. 214.; Vol. iii., p. 192.)

From having been a diligent searcher for the mistletoe on the oak, I may be
allowed to make a few remarks upon the question. Is it ever found now on
other trees? Now, it not only occurs abundantly on other trees, but it is
exceedingly rare on the oak. This may be gathered from the following list,
in which numbers have been used to express comparative frequency, as near
as my observations enable me to form a judgment:--

  _On Native Trees._

  Apple (various sorts)                                         25
  Poplar (mostly the black)                                     20
  Whitethorn                                                    10
  Lime                                                           4
  Maple                                                          3
  Willow                                                         2
  OAK                                                            1

  _On Foreign Trees._

  Sycamore                                                       1
  Robinia                                                        1

From this it would appear that notwithstanding the BRITISH OAK grows
everywhere, it is at present only favoured by the companionship of the
mistletoe in equal ratio with two comparatively recently introduced trees.
Indeed such objection does this parasite manifest to the brave old tree,
even in his teens, that, notwithstanding a newly-planted line of mixed
trees will become speedily attacked by it, the oak is certain to be left in
his pride alone.

I have, however, seen the mistletoe on the oak in two instances during my
much wandering about amid country scenes, especially of Gloucester and
Worcester, two great mistletoe counties. One was pointed out to me by my
friend, Mr. Lees, from whom we may expect much valuable information on this
subject, in his forthcoming edition of the _Botanical Looker-out_--it was
on a young tree, perhaps of fifty years, in Eastnor Park, on the Malvern
chain. The other example is at Frampton-on-Severn, to which the President
of the Cotteswold Naturalists' Club, T. B. L. Baker, Esq., and myself, were
taken by Mr. Clifford, of Frampton. The tree is full a century old, and the
branch, on which was a goodly bunch of the parasite, numbered somewhere
about forty years. That the plant is propagated by seeds there can, I
think, be but little doubt, as the seeds are so admirably adapted for the
peculiar circumstances under which alone they can propagate; and the want
of attention to the facts connected therewith, is probably the cause why
the propagation of the mistletoe by artificial means is usually a failure.

I should be inclined to think that the mistletoe never was abundant on the
oak; so that it may be that additional sanctity was conferred on the
_Viscum guerneum_ on account of its great rarity.

_Mistletoe upon Oak_ (Vol. ii., p. 214.).--Besides the mistletoe-bearing
oak mentioned by your correspondent, there is one in Lord Somers' park,
near Malvern. It is a very fine plant, though it has been injured by
sight-seeing marauders.

_Mistletoe_ (Vol. ii., pp. 163., 214.).--Do I understand your correspondent
to ask whether mistletoe is found now except on oaks? The answer is, as at
St. Paul's, "Circumspice." Just go into the country a little. The
difficulty is generally supposed to be to find it _on_ the oak.

UNIVERSALITY OF THE MAXIM, "LAVORA COME SE TU," ETC.

(Vol. iii., p. 188.)

I have not been able to trace this sentence to its source, but it would
most probably be found in that admirable book, _Monosinii Floris Italicae
Linguae_, 4to, Venet., 1604; or in Torriano's _Dictionary of Italian
Proverbs and Phrases_, folio, Lond., 1666, a book of which Duplessis doubts
the existence! Most of Jeremy Taylor's citations from the Italian are
proverbial phrases. Your correspondent has probably copied the phrase as it
stands in Bohn's edition of the _Holy Living and Dying_, but there is a
trifling variation as it stands in the first edition of _Holy Living_,
1650:--

 "Lavora come se tu _havesti_ a campar ogni hora:
  Adora come se tu _havesti_ a morir _alhora_."

The universality of this maxim, in ages and countries remote from each
other, is remarkable. Thus we find it in the HITOPADESA:

    "A wise man should think upon knowledge and wealth as if he were
    undecaying and immortal. He should practise duty as if he were seized
    by the hair of his head by Death."--Johnson's _Translation_, Intr. S.

So Democratis of Abdera, more sententiously:

    "[Greek: Houtos peiro zen, hos kai oligon kai polun chronon
    biosomenos]."

Then descending to the fifteenth century, we {227} have it thus in the racy
old Saxon _Laine Doctrinal_:

 "Men schal leven, unde darumme sorgen,
  Alse men Staerven sholde morgen,
  Unde leren ernst liken,
  Alse men leven sholde ewigliken."

Where the author of the _Voyage autour de ma Chambre_, Jean Xavier Maitre,
stumbled upon it, or whether it was a spontaneous thought, does not appear;
but in his pleasing little book, _Lettres sur la Vieillesse_, we have it
thus verbatim:

    "Il faut vivre comme si l'on avoit a mourir demain, mais s'arranger en
    meme temps sa vie, autant que cet arrangement peut dependre de notre
    prevoyance, comme si l'on avoit devant soi quelques siecles, et meme
    une eternite d'existence."

Some of your correspondents may possibly be able to indicate other
repetitions of this truly "golden sentence," which cannot be too often
repeated, for we all know that

 "A verse may reach him who a sermon flies."

_Tennyson's In Memoriam_ (Vol. iii., p. 142.).--

 "Before the crimson-circled star
  Had fallen into her father's grave."

means "before the planet Venus had sunk into the sea."

In Smith's _Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology_, under
the word Aphrodite or Venus, we find that--

    "Some traditions stated that she had sprung from the foam ([Greek:
    aphros]) of the sea which had gathered around the mutilated parts of
    Uranus, that had been thrown into the sea by Kronos, after he had
    unmanned his father."--Hesiod. _Theog._ 190.

The allusion in the first stanza of _In Memoriam_ is, I think, to Shelley.
The doctrine referred to is common to him and many other poets; but he
perhaps inculcates it more frequently than any other. (See _Queen Mab_ sub
finem. _Revolt of Islam_, canto xii. st. 17. _Adonais_, stanzas 39. 41. et
passim.) Besides this, the phrase "clear harp" seems peculiarly applicable
to Shelley, who is remarkable for the simplicity of his language.

X. Z.

_Tennyson's In Memoriam._--The word _star_ applies in poetry to all the
heavenly bodies; and therefore, to the _crescent moon_, which is often near
enough to the sun to be within or to be _encircled_ by, the crimson colour
of the sky about sunset; and the sun may, figuratively, be called _father_
of the moon, because he dispenses to her all the light with which she
shines; and, moreover, because _new_, or waxing moons, must _set_ nearly in
the same point of the horizon as the sun; and because that point of the
horizon in which a heavenly body sets, may, figuratively, be called its
_grave_; therefore, I believe the last two lines of the stanza of the poem
numbered lxxxvii., or 87, in Tennyson's _In Memoriam_, quoted by W. B. H.,
to mean simply--

_We returned home between the hour of sunset and the setting of the moon,
then not so much as a week old._

Machell, who was chaplain to King Charles II._, have been examined, and
published, by referring, to Burn and Nicholson's _History of Westmoreland

account of the antiquary's own family, the "Mali Catuli," or Machell's
Lords of Crakenthorpe in Westmoreland. the papers in the library of
Carlisle contain only copies and references to the original papers, which
are carefully preserved by the present representatives of the family. There
are above one thousand deeds, charters, and other documents which I have
carefully translated and collated with a view to their being printed
privately for the use of the family, and I shall feel pleasure in replying
to any inquiry on the subject. Address:

_Oration against Demosthenes_ (Vol. iii., p. 141.).--For the information of

"privately printed" as he supposes, but _published_ last year by Mr. J. W.
Parker.

    "The Oration of Hyperides against Demosthenes, respecting the Treasure
    of Harpalus. The Fragments of the Greek Text, now first edited from the
    Fac-simile of the MS. discovered at Egyptian Thebes in 1847; together
    with other Fragments of the same Oration cited in Ancient Writers. With

The discovery of the MS. was made by Mr. {228} A. C. Harris of Alexandria,
who placed a fac-simile in the hand of Mr. Churchill Babington, who edited
it as above described.

the German scholars Boeckh (in the _Hallische Litteratur-Zeitung_ for 1848)
and Sauppe have also written critical notices on the fragments; but whether
their notices include the old and new fragments, I am unable to say, having
only met with a scanty reference to their learned labours.

_Head of the Saviour_ (Vol. iii., p. 168.).--The correspondent who inquires
about the "true likeness" of the Saviour exposed in some of the London
print-shops, is not perhaps aware that there is preserved in the church of
St. Peter's at Rome a much more precious and genuine portrait than the one
to which he alludes--a likeness described by its possessors as "far more
sublime and venerable than any other, since it was neither painted by the
hands of men nor angels, but by the divinity himself who makes both men and
angels." It is not delineated upon wood or canvass, ivory, glass, or
stucco, but upon "a pocket handkerchief lent him by a holy woman named
Veronica, to wipe his face upon at the crucifixion" (Aringhi, _Roma
Subterran._, vol. ii. p. 543.). When the handkerchief was returned it had
this genuine portrait imprinted on its surface. It is now one of the
holiest of relics preserved in the Vatican basilica, where there is
likewise a magnificent altar constructed by Urban VIII., with an
inscription commemorating the fact, a mosaic above, illustrative of the
event, and a statue of the holy female who received the gift, and who is
very properly inscribed in the Roman catalogue of saints under the title of
ST. VERONICA. All this is supported by "pious tradition," and attested by
authorities of equal value to those which establish the identity of St.
Peter's chair. The only difficulty in the matter lies in this, that the
woman Veronica never had any corporeal existence, being no other than the
name by which the picture itself was once designated, viz., the VERA ICON,
or "True Image" (Mabillon, _Iter. Ital._, p. 88.). This narrative will
probably relieve your correspondent from the trouble of further inquiries
by enabling him to judge for himself whether "there is any truth" about the
other true image.

A. R., Jun.

In your 70th Number I perceived that some correspondent asked, "What is the
truth respecting a legend attached to the head of our Saviour for some time
past in the print-shops?" I ask the same question. True or false, I found
in a work entitled _The Antiquarian Repertory_, by Grose, Astle, and
others, vol. iii., an effigy of our Saviour, much inferior in all respects
to the above, with the following attached:--

    "This present figure is the similitude of our Lord [=IHV], oure Saviour
    imprinted in amirvld by the predecessors of the greate turke, and sent
    to the Pope Innosent the 8. at the cost of the greate turke for a token
    for this cawse, to redeme his brother that was taken presonor."

This was painted on board. The Rev. Thomas Thurlow, of Baynard's Park,
Guildford, has another painted on board with a like inscription, to the
best of my recollection: his has a date on it, I think.

Pope Innocent VIII. was created Pope in 1484, and died in 1492.

The variation in the three effigies is an argument against the truth of the
story, or the two on board must have been ill-executed. That in the shops
is very beautiful.

The same gentleman possesses a Bible, printed by Robert Barker, and by the
assignees of John Bill, 1633; and on a slip of paper is, "Holy Bible
curiously bound in tapestry by the nuns of Little Gidding, 12mo., Barker."

In a former Number a person replies that a Bible, bound by the nuns of
Gidding for Charles I., now belongs to the Marquis of Salisbury. Query the
_size of that_?

second son of Thomas Heigham, of Heigham, co. Suffolk) married, first, Sir
Richard Bingham, Knt., of Melcombe Bingham, co. Dorset, governor of

  And lack not to lose still:"

has not MR. SINGER, and all the other commentators upon this passage,
overlooked a most apparent and satisfactory solution? Is it not evident
that the printer simply omitted the vowel "a," and that the word, as
written by Shakespeare, was "cap_a_tious," the "t," according to the
orthography of the time, being put for the "c" used by modern writers?

With great deference to former critics, I think this emendation is the most
probable, as it accords with the sentiment of Helena, who means to depict
her _vast_ but unretentive sieve, into which she poured the waters of her
love.

is simply the Scotch for _amber_. He says _Lamertyn steen_ means the same
in Teutonic. I do not find it in Wachter's _Lexicon_.

Your correspondent's note is a curious instance of the inconvenience of
half quotation. He says the Lamas are an order of priests among the Western
Tartars. I was surprised at this, since their chief strength, as everybody
knows, is in Thibet. On referring to Rees's _Cyclopaedia_, I found that the
words are taken from thence; but they are not wrong there, since, by the
context they have reference to China.

marketplace of Carlisle, or as they call it "Carel," with a straw in their
mouths. It is fast passing away, and _now_, instead of keeping the straw
constantly in the mouth, they merely put it in a few seconds if they see
any one looking at them. Anderson, in his _Cumberland Ballads_, alludes to
the custom:--

therefore, how unsafe it is to trust to their observations. In this case,

memoir of George Steevens, the Shakspearian commentator, was ever
published, and what has become of the manuscripts.

I believe the late Sir James Allen Park wrote his life, but whether for
public or private circulation I cannot tell.

The late George Steevens had a relative, a Mrs. Collinson, and daughters
who lived with him at Hampstead, and with him when he died, in Jan. 1800.
Miss Collinson married a Mr. Pyecroft, whose death, I think, is in the
_Gentleman's Magazine_ for this month: perhaps the Pyecroft family may give
information respecting the manuscripts.

    "The house he lived in at Hampstead, called the Upper Flask, was
    formerly a place of public entertainment near the summit of Hampstead
    Hill. Here Richardson sends his Clarissa in one of her escapes from
    Lovelace. Here, too, the celebrated Kit-Cat Club used to meet in the
    summer months; and here, after it became a private abode, the no less
    celebrated George Steevens lived and died."--Vide Park's _Hampstead_,
    pp. 250. 352.

I just recollect Mr. Steevens, who was very kind to us, as children. My
mother, who is an octogenarian, remembers him well, and says he always took
a nosegay, tied to the top of his cane, every day to Sir Joseph Banks.

_Love's Labour's Lost_ (Vol. iii., p. 163.).--Your correspondent has very
neatly and ably made out how the names of the ladies ought to have been
placed; but the error is the poet's, not the printer's. It is impossible to
conceive how, in printing or transcribing, such a mistake should arise; the
names are quite unlike, and several lines distant from one another. Such
forgetfulness is not very uncommon in poets, especially those of the
quickest and liveliest spirit. It is the old mistake of Bentley and other
commentators, to think that whatever is wrong must be spurious. These, too,
we must recollect, are fictitious characters.

NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.

Agreeing with Mr. Lower, that they who desire to know the truth as to the
earlier periods of our national history, will do wisely to search for it
among the mists and shadows of antiquity, and rather collect it for
themselves out of the monkish chronicles than accept the statements of
popular historiographers, we receive with great satisfaction the addition
to our present list of translations of such chronicles, which Mr. Lower has
given us in _The Chronicle of Battel Abbey from 1066 to 1176, now first
translated, with Notes, and an Abstract of the subsequent History of the
Establishment_. The original Chronicle, which is preserved among the
Cottonian MSS., though known to antiquaries and historians, was never
committed to the press until the year 1846, when it was printed by the
_Anglia Christiana Society_ from a transcript made by the late Mr. Petrie.
Mr. Lower's translation has been made from that edition; and though
undertaken by him as an illustration of local history, will be found well
deserving the perusal of the general reader, not only from the light it
throws upon the Norman invasion and upon the {231} history of the abbey
founded by the Conqueror in fulfilment of his vow, but also for the
pictures it exhibits of the state of society during the period which it
embraces.

BOOKS RECEIVED.--_The Embarrassment of the Clergy in the Matter of Church
Discipline._ Two ably written letters by Presbyter Anglicanus, reprinted,
by request, from the _Morning Post_;--_Ann Ash, or the Foundling_, by the
_Author of 'Charlie Burton' and 'The Broken Arm.'_ If not quite equal to
_Charlie Burton_, and there are few children's stories which are so, it is
a tale well calculated to sustain the writer's well-deserved
reputation;--_Burns and his Biographers, being a Caveat to Cavillers, or an
Earnest Endeavour to clear the Cant and Calumnies which, for half a
Century, have clung, like Cobwebs, round the Tomb of Robert Burns._

Messrs. Sotheby and Wilkinson, of 93. Wellington Street, Strand, will sell
on Monday next, and five following days, the valuable Library of the late
Mr. Andrews of Bristol, containing, besides a large collection of works of
high character and repute, some valuable Historical, Antiquarian, and
Heraldic Manuscripts.

GILBERT'S COPIOUS SERIES OF PAMPHLETS on the ROMAN CATHOLIC QUESTION;
containing Important Documents of Permanent Historical Interest having
Reference to the Re-establishment of the CATHOLIC HIERARCHY IN ENGLAND,
1850-1.

The Editor of these Pamphlets deems it almost superfluous to dwell on the
paramount importance of every respectable family possessing this volume of
very special present and permanent interest. During the discussion of the
exciting matters now at issue in this all-absorbing question, there can be
no questioning the well-recognised fact that the possession of this copious
and cheap volume is essential to every thoughtful and inquiring person in
our beloved country. To enable those who are as yet unaware of the immense
mass of interesting and important documents there are in its pages, AN
INDEX OF ITS CONTENTS IS ISSUED FOR GRATUITOUS DISTRIBUTION--this will
abundantly testify to the fact; and the Editor, in conclusion, thinks it
only necessary to state that, with scarcely an exception, the whole of the
documents are printed, verbatim, as they originally appeared, and in very
numerous cases they have had the additional advantage of the direct and
special revision of the authors.

The Editor deems it necessary to state his conviction that all the
important facts and documents relative to the "Roman Catholic Question"
have appeared in the pages of these Pamphlets. Doubtless, during the
progress of the Ecclesiastical Titles Assumption Bill through the houses of
parliament many speeches of interest will be made; still the Editor thinks
they will, to a considerable extent, be merely elaborations of the
materials already in these pages, devoid of original facts or documents.
Should, however, on the conclusion of the debates, the Editor's opinions
undergo a change, he will issue the results in the form of an Appendix to
the present volume.

*** Any persons who may wish to possess the Series or sheet containing any
specific article particularised in the Index, will be at liberty to
purchase it separately, on One Penny or Three-half-pence each sheet
respectively, or at one penny each extra post-free, through the Publisher.
Series 1 to 17 sell at 1d., and 18 to 25 at 11/2d. each, but it must be
observed that each sheet or Series contains several documents.

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
