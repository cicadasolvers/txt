_INTRODUCTION_


The word "fat" is one of the most interesting in food chemistry. It
is the great energy producer. John C. Olsen, A.M., Ph.D., in his book,
"Pure Food," states that fats furnish half the total energy obtained
by human beings from their food. The three _primary_, solid cooking
fats today are:

[Illustration: _Butter Lard Crisco_]

There are numbers of substitutes for these, such as butterine,
oleomargarine and "lard compounds."

The following pages contain a story of unusual interest to _you_. For
you _eat_.

See Page 233




_The Story of Crisco_

The culinary world is revising its entire cook book on account of the
advent of Crisco, a new and altogether different cooking fat.

Many wonder that any product could gain the favor of cooking experts
so quickly. A few months after the first package was marketed,
practically every grocer of the better class in the United States was
supplying women with the new product.

This was largely because four classes of
people--housewives--chefs--doctors--dietitians--were glad to be shown
a product which at once would make for more _digestible_ foods, more
_economical_ foods, and better _tasting_ foods.


Cooking and History

[Illustration]

Cooking methods have undergone a marked change during the past few
years. The nation's food is becoming more and more wholesome as
a result of different discoveries, new sources of supply, and the
intelligent weighing of values. Domestic Science is better understood
and more appreciated.

[Illustration]

People of the present century are fairer to their stomachs,
realizing that their health largely depends upon this faithful and
long-suffering servant. Digestion and disposition sound much the same,
but a good disposition often is wrecked by a poor digestion.

America has been termed a country of dyspeptics. It is being changed
to a land of healthy eaters, consequently happier individuals. Every
agent responsible for this national digestive improvement must be
gratefully recognized.

[Illustration]

It seems strange to many that there can be anything _better_ than
butter for cooking, or of greater utility than lard, and the advent of
Crisco has been a shock to the older generation, born in an age less
progressive than our own, and prone to contend that the old fashioned
things are good enough.

[Illustration]

But these good folk, when convinced, are the greatest enthusiasts.
Grandmother was glad to give up the fatiguing spinning wheel. So the
modern woman is glad to stop cooking with expensive butter, animal
lard and their inadequate substitutes.

And so, the nation's cook book has been hauled out and is being
revised. Upon thousands of pages, the words "lard" and "butter" have
been crossed out and the word "Crisco" written in their place.


A Need Anticipated

Great foresight was shown in the making of Crisco.

The quality, as well as the quantity, of lard was diminishing
steadily in the face of a growing population. Prices were rising. "The
high-cost-of-living" was an oft-repeated phrase. Also, our country was
outgrowing its supply of butter. What was needed, therefore, was not
a _substitute_, but something _better_ than these fats, some product
which not only would accomplish as much in cookery, but _a great deal
more_.

When, therefore, Crisco was perfected, and it was shown that here
finally was an altogether _new_ and _better_ fat, cookery experts were
quick to show their appreciation.

In reading the following pages, think of Crisco as a _primary_ cooking
fat or shortening with even more individuality (because it does
greater things), than all others.


Man's Most Important Food, Fat

No other food supplies our bodies with the _drive_, the vigor, which
fat gives. No other food has been given so little study in proportion
to its importance.

Here are interesting facts, yet few housewives are acquainted with
them:

Fat contains more than twice the amount of energy-yielding power or
calorific value of proteids or carbohydrates. One half our physical
energy is from the fat we eat in different forms. The excellent book,
"Food and Cookery for the Sick and Convalescent," by Fannie Merritt
Farmer, states, "In the diet of children at least, a deficiency of fat
cannot be replaced by an excess of carbohydrates; and that fat seems
to play some part in the formation of young tissues which cannot be
undertaken by _any other constituent of food_...."

The book entitled "The Chemistry of Cooking and Cleaning," by the two
authorities, Ellen H. Richards and S. Maria Elliott, states that the
diet of school children should be regulated carefully with the fat
supply in view. Girls, especially, show at times a dislike for fat.
It therefore is necessary that the fat which supplies their growing
bodies with energy should be in the purest and most inviting form and
should be one that their digestions _welcome_, rather than repel.

[Illustration]

The first step in the digestion of fat is its melting. Crisco melts
at a lower degree of heat than body temperature. Because of its low
melting point, thus allowing the digestive juices to mix with it, and
because of its vegetable origin and its purity, Crisco is the easiest
of all cooking fats to digest.

When a fat smokes in frying, it "breaks down," that is, its chemical
composition is changed; part of its altered composition becomes a
non-digestible and irritating substance. The best fat for digestion
is one which does _not_ decompose or break down at frying temperature.
Crisco does not break down until a degree of heat is reached _above_
the frying point. In other words, Crisco does not break down at all
in normal frying, because it is not necessary to have it "smoking hot"
for frying. No part of it, therefore, has been transformed in cooking
into an irritant. That is one reason why the stomach welcomes Crisco
and carries forward its digestion with ease.


Working Towards an Ideal

A part of the preliminary work done in connection with the development
of Crisco, described in these pages, consisted of the study of
the older cooking fats. The objectionable features of each were
considered. The good was weighed against the bad. The strength and
weakness of each was determined. Thus was found what the ideal fat
should possess, and what it should _not_ possess. It must have every
good quality and no bad one.

After years of study, a process was discovered which made possible the
ideal fat.

The process involved the changing of the composition of vegetable food
oils and the making of the richest fat or solid _cream_.

[Illustration]

The Crisco Process at the first stage of its development gave, at
least, the basis of the ideal fat; namely, a purely _vegetable_
product, differing from all others in that absolutely no animal fat
had to be added to the vegetable oil to produce the proper stiffness.
This was but one of the many distinctive advantages sought and found.


Not Marketed Until Perfect

It also solved the problem of eliminating certain objectionable
features of fats in general, such as rancidity, color, odor, smoking
properties when heated. These weaknesses, therefore, were not a part
of this new fat, which it would seem was the parent of the Ideal.

Then after four years of severe tests, after each weakness was
replaced with strength the Government was given this fat to analyze
and classify. The report was that it answered to none of the tests for
fats already existing.


A Primary Fat

It was neither a butter, a "compound" nor a "substitute," but _an
entirely new product_. A _primary_ fat.

In 1911 it was named Crisco and placed upon the market.

Today you buy this rich, wholesome cream of nutritious food oils in
sanitary tins. The "Crisco Process" alone can produce this creamy
white fat. No one else can manufacture Crisco, because no one else
holds the secret of Crisco and because they would have no legal right
to make it. Crisco is Crisco, and nothing else.


Finally Economical

At first, it looked very much as if Crisco must be a high-priced
product. It cost its discoverers many thousands of dollars before ever
a package reached the consumer's kitchen.

Crisco was not offered for sale as a _substitute_, or for housewives
to buy only to save money. The chief point emphasized was, that
Crisco was a richer, more wholesome food fat for cooking. Naturally,
therefore, it was good news to all when Crisco was found also to be
more economical.

Crisco is more economical than lard in another way. It makes richer
pastry than lard, and one-fifth less can be used. Furthermore it can
be used over and over again in frying all manner of foods, and because
foods absorb so little, Crisco is in reality more economical even than
lard of _mediocre_ quality. The _price_ of Crisco is lower than the
average price of the best pail lard throughout the year.

[Illustration]


Crisco's Manufacture

[Illustration: COOLING IN A ROOM WITH GLASS WALLS]

[Illustration: FILLING BY MACHINERY]

[Illustration: AUTOMATIC LABELLING]

It would be difficult to imagine surroundings more appetizing than
those in which Crisco is manufactured. It is made in a building
devoted exclusively to the manufacture of this one product. In
sparkling bright rooms, cleanly uniformed employees make and pack
Crisco.

The air for this building is drawn in through an apparatus which
washes and purifies it, removing the possibility of any dust entering.

The floors are of a special tile composition; the walls are of white
glazed tile, which are washed regularly. White enamel covers metal
surfaces where nickel plating cannot be used. Sterilized machines
handle the oil and the finished product. No hand touches Crisco until
in your own kitchen the sanitary can is opened, disclosing the smooth
richness, the creamlike, appetizing consistency of the product.


The Banishment of That "Lardy" Taste in Foods

It was the earnest aim of the makers of Crisco to produce a
strictly _vegetable_ product without adding a hard, and consequently
indigestible animal fat. There is today a pronounced partiality from
a health standpoint to a vegetable fat, and the lardy, greasy taste
of food resulting from the use of animal fat never has been in such
disfavor as during the past few years.

So Crisco is absolutely _all_ vegetable. No stearine, animal
or vegetable, is added. It possesses no taste nor odor save the
delightful and characteristic aroma which identifies Crisco, and is
suggestive of its purity.


Explanation of "Hidden" Food Flavors.

When the dainty shadings of taste are over-shadowed by a "lardy"
flavor, the _true_ taste of the food itself is lost. We miss the
"hidden" or _natural_ taste of the food. Crisco has a peculiar power
of bringing out the very best in food flavors. Even the simplest foods
are allowed a delicacy of flavor.

[Illustration]

Take ginger bread for example: The real _ginger_ taste is there. The
_molasses_ and spice flavors are brought out.

[Illustration]

Or just plain, every-day fried potatoes; many never knew what the real
_potato_ taste was before eating potatoes fried in Crisco.

Fried chicken has a newness of taste not known before.

New users of Crisco should try these simple foods first and later take
up the preparation of more elaborate dishes.


Butter, Ever Popular

It is hard to imagine anything taking the place of butter upon the
dining table. For seasoning in cooking, the use of butter ever will
be largely a matter of taste. Some people have a partiality for the
"butter flavor," which after all is largely the salt mixed with the
fat. Close your eyes and eat some fresh unsalted butter; note that it
is practically tasteless.

[Illustration]

Crisco contains richer food elements than butter. As Crisco is richer,
containing no moisture, one-fifth or one-fourth less can be used in
each recipe.

Crisco always is uniform because it is a manufactured fat where
quality and purity can be controlled. It works perfectly into any
dough, making the crust or loaf even textured. It keeps sweet and pure
indefinitely in the ordinary room temperature.


Keep Your Parlor and Your Kitchen Strangers

Kitchen odors are out of place in the parlor. When frying with Crisco,
as before explained, it is not necessary to heat the fat to _smoking_
temperature, ideal frying is accomplished without bringing Crisco to
its smoking point. On the other hand, it is necessary to heat lard
"smoking hot" before it is of the proper frying temperature. Remember
also that, when lard smokes and fills the house with its strong odor,
certain constituents have been changed chemically to those which
irritate the sensitive membranes of the alimentary canal.

[Illustration: The Lard Kitchen.]

[Illustration: The Crisco Kitchen--No Smoke.]

Crisco does not smoke until it reaches 455 degrees, a heat higher
than is necessary for frying. You need not wait for Crisco to smoke.
Consequently the house will not fill with smoke, nor will there be
black, burnt specks in fried foods, as often there are when you use
lard for frying.

Crisco gives up its heat very quickly to the food submerged in it and
a tender, brown crust almost _instantly_ forms, allowing the inside of
the potatoes, croquettes, doughnuts, etc., to become _baked_, rather
than soaked.

[Illustration: Fry this, Then this, Then this--in the same Crisco.]

The same Crisco can be used for frying fish, onions, potatoes, or
any other food. Crisco does not take up food flavors or odors. After
frying each food, merely strain out the food particles.


We All Eat Raw Fats

The shortening fat in pastry or baked foods, is merely distributed
throughout the dough. No chemical change occurs during the baking
process. So when you eat pie or hot biscuit, in which animal lard
is used, _you eat raw animal lard_. The shortening used in all baked
foods therefore, should be just as pure and wholesome as if you were
eating it like butter upon bread. Because Crisco digests with such
ease, and because it is a pure vegetable fat, all those who realize
the above fact regarding pastry making are now won over to Crisco.

[Illustration]

A hint as to Crisco's purity is shown by this simple test: Break open
a hot biscuit in which Crisco has been used. You will note a sweet
fragrance, which is most inviting.

[Illustration]

A few months ago if you had told dyspeptic men and women that they
could eat pie at the evening meal and that distress would not follow,
probably they would have doubted you. Hundreds of instances of
Crisco's healthfulness have been given by people, who, at one time
have been denied such foods as pastry, cake and fried foods, but who
_now_ eat these rich, yet digestible Crisco dishes.

You, or any other normally healthy individual, whose digestion does
not relish greasy foods, can eat rich pie crust. The richness is
there, but not the unpleasant after effects. Crisco digests _readily_.


The Importance of Giving Children Crisco Foods

[Illustration]

A good digestion will mean much to the youngster's health and
character. A man seldom seems to be stronger than his stomach, for
indigestion handicaps him in his accomplishment of big things.

As more attention is given to _present_ feeding, less attention need
be given to _future_ doctoring. Equip your children with good stomachs
by giving them wholesome Crisco foods--foods which digest with ease.

They may eat the rich things they enjoy and find them just as
digestible as many apparently simple foods, if Crisco be used
properly.

They may eat Crisco doughnuts or pie without being chased by
nightmares. Sweet dreams follow the Crisco supper.

[Illustration]


The Great Variety of Crisco Foods

There are thousands of Crisco dishes. It is impossible to know the
exact number, because Crisco is used for practically every cooking
purpose. Women daily tell us of new uses they have found for Crisco.

Many women _begin_ by using Crisco in simple ways, for frying, for
baking, in place of lard. Soon, however, they learn that Crisco _also_
takes the place of butter. "Butter richness without butter expense,"
say the thousands of Crisco users.

Tasty scalloped dishes, salad dressing, rich pastry, fine grained
cake, sauces and hundreds of other dishes, where butter formerly was
used, now are prepared with Crisco.


"A Woman Can Throw Out More with a Teaspoon Than a Man Can Bring Home
in a Wagon"

[Illustration]

Kitchen expense comes by the _spoonful_. Think of the countless
spoonfuls of expensive butter used daily, where economical Crisco
would accomplish the same results at one-third the cost.

It should be remembered that one-fifth less Crisco than butter may be
used, because Crisco is _richer_ than butter. The moisture, salt and
curd which butter contains to the extent of about 20 per cent are not
found in Crisco, which is _all_, (100 per cent) shortening.

Remember also that Crisco will average _a lower price per pound
throughout the year than the best pail lard_. And you can use less
Crisco than lard, which is a further saving. [Illustration: Hotel

[Illustration: Domestic Scientists Use Crisco]


Brief, Interesting Facts

Crisco is being used in an increasing number of the better class
hotels, clubs, restaurants, dining cars, ocean liners.

Crisco has been demonstrated and explained upon the Chautauqua
platform by Domestic Science experts, these lectures being a part of
the regular course.

Domestic Science teachers recommend Crisco to their pupils and use it
in their classes and lecture demonstrations. Many High Schools having
Domestic Science departments use Crisco.

Crisco has taken the place of butter and lard in a number of
hospitals, where purity and digestibility are of _vital_ importance.

[Illustration: Hospital Dietetic Class]

Crisco is Kosher. Rabbi Margolies of New York, said that the Hebrew
Race had been waiting 4,000 years for Crisco. It conforms to the
strict Dietary Laws of the Jews. It is what is known in the Hebrew
language as a "parava," or neutral fat. Crisco can be used with
both "milchig" and "fleichig" (milk and flesh) foods. Special Kosher
packages, bearing the seals of Rabbi Margolies of New York, and Rabbi
Lifsitz of Cincinnati, are sold the Jewish trade. But all Crisco is
Kosher and all of the same purity.

[Illustration: The Kosher Seal]

Campers find Crisco helpful in many ways. Hot climates have little
effect upon its wholesomeness.

It is convenient; a handy package to pack and does not melt so quickly
in transit. One can of Crisco can be used to fry fish, eggs, potatoes
and to make hot biscuit, merely by straining out the food particles
after each frying and pouring the Crisco back into the can to harden
to proper consistency before the biscuit making.

[Illustration]

Practically every grocer who has a good trade in Crisco, uses it in
his own home.

Crisco is sold by net weight. You pay _only_ for the Crisco--not the
can. Find the net weight of what you have been using.

Bread and cake keep fresh and moist much longer when Crisco is used.

Crisco's Manufacture Scientifically Explained

To understand something of the Crisco Process, it is necessary first
to know that there are three main constituents in all the best edible
oils.

Linoline, Oleine, Stearine.

The chemical difference between these three components is solely
in the percentage of hydrogen contained, and it is possible by the
addition of hydrogen, to transform one component into another.

Though seemingly so much alike, there is a marked difference in the
physical properties of these components.

Linoline which has the lowest percentage of hydrogen, is unstable and
tends to turn rancid.

Oleine is stable, has no tendency to turn rancid and is easily
digested.

Stearine is both hard and indigestible.

The Crisco process adds enough hydrogen to change almost all the
linoline into nourishing digestible oleine.

Mark well the difference in manufacture between Crisco and lard
compounds. In producing a lard compound, to the linoline, oleine and
stearine of the original oil is added more stearine (usually animal),
the hard indigestible fat, in order to bring up the hardness of the
oil. The resultant compound is indigestible and very liable to become
rancid.

The following pages contain 615 recipes which have been tested by
Domestic Science Authorities in the Cooking Departments of different
colleges and other educational institutions, and by housewives in
their own kitchens. Many have been originated by Marion Harris Neil
and _all_ have been tested by her.

We have undertaken to submit a comprehensive list of recipes for your
use, which will enable you to serve menus of wide variety.

We hope that you have enjoyed reading this little volume and that you
will derive both help and satisfaction from the recipes.

We will go to any length to help you in the cause of Better Food. We
realize that women must study this product as they would any other
altogether new article of cookery, and that the study and care used
will be amply repaid by the palatability and healthfulness of all
foods. A can of Crisco is no Aladdin's Lamp, which merely need be
touched by a kitchen spoon to produce magical dishes. But _any_ woman
is able to achieve excellent results by mixing thought with Crisco.

_Things to Remember in Connection with These Recipes_


No need for Crisco to occupy valuable space in the refrigerator.
In fact, except in most unusual summer heat, it will be of a better
consistency outside the refrigerator. Crisco keeps sweet indefinitely,
summer and winter, at ordinary room temperature.

[Illustration: Use level measurements]

In making sauces, thoroughly blend the flour and Crisco before adding
the milk.

In using melted Crisco in boiled dressing, croquettes, rolls,
fritters, etc., be sure that the melted Crisco is cooled sufficiently
so that the hot fat will not injure the texture of the foods.

When using in place of butter, add salt in the proportion of one level
teaspoonful to one cup of Crisco.

Remember that Crisco, like butter, is susceptible to cold. It readily
becomes hard. In creaming Crisco in winter use the same care as when
creaming butter. Rinse pan in boiling water and have the Crisco of
the proper creaming stiffness before using. Unlike butter, however,
Crisco's purity is not affected by weather. It remains sweet and pure
indefinitely without refrigeration.

In deep frying, do not wait for Crisco to smoke. (See page 35.)




_Remember That_--


_When pie crust is tough:_ It is possible you have not used Crisco
properly. Perhaps the measurements were not correct. Perhaps the water
was too warm, or the dough was handled too much. Shortening cannot
make pastry tough.

_When fried foods absorb:_ It is because Crisco is not hot enough, or
because you have not used enough Crisco. Use plenty and the raw foods,
if added in small quantities, will not reduce the heat of the fat. The
absorption in deep Crisco frying should be less than that of another
fat.

_When cake is not a success:_ It is not the fault of the Crisco.
Either too much was used, the oven heat not perfectly controlled or
some important ingredient was used in the wrong proportion. Crisco
should be creamed with the sugar more thoroughly than butter, as
Crisco contains no moisture to dissolve the sugar.

_When cake or other food is not flavory:_ Salt should have been added
to the Crisco, for Crisco contains no salt.

_When there is smoke in the kitchen:_ Crisco has been burned or heated
too high for frying. Or some may have been on the _outside_ of the pan
or kettle.

_When Crisco is too hard:_ Like butter, it is susceptible to heat and
cold. Simply put in a warmer place.




_Hints to Young Cooks_

_Also, How to Choose Foods, Methods of Cooking, Cooking Time Table,
The Art of Carving_, by MARION HARRIS NEIL.


Before commencing to cook, look up the required recipe, read and think
it out. Note down on a slip of paper the materials and quantities
required. Collect all utensils and materials required before
commencing. Success in cookery depends on careful attention to every
detail from start to finish. Quantities, both liquid and dry, should
be exact. Small scales and weights should form part of the kitchen
equipment where possible, and the measuring cups cost so little that
no one need be without them.

Throughout this book the measurements are level

_How to Choose Foods_

Money can be spent to infinitely better advantage in the store, than
by giving orders at the door, by phone or mail. Every housekeeper
knows how large a proportion of the housekeeping money is swallowed up
by the butcher's bill, so that with the meat item careful selection is
most necessary in order to keep the bills within bounds.

In choosing meat of any kind the eye, the nose and the touch really
are required, although it is not appetizing to see the purchaser use
more than the eye.


Beef

In choosing meat it should be remembered that without being actually
unwholesome, it varies greatly in quality, and often an inferior joint
is to be preferred from a first class beast to a more popular cut from
a second class animal. To be perfect the animal should be five or six
years old, the flesh of a close even grain, bright red in color and
well mixed with creamy white fat, the suet being firm and a clear
white. Heifer meat is smaller in the bone and lighter in color than
ox beef. Cow beef is much the same to look at as ox beef, though being
older it is both coarser in the grain and tougher; bull beef, which
is never seen however, in a first class butcher's may be recognized by
the coarseness and dark color of the flesh, and also by a strong and
almost rank smell.


Mutton

To be in perfection, mutton should be at least four, or better five
or six years old, but sheep of this age are rarely if ever, met with
now-a-days, when they are constantly killed under two years. To know
the age of mutton, examine the breast bones; if these are all of a
white gristly color the animal was four years old or over, while the
younger it is the pinkier are the bones, which, in a sheep of under a
year, are entirely red.

Good mutton should be of a clear dark red, the fat firm and white,
and not too much of it; when touched the meat should feel crisp yet
tender. If the fat is yellow and the lean flabby and damp, it is bad.
A freshly scraped wooden skewer run into the meat along the bone
will speedily enable anyone to detect staleness. For roasting mutton
scarcely can be hung too long, as long as it is not tainted; but for
boiling it must not be kept nearly so long or the meat will be of a
bad color when cooked.


Lamb

The freshness of lamb is comparatively easy to distinguish, as if
fresh the neck vein will be a bright blue, the knuckles stiff, and the
eyes bright and full.


Veal

Veal is at its best when the calf is from three to four months old.
The meat should be of a close firm grain, white in color and the fat
inclining to a pinkish tinge. Veal is sometimes coarser in the grain,
and redder in the flesh, not necessarily a mark of inferiority, but
denoting the fact that calf has been brought up in the open. Like all
young meat, veal turns very quickly, therefore it never should hang
more than two or three days. In choosing veal always examine the suet
under the kidney; if this be clammy and soft, with a faint odor, the
meat is not good, and always reject any that has greenish or yellowish
spots about it. The head should be clean skinned and firm, the eyes
full and clear, the kidneys large and well covered with fat, the liver
a rich dark clear color, free from any spots or gristle, while the
sweetbreads should be firm, plump, of a delicate color, and free from
strings.


Pork

The flesh of pork, when in good condition, is a delicate pinky white,
with a close fine grain; the fat, which should not be too abundant, of
a white color, very faintly tinged with pink; the skin should be thin
and elastic to the touch, and the flesh generally cool, clean, and
smooth looking; if, on the contrary, the flesh is flabby and clammy
when touched, it is not fresh.

Pork, like all white meat, is quick to taint, and never should be kept
long before cooking. If you have the slightest doubt about pork, it is
best to reject it, for unlike other meat which may be quite wholesome
and usable, though not of precisely prime quality, pork _must_ be
in really first class condition to be wholesome, and therefore it
is impossible to be too particular in the choice of it. Always if
possible look at the tongue, for, as in beef, this is a very fair
criterion of the condition of the animal; a freshly scraped new
wooden skewer run into the meat along the bone is a good test of the
freshness of the pork, and be careful especially to examine the fat,
for if there be little kernels in it the pork is "measly," a very
common disease among pigs, and one particularly unwholesome to the
consumer.

Pigs for fresh pork should be of medium size, not over fat, and
under a year old. Pigs destined to become bacon are usually older and
larger. Sucking pigs should be small, and are best when about three
weeks old. A sucking pig should be cooked as soon as possible after
it is killed, as it taints very quickly; unless fresh, no care in the
cooking will make the crackling crisp, as it should be.


Ham--Bacon

Good bacon has the lean of a bright pink and fine in the grain, while
the fat is white and firm. If the lean is high colored, it probably
has been over salted and is old besides, and in consequence will
be hard and salty; while if there be yellow marks in the fat, and
a curious, rather musty smell, it will have an unpleasant taste. In
choosing a ham always run a clean knife or skewer in at the knuckle,
and also at the center; if it comes out clean and smelling sweet,
the ham is good; but if out of order the blade of the knife will be
smeared and greasy looking, and have a disagreeable, strong odor.


Venison

The condition of venison is judged chiefly by the fat, which should be
a clear creamy white color, and close in texture. Always try venison
by running a sharp knife along the haunch bone, which is usually the
first to turn; if, in taking it out, the knife has a blackish-green
look and an unpleasant odor, the meat is tainted, and unfit for use.
Venison requires to be kept a considerable time before it is in proper
condition, and needs great care in its management. It must be examined
carefully every day, and if there is the slightest doubt, it should
be washed in lukewarm milk and water, then dried in clean cloths, and
when perfectly dry, should be covered thickly all over with ground
ginger and pepper; when required for use, dust off the pepper and
ginger, and wash the meat in a little lukewarm water, and dry it
thoroughly. Venison, like mutton, improves with age, and this can be
judged by the condition of the hoof, which in a young animal has a
small, smooth cleft, while in an old one it is deeply cut and rugged.
The haunch is the prime joint, its perfection depending on the greater
or less depth of the fat on it. The neck and shoulder also are very
good. They are used chiefly for stews or pies.


Hares and Rabbits

A hare when fresh killed is stiff and red; when stale, the body is
supple and the flesh in many parts black. If the hare be old the
ears will be tough and dry, and will not tear readily. Rabbits may
be judged in the same manner. In both, the claws should be smooth and
sharp. In a young hare the cleft in the lip is narrow, and the claws
are cracked readily if turned sideways.


Poultry

Poultry to be perfect, should have just reached their full growth (the
only exceptions to this are "spring chickens," ducklings, goslings,
etc., which are considered delicacies at certain seasons); they should
be plump, firm fleshed, and not over fatted. Over-fed fowls are often
a mass of greasy fat, which melts in the cooking and spoils the flavor
of the bird. A hen is at her best just before she begins to lay; her
legs should be smooth, her comb small, bright, and soft. A young cock
has the comb full, bright colored, and smooth, the legs smooth, the
spurs short, and in both the toes should break easily when turned
back, and the weight of the birds should be great in proportion to
their size. Contrary to the practice with game, poultry never should
be kept long, as they turn easily, and are spoilt if the least high.
They also require longer cooking, in proportion to their size, than
game, and never should be underdone. Dark-legged fowls are best for
roasting, as their flesh is moister and better flavored cooked in this
way than the white-legged ones, which from their greater daintiness of
appearance are to be preferred for boiling.

_Turkeys_ should be plump, white-fleshed, young, the legs plump and
firm, black and smooth, with (in the cock) short spurs, the feet soft
and supple; the eyes should be full and clear, the neck long, and
the wattles of a bright color. A hen turkey is best for boiling.
Like fowls, an old turkey is fit for nothing but the stewpan or the
stockpot. Turkeys require hanging for at least a week, though they
must never be "high" or "gamey."

_Geese_ always should be chosen young, plump, and full breasted, a
white skin, a yellow smooth bill, the feet yellow and pliable. If the
feet and bill are red and hard, and the skin hairy and coarse, the
bird is old. Geese should be hung for a few days. Ducks, like geese,
should have yellow, supple feet; the breasts full and hard, and the
skin clear. Wild ducks should be fat, the feet small, reddish, and
pliable, the breast firm and heavy. If not fresh, there will be a
disagreeable smell when the bill is open. The male is generally the
more expensive, though the female is usually more delicate in flavor.

_Pigeons_ always should be young and extremely fresh, and when so,
they are plump and fat, with pliable smooth feet.

NOTE--In selecting game pluck a few feathers from the under part of
the leg; if the skin is not discolored the bird is fresh. The age may
be known by placing the thumb into the beak, and holding the bird up
with the jaw apart; if it breaks it is young; if not, it is old, and
requires longer keeping before cooking to be eatable.

_Guinea-fowl_ are judged like poultry, but require hanging for some
time.


Fish

Fish in good condition usually is firm and elastic to the touch, eyes
bright and prominent, gills fresh and rosy. If the fish is flabby,
with sunken eyes, it either is stale or out of condition.

_Salmon_ should have a small head and tail, full thick shoulders,
clean silvery scales, and its flesh of a rich yellowish pink. When
quite fresh there is a creamy curd between the flakes, which are stiff
and hard; but if kept this melts, softening the flesh and rendering it
richer, but at the same time less digestible.

_Trout_, in spite of the difference in size, may be judged by the
same rule as salmon. However, it will not bear keeping, deteriorating
rapidly.

_Cod_, unlike salmon, should have a large head and thick shoulders;
the flesh being white and clear, and separating easily into large
flakes, the skin clean and silvery. Most people consider cod improves
by being kept for a day or two and very slightly salted.

_Herrings_ must be absolutely fresh to be good, and when in this state
their scales shine like silver. If kept over long their eyes become
suffused with blood.

_Mackerel_ also must be quite fresh. They never should be bought
if either out of condition or season. If fresh they are peculiarly
beautiful fish, their backs of an iridescent blue green barred with
black, and their bellies of a pearly whiteness.

_Smelts_ should be stiff and silvery, with a delicate perfume faintly
suggestive of cucumber.

_Halibut_ is a wholesome fish. It should be middling size, thick and
of a white color.

_Lobsters, Crabs, Prawns, and Shrimps_ are stiff, and with the tails
tightly pressed against the body. With the former, weight is a great
guide, as the heavier they are the better; but if there be the least
sign of wateriness, they should be rejected at once.


Vegetables

Green vegetables always are at their best when cheapest and most
plentiful. Out of season they never have the same flavor, however well
they may be grown. Excepting artichokes, all summer vegetables,
as lettuce, peas, beans, and asparagus should be cooked as soon as
possible after gathering. The freshness of most vegetables may be
ascertained easily by taking a leaf or a pod between the fingers. If
fresh this will snap off short and crisp, while if stale it will be
limp and soft. It is an economy to buy winter vegetables, such as
carrots, parsnips, turnips, beets, celery, and potatoes in large
quantities, if you have storage room, as if buried in sand and kept
from the frost they may be kept a considerable time. Onions should
be kept hung up in a cool, dry place. If allowed to sprout the flavor
becomes rank and coarse.


Eggs

A mode of ascertaining the freshness of eggs is to hold them before a
lighted candle or to the light, and if the egg looks clear, it will
be tolerably good; if thick, it is stale; and if there is a black
spot attached to the shell, it is worthless. No egg should be used for
culinary purposes with the slightest taint in it, as it will render
perfectly useless those with which it has been mixed. Eggs may be
preserved, however, for a considerable time without any further
special precaution than that of keeping them in a cool place. A very
effective method of preserving eggs for winter use is to rub a little
melted Crisco over each to close the pores, and then to pack the eggs
in bran, salt or sawdust, not allowing them to touch each other.

_Methods of Cooking_


There are seven chief methods of cooking meat--roasting, boiling,
baking, stewing, frying, broiling and poaching.

The first three are most suitable for joints weighing four pounds
or more, but not satisfactory for smaller pieces which are liable to
become hard and flavorless by the drying up or loss of their juices.

Of the other three methods, stewing may be applied to fairly large and
solid pieces, but it is better for smaller thin ones, while frying and
broiling can be used only for steaks, chops, and similar cuts.

Braising and steaming are combinations and modifications of these
methods.


Roasting

Roasting is one of the oldest methods of cooking on record, and still
remains the favorite form of cooking joints of meat or birds. The
success of every method of cooking depends largely upon the correct
management of the fire. In roasting, this is particularly the case,
as a clear, brisk and yet steady fire is needed. To roast a joint it
should be placed before great heat for the first ten minutes and then
allowed to cook more slowly. The great heat hardens the outside of the
meat and keeps in the juices. If allowed to cook quickly all the time
the meat is likely to be tough. The fire should be bright and clear.
The joint should be basted about every ten minutes, as this helps to
cook it, keeps it juicy and improves the flavor. The time allowed
is fifteen minutes for every pound, twenty minutes over for beef and
mutton; for veal and pork twenty minutes for every pound and thirty
minutes over.


Oven Roasting

Roasting in the oven of ordinary coal stoves or ranges is not
considered so good as roasting before an open fire; nevertheless it
may be said safely that the greatest part of meat roasting is done in
close ovens. It appears, from various experiments that meat roasted or
baked in a close oven loses rather less of its weight than if roasted
by an open fire.

The excellence of a roast depends to a great extent upon the amount of
basting it receives.

Some cooks season a joint before it is cooked, while others season it
with salt and pepper just before it is served. There is a difference
of opinion as to which is the more correct way of the two. Meat of
newly killed animals requires longer cooking than meat which has been
hung for a time.

In warm weather joints require slightly less time for roasting than in
cold.

Boned and rolled or stuffed meats require longer cooking than the same
joints would if neither rolled nor stuffed. The meat of young animals
and that of old ones requires different treatment. As a rule young
flesh, containing less fibrine, requires longer cooking. White meat,
such as pork, veal and lamb, always should be well cooked and never
must be served rare. The exact time and process of roasting must
be left to the good management of the cook, who must be guided by
circumstances and conditions. The cook's business is to serve the
joint as full of nourishing qualities as possible. Though roasting is
considered one of the easiest and most simple processes of cookery, it
really requires quite as much attention to obtain perfect results as
is necessary to prepare so-called "made" dishes, the recognized test
for good cooks.


Boiling

Boiling (of fresh meat).--This is cookery by immersion in boiling
liquid, which after a few minutes is reduced to simmering. The object
of the high temperature at first is to harden the surface albumen and
so seal the pores and prevent the escape of the juices. If continued
too long, this degree of heat would tend to toughen the joint
throughout; after the first few minutes, therefore, the heat must be
reduced to about 180 deg. F. The pan used for boiling meat should be only
just large enough to hold the joint, and the quantity of liquid no
more than is required to cover it. For the boiling of salt meat the
general rule of first hardening the surface is not to be followed. The
salting of meat withdraws a large proportion of its juices, while at
the same time the salt hardens the fibres, and this hardness would
be intensified by extreme heat. Very salt meat sometimes is soaked in
cold water to extract some of the salt, but whether this is done or
not, the rule for boiling salt meat is to immerse it in cold or tepid
water and bring slowly to boiling point; boil for five minutes to seal
the pores and prevent any further loss of juice, then reduce to 180 deg.
F., and maintain a uniform temperature till the meat is cooked. Salt
meat takes longer to cook than fresh meat, and the saltness may be
qualified by boiling vegetables with the meat, turnips especially
being useful for this purpose.


Baking

The actual differences between roasting and baking are not great, the
terms being frequently interchanged. Meat loses rather less weight
when baked than when roasted, but the flavor of meat is inferior
and less developed. The heat of an oven being steadier, baking takes
somewhat less time than roasting. In a gas oven having an open
floor the current of air is not impeded, and such baking very nearly
approaches roasting, and the flavor generally is acknowledged to be
the same.


Stewing

Stewing is cooking slowly with a small quantity of liquid in a covered
vessel. The method is specially suitable for the coarser and cheaper
parts of meat, which are rendered tender without loss of their juices.
The usual plan is to make a gravy flavored and colored to suit the
stew, and after the ingredients are well blended and cooked to lay
the meat in the boiling liquid. After about two minutes boiling,
the temperature is reduced to simmering, about 160 deg. F., a lower
temperature than that required for a large joint of "boiled" meat. The
time depends greatly on the quality of the meat, but none will stew
satisfactorily in less than from one and a half to two hours, and the
longer allowance is to be preferred.


Broiling

Broiling, sometimes called grilling, is cooking by the direct action
of fire brought almost into contact with the meat. The outer surface
is burned or seared, the albumen hardened and the juices, which have
a tendency to escape on the side turned from the heat, are retained
in the meat by frequent turning. The fire for broiling must be very
clear, intensely hot and high in the grate. The utensil required for
broiling is a gridiron, the bars of which are greased and heated to
prevent sticking and subsequent tearing of the meat. The gridiron is
laid quite close over the heat, so that the lower surface is dried and
hardened at once.

The meat must be turned at very short intervals before the juices have
been driven from the heat to the opposite surface. If once allowed to
reach the surface, they will be thrown off in turning and lost, the
meat being correspondingly impoverished. By constant turning the
juices are kept moving backwards and forwards, and the meat remains
moist and full of flavor. Each side should be exposed to the fire
about three times, and it is not desirable to use meat less than one
inch or more than one and a half to two inches thick for the purpose.

The thinner pieces should have even greater heat applied than the
thick ones, as the longer thin ones are exposed to the fire the
more dry and tasteless they become, while the thicker pieces may be
slightly withdrawn after thoroughly hardening the surface and cooked
rather more slowly that the heat may penetrate to the center. The
frequent turning must be continued, or the juices will reach the
hardened outer fibres, soften them, and escape.

If a double broiler is used the turning is managed easily, but with a
single gridiron care must be taken not to puncture the meat by using
a fork. Steak tongs are made for the purpose of lifting and turning
broiled meat, but a spoon or a spoon and knife will answer. A single
rim of fat on the chop or steak will tend to keep the edge moist and
baste the meat, but too much will cause flame to rise in continuous
jet, making the surface smoky. If there is absolutely no fat on
the piece to be broiled, morsels of finely chopped suet may be
occasionally thrown into the fire, so the sudden spurt of flame from
this source leaves a deposit of fat on the meat which improves the
flavor, and, without softening the albumen, prevents its becoming
uneatably hard and dry.


Frying

Frying may be looked on as a derivative of broiling, and passes by
easy stages, from broiling on a slightly greased metal plate, or
_sauteing_ in a shallow pan in a small quantity of Crisco, to cooking
by actual immersion into a bath of hot fat. In a house where small
and delicately made dishes are in demand, and where variety in the
re-dressing of cold meats has to be studied, this frying in deep fat
is one of the cook's most needed accomplishments. Though exceedingly
easy to do well, it is also exceedingly easy to do badly.

Deep fat frying, which means submerging the food in the fat, is far
superior to shallow or saute frying, and can be done most economically
with Crisco. Little is absorbed by the foods, and the Crisco does
not take up the odor or flavor of the food which is fried in it. This
characteristic makes it possible to use Crisco for frying one article
of food after another.

Use _plenty_ of Crisco for frying. The temperature of the hot Crisco
then will be but little lowered when the food is added. There is
little absorption and what is left may be used for _all_ frying,
merely by straining out food particles after each frying.

Sufficient Crisco should be put into the pan to fill it about
two-thirds full. From two to three pounds for a pan eight inches
in diameter will not be too much. Into this pan or kettle a wire
"frying-basket" should fit quite loosely, the basket measuring quite
an inch less across the top than the pan.

Let Crisco get hot gradually in the pan. Do not put into an already
hot container. No fat should be treated in this manner.




Do Not Wait for Crisco to Smoke


Heat Crisco until a crumb of bread becomes a golden brown in

60 seconds for raw dough mixtures, as crullers, fritters, etc.

40 seconds for cooked mixtures, as croquettes, codfish balls, etc.

20 seconds for French fried potatoes.

Seconds may be counted thus: one hundred and one, one hundred and two,
etc.

The fat may be tested also by dropping into it a little piece of the
article to be cooked. When it rises to the top, bubbles vigorously and
browns quickly, the fat is hot enough.

When prepared, the foods must be placed in the basket, not too many
at a time or too close together, and then lowered gently into the fat.
They generally will sink to the bottom for a minute or two, and only
float when they have begun to brown. When a bright golden brown, take
up the basket and let the fried things drain in it, over the hot fat,
for a few seconds. Then take them out gently one by one, and lay them
on a sheet of brown or kitchen paper.

The draining over the pan is one of the principal things to attend
to; if this be neglected, the fat will cling about the fried things,
making them both look and taste greasy, whereas if properly drained
in the basket to begin with, they will afterwards scarcely mark the
paper. When, as is sometimes the case, no frying basket is used, each
thing fried should be drained between a spoon and the edge of the pan.


To Clarify

It is economy to use three pounds in the kettle, clarifying the fat
when it is put away. To clarify Crisco, take that which has been used
for deep frying and when it has cooled, but not solidified, strain
through a double thickness of cheese cloth, replace kettle on stove,
drop several slices of potato into the Crisco and reheat. When the
potatoes are golden brown, take out and pour the Crisco back into the
tin. With this little care, fish, oysters, onions, chops, fritters,
doughnuts, etc., may be fried over and over again in the same Crisco.

The dry or saute method of frying is less satisfactory, in that it
is difficult even after much practice to produce a uniformly colored
surface. A small quantity of fat only is needed, and where the fat,
i.e., the heat, ends, a crack is formed in the outer coat, through
which flavor escapes and fat enters; the appearance also is rendered
unsightly. Flat fish can be fried fairly well by this method, or,
indeed, almost any thin substance, as thin edges are not affected in
this way. For pancakes and other articles of similar nature it is the
best method. It rarely is possible to use the fat from the dry method
a second time, except for dishes of the same kind, as the fat always
is more or less flavored by the food cooked in it. The most digestible
fat for frying and the best for results undoubtedly is Crisco.


Steaming

Steaming is a process very similar to boiling, for it is cooking in
the heated vapor of water. This practice as a means of cookery is
largely adopted in hotels, clubs, schools and hospitals, and other
large institutions; also frequently applied in ordinary home cookery
for particular articles of food requiring a very slow process of
cooking. An ordinary kitchen steamer, with a close-fitting lid is
generally all that is required for simple household cookery on a small
scale. The articles of food which are to be steamed are prepared in
exactly the same manner as for boiling. Many puddings, some meats, and
some vegetables are considered better if cooked by steam, and inasmuch
as the process of cooking is a very slow one, there is no fear of
the food being destroyed by too fierce a heat, as the temperature in
steaming never reaches beyond 212 deg. F. Fish, meat and poultry cooked by
steam are as a rule tender, full of gravy and digestible. By steaming,
watery vegetables are made drier; tough meats are softened and made
tender; while farinaceous mixtures and puddings develop a totally
different flavor when baked or fried.


Braising

Braising is a combination of roasting and stewing small joints of
meat in a shallow stewpan. It is a favorite method of cooking with
the French, and is supposed to bring out an unusually fine flavor and
aroma. The pan in which a braise is to be made always should be lined
with slices of bacon, carrot, onions and herbs, upon which the meat is
placed. It usually is moistened with stock or stock and wine. The
more delicate meats, such as sweetbreads, fillets, fowls and turkeys
sometimes are covered with buttered paper; this is done to prevent
the heat from the top of the pan scorching or imparting too much of a
roast flavor to the meats which are to be braised. Occasional basting
during the process of this method of cooking is essential. When done,
the meat is taken up, the fat removed from the vegetables and gravy,
which latter is then reduced, strained and blended with some kind of
gravy or thin sauce.


Poaching and Marinating

Poaching is the name usually given to the process of cooking an
article by placing it for a few minutes in boiling water. Marinating
or pickling is a process with a formidable name with a simple meaning.
To marinate simply is to soak meat in a mixture for some hours, or
even days, with the idea of improving its flavor of softening its
fibres and making it tender. Vinegar, oil, pepper and salt are mixed
together and the meat packed in the mixture; sometimes a sliced onion
and herbs are added. The meat, of course, should be wiped first, but
not washed.


Cooking in Earthenware

Stone or earthenware cooking appliances are used to very great
advantage for various forms of preparing food. For the homely
_pot-au-feu_ the French housewife has used fireproof earthenware
dishes for generations, and does so today. But besides soups, various
savory dishes, and all sorts of stews are cooked in stoneware pots.
Indeed, so much has this form of cookery come into fashion that many
dishes are sent to table in the pots in which they are cooked. Cooking
in stoneware has no equal where slow cooking is aimed at, and there
are many dishes which one would do well to refrain from attempting
unless cooked in this fashion. These cooking pots are inexpensive,
and certain foods taste decidedly better if cooked in this way. For
braising, pot roasting, or stewing fruit and other articles which need
to be cooked slowly under close cover, the application of a moderate,
even heat produces far better results than if quick heat is applied.
For such cases the use of earthenware cooking pots is recommended.

All materials are measured level, i.e., by filling spoon or cup more
than full and leveling with a case knife.

To measure meal, flour, sugar and similar ingredients, sift lightly
into the measure, then level.

Standard measuring cups made of tin, aluminum or glass holding half
a pint always should be used. Coffee and teacups vary so much that
correct proportions can not be obtained by using them.

To measure a spoonful of dry material, fill the spoon heaping, then
level. To measure a half-spoonful, fill and level the spoon, then
divide in half lengthways; for quarter-spoonfuls, divide the halves
crossways.

_Use level measurements in all recipes in this book._




_The Art of Carving_


Carving is an art, and one which anybody, with a knowledge of a few
general directions, can acquire easily.

A proper set of carving tools is almost indispensable, and should
comprise: a good thin, sharp-bladed knife, a solid two or three
pronged fork, and a pair of carving scissors. Anything that needs to
be carved at table should be placed on a dish sufficiently large
to allow the joint to be turned without moving the dish from its
position. The dish should be placed close in front of the carver.
Such joints as beef, veal and ham should be cut very thin; while lamb,
mutton, and pork should be cut a trifle thicker.

_To carve a fowl_, begin by sticking the fork into the pinion and draw
it towards the leg; and then, passing the knife underneath, take off
the wing at the joint. Next slip the knife between leg and body, to
cut through the joint; and with the fork turn leg back, and joint will
give way. Then take off other wing and leg. After legs are taken off,
enter knife into the top of breast, and cut under merrythought or
wishbone so as to loosen it, lifting it with the fork. Afterwards cut
slices from both sides of breast. Next, take off collarbones, which
lie on each side of wishbone and then separate side bones from the
back. The breast and wings are considered the most delicate parts; the
back as the least desirable, generally is left on platter.

_A turkey_ is carved in same manner, except that the legs and wings,
being larger, are separated at lower joint. Lower part of leg (or
drumstick) being hard, tough, and stringy, usually is allowed to
remain on platter. First cut off wing, leg, and breast from one side;
then turn turkey round and cut them off from the other.

_To carve a goose_, separate leg from body by putting fork into small
end of leg, pressing it close to body, and then passing knife under,
and turning leg back as you cut through joint. To take off wing, put
fork into the small end of wing, and press it closely to body, then
slip knife under and separate the joint. Next, cut under wishbone and
take it off, and cut slices from breast. Then turn and dismember the
other side. Take off upper side bones next to wings, then two lower
side bones. The breast and legs of a goose are considered the most
choice. If a goose is old, there is no fowl so tough.

_Quails_ merely are split down the back, as also are pigeons, giving a
half to each person.

_To carve loin of mutton,_ a portion is cut through, beginning at the
best end. If kidney be in it, a slice should be served as far as it
will go to each portion. Care must be taken that the bone is well
jointed. The butcher chops the loin between each vertebra. When big
mutton is carved it gives a large chop, oftentimes more than the
amount desired, but a chop cannot be divided without waste, or one
portion being all the inferior end. It is therefore a good plan to
joint a loin of mutton with a small meat saw, cutting any thickness
desired. In this case the actual bone will often have to be sawn
through. The result will be more economical, and the servings more
agreeable. The loin also can be boned entirely, stuffed or not, as
preferred, the flap end folded and fastened over the fillet portion.
Then the meat can be carved across any thickness.

_To carve leg of mutton,_ stand joint the inner part of the leg
uppermost and cut across center to bone, towards carver, then cut
rather thick slices on either side. To serve the meat equally, unless
any special part is desired, a portion of the knuckle is served with
a slice of the thick end. The prime fat is the kernel of fat at the
thick end.

_To carve forequarter of mutton or lamb._ The forequarter of mutton
usually is not served whole unless the mutton be very small. The
forequarter of lamb frequently is served whole. Before cooking it
must be jointed through the chine of bone at the back, to enable this
portion being served in chops, twice across the breastbones the entire
length, and at short intervals at the edge of the breast. Before
serving it is usual to separate the shoulder by pressing the fork
in by the knuckle, then passing knife round shoulder, crossing about
center of joint, raising shoulder without cutting too much meat off
breast. Leave shoulder in position on joint; a second dish is sent to
table on which to lay it while the other part is being carved.

_To carve rabbit or hare._ In either case first separate legs and
shoulders; then cut the back part across, into two parts. This is
accomplished best by inserting the knife into joint, and raising up
the back by means of the fork. The back or fillet part is considered
the best portion of a hare or rabbit.

_To carve sirloin of beef,_ a sirloin should be cut into thin slices
with a sharp, firm cut from end to end of the joint. At the upper
portion the cut should be clean and even; then use point of knife to
loosen slices from bones. In carving undercut, remove superfluous fat,
and cut slices from end to end in same manner as upper portion. Be
careful always to cut down straight to the bone of a sirloin or rib
of beef; by so doing you will not spoil appearance of joint, and what
remains will look tidy.

_To carve ham._ Ham should be cut through to the bone first from
center or near thin end. Slices must be cut thin. Always commence
cutting from upper side. The fairest way by far, so as to serve fat
and lean evenly, is to begin cutting from center of thickest part, and
to cut thin circular slices; by this means the flavor of the ham
is far better, and it will prove to be the more economical way of
serving.

_To carve ox-tongue._ Commence cutting from middle of tongue; cut
slices not too thin and take them from each side being careful not to
cut slices through to bottom part of tongue. Extreme end of the tip
and the lower part of tongue generally are used up for chopping in
salpicons, etc. A little of the fat should be put on each plate. When
rolled tongue is served it must be cut horizontally into rather thin
slices.

_To carve fish._ A silver sheer or trowel should be used for this
purpose; a steel knife applied to fish often spoils the delicacy of
its flavor. Great care must be taken to prevent breaking the flakes,
which ought to be kept as entire as possible. Short-grained fish, such
as salmon, etc., should be cut lengthwise, not crosswise.

SOUPS


An economical housewife may supply good gravy and thick soups at
very little, if any, addition to the weekly expenses, as soups are
an excellent method of using up scraps and bones from joints and
vegetables that otherwise are wasted. Soup, if taken as the primary
course of a substantial dinner, if well flavored and warm, acts as a
stimulant in the stomach, exciting the gastric glands, and generally
enabling that organ to perform its functions more easily. For this
object the soup should be thin and not too much of it partaken,
otherwise it dilutes the digestive juices too much. If it is to
form the chief part of the meal, the soup will be more nutritious if
thickened, especially so, if pulse--i.e. peas, beans, and lentils--is
used as the thickening medium.

Stock is the liquid in which meat, bones, or vegetables have been
cooked, and which contains an extract from these substances. It is
used for soups, sauces, and gravies. Fresh or cooked bones or meat may
be used. A stock pot may be kept on the stove, into which are put any
scraps of meat, bones, gristle, or vegetable; at the end of the day it
is strained, and all fat taken off. Bones and meat for stock must be
broken into small pieces. Cold water should be used, and a little
salt to extract the nutriment. The whole must be brought slowly to the
boiling point; then, the temperature lowered, the fat and scum taken
off. When wanted for clear soups the vegetables should be cleaned,
but not cut up, or with the long cooking they may mash and thicken the
soup. In hot weather it is better to leave out the vegetables, as
the stock turns sour more quickly if vegetables have been used in its
preparation. They can be cooked separately and added when using the
stock.

[Illustration]

The soup should simmer for five or six hours to extract the gelatinous
matters. If the stock is skimmed occasionally it will be much clearer.
Keep the lid on the stock pot to prevent loss by evaporation. The
bones can be cooked again next day for a second stock, but the
vegetables must be taken out. Care must be taken that nothing doubtful
in freshness be put into the stock pot. Meat and bones should be well
wiped with a damp cloth before using them. If onions be put in the
soup unpeeled, simply washed and the root end cut off, they will help
to color the soup. When using eggs for other dishes, if the shells be
washed before breaking them and added to the stock pot they will help
to clear the soup. For clear soups care must be taken that nothing
of a floury nature be added to the stock pot. Stock always should
be strained before cooling. Never allow it to stand in stock pot
all night. Clear gravy soup consists of the extractives, flavoring
matters, and gelatine of meat and bones.

Consomme is a good stock made from beef, veal, and often fowl, and
flavored with vegetables, cooled, freed from fat. It is clarified with
whites and shells of eggs, and chopped raw lean beef, and strained
through a cloth. It should be brilliantly clear and of a pale brown
color. Any fat floating on the stock may be removed by passing a piece
of kitchen or blotting paper over the surface. Soup left from a meal
will keep better if strained from the vegetables that have been served
in it. In hot weather, stock left over must be boiled each day,
and poured into a clean basin to prevent its turning sour. In warm
weather, soups with milk in their composition should have a pinch of
baking soda added.

Thickenings for soup consist usually of yolks of eggs and cream beaten
together in a basin, the boiling soup poured on slowly, stirring well
at the same time. Soups thus thickened should not be allowed to
boil again, otherwise they will curdle. Instead of eggs and cream,
cornstarch and milk may be used to thicken the soup.



Asparagus Soup

  40 heads asparagus
  3 tablespoonfuls flour
  3 tablespoonfuls Crisco
  1/2 cupful cream
  1 quart white stock

onion, put these into saucepan with Crisco, herbs, parsley, bay leaf,
and mace, and fry gently for fifteen minutes, add flour, then stock,
and simmer slowly for 1-1/2 hours. Rub through sieve, add cream, yolks
of eggs, and seasonings, reheat, but take care not to boil soup. Just
before serving throw in asparagus tops, which should be first cooked
in a little boiling stock.



Cheese Soup

  4 tablespoonfuls grated cheese
  3 quarts clear soup stock
  1-1/2 cupfuls flour
  4 tablespoonfuls Crisco

Put flour into double boiler, add gradually cream, Crisco, 4
tablespoonfuls of grated cheese and paprika to taste, stir over fire
till a smooth paste. Break in eggs, mix well, cook two minutes longer
and allow to cool. Roll into balls, when they are all formed, drop
into boiling water and cook gently five minutes. Drain and put into
soup tureen. Pour over boiling stock and serve with dish of finely
grated cheese.



Cream of Tomato Soup

  2 tablespoonfuls flour
  1-1/2 tablespoonfuls Crisco
  1 cupful milk
  2-1/2 cupfuls strained tomato juice
  1 teaspoonful celery salt
  Salt, pepper, and paprika to taste
  Pinch baking soda
  1 tablespoonful tomato catsup

Blend Crisco and flour together in saucepan over fire, add milk and
bring to boiling point. Heat tomato juice, tomato catsup and add soda
and seasonings. Just before serving add Crisco mixture to tomato juice
and stir till boiling. Serve hot. Another method, is to cook 1 quart
can of tomatoes with 1 quart of water twenty minutes, then rub through
sieve. Blend 2 tablespoonfuls Crisco with 2 tablespoonfuls flour, add
1 tablespoonful sugar, salt, pepper, and red pepper to taste, and 1
tablespoonful tomato catsup. Add pinch of baking soda to tomatoes,
then add gradually to Crisco mixture. Just bring to boiling point and
serve with tablespoonful whipped cream on top of each plate.



Fish Soup

  1 lb. cod, or other white fish
  2 tablespoonfuls Crisco
  1 quart white stock, or half milk and half water
  1 small carrot
  1 small onion
  1 stalk celery
  3 parsley sprigs
  1 blade mace
  2 egg yolks
  1/2 cupful cream
  1 lemon
  2 tablespoonfuls flour
  1 teaspoonful chopped parsley

  Dry toast

Wash and dry fish and cut into small pieces. Put into saucepan with
stock, vegetables cut in small pieces, parsley and mace. Let these
simmer for half hour, then strain off liquid. Melt Crisco in pan, stir
in flour, then add fish liquor and stir till it boils. Draw it to the
side of fire and let cool slightly. Beat yolks of eggs with cream,
and, when soup has cooled, strain them in. Reheat soup without boiling
it, to cook eggs. Season, and add few drops lemon juice and chopped
parsley. Serve with small pieces of dry toast.



Lentil Soup

  1 cupful lentils
  2 cupfuls milk
  3 tablespoonfuls Crisco
  3 pints stock or water
  1 onion
  1 carrot
  2 stalks celery
  1 tablespoonful flour
  1 bay leaf
  Salt and pepper to taste
  1/4 cupful cream
  Croutons

Wash lentils; soak twenty-four hours; drain well. Cut onion, carrot
and celery into small pieces, then put them into a saucepan with
Crisco, cover, and cook gently for fifteen minutes. Add stock and
simmer 2 hours, then rub through sieve. Return to pan, add milk,
seasonings, and bring to boil. Moisten flour with 1/2 cupful milk or
stock, add it to soup and simmer five minutes. Season to taste and add
cream. Serve with croutons of fried or toasted bread.

Lentils are a small leguminous seed, not so generally known as beans,
but an excellent nitrogenous food, containing about 25 per cent.
protein, more than 50 per cent. starch, with over 2 per cent. fat.
They are not used as much as they ought to be.

Croutons are made by cutting bread into tiny cubes and browning
through and through in hot oven or putting into a frying pan with 2
tablespoonfuls Crisco and browning well. If latter is used great care
must be used as the croutons will brown easily.



Lobster Bisque

  1 can lobster
  1 cupful breadcrumbs
  1 quart milk
  1 quart water
  1 tablespoonful flour
  1/4 cupful Crisco
  Salt, pepper, red pepper, and grated nutmeg to taste
  Squares fried bread
  Thin lemon slices

Open a can of lobster of good quality, take out best pieces and cut
into small squares without tearing; put them aside. Place remains of
lobster in mortar or basin, and pound quite smooth with Crisco. Soak
bread in water, adding flour, and seasonings, and put all on fire in
soup pot with pounded lobster and Crisco; stir till it boils, and boil
for fifteen minutes; then pass it through sieve, add milk and pieces
of lobster, and return to the pot till it boils up. Serve with small
squares of fried bread, and send thin slices of lemon to table with
it. This is an excellent soup, and can of course be made with fresh
lobster.



Norfolk Puree

  1/2 cupful barley, pearl
  1 quart water
  3 pints white stock
  1/2 cupful cream
  1 yolk of egg
  2 tablespoonfuls Crisco
  4 tablespoonfuls cooked carrot balls
  4 tablespoonfuls cooked peas
  Salt, pepper, and paprika to taste
  Diced toast or fried bread

Put barley into saucepan of cold water, bring to boil, let boil five
minutes, then drain off water; this removes the slightly bitter taste.
Now put barley into saucepan with Crisco and water, let these boil
gently until barley is tender, drain, and rub through sieve. Add stock
to this puree and let simmer ten minutes. Beat yolk of egg with cream
and when soup has cooled slightly, strain them in. Stir soup over fire
a few minutes to reheat; but be careful that it does not boil, or it
will curdle. Season carefully, add carrot balls and peas, which should
first be heated in a little stock or water. Serve with dice of toast
or fried bread. If you do not possess a round vegetable cutter, cut
the carrot into small dice. This is a particularly nourishing soup. If
you prefer a slightly cheaper variety, use milk instead of cream, and
if you have no white stock use milk and water in equal proportions
instead, and cook a carrot, turnip and onion in milk and water for
twenty or thirty minutes.



Soup Verte

  4 tablespoonfuls flour
  3 tablespoonfuls Crisco
  2 quarts stock
  1 bunch parsley

thoroughly washed; let all boil twenty minutes; strain, rubbing puree
through sieve. Return it all to saucepan, add Crisco and flour mixed
together with cupful of water, sugar and strained juice of a quarter
of lemon. Let boil five minutes. Beat yolks of eggs with 1/4 cupful
water, add them gradually to soup off fire, and stir near fire until
cooked. Soup must not boil after yolks are added. Season with salt and
pepper and serve.



Thick Rice Soup

  2 pints water or stock
  Salt and pepper to taste
  2 small onions
  2 tablespoonfuls Crisco
  1 cupful rice
  1 cupful canned tomatoes, or 4 fresh ones

Wash and drain rice. Heat Crisco in saucepan, add rice and stir
constantly until a golden brown. Now add water or stock, onions and
tomatoes cut in small pieces, and seasonings. Cook slowly for one
hour.

FISH


Fish, though not quite so nutritious or so stimulating as butcher's
meat, is an excellent article of diet, as it is light and easy of
digestion and well suited to delicate persons and those following
sedentary occupations, who generally do not take exercise in the fresh
air. Fish contains a fair proportion of flesh forming and mineral
matter, and the white kinds very little fat, hence their value in a
sick diet. A few fishes are rich in fat, as salmon, mackerel, eels,
and herrings; they are more satisfying as a meal, but usually more
difficult to digest, except the latter, which is fairly easy to
digest, and, being inexpensive, forms an economical food.

The digestibility will vary also with the quality of the fish and the
methods of cooking. White fish when boiled is improved by being rubbed
over with a cut lemon, or by adding a little vinegar to the water in
which it is cooked to keep it white and firm. The fish should be
put into hot, not boiling water, otherwise the higher temperature
contracts the skin too quickly, and it breaks and looks unsightly.
Salt fish may be placed in cold water, then boiled to extract some of
the salt; if the fish has been salted and dried, it is better to soak
it in cold water for about twelve hours before cooking.

Fish to be fried should be cooked in sufficient hot Crisco to well
cover it, after having been dried and covered with batter, or with
beaten egg and breadcrumbs. To egg and breadcrumb fish put a slice
into seasoned flour, turning it so that both sides may be covered.
Shake off all loose flour. Brush fish over with beaten egg. Raise fish
out of egg with the brush and a knife, drain off egg for a second, and
lay fish in crumbs. Toss these all over it, lift out fish, shake off
all loose crumbs, lay the slice on a board, and press crumbs down, so
that surface is flat. The thicker the fish the more slowly it must be
fried after the first two minutes, or it will be raw inside when the
outside is done.

[Illustration]

_To bone fish._ The process of boning is known as filleting and is
generally done by the fish dealer, but when this is not the case the
single rule for boning must be strictly adhered to in order to keep
the knife on the bone lifting the flesh with the left hand while the
knife slips in between the bone and the flesh. Flat fish are divided
down the middle of each side well into the bone, and the boning is
begun at either side of the incision. Round fish are cut down the
back, the flesh is laid open from one side and the bone is removed
from the other. Occasionally round fish are boned readily, the
whole fish minus the bones being returned to its proper shape, as in
anchovies, sardines, herrings, haddocks, etc., in this case the fish
would be split down the front, not the back, and stitched together
after boning.

Fish stock is made from the bones, skin and trimmings of white fish.
These are broken small and generally flavored with onion, parsley,
herbs, and seasonings. The proportion of water used is rather larger,
as the flavor is much stronger and also more easily extracted than
from meat.



Baked Halibut

_For fish._ Mix Crisco with shallot, gherkin, anchovy, and seasonings,
lay salmon in this mixture and let it "marinade," as it is called, for
one hour. At the end of that time lift it out; do not shake off any
ingredients that are sticking to it. Now lay it in a well Criscoed
fireproof dish, cover it with a greased paper, and bake in moderate
oven for thirty minutes.

_For sauce._ Melt Crisco in small saucepan, stir in flour, add fish
stock and stir until it boils and thickens. Rub anchovies through fine
sieve, and add with seasonings. Serve in hot tureen with fish.



Baked Shad

  1 shad weighing 4 lbs.
  1/4 lb. mushrooms
  1/2 cupful Crisco
  2 tablespoonfuls chopped parsley
  2 tablespoonfuls chopped chives
  1 cupful breadcrumbs
  1 egg
  Salt and white pepper
  Salt pork
  1 cupful cream
  1 teaspoonful cornstarch

Clean, wipe and dry the shad. Melt Crisco, add breadcrumbs, chopped
mushrooms, parsley, chives, egg well beaten, salt and pepper. Stuff
fish with this forcemeat, then lay it in a greased pan, put thin
strips of salt pork over it and bake in hot oven for forty minutes.
Lay the fish on a hot platter. Pour cream into baking pan, add
cornstarch and stir till boiling. Serve with the fish.



Cassolettes of Fish

  1/2 lb. cold cooked fish or shrimps
  1/2 cupful milk
  4 tablespoonfuls Crisco
  1/2 cupful water
  2 tablespoonfuls cream 2 eggs
  4 tablespoonfuls flour
  Salt, pepper, and red pepper to taste
  1 teaspoonful lemon juice
  2 lbs. cooked potatoes

Rub potatoes through a sieve, add little salt and pepper, 1 egg well
beaten, and 2 tablespoonfuls melted Crisco and mix well. Roll out
on floured baking board to 1-1/4 inches in thickness. Cut into small
rounds, brush over with remaining egg well beaten, toss in fine
breadcrumbs, mark the center slightly with a smaller round cutter. Fry
to golden color in hot Crisco. Remove lids, carefully remove bulk of
potatoes from inside, fill with mixture, replace lids, and serve hot.
For mixture, blend 2 tablespoonfuls of the Crisco with flour in a
saucepan over the fire, add milk, water and seasonings and cook for
a few minutes. Put in flaked fish and make hot. Add cream last. 1/2
teaspoonful of anchovy extract may be added if liked.

Sufficient for ten cassolettes.



Dressed Crab

  1 good sized heavy crab
  6 tablespoonfuls Crisco
  2 tablespoonfuls breadcrumbs
  3 tablespoonfuls olive oil
  2 tablespoonfuls vinegar
  1 tablespoonful chopped parsley
  Crisp lettuce leaves
  Salt and pepper to taste

If possible choose a crab with large claws. Boil crab in boiling
salted water for thirty minutes, take up and break off large and small
claws. Lay crab on its back, pull back the flap under its body, pull
it right out and commence to remove flesh from shell. Take care that
the little bag near head, usually full of sand, is taken out. Throw
away all bone and finny pieces. The flesh is of two kinds, some firm
and white, rest soft and dark. Separate former into little shreds with
a fork, also the white meat from claws, which must be cracked in order
to obtain it. Mix dark soft substance with crumbs, add oil, vinegar,
and seasonings to taste. Toss shredded white meat also in a little
seasoning, but keep the two kinds separate. When shell is empty
wash and dry well. Fill shell with the two mixtures, arranging them
alternately, so that they appear in dark and white stripes. Have it
heaped a little higher in center. Decorate meat with lines of finely
chopped parsley, and force the Crisco round edge with a forcing bag
and tube. Place crab on some crisp lettuce leaves. Arrange some of the
small claws in a circle round shell.



Curried Cod

  1 tablespoonful lemon juice
  Salt, pepper, and red pepper to taste
  2 cupfuls plain boiled rice
  2 tablespoonfuls chopped cocoanut

Wash and dry the cod, and cut into pieces two inches square. Melt
Crisco in a saucepan, fry cod lightly in it, then take out and set
aside. Add sliced onion, flour, and curry powder to the Crisco in
saucepan and fry ten minutes, stirring continuously to prevent onion
becoming too brown, then stir in the stock and cocoanut, stir until it
boils, and afterwards simmer for twenty minutes. Strain and return
to saucepan, add lemon juice and seasonings to taste, bring nearly to
boil, then put in fish, cover closely, and cook slowly for half hour.
An occasional stir must be given to prevent the fish sticking to the
bottom of the saucepan. Turn out on hot platter and serve with rice.
The remains of cold fish may be used, in which case the preliminary
frying may be omitted.



Flounder a la Creme

  1 flounder about 2 lbs.

Skin flounder, and take fillets off neatly by sharply cutting down the
middle of back, and pressing the knife close to the bones. This will
produce 4 long fillets. Cut each of them in half lengthways, and tie
up in pretty knot; sprinkle a little salt over and put them aside.
Wash skin bones of fish, put them into a small saucepan with milk,
mace, and whole peppers and simmer for half hour; strain milk into
clean saucepan; add fillets, and allow to simmer for ten minutes. Lift
them out, and add to milk the Crisco and flour beaten together; stir
till it becomes quite smooth; add salt, pepper and lemon juice to
taste, and cream; put in fillets gently to warm through; dish neatly
and pour the sauce over them. Serve very hot.

MEATS

Cookery is a branch of applied chemistry. To cook anything, in the
narrower sense of the term, means to bring about changes in it by
submitting it to the action of heat, and usually of moisture also,
which will make it more fitted for food; and it is on the nature of
this action on different materials that the _rationale_ of the cook's
art chiefly depends. Good cooking can make any meat tender, and bad
cooking can make any meat tough.

The substance in meat called albumen becomes tougher and more
indigestible, the higher the temperature to which it is subjected
reaches beyond a certain point. It is this effect of heat on albumen,
therefore, which has to be considered whenever the cooking of meat
is in question, and which mainly determines the right and the wrong,
whether in the making of a soup or a custard, the roasting or boiling
of a chicken or a joint, or the frying of a cutlet or an omelet.

We now will see to begin with, what are the special ways in which it
bears on meat cookery. Take a little bit of raw meat and put it in
cold water. The juice gradually soaks out of it, coloring the water
pink and leaving the meat nearly white. Now take another bit, and pour
boiling water upon it; and though no juice can be seen escaping, the
whole surface of the meat turns a whitish color directly.

Lean meat is made up of bundles of hollow fibres within which the
albuminous juices are stored. Wherever these fibres are cut through,
the juice oozes out and spreads itself over the surface of the meat.
If, as in our first little experiment, the meat is put in cold water,
or even in warm water, or exposed to a heat insufficient to set the
albumen, either in an oven or before the fire, the albuminous juices
are in the first case drawn out and dissolved, and in the second
evaporated. In either case the meat is deprived of them. But if the
meat is put into boiling water or into a quick oven or before a hot
fire, the surface albumen is quickly set, forms a tough white coating
which effectually plugs the ends of the cut fibres, and prevents any
further escape of their contents.

Here, then, we have the first principles on which meat cookery must be
conducted; viz: that if we wish to get the juices out of the meat,
as for soups and stews, the liquid in which we put it must be cold
to begin with; while if we wish, as for boiled or roast meat, to keep
them in, the meat must be subjected first of all to the action of
boiling water, a hot fire or a quick oven. The meats of soups and
stews must not be raw, and that of joints must not be tough; and the
cooking of both one and the other, however it is begun, should be
completed at just such a moderate temperature as will set, but not
harden, the albumen. That is to say, the soup or stew must be raised
to this temperature, after the meat juices have been drawn out by
a lower one, while a joint or fowl must be lowered to it after the
surface albumen has been hardened by a higher one.

All poultry or game for roasting should be dredged with flour before
and after trussing, to dry it perfectly, as otherwise it does not
crisp and brown so well. Unless poultry is to be boiled or stewed it
never should be washed or wet in any way as this renders the flesh
sodden and the skin soft. Good wiping with clean cloths should be
quite sufficient. With the exception of ducks and geese, all poultry
and game require rather a large addition of fat during roasting, as
the flesh is dry. Chickens will cook in from twenty to thirty minutes;
fowls take from thirty to sixty minutes when young and tender, the
only condition in which they are fit to roast; turkeys take from one
to two hours and even more if exceptionally large. Game takes longer
in proportion to its size than poultry, and all birds require better
and more cooking than beef or mutton.

Fried Sweetbreads

  Sweetbreads
  Egg
  Breadcrumbs
  Crisco
  Peas or new Potatoes
  Rich brown gravy

Sweetbreads should always be blanched before using. To blanch, soak in
cold water two hours, changing water 3 or 4 times. Put into saucepan,
cover with cold water, add little salt, and skim well as water comes
to boil. Simmer from ten to thirty minutes, according to kind of
sweet-bread used. Remove to basin of cold water until cold, or wash
well in cold water and press between two plates till cold. Dry, remove
skin, cut in slices, coat with beaten egg and toss in breadcrumbs, and
fry in hot Crisco to a golden brown. Serve round peas or new potatoes,
with rich brown gravy.

For those whose digestions are at fault, sweetbreads ought to be eaten
as a daily ration if the pocketbook will afford it. For this special
part of the animal's anatomy is that one of all the viscera whose
mission is to help digestion. It is of the very pancreas itself, that
stomach gland of marvelously involved structure which elaborates the
powerful pancreatic juice. It is alkaline in nature, able to digest
starches, fats, and most of what escapes digestion in the stomach
proper. It received its name from a fancied resemblance in its
substance and formation to the rising lumps of dough destined for
bread.

VEGETABLES

[Illustration]


In the vegetable kingdom the cereals form a very important part of our
diet, by supplying chiefly the carbohydrates or heat giving matter.
Another nutritious group termed pulse, are those which have their seed
enclosed in a pod. The most familiar are peas, beans, and lentils;
peas and beans are eaten in the green or unripe state as well as in
the dried. Vegetables included in the pulse group are very nourishing
if they can be digested, they contain a large amount of flesh forming
matter, usually a fair amount of starch, but are deficient in fat.
Peas and beans also contain sulphur and tend to produce flatulence
when indulged in by those of weak digestion. Lentils contain less
sulphur, and do not produce this complaint so readily.

The more succulent vegetables include tubers, as potatoes and
Jerusalem artichokes, leaves, stems, and bulbs, as cabbages, spinach,
celery, and onions, roots and flowers, as carrots, parsnips, and
cauliflower. These are very valuable on account of the mineral matter,
chief of which are the potash salts, so necessary to keep the blood in
a healthy condition.

Care should be taken in cooking vegetables not to lose the salts.
Steaming is preferable to boiling, by preserving the juices, though it
does not tend to improve the color of green vegetables. A little lemon
juice added to the water in which new potatoes are boiling improves
their color. Mint is sometimes cooked with new potatoes. To secure a
good color in vegetables when cooked, careful cleaning and preparation
before cooking is essential. Earthy roots, such as potatoes, turnips,
and carrots, must be both well scrubbed and thoroughly rinsed in clean
water before peeling. From all vegetables, coarse or discolored leaves
and any dark or decayed spots should be carefully removed before
cooking.

Potatoes should be peeled thinly, or, if new, merely brushed or rubbed
with a coarse cloth to get the skin off. Turnips should be thickly
peeled, as the rind in these is hard and woody. Carrots and salsify,
unless very old, need scraping only. After the removal of the skin,
all root vegetables (except those of the onion kind) should be put in
cold water till wanted. Potatoes, artichokes, and salsify especially,
must not remain a moment out of water after peeling, or they will turn
a dark color, and to the water used for the two last, a little salt
and lemon juice should be added in order to keep them white.

Root vegetables should be boiled with the lid of the pan on, green
vegetables should be boiled with the lid of the pan off, for the
preservation of the color.

SALADS

[Illustration]


Salads are classified into two groups--i.e., the raw, such as lettuce,
endive, radishes, cucumber, celery, etc., and the cooked, such as
those made from cooked vegetables, eggs, cooked cold fish, poultry,
and meat. The raw materials should be washed most carefully and well
cleaned before mixing, and the utensils for cutting and mixing, as
well as the basins or bowls used, should be clean and dry. Every
salad, no matter how plain and simple it may be, should be made to
look inviting and tempting. The method of draining or drying is a very
easy performance so long as the salad leaves, whatever they may be,
are almost free from moisture. This is effected best by putting the
leaves, which should be broken, not cut with a knife, into a wire
basket and drying them well, or else putting them into a cloth lightly
folded and shaking well until the outer moisture of the leaves is well
absorbed. The salad then is ready for mixing.

Any cold boiled vegetables left over from dinner are useful as giving
variety to salads, and help to make a good accompaniment to cold meat
served to luncheon. Thinly sliced cold potatoes--new ones for choice,
green peas and string beans, are especially good for this purpose, and
even Brussels sprouts, carrots, and turnips may be used on occasion in
small quantities. More substantial salads, prepared with cold meat or
fish, form appetizing luncheon or breakfast dishes. Those made with
chicken, lobster and salmon respectively are most widely known, but
fillets of flounder, cold ham or beef, or lamb make very good salads,
and even the humble herring, and dried and salted fish, may be used
with advantage in this way.

The meat or fish should be cut up into cubes or convenient small
pieces, and piled up in the center of the dish or salad bowl on a
layer of seasoned, shredded lettuce. Over this should be poured half
of the dressing. Round this should be arranged the green constituents
of the salad, cut up rather small, garnished with slices of tomato
or beets, cucumber and hard-cooked egg. The remainder of the dressing
should be poured over this, and the top of the meat or fish pyramid
may be ornamented with a few sprigs of endive or parsley.

PUDDINGS

[Illustration]


Puddings as a rule either are boiled, steamed or baked. For boiled
puddings, care should be taken that the saucepan be kept boiling or
the water will get into the pudding and spoil it. For pudding cloths,
use materials such as linen or cheese cloth. After using, the cloth
must be thoroughly washed in plenty of water with a little washing
soda, but on no account use soap, and see that the cloth is perfectly
dry before putting it away. Many puddings are lighter and better
steamed, and then instead of the cloth only a piece of Criscoed paper
is required, twisted over the top of the basin or mold. Very light
puddings, such as custards, should be placed in a steamer. Most of
the steamed puddings mixed a little softer, are excellent baked in a
pudding dish.

In steaming puddings keep them at a uniform heat all the time, and be
careful not to lift the lid off the pan for the first half hour. All
farinaceous puddings should be cooked well, as then they are easier
to digest. Cornstarch must be well cooked, from eight to ten minutes.
Mold for jellies or blanc-manges should be well rinsed with cold water
before using. Batters must be well beaten and allowed to stand for
thirty minutes or longer before cooking, because the starch in
the flour swells, and the batter will therefore be lighter.
Batter puddings should be put into a quick oven. Puddings composed
principally of milk and eggs should be very gently cooked, as strong
heat will cause them to curdle.

In stewing fruit, prepare syrup first. Bring to boil, lay fruit in,
and simmer gently. Souffles should be very light and spongy. Eggs
form a large part of souffles, more whites than yolks are used and
the former are beaten to a stiff froth. All souffles should be served
quickly. Omelets are composed mainly of eggs. They can be savory or
sweet. If over-cooked an omelet will be tough. To prevent milk running
over when it comes to boil, put spoon in saucepan. Never leave spoon
in saucepan if you wish the contents to cook quickly, and in any case
a metal spoon never should be allowed to stand in a boiling saucepan
containing fruit or any acid.

SANDWICHES

[Illustration]


If the slices of bread have to be spread with butter or with a paste
it should be done before they are cut off. The slices should not be
cut thicker than an eighth of an inch. When butter is used there must
just be enough of it for us to know in some mysterious fashion that
it is there. Every scrap of a sandwich should be eatable. Sandwiches
usually are served on folded napkins, and arranged in circles, so
that one overlaps the other. It is well to lay a damp napkin over the
sandwiches, if they are not wanted immediately, in order to keep them
moist. To make superior sandwich butter, work one cupful of butter
in a basin with a clean and dry wooden spoon until soft; then add by
degrees half a cupful of whipped cream, seasoning of salt and mustard,
and put it in a cool place until required.

PASTRIES

[Illustration]


There are two principal divisions, within which all varieties may be
included, viz:

1. Short or plain pastries.

2. Flaky pastries.

Of these, the former includes all pastes in which the fat is mixed
evenly with the dough throughout; the latter, those in which, by one
means or another, the two are arranged in alternate layers. The short
pastes are the simplest, and for this reason should be experimented on
to begin with. With pastry, a good deal always depends on the mixing.
The best way is to measure out the average quantity of liquid, to pour
about three-quarters of this gradually into the flour, at the same
time stirring this briskly with a knife, so as to get it evenly
moistened, and then add, in very small quantities at a time, as much
more water as may be needed. To see, in this way, when the flour has
been moistened enough, is easy. By the time the first three parts of
water have been put in, most of it will have stuck together in little
separate rolls; if on pressing these they should not only cling
together, but readily collect about them whatever loose flour there
may be, sufficient moisture will have been added; but so long as the
mixture, when pressed, remains to some degree crumbly, it is a sign
that a little more water is required. When done, the paste should
stick together, but should not adhere either to the hands or to the
basin. If it does this it is too wet, and more flour must be dusted
over it and kneaded in till the surplus moisture has been absorbed. A
sure sign of its having been mixed properly is when it can be rolled
into a lump, and the basin wiped out cleanly with it, as with a cloth.
To roll out, flour the pastry board slightly, lay the dough on it, and
form it into a neat, flat oblong shape.

[Illustration]

Press it out first a little with the roller, and then roll with
short, quick strokes to the thickness required. Always roll straight
forwards, neither sideways nor obliquely. If the paste wants widening,
alter its position, not the direction of the rolling. At the beginning
of each stroke, bring the roller rather sharply down, so as to drive
out the paste in front of it, and take especial care in rolling to
stop always just short of the edges. Short pastry differs from the
flaky pastries in requiring but one rolling out.

It should be handled and rolled as little as possible and when
carefully made it should not be in the least leathery or tough. Air in
this method is mixed equally throughout the paste, and when it expands
in the oven raises the paste in all directions. The flakiness of
pastry depends upon the kind and amount of shortening used. Crisco
makes tenderer crust than either lard or butter. Make pastry in a
cool atmosphere and on a cool surface. The lightness of pastry depends
largely upon the light handling in blending the Crisco with the flour
and in the rolling of the pastry upon the board. The best results are
obtained by cutting the Crisco into the flour with a knife.

If pastry contains baking powder it should be put into the oven as
quickly as possible, but if it contains a liberal supply of Crisco
without baking powder, it improves by being set aside in a cool place
a few hours. Pastry that is light, dry and flaky, is separated more
easily by the gastric fluids than that which is heavy. The flour must
be of good quality, fine and dry. All pastry requires to be placed
in a hot oven, slightly hotter for flaky than short crust. The oven
should register from 310 deg. F. to 340 deg. F. The great heat quickly will
cause the starch grains to burst and absorb the fat, otherwise the
pastry will be heavy.

In making flaky pastry, if it has been rolled and folded properly,
and not allowed to stick to the board, nor cut so that air can pass
through layers, this air when heated in the oven expands and raises
the paste in layers or puffs. Heat of oven must be great enough to fix
the pastry in this raised condition, and as cold air prevents this,
the oven door must not be opened too soon, or any more than necessary.
See that the oven is clean.



Plain Crisco Pastry

  1-1/2 cupfuls flour
  1/2 cupful Crisco
  1/2 teaspoonful salt
  Cold water

Sift flour and salt and cut Crisco into flour with knife until finely
divided. Finger tips may be used to finish blending materials. Add
gradually sufficient water to make stiff paste. Water should be added
sparingly and mixed with knife through dry ingredients. Form lightly
and quickly with hand into dough; roll out on slightly floured
board, about one-quarter inch thick. Use light motion in handling
rolling-pin, and roll from center outward.

Sufficient for one small pie.



The New Crisco Pastry

  2 cupfuls flour
  3/4 cupful Crisco
  1 egg
  1 tablespoonful lemon juice
  Sufficient cold water to hold mixture together
  3/4 teaspoonful salt

Sift flour and salt into basin. Flour blade of knife, and chop Crisco
into flour, being careful to keep flour between blade of knife and
shortening. When mixture looks like meal, add gradually, egg well
beaten and mixed with lemon juice. Roll pastry into ball with knife.
May be used at once, but will be improved if allowed to stand in cool
place for one hour. Should be rolled out once and handled as lightly
as possible. May be used for sweet or savory dishes. Bake in hot oven.
The purpose of the addition of lemon is to render gluten of flour more
ductile, so that it will stretch rather than break as paste is rolled
out, or as it rises in oven.

Sufficient for two pies.



Tip Top Pastry

  1/2 teaspoonful salt
  1-1/2 teaspoonfuls baking powder
  2-1/4 cupfuls flour
  1/2 cupful Crisco
  Cold water
  1 teaspoonful lemon juice

Sift and mix together flour, salt, and baking powder. Rub in Crisco
with finger tips. Chill two hours. Then take out 1/2 cupful, and
to remainder add lemon juice and cold water gradually to make stiff
paste. Knead lightly and roll into long narrow strip. Sprinkle dough
with half of reserved mixture and fold so as to make 3 layers. Turn
half way round, roll again into strip, sprinkle with rest of mixture
and fold as before. Roll and fold twice more, and pastry is ready for
use for cakes, puddings, or pies.

Sufficient for two pies.



Cornstarch Pastry

  1-1/4 cupfuls cornstarch
  1-1/4 cupfuls flour
  2 tablespoonfuls sugar
  1/2 cupful Crisco
  1/2 teaspoonful salt
  1 teaspoonful baking powder
  1 yolk of egg
  Milk to mix

Rub Crisco lightly into cornstarch and flour, add salt, sugar, baking
powder, beaten yolk of egg, and sufficient milk to mix to stiff paste.
Roll out lightly and use for tartlets or one crust pie.

Sufficient for two large pies.



Double Pie

  Top Layer

  1 cupful sugar
  1 cupful sweet milk
  2 eggs
  2 cupfuls flour
  1/2 cupful Crisco
  2 teaspoonfuls baking powder
  1/2 teaspoonful salt


  Under Layer

  1 cupful molasses
  1 cupful brown sugar
  1 pint hot water
  Plain Crisco Pastry
  1 lemon
  1 egg
  2 tablespoonfuls flour

Line large pie plate with pastry.

_For under layer._ Mix sugar with flour, add molasses, egg well
beaten, grated lemon rind, and hot water, and pour into prepared pie
plate.

_For top layer._ Cream Crisco and sugar together, add eggs well
beaten, milk, salt, flour, and baking powder. Spread mixture over
under layer and bake in hot oven thirty-five minutes.

Sufficient for two large pies.



Almond Layer Pie

  For Pastry

  2 cupfuls flour
  7 tablespoonfuls Crisco
  1/2 teaspoonful salt
  Water


  For Filling

  6 tablespoonfuls Crisco
  3/4 cupful sugar
  1 lemon
  3 eggs
  1/2 cupful blanched powdered almonds
  1/4 teaspoonful salt

Make short crust of Crisco, flour, salt, and water. Roll out thin, and
line Criscoed pie plate with piece of paste.

_For filling._ Cream Crisco and sugar together, add eggs well beaten,
almonds, salt, grated rind and one tablespoonful lemon juice. Mix well
and spread one-half of mixture on to pastry. Then cover with a layer
of pastry, the rest of mixture, and lastly cover with pastry. Bake in
a moderate oven until brown. Or the pastry may be rolled out, brushed
over with melted Crisco, the mixture spread over it, and rolled up
to form a roly-poly. Lay on a Criscoed tin and bake in moderate oven
until brown.

Sufficient for one large pie.



Flake Pastry No. 1

  2 cupfuls flour
  8 tablespoonfuls Crisco
  3/4 teaspoonful salt
  Just enough cold water to hold dough together

Sift flour and salt and cut half the Crisco into flour with knife
until it is finely divided. The finger tips may be used to finish
blending materials. Then add water sparingly, mixing it with knife
through dry materials. Form with the hand into dough and roll out on a
floured board to quarter inch thickness. Spread one-third of remaining
Crisco on two-thirds of dough nearest you; fold twice, to make three
layers, folding in first that part on which Crisco has not been
spread. Turn dough, putting folded edges to the sides; roll out,
spread and fold as before. Repeat once more. Use a light motion in
handling rolling-pin, and roll from center outward. Should Crisco be
too hard, it will not mix readily with flour, in which case the result
will be a tough crust.

Sufficient for two covered pies.



Flake Pastry No. 2

  1/2 teaspoonful salt
  2 cupfuls flour
  1/2 cupful Crisco
  Cold water

Mix salt with flour; divide Crisco into four equal parts, rub in one
of these only, and then mix to stiff paste with a little cold water.
Shape into neat oblong piece, and roll into straight strip about three
times as long as it is broad. All over this put on, with the point of
knife, one of remaining quarters of Crisco, distributing it evenly in
little dabs about size of a pea, so that they look like buttons on
a card. Now flour surface lightly and fold paste exactly in three by
taking hold of the two bottom corners and doubling them upwards from
you and then of the top corners and doubling them downwards towards
you. Turn now at right angles to its former position so as to have
open ends pointing towards you. Press these quickly together with
the roller to inclose some air, and press paste across also in two or
three places, making little ridges, thus preventing air which has been
shut in, from forming into large bubble. Roll out again, and repeat
till remaining two parts of Crisco have thus been used. At the last
rolling, bring to required thickness; and if it needs widening as well
as lengthening, turn it at right angles to its former position, and
roll straight across it as before, a rule which, with flaky pastry,
should always be observed, since, unlike the short pastries, its
lightness suffers if rolled obliquely to the direction in which it has
been folded.

Sufficient for two small pies.



Puff Pastry

  1 teaspoonful salt
  1 cupful Crisco
  2 cupfuls flour
  1 yolk of egg
  2 teaspoonfuls lemon juice
  Cold water

Measure Crisco and set in cold place to chill it. Sift flour and salt
into basin, and add lemon juice. Take a quarter of the Crisco, and rub
it lightly into flour with finger tips until there are no lumps left.
Beat yolk of egg and add a little cold water, then add them to the
flour, making them into a stiffish dough. Turn this on to floured
board, and work well with hands until it will no longer stick to
fingers and forms a perfectly smooth dough. Form into oblong piece and
roll out to about half inch thickness. The Crisco to be used should be
as nearly, as possible of same consistency as the paste.

Form it into neat flat cake, and place in center of pastry. Fold
up rather loosely, and flat the folds with rolling-pin. Place in
refrigerator for ten minutes. Then roll out pastry into long narrow
strip, being careful that Crisco does not get through. Fold exactly
in three, press down folds, and lay aside in cool place or in
refrigerator fifteen minutes. This is called giving the pastry one
"turn" and seven of these is the number required for this pastry. The
next time the pastry is rolled, place it with the joins at your right
hand side, and open end's towards you. Give two "turns" this time,
and again set aside in cool place for at least fifteen minutes.
Repeat this until pastry has had seven rolls in all. The object of the
cooling between the rolls is to keep Crisco and flour in distinct and
separate layers, in which it is the function of the rolling-pin and
folding to arrange them, and on which the lightness of the pastry
depends.

When rolling, keep the pressure of the two hands as equal as possible.
If the pastry becomes rounded, it shows that there is more pressure
being done on the rounded side than the other. After it has received
its last roll, it is better to be laid aside before using, then rolled
to the thickness required.

Sufficient for two pies.



Rough Puff Pastry

  Cold water

Have Crisco cold and firm. Sift flour and salt into basin, add Crisco
and cut into pieces one inch square. Beat up egg, add lemon juice
and a very little cold water, then add them gradually into other
ingredients making them into a stiff paste. Roll in a long piece on
floured board, fold in three, turn rough edges toward you and roll
out again, continuing this for five times. Place in refrigerator or in
cool place ten minutes between each rolling. This pastry may be used
at once for all kinds of sweet or savory pies, but it is improved by
standing for a few hours in a cool place. Bake in hot oven. Sufficient
for two covered pies.

BREADS &c.

[Illustration]


The usual method of making bread is to ferment dough with yeast;
the latter acts upon certain constituents in the flour ultimately
producing a gas which permeates the dough. The dough is placed in a
very hot oven, the heat kills the yeast plant, the gas expands with
the heat, still raising the dough. The loaf is set in shape, and, when
finally cooked and the gas all escaped, will be found to be light and
full of tiny holes. Certain factors hasten or delay these changes. A
moist, warm medium being most favorable to the growth of the yeast,
the water should just be lukewarm; then a good flour, containing
about 8 per cent of gluten is necessary. This gluten is the proteid in
flour; when well mixed with water it forms a viscid elastic substance,
hence it is necessary to well knead dough to make it more springy, so
that when the gas is generated in it, it will expand and take the form
of a sponge, and thus prevent the gas from escaping. The bread must be
put into a very hot oven at first, 340 deg. F., so that the yeast plant is
killed quickly. If this be not accomplished soon, the loaf may go on
spreading in the oven, and, if not sour in taste, will not be of such
a good flavor.

Plenty of salt in dough is said to strengthen the gluten, give a
good flavor to the bread, and keep it moist for a longer time, but it
rather retards the working of the yeast. Flour also may be made into
a light loaf by using baking powder to produce the gas. This is a much
quicker process, but the bread is not liked so universally as when
made with yeast. For, when yeast is used, other changes take place in
the dough besides the production of the gas, that seem to give bread
the characteristic flavor constantly welcome by the palate. Good flour
has a slight pure smell, free from any moldy odor.

Yeast is a fungoid growth, a microscopic plant capable of starting a
fermentation in various substances. It grows rapidly in a favorable
medium, as when mixed with flour and water, and kept in a warm place,
resulting in setting up fermentation. Baking powders are composed of
an acid and an alkali. Some kind of flour usually is added to keep
them dry and free from lumps. When the mixture containing the baking
powder is moistened the acid and the alkali chemically combine and
alter, a gas being generated. If the articles be placed soon in great
heat, the gas is warmed, expands, and in its endeavor to escape raises
the mass. The heat sets the mixture in this raised condition, thus the
cake or pudding is rendered light, easier to masticate and digest.

Baking powders are used for two reasons. First. To supply a gas to
take the place of ingredients, as when used in making bread, buns,
etc. If flour, salt and water were mixed and baked in a large loaf, it
would be a hard, indigestible mass. If baking powder be mixed in with
similar ingredients and baked, the result would be a light loaf, easy
to masticate and digest.

Second. It is used to save labor. When a richer mixture be made it
requires to be well beaten to mix in air. Baking powder often is added
to save some of the otherwise necessary beating.



Baking Powder Biscuits

  2 cupfuls flour
  2 tablespoonfuls Crisco
  2 teaspoonfuls baking powder[A]
  1 teaspoonful salt
  Milk

Mix and sift twice dry ingredients. Work in Crisco with finger tips,
add gradually milk, mixing with knife to soft dough. Toss on floured
board; pat and roll to one-half inch thickness. Shape with biscuit
cutter. Place on Criscoed tin and bake in hot oven twelve minutes. To
have good biscuits dough should be handled as little as possible, just
enough to get in shape to cut. Milk or water used for mixing should
be very cold, and biscuits should be gotten into oven at once after
adding liquid to flour. If top of each biscuit is lightly brushed over
with melted Crisco before baking, crust will be much nicer. Sufficient
for fifteen biscuits.

[Footnote A: Amount of baking powder may be increased if especially
raised biscuits are desired. 2 teaspoonfuls, however, is most
healthful amount.]

CAKES

[Illustration]


There are five principal ways of making cakes.

The first method is used for plain cakes. The shortening is rubbed
into the flour in the same way as for short pastry; then the dry
ingredients, such as sugar, fruit, and spice, are added, and lastly
the eggs and milk. Then all are mixed well together.

The second way is used for fruit, pound, and seed cakes. The
shortening and sugar are creamed together, the eggs beaten in one at
a time, and the fruit and flour stirred in lightly and quickly at the
last.

In the third way the eggs and sugar are beaten together until thick
and creamy, then the flour is stirred in lightly and quickly. This is
used chiefly for sponge cakes and cakes of that texture.

For the fourth way the sugar, shortening, milk, and syrup or molasses
are melted together, then cooled slightly and added to the dry
ingredients. This method is used for ginger-breads.

In the fifth way the sugar and eggs are beaten thoroughly over boiling
water, then cooled before the melted shortening and dry ingredients
are added. This method is used for Gennoise cake and some kinds of
layer cakes. Care must be taken to insure the right consistency of
cakes. The mixture should be fairly stiff. If too moist the fruit
will sink to the bottom. For rich cakes the tins should be lined with
paper, the paper coming a short distance above the tins, so that the
cake is protected as it rises. For very rich fruit cakes, experience
has shown that it is best not to grease the paper or tin. The cake is
not so liable to burn, and the paper can be removed easily when the
cake is done without injuring it. On the other hand, if tins are lined
for sponge cakes or jelly-rolls, the paper should be greased.

[Illustration]

When making cakes in which baking powder, carbonate of soda, cream of
tartar or tartaric acid are used, almost everything depends upon the
handling, which should be as light and as little as possible. The more
rapidly such cakes are made the better they will be. Two cooks working
from the same recipe will often produce entirely different results, if
one kneads her mixture as if it were household bread, while the other
handles it with due lightness of touch. As soon as the baking powder
or other rising medium is added to the mixture, the cake should be put
into the oven as quickly as possible. Soda alone is never good in a
cake where there is shortening, unless some substance containing acid
is used along with it. Molasses is one of the substances containing
acid.

The greatest care and cleanliness must be exercised in all cake
making; and accuracy in proportioning the materials to be used is
indispensable. The flour should be thoroughly dried and sifted, and
lightly stirred in. Always sift flour before measuring, then sift it
again with the baking powder to insure a thorough blending.

Good cakes never can be made with indifferent materials. Eggs are used
both as an aerating agent and as one of the "wetting" materials. It
is not economy to buy cheap eggs, for such eggs are small, weak,
colorless, and often very stale. Eggs should be well beaten, yolks and
whites separately, unless other directions are given. The yolks must
be beaten to a thick cream and the whites until they are a solid
froth. Sugar tends to improve the texture of cakes, and when cheap
cakes are made, plenty should be used, provided that the cake is not
made too sweet. It should be dissolved before being added to the fat
and the flour.

For best cakes, and all that are required of a light color,
fine-grained sugar should be used. With coarse-grained sugar there
is danger of producing specks which show on the cakes after baking,
unless they have been made by the method of beating up the eggs and
sugar together with a beater over hot water. This method will dissolve
the grains of sugar.

Always buy the best fruits for cake making, as they are sweetest and
cleanest. Currants and sultana raisins for cakes should not be too
large, but of medium size, sweet and fleshy. Cheap dry sultanas should
not be used. Though there is no need to wash sultanas, yet if the
fruit is inclined to be very dry, it will be better to do so than
to put them in to spoil the appearance and the flavor of the cake.
Currants always should be washed, cleaned, and dried before using.
Orange, lemon, and citron peel should be of good color and flavor.
They should not be added to cake mixture in chunks, as often is
done, but should be in long shredded pieces. Large pieces of peel are
sometimes the cause of a cake cutting badly. In making fruit cakes
add the fruit before the flour, as this will prevent it falling to the
bottom.

If a cake cracks open while baking, the recipe contains too much
flour. There are two kinds of thick crusts which some cakes have. The
first of these is caused by the cake being overbaked in a very hot
oven. Where this is so, the cake, if a very rich one, has a huge crack
in the top caused by the heat of the oven forming a crust before the
inside has finished aerating; then as the interior air or gas expands,
it cracks the crust to escape. This crack spoils the appearance of the
cake, and when cut it generally will be found to be close and heavy
in texture. To guard against this it is necessary to bake them at a
suitable temperature, noting that the richer the cake the longer the
fruit takes to bake.

The second kind of thick crust referred to may only be on top of the
cake, and in this case may be caused by an excess of fat and sugar
being mixed together, or otherwise insufficient flour. In this case
the mixture will not bake, but only forms a kind of syrup in the oven,
and the cake sinks in the center. A cake made under such conditions
would have a thick shiny crust, and be liable to crumble when touched.
The inside of the cake would be heavy, having more the appearance of
pudding than cake.

Successful cake making means constant care. In recipes in which milk
is used as one ingredient, either sweet or buttermilk may be used
but not a mixture of both. Buttermilk makes a light, spongy cake,
and sweet milk makes a cake which cuts like pound cake. _In creaming
shortening and sugar, when the shortening is too hard to blend easily
warm the bowl slightly, but do not heat the shortening, as this will
change both the flavor and texture of the cake._ For small cakes have
a quick oven, so that they set right through, and the inside is baked
by the time the outside is browned. For all large cakes have a quick
oven at first, to raise them nicely and prevent the fruit sinking to
the bottom. The oven then should be allowed to become slower to fire
the cakes thoroughly.

Cake must not be hurried. Keep the oven steady though slow, and after
putting a large cake into it do not open the door for at least twenty
minutes. During baking, do not open the door unnecessarily, or in
fact do anything to jar the cake lest the little bubbles formed by the
action of the baking powder burst, causing the gas to escape and the
cake to sink. This produces what is known as a "sad" cake, but refers
probably to the state of mind of the cook. A very light cake put into
a quick oven' rises rapidly round the sides, but leaves a hollow in
the middle.

If a cake is made too light with eggs or powder and an insufficient
quantity of flour is added it will drop in the center. Another
frequent cause is the moving of cakes while in the oven before the
mixture has set properly. The same defect is produced if the cakes
are removed from the oven before being baked sufficiently. When a cake
batter curdles, the texture will not be so even as if the curdling had
not taken place. Sometimes the mixture will curdle through the eggs
being added too quickly, or if the shortening contains too much water.
This forms a syrup with the sugar, and after a certain quantity of
eggs have been added the batter will slip and slide about, and will
not unite with the other ingredients. Weak, watery eggs are another
cause of this happening; and although this may be checked by adding
a little flour at the right time, yet the cake would be better if it
were unnecessary to add any flour until all the eggs had been beaten
in, that is, if the batter had not curdled. Before turning out a cake
allow it to remain in the tin for a few minutes. It is best to lay it
on a wire cake stand, or lay it on a sieve; but if you do not possess
these, a loosely made basket turned upside down will do. If the cake
will not turn out of the tin easily, rest it on its side, turning it
round in a couple of minutes and it may loosen, if not, pass a knife
round the edge, turn the cake over on a clean cloth, and let it stand
a few minutes.

Do not place cakes in a cold place or at an open window, or the steam
will condense and make them heavy. A rich cake improves in flavor and
becomes softer with keeping (from 2 to 6 weeks, according to quality)
before cutting. Wrap, when cold, first in a clean towel, then in
paper. After a week remove the paper and put the cake into a tin
wrapped in the towel. Small cakes may be baked in tiny molds or tins,
or baked in a flat sheet, and then cut out into squares, diamonds or
rounds. Then they can be frosted or coated with cream and decorated
with cherries or other crystallized fruits. If a real distinction is
desired, they may be placed in tiny crinkled paper cases, bought by
the hundred at a trifling cost.

Cake tins should be greased with Crisco and dredged with flour, the
superfluous flour shaken out, or they can be fitted with paper which
has been greased with Crisco. When creaming Crisco and sugar, do not
grudge hard work; at this stage of manufacture the tendency is to give
insufficient work, with the result that the lightness of the cake is
impaired.

VEGETARIAN DISHES

[Illustration]


Even those who are by no means decided vegetarians may be glad to pass
over a dinner occasionally without meat. It is perhaps not too much to
say that every housekeeper ought to be able to provide a meal
without the aid of meat. We do not mean by this simply the cooking of
vegetables or the preparations of puddings, but the presentation of
dishes intended to take the place of flesh, such as soups and
broths made without meat, vegetable stews, lentil fritters and other
healthful and nutritious dishes. A vegetarian menu is not so simple
as it sounds. It requires knowledge and discrimination on the
housekeeper's part to serve a solid meal without flesh or fowl.

Now that meat is so dear it is the favorable moment to try a vegetable
diet for a time. One mistake to be avoided in this catering is the
putting down of too many dishes of a pulpy character--food which
is soft is excellent with other things, but alone it is neither
satisfying nor very nourishing, at least to a person of strong
digestion. All of them should not be white, for instance, and the same
rule holds good in other things besides color. A nice dish for this
kind of diet is a vegetable curry, in which all the vegetables are
treated like meat and turned out crisp; all the vegetables, too, must
be fresh and young for this method of serving, so that anything like
stringiness is absolutely impossible.

Crisco is entirely vegetable.

  1 tablespoonful flour
  1/2 cupful bean liquor

Soak beans in water twenty-four hours, then boil for several hours
till quite tender, drain them, preserving liquor, chop them very fine;
blend Crisco with flour in saucepan over fire, add bean liquor, beans,
salt and pepper, and yolks of eggs; turn out on to a dish and set
aside till cold. Then cut out with cutlet-cutter or shape with knife;
dip in beaten whites of the eggs, then in fine breadcrumbs, repeat
a second time, and fry in hot Crisco. Serve on hot platter decorated
with a few hot cooked mixed vegetables. Sufficient for eight cutlets.

EGGS

[Illustration]


When there is any doubt as to the freshness of eggs, they may be
tested in various ways. Quite fresh eggs will sink in a strong brine,
and as they become stale they remain suspended at different depths
in the brine, until an absolutely stale egg will float. Successful
preservation depends in a great measure upon the condition of the egg
at the time of preserving. Different methods of preserving all aim
at the same thing, namely, at coating the porous shell with some
substance which will prevent the air entering and setting up
decomposition. See page 30.

When used as food, eggs should be cooked at a low temperature--about
160 deg. F., or if in the shell at about 180 deg. F. The time varies with
the size of the egg, from two and a half minutes for poaching a
medium-sized egg to four and a half minutes for boiling a large one.
If too much cooked, or at too high a temperature, the white becomes
tough, hard, and to many people, indigestible.

When required for salads, garnishing, etc., the eggs must be boiled
from ten to twenty minutes, and if the yolks are to be powdered for
sprinkling, they must be cooked for a longer time, or the centers will
be somewhat tough and elastic, and useless for the purpose.

In beating eggs, a little salt added to the whites helps to bring them
to a froth more quickly. When frothed whites are to be mixed with a
heavier or more solid substance, great care must be taken not to
break down the froth. The object of beating being to mix in air, rough
handling afterwards would render the beating useless; the mixing must
therefore be done very carefully. They should be folded or wrapped up
in the other substance, but the mixing also must be thorough, for
any pieces of white separated from the rest will toughen and taste
leathery, besides failing in the special purpose of giving lightness
to the mixture. After mixing lightly and perfectly all such
preparations should be cooked at once. The white "speck" always should
be removed from a broken egg, as it is easily distinguished after
cooking, and in anything of a liquid nature, such as custards, sauces,
etc., it would be hard and unpleasant.

CANDIES

[Illustration]


It is well to have a confectioner's thermometer for candy making,
so that the syrup may be removed from the fire at exactly the right
degree. Such thermometers are made of wood, brass, or copper, and the
degrees on them should mark not less than 350 deg.. A thermometer always
should be gently lowered into the boiling sugar. When not in use,
it should be kept hanging on a nail or hook. When required for candy
making, place thermometer in pitcher of warm water, so that it may
rise gradually, and return it to the warm water on removing it from
the hot candy. This dissolves the clinging candy and protects the tube
from breaking. The wooden thermometer can be used to stir with, and is
very easy to keep clean.

If there is no thermometer handy it is better to make a list of the
various stages in sugar boiling, and learn how to test the sugar.
First there is the "thread" (216 deg. F. to 218 deg. F.) This is reached when,
on dipping the finger and thumb first into cold water and then into
the syrup, you can draw them apart, and an unbroken thread is formed,
which gradually can be drawn wider apart on further testing as the
degree of boiling is completed.

The next is the "pearl" (220 deg. F.) To see if the syrup has reached
this stage, after the sugar has dissolved let it boil for eight to ten
minutes, then dip a wooden skewer into the syrup to obtain a drop of
it. Dip the finger and thumb into cold water, then rub the drop of
syrup between them; if it feels smooth, the syrup has reached the
desired stage. The next is the "blow" (230 deg. F.) Dip a spoon into the
sugar, shake it, and blow through the holes; if sparks of light or
bubbles be seen, you may be sure of the blow. This is followed by the
"feather" (235 deg. F.) To test this, dip a spoon into the boiling syrup,
and when it may be blown easily from the spoon in long shreds it has
reached the right degree.

[Illustration]

Next comes the "ball" (240 deg. F. to 250 deg. F.) Dip the finger and thumb
first into cold water, and then into the syrup, the latter then can be
rolled into a soft ball between the finger and thumb. A little longer
boiling gives the hard ball. This in turn is succeeded by the "crack"
(290 deg. F. to 300 deg. F.) To test this, drop a little of the syrup into
cold water; if it then breaks off sharp and crisp it has reached the
crack. The final stage is the "caramel" (350 deg. F.) which comes very
quickly after the crack, the syrup becoming first a pale yellow, and
then a rich golden brown, and finally black or burnt. When it first
reaches this stage the pan should be removed from the fire, a little
lemon juice or water added, and then the whole reboiled to the proper
stage or shade. To prevent granulation, it often is advisable to add a
pinch of cream of tartar, to the pound of sugar.

and sliced, carrot scraped and cut in pieces, bouquet garni and clove;
add stock, put in tongue, and cook until three parts done, then take
it up, and skin while hot. Strain liquor it was cooked in, take off
fat, add piquante sauce, put tongue into this, and finish cooking.
When tender, cut in slices, dish, and pour sauce over, and serve.
Mashed potatoes, spinach, or peas served with tongue is a great
improvement.

leaf, 1/2 carrot, sprig thyme, 2 tablespoons Crisco, 4 tablespoons
vinegar, half pint brown stock, 1/2 teaspoon anchovy extract, 1
tablespoon Worcestershire sauce, 3 tablespoons flour, salt and red
pepper to taste.

Peel and chop shallots, carrot, and mushrooms; melt Crisco in a
saucepan; fry vegetables a nice brown; then add vinegar, bay leaf, and
thyme. Reduce vinegar to half the quantity; stir in flour, dilute with
stock, bring to boil; then add anchovy extract, Worcestershire sauce,
salt and red pepper to taste. Take out thyme and bay leaf. Simmer for
10 minutes. Skim, and use as required.

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
