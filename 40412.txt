    It would hardly be safe to name Miss Austen, Miss Bronte, and

    would be necessary to seek police protection, and yet surely it is
    so.

    Gray found very little gratification at Cambridge in the society
    and manners of the young university men who were his
    contemporaries. They ridiculed his sensitive temper and retired
    habits, and gave him the nickname of "Miss Gray," for his supposed

    with his academic superiors. He abhorred mathematics, with the
    same cordiality of hatred which Pope professed towards them, and
    at that time concurred with Pope in thinking that the best recipe

    Shelley had many merits and many defects. This is not the place
    for a complete or indeed for any estimate of him. But one
    excellence is most evident. His words are as flexible as any
    words; the rhythm of some modulating air seems to move them into
    their place without a struggle by the poet, and almost his
    knowledge. This is the perfection of true art.

    These deeper questions cannot be treated in this short appendix to
    Descartes' life. They are mentioned here merely to show how he was
    to modern thought what Socrates was to Greek philosophy. Far
    greater, too, was he than Socrates, in the range of his influence.
    In every department of his thinking--in his first philosophy, his
    theology, his physics, his psychology, his physiology--he sowed
    the dragon's teeth from which sprang hosts of armed men, to join
    in an intellectual conflict, internecine, let us trust, to their
    many errors and prejudices, but fraught with new life and energy
    to the intellectual progress of Europe.

    Samuel Pepys stands at the head of the world's literature in his
    own department.... Pepys' "_Diary_" has been frequently compared
    with Boswell's "_Life of Johnson_," and with justice in so far as
    the charm of each arises from the inimitable naivete of the
    author's self-revelations. Boswell had a much greater character
    than his own to draw, but Pepys had to be his own Johnson. It is
    giving him no excessive praise to say that he makes himself as
    interesting as Johnson and Boswell together.... Another Milton is
    more likely to appear than another Pepys.

    In Nature there is no dirt, everything is in the right condition;
    the swamp and the worm, as well as the grass and the bird--all is
    there for itself. Only because we think that all things have a

    Until after the war we had no real novels in this country, except
    "Uncle Tom's Cabin." This is one of the great novels of the world,
    and of all time. Even the fact that slavery was done away with
    does not matter; the interest in "Uncle Tom's Cabin," never will
    pass, because the book is really as well as ideally true to human
    nature, and nobly true. It is the only great novel of ours before
    the war that I can think of.

    When money represents many things, not to love it would be to love

    No surer does the Auldgarth bridge, that his father helped to

    which nothing can abolish.

    I think it will be generally conceded that, at the time of his
    death, Mr. Lowell occupied the position of the foremost American
    citizen. In public regard, at home and abroad, his name naturally
    headed the list of prominent Americans. Looked upon as a man of
    letters, as a representative of our country in foreign lands, or
    in any of the various positions in which he appeared before the
    public, there was no one to whom it was the custom to name James
    Russell Lowell as second. Without occupying the highest rank in
    any of his vocations, he stood in front of his fellow-citizens,
    because he held so high a rank in so many of them.

    There came a new poet who, to the science of rhythm, the resources
    of expression, the gift of epic narration, the deep feeling for
    nature, to all the caprices of a delightful fancy, to all the
    favorite ideas, noble or morbid, of modern thought, knew how to
    join the language of manly passion. Thus, as it were summing up in
    himself all his forerunners, he touched all hearts; he linked
    together all admirations; he has remained the true representative,
    the last expression and final, of the poetic period to which he
    belongs. Tennyson reigns to-day almost alone in increasing and
    uncontested glory.

    Thus, when a barber and a collier fight, the barber beats the
    luckless collier-white; the dusty collier heaves his ponderous

    the barber-red; black, red, and white, in various clouds are tost,
    and in the dust they raise the combatants are lost.

    hard to handle, and when caught, only to be cherished in slimy
    waters.

    All lies disgrace a gentleman, white or black, although I grant

    when you wish to deceive the enemy. Then, your duty to your
    country warrants your lying till you are black in the face; and,
    for the very reason that it goes against your grain, it becomes,
    as it were, a sort of virtue.

    Oh! say, can you see by the dawn's early light
  What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming?--
    Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the clouds of the fight
    O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming!
  And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
  Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there;

  O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

    We may say of angling as Dr. Boteler said of strawberries:
    "Doubtless God could have made a better berry, but doubtless God
    never did"; and so, if I might be judge, God never did make a more

  His temper was of that warm susceptible kind which is caught
  with the heroic and the tender, and, which is more fitted to delight
  in the world of sentiment than to succeed in the bustle of ordinary
  life. This is a disposition of mind well suited to the poetical
  character, and, accordingly, all his earliest companions agree that
  Mr. Home was from his childhood delighted with the lofty and heroic
  ideas which embody themselves in the description or narrative of
  poetry.... Mr. Home's favorite amusement was angling.

    Yes, Walt Whitman has appeared. He has his place upon the stage.
    The drama is not ended. His voice is still heard. He is the poet of
    democracy--of all people. He is the poet of the body and soul. He

    primeval. He is the Poet of Humanity--of Intellectual Hospitality.

      How beautiful is night!
    A dewy freshness fills the silent air;
  No mist obscures; nor cloud, nor speck, nor stain,
    Breaks the serene of heaven:
    In full-orbed glory, yonder moon divine
    Rolls through the dark blue depths;
      Beneath her steady ray
      The desert circle spreads
  Like the round ocean, girdled with the sky.

    Among living authors Haggard is unquestionably first. I find two
    very remarkable qualities in Mr. Haggard's novels,--a power of
    imagination in which, for audacity and strength, he is unequalled
    since the Elizabethan dramatists. Secondly there is the mesmeric
    influence which he exercises over his readers.

    Shakespeare--that is, English tragedy--postulates the intense life

    In the Confessions of St. Augustine, passion, nature,
    individuality only appear in order to be immolated to Divine
    grace. They are a history of a crisis of the soul, of a new birth,
    of a _Vita Nuova_; the Saint would have blushed to relate more
    than he has done of the life of the man, which he had quitted.
    With Rousseau the case is precisely the reverse; here grace is
    nothing, nature everything; nature dominant, triumphant,
    displaying herself with a daring freedom, which at times amounts
    to the distasteful--nay, to the disgusting.

    Equality is one of the most consummate scoundrels that ever crept
    from the brain of a political juggler--a fellow who thrusts his

    There is what I call the American idea.... This idea demands, as
    the proximate organization thereof, a democracy--that is, a
    government of all the people, by all the people, for all the
    people; of course, a government of the principles of eternal
    justice, the unchanging law of God: for shortness' sake I will
    call it the idea of Freedom.

    Socrates, like Solon, thought that no man is too old to learn;
    that to learn and to know is not a schooling for life, but life

    appeared to both to be the real duty of man.

    Let the soldier be abroad if he will, he can do nothing in this
    age. There is another personage,--a personage less imposing in the
    eyes of some, perhaps insignificant. The schoolmaster is abroad,
    and I trust to him, armed with his primer, against the soldier in
    full military array.

    How few take time for friendship! How few plan for it! It is
    treated as a haphazard, fortuitous thing. May good luck send us
    friends; we will not go after them. May favoring fortune bind our
    friendships; we will take no stitches ourselves. Yet friendship
    requires painstaking. No art is so difficult, no craft so arduous.
    Roll a ball of clay and expect it to become a rose in your hand,
    but never expect an acquaintanceship, without care and thought, to
    blossom into friendship.

    Manners must adorn knowledge, and smooth its way through the

    I never yet heard man or woman much abused, that I was not

    When he writes of himself, how supremely excellent is the reading.
    It is good even when he does it intentionally, as in "Portraits
    and Memories." It is better still when he sings it, as in his
    "Child's Garden." He is irresistible to every lonely child who

    for only in it and in my dreams when I am touched with fever, do I
    grasp the long, long thoughts of a lonely child and a
    hill-wandering boy-thoughts I never told to any; yet which Mr.
    Stevenson tells over again to me as if he read them off a printed
    page.

  A life on the ocean wave!
    A home on the rolling deep,
  Where the scattered waters rave,

  O give me the flashing brine,
    The spray and the tempest's roar!

    Logic makes only one demand, that of science. But life makes a
    thousand. The body wants health; the imagination cries out for

    being is athirst for happiness and for perfection.

  Here's to the maiden of bashful fifteen;
    Here's to the widow of fifty;

    Peel was, undoubtedly, as Lord Beaconsfield has said, a great
    member of Parliament; but he was surely much more than that, he
    was a great statesman, a great Minister. He must always rank among
    the foremost of English Ministers. The proud boast of Heine is
    that, if any one names the best half-dozen of German poets his
    name must be brought among them. If we name the best half-dozen of
    modern English Prime Ministers, we can hardly fail to bring in the
    name of Peel.

    genius was still in its dawn.

  Rising in clouded majesty, at length
  Apparent queen unveil'd her peerless light,
  And o'er the dark her silver mantle threw.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
