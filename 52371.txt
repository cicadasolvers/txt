PREFATORY NOTE

By Richard Gottheil, Ph.D.

Chief of the Oriental Division


Few people have been the subject of so much pity and commiseration
as have the Armenians. And few have deserved such pity as fully as
have they. A remarkable race, they have had an uncommon history. They
have always written and spoken an Indo-European language, one that
belongs to that large number of which the Sanskrit is an early and
prominent representative. According to their traditions, they are
also of Indo-European race; though evidently intermixed with Semitic
and other blood. Historically, they come to our notice at first in
ancient Phrygia; and, peculiarly enough, seem to have reversed the
general order and to have travelled towards the rising sun instead of
towards the west. The Empire of the Hittites was breaking up, and the
Armenians appear to have settled in the upper reaches of the Euphrates,
to have extended their quarters into the region of Lakes Van and
Urmia and to have made their home around Mt. Ararat. Unfortunately,
the Armenians were never able to hold out long as an independent
kingdom. In antiquity the greater Powers of Greece, of Seleucid Syria,
of Persia and of Rome were at hand, ready to prevent the assertion
of any rights that might controvert their own. At one time, it is
true, that which historians call Armenia Major and Armenia Minor--the
Caucasus regions south of the mountains and north of Mesopotamia--were
ruled by independent kings, especially under Tigranes II, termed the
Great (94-56 B. C.), who extended his power to take in a good deal
of the former kingdom of Assyria, the northwest corner of Persia, the
province of Azerbaijan, a territory said to have covered some 500,000
square miles and to have contained some 3,000,000 inhabitants. His
royal city was called after his own name--Tigranocerta; and it
is sufficient to record Cicero's saying that "Tigranes made the
Republic of Rome tremble before his powers." But Rome's watchful
eye was envious of such power, and under Lucullus, in 69 B. C.,
Armenian independence was put down--not to be raised again for many
centuries. At a later date she became the playball between Byzantium
and Persia, who in their continued strife swarmed up and down her
land carrying destruction in their wake. Weakened as she thus was,
she was in no condition to withstand the onslaughts made upon her by
the Arab hordes that swarmed up through northern Mesopotamia in 636
A.D. But, withal, her people held firmly to their heritage. From time
to time attempts at freedom were made and independent kings ruled
for a nonce and after a fashion. Vartan did this in from 571 until
578 under the Byzantines. Ashot I was semi-independent in 885 under
the auspices of Arab overlords.

But such attempts as these were not productive of good. They opened
the way for internal strife and for the entry of those Tartar hordes
in the eleventh century that were destined finally to overrun the
whole country. Here again the tenacity of the Armenians told its
tale. Small independent kingdoms were established at Ani, in Georgia
and near Lake Van. But the coming of Toghril Beg soon ended their
existence. In 1071, the Turks drove the Byzantines out of Armenia and
began that series of depredations and plunder through which they have
made their name infamous. In 1239, Jenghiz Khan was there; and when the
Turks were at rest, the Kurds were ready to supplement their work. An
exodus was begun, the first of many the Armenians have had to suffer
during their long and tragic history. Multitudes were driven out of
the country into Poland, into Moldavia and Galicia,--even around the
north of the Caspian Sea, where in Lemberg, an important colony was
founded. Some wandered to the South and founded settlements in the
mountains of Cilicia which were able to exist for some 300 years,
although they were looked at askance by Byzantium because of their
peculiar church government.

In 1375, the country was conquered by the Ottomans; but so strong
is the desire of the Armenians for freedom that a small body of them
withdrew into the recesses of the Taurus mountains and refused--with
success--down to the present day, to pay taxes to the government
at Constantinople. The Armenians were overrun by Tamerlane in 1401,
by the Sultan Selim I in 1514, by the Persians in 1575 and 1639. It
was therefore natural that, when the Russian armies came upon the
scene and offered to release the Christian peoples from the yoke of
the Turk they were received with joy. Etchmiadzin, which for a time
had been Persian, became Russian by the treaty of Turkman-Chai in
1828. Whatever fault we may in truth find with the manner in which the
former Russian government treated its subject peoples, very little
can be said against its method of dealing with the Armenians. It
is true that a strong attempt at Russification was commenced during
the closing years of the nineteenth century. This went so far that
in 1898, under the governorship of Prince Galitzin, many Armenian
schools were taken over, and in 1903 much Armenian church property
was condemned. But nothing was done to disturb the daily life of
the Armenians who grew numerous and flourished in that part of the
Caucasus that was under Russian surveillance. The Plain of Erivan and
the Valley of the Araxes River are their chief residing places. Here,
though in close contact with Tartars, Lazes and Kurds, they have
preserved their separate existence, and have cherished with ardor the
details of their older life. Etchmiadzin was originally a religious
settlement--a monastery encircled by high battlements. But for the
Armenians it is not only a religious center. It is more than this. It
has become a national rallying point towards which all Armenians look
with a peculiar attachment and affection.

One would have imagined that such tenacity in holding on to what they
considered to be the truth would have received the recognition it
deserved on the part of the leading political forces in Europe. But
that was asking too much. The lot of the Armenians who were under
Turkish overlordship gradually grew worse. It is true that the Draft
Treaty of San Stefano called for "improvements and reforms demanded
by local requirements in the provinces inhabited by Armenians," and
guaranteed "their security from Kurds and Circassians." But the final
Berlin Treaty of 1878 had whittled this down to a simple promise of
reform "for the protection of Christian and other subjects of the
Porte." This meant, of course, that nothing was to be done. Turkey
was astute enough to know this; and the great arbiter of fate in the
Europe of his time, Bismarck, had said openly that the Germans had
no care for Armenian reforms.

Soon the massacres commenced that unfortunately carried the tale
of Armenian sufferings all over the world. Beginning at Mush, in
1893, they have lasted with more or less continuity down to our own
day. Unfortunately, such place-names as Erzerum (1895) and Adana (1909)
are too familiar to our ears. The hope was felt and openly expressed
that the coming of the Young Turk would bring a change in the treatment
of the Armenians; but Enver, Talaat, and Djavid have certainly done
their best to prove that though the Turk may change from "old" to
"young" he still remains a Turk. "The first phase of Ottoman policy
towards subject peoples was neglect; the Hamidian was attrition; but
the Young Turkish phase is extermination." The report presented in 1916
by Viscount Bryce on "The Treatment of the Armenians in the Ottoman
Empire," is the severest indictment that could be presented against a
people and against their political backers. From 800,000 to 1,000,000
of these Armenians are said, on reliable authority, to have perished.

At an early date the Armenians accepted Christianity. They themselves
believe that the new faith was preached to them by the apostles
Thaddai and Bartholomew. But it was not until the year 301 that Gregory
the Illuminator persuaded their king Tiridates officially to accept
Christianity for the state and the people as a whole. And just as they
have preserved their national identity, so they have kept themselves
apart as a church--called the "Gregorian," after the saint mentioned
above. They followed the decisions of the Council of Nicea (325) of
Constantinople (381) and of Ephesus (381), but refused to regard the
Council of Chalcedon as legally convened; and at a synod of their own,
composed of Armenian and Georgian bishops, held at Driune in 506, the
Armenians definitely wedded themselves to the Council of Ephesus and
the theological doctrines propounded there. The Armenian Church stands
thus, in no connection either with the Greek or the Roman Church. In
the 18th century, it is true, a certain bishop Mekhitar, of Sebaste,
joined the Roman Hierarchy and established at Venice the Mekitarist
Monastery that has done some excellent literary and educational
work, and that in Turkey a Kotolik Milleti (Catholic Nation), was
established in 1835, through Roman influence. But neither have any
connection with the Armenian Church as such. The Oriental character
of this church may be seen from the fact that its weekly day of rest
lasts from Saturday sun-down up to Sunday evening.

At an equally early date the Armenians showed a taste for literary
expression, and so eager are they for education that in the year 1902,
and under all the circumstances of Turkish oppression, they had no less
than 1,200 Armenian schools in the Ottoman empire, giving instruction
to 130,000 pupils. Their script is said to have come to them from a
certain Syrian Daniel and to have been enlarged and perfected by their
own Saint Mesrob in 410, who added the vowel signs after the manner
of the Greek system. It was to this same Mesrob, assisted by Sahak
(Isaac; 387-439), to whom the Armenians owe the translation of both the
Old and New Testament into their tongue. Much of the older literature
is composed of translations from Greek and from Syriac authors, but,
in a certain sense, a national literature was growing up--though,
as was natural, it was largely theological in character. Yet valuable
historical works were written by Moses of Khorene, by Mesrob, and in
the twelfth century, by Nerses Shnorhali. Some poetry has also been
written, though this, too, is chiefly of a religious turn. Printing in
Armenia was introduced by the Patriarch Mikhael of Sebaste (1542-1570)
though some years prior to this--in 1512--a press that used Armenian
type had been set up in Venice. The first Armenian book to be printed
in England dates from the year 1736; the first to be put out in
Russia from 1771; but it was not until 1857 that an Armenian book
left the press in America. In quite modern times large quantities of
Armenian literature have been published dealing with a great variety
of topics. Wherever they are, the Armenians are in the forefront of
those who work and strive; they have large capacity and when they
will once again be settled in their ancient home in Asia Minor and
in northern Mesopotamia, to which 500,000 are ready to return at a
moment's notice, we shall look forward to a development that will be
as remarkable as it will be thorough. Prior to the calamities of this
war, Armenian historians reckoned the number of their fellow-racials
to be 4,160,000--of whom 2,380,000 were in the Turkish empire.

The following list deals with the various subjects to which reference
has been made in these pages. Whatever excellence it has is due
to the care and vigilance of Miss Pratt. I am also beholden to
Mr. V. H. Kalendarian for the help he has given in verifying the
transliteration of the Armenian titles.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
