PREFACE.


The object of this work, as will be seen, is to bring together the great
events of each day of the year, in all ages, as far as their dates can
be ascertained, and to arrange them chronologically. It has been
necessary to observe brevity in its compilation, in order to reduce it
within a proper compass. Hence notices of the most eminent men are often
confined to two or three lines, while individuals of less note have
occasionally received more attention, on account of the absence of ready
reference to them in books.

The dates are in accordance, it is believed, with the best authorities.
Great care has been taken to make them so, and nothing has been inserted
for which there was not at least some authority. Occasionally authors
have been found to disagree in days, months, and even years, and it has
been necessary to reconcile, as well as possible, such discrepancies.
Much of this confusion arises from the change in the calendar; some
authors following the old, others the new style, without informing us
which they adhere to. The protestant countries did not all adopt the new
style till 1777, about two centuries after the catholic authorities had
reformed the calendar. The Russians still use the Julian era, and are
now consequently twelve days behind the true time. With these
difficulties in the way, no ordinary vigilance ensures an entire freedom
from error in a work like this. The dates here, however, are made to
conform to the new style as far as practicable. In some cases where
different dates have been given, and it has been found impossible to
determine the true one, the article has been inserted under different
days with cross references. Repetitions have crept in however, which
could only be discovered in preparing the index. Errors of this kind are
perpetuated by a succession of authors following a wrong date, and are
exceedingly difficult to detect, or when suspected, not easily traced to
their origin. When dates have been taken from computations of time other
than the Christian era, it should be understood that the corresponding
day has been made to conform to our own era, and consequently perfect
accuracy can not be claimed for them.

It has been said that geography and chronology are the eyes of history;
in aiding to promote one of these sciences, the reader will not fail to
discover how great and varied is the amount of facts brought together,
rendering the work of use to persons of every age and calling. A
reference to the index will show more clearly the extent of the work.




EVERY DAY BOOK

OF

HISTORY AND CHRONOLOGY.




JANUARY.


JANUARY 1.

154 B. C. It was fixed that the Roman consuls should always enter upon
their office on this day, and the years were named after them. On this
occasion they went in solemn procession to the Capitol to sacrifice to
Jupiter Capitolinus; after which the senate held a solemn session. Those
who had discharged the office of consul enjoyed the pre-eminence of rank
over the other senators. They were annually elected by the people till
the time of Tiberius, who ordered that they should be chosen by the
senate. The last consul after whom the year was named, was Barsilius, in
the year 541, in the reign of Justinianus.

38. B. C. The Spanish era, or era of the Caesars, commenced, being the
year following the conquest of Spain by Augustus. It was much used in
Africa, Spain and the south of France; but was abolished by one kingdom
after another during the fourteenth century, and by Portugal 1555.

404. TELEMACHUS, or St. Almachus, whose story is the foundation of
Fenelon's famed work _Telemaque_, suffered martyrdom at Rome.

1109. The Festival of Fools was instituted at Paris, and continued
prosperous for 240 years. This, with the Lords of Misrule, and the
Abbots of Unreason, was doubtless designed to ridicule the Druidic
saturnalia.

1308. WILLIAM TELL, the Swiss patriot, associated himself on this day
with a band of his countrymen against the tyranny of their oppressors.

1349. EDWARD III, king of England, defeated the French before Calais
with great slaughter.

1504. Birthday of CASPER CRUCIGER, an extensive and multifarious
scholar, and a follower of Luther. He died 1548.

1515. LOUIS XII of France, surnamed _the father of the people_, died.
Notwithstanding the faults of his education, which had been purposely
neglected, he became a wise and politic monarch, who had the welfare and
improvement of his country in mind. Though extensively engaged in wars,
he avoided burdening the people with taxes--was economical, just and
magnanimous.

1513. JUAN DIAZ DE SOLIS, coasting the southern continent, discovered
the mouth of a river on this day, which in consequence he called Rio
Janeiro.

1516. JUAN DIAZ DE SOLIS again entered the Rio de Solis which he had
discovered three years previous. In attempting a descent on the country
he was slain by the natives, who in sight of the ship cut his body in
pieces, and roasted and devoured it. He was reputed the ablest navigator
in the world.

1523. Knights of Malta driven from the island of Rhodes by the Turks.

1537. JAMES V of Scotland married Magdalen, daughter of Francis I of
France.

1617. HENRY GOLTZIUS, a distinguished Dutch painter and engraver, died.
His father was a painter on glass, and gave his son instructions in the
art; but it was his own genius and application that raised him to the
rank he ultimately held among the best artists of the time.

1618. Charter of the first New Netherland company expired by its own
limitation.

1618. Birthday of BARTHOLOMEW ESTEBAN MURILLO, the greatest of all the
Spanish painters. He was employed by the churches and convents of
Seville a great number of years, which were enriched by the masterly
productions of his pencil, and procured for himself an independent
fortune. Having been invited to Cadiz, he there executed his grand
picture of St. Catharine; but just as he was about to finish it he was
dreadfully wounded on the scaffolding, and died at Seville, 1682.

1630. THOMAS HOBSON, the celebrated carrier of Cambridge, England,
died. One of the most general proverbial expressions in England
originated with him. He let to students and others horses, and his
practice was to secure equal portions of rest as well as work for each
horse. Hence when applied to for any, none but that which had its due
proportion of rest could be let. "This or none" was the answer. Hence
the phrase "Hobson's choice; this or none."

1644. MICHOB ADER, calling himself the Wandering Jew, appeared at Paris,
where he created an extraordinary sensation among all ranks. He
pretended to have lived sixteen hundred years, and that he had traveled
through all regions of the world. He was visited by the literati of the
city, and no one could accost him in a language that he was ignorant of;
he was also familiar with the history of persons and events from the
time of Christ, so that he was never confounded by intricate or
cross-questions; but replied readily and without embarrassment. The
learned looked upon him as a counterfeit, or madman, yet they took their
leave of him bewildered and astonished.

1651. CHARLES II crowned king of Scotland at Scone.

1661. A parliament met in Scotland.

1700. The Russians began their new year.

1715. WILLIAM WYCHERLEY died, aged 81, an eminent English dramatic
writer and comic poet.

1727. CLAUDE ADRIAN HELVETIUS died; a celebrated Dutch physician, who,
having obtained celebrity by introducing the use of ipecacuanha in
dysentery, was made inspector general of military hospitals, and died at
London.

1729. Great fog in London, persons lost their way in St. James' park,
and many fell into the canal.

1730. SAMUEL SEWALL, chief justice of the supreme court of Massachusetts
died.

1731. EDWARD CAVE printed the first number of the well known
_Gentleman's Magazine_.

1748. Birthday of GODFREY AUGUSTUS BURGER, a celebrated German poet, and
the writer of that whimsical satire, _Munchausen's Travels_.

1748. JOHN BERNOUILLI, a Swiss mathematician, died. He was born at Basil
in Switzerland, and educated for a merchant, but afterwards studied
medicine, and finally devoted his attention to mathematics with great
success. He was the contemporary of Leibnitz and De L'Hopital, and of
Newton. His labors in the science were indefatigable, and his works
contain an immense mass of discovery. But the details of his private
life exhibit an unusual degree of acerbity and disingenuousness.

1752. The new style commenced this day in England by act of parliament.
(See March 25.)

1757. Calcutta surrendered to the British under Admiral Watson, Colonel
Clive and Captain Coote.

1761. Great hurricane in the East Indies, destroying a part of the
British fleet; of the crews of three of the ships lost but 14 were saved
out of 1100.

1776. Norfolk Burnt. Lord Dunmore, the royal governor of Virginia,
having abandoned the town and retired on board his ships, became
distressed for provisions; and on the arrival of the Liverpool man of
war, the inhabitants refusing to supply his majesty's ships, the place
was reduced to ashes. The provincials themselves destroyed the houses
and plantations near the water, to deprive the ships of every resource
of supply.

1781. Revolt of the Pennsylvania line at Morristown, N. J. They had
enlisted for three years, and that term having expired they wished to be
discharged.

1787. ARTHUR MIDDLETON, a signer of the Declaration of Independence,
died. He was a native of South Carolina, born 1743, and educated in
England; and at the age of twenty-two made the tour of Europe. On the
breaking out of the war he engaged warmly on the side of the colonies.
In 1779 he distinguished himself in the defence of Charleston against
the British, who afterwards ravaged his plantation and rifled his
mansion, by which he suffered an immense loss of property; and in the
following year he was taken prisoner. On the termination of the contest
he returned to his native seat, and spent the remainder of his life in
elegant and philosophical ease--a model of private wealth and public
virtue; a firm patriot and an enlightened philanthropist.

1793. A beginning was made upon the Pennsylvania state canal, at
Conewago falls; seventeen rocks being blasted--one for each stockholder
of the canal company.

1794. The French convention abolished flogging in the army and navy and
substituted other punishments more congenial with the spirit of the
times.

1794. THOMAS PAINE and ANACHARSIS CLOOTS arrested by order of
Robespierre and sent to prison in Paris.

1801. Ceres discovered by Piazzi, the astronomer, at Palermo.

1804. The numerous army which France had sent against the negroes of
Hayti being compelled by disasters to fly to St. Domingo, the general
and chiefs of the Haytian army entered into a solemn compact, in the
name of _the people of Hayti_; renouncing all dependence on France, and
appointed Dessalines, the oldest general, governor for life, with very
extensive powers.

1806. The French republican calendar abolished, and the Christian era
and reformed calendar restored.

1806. The elector of Wurtemberg proclaimed king of Swabia, and the
elector of Bavaria king of Bavaria.

1807. Curacoa surrendered to the British under Sir Charles Brisbane.

provisions.

1811. Spanish cortes forbid the people obeying any act of Ferdinand XII,
while a prisoner of Bonaparte.

1813. JEAN MOURTRIE, a Frenchman, died at the age of 115. He was a
tilemaker, and continued his occupation to the age of 109. He was a
pattern of honor and integrity; his gaiety made the young fond of his
society; and his mild and even temper and kind disposition gained him
the love of all who knew him.

1814. Great fog in London, which had commenced on the 27th of December,
was now at its greatest density, extending seventy miles from the
metropolis. Many persons lost their lives by falling into the river, and
canals, and other places.

1814. The allied army entered France.

1814. American dragoons under Capt. Stone advanced on Buffalo,
accompanied by Lieuts. Riddle, Totman and Frazer, of the United States
regiment; the militia retiring, Totman was killed, and Riddle narrowly
escaped being captured.

1815. WILLIAM CREECH, bookseller and twice lord provost of Edinburgh,
died. He was a spirited writer.

1815. The British under Gen. Packenham opened a battery of two 18
pounders on the Americans at New Orleans; it was silenced the same day.
The Americans had a boat loaded with military stores sunk; 34 men killed
and wounded, and two caissons blown up by rockets. Gen. Thomas joined
Gen. Jackson same day with 660 men from Baton Rouge.

1816. WILLIAM HILLHOUSE died, aged 88; for more than 50 years a member
of the council and legislature of Connecticut.

1817. MARTIN HENRY KLAPROTH, a German chemist and philosopher, died. He

1825. Great Britain acknowledged the independence of the South American
republics.

1835. CHARLES LAMB died. He was the author of the beautiful stories of
_Elia_, which are universally admired. His exquisite humor, fancy,
feeling and wit, have given an endurable character to his essays. The
bettering of the condition of mankind was his great aim, and he was in
the esteem of every philanthropist.

1835. First daily paper in Buffalo, New York.

1837. SAMUEL HULSE died at Chelsea Hospital, England, of which he had
been governor since 1820, aged 90. He entered the British army in the
year 1761, and at the time of his death had been upwards of three
quarters of a century in the military service, and was then field
marshal.

said that this and a subsequent shock were both predicted by a Walachian
almanac maker.

had been scarcely less than 75 years in the military ranks.

1854. Great fire at Constantinople destroyed 400 houses; among which
were those of the Greek patriarch, and the patriarch of Jerusalem.


JANUARY 2.

17. TITUS LIVIUS died at Padua. His history of Rome, to which he devoted
twenty years, rendered him so celebrated, that a Spaniard is said to
have gone from Cadiz to Rome for the purpose merely of seeing him. His
history was written in 140 books, of which only 35 are extant. Five of
these were discovered at Worms 1731, and some fragments are said to have
been since found at Herculaneum. Few particulars of his life are known,
but his fame was great even while he lived, and his history has made him
immortal.

17. PUBLIUS OVIDUS NASO, the Roman poet, died in exile at Tomos (a town
on the inhospitable coast of the Black sea), aged 60. He exhibited an
unconquerable predilection for poetry, and the ease and the enjoyments
of life, which his fortune placed within his power. He traveled in
Greece and Asia which added to his accomplishments; his works were
adapted to the public taste, and he was esteemed by the learned: Horace
and Virgil were his friends, and he was a welcome visitor at the court
of Augustus. Until his fiftieth year he appears to have lived almost
solely for poetry and pleasure. He might have hoped to pass the
remaining years of his life in peace, under the shadow of his laurels,
but he was suddenly banished by Augustus, for some unknown cause. His
_Metamorphoses_, and _Art of Love_ are often republished in our
language. He painted nature with a masterly hand, and his genius
imparted elegance to vulgarity; but impurity defiles the sweetness of
his numbers, and his finest productions are sullied with licentiousness.

1547. Conspiracy of Genoa, headed by John Lewis Fiesco; his being
drowned in the night, occasioned the failure of the scheme, in the very
moment of success.

1604. The Jesuits reinstated in France.

1731. A reprieve sent to a prisoner at Newgate on condition he would
suffer Mr. Chiselden to make an experiment on the tympanum of his ear.
The experiment was never performed.

1741. JOHN BARBER, printer to the city of London, and the first printer
that rose to the rank of mayor, died.

1757. Calcutta retaken by the English and permitted to be fortified by
the subah.

1758. The Whitefield methodists observed this day in thanksgiving for
the victories of the king of Prussia in favor of England.

1759. The French surprised and captured Frankfort on the Maine.

1766. JAMES EDWARD FRANCIS STUART, the Pretender, died. He was the
eldest son of James II, born at London 1688. He was five months old when
his father was dethroned, and the royal family fled to France. His elder
sister Anne afterwards came to the throne, and some effort was made to
secure his own succession; but it does not appear that he entered into
the project with much spirit.

1771. LEWIS CAESAR, count d'Estrees, marshal of France, and minister of
state, died aged 76. He distinguished himself in the war against Spain,
and afterwards in 1741, wherein his bravery was conspicuous and his
services meritorious. In 1756 he was placed at the head of the French
forces in Germany, but was superceded by Richelieu through intrigue.

1774. The coffin of EDWARD I opened by a deputation from the society of
antiquarians, after it had been buried 467 years. In a coffin of yellow
stone they found the royal body in perfect preservation, enclosed in two
wrappers; one of them was gold tissue, strongly waxed and fresh; the
other and outermost considerably decayed. The corpse was habited in a
rich mantle of purple lined with white and adorned with ornaments of
gilt metal, studded with red and blue stones and pearls. Two similar
ornaments lay on the hands. The mantle was fastened on the right
shoulder by a magnificent _fibula_ of the same metal, with the same
stones and pearls. His face had over it a silken covering, so fine, and
so closely fitted to it, as to preserve the features entire. Round his
temples was a gilt coronet of _fleur de lys_. In his hands, which were
also entire, were two sceptres of gilt metal; that in the right
surmounted by a cross fleure, that in the left by three clusters of oak
leaves, and a dove on a globe. The feet enveloped in the mantle and
other coverings were sound and the toes distinct. Its length was 6 feet
2 inches.

1777. Cannonading at Trenton; the British repulsed in their attempt to
cross Sanpink creek bridge. In the night Gen. Washington retired leaving
his fires burning.

1780. The Dutch admiral, Count Byland, refusing to permit the British
admiral, Fielding, to search his convoy, an action ensued, and the Dutch
ships, two of the line and two frigates, surrendered; after detaining
seven of the convoy, the Dutch admiral had permission to proceed; but he
refused without the whole of his charge, and therefore sailed into
Spithead.

1788. Georgia ratified the Constitution of the United States, without
amendment, being the fourth state to do so.

1795. JOSIAH WEDGEWOOD, the inventor of the scale that bears his name in
the thermometer for determining the different degrees of metallic heat,
died at his residence in England.

1801. JOHN GASPER CHRISTIAN LAVATER died. He was born at Zurich, in
Switzerland, where his father was a physician of skill and reputation.
In 1763 he traveled in Germany; in 1767 appeared as a poet; and in 1769
as a preacher of much popularity. All his activity was devoted to
religion until he undertook his work on physiognomy. This great work in
4 vols. quarto, in which he had collected the features of distinguished
persons from all parts of the world, made him known throughout Europe.
He published several other works, and became so popular that his
journeys resembled triumphs. On the capture of Zurich by Massena, he
received a shot while assisting the wounded in the street, which
although he lived more than a year, and wrote several works, was the
cause of his death.

1809. Two French ships of war and eleven victualers, proceeding to
Barcelona, were captured in the port of Caldagues by the British under
Lord Cochrane.

1809. Penguin island, at the cape of Good Hope, sank, and is now only
known to mariners by name.

1810. Orders were received from Paris by Murat, king of Naples, to seize
and immediately dispose of all American vessels and cargoes.

1814. Dantzic surrendered to the duke of Wurtemberg.

1815. The prince regent of England extended the military order of Bath,
and divided it into three classes, namely: 1. Knights grand crosses; 2.
Knights commanders; 3. Companions.

1816. LOUIS BERNARD GUYTON DE MORVEAU, a French chemist, died. He was
born at Dijon 1737, and distinguished himself in 1773 by the invention
of the method of purifying the air by means of chlorine. He was an
upright, able, eloquent and business man; and founded a school at Dijon
for the study of his favorite science, chemistry. He was a member of the
national assembly and convention at the time of the revolution, and
assisted to establish the polytechnic school.

1827. JOHN MASON GOOD, an English physician, poet and philological
writer, died. At the age of 15 he was apprenticed to a surgeon; in 1793
removed to London, and by talent and perseverance, succeeded in
establishing both a literary and professional fame. He was a voluminous
writer, and the extent and variety of his works evince the greatest
industry, and a retentive and orderly mind. He acquired thirteen
European and Asiatic languages, and at the time of his death had just
completed a translation of the Psalms.

1829. Forty men and thirty horses destroyed by an explosion of fire damp
in a mine near Lyons, France.

1831. BERTHOLD GEORGE NIEBUHR the historian, died. He was the son of
Niebuhr the traveler, born at Copenhagen 1777, and finished his
education at Edinburgh. He traveled much and received great attention
wherever he went. In 1810 he delivered his lectures on Roman history at
Berlin; and in 1815, on the death of his father, planned and published
his biography. In 1827 he published the first volume of a remodeled
edition of his Roman history; the second volume appeared a few months
before his death, leaving the third unpublished.

1835. ROBERT HINDMARSH, the most distinguished among those who supported
the religious views of Emanuel Swedenborg, died at Gravesend.

1837. JOHN CUFFEE, a negro slave, died at Norfolk, Va., at the
remarkable age of about 120 years. He was a native of Africa, was sold
as a slave in the island of Barbadoes, and brought to Norfolk about
1740.

1850. GEORGE BLATTERMAN, professor of modern languages in the Virginia
university, died at Charlottesville.

1853. A new and stringent law against the liberty of the press was
published in Spain.

1857. ANDREW URE, author of the _Dictionary of Arts_, died at London,
aged 89.


JANUARY 3.

456. B. C. MYRONIDES the Athenian general defeated the Boeotians at
Enophyta.

106. B. C. Birthday of MARCUS TULLIUS CICERO, the Roman orator.

1641. JEREMIAH HORROX, an English astronomer, died. He seems to have
been the first to observe the transit of Venus over the sun's disc, from
which he deduced many useful observations, though not aware of the full
importance of that phenomenon.

1661. Secretary PEPYS seeing the comedy of the _Beggars' Bush_ performed
at Lincoln Inn Fields, says: "And here the first time that ever I saw
women upon the stage."

1670. GEORGE MONK, duke of Albemarle, died. He entered the British army
at an early age; and in 1639 was engaged in the unfortunate expedition
of Charles I against the Scots. He was confined three years in the Tower
under the parliament, during which he wrote a work on military and
political affairs; but finally accepted a commission in the republican
army against the Irish, the Scotch and the Dutch. But at the death of
the Protector he employed his influence to reinstate the Stuarts. In
1666 he was again employed against the son of his old antagonist Tromp,
in which the English fleet was much damaged, and both claimed the
victory.

1717. LAMBERT BOSS, an eminent Dutch philologist, died. He was born in
Friesland 1670; studied under his father who was a clergyman, became
private tutor in a family of rank, and subsequently professor of Greek
in the university of Franeker. He was an indefatigable student, and
regretted every moment which could not be devoted to his favorite
pursuit. The number and character of his works mark his industry.

1724. PHILIP V of Spain abdicated the throne in favor of his son Louis;
but he dying the same year, Philip resumed the crown again.

1730. The Turks began to learn the art of war and fortification after
the European model, from Count Bonneval of France, who became a
Musselman.

1777. Battle of Princeton, N. J., between the British and a division of
the American army, under General Washington. The British lost 100 men,
and 300 more who had taken refuge in the college, were forced to
surrender.

1795. JOSIAH WEDGEWOOD died. His father was a Staffordshire potter, to
whose business he succeeded, and soon distinguished himself by his
discoveries and improvements, insomuch that in a few years England,
instead of importing the finer earthen wares, was enabled to supply her
neighbors. He was a scientific, as well as an active and enterprising
man--and benevolent withal.

1797. Three of the large stones in the antique pile at Stonehenge in
England fell, the smallest of which weighed 20 tons. They were loosed,

liberal fortune in the collection of rare manuscripts and relics of
ancient art, and died at the age of 68, bequeathing his collection of
antiquities to the British Museum.

1805. ALEXANDER WEDDERBURN, lord of Rosslyn, died. He distinguished
himself as a lawyer, and was appointed solicitor general in 1771, in
which office he is _remarkable_ for having insulted Franklin in arguing
on American affairs before the privy council. He joined the
administration under Pitt, in 1793, and succeeded Lord Thurlow as
chancellor; from which office he retired in 1801, with the title of Earl
of Rosslyn. He is the author of a work on the management of prisons.

1698. The palace, except the banqueting house, of White-hall palace, in

1707. LOUIS WILLIAM I, marquis of Baden-Baden, died. He was born at
Paris 1655, where his mother wished to educate him; but his father and
grandfather stole him away at the age of three months, that he might
pass his childhood among the people whom he was destined to govern. He
served his first campaign under Montellucco against Turenne. He was in
Vienna when that city was besieged by the Turks, and subsequently
commanded against the Turks in the Danube. He was one of the greatest
generals of his time; made 26 campaigns, commanded at 25 sieges, fought
at 13 battles, yet was never really defeated.

sessions of congress since 1774.

1778. The British, under Col. Campbell, landed at the mouth of Savannah
river, Ga., and defeated the Americans under Gen. Robert Howe. They took

He was born at York, Va., 1738. His father was an opulent merchant and
sent him to England for an education. He returned 1761, and in 1774 had
become a statesman of some note. Three years afterwards he was appointed
brigadier general and commander in chief of the Virginia forces, and in
1781 succeeded Jefferson as governor of the state. His services elicited
the public thanks of Washington.

eloquence at Halle, where he published a periodical for the ladies
called the _Iris_. He was afterwards connected with several periodicals.
His works are published in 7 vols.

1825. FERDINAND IV of Naples died. The life of this prince is remarkable
for the uncommon length of his reign, and its many vicissitudes,
embracing a period of 65 years, and being closely connected with all the
great events of Europe during the last half century. He was born 1751,
and came to the throne at the age of eight. The first thirty years of
his reign were attended with peace and happiness; but in 1798 the
country was invaded by Bonaparte, before whom Ferdinand fled to Sicily:
and afterwards in 1820 the Carbonari effected a revolution which again
banished the royal family. The interposition of the Austrians, however,
restored the ancient order of things, which continued till the death of
the king, four years after.

1827. JAMES CHAMBERS, an eccentric poet, died in misery at a farm-house
in Stratbroke, England. From the age of 16 to 70 he wandered about the
country, gaining a precarious subsistence by selling his own effusions,
of which he had a number printed in a cheap form. His compositions were
mostly suggested to him by his muse, during the stillness of the night
while reposing in some friendly barn or hay-loft. When so inspired, he
would arise and commit the effusion to paper. He continued through life
in hopeless poverty, and was a lonely man and a wanderer, who had
neither act nor part in the common ways of the world.

aged 65.


JANUARY 5.

62. B. C. LUCIUS SERGIUS CATILINE, the Roman conspirator, killed in
Etruria. The history of his life unfolds a series of most revolting
crimes; but there is reason to believe that some of them are unreal.
Murder, rapine and conflagration, were the first pleasures of his life.
Pompey, Crassus and Caesar favored his schemes with a view to their own
aggrandizement. Only two Romans remained determined to uphold their
falling country--Cato and Cicero. The speeches of the latter in the
Roman senate on the crisis of affairs are imperishable monuments of
eloquence and patriotism, and produced the overthrow of the
conspirators. Five of them were put to death, and Catiline being
surrounded by the army under Petreius resolved to die sword in hand. The
battle was fought with desperation, and the insurgents fell, with their
leader at their head.

1066. EDWARD the Confessor, king of England, died. He was called to the
throne 1041. He was not the immediate heir, but his claim was supported
of Godwin, earl of Kent, whose daughter Editha he married. He was a weak
and superstitious prince, and acquired the title of _Saint_ or
_Confessor_, by abstaining from nuptial connection with his queen. He
was the first English monarch who undertook to cure the _king's-evil_ by
touching the patient. With him ended the Saxon line of kings.

1477. CHARLES the Bold, duke of Burgundy, killed in battle on this or
the following day. This prince, the son of Philip the Good and Isabella
of Portugal, early displayed a violent, impetuous and ambitious
disposition; and in after life was constantly embroiled in unjust and
cruel warfare, in which he performed many daring exploits. But having
turned his arms against the Swiss, the fortune of war turned against
him; and being deserted by his allies, with his usual temerity risked a
battle with only 4000 men against a vastly superior force, was defeated
and killed by the thrust of a lance in the 44th year of his age. His
body covered with blood and mire, and his head imbedded in the ice, was
not found till two days after the battle, when it was so disfigured that
his own brother did not recognize it. With him expired the feudal
government of Burgundy.

1531. The electoral college assembled at Rome and elected Ferdinand,
brother of Charles V, king of the Romans. He was crowned a few days
after at Aix-la-Chapelle.

1536. CATHARINE OF ARRAGON, the repudiated queen of Henry VIII, died.
She was the youngest daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella, born 1483. She
was first married to Arthur, prince of Wales, who died five months
after; and the king unwilling to return her dowry caused her to be
contracted to his remaining son, Henry. The prince, at the age of 15,
made a public protest against this proceeding, but finally consented to
the match. Notwithstanding the inequality of their ages and the
capricious disposition of the king, they had been married 20 years when
the division took place. This separation led to a divorce from the pope
also, and was the cause of mighty effects.

1559. CATHARINE DE MEDICIS died. She was born at Florence 1519; married,
1533, the dauphin, afterwards Henry II, of France. She was three times
regent of France, and during her administration made a conspicuous
figure in the annals of Europe by her political genius. By her was begun
the palace of the Tuilleries; but the lasting monument of her fame and
iniquity is the massacre of St. Bartholomew's, which was brought about
by her intrigues, when more than 50,000 protestants were massacred in
one day.

1621. PAUL VAN SOMER died in London. He was born at Antwerp, 1576, and
arrived at great proficiency as a painter. His pencil was chiefly
employed on portraits of royal and eminent personages, and is said to
have equalled Vandyke.

1636. DE VRIES, who had recently arrived from Holland in the capacity of
a patroon, sent his colonists over to Staten island from fort Amsterdam,
to commence the colony and buildings.

Almerchiga, a league from Icore. It closed on the 13th of the same
month.

1722. BELL, the Traveler, arrived at Moscow on the return from China.
(See July 14, 1719.) The account of this journey, and of what he saw and
learned at Pekin, is the most valuable part of his book, and one of the
best and most interesting relations ever written by any traveler.

1724. CZARTAN PETRARCH died, aged 184, at a village near Temeswar, in
Hungary. He was born in the year 1539; and at the time the Turks took
Temeswar from the Christians he was employed in keeping his father's
cattle. A few days before his death he had walked with the help of a
stick to the post house to ask charity of the travelers. His hair and
beard were of a greenish-white color, like mouldy bread; and he had a
few of his teeth remaining, and enjoyed a little eyesight. His son, who
was ninety-seven years of age, declared that his father had married at
an extreme age, for the third time, and that he was born in this last
marriage. He had descendants in the fifth generation, with whom he
sometimes sported, carrying them in his arms. His son, though
ninety-seven, was still fresh and vigorous. The commandant of Temeswar
on learning of his sickness, caused his portrait to be painted, and it
was nearly finished when he expired.

1757. DAMIENS attempted the assassination of Louis XV, for which he was
condemned to the most cruel tortures, and finally quartered by four
horses. (See March 28.)

1795. The British ships Bellona and Alarm captured the French ship Le
Dumas of 20 guns, off Deseada.

1796. SAMUEL HUNTINGTON, one of the signers of the Declaration of
Independence, died. He was born at Windham, Ct., 1732; his father being
a farmer could allow him only a common school education; but his own
assiduity made up the deficiency, so that at the age of 22 he commenced
the study of the law with borrowed books; in 1764 he was sent to the
general assembly; 1765 appointed king's attorney; 1774 raised to the
bench of the supreme court; 1775 sent a delegate to the general congress
of the colonies, and in 1779 succeeded John Jay as president of
congress. At the time of his death he was governor of Connecticut.

a duel, firing his pistol in the air; 1791 married the eldest daughter

Flanders at the head of the British army, and in the end showed himself

commons for the follies committed in the army through the influence of a

1540. HENRY VIII married Anne, daughter of John, duke of Cleves. This
was his fourth wife. He had asked her hand in marriage after having seen
a portrait of her by Holbein; and becoming disgusted with her in six
months bestowed upon her the epithet of _Flanders mare_, and sent her
home. She retired, not much disconcerted, to her own country, where she

with a golden hammer the _holy gates_ of the four great churches which

1734. JOHN DENNIS, an English dramatist and critic, died. He was the son
of a saddler, born in London 1657, and liberally educated. His first
play appeared in 1697, and was followed by many dramatic pieces and
poems which were sufficiently worthless to procure their author an
imperishable notoriety in the _Dunciad_, where Pope has gibbeted him. He
squandered a fortune which had been left him by an uncle, and not being
able to subsist by his pamphlets and criticisms for the magazines,
depended upon his friends for a living; and even those whom he had made
his enemies joined in the benefit for him at the Haymarket theatre,
after he had become blind and partially insane. One of his plays, which
was condemned, is famous for a new kind of thunder introduced in it; a
few nights after its representation, the players made use of the
contrivance in Macbeth, when the author rose in the pit and with an oath
claimed it as his thunder. His _thunder_ is said to be that still used
in the theatres.

1738. JEAN BAPTIST LABAT, a missionary and traveler, died. He was born
at Paris 1663, and became a Dominican priest in Norway, where he taught
mathematics and philosophy also. In 1693 he embarked for Martinique as a
missionary; and during several voyages in service of the mission,
visited all the Antilles. When the English attacked the island of
Guadaloupe, he rendered his country important services as an engineer.
He afterwards traveled much in Europe, and published his travels. His
voyage to the West Indies has been translated into several languages,
and is a truly scientific work.

first sermon at the age of 15; and he was distinguished for learning and
piety. The celebrated romance, _Telemaque_, was published against his
will by the treachery of his servant, and involved him in difficulties
with the king, who considered it a satire upon his reign. During the
revolution of 1793 his coffin was dug up to furnish lead for bullets. In
1819 a monument was erected to his memory by public subscription, and in
1826 a statue by the sculptor David was placed at Cambray. The age in

miles.

1472. Birthday of COPERNICUS, at Thorn in Prussia.

1514. VASCO NUNEZ DE BALBOA returned to his colony at Darien, after
having made the discovery of the Pacific ocean. His expedition occupied
four months and a half; his triumph was complete. The whole population
poured down to the shore to meet him, to hail him as the author of their
fortunes, as less a man than a gift of heaven, to guide them into the
possession of glories and riches incalculable. The expedition had been
undertaken in consequence of the extravagant representations by the
Indians, of a people who lived on the borders of that ocean, six suns
distant, who owned large ships, and whose eating and drinking vessels
were of pure gold. They referred to the Peruvians.

printer, Wynkyn de Worde.

1547. HENRY HOWARD, earl of Surrey, a soldier, scholar and poet,
beheaded on Tower hill for treason. In his youth he made the tour of
Europe, and at Florence signalized his courage and romantic spirit, by
publishing, in the style of a knight-errant, a challenge to all comers,
Christians, Jews, Saracens, Turks and Cannibals, in defence of the
surpassing beauty of his mistress, the fair Geraldine; and was
victorious at the tournament instituted by the grand duke on the
occasion. He served in the army sent against Scotland in 1542, and in
1544 accompanied the troops with which the king invaded France. For his
services he was promoted, but being defeated in an attempt to seize a
convoy, he was superseded. This unmerited disgrace was the beginning of
his ruin. He is said to have aspired to the hand of the Princess Mary,
and on some frivolous charges was tried by a common jury, by whom he was
obsequiously found guilty of treason. Thus perished a man "no less
valiant than learned, and of excellent hopes," aged 27.

equal assiduity, to the age of 77, when he took an inventory of his
literary stock in trade. It consisted of 4200 songs, 508 comedies, and
other pieces, in all 6048, making 32 folio volumes written by his own

are distinguished for _naivete_, feeling, and striking description.

accomplished scholar and a good speaker, but declined all public
employment, being wholly engrossed in gallantry and pleasure. He was the
patron of poets and men of wit: his own productions are those of a man
of wit, vigorous, gay and airy. He served in the Dutch war of 1665 as a
volunteer, and on the night before an engagement, composed the
celebrated song, beginning, "To all you ladies now at hand."

1728. WILLIAM CONGREVE, the English dramatist, died. He was educated for
the bar, but like many others similarly situated, gave up the law for
the pursuit of polite literature, in which he was eminently successful.
His first work, _The Incognita_, was written at a very early age, and he
produced his first comedy at the age of 21.

died a pensioner at Naples of a relapse of the gout.

commons, though returned by large majorities.

minister of state, died, aged 74. It is said of him that during nearly
sixty years of warfare against different enemies, he never lost a
battle, and was never taken by surprise. He was undoubtedly the ablest
general of his age; had a proud mien, a noble aspect and a strong frame;
slept little, labored and wrote much. But pride, severity and cruelty
tarnished his renown, so that he became odious even to his own
countrymen.

1609. JOSEPH JUSTUS SCALIGER died, aged 69. His education commenced
early, and he was one of the most indefatigable students through a long
life, that was ever known. So entirely immersed was he in his studies,
that he passed whole days in his chamber without eating or drinking, and
paid very little attention to the common affairs of life. He may be
called the founder of the science of chronology.

and energetic sovereign that ruled over the Mogul empire of Hindostan.
From his 20th year, military duties devolved upon him; he raised a body
of troops, and obtained the government of the Deccan. He invited his old
friends the fakirs, or religious mendicants, to a feast, and compelled
them to put on new and decent clothing. The gold and silver pieces which
he found on burning their old garments, was of great service to him in
prosecuting the war against his elder brother for the sovereignty. He
stirred up dissensions among his brothers, by which they were put out of
his way, shut up his father in his harem, and in 1659 ascended the
throne. Notwithstanding his cruelty he governed with much wisdom, and
consulted the welfare of his people. Two of his sons endeavoring to form
a party in their own favor, he caused to be put to death by slow poison.
In the midst of his activity he died at Ahmednagar, and with his death
terminated the brilliant epoch of the Moguls.

1721. FRANCIS PAGI died, author of a chronological history of the popes.

1733. BERNARD DE MANDEVILLE, an English author, died. He was born at
Dort in Holland, and went to England to practice medicine. Meeting with
poor encouragement, he turned author; but his topics, though professedly
intended for the promotion of the public morals, introduced him to the
notice of the grand jury. His pen procured the means of subsistence, but
acquired for him an unenviable notoriety.

1750. JOHN BLAND, the renowned writing master, died at his academy in
London.

Advertiser_; and the last number was also published on this day, 1772.

1773. ALEXIS PIRON, a French dramatist, died. His first effusions were
satires, which procured him so many enemies that even in the latter part
of his life he could not get admission into the Academy. He revenged
himself by calling them _les invalides du bel esprit_, and composing his
own humorous epitaph:

     _Ci-git Piron, qui ne fut rien,
     Pas meme academicien._

1774. MUSTAPHA III, emperor of Turkey, died, and was succeeded by his

1793. LOUIS XVI beheaded at Paris, aged 38. He had reigned 17 years and
7 months, and is now represented as an amiable and benevolent man,
anxious to make his subjects happy; who in turn treated him in the
vilest manner, and executed him as a tyrant and a traitor. His behavior
on many trying occasions vindicated him effectually of timidity, and
showed that the unwillingness to shed blood by which he was particularly
distinguished, arose from benevolence, and not from pusillanimity. Upon
the scaffold he exhibited a firmness that became a noble spirit.

1814. JACQUES BERNARDIN HENRY DE ST. PIERRE, a French philosophical
writer, died, at his estate near Paris. He is best known as the author
of _Paul and Virginia_, which appeared in 1788, and passed through fifty
editions in one year. It has been generally translated in Europe.

1815. MATTHIAS CLAUDIUS, a German poet, died. His prose and poetry are
said to bear a peculiar stamp of humor, frankness and cordiality, and
many of his songs, set to music by the first composers, have become a
part of the national melodies. He filled several public offices.

1816. Day of general mourning in France, on account of the death of
Louis XVI, twenty-three years after his execution.

naturalist, died. He came to America in the pursuit of science, and
while at Philadelphia learnt that he had been proscribed by the
revolutionists as an emigrant. He supported himself as a teacher of
music and languages until the arrival of the French minister, who
afforded Palisot the means of prosecuting inquiries into the natural
history of America. He was employed to arrange Peale's collection. On
returning to France with his rich collections, he was admitted into the
Institute, in the place of Adanson.

1824. CHARLES MACARTHY killed. He commanded at the Cape-Coast against
the Ashantees. Whilst making preparations to repel these savages in
1821, the king sent his compliments to him, and said he hoped to have
his head as an ornament to their great war drum. Subsequently Sir
Charles marched against the enemy with a mixed force of Europeans and
blacks; the latter ran away, and the whites being defeated and their
commander captured, the ferocious menace was realized. The trophy
however was afterwards recovered.

1839. Great conflagration at Constantinople, in which the grand vizier's
palace, called the Sublime Porte, including the ministerial and

1575. Queen ELIZABETH granted to Thomas Tallis and William Birde an
exclusive patent for printing music, for the term of twenty-one years.

1683. ANTHONY ASHLEY COOPER, first earl of Shaftsbury, died. The career
of this able, but dubious and versatile statesman was cast in a stormy
period, and his acts have been severely reprehended. Yet much of it is
to be attributed to the odium excited by opposing party feelings. His
vices appear to have been redeemed by corresponding virtues, and had he
appeared in a different age, it is likely he would have developed a
different character.

1689. The British parliament having met under the name of a convention,
declared that the king, James II, had abdicated the throne. William and
Mary succeeded him.

desperation six hours, when they surrendered. British loss, as stated by

have been greater. American loss, 200 killed, 522 prisoners, 27 escaped.

was an active contributer to knowledge of all kinds. He died of a slow
fever, caught by attending a poor family in a close apartment.

1822. JOHN JULIUS ANGERSTEIN died, celebrated as the founder of the
British national gallery, which was purchased by the government after
his death for L40,000, (_Cyclopedia Americana_ says L60,000) and was

in it till 1813, when he was honorably discharged, on account of his
disability, having suffered a stroke of paralysis.

1840. JOHN FREDERICK BLUMENBACH died at Goettingen, aged 88. He was long
a distinguished professor at the university, and a very eminent
naturalist. His collection of skulls was said to be the richest in the
world. The 50th year of his professorship was celebrated in 1826.

1849. JOHN C. CALHOUN'S draft of an address to the people of the United
States adopted in preference to Berrien's, and the Southern convention
adjourned sine die.

1854. PATRICK O'DONAHOE died at Brooklyn, N. Y.; one of the Irish exiles
who escaped from Van Diemen's Land.


JANUARY 23.

1401. TAMERLANE introduced his troops into the city of Damascus, in
violation of a truce; and after levying an enormous contribution in
gold, massacred the inhabitants, and reduced the city to ashes, in
revenge of the murder of the grandson of Mahomet, seven centuries
before, by the Syrians.

1516. FERDINAND V of Spain died. He inherited the crowns of Aragon and
Sicily, and united to them the kingdom of Castile by marriage. In 1492
he added to these the kingdom of Granada, the last possession of the
Moors, by conquest; at the same time Columbus was discovering for him
the new world. By force and treachery he acquired the kingdom of Naples,
and by similar means Navarre was also added to his dominions. Thus the
whole of Spain was united under him; so that he may be considered as the
restorer if not the founder of the Spanish monarchy. He was the most
powerful monarch of his time; but his conduct was characterized by a
total want of faith, and a recklessness of principle of which he made no
scruple of boasting. He was the founder of that fearful tribunal, the
Inquisition.

1570. Earl MURRAY, regent of Scotland, shot by Hamilton of
Bothwellhaugh. The latter, after the battle of Langside hill, had been
condemned to death as a rebel, and pardoned. A part of his estate,
however, was bestowed upon one of the regent's favorites, who seized
Hamilton's house and turned his wife out into the fields naked in a cold
night, by which she became deranged. This injury induced him to seek
revenge on the regent, after which he escaped to France.

1722. HENRI DE BOULAINVILLIERS, count of St. Saire in Normandy, died.
Having finished his studies he entered the army, which however, he soon
left to devote his attention to literature. A marked antipathy to
revelation pervades his writings, and exhibits itself in singular
contrast with a superstitious reverence for judicial astrology, and the
mystic sciences, which he cultivated with much diligence.

1733. O. S. Birthday of BENJAMIN LINCOLN, a revolutionary general, at
Hingham, Mass. Great reliance was placed in his abilities by Washington,
and many important commissions entrusted to him. In 1781 he was
appointed secretary of war, which office he held three years, and then
retired to his farm. He died 1810.

1761. Action between the British frigate Minerva, 22 guns, Capt. Hood,
and French ship Warwick, 34 guns, M. de Bellair, near cape Pinas, which
resulted in the capture of the latter. French loss 14 killed, 32
wounded; British loss 14 killed, 33 wounded, 3 of whom died.

1765. The British under Capt. Byron colonized the Falkland islands.

1766. WILLIAM CASLON, an eminent English type founder, died. He was
induced to attempt letter-cutting by a friend, and such was the
perfection to which he carried the art, that the beauty of his type
exceeded all others of the day, and was sought for from other countries
on the continent. He was employed to cut characters for several
languages of Asia.

1772. Mrs. CLUM died near Litchfield, England, aged 138. She had lived
103 years in one house.

1775. The Pennsylvania convention declared their determination, in case
the arbitrary laws of England were attempted to be executed by force, to
repel the same by the most determined resistance.

1780. The British ship Culloden of 74 guns lost off Long island.

1789. FRANCES BROOKE died, an English lady, remarkable for her literary
accomplishments. Her works consist of novels, periodicals, tragedies,
musical dramas, and translations.

1789. JOHN CLELAND died; author of the notoriously immoral romance,
_Fanny Hill_.

1790. The mutineers of the ship Bounty having arrived at Pitcairn's
island, and landed all their effects, set fire to the vessel and
destroyed every vestige that could lead to the discovery of their
retreat. The island was then divided into nine equal portions between
them, and the natives were reduced to the condition of slaves. (See Oct.
3.)

1795. JOHN SULLIVAN, a distinguished general in the revolutionary army,
died. He was of Irish descent, and before the revolution practiced law
in New Hampshire. He was among the first to take an active part in the
contest; resigned his seat in the first congress to enter the army; was
conspicuous at several engagements; and terminated his military career
in laying waste the country of the Six Nations, in order to put a stop
to their depredations. After the peace he filled several important state
offices.

1795. The French took possession of the Hague and Helvoetsluis, made 800
Englishmen prisoners, and liberated 600 Frenchmen.

1799. The French under Championnet entered Naples.

1800. A convention signed between Gen. Kleber and the grand vizier for
the evacuation of Egypt by the French troops.

1800. EDWARD RUTLEDGE, one of the signers of the Declaration of
Independence, died. He was a member of the first congress and acted a
conspicuous part during the war. While the British beleaguered
Charleston, his native city, he commanded a company of troops, and was
taken prisoner. On the restoration of peace he returned to the practice
of law, and a short time previous to his death was elected governor of
the state of South Carolina.

1802. HUMBOLDT and his companions ascended Chimborazo to the height of
18,576 feet above the surface of the sea. The blood started from their
eyes, lips and gums, and they became almost torpid with cold. A narrow
deep valley prevented them from reaching the summit, which was 1344 feet
higher.

1806. WILLIAM PITT, second son of the earl of Chatham, died. He was born
1759, and at the age of 23 became chancellor of the exchequer and the
next year prime minister. It was during the early part of his career
that the American war was concluded. Notwithstanding the emoluments of
his offices were great, so far from acquiring wealth, he died involved.
Parliament decreed him a public funeral, and L40,000 to pay his debts.

1813. GEORGE CLYMER, one of the signers of the Declaration of
Independence, died. By the death of his parents he was left an orphan at
the age of 7 years; but he was taken care of by his uncle, who left him
a large fortune, with which to continue the business of a merchant in
Philadelphia. His services to the country during the revolution, in
raising supplies and devising ways and means to continue the struggle,
were of incalculable importance.

1813. Horrible massacre of the United States prisoners taken by the
British and Indians at the battle of Frenchtown the day before. The
houses in which the helpless wounded lay were set on fire, and those who
were too feeble to continue the march were shot or tomahawked on the
road. It is morally certain that the British generals Proctor and
Elliott were culpable for this wanton sacrifice of human life to satiate
the revenge of the savages.

1813. ROBERT JAMISON died in South Carolina, aged 104. His eyesight,
which had failed him some years previous to his decease, returned again
just before his death in all its strength.

1815. Thanksgiving day in New Orleans, and a solemn _Te Deum_ on account
of Jackson's victory.

1820. EDWARD, duke of Kent, died. He was the fourth son of George III.
In 1802 he was appointed governor of Gibraltar, but his rigid discipline
produced a mutiny, and he was recalled. The present queen of England is
his daughter.

1824. STEPHEN ACOUR KOVER, an Armenian writer of distinction, died, aged
84.

1833. BANASTRE TARLETON died, aged 78. He commanded the British cavalry
in the Carolinas, in the revolution.

1841. SARAH ANN DAVIS sentenced at Philadelphia for murder; the first
capital conviction of a female in Philadelphia.

1844. WILLIAM GASTON died at Raleigh, the capital of his native state.
The prudence and energy of his mother made a disposition, naturally
volatile and irritable, become a pattern of patience and perseverance.
His speeches when a member of congress were highly finished.

1853. JUNIUS SMITH died, aged 74; having devoted a considerable portion
of his life to the establishment of transatlantic steam-navigation, and
the naturalization of the teaplant in the United States.

1854. ALEXANDER DE BODISCO died at Georgetown. He was seventeen years
Russian minister at Washington, and was very popular with the American
people.

1855. There was an earthquake in a part of New Zealand, by which the
surface of the earth was raised between three and four feet, and the
shellfish attached to the rocks died.


JANUARY 24.

41. CAIUS CALIGULA, the Roman emperor, assassinated. He commenced his
reign with every promise of becoming a good monarch. But at the end of
eight months he was attacked with a fever, which appears to have left a
frenzy upon his mind, for his disposition was totally reversed. After
committing the most atrocious acts of cruelty and folly, he was
assassinated by a tribune as he came out of the amphitheatre, in the
29th year of his age, and the 4th of his reign.

76. Birthday of PUBLIUS AELIUS ADRIAN, the Roman emperor. He was a
renowned general and great traveler; who, on a visit to Britain, built
the famous wall or rampart, which still retains his name, extending from
the mouth of the Tyne to the Solway frith, 80 miles, to prevent the
incursions of the Caledonians into England.

1559. CHRISTIAN II, king of Denmark, died. His history affords a series
of cruelties and usurpations almost without a parallel, from 1515, when
he ascended the throne, until 1523, when he was deposed. The remainder
of his life was passed in imprisonment.

1709. GEORGE ROOKE, an English admiral, died. He took the fortress of
Gibraltar, by surprise, 1704; since which it has continued in the hands
of the British, and is considered impregnable.

1712. Birthday of FREDERICK the Great of Prussia.

1727. PHILIP DE VENDOME, a French general, died. He distinguished
himself in the army of Louis XIV.

Ireland, born in the reign of Queen Anne, and had seen four monarchs on
the English throne. He took an early and active part in the
revolutionary war; and was possessed of a most remarkable degree of
activity, both of body and mind, until the morning he expired.

1834. WILLIAM DONNISON, an officer of the revolution, died. He was
appointed adjutant and inspector-general of the Massachusetts militia by
Gov. Hancock in 1788, which office he held until 1813.

1838. JOSEPH GOUGE, a revolutionary soldier, died, aged 109.

life one of the first owners of the land on which Cincinnati now stands,

in the line of opera.

dictionary, and a Japanese and English vocabulary.


JANUARY 25.

275. LUCIUS DOMITIUS AURELIANUS, emperor of Rome, assassinated. He was
the son of a peasant; his mother a priestess of the Temple of the Sun.
He enlisted as a common soldier, and rose from that humble station to
the highest military offices during the reigns of Valerian and Claudius,
the latter of whom, on his death bed, recommended Aurelian to the choice
of the troops. He delivered Italy from the barbarians, and conquered the
famous Zenobia queen of Palmyra. He had planned an expedition against
Persia, and was waiting in Thrace for an opportunity to cross the
straits when he fell a victim to a conspiracy.

1327. EDWARD II of England, then a prisoner in Kenilworth castle,
compelled to resign his crown in favor of his son, Edward III.

1533. HENRY VIII privately married to Ann Boleyn in a garret at
Whitehall.

Hood. The French were drawn from their anchorage ground, and by a
masterly manoeuvre the British succeeded in obtaining it.

1786. CHARLES PRICE, one of the most successful counterfeiters ever
known, committed suicide in prison, London. He had continued to practice
forgeries on the Bank of England to an incredible amount during six
years, contriving all the while to elude the most cunning devices of the
police to detect him, although the notes were traced in every quarter to
have proceeded from one man, always disguised and always inaccessible.

vicinity to such a degree as to excite considerable alarm.

1843. EDWARD DRUMMUND, private secretary to Sir Robert Peel, was
assassinated in the streets of London. For nearly 20 years he discharged
duties second to those of a cabinet minister, because less conspicuous.

JANUARY 26.

477. Subterranean thunders were heard simultaneously from the Black to
the Red sea, and the earth was convulsed without intermission for the
space of six months after. In many places the air seemed to be on fire.
Towns and large tracts of ground were swallowed up in Phrygia, during
this convulsion, the particulars of which would seem incredible, were
they not corroborated by contemporary historians.

1564. The pope confirmed by a bull the decrees of the Council of Trent.

1630. HENRY BRIGGS, an English mathematician, died.

1679. Keel of the Griffin, the first vessel in the western waters, laid
6 miles west of Niagara falls, by La Salle.

1679. The invaluable library of Elias Ashmole destroyed by fire at his

wounded. British loss trifling.

1787. The assembly of notables met at Paris, having been called together
to assist the king, Louis XVI, and M. Calonne, to raise a revenue to
meet the exigencies of the times. M. Calonne presented his new plan of
reform and taxation, imposing a share of the burden upon the privileged
classes: but as the assembly was composed of these classes they could
not make up their minds to impose taxes upon themselves which had
hitherto been borne by the lower classes. The assembly was called to
help the king and his minister out of a dilemma, but plunged them deeper
in trouble, and accelerated the revolution.

1820. HENRY ANDREWS, a self-taught English mathematician, died. For more
than forty years he produced an almanac for a company of stationers
under the name of Francis Moore, physician, and astonished the simple
and ignorant by his marvelous predictions. His prophecies were as much
laughed at by himself as by the worshipful company of stationers for
whom he annually manufactured them in order to render their almanacs
salable among the ignorant, with whom a lucky hit covered a multitude of
blunders. A few years before his death he predicted that the people
would soon know better than to be influenced by the prophecies which his
employers required him to write. He did not live to see the publication
of the _British Almanac_, which effected the downfall of _Poor Robin_
(the title of one of his almanacs), which ceased to exist in 1828.

1823. EDWARD JENNER died, aged 74, celebrated for having introduced the
practice of vaccination as a preventative of the small pox. He was the
youngest son of a clergyman, born in England 1749. He commenced his
investigations concerning the cow pox about the year 1776, and twenty
years afterwards the practice was introduced into London hospitals. The
success of this discovery procured him honorary titles, and a grant from
parliament of L20,000.

1838. JOHN O'NEIL died at Havre de Grace, Md., distinguished for the
resistance which he made at that place, to the British under admiral
Cockburn, during the last war.

1839. STEPHEN VAN RENSSELAER died at Albany. He was born in the city of
New York 1764, and graduated at Cambridge, Mass. He was the fifth in
descent from Kilian Van Rensselaer, the original proprietor and patentee
of the colony of Rensselaerwyck, a territory 48 miles long and 24 broad.
He filled several offices, civil and military; was a man of great
wealth, and distinguished for his magnificent charities and Christian
virtues.

island, drove off from one of the inhabitants of Warwick, 15 horses, 50
oxen and 200 sheep.

1696. The Royal Sovereign burnt by accident. She was the first great
ship built in England, and became one of the best men of war in the
world. For sixty years she was so formidable to her enemies that none of
the most daring of them willingly ventured an engagement. The levies of
money for building this noble vessel caused the rebellion.

1733. THOMAS WOOLSTON, an English divine, died in prison. He imbibed a
fondness for allegorical interpretations of scripture from reading some
of the early writers--particularly Origen. His speculations finally led
to an indictment for blasphemy, and being unable to pay the fine
imposed, he was retained in prison. He was a learned man, but held
notions peculiar to himself, which was a high offence in those days.

1760. The ice carried away one of the dykes of the Rhine, in consequence
of which the neighboring country was inundated.

1783. The British under Gen. Mathews took possession of Bednapore and
Candapore, without firing a gun, and the whole country, except
Mangalore, yielded in consequence.

1795. PICHEGRU made a requisition upon the Dutch for the French army of
200,000 quintals of corn, 5,000,000 rations of hay, 5,000,000 measures
of oats, 200,000 rations of straw, 150,000 pairs of shoes, 20,000 pairs
of boots, 20,000 cloth coats and waistcoats, 40,000 pairs of stocking
breeches, 150,000 pairs of linen pants, 200,000 shirts, 50,000 hats, to
be furnished within a month, and 12,000 oxen to be furnished within two
months.

1800. King John's castle, at Old Ford near Bow, in England, was blown

valuable cargo.

1814. Camp Defiance attacked by the Indians at day break. The United
States troops and friendly Indians were commanded by Gen. Floyd, who
repulsed the assailants with great slaughter.

1823. CHARLES HUTTON, an eminent English mathematician, died. He was
born 1737; his father, a viewer of mines, intended him for the same
employment; but he rose by his own energy and application to a high
degree of fame and fortune.

1832. AUGUSTIN DANIELS, count de Billiard, died, a French statesman and
soldier. He fought at Jemappes, was with Bonaparte through the Egyptian
campaign; at Austerlitz; in all the great battles in Prussia; at Moskwa;
and lost an arm at Leipsic. He made himself useful under Louis XVIII and
Louis Philippe.

1832. ANDREW BELL, founder of the Bell or Madras system of education,
died. It has been made a subject of dispute whether Bell or Lancaster is
the progenitor of the monitorial or mutual system of instruction. In
1796 Dr. Bell returned from Madras, and submitted his system to the
public. It has since been widely diffused over the civilized world.

1836. FREDERICK DAVID SCHAEFFER died, pastor of the German Lutheran
church in Philadelphia. He was born and educated in Germany, but came to
this country in early life. He was a man of learning, and distinguished
for his knowledge of languages.

1840. ISAAC CHAUNCEY, a distinguished American commodore, died at
Washington.

1841. MCLEOD arrested within the limits of the state of New York. Though
engaged in burning the steamboat Caroline in 1837, yet being a British
subject and that government having assumed the responsibility of that
act, his arrest threatened a rupture of the peace between the two
nations.

1850. WILLIAM ATKINS COLEMAN, for more than thirty years connected with
the literature of New York, died.

1856. CHARLES MORRIS, a commodore in the United States navy, died, aged

and in varied professional attainments; had displayed great heroism and
intrepidity in the capture of the Philadelphia and Guerriere; in the
latter action he was shot through the body by a musket ball.


JANUARY 28.

814. CHARLEMAGNE, or Charles I of France, died. He was an illustrious
sovereign, as well in the cabinet as in the field; and though he could
not write his name, was the patron of men of letters and the restorer of
learning. He wanted the virtue of humanity.

1547. HENRY VIII of England having grown so unwieldy and corpulent that
he was raised up and let down the stairs by a machine, after an illness
of some weeks, sank under his disease, and died in the 38th year of his
reign, and the 56th of his age. He repudiated his first wife 20 years
after marriage, and in the course of about ten years espoused five
others. Henry's reign was one of the most remarkable in the annals of
the kingdom. He made himself so much feared, that no English king had

snapped the chain which bound the nation to papacy, and have resisted
successfully the power and influence of the pope.

escape from the barbarity of her husband she retired to a convent, and
afterwards went to France. On the death of Charles, 1788, she returned
to Italy. She was then secretly married to Alfieri, the poet; the French
court conferred on her an annuity of 60,000 livres. Alfieri confesses

spirit with the effeminacy of a luxurious life. Instances of his
prodigious strength are recorded, which appear almost incredible.

study at the academy's expense. From Italy he repaired to Russia, where
he stayed two years; but not meeting with any adequate encouragement, he
returned to his own country. A colossal statue of Achilles mourning the

1834. LORENZO DOW died, aged 57; an eccentric traveling preacher. He was
born in Connecticut and had a good elementary education; but in his
youth acquired vicious habits which however he overcame at about the age
of 14. At an early age he believed himself called to preach, and in
obeying the impulse he commenced a career which has probably never been
equaled; and in spite of acute bodily disease performed an amount of
labor in traveling and preaching never before known. Before he had
completed his twenty-fifth year, he once rode 1500 miles and held 184
meetings in ten weeks and two days; and about a year afterwards,
traveled 4000 miles in the southern states, constantly preaching, in
seven months, and finished his tour without stockings, shoes, or outer
garment, and almost without a horse. For several years after he traveled
from seven to ten thousand miles and held six or seven hundred meetings
annually. It is thought that during the thirty-eight years of his public
life he must have traveled two hundred thousand miles, including three
voyages to England and Ireland. During these flying journeys he
constantly refused donations and contributions, except for immediate
want; and his traveling expenses exceeded his receipts more than one
half, the first eighteen years. Afterwards, however, his books became a
source of profit to him, and finally he became the maker and vender of a
_family medicine!_ which was a matter of speculation purely. He was
twice married; his second wife survived him. He was familiar to every
body throughout the United States, for there were few places however
obscure which he had not visited.

Pennsylvania historical society, and more intimately acquainted with the

their cause was favored of heaven.

1781. St. Eustatia, one of the West-India islands, taken by the British
under Rodney. The plunder amounted to above L3,000,000, besides 6 Dutch

deputation to the equator for scientific purposes. The very desire of
being connected with so perilous an undertaking made him an astronomer.
The fatigues and hardships which he encountered in South-America, were

was a soldier, and his first campaign was against Spartacus; afterwards
he led 1000 foot into Asia, where he was ridiculed for the small number
of his attendants, but was wholly unmoved by it. He sided with Cicero
against Catiline, and opposed Caesar in the senate on that occasion. He
endeavored to bring about a reconciliation between Caesar and Pompey, but
finding it in vain, sided with the latter. When Pompey was slain he fled
to Utica, and Caesar pursuing him, he advised his friends to be gone, and
his son to trust to Caesar's clemency; then lay down upon his bed, read
Plato on the immortality of the soul twice over, and rose and thrust

he ordered his coffin to be placed on a beam in the barn, with the key

strength of mind, which shrank from no danger or crime, united to great

Politiques des Papes_, and the old man was ordered in the middle of

to the persecutions of the 19th century, a few days after his arrival in
Madrid.

the royal title. In 1660 he entered London amidst the universal
acclamations of the people. He was a confirmed sensualist and
voluptuary, says Lardner, and owing to the example of him and his court,
his reign was the era of the most dissolute manners that ever prevailed

of 55. It was during this reign that the great plague and the great fire
of London occurred. He was the twenty-sixth king of England.

Napoleon he lost his titles and offices, but was in a measure
indemnified by the articles of Fontainbleau, the congress of Vienna, and

1630. The first day of public thanksgiving in Massachusetts. The day
had been appointed, for a general fast. No ship had arrived in a great
length of time, and their stock of provisions was nearly exhausted. At
this critical moment a vessel arrived from England laden with
provisions; and they immediately changed the day of public fasting into
one of public feasting. And it is quite probable that the day was
observed with something more than an outward show of thanksgiving on
that occasion.

at Oxford to the number of 44 lords and 118 commoners; the session was

1674. JEAN CHAPELAIN, died. He attracted the notice of Cardinal
Richelieu by a preface which he wrote for the _Adonis_ of Marini.
Chapelain was talented and learned, obsequious and discreet, and these
made his fortune, for he could be of service to the cardinal, who had
the weakness to set up for a _bel esprit_. He became one of the first
members of the _Academie Francaise_, received a large pension, and
became the oracle of the poets of the time, and was universally
esteemed. It would have been better if he himself had not set up for a
poet. In 1630 he commenced an epic, _La Pucelle_. It was announced
twenty years before its appearance, and the public expectation was
greatly disappointed; it soon became an object of ridicule.

became one of the most intrepid and daring chiefs of the royal army of

Ensign Daniel Fisher, and other English at Dedham, their associates and
successors," by Chauk alias Chague, the sachem of Pocomptuck, and his
brother Wassahoale, and witnessed by Wequonnock. It reserves to the
Indians the right of fishing in the rivers, hunting wild animals, and
gathering nuts. It is capable of proof, that the early settlers in New
England, as well as New York, made it a matter of course to purchase the
lands upon which they settled, in nearly all instances, and at prices
which were considered a fair equivalent at the time by the Indians. It
may be mentioned as a matter of curiosity, that the salary of the first
minister settled at this place was L60, to be paid in wheat at 3s. 6d.,

loss of Lancaster, a short time previous, had put the neighboring towns
on their guard, and Medfield had obtained a small garrison of soldiers
for greater security, although within 22 miles of Boston. The Indians
during the night had secreted themselves, according to custom, under the
fences and behind trees about the villages, so that the people were shot
down as they came out of their doors and their houses immediately set on
fire. The soldiers being lodged in different parts of the town, could
not get together until about 50 buildings were on fire. Some were killed
as they attempted to pass to their neighbors for shelter, and in some
instances, the husband flying with one child and the wife with another,
one of them fell into the hands of the savages or was killed, while the
other escaped. Two or three discharges of a field piece put the whole
horde to flight, who as they passed the river fired the bridge to

left a fortune of L5,000,000.

vessel afloat till the prisoners could be got off, but she sunk carrying
down 13 of her crew and 3 Americans. The loss of the crew of the Peacock
could not be ascertained; but the captain was killed in the latter part
of the engagement, and the vessel was literally cut to pieces. The
Hornet lost 1 killed and 4 wounded; and the vessel received trifling
damage, except in her rigging.

presented to the world the phenomenon of the steam boat.

1821. JOHN KEATS, an English poet, died, aged 25. He was of humble
origin, but was possessed of a fine genius. His productions were made

pages of the _Quarterly Review_. These gross attacks preyed upon his
mind and hastened his death.

the subject of four tragedies.

1676. The Indiana assaulted the town of Weymouth, Mass., and burned

consisted of fifteen members, who from the strictness of their manners

Germany, and on his return commenced the systematic labors by which he
became the founder of a numerous religious sect. He joined with

education while abroad.

distant of all the known planets, its revolution round the sun occupying

1262. HUGO DE ST. CARO, a Dominican, died. He deserves to be placed in
the first rank of sacred critics and patrons of literature. The
Dominicans are indebted to him for their celebrated _Correctorium
Bibliorium_, and the first concordance of the Bible, that is of the
Latin Vulgate; a comment on the old and new testament, and for the
division of the Bible into chapters. He undertook to procure a union of
the Greek and Roman churches.

Tabasco on the day of his landing in the country of Mexico, now marched
out with his troops to a plain, where he was attacked by an immense body

woods and marshes, leaving the field to the Spaniards.

1640. MANASSES DE PAS died; a French general, distinguished for his

at that time quartered in the town, the enemy were speedily repulsed

other distinctions, and acquired celebrity by his dramatic pieces, which
possess great merit.

1757. JOHN BYNG shot at Portsmouth. He served under his father admiral
George Byng, and rose to the same rank himself. His attempt to relieve
Fort St. Philip in Minorca proving abortive, when blockaded by a French
fleet under La Glassionere, and his hesitation in engaging the enemy
when a bold attack might perhaps have gained him the victory, excited
the clamor of the nation against him, and he was doomed to meet the
penalty of cowardice.

1758. GENERAL WADE died. In 1715, he commanded against the forces of the
pretender to the throne, and remained in Scotland as commander-in-chief
after the war was ended. It was during this period that he cut the
celebrated military road through the highlands, which facilitated the

resorted to before the reign of George I. It was he who introduced the
bill into parliament which disarmed and changed the dress of the
highlanders.

studied theology at Jena, where he commenced in solitude the first canto
of _The Messiah_. This work he finished about 1790. It procured him
great celebrity in the north of Europe, so that he was received with
great respect and veneration wherever he went. His funeral was attended
by the principal men of Hamburg, in 126 carriages.

senate house. He perished at 5 o'clock in the afternoon by 23 wounds. As
a _soldier_, he was unquestionably the greatest except one in the
history of mankind; his character as a _citizen_ is variously stated by
different factions. He is said to have fought 500 battles, conquered 300
nations, taken 800 cities, defeated 3,000,000 men, and slain 1,000,000
on the field of battle.

Alexander II, at the age of eight years. An enterprising and virtuous
ruler; he introduced many good regulations of government, and under his
sway the country seems to have enjoyed a tranquility to which she had
long been a stranger. As he was riding in a dark night between
Bruntisland and Ringhorn, on the banks of the frith of Forth, he was
thrown with his horse over a precipice and killed on the spot.

there was no one to dispute their possession.

Reynolds.

1810. On a pane of glass at an inn near London, under this date, is the
following inscription. "Thomas Mount Jones dined here, ate six pounds
bacon, and drank nineteen pots beer." It is a question for discussion,
whether in this frail memorial, the love of distinction and desire for
fame were not as great as the love of brutal gluttony.

1813. Captain BERRESFORD of the British ship Poictiers, 74 guns,
demanded of the inhabitants of Lewistown, Delaware, 25 oxen and
vegetables and hay, otherwise he threatened to destroy the town. The

laborious employment through life for the support of his family, yet by
his extraordinary genius and economy of time, he made great acquisitions
in learning and science, gained most of the languages, and made himself
the most eminent mathematician and astronomer that America has produced.
He published the _Practical Navigator_, a standard book; but the great
work on which his fame will rest, is the copious and profound commentary
upon the _Mechanique Celeste_ of La Place, of which he made the first
entire translation, and published at his own expense in 4 vols. quarto;
saying that he preferred spending a thousand dollars a year in that way
to keeping a carriage.

persecution. He wrote commentaries on some of the books of the old and
new testament.

1632. Treaty of St. Germain, by which Canada and Nova Scotia were
restored to the French. The capture of Quebec was unknown at the time
peace was re-established, or perhaps those territories would not have
been so generally given up.

1634. THOMAS RANDOLPH, an English poet, died. He was the friend of
Jonson, and his works have been several times reprinted.

1640. PHILIP MASSINGER, an English dramatic poet, died. Some of his

States.

1776. Boston evacuated by the British. By four in the morning the king's

embarked, General Washington marched into the city, where he was
joyfully received as a deliverer. The British left 250 cannon and 25,000
bushels of wheat.

1781. JOHANNES EVALD died: the most distinguished poetical genius of
Denmark, in the eighteenth century. Being left to his own reading by his
tutor, his imagination was captivated with _Tom Jones_ and _Robinson
Crusoe_. Proposing to himself the latter hero for a model, he eloped at
the age of thirteen with a view of proceeding to Batavia, but was
overtaken, and his project frustrated. He next conceived the scheme of
entering the Prussian army, and enlisted at Magdeburg; but being
received only as a foot soldier, instead of a hussar, he deserted to the
Austrians. On quitting the army he devoted himself to the study of
theology, but having suddenly become violently enamored with a young
lady, who regardless of his passion, bestowed her hand on another, a
permanent melancholy settled upon his mind, and under this influence he
took up his pen. His first work _Fortune's Temple_, a vision, at once
stamped his reputation. In 1772 he executed his literary
chef-d'oeuvre, _Balder's Doed_, a drama of extraordinary poetical
beauty, and greatly superior to anything which had then appeared in the
Danish language. His after life was embittered by poverty and sickness;
and it was under the hospitable roof of Madame Skou that he breathed his
last, after having been confined to his bed or armchair two years, and
almost deprived of the use of his limbs.

1782. DANIEL BERNOUILLI, a German philosopher, died. He studied medicine
as a profession, but was at the same time engaged with mathematics. At
the age of twenty-four, he was offered the presidency of an academy at
Genoa, but gave the preference to an invitation from St. Petersburgh. He
returned to Basle in 1733, where he spent the remainder of his days, so
much respected by the inhabitants, that to bow to Daniel Bernouilli,
when met in the street, was one of the first lessons which every father
gave his children.

1790. The government of France issued assignats to the amount of
170,000,000 francs. This system of assignats, while it gave more
strength to the public, yet was the source of more private suffering
than any other measure during the French revolution.

1793. Battle of Neerwinden, or Linden, between the French under
Dumourier, and the Austrians under Coburg and Clarifayt. Dumourier was
obliged to retreat.

1794. French sloop Avenger, 16 guns, taken by Admiral Jervis's squadron
off Martinique.

1795. A number of the Parisians complained to the national convention of
the _scarcity of bread_ in Paris.

1798. THOMAS JACKSON, an English actor, died. His epitaph is ingenious:
"Sacred to the memory of Thomas Jackson, comedian, who was engaged 21st
December, 1741, _to play a comic cast of characters_ in the great
theatre, the world; for many of which he was _prompted_ by nature to
excel. The _season_ being ended, his _benefit_ over, the charges all
paid, his account closed, he made his _exit_ in the _tragedy of Death_
on the 17th of March, 1798, in assurance of being called once more to
_rehearsal_, where he hopes to find his _forfeits_ all cleared, his

finally resulted in the defeat of the house, and the practice of those
publications ever since. He was a warm opponent of the American war, and
was prosecuted for sedition, for the wording of a resolution by which
the Constitutional society voted L100 to the relief of the widows and
children of the Americans who fell at the battle of Lexington, and was

drank it young and perpetuated their youth. At a great loss of his men
in the swamps and marshes, he penetrated into the interior, but was
driven back by the Indians without discovering the miraculous fountain.

1556. THOMAS CRANMER, archbishop of Canterbury, burnt for heresy at
Oxford. He was born 1489, and educated for the ministry. His first
promotion arose from his remarking that the meditated divorce of Henry
VIII from his first wife, Catharine of Arragon, might be decided by
learned divines without an appeal to the pope. The king, on hearing of
it exclaimed "by G----d, the man has got the sow by the right ear!" He
was sent for to court, and immediately preferred. On the accession of
Mary, he was tried before commissioners, sent from Rome on charges of
blasphemy, perjury, incontinence and heresy, and sentenced to be
degraded and deprived of office, and finally burnt for the confessions

among the first of his acts were the discontinuance of the Persian war,
and the liberation of the Poles confined in Russia. But his conduct was

said to have been the inventor of bombs; while Strada in his account of
the wars of the Low Countries, attributes the invention a few days
before this siege to an inhabitant of the town of Venloo, and that the
people of the city, wishing to exhibit it in presence of the duke of
Cleves, discharged a bomb, which falling on one of the houses, set fire
to it, and three-fourths of the town were destroyed before the flames
could be extinguished.

of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn. On the death of Mary, 1558, she was
proclaimed queen, at the age of twenty-five, and held the sceptre
forty-five years with uncommon ability. Her reign was a period of great
prosperity for England. Her treatment of the queen of Scots can never be

government overbalance those weaknesses which few crowned heads are
devoid of.

promoters of the royal society.

was one of the most celebrated wits of his age, an eminent statesman,
political, epistolatory and miscellaneous writer. His _Letters_,

scholar; but the critical reader will find that they insidiously
inculcate the loosest principles.

1773. STEPHEN LEAKE, an ingenious writer on coins and heraldry, died at
Thorp, England.

1776. JOHN HARRISON, an eminent English mechanic, died. He was the son

year should commence on the first of January, and that eleven days, from
the 2d to the 14th September, 1752, should be omitted, so that the 3d of
September should be dated the 14th. This occasioned great perplexity and
confusion of dates, arising from the computations by the old and new
styles.

distinguished for liveliness of imagination and delicacy of sentiment.

knighted by Queen Anne, and held several lucrative offices; but a want

Few of his pieces, although popular at the time, still keep the stage.

present use bears his sanction and authority.

last.

obtained from them by the Arabians, who employed it in a battle near
Mecca in 690. The use of gunpowder at the battles of Cressy and Poitiers

invented about the same time by divine inspiration, as a match for the
devil's suggestion of artillery.

train, Damiens stabbed him in the right side with a knife. He was
seized, tried and condemned to a death of torture. Being drawn on a
sledge to the Place de Greve, he there had the flesh of his thighs and

1794. J. B. V. GUILLOTINE was beheaded at Lyons. There is some mistake
about this event; the authority from which it is derived stating that he
was the inventor of the guillotine. (See March 20, and April 25, 1792;
also May 26, 1814.)

1794. JOHN ANTHONY NICHOLAS CARITAT, marquis de Condorcet, died. His
mathematical essays at an early age procured him a seat in the academy
of sciences, of which he was afterwards elected secretary. He published
the lives of several eminent men of his day, and was an active

the revolution, and failing to keep pace with the ultra views of the
Robespierre party, was proscribed, and died in prison either from want
or by his own hand.

the gradations, to the highest rank in the army; was appointed commander

and alchymist of his time. At the age of 30 he commenced the study of
theology for the purpose of converting infidels. He went over to Africa
to convert the Mohammedan doctors to Christianity, from whence he

to number the slain, returned that 28,000 were Lancastrians. The duke of
York, who won the day, made a triumphal entry into York, where he
ordered the death of several prisoners, while Henry who lost his crown,
escaped with difficulty to the borders.

1751. THOMAS CORAM, projector of the foundling hospital, died. He was
captain of a colonial trading vessel, and was prompted to this
charitable project, by frequently seeing children exposed in the streets
of London by the cruelty of their parents. He persevered in this humane
design 17 years, and at last obtained a charter by his sole application.

services, that in his old age he was dependent upon the charities of
others, when his principal benefactor was the prince of Wales.

1772. EMANUEL SWEDENBORG, founder of the New-Jerusalem church, died in

attention to heavenly things, and became equally celebrated for his
mystical reveries. His followers have multiplied in Europe and America
since his death.

1792. GUSTAVUS III, king of Sweden, died. He succeeded to the throne
1771. His reign was a turbulent one, in which all the arts and
stratagems to which he was obliged to resort, scarcely secured him in
power. He formed a plan for uniting Sweden, Russia, Prussia and Austria,
with himself at the head of the confederacy. While he was maturing his
plans, a plot was formed among his nobility for assassinating him. A
masquerade at Stockholm was chosen for the perpetration of the deed. He

lithographed pages, one devoted to oriental, the other to foreign

carried home with him and executed the idea of a newspaper--the most
efficient missionary for the spread of civilization and intelligence the
world has ever known.

1844. E. PENDLETON KENNEDY, of the United States navy and commander of
the battle ship Pennsylvania, died at Norfolk, Va.

1848. JOHN JACOB ASTOR, founder of the Astor library, died in New York,
aged 80. He was a native of Germany, and during a residence of nearly 60
years in America, amassed a fortune of about twenty millions of dollars.
He landed in this country with a trifling sum in his pocket, and early
commenced business as a trader in fur, and when the state of New York
was a wilderness, made frequent voyages up the Mohawk, to trade with the
Indians. As his wealth increased, he enlarged his business until by the
formation of the American Fur Company, he was a competitor with the
great capitalists of Europe, the proprietor of the North Western and
Canadian fur companies. Such was his enterprise, that he extended his
business to the mouth of the Columbia river and formed the first fur
establishment there, known as Astoria. Several expensive expeditions
were fitted out by him, of overland journeys, to the Pacific, some of
which were executed by individuals with great suffering. For many years
previous to the war of 1812, and subsequently, Mr. Astor was extensively
engaged in the Canton trade, and during the war was so fortunate that
several of his ships arrived here with valuable cargoes in safety. The
profits on those ships were enormous. Mr. Astor made large investments
in American stocks, which he purchased during the war with Great
Britain, at sixty to seventy cents on the dollar, and which after the
peace, went up to twenty per cent. above par. His great estate, however,

actions, conducted 53 sieges, assisted in repairing 300 ancient

fortifications, and he left 12 large volumes in manuscript, containing

circulation. He was afterwards elected sheriff, and received the honor
of knighthood.

1855. GEORGE BELLAS GREENOUGH, an English geologist, died, aged 77. He
was one of the founders of the Geological society, of London, and

attributes of each district between the plateaux north of the Himalaya
and cape Cormorin.

Kepler as one of the greatest men of the age. He is known as the
inventor of logarithms for the use of navigators.

practice to become an author.

1717. JAMES OZENHAM, an eminent French mathematician, died. He taught

his last days. His works are numerous and valuable.

under his direction, and he was wounded at Bunker Hill and Fort

397. AMBROSE, archbishop of Milan, died. He was famous for the zeal

several innocent persons to be put to death at Thessalonica. The _Te
Deum_ is attributed to him.

1284. ALPHONSO X, of Castile, died. He was elected emperor of Germany
1258, but neglecting to visit the empire, Rodolphus was chosen in his
place. He was dethroned by his own son, and compelled to seek protection
among the Saracens. His fame as an astronomer and a man of letters, is
greater than as a monarch. He is the first Castilian king who had the
public laws and the scriptures drawn in the vulgar tongue.

1581. DRAKE, the navigator, was knighted on board his famous ship, the
Pelican, at Deptford.

1588. FREDERICK II, of Denmark, died. He was a liberal and enlightened

1638. Massachusetts patent demanded. A quo warranto having been brought
by the attorney general of England against the governor and corporation
of Massachusetts, and judgment given that the liberties and franchises
should be seized into the king's hand, the council made an order
requiring that the charter should be returned by the next ship.
Arbitrary measures were pursued in reply to the petitions of the colony,
and 8 ships prepared to sail for New England were detained in the Thames
by order of the privy council. By this order, Oliver Cromwell, Arthur
Hazelrig, John Hambden and other malcontents, were forcibly prevented
from emigrating to America. How little did Charles anticipate that by
this high-handed measure he was detaining the very men who were destined
to overturn his throne, and terminate his career by a violent death.

1643. SIMON EPISCOPIUS, an able Dutch divine, died. He embraced the
doctrines of Arminius in relation to predestination, which exposed him
to much persecution and obloquy, and finally led to his banishment from
the commonwealth: he afterwards was permitted to return, and became
minister of the remonstrant church. His death happening at the moment of
an eclipse of the moon, was considered as an emblem of the departure of
the brightest ornament of the church.

proved to be more difficult than had been anticipated, and was not
completed till 1736.

1747. Number Four (Charlestown, N. H.) attacked by a large body of
French and Indians under M. Debeline, and gallantly defended by 30 men,
under major Stevens. The enemy kept up a brisk assault night and day;
when, on the third day, being in a starving condition, and finding it
impracticable to force or persuade a surrender, they retired and were
seen no more. This was considered one of the most chivalrous feats of
the time.

1764. MICHAEL LOMONOZOF, a Russian poet, died. From the occupation of a
fishmonger he rose to be the "father of Russian poetry," and a
philosopher of no mean pretensions. He published a history of the
Russian sovereigns, and an ancient history of Russia, from the origin of
the nation. His odes are greatly admired for the originality of
invention, sublimity of sentiment, and energy of language.

1769. HYDER ALLY, the adventurous East India chief, compelled the
English to form a treaty with him.

1770. JAMES PARSONS, an eminent English physician, died. He was the
correspondent of Buffon and other learned characters on the continent,
and an able writer on physic, anatomy, natural history, antiquities,
language, and the fine arts.

1774. OLIVER GOLDSMITH died, aged 46. He received a partial education at
Dublin college, after which he strayed from home, and making a tour on
the continent, afoot and alone, with a flute in his hand, fixed himself,
on his return, in London, as a _builder of books_. The details of his
life are interesting, chequered as they are with vicissitudes. As a
bookseller's hack he was particularly successful; but the liberality of
his disposition and want of economy, contributed to keep him in want,
and sometimes brought him to starvation. He died about L2,000 in debt.
His works, though most of them were produced on the spur of the moment,
to procure the necessaries of life, are still found in almost every
library.

1777. JOHN SWINTON, an English antiquary, died. His literary

the spot.

and they all voted for the king's death.

Jourdan lost upwards of 4,000 men, and fell back to the heights of
Villengen.

entrusted to him with distinguished integrity, and to him England is
indebted for much of that reform which has been introduced into the
practice of the law.

1807. JOSEPH JEROME LA FRANCAIS DE LALANDE died at Paris, aged 70. He
received a minute religious education, and displayed his abilities while
quite young by his sermons and mystical romances. His attention was
first drawn to astronomy by the remarkable comet of 1744; and he pursued
the study with so great success that he was sent to Berlin by the
academy at the age of 19, to make some observations on the moon's
parallax, when Frederick the Great could not conceal his astonishment at
the phenomenon of so young an astronomer. He became editor of the
_Connaissance des Temps_, published several works on astronomy, and
wrote all the astronomical articles for the great _Encyclopedie_. In
1778 he published a folio volume on canals, containing a general
history of all the ancient canals which had been previously undertaken,
accomplished and even projected. Although a sceptic, he is said to have
been "religious, in his own way."

I, in the name of the allies, recommended Bonaparte to choose a place of

Bonaparte's field marshals, died. He commanded in chief in the memorable
campaign in Switzerland; when at the battle of Zurich he had to contend
against the archduke Charles and prince Suwaroff; yet the fruits of this
campaign were 70,000 prisoners. He ended his military career in 1810, by
the command of the army of Portugal, where he was defeated by
Wellington.

1831. ISAIAH THOMAS, a distinguished American printer, died. He was born
in Boston, 1749, served an apprenticeship of 11 years, and commenced
business at a very early age at Newburyport. In 1770 he printed the
_Massachusetts Spy_ at Boston, where he annoyed the provincial officers
by the boldness and freedom of his articles on the difficulties that
agitated the country. He was also one of the most active and dexterous
of the skirmishers on the plains of Lexington. A few days after that
affair he removed his paper to Worcester; and gradually established
presses and book-stores in different parts of the Union, to the number
of twenty-four; so that he nearly supplied the entire country with
books. His Bibles, school books and almanacs, were in great repute for a
long time. He was the founder of the American antiquarian society, and
author of the _History of Printing in America_, a valuable work to the
profession and the antiquary.

347 B. C. PLATO, the Athenian philosopher, died. He was the pupil of
Socrates, and on the death of his master went into foreign countries in

opinions of his contemporaries by whom his talents and learning were
highly appreciated.

33. The day of our Savior's resurrection called Easter.

1242. Battle of lake Peipus, in Russia; the Russians under Alexander

made prisoners. The German knights were pardoned, but the Esthonians
were ordered to be hung as Russian rebels.

Tourneville, bishop of Angers, with a copy of Faust and Schoeffer's
Bible for the sum of 40 crowns, bears this date.

1605. JOHN STOW, an English antiquary and historian, died, aged 80. He
was born in London, 1525, and initiated by his father into all the
mysteries of tailoring as practiced at that period. But he discovered a
penchant for musty relics and antiquarian lumber, and finally quitted
his business to compose a history of England. He at length got together
such a medley of antique and diabolical books and parchments, that he
became suspected of some heretical designs against religion, so that the
bishop of London ordered an investigation of his library. He published
_A Summarie of the Englyshe Chronicles_, and in 1598 a _Survey of
London_, on which he was long employed, and which has been often
reprinted. He was reduced to live by charity, and at length fell a
victim to poverty and disease. His labors formed a rich legacy to future
historians.

1621. JOHN CARVER, first governor of Massachusetts, died. He conducted
the colonists over from Leyden, and managed the affairs of the
settlement with great prudence and address.

1676. JOHN WINTHROP, first governor of Connecticut, died. He was the
eldest son of the governor of Massachusetts, and a man of great learning
and talents. He was one of the founders of the Royal society,
distinguished as one of the greatest chemists and physicians of the day,
and one of the most noted men in New England. In 1635 he came over to
settle a plantation on Connecticut river, and began the town of Saybrook
at the mouth of that river.

d'Eglantine, Bazire, Chabot, and others of the most noted of his fellow
desperadoes in the convention, caused them to be arrested as
conspirators against the republic, and after a summary trial, they were
executed by the guillotine on this day. The government of France was
now almost entirely vested in one man, under whose sanguinary
administration the prisons of Paris contained at one time more than
seven thousand persons, and a day seldom passed without sixty or eighty
executions by the revolutionary axe.

1794. MARIE JEAN HERAULT DE SECHELLES, a French statesman, guillotined.
He conducted before the revolution as an able and upright officer; but
as the scene progressed he became identified with the terrorists, and
went to the scaffold with Danton, Desmoulins, (q. v.) and others. The
two conducted with as much levity in their last moments as if they had
been going to a party of pleasure.

1794. BENEDICT CAMILLE DESMOULINS, one of the founders of the Jacobin
club in France, guillotined. He was the friend of Danton, and one of the
most bloody and reckless of the revolutionists. When arraigned by order
of Robespierre, he was asked his age, to which he replied "_33 ans,
l'age du sans culotte Jesus Christ_." His wife, whom he adored, a

valuable writings on science, but his great work the _Universal Cambist_
entitles him to lasting distinction.

Macedonian month Daesius. He lived 32 years and 10 months, and reigned,
computing from the Olympiad six months prior to the death of Philip, 12
years and 10 months--a brief career of extraordinary, but profitless
glory.

1190. RICHARD I (_Coeur de Lion_), killed at the siege of Chalus, in
France. He commenced his career by rebellion against his father. On
ascending the throne of England, he plundered and massacred the Jews,
and set sail for Palestine with the bravest of his subjects. Taking the
lead in the crusade, he gained a series of victories over the Moslem. On
his way home he was seized and imprisoned, and ransomed by his subjects
with 150,000 marks. He was preparing for another crusade, when his
career was suddenly terminated by a wound from a cross-bow, in the 42d
year of his age.

Provencal family which became extinct in the 16th century, inherited a
large fortune by the death of her father, and married Hugh de Sade of
Avignon. She was considered the most beautiful woman of the city.
Petrarch says it was 6 o'clock in the morning of the 6th April, 1327,
that he first saw her in the church of the nuns of St. Clara; and it was
at the same hour of the same day, 1348, that she died of the plague.

solemnity. They lie under a part of the city which was undermined some
centuries ago, to furnish stone for the ancient edifices of Paris, and
at length became closed up. This cemetery had been used more than a
thousand years by twenty parishes, and it is estimated that more than
three millions of people had been inhumed within its inclosures. In
process of time, as the city extended, palaces and churches were built
over the subterranean caverns, and were in imminent danger of sinking
into the pit below, before it was again discovered. The mighty city of
Paris had until now but one burial place, where a pit was dug, and the
bodies laid side by side, without any earth being put over them, till
the first tier was full; then a thin layer of earth covered them, and
another tier of dead came on; thus by layer upon layer, and dead upon
dead, the hole was filled up. These pits were emptied every thirty or
forty years to receive new tenants. The last grave digger, Francis
Pontraci, had by his own register, in less than thirty years, inhumed
more than 90,000 bodies in that ground. The great increase of burials
rendered the cemetery still more inconvenient, and it was at last
happily thought of converting the quarries under the city into a
receptacle for the dead.

as a poet, on his Italian poems.

1626. FRANCIS BACON, an English philosopher, died, aged 66. At the age
of 13 he entered the university, where he made the most astonishing
progress in all the sciences then taught, and at the age of 16 attacked
the Aristotlean philosophy. He succeeded rapidly in office under
government, and in 1619 was appointed lord high chancellor of England
and baron of Verulam. Here, unfortunately, he sullied his name, and was
fined, imprisoned and degraded, for bribery and corruption. This

of experimental philosophy."

probably by poison, frustrated the plan, and plunged him in excessive
grief. Her amiable disposition, gentleness of character and modesty, won
her general favor, and she was universally lamented by the French.

1603. A couple of vessels, fitted out by the mayor and aldermen of
Bristol, under the command of Martin Pring, to make discoveries on the

exported to Great Britain. Of this, they procured a cargo near Bristol,
Rhode Island.

two colonies. Although 109 years had elapsed since the discovery of the

entered the Austrian service. His first campaign was in capacity of a
volunteer against the Turks; where he acquitted himself with so much
distinction, that he was appointed to the command of a company of
dragoons. He finally rose step by step to the rank of commander in chief
of the Austrian army, and achieved a succession of brilliant victories
and enterprises in Europe, which humbled the arms of the French, and
rendered his name immortal in the annals of fame. His successful
campaign in conjunction with the duke of Marlborough, rendered him so
popular in England, that a maiden lady bequeathed him L2500, and a
gardener L100. [By some authorities, 21st.]

of the Austrian army two days in succession, executed a variety of
movements, considered as among the most admirable displays of his
science, by which he brought the whole of his force upon the army of the
archduke Charles, which he had concentrated at Eckmuhl. The battle is
said to have been one of the most splendid which the art of war could
display. The Austrian army, of upwards of 100,000 men, were dispossessed
of all their positions, by the combined attack of the French, whose
divisions appeared on the field, each in its due place and order, as
regularly as the movements of the various pieces in the game of chess.
The battle commenced at two in the afternoon and continued till
nightfall. It resulted in the complete overthrow of the Austrians; all
their wounded, a great part of their artillery, fifteen stands of
colors, and 20,000 prisoners, remained in the power of the French to
which their loss in the field may be added. Their retreat was also
attended with corresponding loss.

adventurer; who immediately sent home a ship with the intelligence, and

trouble would have arisen out of the case, had not the two monarchs been
kinsmen and friends.

Saxons, who lost 1200 killed, and the elector was wounded and taken

of great eloquence and extensive learning.

1616. WILLIAM SHAKSPEARE, the English dramatist, died, aged 52. His
history is shrouded in obscurity; but the success of his dramas, with
the sobriety and moderation of his views, enabled him to retire early
with a competence. The writings of this great poet of nature are found
in the libraries of the greatest foes of the drama. This is also the
anniversary of his birthday, 1564.

1616. MICHAEL DE CERVANTES SAAVEDRA, the Spanish novelist, died, aged

II. John Winthrop was appointed governor until a new election should be

fact was, they considered their civil and religious code rather superior
to any thing else of the kind in the world, and were exceedingly jealous
of contamination.

1808. MURAT, at the head of 40,000 French soldiers, taking advantage of
a faction among the people, entered Madrid and took possession of it.

1809. Battle of Ratisbon. The Austrians, having sustained defeat and
losses four days successively, made some attempt to fortify this city,
in order to protect the retreat of the army. The French, who had
advanced to the storm, were cut down by the musquetry of the besieged.
There was at length difficulty in finding volunteers to renew the
attack, when the impetuous Lannes, by whom they were commanded, seized a
ladder and rushed forward to fix it himself against the wall. "I will
show," exclaimed he, "that your general is still a grenadier." The
French rallied and carried the ramparts--the contest was renewed in the
street, and the city fired. The Austrians were driven out of Ratisbon,
leaving cannon, baggage and prisoners in the hands of the French. Thus
in five days, in spite of the inferiority of numbers and the imperfect
manner in which his troops were combined, Bonaparte, by the sole energy
of his genius, triumphed over the main forces of his opponent, and
opened the road to his capital. At no period of his momentous career,
says Scott, did the genius of Napoleon appear more completely to
prostrate all opposition; at no time did the talents of a single
individual exercise such an influence on the fate of the universe.

1810. Fort Matagorda, having bean reduced to a heap of ruins, was

the author of _Robinson Crusoe_, which was supposed at first to be a
true narrative, and afterwards as erroneously to have been founded upon
the papers of Alexander Selkirk. It still enjoys an old age of honor and
renown, which it is impossible for any eulogium to exalt. Like its hero,
it has traveled into the most distant regions, and worn the costume of
literature and the garland of fame in almost every civilized country of
the globe.

youth, which had left their universities to support the cause of
national honor and freedom; and on the other, the young men of Paris,
many of them of the best rank, who bravely endeavored to sustain their
country's long pre-eminent claim to victory. Both combatted under the
eyes of their respective sovereigns, maintained the honor of their
country, and paid an ample tribute to the carnage of the day. The
victory finally resulted to the arms of the French, by the superior
generalship of their great leader, and the determined bravery of his
troops. The allies sustained a loss of 20,000, and among them several
experienced officers. The French loss was severe.

their death, and repair the honor of his nation. The Spaniards were well
fortified to the number of 400 in their forts; but de Gourges resolutely
pressed forward, and after a desperate assault carried the forts. Those
who escaped the massacre were hung upon the same trees on which the
Frenchmen had previously been hung. The Spaniards had placed over their
victims a label, signifying, "_I do not this as to Frenchmen, but as to
Lutherans_." De Gourges replaced it with a tablet of fir wood, on which
was graven the following: "_I do not this as to Spaniards, nor as to

prisoner of the Spaniards in his palace, and the principal nobles
gathered there for the dance, when the Spaniards fell upon them with the
utmost fury. The victims were unable to defend themselves or escape by

into the river where they perished, and others were killed under the

daylight disclosing the error, and the fewness of their assailants, they

1099. The army of crusaders who had encamped before Jerusalem, made a
furious attack on this city, and amid a storm of arrows and fire balls,
burst the first barrier, and strove to surmount the walls by escalade.

followers of the cross were driven back with shame and slaughter to
their camp. This defeat was followed by suffering and privations, from
the scarcity of provisions and water.

1211. Battle of Tolosa, in Spain, between the Christians and Moors.
Mohammed Abu Abdallah, at the head of a powerful army, one of the five
divisions of which, according to the Arabic and Spanish historians,
amounted to 160,000 men, made a descent from Africa, with the design of
conquering the whole Spanish peninsula. Such was the terror which this
vast armament inspired among the Christians, that Innocent III,
proclaimed a crusade, and several bishops went from town to town to
rouse the Christian princes. The kings of Castile, Arragon and Navarre,
with a numerous body of foreign volunteers, advanced to stop the
progress of the Moslems. The two armies met in Las Navas de Tolosa,
between Castile and Andalusia. The result of the engagement was so
complete a victory over the Africans, that Mohammed had a narrow escape,
and left no less than 170,000 men in the field; the rest fled for
safety.

himself odious by his cruelties. James was defeated in battle, and put
to death in a mill, by the daggers of his own subjects.

1676. Attack on Hadley by the Indians, to the number of 700, who were
resolved on a grand effort to carry this post. The attack was commenced
at day-light, with great spirit; they gained possession of a house, and
fired a barn; but were in a short time driven back with loss. The attack
was renewed on other points, the enemy appearing to be determined on
carrying the place; but the discharge of a piece of ordnance cooled
their ardor, and they drew off; and on assistance coming from
Northampton, the foe was driven into the woods, with a loss of two or
three of the English. It is supposed to have been on this occasion that
general Goffe, one of the judges of Charles I, who was at that time
concealed with the minister at Hadley, made his appearance in so
mysterious a manner. At a moment when the people were in the greatest
consternation, there appeared a man of venerable aspect, differing from
them in his apparel, who assumed the command, put them in order for
defence, and by advice and example animated them throughout the attack.
When the scene was over, on looking about for the stranger, he had
disappeared, and was seen no more--leaving the inhabitants to form the
strangest conjectures.

1683. The Rye house plot discovered. It was headed by Monmouth, Essex,
and lord John Russell, and their object seems to have been to oppose

Monmouth was in a short time reconciled to the king.

with the loss of 2000 killed, and all their women, children, baggage and
cattle, taken by the Chinese.

arms, 12,000 barrels of powder, and a large quantity of shot and shell.
The order of knights from this day became virtually extinct; from a
position of political importance it fell to the level of an obscure
association, and such, as far as human foresight goes, it is destined to
remain.

practice of law in New York, and rose to the highest eminence in the
profession. He was appointed secretary of the treasury under Washington.
As a statesman and a financier he revived the public credit, and placed
the United States revenue on a permanent footing. Of all the coadjutors
and advisors of Washington, Hamilton was doubtless the one in whose
judgment and sagacity he reposed the greatest confidence, whether in
military or civil career; and of all the American statesmen, he

tribe was exterminated. They had secreted themselves in a swamp near
where Fairfield now stands, in Connecticut; when some of the rangers who
were in pursuit of them discovering their lurking place, rushed in upon
them, in defiance of their arrows, and the hazard of being swallowed in
the miry bogs. After a fruitless parley, the Indians refusing to come to
terms, the soldiers were ordered to cut through the swamp with their
swords, in order to hem them in, till they were begirt in a narrow space
and remained all night sorely galled by the fire of their besiegers.
Taking advantage of a dense fog, some of the stoutest made their escape,
leaving the rest to the mercy of their conquerors. They were discovered
in the morning sitting in crowds, sullenly refusing to ask for their
lives, and were shot by dozens or cut in pieces. The male children which

1789. Destruction of the Bastile, at Paris. This awful fortress of
despotism, of which the name had for ages inspired terror, and which had
withstood a vigorous siege about two centuries previous, was invested by
a mixed multitude of citizens and soldiers. De Launay, the governor,
displayed a flag of truce and demanded a parley, but abusing the
confidence which that signal inspired, he discharged a heavy fire of
cannon and musketry on the besiegers. This act of treachery, so far from
intimidating the people, inflamed their rage and rendered them
desperate. They renewed the attack with frenzy, and carried the prison
by assault. The governor was seized and massacred, and his head carried
in triumph through the streets. The Bastile was razed to the ground, and
with it the despotism of the French monarchy fell prostrate in the dust.
It cost 200,000 livres to demolish this edifice to its foundations, and
the materials were sold for 36,000.

1790. GIDEON ERNEST LAUDOHN, an Austrian field marshal, died. He was

French ships laden with provisions.

American privateer schooner Perry of five guns, after a running fight of
fifty, and a close action, of ten minutes.

1817. ANNA LOUISA GERMAINE NECKER, baroness de Stael Holstein, died. Her
talents were so early displayed that she was said never to have been a
child, and she became distinguished at an early age as a writer, and by
the spirit of her conversation. She was banished twice by Napoleon for
attempting to thwart his government. Her works form 17 vols.

1834. EDMUND CHARLES GENET, a French statesman, died. He was a minister

commencement of the railway from Cairo to Alexandria.

JULY 15.

496 B. C. Battle of Regillum, in which it is said the twin knights
Castor and Pollux appeared upon white horses and assisted the Romans. In
memory of this event an annual cavalcade was instituted at Rome, during
which the knights, robed in purple, and crowned with olive wreaths, rode
in solemn procession from the temple of Honor to the Capitol, where the
censor, seated on his curule chair, passed judgment on their characters.

238. MAXIMUS and BALBINUS, emperors of Rome, murdered by the praetorian
guards.

1099. Jerusalem taken by the crusaders on the 39th day of the siege. Two
huge movable towers had been constructed, and rolled with great labor to
the foot of the fortifications. From the tops of these they fought the
besieged on even terms till afternoon, when a warrior named Letolde
leapt upon the ramparts and was followed by all the other knights, and
drove the Saracens down into the city. The standard of the cross was
planted in triumph on the walls, and after 460 years of bondage, the
holy city passed from under the Moslem yoke. The victory thus bravely
won, was tarnished by the ferocity of the conquerors. The number who
were slain in the city amounted to 70,000, and the Jews were burnt in
their synagogues.

1535. TRAJAN'S floating palace (which was sunk at a great depth in lake
Nemi, Italy, 1340 years before) explored by Marchi in a diving machine.
It was found in a tolerable state of preservation, measuring 500 feet in
length, 270 in breadth and 60 in depth. This magnificent work was
designed for the retirement of a prince celebrated for his magnificent
taste, and were it possible to rescue it from its present position, or
examine the interior, many valuable relics might be brought to light, to
enrich the cabinet of the antiquarian if not to subserve the use of the
sciences.

1546. The protestants having assembled a force of 70,000 foot, 15,000
horse, and 6,000 pioneers, with 120 cannon, 800 ammunition wagons, 8,000
beasts of burden, determined to support their cause by the force of
arms. They issued a manifesto, and sent a letter to Charles V. (See July
20.) They were, however, overcome without battle, in consequence of
having separated themselves into small bodies early in 1547.

1557. ANNE OF CLEVES, one of the queens of Henry VIII of England, died.
The king demanded her in marriage after having seen her picture. But the
painter had flattered the beauty, and the king becoming disgusted with
what he termed a _Flanders mare_, obtained a divorce and sent her home
again. She retired, seemingly unconcerned, and no doubt considered it a
matter of great good fortune to have escaped with life.

1557. A great dearth of breadstuffs in England; wheat L2 13s. 4d.; malt
L2 4s.; peas L2 6d. per quarter.

served an apprenticeship in arms under Francis of Guise, and is supposed
to have visited most of the countries of Europe, either in a military
capacity or as a traveler. His memoirs or works were published in 1666,
and several editions have since been printed. It is represented to be a
rare work, but has never been translated into English. (_Biog. Univer._
says July 5, q. v.)

1685. JAMES, duke of Monmouth, beheaded. He was the natural son of
Charles II, against whom he rebelled; and on the accession of James II,
he invaded England, was defeated, (See July 5,) imprisoned and finally
brought to the scaffold, after having made the most humiliating
petitions for his life.

1715. BELL, the Scottish traveler, left St. Petersburg for Persia, with
the Russian embassy, in the quality of physician. They were obliged by
the severity of the weather to halt at Cazan and pass the winter, and
were detained there till June 4, 1716. They then proceeded by Astraken,
the Caspian sea and Tauris to Ispahan, where they arrived in 1717.

1716. The island of Corfu, besieged by 80,000 Turks, and defended by
the Venetians, was attacked by the Turkish admiral with 22 ships, and
an attempt was made by the land forces to storm the citadel; but the

counter sally with 2000 men, took the Turks by surprise in the rear, who
fled, leaving 4000 dead in the trenches.

1751. JOHN WILSON, an eminent English botanist, died. His occupation was
that of a shoemaker, and he ranks among the self-elevated men, who
without a liberal education have distinguished themselves by scientific
and literary abilities. He became an expert and accurate botanist before
Linnaeus's method of discriminating species improved the science, and
published a _Synopsis of British Plants_. He was the first writer that
attempted a systematic arrangement of indigenous plants in the English
language.

of an immense crowd.

Greek and Latin assistant in his father's school, at the age of 9 years;
and is said to have written as much genuine poetry at 10, as either
Cowley, Milton or Pope had produced at nearly twice that age. He was, at

days before the flight of Mohammed from Mecca to Medina.

1054. MICHAEL CERULARIUS, the Greek patriarch, excommunicated at
Constantinople by the pope's legates. "Shaking the dust from their feet,
they deposited on the altar of St. Sophia, a direful anathema, which
enumerates the seven mortal heresies of the Greeks, and devotes them to
the eternal society of the devil and his angels." The Greeks have never
abandoned their errors, the popes have never repealed the sentence, and
from this thunderbolt we may date the consummation of the schism between
the two churches.

sequins, and the other of silver, representing the Mexican year, also
wrought with figures in bas-relief. His object was to prepossess the
king against the representations which might be made by the governor of
Cuba.

1546. ANNE ASKEW (or _Ascough_), an accomplished protestant lady, after
having been tortured, was burnt for heresy. It is remarkable that her

of London _incendiary_, in that unmanly work.

four assassins and his body dragged through the streets with every mark
of indignity.

intrigues and crimes, executed at Paris. She cut off her relatives by

with indifference.

1691. FRANCIS MICHAEL LE TELLIER, a French statesman, died. He was a
great favorite with Louis XIV, who on a certain occasion treated him

talents, which he exerted for the benefit of his country.

honorable and useful; and his advanced years in deeds of benevolence. He
erected the princely seat of Canons, near London, where he lived in a
splendor to which no other subject had ever aspired. His liberality was
equaled only by his generous forgiveness of injuries. Pope made him the
subject of his satire, which Hogarth punished by representing the poet
on a scaffold whitewashing Burlington house, and bespattering the duke
of Chandos's carriage as it passed. Yet Pope's verse respecting the
short-lived magnificence of Canons was prophetic:

     Another age shall see the golden ear
     Embrown the slope, and nod on the parterre:
     Deep harvests bury all his pride has planned,
     And laughing Ceres reassume the land.

1676. King PHILIP (or _Metacom_), killed at Mount Hope, in Rhode Island,
whither he had been driven by the English, as a last refuge. One of his
confederates proposing peace, so irritated Philip that he killed him. A
brother of the murdered Indian repaired to the English camp, and offered
to lead them to Philip's retreat. Captain Church set out with a small
body of men, accompanied by a few friendly Indians, and attacked the
chief in his den. He formed his men in extended order, placing an
Englishman and an indian together, with orders to fire on any who should
attempt to escape. At the dawn of day the sentinels alarmed the camp,
when Philip seized his arms and attempted to escape; as he approached
two of Church's guards, the Englishman leveled his gun, which missed
fire; the Indian sent two balls through his body, one of which piercing
his heart, laid him dead upon the spot. When the battle was over, the
English repaired to the place where he lay. He had fallen on his face in
a muddy spot of the ground, from which he was drawn; the head was taken
off and the body left to be devoured by wild beasts. Thus fell a
powerful chief, and a ferocious savage. It was then hailed with joy as
the extinction of a virulent and implacable enemy; but is now often
viewed as the fall of a great statesman and a mighty prince, who died in
defence of his just rights. This was a war of extermination; it was a
general rising of the Indians, under a powerful and sagacious warrior,
against the English, not a vestige of whom would have been left had they
been victorious. As it was, several of the tribes were annihilated; a
miserable remnant of the others incorporated themselves with distant and
strange nations. In this short but tremendous war, about 600 of the
white inhabitants, composing its principal strength, were either killed
in battle or murdered; 12 towns entirely destroyed, and 600 dwellings
burnt. The English triumphed, indeed, but the ravages of the enemy left

the English colonies; had resided at this place twenty-six years, and
become thoroughly acquainted with the country. An expedition was fitted
out to destroy his den. The place was attacked by 240 men, and carried.
Ralle was found in his cabin firing upon the English; orders had been
given to take him alive, if possible; but refusing to ask quarter he was
shot down. Eighty were killed, among which were some of the most noted
warriors of the tribe, and the remnant scattered. Ralle was a man of
extensive learning, and of great service to the French; he wrote a
dictionary of the Norridgewock language, which was taken, and is
deposited in Harvard library. He was sent out as a missionary, had
acquired the languages of nearly all the tribes in America, and spent
thirty-seven years among them.

1521. CORTEZ retook the city of Mexico, assisted by 10,000 Tlascalans,
and an innumerable host of other Indian allies from the neighboring
nations, whom he had attached to his service. It was not, however, till
after seventy-five days of fierce and almost daily fighting, that he
accomplished his victory. On no occasion did native Americans so bravely
oppose European troops; but the superior discipline of the Spaniards
carried the day: and thus a daring adventurer, regarded and treated by
his countrymen as a rebel, after a bloody struggle, gained possession of
a country which for more than three centuries formed one of the
brightest gems in the Castilian crown. It is computed that during this
siege 100,000 Mexicans were slain and 50,000 died of sickness and
famine. The inhabitants being ordered to leave the city without arms or
baggage, the three roads leading from it were full of men, women and
children, in the most wretched condition, for three days and nights,

destitute of ammunition.

this performance. He had one line to speak, apparently an easy task, but
when he found himself in presence of the audience, he was panic struck;

of the defiles and a warm skirmishing fire commenced. At this moment
Bonaparte came up. He rode into the mouth of the pass, surveyed the
scene for a moment, and perceiving that his infantry were making no
progress, at once conceived the daring idea of causing his Polish
lancers to charge right up the causeway in face of the battery. The
smoke of the skirmishers on the hill sides mingled with the thick fogs

revolution of 1830 his adherence to the Bourbons incensed the mob to
level the archiepiscopal palace to the ground, by which he was reduced
to poverty. He was a man of distinguished talents and learning.

1840. PRENTISS MELLEN, chief justice of Maine, died at Portland, aged
77. The first eleven volumes of the _Maine Reports_ are a monument of
his legal discrimination, great familiarity with practice, and high
sense of justice.

1846. JAMES COCHRAN died at Batavia, Genesee co., N. Y., aged 83. To him
the world owes the invaluable invention of making cut nails, yet he died
poor.

1849. Hudson river rail road opened to Poughkeepsie.

1852. AMOS LAWRENCE, a wealthy and leading Boston merchant, died, aged
77. His charities amounted to several hundred thousands of dollars.

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
