A PRESENT, &c.




_No. 1.--Little Girl and Pitcher._


TAKE care, little girl, that you do not fall into the water; for if
once you fell in, you could not get out again, unless somebody happened
to come to your assistance. When you are sent by your mother to fetch
water, you should be careful how you dip your jug in; and after it is
filled, you should go steadily home, without playing by the way.




_No. 2.--Sheep and Lambs._


    Dearest Fanny, come to me,
      Take and eat my sweet grass here;
    Once you never us'd to flee,
      When with joy I did appear.

    But now, your lambkin by your side
      Takes all your thoughts and all your care;
    I may go, and run, and ride,
      You are careless how, or where.




_No. 3.--Man and Ass._


"Turnips, cabbages, carrots, Ho! Now try, Ma'am; I dare say you and
I can agree upon a price for this bunch of turnips: they were fresh
gathered this morning, I assure you; and I think if you buy of me once,
you will never buy of any body else.--Pray, Ma'am, try my fine, fresh
codlins. They are very cheap, and as large as you can get any where."




_No. 4.--Milk-maid and Cow._


How quiet that cow seems, which Molly the dairy-maid has just been
milking. In some parts of the world there are wild cows, and buffaloes
too, which will kill those who attack them, if they can; but in this
happy island, there are no fierce wild beasts, to frighten us from the
fields by day, or disturb our slumbers by night.

[Illustration: 5]

[Illustration: 6]




_No. 5.--Gentleman and Boy riding._


    To Brighton or Worthing, and all with full speed,
      Which way are you going so mightily fast?
    Take care of the reins, for your mettlesome steed
      Might stumble and lay you too low at the last.

    With spurs and with boots you are finely set out,
      To take a long journey o'er hill and o'er dale;
    But remember one thing--'tis of mighty import--
      Your poney may founder, and all his strength fail.

    And you, too, confess, when you weary have been,
      At the end of your journey, wherever you roam;
    That, tho' houses, and parks, and fine rivers you've seen,
      There's no place so happy, so sweet as your home.




_No. 6.--Man and Woman._


Ah, poor people, how sorry I am for you! I hope you have not far to go
before you see your nice little cottage. It is dismal walking in such
weather; but as you are caught in the rain, you must make the best of
your way, and be thankful you have a home to shelter you.




_No. 7.--The Gravel-pit._


How industriously these men are working. One is picking down the hard
gravel, with a pick-axe: the other is taking it up with a shovel, and
putting it into a sieve. All the small pieces go through, and the great
stones remain. The sifted gravel, I suppose, will be carried in a cart
to some gentleman's garden, to make walks; and the stones will be used
in mending the roads.




_No. 8.--Gardener._


"May I dig a little for you, father? I am sure I can dig very nicely,
if you will but let me try"--"And I can pull up the weeds," said little
Jane.--"You are both mistaken," replied their father: "you, John, have
not strength to put the spade far enough into the hard ground; and you,
Jane, would be apt to pull up flowers as well as weeds: and so you must
both be satisfied to work in your own little gardens for the present,
till the one is stronger, and the other wiser."

[Illustration: 7]

[Illustration: 8]

[Illustration: 9]

[Illustration: 10]




_No. 9.--The Well._


The man who is drawing up water from the well, appears to have rather
hard work. Wells are very useful things: in them is collected a great
quantity of water, which can be drawn up by means of a rope and bucket;
and though it is some trouble to do this, we must be willing to take
it, for the sake of getting such a useful, pleasant thing as water.




_No. 10.--Little Girl and Ducks._


"Oh you pretty little duck, how I I should like to nurse you," said
Amelia. "That would be a great unkindness," replied her father: "the
little duck is fond of being in the water, and by the side of its
mother; and therefore it would be quite unhappy in your warm hands.
Little ducks and chickens run to their mother the moment they hear
her call; and little boys and girls should be obedient to their kind
parents, because they love them affectionately."




_No. 11.--Boys and Ass._


I am glad to see these boys are not teasing their ass, but, on the
contrary, are taking pleasure in putting a bough on its head, to keep
the flies off. Some boys are very cruel to poor asses. The dog in this
picture seems to be rather angry at something, but I cannot think at
what; for these good boys look as if they were kind to him, as well as
to their donkey.




_No. 12.--Children and Chaise._


    Oh! how delightful and charming
      To take the fresh air in a chaise;
    To gallop along without harming:
      Whip away! what a dust you do raise!

    Of trees and of ponds too beware;
      Mind likewise to treat well your ass;
    And then, with attention and care,
      Your time will in happiness pass.

[Illustration: 11]

[Illustration: 12]

[Illustration: 13]

[Illustration: 14]




_No. 13.--Chopping Wood._


This man has in his hand a bill, and he is probably going to cut up the
tree for fire-wood. The little girl seems to be catching the chips, to
carry home to her mother. What a nice thing it is to see a little girl
employed in helping her father; which, indeed, all little girls ought
to endeavour to do, because most parents do a great deal for their
children; and some have, like this man, to work _very hard for them_.




_No. 14.--Harvest Field._


Oh! what a delightful sight is the harvest-field. Our great Creator has
made the corn grow, to make nice food for the use of man. One of these
men is cutting down the corn, and the other is binding it up into a
sheaf; whilst those at a distance are carrying a waggon-full home, to
put into the barn. They have got a little cask of beer, which is a
necessary refreshment, after having worked hard in the hot sun.




_No. 15.--Blind Man._


    To kindest pity now inclin'd,
      See these children wish to give
    A trifle to the poor and blind,
      Thus assisting him to live.

    See, all ragged and forlorn,
      He is resting by a tree;
    And to him the light of morn
      And shades of eve alike must be.

    Kind pity then, thou blessed gift,
      Help and relieve the sore distress'd;
    And up to heav'n his heart he'll lift,
      That you with mercy may be blest.

[Illustration: 15]

[Illustration: 16]



_No. 16.--Man sowing Corn._


This man is sowing seed, perhaps wheat or oats. The ground has been
prepared by ploughing and harrowing. That box holds the seed. After the
field is sown, a boy will be set to keep off the birds, which would
otherwise come and eat up a great deal of it.

[Illustration: 17]




_No. 17.--The Shepherd._


"Remark," said a fond mother to her little girl, whilst admiring a fine
flock of sheep feeding in a green meadow, "how good our Heavenly
Father is to all his creatures. He makes the grass, to serve the sheep
for a soft couch to lie down upon when they are tired, and to afford
them a pleasant meal when they are hungry."

[Illustration: 18]




_No. 18.--Mother and Children._


Some people are rich, and have plenty of every thing they wish for;
whilst others are poor, and are obliged to be contented with few
things. The rich farmer gives his poor neighbours leave to pick up the
ears of corn that are scattered about, to make them a few loaves in the
winter. See that cottager, with a load upon her head: her eldest girl
is helping her; and a chubby little boy trudges joyfully by her side.




_No. 19.--Errand Cart._


If you have any parcels to send, good people, pray make haste and
overtake this man, who is called an errand-man. He makes it his
business to carry parcels, for which you must pay him a small sum. His
dog probably guards his parcels, when he has occasion to stop at a
house and leave his cart.




_No. 20.--Mill._


Within this mill are two very large stones: one of them is kept quite
quiet, whilst the other is moved round; and the corn being put between
them, is ground to a powder. Afterwards, all the coarse parts of the
husk are taken away by means of sifting: this coarse part is called
bran; and the fine white inside is flour, of which bread is made.

[Illustration: 19]

[Illustration: 20 & 21]



_No. 21.--Dobbin._


"Whoa, Dobbin!" says a man to his horse: "if you go further into the
pond, I shall have to follow you, which I shall not like, with my shoes
and stockings on." The other horse is drinking very quietly. What a
pleasant thing to have a nice pond to go to when they are thirsty;
and I hope the men also have got a nice supper at home, and kind wives
and children to welcome their return.

[Illustration: 22]

[Illustration: 23]




_No. 22.--Child and Chickens._


"Chick, chick, chick, here is some corn for you, and crumbs of bread
and cheese, which mamma saved for you after dinner. Now mind, you
little things, don't quarrel about the pieces: if you do, I won't give
you any more."




_No. 23.--Rabbit, Goat, and Hare._


Here are three very pretty animals. The first is a rabbit, of a kind,
gentle disposition. The second is a goat: he is by nature wild, and
jumps about from crag to crag, on his native mountains. The third is
the timid hare. I am afraid she is running from the pursuit of the dog.
Ah! what a cruel thing it is to set dogs to hunt this beautiful little
animal.

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
