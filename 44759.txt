MAY DAY.

(_Strictly according to Precedent._)

  Open the windows, salute the day;
  Welcome, welcome the First of May.
  Everything's changed, or ought to be,
  Buds are bursting on hedge and tree.
  Sweet winds breathe from the West or South
  Soft as a kiss from a maiden's mouth.
  Everything speaks of warmth and love,
  Bright is the sun in the blue above.
  Out in the woods, I know. I know,
  Fur and feather are all aglow.
  Downy rabbits with jewel eyes
  Dart about in a wild surprise.
  Yellow-billed blackbird, speckled thrush,
  Pour their notes in a tuneful gush.
  And all the neat little boys and girls,
  With clean fresh faces and hair in curls,
  Sing in a chorus, "Hurray, hurray!
  April's gone, it's the First of May!"

  * * *

  That's how I dreamt my May-day dream;
  But things are not what they ought to seem.
  For the wind--why, bless me, the wind is East,
  And the birds don't warble or chirp the least.
  The whole of the sky is wrapped in gloom.
  And fires are lighting in every room.
  And I shiver and sneeze and spend my day
  In a winter-suit on the First of May.

AUK'D ABOUT.--The skin of a Great Auk was put up for sale last week,
but the reserved price was not reached. Evidently it was of bad omen
that it should have been put up at an "Auk-shun."

DRAMATIC FAMILY LIKENESS.

For the plot of _The Passport_, recently produced with a fair amount
of success at Terry's Theatre, the authors admit their indebtedness
to Colonel SAVAGE'S novel, _My Official Wife_. Oddly enough, this plot
bears a considerable resemblance to that of _The Orient Express_, a
piece "made in Germany," of which the English adaptation was produced
here, at Daly's, during his season. In this piece, _i.e._, _The Orient
Express_, a gentleman has tourist tickets for himself and wife; but
his wife, after disposing of her ticket to a professional _cicerone_,
returns to England alone, while her husband, travelling on business,
continues his journey. The _cicerone_ has sold the ticket cheap to a
lady, who is therefore compelled to travel under the name inscribed on
the ticket, and finds herself in the same carriage with the gentleman
who has the corresponding ticket, and the ticket-collector, seeing
the same names, hands back both tickets to the gentleman, and tries
to keep the carriage strictly reserved for them all the way, in
which attempt he fails, and hence arise, on their return to England,
complications analogous to those of _The Passport_. Was the novel of
_My Official Wife_ written before the German farcical play, or is it
only a family likeness?

"IL IRA LOIN."--Dr. FARRAR, now Chaplain to the SPEAKER, has been made

He has gone Far, will go FARRAR and fare better ... and then ...
FARRAR-well to all his greatness!

STRIKES A LA MODE DE PARIS.

(_From the Diary of a Pleasure-seeker of the Future._)

ROSE early, intending to have a real good time of it, in spite of the
recent disturbances. As a precautionary measure, wore my bullet-proof
coat and shell-defying boots. Carried also my armour-plated umbrella,
which can be used (on emergencies) as a shield to quick-firing guns.
Looked out of window, and found the weather splendid. Firing, too
(which I had heard every now and again during the night), seemingly
all but ceased.

On reaching the street, representative of the Civil Power cautioned me
to be careful. Thanked the representative for his courtesy, and asked
why a squadron of hussars were trotting past with drawn sabres. Was
told that the soldiers were engaged in the protection of a sweep
journeying to his work in a donkey-cart.

Started for a stroll, but had to seek shelter in a doorway from a
volley of bullets fired in the direction of the early milkman. From
this demonstration I gathered that the food supply would be still
further restricted owing to the action of the men on strike. After
the purveyor had beaten a hasty retreat, advanced upon a
strongly-fortified position, which turned out to be, as I expected it
would, a doubly-entrenched cab-stand.

Only one vehicle on the rank. Engaged the cabman. Although I was
unaccompanied by a relative or friend, found the space at my disposal
distinctly limited. The top of the four-wheeler was, of course,
occupied by the customary rocket party. The box had its usual sentry,
carrying a couple of revolvers and a search-light. Three of the seats
inside were occupied by sharpshooters, and I retained the fourth.

"We had better make for the river," said the officer in command, and
we fell in with the suggestion.

Our progress was comparatively uneventful. Certainly at the corners
of streets we had to run the gauntlet of a shower of projectiles of
various dimensions; still, the armour-plated sides of the cab turned
aside the flood of iron, and the custodians, by lying flat as occasion
required, escaped without injury. Leaving the steel-protected cab, I
embarked on board an armoured penny steamboat, and made my way down
the river. Fortunately, the helmsman was able to avoid the submarine
mines which had been laid by the Chairman of the Strike Committee. Our
voyage was also rendered exciting by the torpedoes.

Having reached the last pier, I returned to land, and was sufficiently
fortunate to catch an omnibus about to start on its exciting campaign.
The route, which ran chiefly through main thoroughfares, extended to
the length of four miles. Thanks to the exertions of all arms of the
service, the distance was traversed in about three hours. Every inch
of the ground was hotly contested, but the omnibus at length won
the day. The losses on our side consisted of a colonel killed, and
seventy-four rank-and-file wounded. The casualties on the side of the
strikers were infinitely more numerous.

On reaching my destination, I made for home in a balloon, thus
escaping any further molestation.

PRESENTED AT COURT.

DEAR MR. PUNCH,--I notice that "an original dramatic caricature" is
being played at the Court Theatre, under the title of _Vanity Fair_.
To prevent mistakes, I write to say at once that I am on the eve of
constructing a three-volume novel, called _Hamlet, Prince of Denmark_;
a poem, called _Box and Cox_; and a satire, called _Macaulay's History
of England_. I merely mention this fact to protect my copyright in the
names I have chosen for my new works. I have also in contemplation the
writing of a book to be entitled _Adam Bede_, a novelette, to be
known as _King Solomon's Mines_, and a story to be y'clept _Treasure
Island_. May I add that I have also some pantomimes and
eccentric ballets nearly ready that will be christened, when
completed,--_Esmond_, _The Virginians_, _The Newcomes_, _Philip_, and
last, but not least, _Pendennis_.

  Yours truly, NOTHING IF NOT ORIGINAL.

P.S.--I am thinking of adopting as a _nom de plume_ the signature of
"WILLIAM MAKEPEACE THACKERAY."

HIS FAVOURITE SUBJECT.

_Distinguished Amateur soliloquiseth:_--

  _There!!!_ Egotistic ways are my abhorrence;
    But if this masterpiece were only hung
  In the Uffizi Gallery at Florence,
    Where LEIGHTON, like a god, ambrosial, young,
  And MILLAIS, in immortal manhood, stand,
    Self-limned, for admiration of posterity,
  I fancy that this work of my right hand
    Would quite eclipse mere Genius, whose temerity
  In challenging comparison with BIRTH
    Is really getting something unendurable.
  Aha! It moves me to sardonic mirth!
    To dream of _my_ position as securable
  By mere Bismarckian brain!!! Now, as the god,
    _I_ come out admirably. Form and stature,
  The threatening eye, and the earth-shaking nod,
    All, all to me are simply second nature.
  Globe-trampling foot, and hand that grips the bolt,--
    Aye, and the lyre when I would play Apollo--
  Are mine! Will low-born Genius dare revolt,
    Or where _I_ lead Greatness decline to follow?
  Absurd! I hardly know in what great guise
    To paint my greatness! I have sung of AEgir,
  But he was but a sea-god, and his size
    And strength compared with mine were small and meagre.
  I am a Joint-stock Deity, as 'twere,
    Olympus in a nutshell, Neptune, Mars,
  The Cloud-Compeller and the Sungod fair.
    Here I'm pure Jove. And yet somehow it jars
  Upon my spirit to be so restricted
    To one immortal guise, however grand.
  Hah! Gods by their own pencils thus depicted
    Would make a New Valhalla e'en _my_ hand
  Need not disdain to add to. If Narcissus
    Had been a painter, now! There is no stream,
  Though clear as my own Rhine or the Ilissus,
    Could do me justice. I must _paint_ my dream
  Of my Supernal Self. A mere reflection
    From Nature's mirror would but mar my beauty.
  No; I must limn myself for the inspection
    Of men and gods; it is a simple duty.
  _This_ does not satisfy me. And it is
    Too late, I fear, for Grandmamma's R.A.
  Besides, those English journalists _might_ quiz
    Even Imperial Art. They've their own way
  Too much by far in that ill-ordered isle,
    Those cheeky critic-fellows. Let _me_ catch
  A Teuton quill-driver who'll dare to smile
    Upon a masterpiece he cannot match!!!

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.

Messrs. BLACKWOOD are issuing a standard edition of the works of
GEORGE ELIOT. _Adam Bede_, of course, comes first, admirably printed
in dainty volumes of blue and gold. Glancing over the work brings back
to the memory of my Baronite a certain schoolboy who, instead of going
home to dinner, used to spend the interval in the reading-room of a
free library, literally dining off _Adam Bede_, then just out. It
will be interesting to observe how far the public of to-day, more
especially the young men and maidens who read novels, will take to
GEORGE ELIOT. In this new standard edition opportunity, alike in
respect of charm and cheapness, is made alluring.

_The Curse of Intellect_ is an unattractive title, suggestive rather
of a series of essays on the melancholy lives of certain geniuses
than of the weird tale--for such it is--of a Man-Monkey. This story,
published by Messrs. BLACKWOOD, and written by MACHIAVELLI COLIN
CLOUT, is a modern version of _Frankenstein_, the distinction being
that, whereas _Frankenstein_ constructed his own monster, the hero of
this romance, one _Reuben Power_, finds a monster ready to hand in a
kind of "Mr. Gorilla," whom he educates to speak a strange language,
also to read, write, and think in excellent English. This Converted
Ape kills his maker, and then considerately puts an end to his
own miserable existence; he does not, however, possess a soul
(_Frankenstein's_ Monster was also deficient in this respect). "For
O it is such a 'norrible tale;" and, except to those who occasionally
enjoy "a 'norrible tale," this cannot be recommended by

NO. III.--A SOCRATIC EXPERIMENT.

The other day I went out for a walk. My thoughts circled round my head
like bees in a bonnet, and detached themselves slowly from the loose
white honeycomb of my brain to mirror themselves in my soul, as is
usual with me on such occasions. And, somewhere round the corner, a
voice lurked calling out remarks--what I knew not, only that they were
of a highly personal character. The people I met stared at me, and I
stared at them, for I had a presentiment that they were talking about
me, but I took no notice of them--beyond informing them that they were
cowards and blowflies, and requesting to be informed why they enclosed
their dirty interiors in glass. For I am Young GARNAWAY, and when
I take a walk, I generally exchange amenities of this kind with any
persons I happen to meet.

At the Market Place, my friend the Tallow-chandler sat inside his
shop, dozing under a pale canopy of farthing dips.

"Answer me a question," I begged of him. "Why does one yearn for
the top brick off the chimney when one is a child, and yet feel
dissatisfied when, as a man, one receives it on the top of one's
Sunday tile? Why does the sea bird fly inland in winter to get food
from the towns--only to turn up its beak when presented with a ticket
for soup? Why do we----?"

[Illustration: "A clear and practical illustration."]

My friend the Tallow-chandler answered never a word, but chuckled
foolishly to himself and retired behind a barrier of mottled soap.

When I had gone a piece further I reached a back street, where I
found my friend the Bird-stuffer sitting on his doorstep, playing the
mouth-organ.

"Answer me a question," I besought him. "Suppose you found out that
those who hold the reins of government in our town were educating
large blue-bottle flies to make apricot jam out of your and your
neighbours' pig-wash, would you write to the local paper about it,
even if you knew that the editor would decline to insert your letter?"

My friend answered never a word; he only giggled in embarrassment,
struck up a mazurka on his mouth-organ, and began to dance sheepishly.

But, down in Mud Alley, my friend the Dustcart-man sat at his open
window--a family idyll, wife and six small children, all eating onions
and fried fish.

"Answer me a question," I prayed him. "If a person came to you and
said rudely, 'Better anything else than sitting here with your head
in the domestic halter among the potsherds and puffballs of the old
ideals; rather a jolly good row that ends in a fortnight's "hard"
than fat-headed, elephant-footed dulness here with your buzzing brood
around you!' If a person came to you and said that, what reply would
you give him?"

My friend answered never a word; he was out of the window before I had
time to walk away; and in a very few moments I received a clear and
practical illustration of the sort of reply he would give to such a
question.

As for me, I limped home as well as I could, and, when evening fell,
and I was done up in brown paper and vinegar, both my eyes gleamed in
the evening sun with the iridescent glitter of peacocks' tails.

"FOR THIS RELIEF, MUCH THANKS!"

    ["Fort Chitral, April 20.--Colonel KELLY'S force from Gilghit
    arrived to-day.... Much sickness from bad food, excessive
    work, and exposure. Conduct of troops admirable.... The
    discipline, devotion, and fortitude displayed by all ranks
    under circumstances which required all those qualities are
    beyond all praise."--_Dr. Robertson's Summary of the Siege of
    Chitral._]

  "Small time, but, in that small, most greatly liv'd
    This star of England."

            _Chorus: King Henry the Fifth_, Act V., Scene 2.

  Only one more "little war,"--of course,
  Precipitate pluck, and inadequate force--
    Such wars as our England wages
  At terrible cost in British lives,
  And orphan children and widowed wives,
  Whereat, though greatly our glory thrives,
    Our conscience sometimes rages.

  But such little wars may need great hearts,
  And the wandering heroes who play their parts
    For England, the wide world over;
  Fight as well though they fight--and fall--
  In a leagured hut, by a shattered wall,
  As though the purple of WELLINGTON'S pall
    Each death-cold breast should cover.

  Devotion, fortitude, discipline? Yes!
  They always shine in the perilous press,
    Where British soldiers rally.
  Shine as bright in the hopeless dark
  Of the mad _melee_, though there's none to mark
  The scattered wreckage ruddy and stark
    Of the last brave stand or sally.

  We rejoice to hear, though we knew we should,
  Chitral's defenders again made good
    The glorious old tradition
  Of loyalty to the flying flag.
  Cynics may dub it the torn red rag,
  But our tongues shall laud, whilst those tongues can wag,
    That splendid "superstition."

  The men who stood, and the men who came
  O'er ice-bound ridges with hearts aflame,
    To relieve their leagured brothers,
  Have all done well; and the tawny skin
  Of those who helped us to war and win,--
  Well, your little Englander's less akin
    To England than those others!

  "For this relief, much thanks!" And thanks
  To dead, and living, and of all ranks.
    Forget their service? Never!
  "Small time," indeed, but as brightly shone
  "This star of England," as it had done
  On that stricken field when the lurid sun
    Of the Corsican sank for ever.

A FIRST STEP

TOWARDS HISTRIONICS.

(_Under the guidance of Herr Goethemann._)

_Question._ Have you witnessed the performance of the Actor-manager?

_Answer._ No, but I have perused the tragedy of the Author-publisher.

_Q._ Is it a curtain-raiser?

_A._ No, but it is a hair-lifter, in three acts.

_Q._ How many are the persons of the drama?

_A._ Four.

_Q._ Of these, how many are objectionable?

_A._ Five.

_Q._ Kindly resolve this paradox.

_A._ All are objectionable that come on the stage, and one that
doesn't.

_Q._ You speak of the stage; where has the play been given?

_A._ Nowhere. It has not received a license.

_Q._ Is it the close season?

_A._ No, but so much private license was taken by the Author-publisher
that the public censor did not see his way to adding to the amount.

_Q._ Then we shall not see it interpreted by intelligent actors?

_A._ No, for even if license were granted, the Author-publisher would
take all the parts himself.

_Q._ I do not follow this scheme of plurality.

_A._ I quote from his own printed advertisement, "The right of
performing in public this play (_sic_) is reserved by the author."

_Q._ Did you state that it is a tragedy?

_A._ Yes, but inclining to farce.

_Q._ Does it move the reader to pity and terror?

_A._ Yes, both. Pity for himself, and terror of the next thing of the
kind that he may have to read.

_Q._ Has it any other of the high qualities of the Greek Tragedy?

_A._ It says it has the unities.

_Q._ A severe attack?

_A._ No, the Norwegian kind; a form of Teutonic measles, painful but
transitory.

_Q._ Is it heroic?

_A._ No, but it is suburban.

_Q._ Is the conclusion worthy of a great tragedy? Does it end in a
lurid light of whole-souled passion and death?

_A._ It ends about 4 A.M. the next day, with a cock crowing. The
protagonist has come home intoxicated, and remains so. I regret to
add that he pushes the heroine, she having displaced his beverage by
breaking the glass. She slaps him upon the face, and eventually loses
animation. I do not know how the other two end, because they were not
home in time for the curtain. As it was, the Author-publisher nearly
spoilt one of the unities through waiting for them.

_Q._ All must be well that ends so well. Is there a problem or enigma?

_A._ There is always the insoluble riddle--why did he write it?

_Q._ Is it full of situations?

_A._ Not inconveniently so; but there is a dramatic moment.

_Q._ Which?

_A._ I do not know.

_Q._ Then why do you say there is one?

_A._ Because the Author-publisher says so.

_Q._ But is it not wasteful to have three acts, and only one dramatic
moment?

_A._ I should have thought so; but the Author-publisher says he has
shown economy.

_Q._ Could you give me an idea of the manner? Select a striking
incident or a passage where there is subtle characterisation.

_A._ One situation impressed me very much. I think it must have been
the dramatic moment. I reserve it for my next.

FILIA PULCHRA, MATER PULCHRIOR.

  I loved a girl, divinely sweet,
    An unsophisticated creature;
  I did not scruple to repeat
  She was divine, you could not meet
    More charms displayed in form and feature.

  I loved her youthful grace, her slight
    And dainty form, an angel's seeming.
  Crowned by sweet hair, as dark as night,
  Her face would charm an artist's sight,
    A poet's thoughts, a lover's dreaming.

  I loved her dark and lustrous eyes,
    Which love might light with glowing passion,
  Her lips, her neck--you will surmise
  I wrote her rhymes, all tears and sighs
    In lovesick versifier's fashion.

  I loved her like a childish pet,
    I felt I could not love another,
  Until the day when first I met
  Her widowed mother, charming yet,
    And now, instead, I love her mother.

  I love the woman, for the rose,
    Full blown, excels the rosebud's beauty,
  Nor think of girlish charms since those
  No more inspire my Muse, which shows
    My Muse is fit for any duty.

  I love her, stately as a queen
    Whom VERONESE might have painted,
  Blue-eyed, with hair of golden sheen--
  That's just the one thing which has been
    A trouble since we've been acquainted.

  I love not charms I loved before,
    Dark as the night, or, say a hearse is.
  Now auburn beauty pleases more,
  My wasted hours I deplore--
    I've had to alter all those verses.

EPPING AND OVERSTEPPING.--At a meeting of forest borderers, Wanstead,
it was asserted that since the Corporation had had control of the
forest, upwards of 100,000 trees had been felled. If true, the members

"those fellers!"

  The single task which, though divine

  Reluctantly I disobey
    Your positive injunction:
  Ask what you will, I'll undertake
    The deed, however big,

  You bring me back old scenes anew,

    The sweetest of all maids to me,
  Nor have I need of one at all,
  Yet, seeing you upon my wall,
    By pleasing "make-believe" I see
            Her pretty face!

BABY'S DIARY.

    ["The Nursery Tricycle contains two seats, one for the
    mistress and one for the maid and her charge, and has two
    pairs of pedals."--_Daily Paper._]

This is rather fun! Ever so much better than those crawling old
mail-carts and perambulators. Wonder mother and nurse never thought
of it before. A pneumatic tandem, too, I notice. Hope they understand
blowing tire up again when it bursts.

Nurse a duffer at pedalling. A mere passenger! Have to keep her up
to the mark by crying. Frightened a pony in a trap. Sarcastic driver
said, "_You_ don't want a bell to _your_ machine with that child
yelling like a tom-cat on fire." Gives me a hint--I must see how our
cat _does_ yell when it's on fire.

Really, I never saw such steering! Mother has just run us into a
brick wall. Disgraceful! Why wasn't she taught tricycling when she was
young? Her education has certainly been horribly neglected.

[Illustration]

Why should I sit in the middle, though? Can't see the country
properly. Make another protest--louder, if possible. Passing
pedestrian observes, "You should call your machine a crycycle, not
a tricycle." Put out my tongue at him. Nurse offers to give me a
"pick-a-back"; says she can pedal too! The old humbug! Scratch her
face. Mother offers me a seat on front handle. Not half bad.

Fresh air makes one uncommonly hungry. Time for my bottle. Insist on
my outriders stopping at a public for milk. Find the pony, trap, and
sarcastic driver stopping there too. Latter says to Mother, "So you've
brought the infant phenomenon with you, Ma'am!" Wonder what he means.
He adds something about a "fog-horn." Rude, I fancy.

Back homewards. Awfully sleepy after that milk. Curious milk. Perhaps
sarcastic person drugged it to quiet me? Fast asleep. Wakened by
crash! Stars! Oh, _what_ is it? Try to yell--can't--mouth full of
something.

Later. In my cot, thank Heaven! Heard doctor say, "Severe shock, but
no bones broken." Awful headache. Seems that break went wrong going
down-hill. Well, no "safety tandem" for _me_ again--can't _stand 'em_,
myself, not being in favour of infanticide. Give _me_ a good old mail
cart!

    feel called upon to safeguard our interests, but so far we

  AIR--"_The Heathen Chinee._"

  JOHN BULL _sings:_--

  I stand by, and I mark,
    And I see some things plain;
  And the looks that are dark
    At the JAP'S game, and gain,
  From that Heathen Chinee, are peculiar;
    But aloof _I_'m content to remain!

  AH SIN at the game
    Thought him chipper and spry;
  But he's "spoofed" all the same--
    (Whatsome'er _that_ imply)--
  And his smile is less pensive and childlike
    Than when he once played with BILL NYE.

  Little JAP _looked_ absurd--
    As regarding mere size--
  And some people inferred
    He was feeble likewise;
  Yet he's played it this time upon JOHNNY
    In a way it's scarce safe to despise.

  In the saffron pair's game
    I did not take a hand.
  Some conceived that the same
    JAP did not understand;
  But his grin somehow soon turned the tables
    On "the smile that was childlike and bland."

  'Tis a theme for BRET HARTE,
    P'raps he only could show
  The artful JAP'S art--
    If I may put it so--
  In a way which is worthy the subject.
    But _me_ interfere, gents? Why, no!

  If JAP'S cards had been stocked--
    Which I do not believe--
  Had our feelings been shocked
    By the state of JAP'S sleeve;
  We might have had reason for charging
    The same with intent to deceive.

  But the hands he has played
    With that Heathen Chinee,
  And the points he has made,
    Are, as far as I see,
  The result of good play _plus_ good fortune;
    And _does_ it concern you or me?

  The Russ standing by
    Turned his glance upon me.
  (For the JAP'S pile _was_ high.)
    And he hissed, "Shall this be?
  Must I have this smart JAP for a neighbour?
    Shall _he_ clear out the Heathen Chinee?"

  Swarthy FRANCOIS looked glum,
    Ginger HANS rubbed his chin:
  But I smoked and stood mum,
    As the JAP raked the tin.
  Then I says, "He's played fairly and squarely.
    So what call have _we_ to cut in?

  "In the game, as you know,
    You would not take a hand,
  But a short while ago;
    So let JAPPY now land
  The stakes, and AH SIN take his hiding
    At the game his foe _does_ understand.

  "JOHNNY thought himself strong
    At that game; but the facts
  Seem to prove he was wrong;
    And unwisely he acts
  In howling at getting in warfare
    What's frequent in warfare--that's whacks!

  "Which is why I remark,
    And my purpose is plain,
  That looks that are dark
    At the JAPPY are vain.
  And, although you may think me peculiar,
    Aloof--for the time--I remain!"

REMARKABLE INSTANCE OF SAGACITY IN GROUSE.

To _The Field_ of April 20, Mr. FREDERICK MILBANK wrote about the
"Monument to a Grouse Shooter" on Wimmergill Moor. Mr. MILBANK
considered the number of grouse he had bagged as constituting a
"record," and so caused a monument to be erected on the spot sacred to
the memory of four thousand brace of grouse shot in six days by five
guns with one extra gun on the sixth day. The monument, being erected,
_scared the grouse away_. Of course they read the sad story, held a
council, and decided that as long as F. A. MILBANK was anywhere
about, within shot, they would preserve themselves by avoiding him.
Subsequently the monument was removed to Bamingham in North Yorkshire.
But the North Yorkshire birds are quite indifferent to this tale
from The Hills. They wink the other eye, that is until such time as
FREDERICK A. MILBANK shall show them the sort of gun _he_ is, and then
they'll be sorry for not having taken warning earlier, unless they
possess the sagacity of the grouse of Wimmergill, which resembles
that of _Mr. Jingle's_ dog, who read the inscription on the board,
"Gamekeeper has orders to shoot all dogs found in this inclosure," and
"wouldn't pass it." "Singular circumstance that," said _Mr. Pickwick_.
"Will you allow me to make a note of it?"

THE MODERN BUYER:

GROWLS OF MODERN "MASTERS."

_Royal Academy, Burlington House, May 3, 1895._

  The "Old Masters" over, the New make a start.
    Another year's past and another year's come;
  And Fame blows a blast on her trumpet, and Art
              Beats her drum!

  "Walk Up!!" An example is set by the Court;
    And Society hastens--a feverish throng;
  A mere glance at the pictures, for life is but short--
              And Art's long!

  Three artists looked on with a cynical smile--
    One needy Outsider, and two rich R.A.'s
  (Both walking on velvet, because of the pile
              They could raise).

  They discussed the "Art Patron"--in all of that crowd
    An _avis_ that's _rara_ and _rara_ each year.
  And these are the words that they spoke, and allowed
              Me to hear:--

_First R.A._

  "Now, to none do I yield in my love of VANDYCK--
    I adore the Italians--bow down to the Dutch;
  VELASQUEZ I worship, and GOYA I like
              Very much.

  "But alas! for the SHEEPSHANKS and VERNONS of old--
    For the HILLS and the rest of a connoisseur race!
  Old MECAENAS has gone; and investors of gold
              Take his place."

_Second R.A._

  "'Old Masters' they buy--any ancient design--
    Eighteen-thirty or so is the latest they'll own;
  None but 'made reputations'--no work, howe'er fine,
              If unknown."

_Outsider._

  "Their Art's in their bankers'-books, not in their eyes
    To encourage the artist is none of their plan;
  They seek an investment that's likely to rise--
              To a man.

  "Do they think that fine art nowhere else can be seen
    But in saint that is squint-eyed, or boor that is drunk,
  In brown tree, Dutch canal, man with ruff, or the lean
              Spanish monk?"

_Second R.A._

  "Just reflect to what artists of old had been brought
    (Such as REYNOLDS, or RAPHAEL, or PHIDIAS the Greek)
  Had their patrons informed them they meant to buy nought
              But antique!"

_Outsider._

  "Then, _our_ drawing is better--our atmosphere too.
    _Plein air_ was ignored, or they voted it vice.
  As to '_values_,' 'twas little they thought of or knew--
              Save of price."

_First R.A._

  "When men buy modern art, they buy Leightons and Moores
    And Sargents and Swans and the rest of our lot;
  But as to their _knowledge_--like mine or like yours--
              Tommy rot!"

_Second R.A._

  "Do you think they appreciate LEWIS'S skies--
    Do they care if they're worked up in stipple or wash?
  Do you think it's the _Art_ (not the money) they prize?
              Simply bosh!"

_Outsider._

  "No. They judge not by Art--they judge only by fame;
    And the artist may starve on his poor pallet-bed;
  But their hundreds and thousands they shower on his name
              When he's dead!--

  "When the two Greatest Masters--Old Varnish and Time--
    To his work superficial beauties have lent,
  Lo behold, they appreciate! Be it so. _I'm_
              Quite content."

A FRIEND AT A PINCH.

(_An Utterly Impossible Incident that will never be "Reported."_)

    SCENE--_A Court of Law. Experienced Counsel arguing a point in
    the teeth of his Lordship on the Bench._

_His Lordship_ (_angrily_). No, Mr. BANDS, I really cannot agree with
you. It seems to me that you are merely wasting our time, and no doubt
your own.

_Experienced Counsel_ (_politely_). Not at all, my Lord. I scarcely
venture to urge the great importance of the matter to my client.

_His Lordship._ No doubt; and your client showed excellent judgment
in entrusting his interests to your hands. Still law is law, and can
never be anything else.

_Exp. C._ Your Lordship is most kind. But my point, my Lord, is so
plain--the matter is so clear. Surely your Lordship must see it.

_His Lordship_ (_with much irony_). It is my fault, no doubt, Mr.
BANDS, but as matter of fact your point is absolutely lost to me. I
confess I cannot see it at all.

_Exp. C._ I would not propose for a moment that your Lordship's
judgment is at fault. But I would venture to suggest that the
atmosphere of the Court is sufficiently dense to cloud the clearest
and most brilliant intellect.

_His Lordship_ (_mollified_). There is a good deal in what you say,
Mr. BANDS, but of course, we must put up with it. There is no remedy.

_Exp. C._ With every possible respect to the Bench, my Lord, I would
humbly suggest that there is a remedy.

_His Lordship._ Can you quote a case?

_Exp. C._ I can, at any rate, refer to an opinion.

_His Lordship._ Has it been reported?

_Exp. C._ Certainly, my Lord. You will find it in the Reports of the
Hardwicke Society. Lord Chief Justice RUSSELL OF KILLOWEN has laid
it down that snuff is a most valuable assistance to the proper
dispensation of justice. His Lordship has declared that the inhaling
of prepared tobacco through the nostrils "clears the judicial brain,
predisposes it to calmness and impartiality, and enables a learned
judge to listen with patience to the most fluent and prolific of
forensic orators." If your Lordship pleases.

    [_Offers snuff-box to the Judge._

_His Lordship_ (_after taking a pinch_). Well, certainly the point you
have raised seems clearer to me than it did. (_After a few moments of
consideration._) I will reserve the case for further consideration,
and will deliver judgment later.

_Exp. C._ As your Lordship pleases. I will ask the usher to hand my
authorities to your Lordship.

_His Lordship_ (_receiving snuff-box_). You are very good. I will
not overlook their assistance in coming to a conclusion. I hope the
occasion may never arise when I might be compelled, as the vulgar
tongue expresses it, to "give you snuff."

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.

_House of Commons, Monday, April 22._--Easter holidays over; school
back; new master in charge; process of installation a little lacking
in pomp and circumstance. This due in large measure to incidence of
holiday. At Westminster, as at other schools, boys don't insist, _vi
et armis_, on returning on the opening day. Wide gaps on most of the
benches; Front Opposition Bench a wilderness. PRINCE ARTHUR and all
his merrie men abstained from lending to installation of new Speaker
the grace and comfort of their presence.

"It is quite true, dear boy," PRINCE ARTHUR said, when I gently
hinted that the Leader of Opposition should have been present on such
occasion, "that when our man was defeated I said, Mr. WILLIAM
COURT GULLY having been elected by a majority of the House, is
representative of the whole House. But it's a long name, you know, and
in ordinary practice I must stop short at WILLIAM. You can't expect me
to COURT GULLY."

Amid depressing circumstances as far as attendance went, new Speaker
bore himself faultlessly. Quick-change process watched with breathless
interest from Ladies' Gallery. First, Speaker-Elect, preceded by Mace,
entered, attired in Court dress with close-fitting bob-wig. At summons
of Black Rod, proceeded to House of Lords; placed at Bar in custody of
Black Rod and Sergeant-at-Arms; not even "accommodated with a chair."
There to receive HER MAJESTY'S sanction of choice of Speaker made by
Commons. Happened that the QUEEN couldn't come. One of the cloaked and
wigged figures on Woolsack mentioned the matter in charmingly casual
way.

"It not being convenient for HER MAJESTY to be personally present
at this time," said a voice which bewrayed the LORD CHANCELLOR, "a
Commission has been issued under the Grand Seal empowering the
Lords named therein to convey Royal Assent to Commons' selection of
Speaker."

LORD CHANCELLOR quite friendly with Speaker-Elect, whom he familiarly
addressed as "Mr. GULLY." Spoke highly of his talents, diligence,
and sufficiency to fulfil important duties to which it had pleased
majority of Commons to call him. Said he had made it all right with
the QUEEN, and that WILLIAM COURT might go back to Commons, and get
about his business. SPEAKER, not to be outdone in geniality, begged
his anonymous friend, one of five muffled up in scarlet gowns, in
the event of any mess being made with matters in the other House, to
impute the blame to him alone, and let the other fellows go scot-free.

Amongst crowd of Commoners clustered behind SPEAKER there was scarcely
a dry eye when this noble sentiment was uttered.

"Solong!" said the voice that was certainly the LORD CHANCELLOR'S.
Taking this as hint to retire, SPEAKER withdrew from the Bar, and left
the House "Without a stain on his character," as the Earl of CORK and
ORRERY handsomely said. Returned to Commons in procession, with Mace
lightly but firmly carried by Sergeant-at-Arms. Instead of taking
Chair, marched round by passage to the rear, disappeared from view.
Consternation in Strangers' Gallery.

"He's bolted!" one gentleman whispered to his neighbour. "Funked it
when the music stopped and he came to the hosses."

After few moments of growing uneasiness, a fine figure, in
full-bottomed wig, silken gown, beneath which silver-buckled shoes
shimmered, emerged from behind SPEAKER'S Chair, and seated itself in
it. "Order! Order!" said a full, pleasant voice; and WILLIAM COURT
GULLY entered upon what promises to be a prosperous and distinguished
career.

SARK tells me that, on going into Committee of Supply, he intends to
move that henceforward the gallery over the Clock facing the Chair
shall be called "The Speaker's Gullery." SARK always thinks of the
right thing at the right time.

_Business done._--New Speaker installed.

_Tuesday._--The Order by which Ministers took Tuesdays having lapsed,
private Members to-night came into their own again. Always stoutly
resist incursion of greedy Governments on their small possessions.
Might reasonably be supposed that, having come into their inheritance,
would have made most of it. Lots of things to do to-night. Several
resolutions on paper, with Orders of Day to follow. What happened was
that by a quarter to nine enthusiasm finally evaporated; count called;
only thirty-seven Members responded; lights forthwith put out.

Opening debate on Charity Commission certainly a little heavy. Every
Member who got his chance felt it incumbent on him to speak for at
least half an hour. Some considerably exceeded this limit.

"_Parturiunt montes_," said HERBERT MAXWELL, wearily looking round
as GRIFFITH-BOSCAWEN followed JOHN ELLIS and JESSE COLLINGS succeeded
FRANCIS STEVENSON; "_nascitur ridiculus mus_."

And so it was. Particular mountain at work when the mouse appeared was
J. W. LOWTHER. Mouse entered from behind SPEAKER'S Chair; leisurely
proceeded along passage between Front Opposition Bench and table at
which J. W. was speaking disrespectfully of JESSE COLLINGS. Halted by
PRINCE ARTHUR'S empty seat; nibbled fibre of matting in remonstrance
at his absence; passed round fearlessly by J. W.'s heels; sat
for moment in full view of House listening attentively to J. W.'s
argument; yawned and sauntered back the way it came. Interest in
debate evidently keener than that of average Member. As soon as
ACLAND'S voice reverberated through almost empty Chamber, mouse
observed strolling back along familiar way; took its seat on floor
under shadow of Mace in defiance of all Parliamentary rule; followed
ACLAND'S argument with evidently keen interest. Interrupted by
approach of RICHARD TEMPLE. Quickly looking up and catching sight of
his stately figure bowing to SPEAKER, mouse fled like the wind, in its
terror making off by Treasury Bench, finally escaping by another exit.

"_Cogitato_" said HERBERT MAXWELL, who breakfasts every morning off a
plate of porridge and a page of PLAUTUS,--

  "Cogitato, mus pusillus quam sit sapiens bestia,
  AEtatem qui uni cubili nunquam committit suam."

_Business done._--Pension of L4,000 a year voted to ARTHUR WELLESLEY
PEEL, late Speaker.

[Illustration: Fancy Picture of Sir Thomas Esmonde bringing forward
Queen "Lily o' Killarney" Hawaii.]

_Thursday._--All very well for gay young Irish baronet like ESMONDE to
champion cause of errant Queens throned in summer seas. Expected other
things from THE MACGREGOR. House quite shocked when he interposed just
now. ESMONDE asked EDWARD GREY whether Government could do anything
to obtain proper treatment for Queen of Hawaii. Before Under Secretary
could reply, THE MACGREGOR, suddenly leaping across dyke as it were,
interposed. "As I happen to know the lady who was formerly Queen of
Hawaii," said THE MACGREGOR, and so proceeded to back up ESMONDE'S
plea. Offhand way in which reference was made suggested illimitable
possibilities, THE MACGREGOR just "happened to know" this Queen,
probably one of a bevy. On some quiet night House might hope to hear
paper read by THE MACGREGOR on "Queens I Have Known."

SARK curiously anxious as to where the acquaintance was made, and how
it was nurtured. Did THE MACGREGOR vaccinate Her Majesty whilst he,
still in public capacity, sojourned at Penrith? Was she an inmate of
Peebles Hydropathic Institute what time he was resident physician? or
did he minister to her at the Barnhill Hospital and Asylum, Glasgow,
of which, before he took to Imperial politics, he was superintendent?
Pleasanter still to think of THE MACGREGOR and the Queen with the
musical name wandering hand in hand amid the orange groves of sea-girt
Hawaii, breakfasting on the bountiful bread-fruit, lunching off the
succulent yam. Did he in those days call her so much as LILIUOKALANI?
or did he venture on the diminutive LILI? SARK had better give notice
of these questions. _Business done._--Fresh Ministerial Bills brought
in with both hands.

_Friday._--Another private Members' night, and, by consequence,
another count out. Things kept going till a quarter to eight, but
only with utmost difficulty. Members consented to stay in prospect
of division on ALBERT ROLLIT'S motion protesting against exemption
of Government property from rating. But they would not longer linger.
When LUBBOCK followed, with proposal of pleasant chat about London's
share of imperial contribution to local purposes, the few remaining
Members, vainly trying to look as if they'd be "back in ten minutes,"
walked out. House counted; only twenty-five present, and so home to
dinner.

"Yes, yes," said WALTER LONG, left in charge of Front Opposition
Bench, "but this won't prevent us on Monday, when SQUIRE OF MALWOOD
proposes to take Tuesday and Friday mornings for public business,
stubbornly resisting piratical incursion on the rights of private
Members. Whatever we are, let us be logical."

_Business done._--Ministerial defeat on ROLLIT'S amendment averted by
majority of one.

THE BATTLE OF EASTBOURNE.

  Natis in usum laetitiae rosis
  Pugnare Eastbourni est.

  HORACE (_slightly emended_).

It is not the English nature, but the English climate that makes us
take our pleasures sadly (if we do, which we don't). And it is not
the fault of the English nature, but of the organisers, if our public
pageants are usually, like our statues, more or less good-humoured
burlesques of what they are meant to represent. Now Eastbourne has
triumphantly shown that, in spite of chilling and heavy rain,
England can rival the sunny South in the beauty and variety of a big
procession of floral cars. And if Eastbourne can do this, why can it
not be done elsewhere? "Organise, organise, organise," and let the
hireling merrymaker be conspicuously absent. Your hireling will still
wear his armour as if he were bearing the _spolia opima_ of a burgled
marine-store dealer. And the lady hireling, as a sea-nymph or a
shepherdess, can never quite forget what she owes to her dignity as a
respectable married woman. In the interests of the family exchequer,
and in the way of business, she may consent to dally with allegory,
but her heart is not in the mermaid's grot, nor do the spacious times
of Great ELIZABETH inspire her, beyond the Victorian circus-smile,
the circus-smile which puts a girdle round about the face for
forty minutes, or more if the procession be so long a-field. At the
Eastbourne Battle of Flowers everyone lived up to his or her coach,
carriage, wheel-barrow or cart, in a way which speaks volumes for the
artistic sense of the South Saxons. The children, as children use,
took the cake--after Mr. EDGAR BRUCE. They were there in great numbers
and variety, from the little _Titania_ in her fairy goat-chaise, o'er
canopied with flowers and flying doves, to the very small skipper of
the very realistic ship, who stood on the rainy deck with drawn sword
and unswerving dignity for some two hours of constant and crowded
parading. "Bravo, BURNABY," is the resultant cry of gratified
spectators, and better weather next time. A better show it would be
ungrateful to suggest.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
