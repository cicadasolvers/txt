                         THE FIRST PART OF THE
                   BOOK OF HERMAS CALLED HIS VISION.


VISION I.

     1 Against filthy and proud thoughts;
     20 also the neglect of Hermas in chastising his children.

HE who had bred me up sold a
certain young maid at Rome;
whom when I saw many years
after, I remembered her, and
began to love her as a sister.
It happened some time afterwards,
that I saw her washing in the river.
Tyber; and I reached out my hand
unto her, and brought her out of
the river,

2  And when I saw her I thought
with myself, saying, How happy
should I be if I had such a wife,
both for beauty and manners.
This I thought with myself; nor
did I think any thing more. But
not long after, as I was walking,
and musing on these thoughts, I
began to honour this creature of
God, thinking with myself; how
noble and beautiful she was.

3  And when I had walked a little,
I fell asleep; and the spirit
caught me away, and carried me
through a certain place towards
the right hand, through which no
man could pass. It was a place
among rocks, very steep, and
unpassable for water.

4  When I was past this place,
I came into a plain; and there
falling down upon my knees, I
began to pray unto the Lord, and
to confess my sins.

5  And as I was praying, the
heaven was opened, and I saw the
woman which I had coveted,
saluting me from heaven, and
saying, Hermas, hail! and I looking
upon her, answered, Lady, what
dost thou do here? She answered
me, I am taken up hither to accuse
thee of sin before the Lord.

6  Lady, said I, wilt thou
convince me? No, said she: but
hear the words which I am about
to speak unto thee. God who
dwelleth in heaven, and hath made
all things out of nothing, and
hath multiplied them for his holy
church's sake, is angry with thee
because thou hast sinned against
me.

7  And I answering said unto
her, Lady, if I have sinned against
thee, tell me where, or in what
place, or when did I ever speak
an unseemly or dishonest word
unto thee?

8  Have I not always esteemed
thee as a lady? Have I not always
reverenced thee as a sister? Why
then dost thou imagine these
wicked things against me?

9  Then she, smiling upon me,
said: the desire of naughtiness
has risen up in thy heart. Does
it not seem to thee to be an ill
thing for a righteous man to have
an evil desire rise up in his heart.

10  It is indeed a sin, and that a
very great sin, to such a one; for
a righteous man thinketh that
which is righteous. And whilst
he does so, and walketh uprightly,
he shall have the Lord in heaven
favourable unto him in all his
business.

11  But as for those who think
wickedly in their hearts, they take
to themselves death and captivity;
and especially those who love this
present world, and glory in their
riches, and regard not the good
things that are to come; their
souls wander up and down and
know not where to fix.

12  Now this is the case of such
as are double-minded, who trust
not in the Lord, and despise and
neglect their own life.

13  But do thou pray unto the
Lord, and he will heal thy sins,
and the sins of thy whole house,
and of all his saints.

14  As soon as she had spoken
these words the heaven were shut,
and I remained utterly swallowed
up with sadness and fear: and
said within myself, if this be laid
against me for sin, how can I be
saved.

15  Or how should I ever be able
to entreat the Lord for my many
and great sins? With what words
shall I beseech him to be merciful
unto me?

16  As I was thinking over these
things, and meditating in myself
upon them, behold a chair was
set over against me of the whitest
wool, as bright as snow.

17  And there came an old woman
in a bright garment, having
a book in her hand, and sat alone,
and saluted me, saying, Hermas,
hail! and I being full of sorrow
and weeping, answered, Hail Lady!

18  And she said unto me, Why
art thou sad, Hermas, who wert
wont to be patient, and modest,
and always cheerful? I answered,
and said to her, Lady, a reproach
has been laid to my charge by an
excellent woman, who tells me
that I have sinned against her.

19  She replied, Far be any such
thing from the servant of God.
But it may be the desire of her
has risen up in thy heart? For
indeed such a thought maketh the
servants of God guilty of sin.

20  Nor ought such a detestable
thought to be in the servant of
God: nor should he who is approved
by the Spirit desire that which
is evil; but especially Hermas,
who contains himself from all
wicked lusts, and is full of all
simplicity, and of great innocence.

21  Nevertheless the Lord is
not so much angry with thee for
thine own sake, as upon the
account of thy house, which has
committed wickedness against the
Lord, and against their parents.

22  And for that out of thy
fondness towards thy sons, thou
hast not admonished thy house,
but hast permitted them to live
wickedly; for this cause the Lord
is angry with thee: but he will heal
all the evils that are done in thy
house. For through their sins
and iniquities, thou art wholly
consumed in secular affairs.

23  But now the mercy of God
hath taken compassion upon thee,
and upon thine house, and hath
greatly comforted thee. Only
as for thee, do not wander, but be
of an even mind, and comfort thy
house.

24  As the workman bringing
forth his work, offers it to
whomsoever he pleaseth; so shalt
thou by teaching every day what
is just, cut off a great sin.
Wherefore cease not to admonish thy
sons, for the Lord knows that they
will repent with all their heart,
and they shall be written in the
book of life.

25  And when she had said this,
she added unto me; Wilt thou
hear me read? I answered her,
Lady, I will.

26  Hear then, said she;
and opening the book she read,
gloriously, greatly. and wonderfully,
such things as I could not keep in
my memory. For they were terrible
words, such as no man could bear.

27  How it be I committed her
last words to my remembrance;
for they were but few, and of great
use to us:--

28  Behold the mighty Lord, who
by his invisible power, and with
his excellent wisdom made the
world, and by his glorious counsel
beautified his creature, and with
the word of his strength fixed the
heaven, and founded the earth
upon the waters; and by his
powerful virtue established the
Holy Church, which he hath
blessed.

29  Behold he will remove the
heavens, and the mountains, the
hills, and the seas; and all things
shall be made plain for his elect;
that he may render unto them the
promise which he has promised,
with much honour and joy; if so
be that they shall keep the
commandments of God, which they
have received with great faith.

30  And when she had made an end
of reading, she rose out of the
chair; and behold four young men
came, and carried the chair to
the east.

31  And she called me unto her,
and touched my breast, and said
unto me, Did my reading please
thee? I answered, Lady, these
last things please me; but what
went before was severe and hard.

32  She said unto me, these last
things are for the righteous, but
the foregoing for the revolters and
heathen.

33  And as she was talking with
me, two men appeared, and took
her upon their shoulders, and
went to the east where the chair
was.

34  And she went cheerfully
away; and as she was going, said
unto me, Hermas, be of good
cheer.



VISION II.

     Again, of his neglect in correcting his talkative wife;
     and of his lewd sons.

AS I was on the way to Cuma,
about the same time that I
went the year before, I began to
call to mind the vision I formerly
had. And again the spirit carried
me away, and brought me into the
same place, in which I had been
the year before.

2  And when I was come into the
place, I fell down upon my knees,
and began to pray unto the Lord,
and to glorify his name, that he
had esteemed me worthy, and had
manifested unto me my former
sins.

3  And when I arose from prayer,
behold I saw over against me the
old woman whom I had seen the
last year, walking and reading
in a certain book.

4  And she said unto me, Canst
thou tell these things to the
elect of God? I answered and said
unto her, Lady, I cannot retain
so many things in my memory, but
give me the book, and I will write
them down.

5  Take it, says she, and see that
thou restore it again to me.

6  As soon as I had received it,
I went aside into a certain place
of the field, and transcribe every
letter, for I found no syllables.

7  And as soon as I had finished
what was written in the book, the
book was suddenly caught out of
my hand, but by whom I saw not.

8  After fifteen days, when I
had fasted, and entreated the Lord
with all earnestness, the knowledge
of the writing was revealed unto me.
Now the writing was this:--

9  Thy seed, O Hermas! hath
sinned against the Lord, and have
betrayed their parents, through
their great wickedness. And they
have been called the betrayers of
their parents, and have gone on in
their treachery.

10  And now have they added
lewdness to their other sins, and
the pollutions of their naughtiness:
thus have they filled up the measure
of their iniquities. But do thou
upbraid thy sons with all these
words; and thy wife, who shall be
as thy sister; and let her learn
to refrain her tongue, with which
she calumniates.

11  And when she shall hear these
things, she will refrain herself,
and shall obtain mercy.

12  And they also shall be
instructed, when thou shalt have
reproached them with these words,
which the Lord has commanded to
be revealed unto them.

13  Then shall their sins be
forgiven, which they have heretofore
committed, and the sins of all the
saints who have sinned even unto
this day; if they shall repent with
all their hearts, and remove all
doubts out of their hearts.

14  For the Lord hath sworn by
his glory concerning his elect,
having determined this very time,
that if any one shall even now
sin, he shall not be saved.

15  For the repentance of the
righteous has its end; the days of
repentance are fulfilled to all the
saints; but to the heathen, there
is repentance even unto the last
day.

16  Thou shalt therefore say to
those who are over the church,
that they order their ways in
righteousness; so that they may
fully receive the promise with
much glory.

17  Stand fast therefore ye that
work righteousness and continue
to do it, that your departure may
be with the holy angels.

18  Happy are ye, as many as
shall endure the great trial that is
at hand, and whosoever shall not
deny his life.

19  For the Lord hath sworn by
his Son, that whoso, denieth his
Son and HIM, being afraid of his
life, he will also deny him in the
world that is to come.

20  But those who shall never
deny him, he will of his exceeding
great mercy be favourable unto
them.

21 But thou, O Hermas! remember
not the evils which thy sons have
done, neither neglect thy sister,
but take care that they amend of
their former sins.

22  For they will be instructed
by this doctrine, if thou shalt not
be mindful of what they have done
wickedly.

23  For the remembrance of evils
worketh death, but the forgetting
of them eternal life.

24  But thou, O Hermas! hast
undergone a great many worldly
troubles for the offences of thy
house, because thou hast neglected
them, as things that did not belong
unto thee; and thou art wholly
taken up with thy great business.

25  Nevertheless, for this cause
shalt thou be saved, that thou hast
not departed from the living God,
and thy simplicity and singular
continency shall preserve thee, if
thou shalt continue in them.

26  Yes, they shall save all such
as do such things, and walk in
innocence and simplicity.

27 They who are of this kind
shall prevail against all impiety,
and continue until life eternal.

28  Happy are all they that do
righteousness, they shall not be
consumed for ever.

29  But thou wilt say, Behold
there is a great trial coming. If
it seem good to thee, deny him
again.

30  The Lord is nigh to them that
turn to him, as it is written in
the book of Heldam and Modal,
who prophesied to the people of
Israel in the wilderness.

31  Moreover, brethren, it was
revealed to me, as I was sleeping,
by a very goodly young man, saying
unto me, What thinkest thou of that
old woman from whom thou receivedst
the book; who is she? I answered,
a Sybil.

32  Thou art mistaken said he,
she is not. I replied, Who is she
then, sir? He answered me, It is
the church of God.

33  And I said unto him, Why
then does she appear old? She is
therefore, said he, an old woman,
because she was the first of all
the creation, and the world was
made for her.

34  After this I saw a vision at
home in my own house, and the
old woman, whom I had seen before,
came to me and asked me whether
I had yet delivered her book to
the elders of the church? And
I answered, that I had not yet.

35  She replied, Thou hast well
done, for I have certain words
more to tell thee. But when I
shall have finished all the words,
they shall be clearly understood
by the elect.

36 And thou shalt write two
books, and send one to Clement
and one to Grapte. For Clement
shall send it to the foreign cities,
because it is permitted to him so
to do: but Grapte shall admonish
the widows and orphans.

37  But thou shalt read in this
city with the elders of the church.



VISION III.

     Of the building of the church triumphant,
     and of the several sorts of reprobates.

THE vision which I saw, brethren,
was this.

2  When I had often fasted and
prayed unto the Lord, that he
would manifest unto me the
revelation, which he had promised
by the old woman to show unto me;
the same night she appeared unto
me, and said unto me,

3  Because thou dost thus afflict
thyself, and art so desirous to know
all things, come into the field,
where thou wilt, and about the
sixth hour, I will appear unto thee,
and show thee what thou must
see.

4  I asked her, saying; Lady,
into what part of the field? She
answered, wherever thou wilt, only
choose a good and a private place.
And before I began to speak and
tell her the place, she said unto
me; I will come where thou wilt.

5  I was therefore, brethren in
the field and I observed the hours,
and came into the place where I
had appointed her to come.

6  And I beheld a bench placed;
it was a linen pillow, and over it
spread a covering of fine linen.

7  When I saw these things ordered
in this manner, and that there was
nobody in the place, I began to be
astonished, and my hair stood on end,
and a, kind of horror seized me;
for I was alone.

8  But being come to myself,
and calling to mind the glory of
God, and taking courage, I fell
down upon my knees and began
again to confess my sins as before.

9  And whilst I was doing this,
the old woman came thither with
the six young men whom I had
seen before, and stood behind me
as I was praying, and heard me
praying and confessing my sins
unto the Lord.

10  And touching me, she said;
Leave off praying now only for thy
sins; pray also for righteousness,
that thou mayest receive a part of
it in thy house.

11  And she lifted me up from
the place, and took me by the
hand, and brought me to the seat;
and said to the young men, go,
and build.

12  As soon as they were departed,
and we were alone, she said unto me;
sit here. I answered her; Lady,
let those who are elder sit first.
She replied, Sit down as I bid you.

13  And when I would have sat
on the right side, she suffered me
not, but made a sign to me with
her hand, that I should sit on the
left.

14  As I was therefore musing,
and full of sorrow, that she would
not suffer me to sit on the right
side, she said unto me, Hermas,
why art thou sad?

15  The place which is on the
right hand is theirs who have
already attained unto God, and have
suffered for his name-sake. But
there is yet a great deal remaining
unto thee, before thou canst sit
with them.

16  But continue as thou doest,
in thy sincerity, and thou shalt sit
with them; as all others shall,
who do their works, and shall bear
what they have borne.

17  I said to her; Lady, I would
know what it is that they have
suffered? Hear then, said she:
wild beasts, scourgings,
imprisonments, and crosses
for his name-sake.

18  For this cause the right hand
of holiness belongs to them, and
to all others as many as shall
suffer for the name of God; but
the left belongs to the rest.

19  Howbeit the gifts and the
promises belong to both, to them
on the right, and to those on the
left hand; only that sitting on the
right hand they have some glory
above the others.

20  But thou art desirous to sit
on the right hand with them, and
yet thy defects are many. But
thou shalt be purged from thy
defects, as also all who doubt not
shall be cleansed from all the sins
which they have committed unto
this day.

21  And when she had said this
she would have departed.

22  Wherefore, falling down before
her feet, I began to entreat her,
for the Lord's sake, that she
would show me the vision which
she had promised.

23  Then she again took me by
the hand, and lifted me up, and
made me sit upon the seat at the
left side; and holding up a certain
bright wand, said unto me, Seest
thou that great thing? I replied,
Lady, I see nothing.

24  She answered, Dost thou not
see over against thee a great tower,
which is built upon the water with
bright square stones?

25  For the tower was built upon
a square by these six young men
that came with her.

26  But many thousand of other
men brought stones; some drew
them out of the deep, others
carried them from the ground,
and gave them to the six young men;
and they took them and built.

27  As for those stones which
were drawn out of the deep, they
put them all into the building;
for they were polished, and their
squares exactly answered one another,
and so one was joined in such wise
to the other, that there was no
space to be seen where they
joined, insomuch that the whole
tower appeared to be built as it
were of one stone.

28  But as for the other stones
that were taken off from the
ground, some of them they rejected,
others they fitted into the building.

29  As for those which were rejected,
some they cut out, and cast them
at a distance from the tower;
but many others of them lay round
about the tower, which they made
no use of in the building.

30  For some of these were
rough, others had clefts in them,
others were white and round, not
proper for the building of the
tower.

31  But I saw the other stones
cast afar off from the tower, and
falling into the high-way, and yet
not continuing in the way, but
were rolled from the way into a
desert place.

32  Others I saw falling into the
fire and burning; others fell near
the water, yet could not roll
themselves into it, though very
desirous to fall into the water.

33  And when she had showed
me these things she would have
departed; but I said to her, Lady,
what doth it profit me to see these
things, and not understand what
they mean?

34  She answered and said unto
me; You are very cunning, in
that you are desirous to know
those things which relate to the
tower. Yea, said I, lady, that I
may declare them unto the brethren,
and they may rejoice, and hearing
these things may glorify God
with great glory.

35  Then she said, Many indeed
shall hear them, and when they
shall have heard them, some shall
rejoice, and others weep. And
yet even these, if they shall
repent, shall rejoice too.

36  Hear therefore what I shall
say concerning the parable of the
tower, and after this be no longer
importunate with me about the
revelation.

37  For these revelations have
an end, seeing they are fulfilled.
But thou dost not leave off to
desire revelations, for thou art
very urgent.

38  As for the tower which thou
seest built, it is myself, namely,
the church, which have appeared
to thee both now and heretofore.
Wherefore ask what thou wilt
concerning the tower, and I will
reveal it unto thee, that thou
mayest rejoice with the saints.

39  I said unto her, Lady,
because thou hast thought me once
worthy to receive from thee the
revelation of all these things,
declare them unto me.

40  She answered me, Whatsoever
is fit to be revealed unto thee
shall be revealed: only yet thy
heart be with the Lord, and doubt
not, whatsoever thou shalt see.

41  I asked her, Lady, why is the
tower built upon the water? She
replied, I said before to thee that
thou wert very wise to inquire
diligently concerning the building,
therefore thou shalt find the truth.

42  Hear therefore why the tower
is built upon the water: because
your life is and shall be saved by
water. For it is founded by the
word of the almighty and honourable
name, and is supported by the
invisible power and virtue of God.

43 And I answering, said
unto her, These things are very
admirable; but, lady, who are
those six young men that build?

44  They are, said she, the angels
of God, who were first appointed,
and to whom the Lord has delivered
all his creatures, to frame and
build them up, and to rule over
them. For by these the building
of the tower shall be finished.

45  And who are the rest who
bring them stones?

46  They also are the holy angels
of the Lord; but the others are
more excellent than these. Wherefore
when the whole building of the
tower shall be finished, they
shall all feast together beside
the tower, and shall glorify God,
because the structure of the
tower is finished.

47  I asked her, saying, I would
know the condition of the stones,
and what the meaning of them
is?

48  She answering, said unto
me, Art thou better than all others
that this should be revealed unto
thee? For others are both before
thee and better than thou art,
to whom these visions should be
made manifest.

49  Nevertheless, that the name
of God may be glorified, it has been
shown and shall be revealed unto
thee, for the sake of those who are
doubtful, and think in their hearts
whether these things are so or not.

50  Tell them that all these
things are true, and that there is
nothing in them that is not true
but all are firm and truly
established.

51  Hear now then concerning
the stones that are in the building.

52  The square and white stones
which agree exactly in their joints,
are the apostles, and bishops, and
doctors, and ministers, who
through the mercy of God have
come in, and governed, and taught
and ministered holily and modestly
to the elect of God, both they
that have fallen asleep, and which
yet remain; and have always
agreed with them, and have had
peace within themselves, and have
heard each other.

53  For which cause their joints
exactly meet together in the building
of the tower.

54  They which are drawn out
of the deep and put into the
building, and whose joints agree
with the other stones which are
already built, are those which are
already fallen asleep, and have
suffered for the sake of the Lord's
name.

55  And what are the other
stones, lady, that are brought
from the earth? I would know
what are they.

56  She answered, They which
lie upon the ground and are not
polished, are those which God has
approved, because they have
walked in I the law of the Lord,
and directed their ways in his
commandments.

57 They which are brought and
put in the building of the tower,
are the young in faith and the
faithful. And these are admonished
by the angels to do well because
iniquity is not found in them.

58  But who are those whom they
rejected, and laid beside the tower?

59  They are such as have sinned
and are willing to repent; for
which cause they are not cast far
from the tower, because they will
be useful for the building, if they
shall repent.

60  They therefore that are yet
to repent, if they repent they shall
become strong in the faith; that
is, if they repent now, whilst the
tower is building. For if the
building shall be finished there
will then be no place for them to
be put in, but they shall be rejected;
for he only has this privilege who
shall now be put into the tower.

61   But would you know who
they are that were cut out, and
cast afar off from the tower?
Lady said I, I desire it.

62  They are the children of iniquity,
who believed only in hypocrisy,
and departed not from  their evil
ways; for this cause they shall not
be saved, because they are not of
any use in the building by reason
of their sins.

63 Wherefore they are cut out,
and cast afar off, because of the
anger of the Lord, and because
they have provoked him to anger
against them.

64  As for the great number of
other stones which thou hast seen
placed about the tower, but now
put into the building; those which
are rugged, are they who have
known the truth, but have not
continued in it, nor been joined
to the saints, and therefore are
unprofitable.

65  Those that have clefts in
them, are they that keep up discord
in their hearts against each other,
and live not in peace; that are
friendly when present with their
brethren, but as soon as they are
departed from one another, their
wickedness still continues in
their hearts: these are the clefts
which are seen in those stones.

66  Those that are maimed and
short, are they who have believed
indeed, but still are in great
measure full of wickedness; for
this cause they are maimed and
not whole.

67  But what are the white and
round stones, lady, and which are
not proper for the building of the
tower?

68  She answering said unto
me: How long wilt thou continue
foolish and without understanding,
asking everything and discerning
nothing?

69  They are such as have faith
indeed, but have withal the riches
of this present world. When
therefore any troubles arise, for
the sake of their riches and traffic,
they deny the Lord.

70  I answering, said unto her,
When therefore will they be
profitable to the Lord? When their
riches shall be cut away, says she,
in which they take delight, then
they will be profitable unto the
Lord for his building.

71  For as a round stone, unless
it be cut away and is cast somewhat
of its bulk, cannot be made square,
so they who are rich in this world;
unless their riches be pared off;
cannot be made profitable unto the
Lord.

72  Learn this from thy own
experience: when thou wert rich,
thou wast unprofitable; but now
thou art profitable, and fit for the
life which thou hast undertaken;
for thou also once was one of
those stones.

73 As for the rest of the stones
which thou sawest cast afar
off from the tower, and running in
the way, and tumbled out of the
way into desert places; they are
such as have believed indeed,
but through their doubting have
forsaken the true way, thinking that
they could find a better. But they
wander and are miserable, going
into desolate ways.

74  Then for those stones which
fell into the fire and were burnt,
they are those who have for ever
departed from the living God;
nor doth it ever come into their
hearts to repent, by reason of the
affection which they bear to their
lusts and wickedness which they
commit.

75  And what are the rest which
fell by the water, and could not
roll into the water?

76  They are such as have heard
the word, and were willing to be
baptised in the name of the Lord;
but considering the great holiness
which the truth requires, have
withdrawn themselves, an walked
again after wicked lusts.

77  Thus she finished the
explanation of the tower.

78 But I being still urgent,
asked her, Is there repentance
allowed to all those stones which
are thus cast away, and were not
suitable to the building of the
tower; and shall they find place
in this tower?

79  They may repent, said she,
yet they cannot come into this
tower; but, they shall be placed
in a much lower rank, and then
only after they shall have been
afflicted and fulfilled the days of
their sins.

80  And for this cause they shall
be removed, because they have
received the word of righteousness:
and then they shall be translated
from their afflictions, if they
shall have a true sense in their
hearts of what they have done amiss.

81  But if they shall not have
this sense in their hearts, they
shall not be saved by reason of
the hardness of their hearts.

82  When therefore I had done
asking her concerning all these
things, she said unto me, Wilt
thou see something else? And
being desirous of seeing it,
I became very cheerful of
countenances.

83  She therefore looking back
upon me, and smiling a little, said
unto me, Seest thou seven women
about the tower? Lady, said I,
I see them.

84  This tower, replied she, is
supported by them, according to
the command of the Lord: hear
therefore the effects of them.

85  The first of them, which
holds fast with her hand, is called
Faith; The next, which is girt
up, and looks manly, is named
Abstinence: she is the daughter
of Faith.

86  Whosoever therefore shall
follow her shall be happy in all
his life, because he shall abstain
from all evil works, believing that
if he shall contain himself from
all concupiscence, he shall be
the heir of eternal life. And
what, lady, said I, are the other
five?

87  They are, replied she, the
daughters of one another. The
first of them is called Simplicity;
the next Innocence; the third
Modesty; then Discipline; and
the last of all is Charity. When
therefore thou shalt have fulfilled
the works of their mother, thou
shalt be able to do all things.

88  Lady, said I, I would know
what particular virtue every one
of these has.

89  Hear then, replied she;
they have equal virtues, and their
virtues are knit together, and
follow one another as they were
born.

90  From Faith proceeds Abstinence;
from Abstinence, Simplicity; from
Simplicity, Innocence; from Innocence,
Modesty; from Modesty, Discipline
and Charity. Therefore the works
of these are holy, and chaste, and
right.

91  Whoever therefore shall
serve these, and hold fast to their
works, he shall have his dwelling
in the tower with the saints of
God.

92  Then I asked her concerning
the times, whether the end were
now at hand?

93  But she cried out with a loud
voice, saying, O foolish man!
Dost thou not see the tower yet a
building? When therefore the
tower shall be finished, and built,
it shall have an end; and indeed
it shall soon be accomplished.

94  But do not ask me any more
questions. What has been said
may suffice thee and all the saints
for the refreshment of your spirits.
For these things have not been
revealed to thee only, but that
thou mayest make them manifest
unto all.

95  For therefore, O Hermas,
after three days thou must understand
these words which I begin
to speak unto thee, that thou
mayest speak them in the ears of
the saints; that when thou shall
have heard and done them, they
may be cleansed from their
iniquities, and thou together
with them.

96  Hear me therefore, O my
sons! I have bred you up in much
simplicity, and innocency, and
modesty, for the love of God,
which has dropped down upon
you in righteousness, that you
should be sanctified and justified
from all sin and wickedness; but
ye will not cease from your evil
doings.

97  Now therefore hearken unto
me, and have peace one with another,
and visit one another, and receive
one another, and do not enjoy
the creatures of God alone.

98  Give freely to them that are
in need. For some by too free
feeding contract an infirmity in
their flesh, and do injury to their
bodies; whilst the flesh of others,
who have not food, withers away,
because they want sufficient
nourishment, and the bodies are
consumed.

99  Wherefore this intemperance
is hurtful to you, who have, and
do not contribute to them that
want. Prepare for the judgment
that is about to come upon you.

100  Ye that are the more eminent,
search out them that are hungry,
whilst the tower is yet unfinished.
For when the tower shall be finished,
ye shall be willing to do good,
and shall not find any place in it.

101  Beware, therefore, ye that
glory in your riches, lest perhaps
they groan who are in want, and
their sighing come up unto God,
and ye be shut out with your goods
without the gate of the tower.

102  Behold I now warn you who
are set over the church, and love
the highest seats, be not ye like
unto those that work mischief.

103  And they indeed carry about
their poison in boxes, but ye
contain your poison and infection
in your hearts, and will not purge
them, and mix your sense with a
pure heart, that ye might find
mercy with the Great King.

104  Take heed, my children,
that your dissensions deprive you
not of your lives. How will ye
instruct the elect of God, when
ye yourselves want correction?
Wherefore admonish one another,
and be at peace among yourselves,
that I, standing before your
Father, may give an account
of you unto the Lord.

105  And when she had made
an end of talking with me, the six
young men that built, came and
carried her to the tower; and four
others took up the seat on which
she sat, and they also went away
again to the tower. I saw not the
faces of these, for their backs
were towards me.

106  As she was going away, I
asked her, that she would reveal
to me what concerned the three
forms, in which she had appeared
unto me.

107  But she answering said unto
me, concerning these things
thou must ask some other, that
they may be revealed unto thee.

108  Now, brethren, in the first
vision the last year, she appeared
unto me exceedingly old, and
sitting in a chair.

109  In another vision, she had
indeed a youthful face, but her
flesh and hair were old; but she
talked with me standing, and was
more cheerful than the first time.

110  In the third vision, she was
in all respects much younger, and
comely to the eye; only she had
the hair of an aged person: yet
she looked cheerful, and sat upon
a seat.

111  I was therefore very sad
concerning these things, until I
might understand the vision.

112  Wherefore I saw the same
old woman in a vision of the night
saying unto me, All prayer needeth
humiliation. Fast, therefore, and
thou shalt learn from the Lord
that which thou dost ask. I fasted
therefore one day.

113  The same night a young
man appeared to me and said,
Why dost thou thus often desire
Revelations in thy prayers? Take
heed that by asking many things,
thou hurt not the body. Let these
Revelations suffice thee.

114  Canst thou see more notable
Revelations than those which
thou hast already received?

115  I answered and said unto
him, Sir, I only ask this one
thing upon the account of the
three figures of the old woman
that appeared to me, that the
Revelation may be complete.

116  He answered me, You are
not without understanding, but
your doubts make you so; for as
much as you have not your heart
with the Lord.

117  I replied and said, But we
shall learn these things more
carefully from you.

118  Hear then, says he, concerning
the figures about which you inquire.

119  To begin; in the first vision
she appeared to thee in the shape
of an old woman sitting in, a chair,
because your old spirit was decayed,
and without strength, by reason
of your infirmities, and the
doubtfulness of your heart.

120  For as they who are old
have no hope of renewing
themselves, nor expect any thing
but their departure; so you being
weakened through your worldly
affairs gave yourself up to sloth,
and cast not away your solicitude
from yourself upon the Lord: and
your sense was confused, and you
grew old in your sadness.

121  But, sir, I would know why
she sat upon a chair?

122  He answered, because every
one that is weak sitteth upon a
chair by reason of his infirmity,
that his weakness may be upheld.
Behold therefore the figure of the
first vision.

123  In the second vision you
saw her standing, and having a
youthful face, and more cheerful
than her former; but her flesh
and her hair were ancient. Hear,
said he, this parable also.

124  When any one grows old,
he despairs of himself by reason
of his infirmity and poverty, and
expects nothing but the last day of
his life.

125  But on a sudden an inheritance
is left to him, and he hears of it,
and rises: and being become
cheerful, be puts on new strength.
And now he no longer sits down,
but stands, and is delivered from
his former sorrow; and sits not,
but acts manfully.

126  So you, having heard the
Revelation which God revealed
unto you, because God had
compassion upon you, and renewed
your spirit, both laid aside your
infirmities, and strength came to
you, and you grew strong in the
faith; and God, seeing your
strength, rejoiced.

127  For this cause he showed
you the building of the tower,
and will show other things unto you,
if you shall have peace with all
your heart among each other.

128  But in the third vision you
saw her yet younger, fair and
cheerful, and of a serene
countenance.

129  For, as if some good news
comes to him that is sad, he
straightway forgets his sadness,
and regards nothing else but the
good news which he has heard;
and for the rest he is comforted,
and his spirit is renewed through
the joy which he has received
even so you have been refreshed
in your spirit by seeing these good
things.

130  And for that you saw her
sitting upon a bench, it denotes a
strong position; because a bench
has four feet, and stands strongly.
And even the world itself is upheld
by the four elements.

131  They therefore that repent
perfectly, shall be young; and
they that turn from their sins
with their whole heart, shall
be established.

132  And now you have the
Revelation fully, ask no more
to have any thing farther
revealed unto you.

133  But if any thing is to be
revealed, it shall be made manifest
unto you.



VISION IV.

     Of the trial, and tribulation that is about
     to come upon men.

I SAW a vision brethren, twenty
days after the former vision;
a representation of the tribulation
that is at hand. I was walking in
the field way.

2  Now from the public way to
the place whither I went is about
ten furlongs; it is a way very
little frequented:

3  And as I was walking alone, I
entreated the Lord that he would
confirm the Revelations which he
had shown unto me by his Holy
Church.

4  And would grant repentance
to all his servants who had been
offended, that his great and
honourable name might be glorified,
and because he thought me worthy
to whom he might show his wonders,
and, that I might honour him,
and give thanks unto him.

5  And behold somewhat like a
voice answered me; Doubt not,
Hermas. Wherefore I began to
think, and say within myself, why
should I doubt, seeing I am thus
settled by the Lord, and have seen
such glorious things?

6  I had gone but a little farther,
brethren, when behold I saw a
dust rise up to heaven. I began
to say within myself, is there a
drove of cattle coming, that rises
such a dust?

7  It was about a furlong off from
me. And behold I saw the dust
rise more and more, insomuch that
I began to suspect that there was
somewhat extraordinary in it.

8  And the sun shone a little;
and behold I saw a great beast, as
it were a whale; and fiery locusts
came out of his mouth. The height
of the beast was about a hundred
feet, and he had a head like a
large earthen vessel.

9  I began to weep, and to pray
unto the Lord that he would deliver
me from it. Then I called to mind
the word which I had heard;
Doubt not, Hermas.

10  Wherefore, brethren, putting
on a divine faith, and remembering
who it was that had taught me great
things, I delivered myself bodily
unto the beast.

11  Now the beast came on in
such a manner, as if it could at
once have devoured a city.

12  I came near unto it, and the
beast extended its whole bulk upon
the ground, and put forth nothing
but its tongue, nor once moved itself
till I had quite passed by it.

13  Now the beast had upon its
head four colours; first black,
then a red and bloody colour, then
a golden, and then a white.

14  After that I had passed by
it, and was gone forward about
thirty feet, behold there met me a
certain virgin, well adorned as if
she had been just come out of her
bride-chamber; all in white, having
on white shoes, and a veil down her
face, and covered with shining hair.

15  Now I knew by my former
visions that it was the church,
and thereupon grew the more cheerful.
She saluted me, saying, Hail, O Man!
I returned the salutation, saying,
Lady, Hail!

16  She answering said unto me,
Did nothing meet you, O man!
I replied, Lady, there met me such
a beast, as seemed able to devour
a whole people; but by the power
of God, and through his singular
mercy, I escaped it.

17  Thou didst escape it well,
said she, because thou didst cast
thy whole care upon God, and
opened thy heart unto him,
believing that thou couldst be safe
by no other than by his great and
honourable name.

18  For this cause the Lord sent
his angel, who is over the beast,
whose name is Hegrin, and stopped
his mouth, that he should not
devour thee, Thou hast escaped
a great trial through thy faith, and
because thou didst not doubt for
such a terrible beast.

19  Go, therefore, and relate to
the elect of God the great things
that he hath done for thee. And
thou shalt say unto them, that this
beast is the figure of the trial that
is about to come.

20  If, therefore, ye shall have
prepared yourselves, ye may escape
it, if your hearts be pure and
without spot; and if ye shall serve
God all the rest of your days
without complaint.

21  Cast all your care upon the
Lord, and he will direct them.
Believe in God, ye doubtful,
because he can do all things;
he can both turn away his wrath
from you, and send you help and
security.

22  Woe to the doubtful, to those
who shall hear these words, and
shall despise them: it had been
better for them that they had not
been born.

23  Then I asked her concerning
the four colours which the beast
had upon its head. But she
answered me saying; Again thou
art curious in that thou asketh
concerning these things. But I
said to her, Lady, chew me what
they are?

24  Hear, said she; The black
which thou sawest denotes the
world in which you dwell. The
fiery and bloody colour signifies
that this age must be destroyed
by fire and blood.

25  The golden part are ye, who
have escaped out of it; for as gold
is tried by the fire, and is made
profitable, so are ye also in like
manner tried who dwell among the
men of this world.

26  They therefore, that shall
endure to the end, and be proved
by them, shall be purged. And as
gold, by this trial, is cleansed
and loses its dross, so shall ye
also cast away all sorrow and
trouble, and be made pure for
the building of the tower.

27  But the white colour denotes
the time of the world which is to
come, in which the elect of God
shall dwell: because the elect of
God shall be pure and without
spot until life eternal.

28  Wherefore do not thou cease
to speak these thing in the ears of
the saints. Here ye have the figure
of the great tribulation that is
about to come; which, if you
please, shall be nothing to you.

29  When she had spoken thus
much, she departed; but I saw
not whither she went. But suddenly
I heard a noise, and I turned
back, being afraid, for I thought
that the beast was coming toward
me.






                         THE SECOND PART OF THE
                  BOOK OF HERMAS, CALLED HIS COMMANDS.


Introduction.

WHEN I had prayed at home,
and was sat down upon the
bed, a certain man came in to me
with a reverend look, in the habit
of a Shepherd, clothed with a white
cloak, having his bag upon his
back, and his staff in his hand, and
saluted me.

2  I returned his salutation, and
immediately he sat down by me,
and said unto me, I am sent by
that venerable messenger, that
I should dwell with thee all the
remaining days of thy life.

3  But I thought that he was
come to try me, and said unto him,
Who are you? For I know to
whom I am committed. He said
unto me, Do you not know me?
I answered no. I am, said he,
that shepherd to whose care you
are delivered.

4  Whilst he was yet speaking,
his shape was changed; and when
I knew that it was he to whom I
was committed, I was ashamed,
and a sudden fear came upon me,
and I was utterly overcome with
sadness, because I had spoken so
foolishly unto him.

5  But he said unto me, Be not
ashamed, but receive strength in
thy mind, through the commands
which I am about to deliver unto
thee. For, said he, I am sent to
show unto thee all those things
again, which thou hast seen before,
but especially such of them as may
be of most use unto thee.

6  And first of all write my
Commands and Similitudes, the rest
thou shall so write as I shall show
unto thee. But I therefore bid
thee first of all write my Commands
and Similitudes, that by often
reading of them thou mayest
the more easily keep them in
memory.

7  Whereupon I wrote his Commands
and Similitudes, as he bade me.

8  Which things if when you
have heard, ye shall observe to do
them, and shall walk according to
them, and exercise yourselves in
them with a pure mind, ye shall
receive from the Lord those things
which he has promised unto you.

9  But if having heard them ye
shall not repent, but shall still go
on to add to your sins, ye shall
be punished by him.

10  All these things that Shepherd,
the angel of repentance, commanded
me to write.



COMMAND I.

     Of believing in one God.

FIRST of all believe that
there is one God who created and
brought all things out of nothing
into existence.

2  He comprehends all things,
and is only INFINITE, not to be
comprehended by any.

3  Who can neither be defined
by any words, nor conceived by
the mind.

4  Therefore believe in him, and
fear him; and fearing him abstain
from all evil.

5  Keep these things, and cast
all lust and iniquity far from
thee, and put on righteousness,
and thou shalt live to God, if thou
shalt keep his commandment.



COMMAND II.

     That we must avoid detraction, and do our
     alms-deeds with simplicity.

HE said unto me, Be innocent
and without disguise; so shalt
thou be like an infant who knows
no malice which destroys the
life of man.

2  Especially see that thou speak
evil of none, nor willingly hear
any one speak evil of others.

3  For if thou observest not this,
thou also who hearest shall be
partaker of the sin of him that
speaketh evil, by believing the
slander, and thou also shalt have
sin, because thou believedst him
that spoke evil of thy brother.

4  Detraction is a pernicious
thing; an inconstant, evil spirit;
that never continues in peace, but
is always in discord. Wherefore
refrain thyself from it, and keep
peace ever more with thy brother.

5  Put on an holy constancy,
in which there are no sins, but
all is full of joy; and do good
of thy labours.

6  Give without distinction to
all that are in want, not doubting
to whom thou givest.

7  But give to all, for God will
have us give to all, of all his own
gifts. They therefore that receive
shall give an account to God, both
wherefore they received and for
what end.

8  And they that receive without
real need, shall give an account
for it; but he that gives shall be
innocent.

9  For he has fulfilled his duty
as he received it from God; not
making any choice to whom he
should give, and to whom not.
And this service he did with
simplicity and to the glory
of God.

10 Keep therefore this command
according as I have delivered it
into thee: that thy repentance
nay be found to be sincere, and
that good may come to thy house;
and have a pure heart.



COMMAND III.

     Of avoiding lying, and the repentance of Hermas
     for his dissimulation.

MOREOVER he said unto me
love truth; and let all the
speech be true which proceeds out
of thy mouth.

2  That the spirit which the Lord
hath given to dwell in thy flesh
may be found true towards all
men; and the Lord be glorified,
who hath given such a spirit unto
thee: because God is true in all
his words, and in him there is no
lie.

3  They therefore that lie, deny
the Lord, and become robbers of
the Lord, not rendering to God
what they received from him.

4  For they received the spirit
free from lying: If therefore they
make that a liar, they defile what
was committed to them by the
Lord, and become deceivers.

5  When I heard this, I wept
bitterly; and when he saw me
weeping, he said unto me, Why
weepest thou? And I said, Because,
sir, I doubt whether I can be saved.

6  He asked me, Wherefore?
I replied, Because, sir, I never
spake a true word in my life; but
always lived in dissimulation, and
affirmed a lie for truth to all men;
and no man contradicted me, but
all gave credit to my words. How
then can I live, seeing I have done
in this manner?

7  And he said unto me, Thou
thinkest well and truly; for thou
oughtest, as the servant of God,
to have walked in the truth, and
not have joined an evil conscience
with the spirit of truth, nor have
grieved the holy and true Spirit
of God.

8  And I replied unto him,
Sir, I never before hearkened
so diligently to these things.
He answered, Now thou hearest them
Take care from henceforth, that
even those things which thou hast
formerly spoken falsely for the
sake of thy business, may, by
thy present truth receive pardon.

9  For even those things may
be forgiven, if for the time to come
thou shalt speak the truth; and
by so doing thou mayest attain
unto life.

10  And whosoever shall hearken
unto this command, and do it,
and shall depart from all lying,
he shall live unto God.



COMMAND IV.

     Of putting away one's wife for adultery.

FURTHERMORE, said he, I
command thee, that thou keep
thyself chaste; and that thou
suffer not any thought of any
other marriage, or of fornication,
to enter into thy heart; for such
a thought produces great sin.

2  But be thou at all times mindful
of the Lord, and thou shalt never
sin. For if such an evil thought
should arise in thy heart, then
thou shall be guilty of a great
sin; and they who do such things,
follow the way of death.

3  Look therefore to thyself, and
keep thyself from such a thought;
for where chastity remains in the
heart of a righteous man, there an
evil thought ought never to arise.

4  And I said unto him, Sir,
suffer me to speak a little to you.
He bade me say on. And I answered,
Sir, if a man that is faithful
in the Lord shall have a wife,
and shall catch her in adultery;
doth a man sin that continues to
live still with her?

5  And he said unto me, As long
as he is ignorant of her sin, he
commits no fault in living with
her; but if a man shall know his
wife to, have offended, and she
shall not repent of her sin, but go
on still in her fornication, and a
man shall continue nevertheless
to live with her, he shall become
guilty of her sin, and partake with
her in her adultery.

6  And I said unto him, What
therefore is to be done, if the
woman continues on in her sin?
He answered, Let her husband put
her away, and let him continue
by himself; but if he shall put
away his wife and marry another,
he also doth commit adultery.

7  And I said, What, if the
woman that is so put away, should
repent, and be willing to return
to her husband, shall she not be
received by him? He said unto me,
Yes; and if her husband shall
not receive her, he will sin, and
commit a great offence against
himself; for he ought to receive
the offender, if she repents: only
not often.

8  For, to the servants of God,
there is but one repentance; and
for this cause a man that putteth
away his wife ought not to take
another, because she may repent.

9  This act is alike both in the
man and in the woman. Now they
commit adultery, not only who
pollute their flesh, but who
also make an image. If therefore
a woman perseveres in any thing
of this kind, and repents not,
depart from her; and live not with
her, otherwise thou also shalt be
partaker of her sin.

10  But it is therefore commanded
that both the man and the woman
should remain unmarried, because
such persons may repent.

11  Nor do I in this administer
any occasion for the doing of these
things; but rather that whoso has
offended, should not offend any
more.

12  But for their former sins,
God who has the power of healing
will give a remedy; for he has
the power of all things.

13  I asked him again, and
said, Seeing the Lord hath thought
me worthy that thou shouldest
dwell with me continually, speak
a few words unto me, because I
understand nothing, and my heart
is hardened through my former
conversation; and open my
understanding because I am very
dull, and apprehend nothing at all.

14  And he answering said
unto me, I am the minister of
repentance, and give understanding
to all that repent. Does it not
seem to thee to be a very wise
thing to repent? Because he that
does so gets great understanding.

15  For he is sensible that he
hath sinned and done wickedly in
the sight of the Lord, and he
remembers within himself that he
has offended, and repents and does
no more wickedly, but does that
which is good, and humbles his
soul and afflicts it, because he has
offended. You see therefore that
repentance is great wisdom.

16  And I said unto him, For this
cause, sir, I inquire diligently
into all things, because I am a
sinner, that I may know what I
must do that I may live; because
my sins are many.

17  And he said unto me, Thou
shalt live if thou shalt keep these
my commandments. And whosoever
shall hear and do these commands
shall live unto God.

18  And I said unto him, I have
even now heard from certain
teachers, that there is no other
repentance beside that of baptism,
when we go down into the water,
and receive the forgiveness of our
sins; and that after that, we must
sin no more, but live in purity.

19  And he said unto me, Thou
hast been rightly informed. Never-
the-less seeing now thou inquirest
diligently into all things, I will
manifest this also unto thee; yet
not so as to give any occasion of
sinning, either to those who shall
hereafter believe, or to those
who have already believed in the
Lord.

20  For neither they who have
newly believed, or shall hereafter
believe, have any repentance of sins,
but forgiveness of them.

21  But as to those who have
been called to the faith, and since
that are fallen into any gross sin,
the Lord hath appointed repentance,
because God knoweth the thoughts
of all men's hearts, and their
infirmities, and the manifold
wickedness of the devil, who is
always contriving something
against the servants of God, and
maliciously lays snares for them.

22  Therefore our merciful Lord
had compassion towards his creature,
and appointed that repentance, and
gave unto me the power of it. And
therefore I say unto thee, if any
one after that great and holy
calling shall be tempted by the
devil and sin, he has one repentance.
But if he shall often sin and repent,
it shall not profit such a one;
for he shall hardly live unto God.

23  And I said, Sir, I am restored
again to life since I have thus
diligently hearkened to these
commands. For I perceive that if I
shall not hereafter add any more
of my sins, I shall be saved.

24  And he said, Thou shalt be
saved: and so shall all others, as
many as shall observe these
commandments.

25 And again I said unto him,
Sir, seeing thou hearest me
patiently, show me yet one thing
more. Tell me, saith he, what it
is.

26  And I said, If a husband or
a wife die, and the party which
survives marry again, does he sin
in so doing? He that marries
says he, sins not: howbeit, if
he shall remain single, he shall
thereby gain to himself great
honour before the Lord.

27  Keep therefore thy chastity
and modesty, and thou shalt live
unto God. Observe from henceforth
those things which I speak
with thee, and command thee to
observe, from the time that I
have been delivered unto thee, and
dwell in thy house.

28  So shall thy former sins be
forgiven, if thou shalt keep these
my commandments. And in like
manner shall all others be forgiven,
who shall observe these my commandments.



COMMAND V.

     Of the sadness of the heart, and of patience.

Be patient, says he, and long-
suffering; so shalt thou have
dominion over all wicked works,
and shall fulfil all righteousness.

2  For if thou shalt be patient,
the Holy Spirit which dwelleth in
thee shall be pure, and not be
darkened by any evil spirit; but
being full of joy shall be enlarged,
and feast in the body in which it
dwells, and serve the Lord with
joy, and in great peace.

3  But if any anger shall overtake
thee, presently the Holy Spirit
which is in thee will be straightened
and seek to depart from thee.

4  For he is choked by the evil
spirit, and has not the liberty of
serving the Lord as he would; for
he is grieved by anger. When,
therefore, both these spirits dwell
together, it is destructive to a
man.

5  As if one should take a little
wormwood, and put it into a vessel
of honey, the whole honey would
be spoiled; and a great quantity
of honey is corrupted by a very
little wormwood, and loses the
sweetness of honey, and is no
longer acceptable to its Lord
because the whole honey is made
bitter, and loses its use.

6  But if no wormwood be put
into the honey, it is sweet and
profitable to its Lord. Thus is
forbearance sweeter than honey,
and profitable to the Lord who
dwelleth in it.

7  But anger is unprofitable.
If therefore anger shall be mixed
with forbearance, the soul is
distressed, and its prayer is
not profitable with God.

8  And I said unto him, Sir,
I would know the sinfulness of
anger, that I may keep myself from
it. And he said unto me, Thou
shall know it; and if thou shalt
not keep thyself from it, thou shalt
lose thy hope with all thy house.
Wherefore depart from it.

9  For I the messenger of
righteousness am with thee, and
all that depart from it: as many
as shall repent with all their hearts,
shall live unto God; and I will be with
them, and will keep them all.

10  For all such as have repented
have been justified by the most
holy messenger, who is a minister
of salvation.

11  And now, says he, hear
the wickedness of anger; how
evil and hurtful is is, and how it
overthrows the servants of God;
for it cannot hurt those that are
full of faith because the power
of God is with them; but it
overthrows the doubtful, and those
that are destitute of faith.

12  For as often as it sees such
men, it casts itself into their
hearts; and so a man or woman
is in bitterness for nothing: for
the things of life, or for sustenance,
or for a vain word, if any should
chance to fall in; or by reason
of any friend, or for a debt,
or for any other superfluous
things of the like nature.

13  For these things are foolish,
and superfluous, and vain to the
servants of God. But equanimity
is strong, and forcible; and of
great power, and sitteth in great
enlargement; is cheerful, rejoicing
in peace; and glorifying God at
all times I with meekness.

14  And this long-suffering
dwells with those that are full of
faith. But anger is foolish, and
light, and empty. Now bitterness
is bred through folly; by
bitterness, anger; by anger, fury;
and this fury arising from so
many evil principles, worketh a
great and incurable sin.

15  For when all these things,
are in the same man in which the
Holy Spirit dwells, the vessel
cannot contain them, but runs
over: and because the Spirit being
tender cannot tarry with the evil
one; it departs and dwells with
him that is meek.

16  When, therefore, it is
departed from the man in whom it
dwelt, that man becomes destitute
of the Holy Spirit, and is afterwards
filled with wicked spirits, and
is blinded with evil thoughts.
Thus doth it happen to all angry
men.

17  Wherefore depart then from
anger, and put on equanimity, and
resist: wrath; so then shalt be
found with modesty and chastity
by God. Take good heed, therefore,
that thou neglect not this commandment.

18. For if thou shalt obey this
command, then thou shalt also be
able to observe the other commandments
which I shall command thee.

19  Wherefore strengthen thyself
now in these commands, that then
mayest live unto God. And whosoever
shall observe these commandments
shall live unto God.



COMMAND VI.

     That every man has two angels and of the
     suggestions of both.

I COMMANDED thee, said he,
in my first commandments,
that thou shouldst keep faith and
fear, and repentance. Yes, sir,
said I.

2  He continued. But now I
will shew thee the virtues of these
commands, that then mayest know
their effects; how they are
prescribed alike to the just
and unjust.

3  Do thou therefore believe the
righteous, but give no credit to
the unrighteous. For righteousness
keepeth the right way, but
unrighteousness the wicked way.

4  Do thou therefore keep the
right way, and leave that which is
evil. For the evil way has not a
good end, but hath many stumbling-
blocks; it is rugged and full
of thorns, and leads to destruction;
and it is hurtful to all such
as walk in it.

5  But they who go in the right
way walk with evenness, and without
offence; because it is not rough
nor thorny.

6  Thou seest therefore how it is
best to walk in this way. Thou
shalt therefore go, says he, and all
others, as many as believe in God
with all their heart, shall go
through it.

7  And now, says he, I understand
first of all what belongs to faith.
There are two angels with man;
one of righteousness, the other
of iniquity.

8  And I said unto him, Sir,
how shall I know that there are
two such angels with man? Hear,
says he, and understand.

9  The angel of righteousness,
is mild and modest, and gentle,
and quiet. When, therefore, he
gets into thy heart, immediately
he talks with thee of righteousness,
of modesty, of chastity, of
bountifulness, of forgiveness,
of charity, and piety.

10  When all these things come
into thy heart, know then that the
angel of righteousness is with thee.
Wherefore hearken to this angel
and to his works.

11  Learn also the works of the
angel of iniquity. He is first of
all bitter, and angry, and foolish;
and his works are pernicious, and
overthrow the servants of God.
When therefore these things come
into thine heart; thou shalt know
by his works, that this is the angel
of iniquity.

12  And I said unto him, Sir,
how shall I understand these
things? Hear, says he, and
understand; When anger overtakes
thee, or bitterness, know that he is
in thee:

13  As also, when the desire of
many things, and of the best meats,
and of drunkenness; when the
love of what belongs to others,
pride, and much speaking, and
ambition; and the like things,
come upon thee.

14  When therefore these things
arise in thine heart, know that the
angel of iniquity is with thee.
Seeing therefore thou knowest his
works, depart from them all, and
give no credit to him: because his
works are evil, and become not the
servants of God.

15  Here therefore thou hast
the works of both these angels.
Understand now and believe the
angel of righteousness, because
his instruction is good.

16  For let a man be never so
happy; yet if the thoughts of the
other angel arise in his heart, that
man or woman must needs sin.

17  But let man or woman be
never so wicked, if the works of
the angel of righteousness come
into their hearts, that man or
woman must needs do some good.

18  Thou seest therefore how
it is good to follow the angel of
righteousness. If therefore thou
shall follow him, and submit to
his works, thou shalt live unto God.
And as many as shall submit to
his work shall live also unto God.



COMMAND VII.

     That we must fear God but not the Devil.

FEAR God, says he, and keep
his commandments. For if
thou keepest his commandments
thou shalt be powerful in every
work, and all thy works shall be
excellent. For by fearing God,
thou shalt do everything well.

2  This is that tear with which
thou must be affected that thou
mayest be saved. But fear not
the Devil: for if thou fearest the
Lord, thou shalt have dominion
over him; because there is no
power in him.

3  Now if there be no power in
him, then neither is he to be
feared: for every one that has
power, is to be feared. But he
that has no power is despised by
every one.

4  Fear the works of the Devil,
because they are evil. For by
fearing the Lord, thou wilt fear
and do not the works of the Devil,
but keep thyself from them.

5  There is therefore a twofold
fear; if thou wilt not do evil, fear
the Lord and thou shalt not do it.
But if thou wilt do good, the fear
of the Lord is strong, and great
and glorious.

6  Wherefore, fear God and thou
shalt live: and whosoever shall
fear him, and keep his commandments,
their life is with the Lord.
But they who keep them not,
neither is there life in them.



COMMAND VIII.

     That we must flee from evil, and do good works.

I HAVE told thee, said he,
that there are two kinds of
creatures of the Lord, and that
there is a two-fold abstinence.
From some things therefore thou
must abstain, and from others not.

2  I answered, Declare to me,
sir, from what I must abstain, and
from what not. Hearken, said he,
Keep thyself from evil, and do it
not; yet abstain not from good,
but do it. For if thou shalt abstain
from what is good, and not do it,
thou shalt sin. Abstain therefore
from all evil, and thou shalt know
all righteousness.

3  I said, What evil things are
they from which I must abstain?
Hearken, said he; from adultery,
from drunkenness, from riots, from
excess of eating, from daintiness
and dishonesty, from pride, from
fraud, from lying, from detraction,
from hypocrisy, from remembrance
of injuries, and from all evil
speaking.

4  For these are the works of
iniquity, from which the servant
of God must abstain. For he that
cannot keep himself from these
things, cannot live unto God.

5  But hear, said he, what
follows of these kind of things:
for indeed many more there are
from which the servant of God must
abstain. From theft, and cheating;
from false witness, from covetousness,
from boasting, and all other things
of the like nature.

6  Do these things seem to thee
to be evil or not? Indeed they
are very evil to the servants of
God, Wherefore the servant of
God must abstain from all these
works.

7  Keep thyself therefore from
them, that thou mayest live unto
God, and be written among those
that abstain from them. And thus
have I shown thee what things
thou must avoid: now learn from
what thou must not abstain.

8  Abstain not from any good
works, but do them. Hear, said
he, what the virtue of those good
works is which thou must do, that
thou mayest be saved. The first
of all is faith; the fear of the
Lord; charity; concord; equity;
truth; patience; chastity.

9  There is nothing better than
these things in the life of men;
who shall keep and do these
things in their life. Hear next
what follow these.

10  To minister to the widows;
not to despise the fatherless and
poor; to redeem the servants of
God from necessity; to be hospitable
(for in hospitality there is
sometimes great fruit); not to be
contentious, but be quiet.

11  To be humble above all men;
to reverence the aged; to labour
to be righteous; to respect the
brotherhood; to bear affronts; to
be long-suffering; not to cast
away those that have fallen from
the faith, but to convert them, and
make them be of good cheer: to
admonish sinners; not to oppress
those that are our debtors; and all
other things of a like kind.

12  Do these things seem to thee
to be good or not? And I said,
What can be better than these
words? Live then, said he, in
these commandments, and do not
depart from them. For if thou
shalt keep all these commandments,
thou shalt live unto God. And all
they that shall keep these
commandments shall live unto God.



COMMAND IX.

     That we must ask of God daily;
     and without doubting.

AGAIN he said unto me; remove from
thee all doubting; and question
nothing at all when thou askest
any thing of the Lord; saying
within thyself, how shall I
be able to ask any thing of the
Lord and receive it, seeing I have
so greatly sinned against him?

2  Do not think thus, but turn
unto the Lord with all thy heart,
and ask of him without doubting,
and thou shalt know the mercy of
the Lord; bow that he will not
forsake thee, but will fulfil the
request of thy soul.

3  For God is not as men, mindful
of the injuries he has received;
but he forgets injuries, and has
compassion upon his creature.

4  Wherefore purify thy heart
from all the vices of this present
world; and observe the commands
I have before delivered unto thee
from God; and thon shall receive
whatsoever good things thou shalt
ask, and nothing shall be wanting
unto thee of all thy petitions; if
thou shalt ask of the Lord without
doubting.

5  But they that are not such,
shall obtain none of those things
which they ask. For they that are
full of faith, ask all things with
confidence, and receive from the
Lord, because they ask without
doubting. But he that doubts,
shall hardly live unto God, except
he repent.

6  Wherefore purify thy heart
from doubting, and put on faith,
and trust in God, and thou shall
receive all that thou shalt ask.
But if thou shouldest chance to
ask something, and not immediately
receive it, yet do not therefore
doubt, because thou hast not
presently received the petition
of thy soul.

7  For it may be thou shalt not
presently receive it for thy trial,
or else for some sin which thou
knowest not. But do not thou
leave off to ask, and then thou
shalt receive. Else if thou shalt
cease to ask, thou must complain
of thyself, and not of God, that he
has not given unto thee what thou
didst desire.

8  Consider therefore this doubting
how cruel and pernicious it is;
and how it utterly roots out many
from the faith, who were very
faithful and firm. For this doubting
is the daughter of the Devil, and
deals very wickedly with the
servants of God.

9  Despise it therefore, and thou
shalt rule over it on every occasion.
Put on a firm and powerful faith:
for faith promises all things
and perfects all things. But
doubting will not believe that it
shall obtain any thing by all that
it can do.

10.  Thou seest therefore, says
he, how faith cometh from above
from God; and hath great power.
But doubting is an earthly spirit,
and proceedeth from the Devil,
and has no strength.

11  Do thou therefore keep the
virtue of faith, and depart from
doubting, in which is no virtue,
and thou shalt live unto God. And
all shall live unto God, as many
as do these things.



COMMAND X.

     Of the sadness of the heart; and that
     we must take, heed not to grieve the
     spirit of God that is in us.

PUT all sadness far from thee;
for it is the sister of doubting
and of anger.  How, sir, said I
is it the sister of these? For
sadness, and anger, and doubting,
seem to me to be very different
from one another.

2  And he answered: Art thou
without sense that thou dost not
understand it? For sadness is the
most mischievous of all spirits,
and the worst to the servants of
God: It destroys the spirits of all
men, and torments the Holy Spirit,
and it saves again.

3  Sir, said I, I am very foolish,
and understand not these things.
I cannot apprehend how it can
torment, and yet save. Hear, said
he, and understand. They who
never sought out the truth, nor
inquired concerning the majesty
of God, but only believed, are
involved in the affairs of the
heathen.

4  And there is another lying
prophet that destroys the minds
of the servants of God; that is
of those that are doubtful, not of
those that fully trust in the Lord.
Now those doubtful persons come
to him, as to a divine spirit, and
inquire of him what shall befall
them.

5  And this lying prophet, having
no power in him of the Divine
Spirit, answers them according to
their demands, and fills their souls
with promises according as they
desire. Howbeit that prophet is
vain, and answers vain things to
those who are themselves vain.

6  And whatsoever is asked of
him by vain men, he answers them
vainly; nevertheless he speaketh
some things truly. For the Devil
fills him with his spirit, that he
may overthrow some of the
righteous.

7  Whosoever therefore are
strong in the faith of the Lord,
and have put on the truth; they
are not joined to such spirits, but
depart from them. But they that
are doubtful, and often repenting,
like the heathens, consult them,
and heap up to themselves great
sin, serving idols.

8  As many therefore as are
such, inquire of them upon every
occasion; worship idols, and are
foolish; and void of the truth.
For every spirit that is given
from God needs not to be asked:
but having the power of divinity
speaks all things of itself,
because he comes from above;
from the power of God.

10  But he, that being asked
speaks according to men's desires
and concerning many other affairs
of this present world, understands
not the tidings which relate unto
God. For these spirits are darkened
through such affairs, and corrupted,
and broken.

11  As good vines if they are
neglected, are oppressed with weeds
and thorns, and at last killed by
them; so are the men who believe
such spirits.

12  They fall into many actions
and businesses, and are void of
sense, and when they think of
things pertaining unto God, they
understand nothing at all; but
at any time they chance to hear
any thing concerning the Lord,
their thoughts are upon their
business.

13  But they that have the fear
of the Lord, and search out the
truth concerning God, having all
their thoughts towards the Lord;
apprehend whatsoever is said to
them, and forthwith understand
it, because they have the fear
of the Lord in them.

14  For where the spirit of the
Lord dwells, there is also much
understanding added. Wherefore
join thyself to the Lord, and thou
shalt understand all things.

15  Learn now, O unwise man!
how sadness troubleth the Holy
Spirit, and how it saves. When
a man that is doubtful is engaged
in any affair, and does not
accomplish it by reason of his
doubting; this sadness enters
into him, and grieves the Holy
Spirit, and makes him sad.

16  Again anger, when it over.
takes any man for any business he
is greatly moved; and then again
sadness entereth into the heart of
him, who was moved with anger,
and he is troubled for what he hath
done, and repenteth, because he
hath done amiss.

17  This sadness therefore seemeth
to bring salvation, because he
repenteth of his evil deed. But
both the other things, namely,
doubting and sadness, such as
before was mentioned, vex the
spirit: doubting, because his
work did not succeed; and sadness,
because he angered the Holy Spirit.

18  Remove therefore sadness
from thyself, and afflict not the
Holy Spirit which dwelleth in
thee, lest he entreat God, and
depart from thee. For the spirit
of the Lord which is given to
dwell in the flesh, endureth no
such sadness.

19  Wherefore clothe thyself
with cheerfulness, which has always
favour with the Lord, and thou shalt
rejoice in it. For every cheerful
man does well; and relishes those
things that are good, and despises
sadness.

20  But the sad man does always
wickedly. First, he doth wickedly,
because he grieveth the Holy Spirit,
which is given to man being of a
cheerful nature. And again he does
ill, because be prays with sadness
unto the Lord, and maketh not first
a thankful acknowledgment unto him
of former mercies, and obtains not
of God what he asks.

21  For the prayer of a sad man
has not always efficacy to come up
to the altar of God. And I said
unto him, Sir, why has not the
prayer of a sad man virtue to come
up to the altar of God?  Because,
said he, that sadness remaineth in
his heart.

22  When therefore a man's
prayer shall be accompanied with
sadness, it will not suffer his
requests to ascend pure to the altar
of God. For as wine when it is
mingled with vinegar, has not the
sweetness it had before; so sadness
being mixed with the Holy Spirit,
suffers not a man's prayer to be
the same as it would be otherwise.

23  Wherefore cleanse thyself
from sadness, which is evil, and
thou shalt live unto God. And all
others shall live unto God, as many
as shall lay aside sadness, and put
on cheerfulness.



COMMAND XI.

     That the spirits and prophets are to be
     tried by their works; and of a twofold, spirit.

HE showed me certain men
sitting upon benches, and
one sitting in a chair: and he said
unto me; Seest thou those who sit
upon the benches? Sir, said I,
I see them. He answered, They
are the faithful; and he who sits
in the chair is an earthly spirit.

2  For he cometh not into the
assembly of the faitful, but avoids
it. But he joins himself to the
doubtful and empty; and prophesies
to them in corners and hidden places;
and pleases them by speaking according
to all the desires of their hearts.

3 For he placing himself among
empty vessels, is not broken, but
the one fitteth the other. But
when he cometh into the company
of just men, who are full of the
spirit of God, and they pray unto
the Lord; that man is emptied,
because that earthly spirit flies
from him, and he is dumb, and
cannot speak anything.

4  As if in a store-house you
shall stop up wine or oil, and
among those vessels place an
empty jar; and when afterwards
you come to open it, you shall
find it empty as you stopped it up;
so those empty prophets when
they come among the spirits of
the just, are found to be such as
they came.

5  I said, How then shall a
man be able to discern them?
Consider what I am going to say
concerning both kinds of men;
and as I speak unto thee so shalt
thou prove the prophet of God,
and the false prophet.

6  And first try the man who
hath the spirit of God, because
the spirit which is from above is
humble, and quiet, and departs
from all wickedness; and from the
vain desires of the present world;
and makes himself more humble
than all men; and answers to none
when he is asked; nor to every
one singly: for the Spirit of God
doth not speak to a man when he
will, but when God pleases.

7  When therefore a man who hath
the Spirit of God hath come into
the church of the righteous, who
have the faith of God, and they
pray unto the Lord; then the holy
angel of God fills that man with
the blessed Spirit, and he speaks
in the congregation as he is moved
of God.

8  Thus therefore is the spirit,
of God known, because whosoever
speaketh by the Spirit of God,
speaketh as the Lord will.

9  Hear now concerning the
earthly spirit, which is empty and
foolish, and without virtue. And
first of all the man who is supposed
to have the Spirit, (whereas he hath
it not in reality), exalteth himself,
and desires to have the first seat,
and is wicked, and full of words.

10  And spends his time in pleasure,
and in all manner of voluptuousness,
and receives the reward of his
divination; which if he receives
not, he does not divine.

11  Should the Spirit of God
receive reward, and divine? It doth
not become a prophet of God so to
do.

12  Thus you seethe life of each
of these kind of prophets. Wherefore
prove that man by his life and works,
who says that he hath the Holy Spirit.
And believe the Spirit which comes
from God, and has power as such.
But believe not the earthly and
empty spirit, which is from the
devil, in whom there is no faith
nor virtue.

13  Hear now the similitude
which I am about to speak unto
thee. Take a stone, and throw it
up towards heaven; or take a
spout of water, and mount it up
thitherward; and see if thou
canst reach unto heaven.

14  Sir; said I, how can this be
done? For neither of those things
which you have mentioned, are
possible to be done. And he
answered, Therefore as these things
cannot be done, so is the earthy
spirit without virtue, and without
effect.

15  Understand yet farther the
power which cometh from above,
in this similitude. The grains of
hail that drop down are exceedingly
small; and yet when they fall upon
the head of a man, how do they
cause pain to it.

16  And again, consider, the
droppings of a house; how the
little drops falling upon the earth,
work a hollow in the stones.

17  So in like manner the least
things which come from above,
and fall upon the earth, have great
force. Wherefore join thyself
to this spirit, which has the
power; and depart from the other
which is empty.



COMMAND XII.

     Of a two fold  desire: that the commands of God,
     are not impossible: and that the devil is not
     to be feared by them that believe.

AGAIN he said unto me;
remove from thee all evil
desires, and put on good and
holy desires. For having put on a
good desire, thou shalt hate that
which is evil, and bridle it as thou
wilt. But an evil desire is dreadful,
and hard to be tamed.

2  It is very horrible and wild;
and by its wildness consumes men.
And especially if a servant of God
shall chance to fall into it, except
he be very wise, he is ruined by
it. For it destroys those who have
not the garment of a good desire
and are engaged in the affairs of
this present world; and delivers
them unto death.

3  Sir, said I, what are the works
of an evil desire, which bring men
unto death? Shew them to me that
I may depart from them. Hear, said he,
by what works an evil desire bringeth
the servants of God unto death.

4  First of all, it is an evil desire
to covet another man's wife, or
for a woman to covet another's
husband; as also to desire the
dainties of riches; and multitude
of superfluous meats; and drunkenness;
and many delights.

5  For in much delicacy there is
folly; and many pleasures are
needless to the servants of God.
Such lusting therefore is evil and
pernicious, which brings to death
the servants of God. For all such
lusting is from the devil.

6 Whosoever therefore shall
depart from all evil desires,
shall live unto God; but they
that are subject unto them shall
die forever. For this evil lusting
is deadly. Do thou therefore put
on the desire of righteousness,
and being armed with the fear of
the Lord resist all wicked lusting.

7 For this fear dwelleth in good
desires; and, when evil coveting
shall see thee armed with the fear
of the Lord, and resisting it; it
will fly far from thee, and not
appear before thee, but be afraid
of thy armour.

8  And thou shall have the victory,
and be crowned for it; and shall
attain to that desire which is
good; and shall give the victory
which thou hast obtained unto
God, and shall serve him in doing
what thou thyself wouldest do.

9  For if thou shalt serve good
desires, and be subject to them;
then thou shalt be able to get the
dominion over thy wicked lustings;
and they will be subject to thee,
as thou wilt.

10  And I said, Sir, I would
know how to serve that desire
which is good? Hearken, said he,
Fear God, and put thy trust in
him, and love truth, and
righteousness, and do that
which is good.

10  If thou shalt do these things,
thou shall be an approved servant
of God, and serve him; and all
others who shall in like manner
serve a good desire, shall live unto
God.

12  And when he had fulfilled
these twelve commands, he said
unto me, Thou hast now these
commands, walk in them; and exhort
those that hear them, to repent,
and that they keep their
repentance pure all the
remaining days of their life.

13  And fulfil diligently this
ministry which I commit to thee,
and thou shalt receive great
advantage by it, and find favour
with all such as shall repent
and believe thy words. For I am
with thee, and will force them
to believe.

14  And I said unto him, Sir,
these commands are great and
excellent, and able to cheer the
heart of that man that shall be
able to keep them. But, Sir,
I cannot tell, whether they can
be observed by any man?

15  He answered, Thou shalt
easily keep these commands, and
they shall not be hard: howbeit,
if thou shalt suffer it once to
enter into thine heart that they
cannot be kept by any one, thou
shalt not fulfil them.

16  But now I say unto thee,
if thou shalt not observe these
commands, and shall neglect them,
thou shalt not be saved, nor thy
children, nor thy house: because
thou hast judged that these
commands cannot be kept by man.

17  These things he spake
very angrily unto me, insomuch
that he greatly affrighted me,
for he changed his countenance
so that a man could not bear his
anger.

18  And when he saw me altogether
troubled and confounded, he began
to speak more moderately and
cheerfully, saying, O foolish,
and without understanding!

19  Unconstant, not knowing
the majesty of God how great and
wonderful he is; who created the
world for man, and hath made
every creature subject unto him;
and given him all power, that he
should be able to fulfil all these
commands.

20  He is able, said he, to fulfil
all these commands, who has the
Lord in his heart; but they who
have the Lord only in their mouths,
their hearts are hardened, and
they are far from the Lord: to
such persons these commands are
hard and difficult.

21 Therefore, ye that are empty
and light in the faith, put the
Lord your God in your hearts;
and ye shall perceive how that
nothing is more easy than these
commands, nor more pleasant, nor
more gentle and holy.

22  And turn yourselves to the
Lord your God, and forsake the
devil and his pleasures, because
they are evil, and bitter, and
impure. And fear not the devil,
because he has no power over you.

23  For I am with you, the
messenger of repentance, who have
the dominion over him. The devil
doth indeed affright men but his
terror is vain. Wherefore fear
him not, and he will flee from you.

24 And I said unto him; Sir,
hear me speak a few words unto
you. He answered, Say on: A
man indeed desires to keep the
commandments of God, and there
is no one but what prays unto God,
that he may be able to keep his
commandments;

25  But the devil is hard, and
by his power rules over the servants
of God. And he said; He cannot
rule over the servants of God,
who trust in him with all their
hearts.

26  The devil may strive, but he
cannot overcome them.

27  For if ye resist him, he will
flee away with confusion from you.
But they that are not full in the
faith, fear the devil, as if he had
some great power. For the devil
tries the servants of God and if he
finds them empty, he destroys
them.

28  For as man, when he fills up
vessels with good wine, and among
them puts a few vessels half full,
and comes to try and taste of the
vessels, doth not try those that are
full, because he knows that they
are good, but tastes those that are
half full, lest they should grow
sour; (for vessels half full soon
grow sour, and lose the taste of
wine:) so the devil comes to the
servants of God to try them.

29  They that are full of faith
resist him stoutly, and he departs
from them, because he finds no
place where to enter into them
then he goes to those that are not
full of faith, and because he has a
place of entrance he goes into
them, and does what he will with
them, and they become his servants.

30  But I, the messenger of
repentance, say unto you, fear not
the devil, for I am sent unto you,
that I may be with you, as many
as shall repent with your whole
heart, and that I may confirm you
in the faith.

31  Believe therefore, ye who
by reason of your transgressions
have forgot God. and your own
salvation; and adding to your
sins have made your life very
heavy.

32  That if ye shall turn to the
Lord with your whole hearts, and
shall serve him according to his
will; he will heal you of your
former sins, and ye shall have
dominion over all the works of the
devil.

33  Be not then afraid in the
least of his threatenings, for they
are without force, as the nerves of
a dead man. But hearken unto
me, and fear the Lord Almighty,
who is able to save and to destroy
you; and keep his commands, that
ye may live unto God.

34  And I said unto him; Sir,
I am now confirmed in all the
commands of the Lord whilst you
are with me, and I know that you
will break all the powers of the
devil.

35  And we also shall overcome
him, if we shall be able, through
the help of the Lord, to keep these
commands which you have delivered.

36  Thou shalt keep them, said
he, if thou shalt purify thy heart
towards the Lord. And all they
also shall keep them who shall
cleanse their hearts from the vain
desires of the present world, and
shall live unto God.






                         THE THIRD PART OF THE
                BOOK OF HERMAS, CALLED HIS SIMILITUDES.


SIMILITUDE I.

     That seeing we have no abiding city in this world,
     we ought to look after that which is to come.

AND he said onto me; Ye know
that ye who are the servants
of the Lord, live here as in
a pilgrimage; for your city
is far off from this city.

2  If, therefore, ye know your
city in which ye are to dwell,
why do ye here buy estates, and
provide yourselves with delicacies,
and stately buildings, and
supurfluous houses? For he that
provides himself these things
in this city, does not think
of returning into his own city.

3 O foolish, and doubtful, and
wretched man; who understandest
not that all these things belong
to other men, and are under the
power of another. For the Lord
of this city saith unto thee;
Either obey my laws, or depart
out of my city.

4  What therefore shalt thou do
who art subject to a law in thine
own city? Canst thou for thy
estate, or for any of those things
which thou hast provided, deny
thy law? But if thou shalt deny
it, and wilt afterwards return into
thy own city, thou shalt not be
received, but shall be excluded
thence.

5  See therefore, that like a man
in another country, thou procure
no more to thyself than what is
necessary, and sufficient for thee;
and be ready, that when the God
or Lord of this city shall drive
thee out of it thou mayest oppose
his law, and go into thine own
city; where thou mayest with all
cheerfulness live according to
thine own law with no wrong.

6  Take heed therefore ye that
serve God, and have him in your
hearts: work ye the works of
God, being mindful both of his
commands and of his promises,
which he has promised; and be
assured that he will make them
good unto you; if ye shall keep
his commandments.

7  Instead therefore of the
possessions that ye would otherwise
purchase, redeem those that are
in want from their necessities,
as every one is able; justify the
widows; judge the cause of the
fatherless; and spend your riches
and your wealth in such works as
these.

8  For this end has God enriched
you, that ye might fulfil these
kind of services. It is much
better to do this, than to buy lands
or houses; because all such things
shall perish with this present time.

9  But what ye shall do for the
name of the Lord, ye shall find
in your city, and shall have joy
without sadness or fear. Wherefore
covet not the riches of the heathen;
for they are destructive to the
servants of God.

10  But trade with your own riches
which you possess, by which ye may
attain unto everlasting joy.

11  And do not commit adultery,
nor touch any other man's wife,
nor desire her; but covet that
which is thy own business, and
thou shalt be saved.



SIMILITUDE II.

     As the vine is supported by the elm,
     so is the rich man helped by the prayers of the poor.

AS I was walking into the field,
and considered the elm and
the vine, and thought with myself
of their fruits, an angel appeared
unto me, and said unto me; What
is it that thou thinkest upon thus
long within thyself?

2  And I said unto him, Sir, I
think of this vine and this elm
because their fruits are fair.
And he said unto me; These two
trees are set for a pattern to
the servants of God.

3  And I said unto him, Sir, I
would know in what the pattern
of these trees which thou mentionest,
does consist. Hearken, saith he;
seest thou this vine and this
elm? Sir, said I, I see them.

4  This vine, saith he, is fruitful,
but the elm is a tree without fruit.
Nevertheless this vine unless it
were set by this elm, and supported
by it, would not bear much
fruit; but lying along upon the
ground, would bear but ill fruit,
because it did not hang upon the
elm; whereas, being supported
upon the elm, it bears fruit both
for itself and for that.

5  See, therefore, how the elm
gives no less, but rather more
fruit, than the vine. How, Sir,
said I, does it bear more fruit
than the vine? Because, said he,
the vine being supported upon
the elm gives both much and good
fruit; whereas, if it lay along
upon the ground, it would bear
but little, and that very ill too.

6  This similitude, therefore,
is set forth to the servants of God;
and it represents the rich and poor
man. I answered, Sir, make this
manifest unto me.   Hear, said he;
the rich man has wealth: howbeit
towards the Lord he is poor; for
he is taken up about his riches,
and prays but little to the Lord;
and the prayers which he makes
are lazy and without force.

7  When therefore, the rich man
reaches out to the poor those
things which he wants, the poor
man prays unto the Lord for the
rich; and God grants unto the
rich man all good things, because
the poor man is rich in prayer;
and his requests have great power
with the Lord.

8  Then the rich man ministers
all thing to the poor, because he
perceives that he is heard by the
Lord; and he the more willingly
and without doubting, affords him
what he wants, and takes care that
nothing be lacking to him.

9  And the poor man gives
thanks unto the Lord for the rich;
because they both do their work
from the Lord.

10  With men, therefore, the
elm is not thought to give any
fruit; and they know not, neither
understand that its company being
added to the vine, the vine bears a
double increase, both for itself and
for the elm.

11  Even so the poor praying
unto the Lord for the rich, are
heard by him; and their riches
are increased, because they minister
to the poor of their wealth.
They are, therefore, both made
partakers of each other's good
works.

12  Whosoever, therefore, shall
do these things, he shall not be
forsaken by the Lord, but shall be
written in the book of life.

13  Happy are they who are rich,
and perceive themselves to be
increased: for he that is sensible
of this, will be able to minister
somewhat to others.



SIMILITUDE III.

     As the greet trees in the winter cannot be
     distinguished from the dry; so neither can the
     righteous from the wicked in this present world.

AGAIN he showed me many
trees whose leaves were shed,
and which seemed to me to be
withered, for they were all alike.
And he said unto me, Seest thou
these trees?   I said, Sir, I see that
they look like dry trees.

2  He answering, said unto me;
These trees are like unto the men
who live in the present world. I
replied: Sir, why are they like
unto dried trees? Because, said
he, neither the righteous, nor
unrighteous, are known from one
another; but all are alike in this
present world.

3  For this world is as the winter
to the righteous men, because
they are not known, but dwell
among sinners.

4  As in the winter all the trees
having lost their leaves, are like
dry trees; nor can it be discerned
which are dry and which are green:
so in this present world neither
the righteous, nor wicked are
discerned from each other; but they
are all alike.



SIMILITUDE IV.

     As in the summer the living trees are distinguished
     from the dry by their fruit and green leaves;
     so in the world to come the righteous shall be
     distinguished from the unrighteous by their happiness.

AGAIN he showed me many
other trees, of which some
had leaves, and others appeared
dry and withered. And he said
unto me, Seest thou these trees
I answered, Sir, I see them; some
are dry, and others full of leaves.

2  These trees, saith be, which
are green, are the righteous, who
shall possess the world to come.
For the world to come, is the summer
to the righteous; but to sinners
it is the winter.

3  When, therefore, the mercy
of the Lord shall shine forth, then
they who serve God shall be made
manifest, and plain unto all. For
as in the summer the fruit of every
tree is shown and made manifest.
so also the works of the righteous
shall be declared and made manifest,
and they shall all be restored
in that world merry and joyful.

4  For the other kind of men,
namely the wicked, like the trees
which thou rawest dry, shall, as
such, be found dry and without
fruit in that other world; and like
dry wood shall be burnt; and it
shall be made manifest that they
have done evil all the time of their
life;

5  And they shall be burnt because
they have sinned and have not
repented of their sins. And
also all the other nations shall
be burnt, because they have not
acknowledged God their Creator.

6  Do then, therefore, bring forth
good fruit, that in the summer thy
fruit may be known; and keep
thyself from much business, and
thou shalt not offend. For they
who are involved in much business,
sin much; because they are taken
up with their affairs, and
serve not God.

7  And how can a man that does
not serve God, ask anything of
God, and receive it? But they
who serve him, ask and receive
what they desire.

8  But if a man has only one
thing to follow, he may serve God,
because his mind is not taken off
from God, but he serves him with
a pure mind.

9  If, therefore, thou shalt do
this, thou mayest have fruit in
the world to come; and as many as
shall do in like manner, shall
bring forth fruit.



SIMILITUDE V.
     Of a true fast, and the rewards of it:
     also of the cleanliness of the body.

AS I was fasting, and sitting
down in a certain mountain,
and giving thanks unto God for all
the things that he had done unto
me; behold, I saw the Shepherd,
who was wont to converse with
me, sitting by me, and saying
unto me:  What has brought thee
hither thus early in the morning?
I answered, Sir, to-day I keep a
station.

2  He answered, What is a station;
I replied, it is a fast. He said,
What is that fast?  I answered,
I fast as I have been wont to
do. Ye know not, said he, what
it is to fast unto God; nor is this
a fast which ye keep, profiting
nothing with God.

3  Sir, said I, what makes you
speak thus? He replied, I speak
it, because it is not the true fast
which you think that you keep;
but I will show you what that is
which is a complete fast, and
acceptable unto God.

4  Hearken, said he, The Lord
does not desire such a needless
fast; for by fasting in this manner,
thou advancest nothing in
righteousness.

5  But the true fast is this: Do
nothing wickedly in thy life, but
serve God with a pure mind; and
keep his commandments, and walk
according to his precepts, nor
suffer any wicked desire to enter
into the mind.

6  But trust in the Lord, that if
thou dost these things, any fearest
him, and abstaineth from every
evil work, thou shall live unto
God.

7  If thou shalt do this, thou
shall perfect a great fast, and an
acceptable one unto the Lord.

8  Hearken unto the similitude
which I am about to propose
unto thee, as to this matter.

9  A certain man having a farm,
and many servants, planted a vineyard
in a certain part of his estate for
his posterity:

10  And taking a journey into
a far country, chose one of his
servants which he thought the most
faithful and approved, and delivered
the vineyard into his care;
commanding him that he should
stake up the vines. Which if he
did, and fulfilled his command, he
promised to give him his liberty.
Nor did he command him to do
any thing more; and so went into
a far country.

11  And after that servant had
taken that charge upon him, he
did whatsoever his lord commanded
him. And when he had staked the
vineyard, and found it to be full
of weeds, he began to think within
himself, saying:

12  I have done what my lord
commanded me, I will now dig
this vineyard, and when it is digged,
it will be more beautiful; and the
weeds being pulled up, it will
bring forth more fruit and not be
choked by the weeds.

13  So setting about this work
he digged it, and plucked up all
the weeds that were in it; and so
the vineyard became very beautiful
and prosperous, not being choked
with weeds.

14  After some time the lord of
the vineyard comes and goes into
the vineyard, and when he saw
that it was handsomely staked and
digged, and the weeds plucked up
that were in it, and the vines
flourishing, he rejoiced greatly at
the care of his servant.

15  And calling his son whom
he loved, and who was to be his
heir, and his friends with whom
he was wont to consult; he tells
them what he had commanded his
servant to do, and what his
servant had done more; and they
immediately congratulated that
servant, that he had received so
full a testimony from his lord.

16  Then he said to them, I
indeed promised this servant his
liberty, if he observed the command
which I gave him; and he observed it,
and besides has done a good work
to my vineyard, which has exceedingly
pleased me.

17  Wherefore, for this work
which he hath done, I will make
him my heir together with my
son; because that when he saw
what was good, he neglected it
not, but did it.

18  This design of the lord both
his son and his friends approved,
namely, that his servant should be
heir together with his son.

19  Not long after this the master
of the family calling together, his
friends, sent from his supper several
kinds of food to that servant.

20  Which when he had received,
he took so much of them as was
sufficient for himself, and divided
the rest among his fellow-servants.

21  Which when they had received,
they rejoiced; and wished that
he might find yet greater favour
with his lord, for what he had
done to them.

22  When his lord heard all these
things, he was again filled with
great joy: and calling again his
friends and his son together, he
related to them what his servant
had done with the meats which he
had sent unto him.

23  They therefore so much the
more assented to the master of the
household; and he ought to make
that servant his heir together with
his son.

24  I said unto him, sir, I know
not these smilitudes, neither can
I understand them, unless you
expound them unto me. I will,
says he, expound, all things unto
thee whatsoever I have talked with
thee, or shown unto thee.

25  Keep the commandments of
the Lord and thou shalt be approved,
and shall be written in the number
of those that keep his commandments.
But if besides those things which
the Lord hath commanded, thou shalt
add some good thing; thou shall
purchase to thyself a greater dignity,
and be in more favour with the Lord
than thou shouldst otherwise have been.

26  If therefore thou shalt keep
the commandments of the Lord,
and shalt add to them these stations,
thou shall rejoice; but especially
if thou shalt keep them according
to my commands.

27  I said unto him, sir, whatsoever
thou shah command me, I will observe;
for I know that thou wilt be with me.
I will, said he, be with thee who hast
taken up such a resolution; and I will
be with all those who purpose in like
manner.

28  This fast, saith he, whilst
thou dost also observe the
commandments of the Lord, is
exceeding good; therefore thus
shalt thou keep it.

29  First of all, take heed to
thyself, and keep thyself from every
wicked act, and from every filthy
word, and from every hurtful desire;
and purify thy mind from all the
vanity of this present world. If
thou shalt observe these things,
this fast shall be right.

30  Thus therefore do.   Having
performed what is before written,
that day on which thou fastest
thou shalt taste nothing at all but
bread and water; and computing
the quantity of food which thou
art want to eat upon other days,
thou shalt lay aside the expense
which thou shouldest have made
that day, and give it unto the
widow, the fatherless, and the
poor.

31  And thus thou shalt perfect
the humiliation of thy soul; that
he who receives of it may satisfy
his soul, and his prayer come up
to the Lord God for thee.

32  If therefore thou shalt thus
accomplish thy fast, as I command
thee, thy sacrifice shall be
acceptable unto the Lord, and thy
fast shall be written in his book.

33  This station, thus performed,
is good and pleasing and acceptable
unto the Lord. These things if thou
shalt observe with thy children and
with all thy house, thou shalt
be happy.

34  And whosoever, when they
hear these things, shall do them,
they also shall be happy; and
whatsoever they shall ask of the
Lord they shall receive it.

35  And I prayed him that he
would expound unto me the similitude
of the farm, and the Lord, and of
the vineyard, and of the servant
that had staked the vineyard;
and of the weeds that were
plucked out of the vineyard; and
of his son and his friends which
he took into counsel with him;
for I understand that that was
a similitude.

36  He said unto me, Thou art
very bold in asking; for thou
oughtest not to ask any thing;
because if it be fitting to show it
unto thee, it shall be showed unto
thee.

37  I answered him; Sir, whatsoever
thou shalt show me, without explaining
it unto me, I shall in vain see it,
if I do not understand what it is.
And if thou shalt propose any
similitudes, and not expound them,
I shall in vain hear them.

38  He answered me again, saying:
Whosoever is the servant of God,
and has the Lord in his heart,
he desires understanding of him,
and receives it; and he explains
every similitude, and understands
the words of the Lord which need
an inquiry.

39  But they that are lazy and
slow to pray, doubt to seek from
the Lord: although the Lord be of
such an extraordinary goodness,
that without ceasing he giveth all
things to them that ask of him.

40  Thou therefore who art
strengthened by that venerable
messenger, and hast received such
a powerful gift of prayer; seeing
thou art not slothful, why dost
thou not now ask understanding of
the Lord, and receive it?

41  I said unto him; seeing I
have thee present, it is necessary
that I should seek it of thee, and
ask thee; for thou shewest all
things unto me, and speakest to
me when thou art present.

42  But if I should see or hear
these things when thou wert not
present, I would then ask the Lord
that he would chew them unto me.

43  And he replied, I said a
little before that thou wert subtle
and bold, in that thou asketh the
meaning of these similitudes.

44  But because thou still persistest,
I will unfold to thee this parable
which then desirest, that thou mayest
make it known unto all men.

45  Hear, therefore, said he,
and understand. The farm before
mentioned denotes the whole earth.
The Lord of the farm is he, who
created and finished all things;
and gave virtue unto them.

46  His son is the Holy Spirit;
the servant is the Son of God: the
vineyard is the people whom he
saves. The stakes are the messengers
which are set oven them by the Lord,
to support his people. The weeds
that are plucked up out of the
vineyard, are the sins which
the servants of God had
committed.

47  The food which he sent him
from his supper, are the commands
which he gave to his people by his
Son. The friends whom he called
to counsel with him, are the holy
angels whom he first created. The
absence of the master of the household,
is the time that remains unto
his coming.

48  I said unto him, Sir, all
these things are very excellent,
and wonderful, and good. But,
continued I, could I or any other
man besides, though never so wise,
have understood these things?

49  Wherefore now, sir, tell me,
what I ask. He replied, ask me
what thou wilt. Why, said I, is
the Son of God in this parable,
put in the place of a servant.

50  Hearken, he said: the Son
of God is not put in the condition
of a servant, but in great power
and authority. I said unto him,
how, sir? I understand it not.

51  Because, said he, the Son set
his messengers over those whom
the Father delivered unto him, to
keep every one of them; but he
himself laboured very much, and
suffered much, that he might blot
out their offences.

52  For no vineyard can be digged
without much labour and pains.
Wherefore having blotted out the
sins of his people, he showed to
them the paths of life, giving
them the law which he had
received of the Father.

53  You see, said he, that he is
the Lord of his people, having
received all power from his Father.
But why the lord did take his
son into counsel, about dividing
the inheritance, and the good
angels, hear now.

54  That Holy Spirit, which was
created first of all, he placed in the
body in which God should dwell;
namely, in a chosen body, as it
seemed good to him. This body
therefore into which the Holy
Spirit was brought, served that
Spirit, walking rightly and purely
in modesty; nor ever defiled that
Spirit.

55  Seeing therefore the body at
all times obeyed the Holy Spirit,
and laboured rightly and chastely
with him, nor faltered at anytime;
that body being wearied conversed
indeed servilely, but being
mightily approved to God with
the Holy Spirit, was accepted by
him.

56  For such a stout course
pleased God, because he was not
defiled in the earth, keeping the
Holy Spirit. He called therefore
to counsel his Son, and the good
angels, that there might be some
place of standing given to this
body which had served the Holy
Spirit without blame; lest it
should seem to have lost the
reward of its service.

57  For every pure body shall
receive its reward; that is found
without spot, in which the Holy
Spirit has been appointed to dwell.
And thus you have now the exposition
of this parable also.

58  Sir, said I, I now understand
your meaning, since I have heard
this exposition. Hearken farther,
said he: keep this thy body clean
and pure, that the Spirit which
shall dwell in it may bear witness
unto it, and be judged to have
been with thee.

59  Also take heed that it be not
instilled into thy mind that this
body perishes, and thou abuse it
to any lust. For if thou shalt
defile thy body, thou shalt also at
the same time defile the Holy
Spirit; and if thou shalt defile
the Holy Spirit, thou shall not
live.

60  And I said, What if through
ignorance this should have been
already committed, before a man
heard these words; How can he
attain into salvation, who has thus
defiled his body?

61  He replied, As for men's former
actions which through ignorance
they have committed, God only can
afford a remedy unto them; for all
the power belongeth unto him.

62  But now guard thyself; and
seeing God is almighty and merciful,
he will grant a remedy to what thou
hast formerly done amiss, if for the
time, to come thou shalt not defile
thy body and spirit:

63  For they are companions together,
and the one cannot be defiled but the
other will be so too. Keep therefore
both of them pure, and thou shalt
live unto God.



SIMILITUDE VI.

     Of two sorts of voluptuous men, and of
     their death and defection; and of the
     continuance of their pains.

AS I was sitting at home, and
praising God for all the things
which I had seen; and was thinking
concerning the commands, that they
were exceedingly good, and great,
and honest, and pleasant, and
such as were able to bring a man
to salvation; I said thus within
myself, I shall be happy if I walk
according to these commands; and
whosoever shall walk in them shall
live unto God.

2  Whilst I was speaking on this
wise within myself, I saw him
whom I had before been wont to
see, sitting by me; and he spake
thus unto me:

3  What doubtest thou concerning
my commands which I have delivered
unto thee? They are good, doubt not,
but trust in the Lord, and thou shalt
walk in them; for I will give thee
strength to fulfil them.

4  These commands are profitable
to those who shall repent of the
sins which they have formerly
committed; if for the time to come
they shall not continue in them.

5  Whosoever therefore ye be
that repent, cast away from you
the naughtiness of the present
world; and put on all virtue, and
righteousness, and so shall ye be
able to keep these commands;
and not sin from henceforth any
more.

6  For if ye shall keep yourselves
from sin for the time to come,
ye shall cut off a great deal
of your former sins. Walk in my
commands, and ye shall live unto
God: These things have I spoken
unto you.

7  And when he, had said this,
he added; let us go into the field,
and I will show thee shepherds of
sheep. I replied, sir, let us go.

8  And we came into a certain
field, and there he showed me a
young shepherd, finely arrayed,
with his garments of a purple
colour. And he fed large flocks;
and his sheep were full of pleasure,
and in much delight and cheerfulness;
and they skipping, ran here and there.

9  And the shepherd took very
great satisfaction in his flock; and
the countenance of that shepherd
was cheerful, running up and down
among his flock.

10  Then the angel said unto
me, Seest then this shepherd?
I answered, sir, I see him.
He said unto me, this is the
messenger of delight and pleasure.
He therefore corrupts the minds
of the servants of God, and turns
them from the truth, delighting them
with many pleasures, and they perish.

11   For they forget the commands
of the living God, and live in
luxury and in vain pleasures,
and are corrupted by the evil
angel, some of them even unto
death; and others to a falling
away.

12  I replied; I understand not
what you mean, by saying unto
death, and to a falling away.
Hear, says he; all those sheep
which thou sawest exceeding
joyful, are such as have for ever
departed from God, and given
selves up to the lusts of this
present time.

13  To these therefore there is
no return, by repentance, unto
life; because, to their other sins
they have added this, that they
have blasphemed the name of the
lord: These kind of men are
ordained unto death.

14  But those sheep which thou
sawest not leaping, but feeding in
one place; are such as have indeed
given themselves up to pleasure
and delights; but have not spoken
anything wickedly against the Lord.

15  These therefore are only
fallen off from the truth, and so
have yet hope laid up for them in
repentance.  For such a falling off
hath some hope still left of a
renewal; but they that are dead,
are utterly gone for ever.

16  Again we went a little farther
forward, and he showed me a great
shepherd, who had as it were a rustic
figure; clad with a white goat's skin,
having his bag upon his shoulder,
and in his hand a stick full of knots,
and very hard, and a whip in his other
hand; and his countenance was stern and
sour, enough to affright a man;
such was his look.

17  He took from that young
shepherd such sheep as lived in
pleasures, but did not skip up and
down; and drove them into a
certain steep craggy place fall of
thorns and briars, insomuch that
they could not get themselves free
from them:

18  But being entangled in them,
fed upon thorns and briars, and
were grievously tormented with
his whipping. For he still drove
them on, and afforded them not
any place, or time, to stand still.

19  When therefore I saw them so
cruelly whipped and afflicted,
I was grieved for them; because
they were greatly tormented, nor
had they any rest afforded them.

20  And I said unto the shepherd
that was with me: Sir, who is this
cruel and implacable shepherd, who
is moved with no compassion towards
these sheep? He answered, This
shepherd is indeed one of the holy
angels, but is appointed for the
punishment of sinners.

21  To him therefore are delivered
those who have erred from God,
and served the lusts and pleasures
of this world. For this cause he
punishes them every one according
to their deserts, with cruel and
various kinds of pains.

22  Sir, said I, I would know
what kind of pains they are which
every one undergoes? Hearken,
said he; The several pains and
torments are those which men
every day undergo in their present
lives.    For some  suffer losses;
others poverty; others divers
sicknesses. Some are unsettled; others
suffer injuries from those that are
unworthy; others fall under many
other trials and inconveniences.

23  For many with an unsettled
design at many things, and it
profiteth them not; and they say
that they have not success in their
undertakings.

24  They do not call to their
mind what they have done amiss,
and they complain of the Lord.
When therefore they shall have
undergone all kind of vexation
and inconvenience; then they are
delivered over to me for good
instruction, and are confirmed
in the Faith of the Lord, and
serve the Lord all the rest of
their days with a pure mind.

25 And when they begin to repent
of their sins, then they call to
mind their works which they have
done amiss, and give honour to
God, saying, that he is a just
Judge, and they have deservedly
suffered all things according to
their deeds.

26 Then for what remains of
their lives, they serve God with a
pure mind; and have success in
all their undertakings, and receive
from the Lord whatever they desire.

27  And then they give thanks
unto the Lord that they were
delivered unto me; nor do they
suffer any more cruelty.

28  I said unto him; Sir, I entreat
you still to show me now one thing.
What, said he, dost thou ask?
I said unto him; Are they who
depart from the fear of God,
tormented for the same time that
they enjoyed their false delight
and pleasures? He answered me;
they are tormented for the same
time.

29  And I said unto him; They
are then tormented but little;
whereas they who enjoy their
pleasures so as to forget God,
ought to endure seven times as
much punishment.

30  He answered me; Thou art
foolish, neither understandest thou
the efficacy of this punishment.
I said unto him; Sir, if I understood
it, I would not desire you to tell me.

31  Hearken, said he, and learn
what the force of both is, both of
the pleasure and of the punishment.
An hour of pleasure is terminated
within its own space: but one hour
of punishment has the efficacy of
thirty days.   a Whosoever therefore
enjoys his false pleasure for one day,
and is one day, tormented; that one
day of punishment is equivalent to
a whole year's space.

32 Thus look how many days
any one pursues his pleasures, so
many years is he punished for it.
You see therefore how that the
time of worldly enjoyments is but
short; but that of pain and torments,
a great deal more.

33  I replied; Sir, forasmuch as
I do not understand at all these
times of pleasure and pain; I
entreat you that you would explain
yourself more clearly concerning
them. He answered me, saying;
Thy foolishness still sticks unto
thee.

34.  Shouldst thou not rather
purify thy mind, and serve God?
Take heed, lest when thy time is
fulfilled, thou be found still
unwise. Hear then, as thou desirest,
that thou mayest the more easily
understand.

35  He that gives himself up one
day to his pleasures and delights,
and does whatsoever his soul desires,
is full of great folly, nor understands
what he does, but the day following
forgets what he did the day before.

36  For delight and worldly
pleasure are not kept in memory,
by reason of the folly that is rooted
in them.  But when pain and torment
befal a man a day, he is in effect
troubled the whole year after;
because his punishment continues
firm in his memory.

37  Wherefore he remembers it
with sorrow the whole year; and
then calls to mind his vain pleasure
and delight, and perceives that for
the sake of that he was punished.

38  Whosoever therefore have
delivered themselves over to such
pleasures, are thus punished; because
that when they had life, they rendered
themselves liable to death.

39  I said unto him; Sir, what
pleasures are hurtful? He answered;
That is pleasure to every man
which he doth willingly.

40  For the angry man, gratifying
his passion, perceives pleasure
in it; and so the adulterer, and
drunkard; the slanderer and liar;
the covetous man and the defrauder;
and whosoever commits anything like
unto these, he followeth his evil
disposition, because he receives
a satisfaction in the doing of it.

41  All these pleasures and delights
are hurtful to the servants of God.
For these therefore they are tormented
and suffer punishment.

42  There are also pleasures that
bring salvation unto men. For many,
when they do what is good, find
pleasure in it, and are attracted
by the delights of it.

43  Now this pleasure is profitable
to the servants of God, and brings
life to such men; but those hurtful
pleasures, which were before mentioned,
bring torments and punishment.

44  And whosoever shall continue
in them, and shall not repent of
what they have done, shall bring
death upon themselves.



SIMILITUDE VII.

     That they who repent, must bring forth,
     fruits worthy of repent once.

AFTER a few days I saw the
same person that before talked
with me, in the same field, in
which I had seen those shepherds,
And he said unto me; What seekest
thou? Sir, said I, I came to entreat
you that You would command the
shepherd, who is the minister of
punishment, to depart out of my
house, because he greatly afflicts
me.

3  And he answered, It is necessary
for thee to endure inconveniencies
and vexations; for so that good angel
hath commanded concerning thee,
because he would try thee.

4  Sir, said I; What so great
offence have I committed, that I
should be delivered to this messenger?
Hearken, said he: Thou art indeed
guilty of many sins, yet not so
many that thou shouldest be
delivered to this messenger.

5  But thy house hath committed
many sins and offences, and therefore
that good messenger being grieved
at their doings commanded that for
some time thou shouldst suffer
affliction; that they may both
repent of what they have done, and
may wash themselves from all the
lusts of this present world.

6  When therefore they shall have
repented, and be purified, then that
messenger which is appointed over
thy punishment, shall depart from
thee.

7  I said unto him; Sir, if they
have behaved themselves so as to
anger that good angel, yet what
have I done? He answered: They
cannot otherwise be afflicted,
unless thou, who art the head
of the family, suffer.

8  For whatsoever thou shalt
suffer, they must needs feel it
but as long as thou shalt stand
well established, they cannot
experience any vexation.

9  I replied; But, sir, behold
they also now repent with all their
hearts. I know, says he, that they
repent with all their hearts; but
dost thou therefore think that their
offences who repent, are immediately
blotted out.

10  No, they are not presently;
but he that repents must afflict his
soul and show himself humble in
all his affairs, and undergo many
and divers vexations.

11  And when he shall have suffered
all things that were appointed for him;
then perhaps HE that made him, and
formed all things besides, will be
moved with compassion towards him,
and afford him some remedy; and
especially if HE shall perceive
his heart who repents, to be free
from every evil work.

12  But at present it is expedient
for thee, and for thy house, to be
grieved; and it is needful that
thou shoudest endure much vexation,
as the angel of the Lord who committed
thee unto me, has commanded.

13  Rather give thanks unto the
Lord, that knowing what was to
come he thought thee worthy, to
whom he should foretel that trouble
was coming upon thee, who art able
to bear it.

14  I said unto him; Sir, but be
thou also with me, and I shall
easily undergo any trouble. I will,
said he, be with thee; and I will
entreat the messenger who is set
over thy punishment, that he
would moderate his afflictions
towards thee.

15  And moreover thou shalt
suffer adversity but for a little
time; and then thou shalt again
be restored to thy former state;
only continue on in the humility
of thy mind.

16  Obey the Lord with a pure
heart; thou, and thy house, and
thy children; and. walk in the
commands which I have delivered
unto thee; and then thy repentance
may be firm and pure.

17  And if thou shalt keep
these things with thy house, thy
inconveniencies shall depart from thee.

18  And all vexation shall in like
manner depart from those, whosoever
shall walk according to these commands.



SIMILITUDE VIII.

     That there are many kinds of elect, and of
     repenting sinners: and how all of theca shall
     receive a reward proportionable to the measure
     of their repentance and good works.

AGAIN he showed me a willow
which covered the fields and
the mountains, under whose shadow
came all such as were called by
the name of the Lord.

2  And by that willow stood an.
angel of the Lord very excellent
and lofty, and did cut down bows
from the willow with a great
hook; and reached out to the people
that were under the shadow of the
willow, little rods, as it were
about a foot long.

3  And when all of them had
taken them, he laid aside his hook,
and the tree continued entire, as I
had before seen it; at which I
wondered, and mused within myself.

4  Then that shepherd said unto
me; Forbear to wonder that the
tree continues whole,
not-with-standing so many boughs have
been cut off from it: but stay a
little, for now it shall be shown
thee, what that angel means, who
gave those rods to the people.

5  So he again demanded the
rods of them; and in the same
order that every one had received
them, was he called to him, and
restored his rod; which when he
had received, he examined them.

6  From some he received them
dry and rotten, and as it were
touched with the moth; those he
commanded to be separated from
the rest, and placed by themselves.
Others gave in their rods dry
indeed, but not touched with the
moth: these also he ordered to be
set by themselves.

7  Others gave in their rods half
dry; these also were set apart,
Others gave in their rods half dry
and cleft; these too were set by
themselves. Others brought in
their rods half dry and half green,
and these were in like manner
placed by themselves.

8  Others delivered up their rods
two parts green, and the third
dry; and they too were set apart.
Others brought their rods two
parts dry, and the third green;
and were also placed by themselves.

9  Others delivered up their rods
less dry (for there was but a very
little, to wit, their tops dry), but
they had clefts, and these were set
in like manner by themselves. In
the rods of others there was but a
little green, and the rest dry; and
these were set aside by themselves.

10  Others came, and brought
their rods green as they had
received them, and the greatest
part of the people brought their
rods thus; and the messenger
greatly rejoiced at these, and they
also were put apart by themselves.

11  Others brought in their rods
not only green, but full of branches;
and these were set aside, being
also received by the angel
with great joy. Others brought
their rods green with branches,
and those also some fruit upon
them.

12  They who had such rods,
were very cheerful; and the angel
himself took great joy at them;
nor was the shepherd that stood
with me, less pleased with them.

13  Then the angel of the Lord
commanded crowns to be brought,
and the crowns were brought made
of palms; and the angel crowned
those men in whose rods he found
the young branches with fruit, and
commanded them to go into the
tower.

14  He also sent those into the
tower, in whose hands he found
branches without fruit, giving a
seal unto them. For they had the
same garment, that is, one white
as snow; with which he bade them
go into the tower   And so he did
to those who returned their rods
green as they had received them;
giving them a white garment, and
so sent them away to go into the
tower.

15  Having done this, he said to
the shepherd that was with me,
I go my way; but do thou send
these within the walls, every one
into the place in which he has
deserved to dwell; examining first
their rods, but examine them
diligently that no one deceive thee;
and if any one shall escape thee,
I will try them upon the altar.
Having said this to the shepherd,
he departed.

16  After he was gone, the shepherd
said unto me; Let us take the rods
from them, and plant them; if
perchance they may grow green again.
I said unto him; Sir, how can those
dry rods ever grow green again?

17  He answered me; That tree.
is a willow, and always loves to
live. If therefore these rods shall
be planted, and receive a little
moisture, many of them will
recover themselves.

18  Wherefore I will try, and
will pour water upon them, and if
any of them can live, I will rejoice
with them; but if not, at least by
this means I shall be found not
to have neglected my part.

19  Then he commanded me to
call them; and they all came
unto him, every one in the rank
in which he stood, and gave him
their rods; which having received
he planted every one of them in
their several orders.

20  And after he had planted
them all, he poured much water
upon them, insomuch that they
were covered with water, and did
not appear above it. Then when
he had watered them, he said unto
me; Let us depart, and after a
little time we will return and visit
them.

21  For he who created this tree,
would have all those live that
received rods from it.   And I hope
now that these rods are thus
watered, many of them receiving
in the moisture, will recover:

22  I said unto him, Sir, tell
me what this tree denotes? For I
am greatly astonished, that after
so many branches have been cut
off, it seems still to be whole:
nor does there any thing the less
of it appear to remain, which
greatly amazes me.

23  He answered, Hearken. This
great tree which covers the plains
and the mountains, and all the
earth, is the law of God, published
throughout the whole world.

24  Now this law is the Son of
God, who is preached to all the
ends of the earth. The people
that stand under its shadow, are
those which have heard his preaching,
and believed.

25  The great and venerable
angel which you saw, was Michael
who had the power over his people,
and governs them. For he has
planted the law in the hearts
of those who have believed: and
therefore he visits them to whom
lie has given the law, to see if
they have kept it.

26  And he examines every
one's rod; and of those, many that
are weakened: for those rods are
the law of the Lord. Then he discerns
all those who have not kept the law,
knowing the place of every one of them.

27  I said unto him, Sir, why
did he send away some to the
tower, and left others here to you?
He replied, those who have
transgressed the law, which they
received from him, are left in my
power, that they may repent of
their sins: but they who fulfilled
this law and kept it, are under his
power.

28 But who then, said I, are
those, who went into the tower
crowned? He replied, all such as
having striven with the devil, have
overcome him, are crowned: and
they are those, who have suffered
hard things, that they might keep
the law.

29  But they who gave up their
rods green, and with young
branches, but without fruit, have
indeed endured trouble for the
same law, but have not suffered
death; neither have they denied
their holy law.

30  They who delivered up their
rods green as they received them,
are those who were modest and
just, and have lived with a
very pure mind, and kept the
commandments of God.

31  The rest thou shalt know,
when I shall have considered those
rods which I have planted and
watered.

32  After a few days we returned,
and in the same place stood that
glorious angel, and I stood by him.
Then he said unto me; Gird thyself
with a towel, and serve me.

33  And I girded myself with
a clean towel, which was made of
coarse cloth. And when he saw
me girded, and ready to minister
unto him, he said, Call those men
whose rods have been planted,
every one in his order as he
gave them.

34  And he brought me into the
field, and I called them all,
and they all stood ready in their
several ranks. Then he said unto
them; let every one pluck up his
rod, and bring it unto me. And
first they delivered theirs, whose
rods had been dry and rotten.

35  And those whose rods still
continued so, he commanded to
stand apart. Then they came
whose rods had been dry but not
rotten. Some of these delivered.
in their rods green; others dry
and rotten, as if they had been
touched by the moth.

36  Those who gave them up
green, he commanded to stand
apart: but those whose rods were
dry and rotten, he caused to stand
with the first sort. Then came
they whose rods had been half
dry, and cleft: many of these
gave up their rods green, and
uncleft.

37  Others delivered them up
green with branches, like unto
theirs who went crowned into the
tower. Others delivered them
up dry, but not rotten; and some
gave them up as they were before,
all dry, and cleft.

38  Every one of these he ordered
to stand apart; some by themselves,
others in their respective ranks.

32  Then came they whose rods
had been green, but cleft. These
delivered their rods altogether
green, and stood in their own
order. And the shepherd rejoiced
at these, because they were all
changed, and free from their
clefts.

40  Then they gave in their rods,
who had them half green and
half dry. Of these some were
found wholly green, others half
dry: others green, with young
shoots.   And all these were sent
away, every one to his proper
rank.

41  Then they gave up their
rods, who had them before two
parts green, and the third dry.
Many of those gave in their rods
green; many half dry; the rest
dry but not rotten. So these were
sent away, each to his proper
place.

42  Then came they who before
had their rods two parts dry and
the third green; many of these
delivered up their rods half dry,
others dry and rotten; others half
dry and cleft: but few green. And
all these were set every one in his
own rank.

43  Then they reached in their
rods, in which there was before
but a little green, and the rest
dry. Their rods were for the
most part found green, having
little boughs, with fruit upon
them; and the rest altogether
green.

44  And the shepherd upon sight
of these rejoiced exceedingly,
because he had found them thus;
and they also went to their
proper orders.

45  Now after he had examined
all their rods, he said unto me,
I told thee that this tree loved
life thou seest how many have
repented, and attained unto
salvation. Sir, said I, I see it.

46  That thou mightest know
saith he, that the goodness and
mercy of the Lord is great, and
to be had in honour; who gave
his spirit to them that were found
worthy of repentance.

47  I answered, Sir, why then
did not all of them repent? He
replied, Those whose minds the
Lords foresaw would be pure, and
that they would serve him with
all their hearts, to them he gave
repentance.

48  But for those whose deceit
and wickedness he beheld, and
perceived that they would not
truly return unto him; to them
he denied any return unto
repentance, lest they should again
blaspheme his law with wicked
words.

49  I said unto him; Now, Sir,
make known unto me, what is the
place of every one of those, who
have given up their rods, and
what their portion; that when
they may have not kept their seal
entire, but have wasted the seal
which they received, shall hear
and believe these thins, and may
acknowledge their evil deeds and
repent;

50  And receiving again their
seal from you, may give glory to
God, that he was moved with
compassion towards them, and sent
you to renew their spirits.

51  Hearken, said he; they
whose rods have been found
and rotten, and as it were touch
with the moth; are the deserters
and the betrayers of the church;

52  Who with the rest of their
crimes, have also blasphemed the
Lord, and denied his name when
he had called upon them. Therefore
all these are dead unto God
and thou seest that none of them
have repented, although they
have heard my commands which
thou bast delivered unto them.
From these men therefore life is
far distant.

53 They also who have delivered
up their rods dry, but not rotten,
have not been far from them. For
they have been counterfeits,
and brought in evil doctrines,
and have perverted the servants
of God, especially those
who had sinned; not suffering
them to return unto repentance,
but keeping them back by their
false doctrines.

54  These therefore have hope;
and thou seest that many of them
have repented, since the time
that thou hast laid my commands
before them; and many more
will yet repent. But they, that
shall not repent; shall lose both
repentance and life.

55  But they that have repented,
their place is begun to be within
the first walls, and some of them
are even gone into the tower.
Thou seest therefore, said he, that
in the repentance of sinners there
is life; but for those who repent
not, death is prepared.

56  Hear now   concerning
those who gave in their rods half
dry and full of clefts. Those whose
rods were only half dry, are the
doubtful; for they are neither
living nor dead.

57  But they who delivered in
their rods, not only half dry but
also full of clefts, are both doubtful
and evil speakers; who detract from
those that are absent, and have
never peace among themselves,
and who envy one another.

58  Howbeit, to those also
repentance is offered; for thou
seest that some of these have
repented.

59  Now all those of this kind
who have quickly repented, shall
have a place in the tower; and
they who have been more slow in
their repentance, shall dwell
within the walls: but they that shall
not repent, and shall continue on
in their wicked doings, shall die
the death.

60  As for those who had their
rods green, but yet cleft; they
are such as were always faithful
and good, but they had some envy
and strife among themselves
concerning dignity and pre-eminence.

61  Now all such as are vain, and
without understanding, contend
with one another about these
things.

62  Nevertheless, seeing they
are otherwise good, if when they
shall hear these commands they
shall amend themselves, and shall
at my persuasion suddenly repent;
they shall at last dwell in the
tower, like those who have truly
and worthily repented.

63  But if any one shall again
return to his dissension; he shall
be shut out from the tower, and
shall lose his life. For the life
of those who keep the commandments
of the Lord, consists in doing
what they are commanded; not in
principality, or in any other
dignity.

64  For by forbearance and humility
of mind, men shall attain unto life;
but by seditions and contempt of the
law, they shall purchase death unto
themselves.

65  They who in their rods
had half dry and half green, are
those who are engaged in many
affairs of the world, and are not
joined to the saints. For which
cause half of them liveth, and
half is dead.

66  Wherefore many of these
since the time that they have
heard my commands, have repented,
and begun to dwell in the tower.
But some of them have
wholly fallen away; to these there
is no more place for repentance.

67  For by reason of their present
interests, they have blasphemed
and denied God: and for this
wickedness they have lost life.
And of these many are still in
doubt, yet these may return; and
if they shall quickly repent, they
shall have a place in the tower;
but if they shall be more slow,
they shall dwell within the walls;
but if they shall not repent, they
shall die.

68  As for those who had two
parts of their rods green, and the
third dry; they have by manifold
ways denied the Lord. Of these
many have repented, and found
a place in the tower: and many
have altogether departed from
God. These have utterly lost life.

69  And some being in a doubtful
state, have raise up dissensions:
these may yet return, if they
shall suddenly repent and not
continue in their lusts; but if
they shall continue in their
evil-doing they shall die.

70  They who gave in their
rods two parts dry, and the other
been, are those who have indeed
been faithful, but withal rich and
full of good things; and thereupon
have desired to be famous
among the heathen which are
without, and have thereby fallen
into great pride, and begun to
aim at high matters, and to
forsake the truth.

71  Nor were they joined to the
saints, but lived with the heathen;
and this life seemed the more pleasant
to them. Howbeit they have not
departed from God, but continued
in the faith; only they have
not wrought the works of faith.

72  Many therefore of these have
repented; and begun to dwell in
the tower. Yet others still living
among the heathen. people, and
being lifted up with their vanities,
have utterly fallen away from
God, and followed the works and
wickedness of the heathen.
These kind of men therefore are
reckoned among strangers to the
Gospel.

73 Others of these began to be
doubtful in their minds; despairing
by reason of their wicked doings
ever to attain unto salvation
Others being thus made doubtful,
did moreover stir up dissensions.

74  To these therefore, and to
those who by reason of their doings
are become doubtful, there is still
hope of return; but they must repent
quickly, that their place may be in
the tower. But they that repent not,
and continue still in their pleasures,
are nigh unto death.

75   As for those who gave in
their rods green, excepting their
tops, which only were dry, and
had clefts; these were always
good, and faithful, and upright
before God: nevertheless they
sinned a little, by reason of their
empty pleasures and trifling
thoughts which they had within
themselves.

76  Wherefore many of them
when they heard my words,
repented forthwith, and began to
dwell in the tower. Nevertheless
some grew doubtful, and others
to their doubtful minds added
dissensions. To these therefore
there is still hope of return,
because they were always good;
but they shall not hardly be moved.

77  As for those, lastly, who
gave in their rods dry, their tops
only excepted, which alone were
green; they are such as have
believed indeed in God, but have
lived in wickedness; yet without
departing from God: having always
willingly borne the name of the
Lord, and readily received into
their houses the servants of God.

78  Wherefore hearing these
things they returned, and without
delay repented, and lived in all
righteousness. And some of them
suffered death: others readily
underwent many trials, being
mindful of their evil doings.

79  If And when he had ended
his explications of all the rods,
he said unto me, Go, and say unto
all men that they repent, and they
shall live unto God; because the
Lord being moved with great
clemency hath sent me to preach
repentance unto all:

80  Even unto those who by
reason of their evil doings, deserve
not to attain unto salvation. But
the Lord will by patient, and keep
the invitation that was made by
his Son.

81  I said unto him, sir, I hope
that all when they shall hear these
things, will repent. For I trust
that everyone acknowledging his
crimes, and taking up the fear
of the Lord, will return unto
repentance.

82  He said unto me, Whosoever
shall repent with all their
hearts, and cleanse themselves
from all the evils that I have
before mentioned, and not add
anything more to their sins,
shall receive from the Lord cure
of their former iniquities, if they do
not make any doubt of these commands,
and shall live unto God.

83  But they that shall continue
to add to their transgressions, and
still converse with the lusts of
the present world, shall condemn
themselves unto death. But do
thou walk in these commands, and
whosoever shall Walk in these, and
exercise them rightly, shall live
unto God.

84  And having showed me all
these things, he said; I will show
thee the rest in a few days.



SIMILITUDE IX.

     The greatest mysteries of the militant and
     triumphant Church which is to be built.

AFTER I had Written the Commands
and similitudes of the Shepherd,
the Angel of Repentance came unto
me, and said to me, I will show
thee all those things which the
Spirit spake with thee under
the figure of the church. For
that Spirit is the Son of God.

2  And because thou wert weak
in body, it was not declared unto
thee by the angel, until thou wert
strengthened by the Spirit, and
increased in force, that thou
mightest also see the angel:

3  For then indeed the building
of the tower was very well and
gloriously shown unto thee by the
church; nevertheless thou sawest
all things shown unto thee as it
were by a virgin.

4  But now thou art enlightened
by the angel, and yet by the same
Spirit. But thou must consider
all things diligently; for therefore
am I sent into thy house by that
venerable messenger, that when
thou shalt have seen all things
powerfully, thou mayest not be
afraid as before.

5  And he led me to the height
of a mountain in Arcadia, and we
sat upon its top. And he showed
me a great plain, and about it
twelve mountains in different
figures.

6  The first was black as soot.
The second was smooth, without
herbs. The third was full of
thorns and thistles. The fourth
had herbs half dried; of which
the upper part was green, but that
next the root was dry; and some
of the herbs, when the sun grew
hot, were dry.

7  The fifth mountain was very
rugged; but yet had green herbs.
The sixth mountain was full of
clefts, some lesser, and some
greater; and in these clefts grew
grass, not flourishing, but which
seemed to be withering.

8  The seventh mountain had
delightful pasture, and was wholly
fruitful; and all kinds of cattle,
and of the birds of heaven; fed
upon it; and the more they fed
on it, the more and better did the
grass grow.

9  The eighth mountain was full
of fountains, and from those
fountains were watered all kinds of
the creatures of Cod. The ninth
mountain had no water at all, but
was wholly destitute of it; and
nourished deadly serpents, very
destructive to men.

10  The tenth mountain was full
of tall trees, and altogether shady;
and under the shade of them lay
cattle resting and chewing the cud.

11  The eleventh mountain was
full of the thickest trees, and
those trees seemed to be loaded
with several sorts of fruits; that
whosoever saw them could not choose
but desire to eat of their fruit.

12  The twelfth mountain was
altogether white, and of a most
pleasant aspect, and itself gave a
most excellent beauty to itself.

13  In the middle of the plain
he showed me a huge white rock,
which rose out of the plain, and
the rock was higher than those
mountains, and was square; so
that it seemed capable of supporting
the whole world.

14  It looked to me to be old,
yet it had in it a new gate, which
seemed to have been newly hewn
out of it. Now that gate was
bright beyond the sun itself;
insomuch, that I greatly wondered
at its light.

15 About the gate stood twelve
virgins; of which four that stood
at the corners of the gate, seemed
to me to be the chiefest, although
the rest were also of worth: and
they stood in the four parts of the
gate.

16  It added also to the grace of
those virgins, that they stood in
pairs, clothed with linen garments,
and decently girded, their right
arms being at liberty, as if they
were about to lift up some burthen;
for so they were adorned, and were
exceeding cheerful and ready.

17  When I saw this, I wondered
with myself to see such great
and noble things. And again I
admired upon the account of those
virgins, that they were so handsome
and delicate; and stood with such
firmness and constancy, as if they
would carry the whole heaven.

18  And as I was thinking thus
within myself, the shepherd said
unto me; What thickest thou within
thyself? Why art thou disquieted,
and fillest thyself with care?

19  Do not seem to consider, as
if thou wert wise, what thou doest
not understand, but pray unto the
Lord, that thou mayest have ability
to understand it. What is to come
thou canst not understand, but
thou seest that which is before
thee.

20  Be not therefore disquieted
at those things which thou canst
not see; but get the understanding
of those which thou seest.

21  Forbear to be curious; and
I will show thee all things that I
ought to declare unto thee: but
first consider what yet remains.

22  And when he had said this unto
me I looked up, and behold I saw
six tall and venerable men coming;
their countenances were all alike,
and they called a certain multitude
of men; and they who came at their
call were also tall and stout.

23  And those six commanded
them to build a certain tower over
that gate. And immediately there
began to be a great noise of those
men running here and there about
the gate, who were come together
to build the tower.

24  But those virgins which stood
about the gate perceived that the
building of the tower was to be
hastened by them. And they
stretched out their hands, as if
they were to receive somewhat
from them to do.

25  Then those six men commanded,
that they should lift up stones
out of a certain deep place,
and prepare them for the building
of the tower. And there were
lifted up ten white stones, square,
and not cut round.

26  Then those six men called
the ten virgins to them, and
commanded them to carry all the
stones that were to be put into
the building, and having carried
them through the gate to deliver
them to those that were about to
build the tower.

27  Immediately the virgins began
all of them together to lift up
those stones, that were before
taken out of the deep.

28  And they who also stood about
the gate did carry stones in such
a manner, that those stones which
seemed to be the strongest were
laid at the corners, and the rest
were put into the sides;

29  And thus they carried all the
stones, and bringing them through
the gate delivered them to the
builders, as they had been
commanded: who receiving them
at their hands, built with them.

30  But this building was made
upon that great rock, and over the
gate; and by these the whole tower
was supported. But the building
of the ten stones filled the whole
gate, which began to be made for
the foundation of that tower.

31  After those ten stones did
five and twenty others rise up
out of the deep; and these were
placed in the building of the same
tower; being lifted up by those
virgins, as the others had been
before.

32 After these did fire and thirty
others rise up; and these were also
in like manner fitted into the same
work. Then forty other stones were
brought up, and all these were added
unto the building of that tower.

33  So there began to be four
ranks in the foundation of that
tower; and the stones ceased to
rise out of the deep; and they
also which built rested a little.

34  Again, those six men commanded
the multitude, that they should
bring stones out of those twelve
mountains to the building of the
same tower.

35  So they cut out of all the
mountains stones of divers colours,
and brought them and gave them to
the virgins; which when they had
received they carried them, and
delivered them into the building
of the tower.

36 In which when they were built
they became white, and different
from what they were before; for
they were all alike, and did
change their former colours.
And some were reached up by the
men themselves, which when they
came into the building, continued
such is they were put in.

37  These neither became white,
nor different from what they were
before; because they were not
carried by the virgins through
the gate. Wherefore these stones
were disagreeable in the building;
which, when these six men perceived
they commanded them to be removed,
and put again in the place from
which they were brought.

38  And they said to those who
brought these stones; Do not ye
reach up to us any stones for this
building, but lay them down by
the tower, that these virgins may
carry them and reach them to us.

39  For unless they shall be
carried by these virgins through
this gate, they cannot change their
colours: therefore do not labour
in vain.

40  So the building that day
was done; howbeit the tower was
not finished, for it was afterwards
to be built; therefore now also
there was some delay made of it.

41  And these six men commanded
those that built to depart, and
as it were to rest for some time;
but they ordered those virgins
that they should not depart from
the tower; so now they seemed
to me to be left for the guarding
of it.

42  When all were departed,
I said unto the shepherd; Sir,
why is not the building of the
tower finished? Because it cannot,
said he, be finished until its Lord
comes, and approves of the building;
that if he shall find any stones
in it that are not good they may
be changed; for this tower is built
according to his will.

43  Sir, said I, I would know
what the building of this tower
signifies; as also I would be
informed concerning this rock,
and this gate;

44  And concerning the mountains,
and the virgins, and the stones
that did rise out of the deep,
and were not cut, but put into
the building just as they came
forth; and why the ten stones
were first laid in the foundation;
then the twenty-five, then thirty-
five; then forty?

45  Also concerning those stones
that were put into the building,
and again taken out, and carried
back into their places? Fulfil, I
pray, the desire of my soul as to
all these things, and manifest all
unto me.

46  And he said unto me; If thou
shalt not be dull, thou shall
know all, and shall see all the
other things that are about to
happen in this, tower: and shall
understand diligently all these
similitudes.

47  And after a few days we
came into the same place where
we had sat before; and he said
unto me, Let us go unto the
tower; for the Lord of it will
come and examine it.

48  So we came thither, and
found none but those virgins there.
And he asked them whether the
Lord of that tower was come
thither? And they replied, that
he would be there presently to
examine the building.

49  After a very little while I
saw a great multitude of men
coming, and in the middle of them
a man so tall, that he surpassed
the tower in height.

50  About him were those six,
who before commanded in the
building, and all the rest of
those who had built that tower,
and many others of great dignity:
and the virgins that kept the tower
ran to meet him, and kissed him,
and began to walk near unto him.

51  But he examined the building
with so much care, that he handled
every stone; and struck every one
with a rod which he held in his hand:

52  Of which some being so struck
turned black as soot; others were
rough; some looked as if they had
cracks in them; others seemed maimed;
some neither black nor white; some
looked sharp, and agreed not with the
other stones, and others were full
of spots.

53  These were the several kinds
of those stones which were not
found proper in the building; all
which the Lord commanded to be
taken out of the tower, and laid
near it, and other stones to be
brought and put in their places.

54  And they that built, asked
him from which of the mountains
he would have stones brought to
put in the place of those that were
laid aside. But he forbad them
to bring any from the mountains,
and commanded that they should
take them out of a certain field
that was near.

55  So they digged in the field,
and found many bright square
stones, and some also that were
round. Howbeit, all that were
found in that field were taken
away, and carried through the
gate by those virgins; and those
of them that were square were
fitted and put into the places of
those that were pulled out.

56  But the round ones were not
put into the building, because they
were hard, and it would have
required too much time to cut them
but they were placed about the
tower, as if they should hereafter
be cut square, and put into the
building; for they were very
white.

57  When he who was chief in
dignity, and lord of the whole
tower saw this, he called to him
the shepherd that was with me,
and gave him the stones that were
rejected and laid about the tower,
and said unto him; cleanse these
stones with all care, and fit them
into the building of the tower, that
they may agree with the rest; but
those that will not suit with the
rest, cast away afar off from the
tower.

58 When he had thus commanded him,
he departed, with all those that
came with him to the tower but
those virgins still stood about
the tower to keep it.

59  And I said unto that shepherd;
How can these stones, seeing they
have been rejected, return into
the building of this tower?
He replied; I will cut off the
greatest part from these stones,
and will add them to the building,
and they will agree with the rest.

60  And I said, Sir, how will
they be able to fill the same place,
when they shall be so much cut
away? He answered; They that
shall be found too little shall be
put into the middle of the building,
and the greater shall be placed
without, and keep them in.

61  When he had said thus unto
me, he added; Let us go, and after
three days we will return, and
I will put these stones, being
cleansed, into the tower.

62  For all these that are about
the tower must be cleansed, lest
the master of the house chance to
come upon the sudden, and find
those which are about the tower
unclean; and be so exasperated
that these stones should never be
put into the building of this tower,
and I shall be looked upon to have
been unmindful of my master's
commands.

63  When therefore we came
after three days to the tower,
he said unto me; Let us examine
all these stones, and let us see
which of them may go into the
building. I answered, Sir,
let us see.

64  And first of all we began
to consider those which had been
black; for they were found just
such as they were when they were
pulled out of the tower: wherefore
he commanded them to be removed
from the tower and put by themselves.

65  Then he examined those
which had been rough; and commanded
many of those to be cut round, and
to be fitted by the virgins into
the building of the tower; so they
took them, and fitted them into
the middle of the building and
he commanded the rest to be laid
by with the black ones, for they
also were become black.

66 Next he considered those
which were full of cracks, and
many of those also he ordered to
be pared away, and so to be added
to the rest of the building, by the
came virgins.

67  These were placed without
because they were found entire;
but the residue through the
multitude of their cracks could
not be reformed, and therefore
were cast away from the building
of the tower.

68  Then he considered those
that had been maimed; many of
these had cracks, and were become
black; others had large clefts;
these he commanded to be placed
with those that were reected;

69  But the rest being cleansed
and reformed, he commanded to
be put into the building. These
therefore those virgins took up,
and fitted into the middle of the
building, because they were but
weak.

70 After these he examined those
which were found half white and
half black, and many of those
which were now black; these also
he ordered to be laid among
those that were cast away.


71 The rest were found altogether
white; those were taken up by the
virgins, and fitted into the same
tower: and they were put in the
outside, because they were found
entire; that so they might keep
in those that were placed in the
middle, for nothing was cut off
from them.

72  Next he looked upon those
which had been hard and sharp;
but few of these were made use of,
because they could not be cut, for
they were found very hard: but
the rest were formed, and fitted by
the virgins into the middle of the
building, because they were more
weak.

73  Then he considered those
which had spots; of these a few
were found black, and they were
carried to their fellows. The rest
were white and entire; and they
were fitted by the virgins into the
building, and placed in the outside,
by reason of their strength.

74  After this he came to
consider those stones which were
white and round: and he said unto
me, What shall we do with these
stones? I answered, Sir, I cannot
tell.

75  He replied, Canst thou
think of nothing then for these?
I answered, Sir, I understand not
this art; neither am I a stone-cutter,
nor can I tell anything.

76  And he said, seest thou not
that they are very round? Now
to make them square, I must cut
off a great deal from them; howbeit,
it is necessary that some of these
should go into the building of the
tower.

77  I answered; If it be necessary,
why do you perplex yourself, and
not rather choose, if you have
any choice among them, and fit
them into the building.

78  Upon this he chose out the
largest and brightest, and squared
them; which, when he had done
the virgins took them up, and
fitted them into the building.

79  And the rest that remained
were carried back into the same
field from which they were taken;
howbeit, they were not cast away;
because, said he, there is yet a
little wanting to this tower, which
is to be built; and perhaps the
Lord will have these stones fitted
into this building, because they
are exceeding white.

80  Then there were called twelve
very stately women, clothed with
a black garment, girded, and their
shoulders free, and their hair
loose. These seemed to me to be
country women.

81  And the shepherd commanded
them to take up those stones
which were cast out of the building,
and carry them back to the mountains
out of which they were taken.

82  And they took them all up
joyfully, and carried them back to
their places from whence they had
been taken.

83  When not one stone remained
about the tower, he said unto
me, Let us go about this tower,
and see whether anything be
wanting to it.

84  We began therefore to go
round about it; and when he saw
that it was handsomely built, he
began to be very glad; for it was
so beautifully framed, that any one
that had seen it must have been in
love with the building.

85  For it seemed to be all but
one stone, nor did a joint any
where appear; but it looked as if
it had all been cut out of one rock.

86  And when I diligently
considered what a tower it was,
I was extremely pleased: and he
said unto me, Bring hither some
lime and little shells, that I may
fill up the spaces of those stones
that were taken out of the building,
and put in again; for all things
about the tower must be made even.

87  And I did as he commanded
me, and brought them unto him
and he said unto me, Be ready to
help me, and this work will quickly
be finished.

88  He therefore filled up
the spaces of those stones, and
commanded the place about the tower
to be cleansed.

89  Then those virgins took besoms,
and cleansed all the place around,
and took away all the rubbish,
and threw water on; which being
done, the palace became delightful,
and the tower beauteous.

90  Then he said unto me, All
is now clean if the Lord should
come to finish the tower, he will
find nothing whereby to complain
of us.

91  When he had said this he
would have departed. But I laid
hold on his bag, and began to
entreat him for the Lord's sake, that
he would explain to me all things
that he had shown me.

92  He said unto me, I have at
present a little business; but I
will suddenly explain all things
unto thee. Tarry here for me till
I come.

93  I said unto him, Sir, what
shall I do here alone? He answered,
Thou art not alone, seeing all
these virgins are with thee.

94  I said, Sir, deliver me then
unto them. Then he called them
and said unto them, I commend
this man unto you until I shall
come;

95  So I remained with those
virgins: now they were cheerful
and courteous unto me; especially
the four, which seemed to be
the chieftest among them.

96  Then those virgins said
unto me, that shepherd will not
return hither to-day. I said unto
them, What then shall I do? They
answered, Tarry for him till the
evening, if perhaps he may come
and speak with thee; but if not,
yet thou shalt continue with us
till he does come.

97  I said unto them, I will
tarry for him till evening; but if
he comes not by that time, I will
go home, and return hither again
the next morning.

98  They answered me, As thou
art delivered unto us, thou mayest
not depart from us. I said, Where
shall I tarry?

99  They replied, Thou shalt
sleep with us as a brother, not
as a husband; for thou art our
brother, and we are ready from
henceforth to dwell with thee;
for thou art very dear to as.

100  Howbeit I was ashamed to
continue with them. But she that
seemed to be the chieftest amongst
them, embraced me, and began
to kiss me. And the rest when
they saw that I was kissed by her,
began also to kiss me as a brother;
and led me about the tower, and
played with me.

101  Some of them also sung
psalms, others made up the chorus
with them. But I walked about
the tower with them, rejoicing
silently, and seeming to myself
to be grown young again.

102  When the evening came on,
I would forthwith have gone
home, but they withheld me,
and suffered me not to depart.
Wherefore I continued with them
that night near the same tower.

103  So they spread their linen
garments upon the ground; and
placed me in the middle, nor did
they anything else, only they
prayed.

104  I also prayed with them
without ceasing, nor less than
they. Who, when they saw me pray
in that manner, rejoiced greatly:
and I continued there with their
till the next day.

105  And when we had worshipped God,
then the shepherd came and said unto
them: You have done no injury to
this man? They answered, Ask him.
I said unto him, Sir, I have received
a great deal of satisfaction in that
I have remained with them.

106  And he said unto me, How didst
thou sup? I answered, Sir, I feasted
the whole night upon the words of
the Lord. They received thee well
then, said he? I said, Sir, very well.

107  He answered, Wilt thou
now learn what thou didst desire?
I replied, Sir, I will: and first I
pray thee that thou shouldest show
me all things in the order that I
asked them.

108  He answered, I will do all
as thou wouldst have me, nor
will I hide any thing from thee.

109  First of all, Sir, said I,
tell me, what this rock and this
gate denote? Hearken, said he;
this rock, and this gate, are the
Son of God. I replied, Sir, how
can that be; seeing the rock is
old, but the gate new?

110  Hear, said he, O foolish
man! and understand. The Son
of God is indeed more ancient
than any creature; insomuch
that he was in council with his
Father at the creation oft all
things.

111  But the gate is therefore
new, because he appeared in the
last days in the fullness of time;
that they who shall attain unto
salvation, may by it enter into the
kingdom of God.

112  You have seen, said he,
those stones which were carried
through the gate, how they were
placed in the building of the
tower; but that those which were
not carried through the gate,
were sent away into their own
places?
113 I answered, sir, I saw it.
Thus, said he, no man shall enter
into the kingdom of God, but he
who shall take upon him the name
of the Son of God.

114  For if you would enter
into any city, and that city should
he encompassed with a wall, and
had only one gate, could you
enter into that city except by that
gate?

115 I answered, Sir, how could
I do otherwise? As therefore, said
he, there would be no other way
of entering into that city but by
its gate, so neither can any one
enter into the kingdom of God,
but only by the name of his Son,
who is most dear unto him.

116 And he said unto me,
Didst thou see the multitude of
those that built that tower? Sir,
said I, I saw it. He answered,
All those are the angels, venerable
in their dignity,

117  With those is the Lord
encompassed as with a wall: but
the gate is the Son of God, who is
the only way of coming unto God.
For no man shall go to God, but
by his Son.

118  Thou sawest also, said he,
the six men, and in the middle of
them that venerable great man,
who walked about the tower, and
rejected the stones out of the tower?

119  Sir, said I, I saw them.
He answered, that tall man was
the Son of God; and those six
were his angels of most eminent
dignity, which stand about him
on the right hand and on the left.

120  Of these excellent angels
none comes in unto God without
him. He added, Whosoever there.
fore shall not take upon him his
name, he shall nor enter into the
kingdom of God.

121  Then I said, What is this
tower? This, said he, is the church.
And what, Sir, are these virgins?
He said unto me, These are the
holy spirits, for no man can enter
into the kingdom of God, except
these clothe him with their garment,

122  For it will avail thee nothing
to take up the name of the Son of
God, unless thou shalt also
receive their garment from them.
For these virgins are the powers
of the Son of God. So shall a
man in vain bear his name, unless
he shall be also endued with his
powers.

123  And he said unto me, sawest
thou those stones that were cast
away? They bore indeed the name,
but put not on their garment.
I said, Sir, what is their
garment? Their very names,
said he, are their garment.

124  Therefore whosoever beareth
the name of the Son of God,
ought to bear their names also;
for the Son of God also himself
beareth their names.

125  As for those stones,
continued he, which being delivered
by their hands, thou sawest remain
in the building, they were clothed
with their power; for which cause
thou seest the whole tower of the
same colour with the rock, and made
as it were of one stone.

126 So also those who have
believed in God by his Son, have
put on his spirit. Behold there
shall be one spirit, and one body,
and one colour of their garments;
and all they shall attain this, who
shall bear the names of these virgins.

127 And I said, Sir, why then
were those stones cast away which
were rejected, seeing they also
were carried through the gate,
and delivered by the hands of
these virgins into the building
of this tower?

128 Seeing, said he thou takest
care to inquire diligently into all
things, hear also concerning those
stones which were rejected. All
these received the name of the
Son of God, and with that the
power of these virgins.

129 Having therefore received
these spirits, they were perfected,
and brought into the number of
the servants of God; and they
began to be one body, and to have
one garment, for they were endued
with the same righteousness,
which they alike exercised.

130  But after that they beheld
those women which thou sawest
clothed with a black garment,
with their shoulders at liberty and
their hair loose; they fixed their
desires upon them, being tempted
with their beauty; and were
clothed with their power,
and cast off the clothing
of the virgins:

131  Therefore were they cast
off from the house of God, and
delivered to those women. But
they that were not corrupted with
their beauty, remained in the
house of God. This, said he, is
the signification of those stones
which were rejected.

132  And I said, sir, what if
any of these men shall repent, and
cast away their desire of those
women, and be converted, and
return to these virgins, and put
on again their virtue; shall they
not enter into the house of God?

133 They shall enter, said he,
if they shall lay aside all the
works of those women, and shall
resume the power of these virgins,
and shall walk in their works.

134 And for this cause there is
a stop in the building, that if they
shall repent, they may be added
to the building of this tower; but
if they shall not repent, that others
may be built in their places, and
so they may be utterly cast away.

135 For all these things I gave
thanks unto the Lord, that being
moved with mercy towards all
those upon whom his name is
carried, he sent to us the angel of
repentance to preside over us who
have sinned against him; and that
he has refreshed our spirits which
were almost gone, and who had
no hope of salvation, but are now
refreshed to the renewal of life.

136  Then I said, Show me now
sir, why this tower is not built
upon the ground, but upon a rock,
and upon the gate? He replied,
Thou art foolish, and without
understanding, therefore thou
asketh this.

137 And I said, sir, I must
needs ask all things of you
because I understand nothing at all.
For all your answers are great and
excellent; and which a man can
hardly understand.

138  Hear, said he: The name
of the Son of God is great and
without bounds, and the whole
world is supported by it. If
therefore, said I, every creature
of God be sustained by his Son,
why should he not support those
also who have been invited by him,
and who carry his name, and walk
in his commandments?

139  Seest thou not, said he, that
he doth support them, who with
all their heart, bear his name?
He therefore is their foundation,
and gladly supports those who do
not deny his name, but willingly
bear it.

140 And I said: Sir, tell me
the names of these virgins; and of
those women that were clothed
with the black garment.

141  Hear, said he, the names of
those virgins which are the more
powerful, and stand at the corners
of the gate. These are their
names:

142 The first is called Faith;
the second Continence; the third
Power; the fourth Patience; the
rest which stand beneath these
are, Simplicity, Innocence,
Chastity, Cheerfulness, Truth,
Understanding, Concord, Charity.

143  Whosoever therefore bear
these names, and the name of the
Son of God, shall enter into the
kingdom of God.

144  Hear now, said he, the
names of those women, which
were clothed with the black garment.
Of these, four are the principal:
the first is Perfidiousness;
the second, Incontinence; the
third, Infidelity; the fourth,
Pleasure.

145 And the rest which follow
are called thus, Sadness, Malice,
Lust, Anger, Lying, Foolishness,
Pride, and Hatred. The servant
of God, which carries these spirits,
shall see indeed the kingdom of
God, but he shall not enter into it.

146  But, sir, what are those
stones which were taken out of the
deep and fitted into the building?
The ten, said he, which were
placed at the foundation, are the
first age; the following five-and-
twenty, are the second, of righteous
men.

147  The next thirty-five, are the
prophets and ministers of the Lord.
And the forty, are the Apostles and
doctors of the preaching of the
Son of God.

148  And I said, sir, why did the
virgins put even those stones into
the building after they were carried
through the gate? And he said,
Because these first carried those
spirits, and they departed not one
from the other, neither the men
from the spirits, nor the spirits
from the men:

149  But the spirits were joined
to those men even to the day of
their death; who if they had not
had these spirits with them, they
could not have been useful to the
building of this tower.

150  And I said, sir, show me
this farther.  He answered, What
dost then ask? Why did these
stones come out of the deep, and
were placed into the building of
this tower, seeing that they long
ago carried those holy spirits?

151  It was necessary, said he,
for them to ascend by water, that
they might be at rest. For they
could not otherwise enter into the
kingdom of God, but by laying
aside the mortality of their former
life.

152  They therefore being dead,
were nevertheless sealed with the
seal of the Son of God, and so
entered into the kingdom of God.

153  For before a man receives
the name of the Son of God, he is
ordained unto death; but when he
receives that seal, he is freed from
death, and assigned unto life.

154  Now that seal is the water
of baptism, into which men go
down under the obligation unto
death, but come up appointed unto
life.

155 Wherefore to those also was
this seal preached, and they made
use of it, that they might enter
into the kingdom of God.

156  And I said, Why then, sir,
did these forty stones also ascend
with them out of the deep, having
already received that seal?

157  He answered, Because
these Apostles and teachers, who
preached the name of the Son of
God, dying after they had received
his faith and power, preached to
them who were dead before: and
they gave this seal to them.

158  They went down therefore
into the water with them, and again
came up. But these went down
whilst they were alive, and came
up again alive: whereas those who
were before dead, went down dead,
but came up alive;

159  Through these therefore
they received life, and knew the
Son of God: for which cause they
came up with them, and were fit
to come into the building of the
tower; and were not cut, but put
in entire; because they died in
righteousness, and in great purity;
only this seal was wanting to
them.

160  Thus you have the explication
of these things.

161  I answered: Sir, tell me
now what concerns those mountains;
why are they so different, some
of one form, and some of another?

162 Hear, said he; These twelve
mountains which thou seest, are
twelve nations, which make up the
whole world. Wherefore the Son
of God is preached to them, by
those whom he sent unto them.

163  But why, said I, are they
different, and every one of a figure?
He replied, Hearken. Those twelve
nations which possess the whole
world, are twelve people.

164  And as thou hast beheld
these mountains different, so are
they. I will therefore open to
thee the meaning and actions of
every mountain.

165  But first, sir, said I, show
me this; Seeing these mountains
are so different, how have they
agreed in the building of this
tower; and been brought to one
colour; and are no less bright
than those that came out of the
deep?

166  Because, replied he, all the
nations which are under heaven,
have heard and believed in the
same one name of the Son of God
by whom they are called.

167  Wherefore having received
his seal, they have all been made
partakers of the same understanding
and knowledge; and their faith
and charity have been the same;
and they have carried the spirits
of these virgins together with his
name.

168  And therefore the building
of this tower appeared to be of the
same colour, and did shine like
the brightness of the sun.

169  But after that they had thus
agreed in one mind, there began to
be one body of them all; howbeit
some of them polluted themselves,
and were cast off from those of the
righteous, and again returned to
their former state, and became
even worse than they were before.

170  How, air, said I, were
they worse who knew the Lord?
He answered: If he who knows
not the Lord liveth wickedly,
the punishment of his wickedness
attends him;

171 But he who has known the
Lord, ought to abstain altogether
from all wickedness, and more and
more to be the servant of
righteousness.

172 And does not he then seem
to thee to sin more who ought to
follow goodness, if he shall prefer
the part of sin; than he who
offends without knowing the
power of God?

173 Wherefore these are indeed
ordained unto death; but they who
have known the Lord, and have
seen his wonderful works, if they
shall live wickedly, they shall be
doubly punished, and shall die for
ever.

174  As therefore thou hast seen
that after the stones were cast out
of the tower, which had been rejected,
they were delivered to wicked and
cruel spirits; and thou beheldest
the tower so cleansed, as if it had
all been made of one stone:

175  So the church of God, when
it shall be purified: (the wicked
and counterfeits, the mischievous
and doubtful, and all that have
behaved themselves wickedly in it,
and committed divers kinds of sin,
being cast out) shall become one
body, and there shall be one
understanding, one opinion,
one faith, and the same charity.

176 And then shall the Son of
God rejoice among them, and shall
receive his people with a pure will.

177 And I said; Sir, all these
things are great and honourable;
but now show unto me the effect
and force of every mountain: that
every soul which trusteth in the
Lord, when it shall hear these
things may honour his great, and
wonderful, and holy name.

178  Hear, said he, the variety
of these mountains, that is, of the
twelve nations.

179  They who have believed
of the first mountain, which is
black, are those who have revolted
from the faith, and spoken wicked
things against the Lord; and
betrayed the servants of God.

180  These are condemned to
death; there is no repentance for
them: and therefore they are
black, because their kind is
wicked.

181  Of the second mountain
which was smooth, are the
hypocrites, who have believed,
and the teachers of naughtiness:
and these are next to the foregoing,
which have not in them the fruit of
righteousness.

182  For as their mountain is
barren and without fruit so also
such kind of men have indeed the
name of Christians, but are empty
of faith; nor is there any fruit of
the truth in them.

183  Nevertheless there is room
left to them of repentance, if they
shall speedily pursue it; but if
they shall delay, they also shall
be partakers of death with the
foregoing kind.

184  I said, air, why is there
room left to those for repentance,
and not to the foregoing kind,
seeing their sins are well nigh the
same?

185  There is therefore, said he,
to these a return unto life by
repentance, because they have not
blasphemed against their Lord,
nor betrayed the servants of God:
but by their desire of gain have
deceived men, leading them according
to the lusts of sinners; wherefore
they shall suffer for this thing.

186  Howbeit there is still left
them room for repentance, because
they have not spoken any thing
wickedly against the Lord.

187  They who are of the
third mountain which had thorns
and brambles, are those who
believed, but were some of them
rich; others taken up with many
affairs: the brambles are their
riches; the thorns, those affairs in
which they were engaged.

188  Now they who are entangled
in much business, and in diversity
of affairs, join not themselves to
the servants of God, but wander,
being called away by those affairs
with which they are choked.

189  And so they which are rich,
with difficulty yield themselves to
the conversation of the servants
of God; fearing lest any thing
should be asked of them. These
therefore shall hardly enter the
kingdom of God.

190  For as men walk with difficulty
bare-foot over thorns, even so
these kind of men shall scarcely
enter into the kingdom of God.

191  Nevertheless there is afforded
to all these a return unto repentance,
if they shall quickly return to it;
because in their for-mer days they
having neglected to work, in the time
that is to come they may do some good.

192  If therefore having
repented they shall do the works
of righteousness, they shall live;
but if they shall continue in their
evil courses, they shall be delivered
to those women who will take away
their lives.

193  As for the fourth mountain,
which had many herbs, the upper
part of which is green, but
the roots dry, and some of which
being touched with the heat of the
sun, are withered;

194  It denotes the doubtful, who
have believed, and some others
who carry the Lord on their tongues,
but have him not in their hearts:
therefore their grass is dry,
and without root; because they
live only in words, but their
works are dead.

195  These therefore are neither
dead nor living, and withal are
doubtful. For the doubtful are
neither green nor dry; that is
neither dead nor alive.

196  For as the herbs dry away
at the sight of the sun, so the
doubtful, as soon as they hear of
persecution, and fear inconveniencies,
return to their idols, and again
serve them, and are ashamed
to bear the name of their Lord.

197  This kind of men then is
neither dead nor alive; nevertheless
these also may live, if they shall
presently repent; but if not,
they shall be delivered to those
women, who shall take away their
lives.

198  As concerning the fifth
mountain that is craggy, and yet
has green grass; they are of this
kind who have believed, and are
faithful indeed, but believe with
difficulty, and are bold and self-
conceited; and would be thought
to know all things, but really
know nothing.

199  Wherefore, by reason of
this confidence, knowledge is
departed from them; and a rash
presumption is entered into them.

200  But they carry themselves
high, and as prudent men; and
though they are fools, yet would
seem to be teachers.

201  Now by reason of this folly
many of them whilst they magnify
themselves, are become vain and
empty. For boldness and vain
confidence is a very evil spirit.

202  Wherefore many of these
are cast away; but others
acknowledging their error, have
repented, and submitted themselves
to those who are knowing.

203  And to all the rest of this
kind, there is repentance allowed;
forasmuch as they were not so
much wicked as foolish, and void
of understanding.

204  If these therefore shall
repent, they shall live unto God;
but if not, they shall dwell with
those women, who shall exercise
their wickedness upon them.

205  For what concerns the
sixth mountain having greater and
lesser clefts, they are such as have
believed; but those in which were
lesser clefts are they who have had
controversies among themselves;
and by reason of their quarrels
languish in the faith:

206  Nevertheless many of these
have repented, and so will the rest
when they shall hear my commands;
for their controversies are but
small, and they will easily
return unto repentance.

207  But those who have the
greater clefts, will be as stiff
stones, mindful of grudges and
offences, and full of anger among
themselves. These therefore are
cast from the tower, and refused
to be put into its building; for
this kind of men shall hardly
live.

208  Our God and Lord, who
ruleth over all things, and has
power over all his creatures, will
not remember our offences, but is
easily appeased by those who
confess their sins: but man being
languid, mortal, infirm, and full
of sins, perseveres in his anger
against man; as if it were in his
power to save or destroy him.

209  But I, as the angel who am
set over your repentance, admonish
you, that whosoever among you has
any such purpose he should lay it
aside, and return unto repentance;
and the Lord will heal your former
sins, if you shall purge yourself
from this evil spirit; but if you
shall not do it, ye shall be
delivered to him unto death.

210  As for the seventh mountain
in which the grass was green
and flourishing, and the whole
mountain faithful; and all kind of
cattle fed upon the grass of it, and
the more the grass was eaten, so
much the more it flourished;

211  They are such as believed,
and were always good and upright;
and without any differences among
themselves, but still rejoiced
in the servants of God, having
put on the spirit of these virgins;
and been always forward to show
mercy to all men, readily giving
to all men of their labours
without upbraiding, and without
deliberation.

212  Wherefore the Lord seeing
their simplicity and innocence,
has increased them in the works of
their hands, and given them grace
in all their works.

213  But I, who am the angel
appointed over your repentance,
exhort you, that as many as are of
this kind would continue in the
same purpose, that your seed may
not be rooted out for ever.

214  For the Lord hath tried
you, and written you into our
number; and all your seed shall
dwell with the Son of God; for ye
are all of his spirit.

215  As concerning the eighth
mountain in which were a great
many springs, by which every
kind of all the creatures of God
was watered; they are such as
have believed the Apostles which
the Lord sent into all the world to
preach;

216  And some of them being
teachers have preached and taught
purely and sincerely, and have
not in the least yielded to any evil,
desires, but have constantly walked
in righteousness and truth.

217  These therefore have their
conversations among the angels.

218  Again; as for what concerns
the ninth mountain which is
a desert, and full of serpents; they
are such as have believed, but had
many stains:

219  These are such ministers as
discharge their ministry amiss;
ravishing away the goods of the
widows and fatherless; and serve
themselves, not others, out of
those things which they have
received.

220 These, if they continue in
this covetousness, have delivered
themselves unto death, nor shall
there be any hope of life for them.
But if they shall be converted,
and shall discharge their ministry
sincerely, they may live.

221  As for those which were
found rough, they are such as
have denied the name of the Lord,
and not returned again to the
Lord, but have become savage
and wild; not applying themelves
to the servants of God; but being
separated from them, have for a
little carelessness lost their lives.

222  For as a vine that is forsaken
in a hedge, and never dressed,
perishes and is choked by the
weeds, and in time becomes wild,
and ceases to be useful to its lord;
so this kind of men despairing of
themselves, and being soured,
have begun to be unprofitable to
their Lord.

223  Howbeit, to these there is,
after all, repentance allowed, if
they shall not be found from their
hearts to have denied Christ; but
if any of these shall be found to
have denied him from his heart,
I cannot tell whether such a one
can attain unto life.

224  I say therefore that if any
one hath denied, he should in
these days return unto repentance;
for it cannot be that anyone
who now denies the Lord, can
afterwards attain unto salvation
nevertheless repentance is promised
unto them who have formerly denied.

225  But he who will repent
must hasten on his repentance,
before the building of this tower
is finished; otherwise, he shall be
delivered by those women unto
death.

226  But they that are maimed,
are the deceitful; and those who
mix with one another, are the
serpents that you saw mingled in
that mountain.

227  For as the poison of serpents
is deadly unto men, so the words
of such persons infect and
destroy men. They are therefore
maimed in their faith, by reason
of that kind of life which they
lead.

228  Howbeit some of them,
having repented, have been saved;
and so shall others of the same
kind be also saved, if they shall
repent; but if not, they shall die
by those women who power and
force posses,

229  For what concerns the
tenth mountain, in which were the
trees covering the cattle, they are
such as have believed; and some
of them have been bishops, that is,
governors of the churches.

230  Others, are such stones as
have not feignedly, but with a
cheerful mind entertained the
servants of God.

231  Then, such as have been set
over inferior ministries, and have
protected the poor and the widows;
and have always kept a chaste
conversation: therefore they
also are protected by the Lord.

232  Whosoever shall do on this
wise, are honoured with the Lord;
and their place is among the
angels, if they shall continue
to obey the Lord even unto the end.

233  As to the eleventh mountain
in which were trees loaded
with several sorts of fruit; they
are such as have believed, and
suffered death, for the name of the
Lord; and have endured with a
heavy mind, and have given up
their lives with all their hearts.

234  And I said, Why then, sir,
have all these fruit indeed, but yet
some fairer than others?

235 Hearken, said he: Whosoever
have suffered for the name of
the Lord are esteemed honourable
by the Lord; and all their offences
are blotted out, because they have
suffered death for the name of the
Son of God.

236  Hear now, why their fruits
are different, and some of them
excel others. They who were
brought before magistrates, and
being asked, denied not the Lord,
but suffered with a ready mind;
these are more honourable with
the Lord. The fruits therefore
that are the most fair are these.

237  But they who were fearful
and doubtful, and have deliberated
with themselves whether they
should confess or deny Christ, and
yet have suffered; their fruits are
smaller, because that this thought
came into their hearts.

238 For it is a wicked and evil
thought for a servant to deliberate
whether he should deny his master:
Take heed therefore ye who
have such thoughts, that this mind
Pontinrie not in you, and ye die
unto God.

239 But ye who suffer death for
his name sake, ought to honour
the Lord, that he has esteemed
you worthy to bear his name; and
that you should be delivered from
all your sins.

240  And why therefore do you
not rather esteem yourselves happy?
Ye think verily that if any
one among you suffer, he performs
a great work! Yet the Lord
giveth you life, and ye understand
it not.   For your offences did
oppress you; and if you had not
suffered for his name sake, ye would
now be dead unto the Lord.

241  Wherefore I speak this unto
you who deliberate whether ye
should confess or deny him. Confess
that ye have the Lord for your
God, lest at any time denying him,
ye be delivered up into bonds.

242  For if all nations punish
their servants which deny their
masters; what think you that the
Lord will do unto you, who has
the power of all things?

243  Remove therefore out of
your hearts these doubts, that ye
may live for ever unto God.

244  As for the twelfth mountain,
which was white, they are
such as have believed like sincere
children, into whose thoughts
there never came any malice, nor
have they ever known what sin
was, but have always continued in
their integrity.

245  Wherefore this kind of men
shall without all doubt inherit the
kingdom of God; because they
have never in any thing defiled
the commandments of God, but
have continued with sincerity in
the same condition all the days of
their lives.

246 Whosoever therefore, said
he, shall continue as children
without malice; shall be more
honourable than all those of whom
I have yet spoken: for all such
children are honoured by the
Lord, and esteemed the first of
all.

247 Happy therefore are ye
who shall remove all malice from
you, and put on innocence; be.
cause ye shall first see the Lord.
248 And after he had thus
ended his explication of all the
mountains, I said unto him, Sir,
show me now also what concerns
the stones that were brought out
of the plain, and put into the
tower in the room of those that
were rejected.

249  As also concerning those
round stones which were added
into the building of the tower;
and also of those who still
continued round.

250  Hear now, says he,
concerning those stones which were
brought out of the plain into the
building of the tower, and placed
in the room of those that were
rejected: they are the roots of
that white mountain.

251  Wherefore because those
who have believed of that mountain,
were very innocent; the lord of
this tower commanded that they
which were of the roots of this
mountain should be placed into
the building.

252  For he knew that if they
were put into, this building they
would continue bright; nor would
any of them any more be made
black.

253  But if he had added after
this manner, from the rest of the
mountains, he would almost have
needed again to visit the tower,
and to cleanse it.

254  Now all these white stones
are the young men who have believed,
or shall believe; for they are all
of the same kind.   Happy is this
kind, because it is innocent.

255  Hear now also concerning
those round and bright stones; all
these are of this white mountain.
But they are therefore found
round, because their riches have
a little darkened them from the
truth, and dazzled their eyes.

256  Howbeit they have never
departed from the Lord, nor has
any wicked word proceeded out
of their mouths; but all
righteousness, and virtue,
and truth.

257 When therefore the Lord
saw their minds, and that they
might adorn the truth; he
commanded that they should continue
good, and that their riches should
be pared away:

258  For he would not have
them taken wholly away, to the
end they might do some good
with that which was left, and live
unto God; because they also are
of a good kind.

259  Therefore was there little
cut off from them, and so they
were put into the building of this
tower.

260  As for the rest which
continued still round, and were
not found fit for the building of
this tower, because they have not
yet received the seal; they were
carried back to their place, be.
cause they were found very
round.

261  But this present world must
be cut away from them, and the
vanities of their riches; and then
they will be fit for the kingdom of
God. For they must enter into
the kingdom of God, because God
has blessed this innocent kind.

262 Of this kind therefore none
shall fall away: for though any of
them being tempted by the devil
should offend, he shall soon return
to his Lord God.

263  I the angel of repentance
esteem you happy, whosoever are
innocent as little children, because
your portion is good and honourable
with the Lord.

264  And I say unto all you
who have received this seal; keep
simplicity, and remember not the
offences which are  committed
against you, nor continue in
malice, or in bitterness, through
the memory of offences.

265  But become one spirit,
and provide remedies for these
evil rents, and remove them from
you; that the lord of the sheep
may rejoice at it; for he will
rejoice, if he shall find all whole.

266  But if any of these sheep
shall be found scattered away, Woe
shall be to the shepherds; and
if the shepherds themselves shall
be scattered; what will they answer
to the lord of the sheep-fold?
Will they say that they were
troubled by the sheep? But
they shall not be believed.

267  For it is an incredible thing
that the shepherd should suffer by
his flock; and he shall be the more
punished for his life.

268 Now I am the shepherd;
and especially must give an
account of you.

269  Wherefore take care of
yourselves whilst the tower is,
yet building. The Lord dwells
in those that love peace, for peace
is beloved; but he is far off from
the contentious, and those who are
full of malice.

270 Wherefore restore unto him
the Spirit entire, as ye received it.
For if thou shalt give unto a
fuller a garment new and whole,
thou wilt expect to receive it whole
again; if therefore the fuller shall
restore it unto thee torn, wouldst
thou receive it?

271 Wouldst thou not presently
be angry, and reproach him,
saying: I gave my garment to thee
whole, why halt thou rent it, and
made it useless to me? Now it is
of no use to me, by reason of the
rent which thou hast made in it.
Wouldst thou not say all this to a
fuller, for the rent which he made
in thy garment?

272 If therefore thou wouldst
be concerned for thy garment,
and complain that thou hadst not
received it whole; what thinkest
thou that the Lord will do, who
gave his Spirit to thee entire, and
thou hast rendered him altogether
unprofitable, so that he can be of
no use unto his Lord? For being
corrupted by thee, he is no longer
profitable to him.

273 Will not therefore the Lord
do the same concerning his Spirit,
by reason of thy deed? Undoubtedly,
said I, he will do the same
to all those whom he shall find to
continue in the remembrance of
injuries.

274 Tread not then under foot
he said, his mercy; but rather
honour him, because he is so
patient with respect to your offences,
and not like one of you; but repent,
for it will be profitable for you.

275  All these things which
are above written, I the shepherd
and angel of repentance, have
shown and spoken to the servants
of God.

276 If therefore ye shall believe
and hearken to these words, and
shall walk in them and correct
your ways, ye shall live. But if
ye shall, continue in malice, and
in the remembrance of injuries,
no such sinners shall live unto
God.

277 All these things which were
to be spoken by me, I have thus
delivered unto you. Then the
shepherd said unto me, Hast thou
asked all things of me?
I answered, sir, I have.

278  Why then, said he, hast
thou not asked concerning the
spaces of these stones that were
put in the building, that I may
explain that also unto thee?
I answered, sir, I forgot it.
Hear, then, said he, concerning
these also.

279  They are those who have
now heard these commands, and
have repented with all their
hearts;

280 And when the Lord saw
that their repentance was good
and pure, and that they could
continue in it, he commanded
their former sins to be blotted
out. For these spaces were their
sins, and they are therefore made
even that they might not appear.



SIMILITUDE X.

Of Repentance and alms-deeds.

AFTER I had written this
book, the angel which had
delivered me to that shepherd,
came into the house where I was
and sat upon the bed, and that
shepherd stood at his right hand.

2  Then he called me and said
unto me; I delivered thee and
thy house to this shepherd, that
thou mightest be protected by
him. I said, Yes, Lord.

3  If therefore, said he, thou
wilt be protected from all
vexations and from all cruelty, and
have success in every good word
and work, and have all virtue and
righteousness; walk in those
commands which he has given thee,
and thou shalt have dominion
over all sin.

4  For if thou keepest those
commands, all the lust and pleasure
of this present world shall be
subject to thee; and success shall
follow thee in every good undertaking.

5  Take therefore his gravity
and modesty towards thee, and
say unto all, that he is in great
honour and renown with God, and
is a prince of great authority, and
powerful in his office.

6  To him only is the power of
repentance committed throughout
the whole world. Does he not
seem to thee to be of great
authority?

7  But ye despise his goodness,
and the modesty which he shows
towards you.

8  I said unto him; Sir, ask
him since the time that he came
into my house whether I have
done any thing disorderly, or
have offended him in any thing?

9  I know, said he, that thou
hast done nothing disorderly,
neither wilt thou hereafter do
any such thing, and therefore I
speak these things with thee that
then mayest persevere; for he
has given me a good account
concerning thee.

10  But thou shalt speak these
things to others, that they who
either have repented, or shall
repent, may be like-minded with
thee, and he may give me as
good an account of them also;
and that I may do the same unto
the Lord.

11 I answered; Sir, I declare
to all men the wonderful works of
God; and I hope that all who
love them, and have before sinned,
when they shall hear these things,
will repent, and recover life.

12 Continue therefore, said he,
in this ministry, and fulfil it.
And whosoever shall do according
to the commands of this shepherd,
he shall live; and shall have great
honour both here and with the
Lord.

13  But they that shall not keep
his commands, flee from their life,
and are adversaries to it. And
they that follow not his commands,
shall deliver themselves
unto death; and shall be every
one guilty of his own blood.

14  But I say unto thee, keep
these commandments, and thou
shalt find a cure for all thy sins.

15  Moreover, I have sent
these virgins to dwell with thee;
for I have seen that they are very
kind to thee. Thou shalt therefore
have them for thy helpers,
that thou mayest the better keep
the commands which he hath given
thee; for these commands cannot
be kept without these virgins.

16  And as I see how they are
willing to be with thee, I will
also command them that they shall
not all depart from thy house.

17  Only do thou purify thy
house; for they will readily dwell
in a clean house. For they are
clean and chaste, and industrious;
and all of them have grace with
the Lord.

18  If therefore thou shalt have
thy house pure, they will abide
with thee. But, if it shall be
never so little polluted, they will
immediately depart from thy house;
for these virgins cannot endure any
manner of pollution.

19  I said unto him; Sir, I hope
that I shall so please them, that
they shall always delight to dwell
in my house. And as be to whom
you have committed me, makes
no complaint of me; so neither
shall they complain.

20  Then he said to that shepherd:
I see that the servant of God will
live and keep these commandments,
and place these virgins in a pure
habitation.

21 When he had said this,
he delivered me again to that
shepherd, and called the virgins,
and said unto them; Forasmuch as I
see that ye will readily dwell in
this man's house, I commend him
and his family to you, that ye may
not at all depart from his house.
And they willingly heard these
words.

22  Then he said unto me,
Go on manfully in thy ministry;
declare to all men the great things
of God, and thou shalt find grace
in this ministry.

23  And whosover shall walk
in these commands, shall live,
and be happy in his life. But he
that shall neglect them, shall not
live, and shall be unhappy in his
life.

24  Say unto all that whosoever
can do well, cease not to exercise
themselves in good works, for it
is profitable unto them. For I
would that all men should be
delivered from the inconveniences
they lie under.

25  For he that wants, and
suffers inconveniences in his
daily life, is in great torment
and necessity. Whosoever therefore
delivers such a soul from necessity,
gets great joy unto himself.

26  For he that is grieved with
such inconveniencies is equally
tormented, as if he were in chains.
And many upon the account of
such calamities, being not able to
bear them, have chosen even to
destroy themselves.

27  He therefore that knows the
calamity of such a man, and does
not free him from it, commits a
great sin, and is guilty of his
blood.

28  Wherefore exercise your.
selves in good works, as many as
have received ability from the
Lord; lest whilst ye delay to do
them, the building of the tower be
finished; because for your sakes
the building is stopped.

29  Except therefore ye shall
make haste to do well, the tower
shall be finished, and ye shall be
shut out of it.

30  And after he had thus spoken
with me, he rose up from the bed
and departed, taking the shepherd
and virgins with him.

31  Howbeit he said unto me,
that he would send back the
shepherd and virgins unto
my house.  Amen.




                       REFERENCES TO THE BOOK OF
                         HERMAS, THE SHEPHERD.

     [This book, divided into three parts, called his VISIONS, COMMANDS,
     and SIMILITUDES, is thus entitled, because it was composed by
     Hermas, brother to Pius, bishop of Rome; and because the Angel, who
     bears the principal part in it, is represented in the form and habit
     of a shepherd. Irenxus quotes it under the very name of Scripture.
     Origen thought it a most useful writing, and that it was divinely
     inspired; Eusebius says that, though it was not esteemed canonical,
     it was read publicly in the churches, which is corroborated by
     Jerome; and Athanasius cites it, calls it a most useful work, and
     observes, that though it was not strictly canonical, the Fathers
     appointed it to be read for direction and confirmation in faith and
     piety. Jerome, notwithstanding this, and that he applauded it in his
     catalogue of writers, in his comments upon it afterwards, terms it
     apocryphal and foolish.  Turtullian praised it when a Catholic, and
     abused it when a Montanist. Although Gelasius ranks it among the
     apocryphal books, it is found attached to some of the most ancient
     MSS. of the New Testament; and Archbishop Wake, believing it the
     genuine work of an apostolical Father, preserves it to the English
     reader by the foregoing translation, in which he has rendered the
     three parts of it not only more exact, but in greater purity than
     they had before appeared. The archbishop procured Dr. Grabe to
     entirely collate the old Latin version with an ancient MS. in the
     Lambeth library; and the learned prelate himself still further
     improved the whole from a multitude of fragments of the original
     Greek never before used for that purpose.]

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
