_Madam_,

Your Kind and Good Acceptance of my Endeavours in Work for You, and that
Esteem You have for what else I can do, make me bold to present this
Book to You; which by that time You have perused, I doubt not but You
will deem it worthy of the Title it bears; and indeed it was never
opened before: If it may yield You any Delight or Benefit, I shall be
glad; for as You have a true Love and Esteem for me, so I have a very
great Love and Honourable Esteem for You; and shall always be

_Your most Observant

servant_,

_HANNAH WOLLEY._




To all Ladies, Gentlewomen, and to all other of the Female Sex who do
delight in, or be desirous of good Accomplishments.


Ladies and Gentlewomen,

_I Presume those Bookes which have passed from me formerly, have got me
some little credit and esteem amongst you.

But there being so much time past since they were Printed, that
methinks, I hear some of you say_ I wish Mrs. _Wolley_ would put forth
some New Experiments _and to say the Truth, I have been importun'd by
divers of my Friends and Acquaintance to do so._

_I shall not give an Apish Example every Day or Week to follow
ridiculous and foolish Fancies, nor could I be too like the_ Spaniard,
_always to keep in one Dress: I am not ashamed, nor do I disown what I
have already Printed, but some of you being so perfect in your
practises, and I very desirous still to serve you, do now present you
with this_ Queen-like Closet: _I do assure you it is worthy of the
Title it bears, for the very precious things you will find in it._

_Thus beseeching your kind Acceptance of this Book, and of my earnest
Desires to you, I take my Leave, but shall always be to all who have
esteem for me,_

Their Faithful and

Humble Servant,

HANNAH WOLLEY.




    _Ladies, I do here present you (yet)
    That which sure will well content
    A Queen-like Closet rich and brave
    (Such) not many Ladies have:
    Or Cabinet, in which doth set
    Jems richer than in Karkanet;
    (They) only Eies and Fancies please,
    These keep your Bodies in good ease;
    They please the Taste, also the Eye;
    Would I might be a stander by:
    Yet rather I would wish to eat,
    Since 'bout them I my Brains do beat:
    And 'tis but reason you may say,
    If that I come within your way;
    I sit here sad while you are merry,
    Eating Dainties, drinking Perry;
    But I'm content you should so feed,
    So I may have to serve my deed._

THE

Queen-like CLOSET,

OR

Rich Cabinet.


1. _To make_ Aqua Mirabilis _a very delicate way._

Take three Pints of Sack, three Pints of White Wine, one quart of the
Spirit of Wine, one quart of the juice of Celandine leaves, of
Melilot-flowers, Cardamum-seeds, Cubebs, Galingale, Nutmegs, Cloves,
Mace, Ginger, two Drams of each; bruise them, and mix them with the Wine
and Spirits, let it stand all night in the Still, not an Alembeck, but
a common Still, close stopped with Rye Paste; the next morning make a
slow fire in the Still, and all the while it is stilling, keep a wet
Cloth about the neck of the Still, and put so much white Sugar Candy as
you think fit into the Glass where it drops.


2. _The Plague-Water which was most esteemed of in the late great
Visitation._

Take three Pints of Muskadine, boil therein one handful of Sage, and one
handful of Rue until a Pint be wasted, then strain it out, and set it
over the Fire again.

Put thereto a Penniworth of Long Pepper, half an Ounce of Ginger, and a
quarter of an Ounce of Nutmegs, all beaten together, boil them together
a little while close covered, then put to it one penniworth of
Mithridate, two penniworth of Venice Treacle, one quarter of a Pint of
hot Angelica Water.

Take one Spoonful at a time, morning and evening always warm, if you be
already diseased; if not, once a day is sufficient all the Plague time.

It is most excellent Medicine, and never faileth, if taken before the
heart be utterly mortified with the Disease, it is also good for the
Small Pox, Measles, or Surfets.


3. _A very Soveraign Water._

Take one Gallon of good Claret Wine, then take Ginger, Galingale,
Cinnamon, Nutmegs, Grains, Cloves, Anniseeds, Fennel-seeds,
Caraway-seeds, of each one dram; then take Sage, Mint, Red-Rose leaves,
Thyme, Pellitory of the Wall, Rosemary, Wild Thyme, Camomile, Lavander,
of each one handful, bruise the Spices small and beat the Herbs, and put
them into the Wine, and so let stand twelve hours close covered,
stirring it divers times, then still it in an Alembeck, and keep the
best Water by it self, and so keep every Water by it self; the first you
may use for aged People, the other for younger.

This most excellent Water was from Dr. _Chambers_, which he kept secret
till he had done many Cures therewith; it comforteth the Vital Spirits;
it helpeth the inward Diseases that come of Cold; the shaking of the
Palsie; it helpeth the Conception of Women that are barren; it killeth
the Worms within the Body, helpeth the Stone within the Bladder; it
cureth the Cold, Cough, and Tooth-ach, and comforteth the Stomach; it
cureth the Dropsie, and cleanseth the Reins; it helpeth speedily the
stinking Breath; whosoever useth this Water, it preserveth them in good
health, and maketh seem young very long; for it comforteth Nature very
much; with this water Dr. _Chambers_ preserved his own life till extreme
Age would suffer him neither to go nor stand one whit, and he continued
five years after all Physicians judged he could not live; and he
confessed that when he was sick at any time, he never used any other
Remedy but this Water, and wished his Friends when he lay upon his
Deth-Bed to make use of it for the preservation of their Health.


4. _To Make Spirit of Mints._

Take three Pints of the best white Wine, three handfuls of right Spear
mint picked clean from the stalks, let it steep in the wine one night
covered, in the morning, put it into a Copper Alembeck, and draw it with
a pretty quick fire; and when you have drawn it all, take all your Water
and add as much Wine as before, and put to the Water, and the same
quantity of Mint as before; let it steep two or three hours, then put
all into your Still, and draw it with a soft fire, put into your
Receiver a quantity of Loaf Sugar, and you will find it very excellent;
you may distil it in an ordinary Still if you please; but then it will
not be so strong nor effectual.

Thus you may do with any other Herbs whatsoever.


5. _To make the Cordial Orange-Water._

Take one dozen and a half of the highest coloured and thick rin'd
Oranges, slice them thin, and put them into two Pints of Malago Sack,
and one Pint of the best Brandy, of Cinamon, Nutmegs, Ginger, Cloves,
and Mace, of each one quarter of an Ounce bruised, of Spear-mint and
Balm one handful of each, put them into an ordinary Still all night,
pasted up with Rye Paste; the next day draw them with a slow fire, and
keep a wet Cloth upon the Neck of the Still; put in some Loaf Sugar into
the Glass where it dropeth.


6. _To make Spirit of Oranges or of Limons._

Take of the thickest rin'd Oranges or Limons, and chip off the Rinds
very thin, put these Chips into a Glass-bottle, and put in as many as
the Glass will hold, then put in as much Malago Sack as the Glass will
hold besides; stop the bottle close that no Air get in, and when you
use it, take about half a spoonful in a Glass of Sack; it is very good
for the Wind in the Stomach.


7. _To make Limon Water._

Take twelve of the fairest Limons, slice them, and put them into two
Pints of white Wine, and put to them of Cinamon and Galingale, of each,
one quarter of an Ounce, of Red Rose Leaves, Burrage and Bugloss
Flowers, of each one handful, of yellow Sanders one Dram, steep all
these together 12 hours, then distil them gently in a Glass Still, put
into the Glass where it droppeth, three Ounces of Sugar, and one Grain
of Amber-Greece.


8. _A Water for fainting of the Heart._

Take of Bugloss water and Red Rose Water, of each one Pint, of Red Cows
milk half a Pint, Anni-seed and Cinamon of each half an Ounce bruised,
Maiden hair two handfuls, Harts-tongue one handful, bruise them, and mix
all these together, and distil them in an ordinary Still, drink of it
Morning and Evening with a little Sugar.


9. _To make Rosemary Water._

Take a Quart of Sack or white Wine with as many Rosemary Flowers as will
make it very thick, two Nutmegs, and two Races of Ginger sliced thin
into it; let it infuse all night, then distil it in an ordinary Still as
your other waters.


10. _To make a most precious Water._

Take two Quarts of Brandy, of Balm, of Wood-Betony, of Pellitory of the
Wall, of sweet Marjoram, of Cowslip-Flowers, Rosemary-Flowers,
Sage-Flowers, Marigold-Flowers, of each of these one handful bruised
together; then take one Ounce of Gromwell seeds, one Ounce of sweet
Fennel seeds, one Ounce of Coriander seeds bruised, also half an Ounce
of Aniseeds and half an Ounce of Caraway-seeds, half an Ounce of Juniper
Berries, half an Ounce of Bay Berries, One Ounce of green Licoras, three
Nutmegs, one quarter of an Ounce of large Mace, one quarter of an Ounce
of Cinamon, one quarter of an Ounce of Cloves, half an Ounce of Ginger,
bruise all these well together, then add to them half a pound of Raisons
in the Sun stoned, let all these steep together in the Brandy nine days
close stopped, then strain it out, and two Grains of Musk, two of
Amber-Greece, one pound of refined Sugar; stop the Glass that no Air get
in, and keep it in a warm place.


11. _Doctor_ Butler's _Treacle Water._

Take the roots of Polipody of the Oak bruised, _Lignum Vitae_ thin
sliced, the inward part thereof, Saxifrage roots thin sliced, of the
shavings of Harts-horn, of each half a pound, of the outward part of
yellow Citron not preserved; one Ounce and half bruised, mix these
together;

Then take

   {Fumitory water}
   {Carduus-water }   Of each one
of {Camomile-water}   Ounce.
   {Succory-water }

of Cedar wood one Ounce, of Cinamon three drams, of Cloves three drams,
bruise all your forenamed things;

Then take of Epithimum two ounces and a half, of Cerratch six ounces, of
Carduus and Balm, of each two handfuls, of Burrage Flowers, Bugloss
Flowers, Gillyflowers, of each four ounces, of Angelica root, Elecampane
root beaten to a Pap, of each four ounces, of Andronichus Treacle and
Mithridate, of each four ounces; mix all these together, and
incorporate them well, and grind them in a Stone Mortar, with part of
the former Liquor, and at last, mix all together, and let them stand
warm 24 hours close stopped, then put them all into a Glass Still, and
sprinkle on the top of _Species Aromatica rosata_ and _Diambre_, of the
Species of _Diarodon abbatis_, _Diatrion Santalon_, of each six drams;
then cover the Still close, and lute it well, and distill the water with
a soft fire, and keep it close.

This will yield five Pints of the best water, the rest will be smaller.


12. _The Cordial Cherry Water._

Take nine pounds of red Cherries, nine pints of Claret Wine, eight
ounces of Cinamon, three ounces of Nutmegs; bruise your Spice, stone
your Cherries, and steep them in the Wine, then add to them half a
handful of Rosemary, half a handful of Balm, one quarter of a handful of
sweet Marjoram, let them steep in an earthen Pot twenty four hours, and
as you put them into the Alembeck, to distil them, bruise them with your
hands, and make a soft fire under them, and distil by degrees; you may
mix the waters at your pleasure when you have drawn them all; when you
have thus done, sweeten it with Loaf-Sugar, then strain it into another
Glass, and stop it close that no Spirits go out; you may (if you please)
hang a Bag with Musk and Amber-greece in it, when you use it, mix it
with Syrrup of Gilly-flowers or of Violets, as you best like it; it is
an excellent Cordial for Fainting fits, or a Woman in travel, or for any
one who is not well.


13. _A most excellent Water for the Stone, or for the Wind-Cholick._

Take two handfuls of Mead-Parsly, otherwise called Saxifrage, one
handful of Mother-Thyme, two handfuls of Perstons, two handfuls of
Philipendula, and as much Pellitory of the Wall, two ounces of sweet
Fennel seeds, the roots of ten Radishes sliced, steep all these in a
Gallon of Milk warm from the Cow, then distil it in an ordinary Still,
and four hours after, slice half an ounce of the wood called Saxifrage,
and put into the Bottle to the water, keep it close stopped, and take
three spoonfuls at a time, and fast both from eating and drinking one
hour after; you must make this water about Midsummer; it is a very
precious water, and ought to be prized.


14. _The Cock water, most delicate and precious for restoring out of
deep Consumptions, and for preventing them, and for curing of Agues,
proved by my self and many others._

Take a Red Cock, pluck him alive, then slit him down the back, and take
out his Intrals, cut him in quarters, and bruise him in a Mortar, with
his Head, Legs, Heart, Liver and Gizard; put him into an ordinary Still

handful of Mother-thyme, one handful of Rosemary one handful of Burrage,
one quart of Red Rose water, two ounces of Harts-horn, two ounces of

droppeth one pound of white Sugar Candy beaten very small, twelve
peniworth of Leaf-Gold, seven grains of Musk, eleven grains of
Amber-greece, seven grains of Bezoar stone; when it is all distilled,
mix all the waters together, and every morning fasting, and every
evening when you go to bed, take four or five Spoonfuls of it warm, for
about a Month together, this hath cured many when the Doctors have given
them over.


15. _Walnut water, or the Water of Life._

Take green Walnuts in the beginning of _June_, beat them in a Mortar,
and distil them in an ordinary Still, keep that Water by it self, then
about Midsummer gather some more, and distil them as you did before,
keep that also by it self, then take a quart of each and mix them
together, and distil them in a Glass Still, and keep it for your use;
the Virtues are as followeth; It will help all manner of Dropsies and
Palsies, drank with Wine fasting; it is good for the eyes, if you put
one drop therein; it helpeth Conception in Women if they drink thereof
one spoonful at a time in a Glass of Wine once a day, and it will make
your skin fair if you wash therewith; it is good for all infirmities of
the Body, and driveth out all Corruption, and inward Bruises; if it be
drunk with Wine moderately, it killeth Worms in the Body; whosoever
drinketh much of it, shall live so long as Nature shall continue in him.

Finally, if you have any Wine that is turned, put in a little Viol or
Glass full of it, and keep it close stopped, and within four days it
will come to it self again.

Cinamon, one handful of Balm, a large handful of Cowslips, two handfuls
of Rosemary Flowers, half an ounce of Mace, half an ounce of Cloves,
half an ounce of Nutmegs, all bruised, steep these together four days in
an earthen Pot, and covered very close, distil them in an ordinary
Still well pasted, and do it with a very slow fire; save the first water
by it self, and the small by it self, to give to Children; when you have
occasion to use it, take a spoonful thereof, sweetned with Loaf-Sugar;
this Water is good to drive out any Infection from the heart, and to
comfort the Spirits.


18. _Another most excellent Cordial._

Take Celandine, Sage, Costmary, Rue, Wormwood, Mugwort, Scordium,

pasted up; when you use it, sweeten it with fine Sugar, and warm it.


19. _To make_ Rosa Solis.

bruise them small, take also a pound of Loaf-Sugar well beaten, a
quarter of a pound of Powder of Pearl, and six leaves of Book Gold; put

very close, and let it stand in the Sun fourteen days, ever taking it in
at night; then strain it, and put it into a close Bottle; you must not
put in the Pearl, Gold or Sugar till it hath been sunned and strained,
neither must you touch the Leaves of the _Rosa Solis_ with your hands
when you pick it; keep it very close.


20. _The Heart Water._

drams of Powder of Pearl, two drams of white Amber, two drams of
Cinamon, two pound of the best Prunes stoned, six Pints of Damask Rose

Water, two Pints of Red Rose water; then distil them in an ordinary
Still pasted up.

This is excellent for Swounding Fits or Convulsions, and expelleth any
venomous Disease; it also cureth any sort of Agues.


23. _The Snail water excellent for Consumptions._

Take a Peck of Snails with the Shells on their Backs, have in a
readiness a good fire of Charcoal well kindled, make a hole in the midst
of the fire, and cast your Snails into the fire, renew your fire till

have rubbed off all the green which will come off.

Then bruise them in a Mortar, shells and all, then take Clary,

Powder, and Storax, of each two ounces; strew one handful or two of your
Powders upon the Herbs, then distil them with a soft fire; tie a little
Musk in a piece of Lawn, and hang it in the Glass wherein it drops, and
when it is all drawn out, take your sweet Cakes and mix them with the
Powders which are left, and lay among your Clothes, or with sweet Oyles,
and burn them for perfume.


25. _A very good Surfet water._

Take what quantity of Brandy you please, steep a good quantity of the
Flowers of Red Poppies therein, which grow amongst the Wheat, having the
black bottoms cut off, when they have been steeped long enough, strain

them, and let it stand in the Sun all the while they infuse, then put in
Nutmegs, Cloves, Ginger and Cinamon, with some fine Sugar, so much as
you think fit, and keep it close stopped; this is very good for Surfets,
Wind in the Stomach, or any Illness whatever.


26. _An excellent Water for the Stomach, or against Infection._

Take Carduus, Mint and Wormwood, of each a like quantity, shred them
small and put them into new Milk, distil them in an ordinary Still with

Take some Rye Leaven, and break it small into some warm Water, let it be
a sowre one, for that is best; about two Ounces or more: then take a
Bushel of Elder Berries beaten small, and put them into an earthen Pot
and mix them very well with the Leaven, and let it stand one day near

257. _How to cover all kinds of Seeds, or little pieces of Spices, or
Orange or Limon Pill, with Sugar for Comfits._

First of all you mast have a deep bottomed Basin of Brass or Latin, with
two ears of Iron to hang it with two Cords over some hot Coals.

You must also have a broad Pan to put Ashes in, and hot Coals upon them.

You must have a Brass Ladle to let run the Sugar upon the Seeds.

You must have a Slice of Brass to scrape away the Sugar from the sides
of the hanging Basin if need be.

Having all these things in readiness, do as followeth;

Take fine white Sugar beaten, and let your Seeds and Spice be dry, then
dry them again in your hanging Basin:

Take to every two pounds of Sugar one quarter of a pound of Spices or
Seeds, or such like.

If it be Aniseeds, two pounds of Sugar to half a pound of Aniseeds, will
be enough.

Melt your Sugar in this manner, put in three Pounds of Sugar into the
Basin, and one Pint of Water, stir it well till it be wet, then melt it
very well and boil it very softly until it will stream from the Ladle
like Turpentine, and not drop, then let it seeth no more, but keep it
upon warm Embers, that it may run from the Ladle upon the seeds.

Move the Seeds in the hanging Basin so fast as you can or may, and with
one hand, cast on half a Ladle full at a time of the hot Sugar, and rub
the Seeds with your other hand a pretty while, for that will make them
take the Sugar the better, and dry them well after every Coat.

Do thus at every Coat, not only in moving the Basin, but also with
stirring of the Comfits with the one hand, and drying the same: in every
hour you may make three pounds of Comfits; as the Comfits do increase in
bigness, so you may take more Sugar in your Ladle to cast on:

But for plain Comfits, let your Sugar be of a light decoction last, and
of a high decoction first, and not too hot.

For crisp and ragged Comfits make your decoction so high, as that it may
run from the Ladle, and let it fall a foot high or more from the Ladle,
and the hotter you cast on your sugar, the more ragged will your Comfits
be; also the Comfits will not take so much of the sugar, as upon a
light decoction, and they will keep their raggedness long; this high
decoction must serve for eight or ten Coats, and put on at every time
but one Ladle full.

A quarter of a pound of Coriander seeds, and three pounds of sugar, will
serve for very great Comfits.

See that you keep your Sugar in the Basin always in good temper, that it
burn not in Lumps, and if at any time it be too high boiled, put in a
spoonful or two of water, and keep it warily with your Ladle, and let
your fire be always very clear, when your Comfits be made, set them in
Dishes upon Paper in the Sun or before the Fire, or in the Oven after
Bread is drawn, for the space of one hour or two, and that will make
them look very white.

and put in some sweet herbs or flowers, according to the time of the
year, boil it till a good part be consumed, and that it be very clear,
then set it to cool in several things, and when it is almost cold, work
it with yest, as you do Beer, the next day put it into the Vessel, and
so soon as it hath done working stop it up close, and when it hath stood
a fortnight, bottle it, this is a very wholesom Drink against any
Infection, or for any that are troubled with the Ptisick.


286. _For a Consumption, an excellent Medicine._

Take Shell Snails, and cast Salt upon them, and when you think they are
cleansed well from their slime, wash them, and crack their Shells and
take them off, then wash them in the distilled Water of Hysop, then put
them into a Bag made of Canvas, with some white Sugar Candy beaten, and
hang up the Bag, and let it drop as long as it will, which if you bruise
the Snails before you hang them up, it is the better; this Liquor taken
morning and evening a Spoonful at a time is very rare.


287. _A Suitable Dish for Lent._

Take a large Dish with broad Brims, and in the middle put blanched
Almonds round about them, Raisins of the Sun, and round them Figs, and
beyond them all coloured Jellies, and on the Brims Fig-Cheese.


288. _To make a Rock in Sweet-Meats._

First take a flat broad voiding Basket, then have in readiness a good
thick Plum Cake, then cut your Cake fit to the bottom of the Basket, and
cut a hole in the middle of it, that the foot of your Glass may go in,
which must be a Fountain-Glass, let it be as high a one as you can get;
put the foot of it in the hole of the Cake edgling that it may stand the
faster, then tie the Cake fast with a Tape to the Basket, first cross
one way and then another, then tie the foot of the Glass in that manner
too, that it may stand steady, then cut some odd holes in your Cake
carelesly, then take some Gum Dragon steeped in Rosewater, and mix it
with some fine Sugar, not too thick, and with that you must fasten all
your Rock together, in these holes which you cut in your Cake you must
fasten some sort of Biskets, as Naples Biskets, and other common Bisket
made long, and some ragged, and some coloured, that they may look like
great ill-favoured, Stones, and some handsome, some long, some short,
some bigger, and some lesser, as you know Nature doth afford, and some
of one colour and some of another, let some stand upright and some
aslannt, and some quite along, and fasten them all with your Gum, then
put in some better Sweet-meats, as Mackeroons and Marchpanes, carelesly
made as to the shape, and not put on the Rock in a set form, also some
rough Almond Cakes made with the long slices of Almonds (as I have
directed before;) so build it up in this manner, and fasten it with the
Gum and Sugar, till it be very high, then in some places you must put
whole Quinces Candied, both red and white, whole Orange Pills and Limon
Pills Candied; dried Apricocks, Pears and Pippins Candied, whole
Peaches Candied, then set up here and there great lumps of brown and
white Sugar-candy upon the stick, which much resembles some clusters of
fine Stones growing on a Rock; for Sand which lies sometimes among the
little Stones, strew some brown Sugar; for Moss, take herbs of a Rock
Candy; then you must make the likeness of Snakes and Snails and Worms,
and of any venomous Creature you can think of; make them in Sugar Plate
and colour them to their likeness, and put them in the holes that they
may seem to lurk, and some Snails creeping one way and some other; then
take all manner of Comfits, both rough and smooth, both great and small,
and colour many of them, some of one colour and some of another, let
some be white and some speckled, then when you have coloured them, and
that they are dry, mix them together and throw them into the Clefts, but
not too many in one place, for that will hide the shape of your work,
then throw in some Chips of all sorts of Fruit Candied, as Orange,
Limon, Citron, Quince, Pear, and Apples, for of all these you may make
Chips; then all manner of dryed Plumbs, and Cherries, Cornelions dryed,
Rasps and Currans; and in some places throw a few Prunelles, Pistacho
Nuts, blanched Almonds, Pine Kernels, or any such like, and a pound of
the great round perfumed Comfits; then take the lid off the top of the
Glass and fill it with preserved Grapes, and fill another with some
Harts-horn Jelly, place these two far from one another, and if you set
some kind of Fowl, made in Marchpanes, as a Peacock, or such like, and
some right Feathers gummed on with Gum Arabick, let this Fowl stand as
though it did go to drink at the Glass of Harts-horn Jelly, and then
they will know who see it, that those two liquid Glasses serve for
resemblance of several Waters in the Rock.

Then make good store of Oyster shells and Cockle shells of Sugar Plate,
let some be pure white as though the Sea water had washed them, some
brown on the outside, and some green, some as it were dirty, and others
worn away in some Places, some of them broke, and some whole, so set
them here and there about the Rock, some edgling, and some flat, some
the hollow side upward, and some the other, then stick the Moss, some
upon the shells, and some upon the stones, and also little branches of
Candied Fruits, as Barberries, Plums, and the like, then when all is
done, sprinkle it over with Rosewater, with a Grain or two of Musk or
Ambergreece in it; your Glass must be made with a reasonable proportion
of bigness to hold the Wine, and from that, in the middle of it, there
must be a Conveyance to fall into a Glass below it, which must have
Spouts for the Wine to play upward or downward, then from thence in
another Glass below, with Spouts also, and from thence it hath a
Conveyance into a Glass below that, somewhat in form like a Sillibub
Pot, where the Wine may be drunk out at the Spout; you may put some
Eringo Roots, and being coloured, they will shew very well among the
other Sweet-Meats, tie your Basket about with several sorts of small
Ribbons: Do not take this for a simple Fancy, for I assure you, it is
the very same that I taught to a young Gentlewoman to give for a Present
to a Person of Quality.




TO THE READER.


_Courteous Reader,

I Think it not amiss, since I have given you, as I think, a very full
Direction for all kinds of Food both for Nourishment and Pleasure, that

hath not a Rule, I shall therefore give you several Bills of Service for
Meals according to the Season of the Year, so that you may with ease
form up a Dinner in your Mind quickly; afterwards I shall speak of
ordering of Banquets; but these things first, because Banquets are most
proper after Meals.

to take it only as a_ Memorandum; _and to those who are yet unlearned, I
presume they will reap some Benefit by these Directions; which is truly
wished and desired by_

Now because I would have every one Compleat who have a Desire to serve
in Noble or Great Houses, I shall here shew them what their Office
requires; And,

First, _For the Kitchin, because without that we shall look lean, and
grow faint quickly._


The Cook, whether Man or Woman, ought to be very well skilled in all
manner of things both Fish and Flesh, also good at Pastry business,
seasoning of all things, and knowing all kinds of Sauces, and pickling
all manner of Pickles, in making all manner of Meat Jellies; also very
frugal of their Lords or of their Masters, Ladies or Mistresses Purse,
very saving, cleanly and careful, obliging to all persons, kind to
those under them, and willing to inform them, quiet in their Office, not
swearing nor cursing, nor wrangling, but silently and ingeniously to do
their Business, and neat and quick about it; they ought also to have a
very good Fancy: such an one, whether Man or Woman, deserves the title
of a fit Cook.

       *       *       *       *       *

_For a Maid under such a Cook._


She ought to be of a quick and nimble Apprehension, neat and cleanly in
her own habit, and then we need not doubt of it in her Office; not to
dress her self, specially her head, in the Kitchin, for that is
abominable sluttish, but in her Chamber before she comes down, and that
to be at a fit hour, that the fire may be made, and all things prepared
for the Cook, against he or she comes in; she must not have a sharp
Tongue, but humble, pleasing, and willing to learn; for ill words may
provoke Blows from a Cook, their heads being always filled with the
contrivance of their business, which may cause them to be peevish and
froward, if provoked to it; this Maid ought also to have a good Memory,
and not to forget from one day to another what should be done, nor to
leave any manner of thing foul at night, neither in the Kitchin, nor
Larders, to keep her Iron things and others clean scowred, and the
Floors clean as well as places above them, not to sit up junketing and
gigling with Fellows, when she should be in bed, such an one is a
Consumer of her Masters Goods, and no better than a Thief; and besides,
such Behaviour favoureth much of Levity. But such an one that will take
the Counsel I have seriously given, will not only make her Superiours
happy in a good Servant, but she will make her self happy also; for by
her Industry she may come one day to be Mistress over others.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Now to the Butler._


He ought to be Gentile and Neat in his Habit, and in his Behaviour,
courteous to all people, yet very saving of his Masters Goods, and to
order himself in his Office as a faithful Steward, charge and do all
things for the honour of his Master or Lady, not suffering their Wine or
Strong Drink to be devoured by ill Companions, nor the small to be drawn
out in waste, nor Pieces of good Bread to lie to mould and spoil, he
must keep his Vessels close stopped, and his Bottles sweet, his Cellars
clean washed, and his Buttery clean, and his Bread-Bins wholsom and
sweet, his Knives whetted, his Glasses clean washed that there be no
dimness upon them, when they come to be used, all his Plate clean and
bright, his Table, Basket and Linnen very neat, he must be sure to have
all things of Sauce ready which is for him to bring forth, that it may
not be to be fetched when it is called for, as Oil, Vinegar, Sugar,
Salt, Mustard, Oranges and Limons, and also some Pepper; he must also be
very neat and handy in laying the Clothes for the Chief Table, and also
the Side-boards, in laying his Napkins in several Fashions, and pleiting
them, to set his Glasses, Plate, and Trencher-Plates in order upon the
Side-boards, his Water-Glasses, Oranges or Limons; that he be careful to
set the Salts on the Table, and to lay a Knife, Spoon and Fork at every
Plate, that his Bread be chipped before he brings it in; that he set
drink to warm in due time if the season require; that he observe a fit
time to set Chairs or Stools, that he have his Cistern ready to set his
Drink in; that none be spilt about the Room, to wash the Glasses when
any one hath drunk, and to wait diligently on them at the Table, not
filling the Glasses too full; such an one may call himself a Butler.

       *       *       *       *       *

_To the Carver._


If any Gentleman who attends the Table, be employed or commanded to cut
up any Fowl or Pig, or any thing else whatsoever, it is requisite that
he have a clean Napkin upon his Arm, and a Knife and Fork for his use,
that he take that dish he should carve from the Table till he hath made
it ready for his Superiours to eat, and neatly and handsomly to carve
it, not touching of it so near as he can with his Fingers, but if he
chance unawares to do so, not to lick his Fingers, but wipe them upon a
Cloth, or his Napkin, which he hath for that purpose; for otherwise it
is unhandsom and unmannerly; the neatest Carvers never touch any Meat
but with the Knife and Fork; he must be very nimble lest the Meat cool
too much, and when he hath done, return it to the Table again, putting
away his Carving Napkin, and take a clean one to wait withal; he must be
very Gentile and Gallant in his Habit, lest he be deemed unfit to attend
such Persons.

       *       *       *       *       *

_To all other Men-Servants or Maid-Servants who commonly attend such
Tables._


They must all be neat and cleanly in their Habit, and keep their Heads
clean kembed, always ready at the least Call and very attentive to hear
any one at the Table, to set Chairs or Stools, and not to give any a
foul Napkin, but see that every one whom their Lord or Master is pleased
to admit to their Table, have every thing which is fit for them, and
that they change their Plates when need shall be; also that they observe
the eyes of a Stranger what they want, and not force them still to want
because they are silent, because it is not very modest for an Inferiour
to speak aloud before their Betters; and it is more unfit they should
want, since they have leave to eat and drink: they must wait diligently,
and at a distance from the Table, not daring to lean on the Chaires for
soiling them, or shewing Rudeness; for to lean on a Chair when they
wait, is a particular favour shewn to any superiour Servant, as the
Chief Gentleman, or the Waiting Woman when she rises from the Table;
they must not hold the Plates before their mouths to be defiled with
their Breath, nor touch them on the right side; when the Lord, Master,
Lady or Mistress shew that favour to drink to any Inferiour, and do
command them to fill for them to pledge them, it is not modesty for them
to deny Strangers that favour, as commonly they do, but to fulfill their
Commands, or else they dishonour the Favour.

When any Dish is taken off the Table, they must not set it down for Dogs
to eat, nor eat it themselves by the way, but haste into the Kitchin
with it to the Cook, that he may see what is to be set away, and what to
be kept hot for Servants; when all is taken away, and Thanks given, they
must help the Butler out with those things which belong to him, that he
may not lose his Dinner.

They must be careful also to lay the Cloth for themselves, and see that
nothing be wanting at the Table, and to call the rest of the Servants to
Meals, whose Office was not to wait at the Table, then to sit down in a
handsom manner, and to be courteous to every Stranger, especially the
Servants of those Persons whom their Lord or Master hath a kindness for.

If any poor Body comes to ask an Alms, do not shut the Door against them
rudely, but be modest and civil to them, and see if you can procure
somewhat for them, and think with your selves, that though you are now
full fed, and well cloathed, and free from care, yet you know not what
may be your condition another day: So much to Inferiour Servants.

_To the Gentlewomen who have the Charge of the Sweet-Meats, and such
like Repasts._


_Gentlewomen_,

Perhaps you do already know what belongs to serving in fine Cream
Cheeses, Jellies, Leaches or Sweet-meats, or to set forth Banquets as
well as I do; but (pardon me) I speak not to any knowing Person, but to
the Ignorant, because they may not remain so; besides really there are
new Modes come up now adays for eating and drinking, as well as for
Clothes, and the most knowing of you all may perhaps find somewhat here
which you have not already seen; and for the Ignorant, I am sure they
may ground themselves very well from hence in many accomplishments, and
truly I have taken this pains to impart these things for the general
good of my Country, as well as my own, and have done it with the more
willingness, since I find so many Gentlewomen forced to serve, whose
Parents and Friends have been impoverished by the late Calamities,
_viz._ the late Wars, Plague, and Fire, and to see what mean Places
they are forced to be in, because they want Accomplishments for better.

I am blamed by many for divulging these Secrets, and again commended by
others for my Love and Charity in so doing; but however I am better
satisfied with imparting them, than to let them die with me; and if I do
not live to have the Comfort of your Thanks, yet I hope it will cause
you to speak well of me when I am dead: The Books which before this I
have caused to be put in Print, found so good an acceptance, as that I
shall still go on in imparting what I yet have so fast as I can.

Now to begin with the Ordering those things named to you:

If it be but a private Dinner or Supper in a Noble House, where they
have none to honour above themselves, I presume it may be thus:

In Summer time, when the Meat is all taken away, you may present your
several sorts of Cream Cheeses; One Meal one Dish of Cream of one sort,
the next of another; one or two Scollop Dishes with several sorts of
Fruit, which if it be small fruit, as Rasps or Strawberries, they must
be first washed in Wine in a Dish or Bason, and taken up between two
Spoons, that you touch them not.

With them you may serve three or four small Dishes also with
Sweet-meats, such as are most in season, with Vine Leaves and Flowers
between the Dishes and the Plates, two wet Sweet-meats, and two dry, two
of one colour, and two of another, or all of several colours.

Also a Dish of Jellies of several colours in one Dish, if such be
required.

If any be left, you may melt them again, and put them into lesser
Glasses, and they will be for another time:

If any dry ones be left, they are soon put into the Boxes again.

If any persons come in the afternoon, if no greater, or so great as the
Person who entertains them, then you may present one or two Dishes of
Cream only, and a whipt Sillibub, or other, with about four Dishes of
Sweet-meats served in, in like manner as at Dinner, with Dishes of
Fruit, and some kind of Wine of your own making; at Evenings, especially
on Fasting Days at Night, it is fit to present some pretty kind of
Creams, contrary from those at Dinner, or instead of them some Possets,
or other fine Spoon Meats, which may be pleasant to the taste, with
some wet and dry Sweet-meats, and some of your fine Drinks, what may be
most pleasing.

At a Feast, you may present these things following.

So soon as the Meat is quite taken away, have in readiness your Cream
Cheeses of several sorts and of several of Colours upon a Salver, then
some fresh Cheese with Wine and Sugar, another Dish of Clouted Cream,
and a Noch with Cabbage Cream of several Colours like a Cabbage; then
all sorts of Fruits in season, set forth as followeth:

First, You must have a large Salver made of light kind of Wood, that it
may not be too heavy for the Servitor to carry, it must be painted over,
and large enough to hold six Plates round about and one larger one in
the middle, there must be places made in it to set the Plates in, that
they may be very fast and sure from sliding, and that in the middle the
seat must be much higher than all the rest, because that is most
graceful; your Plates must not be so broad as the Trencher Plates at
Meat, and should be either of Silver or China.

Set your Plates fast, then fill every one with several sorts of Fruits,
and the biggest sort in the middle, you must lay them in very good
order, and pile them up till one more will not lie; then stick them with
little green Sprigs and fine Flowers, such as you fancy best; then serve
in another such Salver, with Plates piled up with all manner of
Sweet-meats, the wet Sweet-meats round about and the dry in the middle,
your wet Sweet-meats must be in little glasses that you may set the more
on, and between every two glasses another above the first of all, and
one on the top of them all; you must put of all sorts of dryed
Sweet-meats in the middle Plate, first your biggest and then your
lesser, till you can lay no more; then stick them all with Flowers and
serve them: And in the Bason of Water you send in to wash the Hands or
Fingers of Noble Persons, you must put in some Orange Flower Water,
which is very rare and very pleasant.

In Winter you must alter, as to the season, but serve all in this
manner; and then dryed Fruits will also be very acceptable; as dryed
Pears and Pippins, Candied Oranges and Limons, Citrons and Eringoes,
Blanched Almonds, Prunelles, Figs, Raisins, Pistachoes and Blanched
Walnuts.

Now good Readers, here are three hundred and ten choice Receipts added
for a Second Part of the _Queen-like Closet_, and you may, I am sure,
make many more of them if you observe how many I have taught in one; if
I had not taken that course, only for brevity sake, & that it might not
be tedious and impertinent to you, I might have enlarged this Volume
very much.


_FINIS._

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
