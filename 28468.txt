FINANCIAL--SIX MONTHS.


The first six months of the present fiscal year of the American
Missionary Association closed March 31st. The receipts are
$18,961.74 more than for the same period last year. The increase in
donations is $10,699, and in estates $6,433.24, exclusive of the
reserve legacy account. The tuition and similar receipts are
$1,829.49 more than last year. This is a favorable and encouraging
showing. We gratefully acknowledge the generosity of the friends of
the great missionary work carried on by this Association, as evident
in their increased donations.

The payments during this period have been $17,595 more than for the
same months last year. The net balance, exclusive of the reserve
legacy account, is $1,366.74 more favorable than that for the first
six months of last year. The increase in current receipts has been
expended in the mission fields which have been so greatly crippled
by the enforced retrenchments during recent years.

The Association rejoices in its freedom from debt and in the
favorable showing for these first six months. The next six months
include the summer season, in which missionary gifts are often
greatly reduced and the income suffers. We would again remind the
pastors, Sunday-school superintendents, officers of Endeavor
Societies and Woman's Missionary Circles of the great and pressing
need upon the Association, both in old and new fields, among the
many millions for whom our faithful missionaries labor. Porto Rico
demands increased gifts. The field is opening with great hopefulness
both in educational and evangelistic lines. Word comes from
missionaries there urging reinforcements, which means more
consecrated money to meet this pressing necessity.

A WORD AS TO THE MAGAZINE.


Letters frequently come to the editor of this magazine expressing
regret that it does not reach the subscriber regularly each month.
No one can regret this fact more than the editor. It must be
remembered that the magazine is no longer a monthly, but a
quarterly. This reduction in the frequency of the issue of our
periodical was found necessary by the Executive Committee during the
hard financial conditions through which we have recently passed. In
order to economize in the expenditures, the four numbers per year
were decided upon. The economy was necessary. The disadvantages,
however, are very apparent. Large space in each magazine is
necessarily occupied by the statistical report of receipts. This is
essential. It is an important financial safeguard and an evidence of
the thorough business administration of the Association.

However, less space is left for general matter. Partially on account
of this restriction of space the magazine has taken a slightly
different complexion. It is our desire to present as complete as
possible the nature and conditions of the missionary work in our
various fields. The discussion of incidental or even fundamental
problems connected with the work of this Association is not often
possible. Those who contribute to this work either money or prayers
have a right to know what is being accomplished. Nothing can present
it so clearly as illustrated articles, prepared by those who are in
these mission fields. In the current issue two important schools are
presented in this way.

In the Department of Christian Endeavor the development of work
among the young people of the Highlands is interestingly presented.
During the current year we plan to present our secondary
institutions as the higher institutions were presented--through
illustrated articles during the last year.

We acknowledge with gratitude the pleasant words spoken concerning
the AMERICAN MISSIONARY in various periodicals. The cordial notices
in missionary cotemporaries of other denominations, and those of our
own mission schools, is especially appreciated.

A commission consisting of two members of the Executive Committee
have recently visited the mission field. Rev. E. S. Tead, of Boston,
and President T. J. Backus, of Brooklyn, were selected by the
committee for this special service. They were accompanied by the
senior secretary, Rev. A. F. Beard, and through a part of the field
by Sec. G. H. Gutterson, of the New England District. They carefully
inspected several of the schools of the Association, and their visit
was of great value. The testimony they bear to the efficiency of the
work and to the interests of the field is pronounced and emphatic.
In a future issue of this magazine we hope to present articles from
members of this commission which will be of great interest to our
readers. The testimony of an experienced pastor and prominent
educator must have great weight.

Strong testimony to the value of the educational work among the
negroes is found in _Harpers' Weekly_ for February 10th. In an able
editorial on "Negro Education," we find the following: "The storm
and stress period of the South is still upon it. The curse of
slavery has not yet been removed. But it is clear that the schools
are sending the light into the dark places, and that everything that
shuts off or reduces the brilliancy of the light is inimical not
only to the negro, but to the whites themselves, to the South, and
to the whole country." No truer word than this could be spoken. The
education of the negro is not a question of sectional or local
importance alone. It is fundamental to the safety and development of
our country. There are in the Southern public schools 27,445
teachers employed in teaching negroes. Twenty-six per cent. of the
average attendance of school children in the Southern States,
including the District of Columbia, are negroes. The total
enrollment of the blacks constitute, however, only 52 per cent. of
the children of that race of school age. This fact again emphasizes
the necessity of such schools as the American Missionary Association
plants among these black people. The high grade and exceptional
character of these schools are certainly worthy of commendation. The
report of our commissioners based upon facts personally and
independently gathered by each will present the conditions as they
are. The years of heroic and sacrificial service on the part of a
body of missionaries and teachers, unsurpassed in any field, are
bringing their legitimate and noble fruitage.

FIFTY-FOURTH ANNUAL MEETING.


Springfield, Mass., has set the doors of its hospitality wide open
in its welcome to the Fifty-fourth Annual Meeting of the American
Missionary Association. This city occupies an ideal position for
such a convention. It is the center of many railroad lines, both
steam and electric. A large population are resident in the towns and
cities and countryside, easily accessible through these lines of
transportation. It is so located geographically that many of our
most populous states are within easy distance. Add to this the
cordial enthusiasm of the churches and citizens who invite the
Association, and we have every element of a great and inspiring
meeting. Already committees are organized and arrangements are being
perfected for this meeting.

Full particulars will be given in a future number of the MISSIONARY,
and in our Congregational papers. Rev. Philip S. Moxom, D.D.,
Springfield, Mass., is the chairman of the general committee, and
will receive and pass over to the proper sub-committee any
correspondence which may reach him.

TILLOTSON COLLEGE, AUSTIN, TEXAS.

M. R. GAINES, PRESIDENT.


[Illustration: ALLEN HALL, TILLOTSON COLLEGE]

January 17, 1881, witnessed the opening of this institution. It was
christened "Tillotson Institute." The age of "romance" in the
education of the negro was well-nigh passed. The matter-of-fact
brain of the late Rev. George J. Tillotson, of Wethersfield, Conn.,
formulated the plan, and his generous heart enabled him, with the
aid of individual contributors and the American Missionary
Association, to carry his plan into execution. His purpose was to
give the negroes of this far-away Southwest opportunities for
securing an education equal to those of any other portion of our
fair land. With this end in view he visited Austin and secured an
ideal site for the coming college, destined to become the "Yale of
the Southwest." Austin contains the magnificent Capitol, the State
University, St. Edward's College and other schools, public and
private, besides the state institutions for the insane, the blind,
the deaf, the aged soldier and the orphan. Within the limits of the
city, and yet removed from its din and dust, commanding views of
many of these buildings, and of the far-reaching valley of the
Colorado and the wooded hills beyond, our campus of twenty acres is
a delight to the eye. Undulating, well suited for drainage, well
stocked with shade trees and a profusion of wild flowers in their
season, it is at once beautiful, healthful and inspiring.

[Illustration: CARPENTER SHOP, TILLOTSON COLLEGE.]

The first building erected on this lot was Allen Hall. It stands on
a hill of easy ascent, and is a substantial structure of stone and
brick, five stories in height. While it was approaching completion,
as story after story was added, the ambitious and intelligent young
colored people watched its growth, eagerly anticipating the time
when they would "enter its basement and ascend story by story, till
they should step out upon the roof full-fledged college graduates."

Money for the purchase of the lot came mostly from Mr. Tillotson's
own purse. His efforts in soliciting funds were largely instrumental
in securing the means for erecting and furnishing the building. The
list of contributors to this part of the undertaking included the
names of men well known for their literary works, philanthropy,
patriotism and fidelity to the Saviour of Men. Most of those early
donors have passed from earth, but they are still an inspiration to
all engaged in the work, and we of this generation can clasp hands
with them in the purpose and effort to make real their intentions.
Though dead "their works do follow them."

For fourteen years Allen Hall afforded all the space available for
dormitories for teachers and students of both sexes, dining-room,
study-room, recitation rooms, chapel and church services. A series
of partitions divided each floor, from basement to attic, into east
and west halls. A small addition in the rear served for kitchen.

[Illustration: BOYS IN CARPENTER SHOP, TILLOTSON COLLEGE.]

At the opening of the school there was no charge for tuition. The
aspirants for an education "without money and without price" carried
the enrollment to a point never since reached in the history of the
school.

In 1888 the carpenters' shop was built and industrial training was
introduced. An appropriation of $900 from the Slater Fund aided in
meeting the additional expense. A marked evidence of the
appreciation of this advance is shown in the record of attendance,
which increased nearly eighty per cent., and reached the highest
figures it has ever done under a charge for tuition.

A material enlargement to the accommodations for teachers and
students came in 1894, in the new Girls' Hall, that was occupied for
the first time in the autumn of that year. This was erected with
funds provided by the American Missionary Association, and is a
beautiful and convenient structure. The main part is three and a
half stories in height, with wing and rear extension two and a half
stories in height. It contains kitchen, dormitories and
sitting-rooms for teachers and girls, and a spacious, airy and
attractive dining hall for all.

The same year a new charter was obtained and the name changed to
"Tillotson College."

[Illustration: DINING ROOM, GIRLS' HALL, TILLOTSON COLLEGE.]

The Tillotson Church of Christ in Austin was organized January 4,
1885. Rev. J. E. Roy, D.D., Rev. Jeremiah Porter, D.D., and Rev. J.
H. Parr, conducted the services. Twelve members were received by
letter and seven on profession. While a large majority of the
students are members of churches at entrance, comparatively few have
joined the church of the school. The entire enrollment of active
members has been one hundred and eleven. This, by no means, gives a
fair indication of the Christian spirit and activity of the school.
In the religious meetings there is never any reference to
denominational or sectarian differences.

On the 1st of February, 1899, the church adopted the "Mt. Holyoke
Plan" of a "Wayside Covenant," and thirty-five teachers and students
have signed that and entered into fellowship with us, while
retaining membership in their own churches.

Porter Chapel, erected for outside missionary work in a needy part
of the city, has had a checkered but useful experience. Once it was
burned. It was rebuilt in 1890. Here Miss Martha J. Adams was wont
to meet people, young and old, and dispense aid and comfort along
many lines. Here, too, have been held for many years Sunday-school
services, and preaching services from time to time, as strength and
opportunity allowed.

[Illustration: MECHANICAL DRAUGHTING CLASS, TILLOTSON COLLEGE.]

In the early years there were a few students, mostly children of
teachers, in college courses, and a still smaller number in
theology. The aim from the first has been to give instruction in the
elements of a good common school education, and to provide advanced
work for such as could complete a high school course, or were
preparing to teach, or to continue their studies in higher
professional schools elsewhere. The list of graduates is still a
short one. The motto, "QUALITY NOT QUANTITY," finds its illustration
here as in all the rest of the work of the school. The standard of
scholarship has always been high and is steadily advancing. Many who
have never graduated have done excellent work as teachers in the
public schools of the state. "Tillotson" students are in demand and
are known and respected for their honesty and reliability. Of the
graduates, some are in responsible positions in this state, while
others are pursuing courses of study in higher institutions at the
North, or have already entered upon professional work. The great
work of such a school is in its "leveling up." Who shall measure
this? When a boy on retiring at night folds and carefully lays away
the sheets and pillow slips from his bed, to "keep them clean," or
when he thinks, on entering the dining-room, that he has "reached
heaven," evidently there is room for such work.

Teachers and students together strive to make Tillotson a place of
refined and Christian culture. The chapel bell calls all to morning
prayers, on school days, and to Sunday-school, church services and
Christian Endeavor, on Sundays. Each evening the family gathers
about the Word at its altar in the dining-room. Bible-study is a
part of the regular course through all the grades.

[Illustration: SEWING CLASS, TILLOTSON COLLEGE.]

Twenty years is a short time for estimating the harvest from such
sowing as this. The beginning was small. The annals are meagre. Here
have labored earnest and consecrated men and women from the best
institutions of the North. The citizens of Austin have always been
sympathetic and helpful. Several of the most prominent of them have
served on the board of trustees. Many of them have contributed
towards the equipment of the industrial departments of the school.

A small blacksmith shop on the place was a gift of the business men
of Austin. The colored patrons of the school, in all sections of the
state, have always been most cordial and enthusiastic in their
commendation and confidence. It is little wonder that, with the
passing of the years, the school has grown steadily in the
estimation and affection of all classes. In the early days, the hall
at commencement was occupied largely by white people. In these later
years the audiences are composed largely of intelligent and
appreciative colored people.

When one considers the scanty equipment of the school he can but be
surprised that it has accomplished so much.

[Illustration: CLASS GROUP, TILLOTSON COLLEGE.]

Endowment, aside from land and buildings, it has none. For income it
has always depended upon grants by the American Missionary
Association from its own funds and the Daniel Hand estate, the
direct contributions of individuals, and payments by the students
for board and tuition. The intention is to make the expenses for
students as light as possible. After the first session the charges
for tuition were fixed for the grammar department at $2.00 per
month; for the normal department at $2.50 per month; for board and
tuition together $12.00 per month. In 1887 the tuition for the
grammar department was dropped to $1.00 per month. The other charges
remained in force for ten years, when the tuition was made the same
for all, $1.00 per month. To meet the necessities of the case we are
forced to allow our students to work out at least half of these very
moderate charges. Nearly all the manual labor about the institution
is done by students. Thus, in a very practical way, they help
themselves pecuniarily and acquire knowledge of housekeeping in its
manifold lines.

To train the hand as well as the head the boys receive instruction
in carpentry and industrial draughting, and the girls have regular
lessons in needlework, dress-making and kindred subjects.

[Illustration: GIRLS' HALL, TILLOTSON COLLEGE.]

Tillotson has always done good work. She has made a name for
herself. Standing, as she does, for thoroughgoing, non-sectarian,
Christian education, for true manhood and womanhood, with mutual
co-operation and helpfulness, with so many from all parts of this
great State of Texas looking to her for light and leadership, her
opportunities for usefulness are out of all proportion to her means.
To properly meet these demands she sorely needs many things. A full
list of imperative needs would call for too much space. A few must
suffice.

A reasonable sum of money for endowment of professorships.

A great addition to apparatus and appliances for experiment and
instruction.

Refurnishing of present buildings from top to bottom.

Sanitary drainage and plumbing.

A neat and pleasant chapel. A library and reading-room, with funds
to purchase new books.

An extension to complete girl's hall, on the present plan, affording
needed rooms for girls and teachers.

Music rooms removed from study and recitation rooms.

A building, with power, for metal working, tinsmithing, etc.

A plant for typesetting and printing.

Additional teachers should be employed, and the courses of study
extended, so that men fully equipped for the demands of the new
century can be furnished here.

Tillotson thus sends forth her plea to Christian men and women all
over our land to be used as the means of untold blessing to needy
thousands. Her usefulness has been great. It can be indefinitely
increased with comparatively small outlay. Here are grand
opportunities for investment in "futures" that will yield large
returns. Just after the death of the late Dr. Joseph Hardy Neesima,
of Japan, who had been so generously aided by Hon. Alpheus Hardy, of
Boston, who had also died not long before, a Christian friend
wrote:--"I wonder what Mr. Hardy thinks now of his investment in
Joseph Hardy Neesima." They both can now realize so much more fully
the meaning of the Master's words: "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto
one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto ME."

More than ordinary interest attaches to this institution for the
education of colored youth and the training of colored teachers,
located as it is in the very cradle of secession, and near the spot
from which was fired the first gun in the long war waged for their
perpetual enslavement; and in a city situated in the heart of the
cotton and rice-fields of the Southland.

[Illustration: AVERY NORMAL INSTITUTE, CHARLESTON, S. C.]

Scarcely had the smoke of the long conflict cleared away or civil
authority been fully restored in this long-besieged city, when
General Saxton, then Assistant Commissioner of the Freedmen's
Bureau, opened a school in the Memminger building on St. Philip
Street, built for and since used for the education of white
children. Here, on the first day of October, 1865, were gathered a
thousand children eager for the education so long denied to their
race. So great was the pressure to gain admission to this school
that one hundred children were seated in the great dome that
surmounts the edifice.

The studies during the first year embraced the entire range of
elementary branches, from the primer to the Latin grammar. About
three-fourths of those who attended this first school were children
of freedmen; the others, making up the advanced classes, were born
free and constituted an aristocracy of color, a distinction which,
after a lapse of more than a third of a century, still exists.

The closing examinations of this first year were attended by a large
audience of both white and colored. There were present ladies and
gentlemen, missionaries and teachers, civil and military
dignitaries, and the leading representatives of both races. It was a
novel and moving sight, one that the wildest imagination could not
have foreseen or deemed possible five years before.

[Illustration: PROF. M. A. HOLMES, PRINCIPAL.]

In its second year the school, then known as the Saxton School, held
its sessions in the Military Hall on Wentworth Street, where with a
slightly reduced enrollment, it remained until removed to its
present quarters, May 1, 1865. The large and handsome building which
it now occupies was erected by the American Missionary Association
through the Freedmen's Bureau. Rev. Charles Avery, of Pittsburg,
Pa., had given a large sum for the education of the colored people,
and ten thousand dollars of his bequest were appropriated to the
institution, and in honor of this noble philanthropist the name was
changed to Avery Normal Institute. Here the enrollment was
necessarily reduced and the normal character of its work made more
prominent, a feature that had been contemplated from the beginning.

In any survey of the work of Avery, three principals should receive
special recognition for their thorough, enduring and Christian labor
in this needy field. They are the Rev. F. S. Cardozo, by whom the
school was first organized in the Memminger building, Prof. M. A.
Warren, who succeeded him and graduated the first class in 1872, and
Prof. Amos W. Farnham, now of the Oswego Normal School. Each of
these men was distinguished for unusual teaching skill, for great
administrative ability, and for complete consecration to the work to
which he was specially called. These worthy educators are still
remembered here with affection and gratitude, but the full fruition
of their labors will be known only in the great day when the books
shall be opened.

For over thirty years about four hundred colored students have
annually gathered here for the training which was to fit them for
life's work. For many years all grades, from the primary to the high
school and normal course, were maintained, but in later years the
primary and intermediate pupils have been excluded, their
instruction being amply provided for in the public and numerous
private schools of the city, thus leaving the Institute free to
devote itself to higher grades and normal work, in which Avery has
been from the first conspicuous and eminently successful. Its
graduates now number nearly four hundred and are found in almost
every department of human activity. Some are distinguished in
professional life, others in trade, or in business. Among them are
doctors, skilled and eminent in their chosen fields of labor,
clergymen of acknowledged ability, and teachers of long and
successful experience. About two-thirds of all its graduates choose
teaching as their special vocation; and nearly all prove their skill
and ability in the schoolroom, and have reflected great credit on
their alma mater and have been a blessing to their race. There has
been for the last ten years a steady and growing demand for colored
teachers of ability and with special training for their work; and
there is not a county in the state to which our graduates do not go
as teachers, and in the lower counties and along this malarial coast
nearly all the schools for colored children are taught by Avery
graduates. In many places conditions are such that no one can
undertake this work without jeopardizing health or risking life
itself. But there are not wanting those whom zeal and devotion lead
into these dangerous fields. Names might be given of those who have
even given up life itself at work in these malarial districts,
proving their zeal and the missionary spirit which actuated them.

Avery has cost large sums of money; to maintain such an institution
by charity through a third of a century is no small undertaking,
requiring faith and consecration. But it has repaid more than a
hundred-fold all that has ever been expended. Here in this historic
city, surrounded by lowlands of rice and cotton, the negro was found
in overwhelming numbers, and after emancipation, in utter ignorance
of book lore or a pure gospel. To this people the American
Missionary Association, through the Avery Institute and its
consecrated workers, has brought the light of knowledge and a pure
gospel, and awakened aspiration and hope of a better life. The
beneficial effects of this work upon such a people, and indirectly
upon the city and state, are incalculable. Intelligent Christianity
and Christian education has ever been the motto of Avery, and
faithfully has it been realized in the lives of its graduates, and
exemplified by them in all the relations that affect good
citizenship and true manhood. Race conflicts in this city have been
unknown since the days of reconstruction, and it is not too much to
claim that this better condition of things here is largely due to
the influence exerted by Avery.

[Illustration: NORMAL CLASS OF 1900, IN CHAPEL.]

Although it is in the strictest sense a school, in which all studies
in every department are prosecuted under a high pressure, which
knows no relaxation, yet religious teaching has ever been a
prominent feature, and the Bible is considered the best text book in
the school. It has never been sectarian, but always Christian in its
teaching and influence. No year passes without numerous conversions
among its pupils, and every church in the city has been blessed in
some measure by accessions to its membership from the students of
Avery.

The blessings which this school has brought to this people, and
indirectly to a far wider constituency, are not wholly a free gift
to them. A monthly tuition fee has always been required and
collected from all in attendance, except in special cases, in which
its collection would impose great hardship or compel the withdrawal
of worthy pupils from the school. But in spite of this monthly
charge and the sacrifices made to meet it and keep their children in
school, these people, out of their meagre earnings, which in so many
cases make accumulations impossible, have kept their children in
school, and to the end of a twelve years' course, in numbers that
would shame many a more prosperous community in more favored
sections of our land, where schools and books are entirely free. In
1895 twenty-four successfully completed its course and graduated
with honor; in 1896 twenty were added to the alumni roll; in 1897
twenty-eight; in 1898 thirty-one; in 1899 twenty-four; and at this
writing twenty-four are taking final examinations for graduation in
June. And from these large classes there is not one that is not an
honor to the community, scarcely one that has not found a position
as a teacher or in some useful calling or industry, while a few are
taking higher courses in other institutions. Are not these facts
sufficient answer to the charge so often made, that the colored
people are losing their interest in education, or that higher
education does not benefit them?

Our work has been mainly academic; that is the purpose for which
Avery was called into existence, to educate and train colored
teachers, and to fit them for honorable positions in trade or
business.

The dignity of labor has always been faithfully inculcated, and
opportunities for it have not been wanting. Nearly all the normal
students and many in the lower classes go from school to some useful
occupation, learning trades, or engaging in other remunerative
employment. Large numbers not only maintain themselves but are
necessary helpers to the bread-winners of their respective families.

But in keeping with the tendencies of the times and of the newer
education, and with the traditions and practice of the American
Missionary Association, an industrial department has been added to
Avery, and it has aroused no little enthusiasm among students and
patrons. Needlework for the girls has been introduced, and under an
accomplished and efficient instructor it has been from the first a
great success. The girls from the lower grades as well as from the
normal classes are being systematically trained to do their own
sewing, and will in time be taught to make their own garments. Our
purpose is to add to this, cooking and other departments of domestic
science, as the resources of the Association will permit. Steps have
been taken to establish a printing department.

In 1892 Avery Normal Institute was incorporated under the laws of
the state, though the control of the school has been kept in the
same hands as before, a majority of the trustees being in the
executive committee or the administrative force of the American
Missionary Association. The purpose of the incorporation was to
secure for its graduates the advantages which the laws of the state
confer upon graduates of all incorporated institutions.

[Illustration: SEWING CLASS, SIXTH GRADE.]

An article of this nature would be incomplete without some reference
to charges so frequently made, and in high places too, that
education, and especially the higher education, does the negro more
harm than good, and that the educated classes furnish the larger
part of the criminals. That there are educated criminals is not
doubted, but they are not confined to one race, nor do they come
from the students of the American Missionary Association schools. Of
the nearly four hundred living graduates of Avery, not one is a
criminal nor has one ever been accused of crime, and the writer has
yet to learn of more than two who have proved unworthy of the
training they have received, or dishonored their alma mater by
immoral lives. These fell under a stress of circumstances that would
have ruined almost any young person. On the contrary, the graduates
of this and other schools under the auspices of the Association are
conspicuous for worthy and upright character, for thrift, for
industry and good citizenship.

And this is true not only of those who complete our course and
receive their diplomas, but of hundreds of others who do not go
beyond the grammar grades. Such invariably make better citizens. It
is a rare thing to learn that one of the students from any class of
our school has become a criminal. The criminal classes are not
recruited from the pupils in missionary schools.


OUR NEEDS.

We need large contributions of money or materials that will enable
us to enlarge and develop our industrial department. A promising
beginning has been made, but it is only a beginning, and we desire
to extend it in many lines, giving the widest possible scope to
individual talent or proclivities, without lowering in any degree
the present standard of scholastic attainment.

We need contributions of money and books to enlarge our library and
give to our students advantages which they cannot now find in the
city. A good library is absolutely indispensable in all educational
work. We have a few hundred well worn volumes, the merest apology
for a library, but it is the only one in the city to which colored
people have access.

We appeal to individuals, to Sunday-schools, to Christian Endeavor
societies and to churches for the establishment of scholarships for
worthy and capable pupils. We have many such, on whom the burdens
press so heavily that continuance in school to the end of the course
is an impossibility. We wish to help such after they have reached
the normal department. A small sum expended in keeping these worthy
students in the school may bring rich rewards when the harvests of
life are all finally gathered.

SOUTHERN FIELD NOTES.

GEORGE W. MOORE, FIELD MISSIONARY.


Early in the school year the teachers of Trinity School, Athens,
Alabama, made their annual visitation to the country people. They
carried with them the good cheer of the holiday season in the
distribution of odds and ends from barrels from Northern friends.
Gifts were distributed to a hundred persons, old and young. One old
lady, fearing that she had been overlooked, exclaimed: "Wat you
gwine to gib me?" and she was made happy by the gift of a bandanna
handkerchief. Trinity School fills a large place in that community,
as it is the only school for colored pupils in a radius of several
miles of Athens.

A revival followed the week of prayer service at Talladega College.
The school is full, and all are happy in the work.

Secretary Beard's trip through the Southern field was a delight to
the workers and students. His sermons and addresses and wise counsel
were helpful to all. Porto Rico was made very real by his graphic
descriptions of the country and people.

Our church at Shelby Iron Works, Ala., is flourishing under the
labors of Rev. E. E. Scott. Mr. Scott, with his rich tenor voice,
leads the people in the singing of the old spirituals, and the choir
in anthems and song.

Rev. T. J. Bell and his people are doing good service at Selma.

Miss M. L. Phillips and her associates are happy in their work at
Marion, Ala. A deep religious interest was awakened both at Marion,
Ala., and at our Lincoln School at Meridian, Miss. Rev. M. Jones, a
graduate of Tougaloo University, is pastor at Meridian, and Rev. C.
L. Harris, the former minister, is now at Mobile.

The Emerson Institute at Mobile is doing excellent work, under the
direction of Dr. Burnell and his teachers.

The meeting of the Louisiana Association was held with the Central
Church, New Orleans. The attendance was good, and the reports of the
churches, addresses and papers were full of interest.

The Woman's Missionary Union, Christian Endeavor and Sunday-school
Association also held interesting meetings.

The Straight University has a large attendance; the school is making
good progress in its various departments of literary and industrial
work.

After the meeting of the Louisiana Association, I visited the work
at Thibodeaux, Schriever, Chacahoula, Abbeville, Lake Charles and
New Iberia. At several places a deep religious interest was
awakened, and a large number avowed their faith in the Saviour.

A new church has been organized at Lake Charles, La., with thirty
members. It gives promise of growth and fruitful service. Rev. S. J.
Wood, a graduate of Straight University, is pastor. The people
bought a lot, and the Church-Building Society aided them in buying a
meeting-house which has been removed to their lot.

Three miles from Fort Davis Station, on the Georgia and Alabama
Railroad, and forty miles from Montgomery, is our Cotton Valley
School, which is located in the heart of the Black Belt of Alabama.
This country school is the one bright spot in the lives of the
large population of poor black people of Cotton Valley. It is in
charge of four young women, graduates of Fisk University--Miss
Carrie Alexander, Principal, and Misses Pearl Binford, Lelia Haynie
and Lizzie B. Moore. Besides the school work, the teachers visit the
people in their cabin homes, hold mothers' meetings, Sunday-school,
Christian Endeavor and Junior Endeavor meetings, sewing classes, a
literary society and singing-school. It is a veritable social
settlement. The people look to these young women for advice,
medicine and help in all kinds of ways. They have won the love and
confidence of the people, and gladly help them in all ways. The
school is under the management of the American Missionary
Association, and is supported by the Woman's Missionary Union of
Massachusetts. The school is located in a most needy field for
mission work. A teachers' home is greatly needed. The teachers
occupy the log cabin home built by the first missionary teacher,
Mrs. Lillian V. Courtney, _nee_ Davis. This cabin home has done good
service; but a larger home is needed for the teachers, with
facilities for industrial training for girls.

BITS OF EXPERIENCE IN THE INDIAN COUNTRY.

MISS M. P. LORD.


Little-Dog was very sick, they said. We thought of the beautiful
two-year-old boy whom he had loved with all a father's tenderness,
and of the day when he had come and told us of the child's death;
and how his eyes were still inflamed with weeping; and how grateful
he was for the little food, and for the words of comfort we had
tried to give him.

His home was ten or fifteen miles up the winding river, with two
fording-places between. We found at the first a broad, swift stream,
swollen by a recent rain. We were glad we had made preparations
before starting in, for the water flowed six inches deep over the
buggy floor. At the village beyond, Cross-Bear advised us to return
by another road, as the river was still rising. Long-Feather, with
whose family we also stopped to shake hands, gave the same advice,
saying that he would see us safely over the next crossing, but that
he was just starting on a long drive in the opposite direction.
Good-Boy, who lived near the fording-place, would help, he said. So,
following directions, Good-Boy was found. His pony was quickly
saddled, and galloping on ahead he piloted us not only to the
river-crossing, but all the way to Little Dog's, some miles beyond.

Mrs. Little-Dog and ten-year-old Martin greeted us at the door, and
inside the house we were cordially welcomed by the blind and almost
helpless sufferer. The wife said, "I wanted to go and get medicine
for him, but there was no one to take care of him while I was gone."
They were miles from the nearest neighbor. And the sick man added,
"I didn't like to have our little boy go so far alone." When the
physical pain and needs were relieved so far as possible, I asked if
there was a Bible. In answer the sick man turned and reached under
the pillow at the farther corner of the bed, from which he drew out
a little bag, and from that he carefully--almost tenderly, it
seemed--took his Dakota Bible and handed me. Such times of drawing
near to God, in the homes of sick or sorrowing ones, mean quite as
much of added strength and cheer to the white visitor as to those
who are visited, and we always come away feeling so glad that we
went. Tears were in the woman's eyes as the good-byes were said; and
the little boy, with his pony saddled, watched us out of sight, to
be sure that we were started on the right road home, as we had been
directed.

On another day we heard that our good old friend
Afraid-of-the-Clouds had been thrown from his wagon and badly hurt.
We found the tall figure, which we had always been accustomed to see
so erect and soldierly in bearing, stretched on the ground in his
tent, silent and motionless. With evident pain and effort the dear
old man tried to explain how it happened. He did not complain and
spoke very gently, but the expression of suffering on the wrinkled
face made me fear he would never get up again, and my own sorrow at
the thought was hard to conceal. He was only (?) an "old Indian,"
one of those "old Indians" who are often so lightly spoken of as of
no account; but whose dignity and strength of character, and gentle,
gracious courtesy, command the respect of those who really know
them. And he had been a loyal friend and faithful helper in the
years that we had been neighbors. And though he still clung to his
old faith, he seemed as grateful for the reading of God's Word and
prayer as for the material help we tried to give.

Time passed, and by-and-by he was up and about again, and wanted to
be given some work to do. One day he came into the house and seated
himself in the deliberate way which told that he had something on
his mind, which would demand my undivided attention, and said: "You
are a white woman. I am a Dakota. But when I was sick your heart was
sad. I hold it in my heart." That was all; that and the silent
hand-grasp as he went out. But somehow I felt as if what the old man
felt in his heart was very secure there.

One bright Sabbath morning, with our deacon, One-Thunder, we visited
a neighboring church eight or ten miles up the river. The regular
native teacher was away, attending the great annual mission meeting;
but two other young men had been appointed to take charge of the
service together--Anselm Kill-the-Crow and Clinton High-Horse. The
latter took for his text, "Ye are the salt of the earth." Retaining
the figurative form of the verse, the young preacher made clear its
spiritual teaching, and by his direct and forceful application
revealed the thoughtfulness and earnestness of his own heart. The
remarks of the other alluded to the name chosen for the little
church. "The Church of the Messiah;" and he urged upon those present
that it be not in name only, but in deed and in truth, _His_ church.
The after-service greetings to the visitors were cordial, as
usual--even the babies being encouraged to hold out tiny brown
hands, with their mothers' injunctions to "nape yuza" (shake hands).

Hole-in-his-Tooth, who is always eager to take orders during the
plum season, consented to postpone business transactions until the
next day. The Woman's Missionary Society had five dollars to hand
over, to be forwarded to the "Wotanin Waste;" that is, far
missionary work. Everybody seemed wide awake and happy; and as we
drove away, the Y. M. C. A. were about to hold their services.

Next to their interest in church affairs, is that in the school; for
since the Grand River (Government) Boarding School has demonstrated
in their midst what faithful teachers can do for the children, the
whole community are ready to show their appreciation, from good old
Chief Grindstone to the wee little folk who carry flowers to their
white friends in the school; and every little circle of influence
widens.

The blizzard was fiercely raging outside, lashing the little house
in its fury. I had given up trying to warm more than one room, and
that was darkened by the snow piled against the windows, and the
panes above were so thick with frost that nothing could be seen.

The storm was so severe--so bitterly cold, with blinding snow and
wind--that I thought no one could possibly get out with safety to
come that day; when, to my surprise, there was a knock at the door,
and there was Maza--faithful Maza--smiling as usual, through the
frost and snow.

Glad, as well as surprised, I was to see him. "They told me not to
come," he said. "They said I would get lost or freeze to death;
but," he added, "I told them I was coming." So the big drift was
tunneled to the stable door, horses fed and watered, and all needed
help given.

By these little homely incidents I have only tried to introduce a
few of the many friends on the Reservation, of whom it is sometimes
asked, "Can Indians ever be really civilized?" "Do you see any real
results?" "Do you find them very treacherous?"

CHRISTIAN ENDEAVORERS OF A HIGHLAND SCHOOL AND VILLAGE.


[Illustration: CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH, WILLIAMSBURG, KY.]

Miss Ella M. Andrews, one of the teachers at Williamsburg Academy,
which is one of the interesting schools among our American
Highlanders, has been an efficient leader in the Christian Endeavor
movement in that school and village. She writes under recent date of
the Senior Endeavor Society, as follows:

"The Y. P. S. C. E. of Main Street Congregational Church of
Williamsburg, Ky., was organized in 1887 with about a dozen charter
members. From this beginning has grown our present flourishing
society of about fifty members, many of whom are our students. The
good it has done these young people cannot be estimated. Many of the
students organize C. E. societies in their home towns and in the
places where they teach. The Tri-State Union was organized in 1893.
The organization was made for the purpose of promoting the C. E.
work in the adjacent counties of Kentucky, Virginia and Tennessee.
By bringing together the members of the societies in this section,
much has been accomplished in the way of strengthening the weak
societies and in the way of organizing and sustaining societies in
places where none existed. All societies in the Union have been
stimulated by its annual conventions."

The Junior Endeavorers in this field are under the especial care of
Miss M. A. Packard, also a teacher in this academy. Under her wise
supervision the Juniors have done much interesting and valuable
work. She writes as follows:

"The Junior Endeavor Society, a company of 76 bright, happy boys and
girls, representing two departments (the active members and the
trial members), is under the direction of the superintendent and two
assistants. The meetings are held every Sunday afternoon, led by one
of the members. We use the 'Junior Endeavor Songs,' and the Juniors'
voices are tuned to sing praise to Him who took little children in
His arms and blessed them. It is an inspiration to attend the
meetings, to hear the recital of the Pledge, the reading of the
Scripture verses and the precious season of prayer, when, with bowed
head, sentence prayers are offered, often two and three at a time.
During the past year the growth of the society has been marked, in
the Juniors learning to pray--God seems so near. Many precious
petitions have been made for self and others.

[Illustration: A MOUNTAIN HOME.]

"The Juniors are enthusiastic in bringing in their pennies, many
earning them. They purchase all their literature. Last April they
were very happy to donate to the church the sum of $12.34, the
result of an entertainment given by them ('The Junior Endeavor
Garden').

"This year we have taken up the prison work; sending the pennies to
purchase Testaments, and writing letters to the prisoners. Services
are held at the jail, and at the homes of the aged and sick, the
Juniors taking an active part.

"Thanksgiving Day, nineteen homes were gladdened by baskets of
eatables, carried by the Juniors, and other gifts. At Christmas many
hearts are made happy by their kind remembrances. During the last
three years twelve have graduated. All are active members in senior
societies. The trial department is under the direction of the
assistants, who are graduates. The society is most promising. The
Juniors are preparing not only to take places in the senior society,
but in the church and as citizens."

MRS. MARY T. CHASE.


Mrs. Mary Tuttle Chase, wife of Prof. T. N. Chase, of Atlanta
University, Atlanta, Georgia, died in the home of her daughter, Mrs.
Dr. Kirkland, Bellows Falls, Vermont, Friday, March 23d. Funeral
services were held in the church in which she worshiped in her
childhood in Acton, Mass. The president of the University, together
with the pastors of this church conducted the service. Some
graduates of Atlanta University sang some of the pathetic old negro
hymns. Mrs. Chase came of heroic New England stock. She was
graduated at Abbott Academy, Andover, Mass., and at once entered
upon the work of teaching. She was married to Prof. Chase in 1862.
Two years later they went to Washington, D. C. In 1869, with her
husband, she went to Atlanta, Georgia, and entered upon the great
work of her life in Atlanta University.

Mrs. Chase was a ready and able writer, and frequently contributed
articles to the AMERICAN MISSIONARY magazine. Her heart was quick in
its sympathies for those who were depressed and needy, and the
heroic courage of her ancestors ran in her veins. She was always
ready to defend the weak. She loved the work, and sought earnestly
the interests of the people to whom she gave the larger service of
her life. Her loss will be sorely felt in the ranks of faithful
Christian workers, of whom she was one. A large circle of friends
sympathize with Prof. Chase and the family in this hour of their
bereavement.

MISS SUSIE T. CATHCART.


Word has just come as we go to press that Miss Susie T. Cathcart
passed away at King's Mountain, N. C., on Monday morning, April 9th.
Miss Cathcart has been a teacher at Lincoln Academy, of which her
sister is principal, for several years. At the beginning of this
year her health was so delicate that she did not feel that she could
accept reappointment. She still hoped to be strong again, however,
and looked forward to future service among the people whom she so
sincerely loved. Her work has been always distinguished by ability
and great personal sacrifice, and almost an abandon of devotion to
those to whom she ministered. Even in her sickness she did not for a
moment forget them. Her sister, Miss Lillian Cathcart, Principal of
Lincoln Academy, writes of her as follows: "In her sickness she has
been very patient, never other than cheerful, and always trying to
spare others any unnecessary work. She has been able to take an
interest in what was going on almost all the time, and to send out
messages and to pray for the scholars." And so another earnest and
devoted life has gone out from earth, but its influence will
continue and cannot be measured by the passing years.

A SUGGESTIVE SUBSCRIPTION.


THE AMERICAN MISSIONARY received a subscription the other day which
illustrates several things. The subscription read as follows: "Mr.
Frederick Raeder, Jurjev--Dorpat--Livonia, Russia." This illustrates
the wide circulation of a journal especially devoted to home
missions. Not a numerous foreign subscription list does it enjoy,
but at least one copy reaches this remote region. Another thing
illustrated is the close connection between the home and foreign
fields of missions. A few years ago the Indians and Alaskans were
counted in the foreign missionary field. Now the American Missionary
Association conducts work in these fields. Porto Rico has just come
into the responsibility of our home work. And so in the progress of
these great missionary movements the emphasis is increasingly upon
_missions_, and not upon any artificial distinctions. It is the
coming of the Kingdom of God which the providences make important.

If any reader of the AMERICAN MISSIONARY has a copy of the Annual
Report of the American Missionary Association for 1849, he will
confer a favor by dropping a note to the editor of this magazine.
This volume is desired for one of our theological libraries.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
