BY JAMES C. PILLING.


Mr. Henry R. Schoolcraft, while engaged in the preparation of his
work--"Information respecting the History, Condition, and Prospects of
the Indian Tribes of the United States"--sent to various persons
residing among the Indians a "Comparative Vocabulary of the Languages of
the Indian Tribes of the United States," a quarto paper of 25 pages,
comprising 350 words, and the numerals one to one billion. The returns
from this were for the most part incorporated in his work; a few,
however, found their way into the collection of the Smithsonian
Institution.

In 1853-'54, Mr. George Gibbs, while engaged under Gov. Isaac I. Stevens
in "Explorations for a route for the Pacific Railroad near the 47th and
49th parallels of north latitude," became interested in the study of the
languages of the Indians inhabiting the Northwest, and collected many
vocabularies. To further extend this work, he prepared and had printed a
folio paper of three leaves entitled "A vocabulary of 180 words which it
is desired to collect in the different languages and dialects throughout
the Pacific Coast for publication by the Smithsonian Institute at
Washington."

These were sent to such persons as, in his judgment, were competent to
furnish the material desired, and many of them, filled or partly filled,
were returned to him. A second edition of this vocabulary, 6 ll., folio,
was issued.

In 1863 there was published by the Smithsonian Institution a pamphlet
with the following title:

Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections. | --160-- | Instructions | for
     research relative to the | Ethnology and Philology | of | America. |
     Prepared for the Smithsonian Institution. | By | George Gibbs. |
     Washington: | Smithsonian Institution: | March, 1863.

2 p. ll., pp. 1-51. 8^o.

In his introductory remarks, Professor Henry thus states the object of
the paper:

"The Smithsonian Institution is desirous of extending and completing its
collections of facts and materials relative to the Ethnology,
Archaeology, and Philology of the races of mankind inhabiting, either now
or at any previous period, the continent of America, and earnestly
solicits the cooeperation in this object of all officers of the United
States Government, and travellers or residents who may have it in their
power to render any assistance."

Under the head of Philology, Mr. Gibbs gave a brief account of some of
the peculiarities of Indian languages, with general directions for the
best method of collecting certain words; a simple and practical
alphabet; and a vocabulary in English, Spanish, French, and Latin of 211
words. Speaking of the latter, he says:

"In view of the importance of a uniform system in collecting words of
the various Indian languages of North America, adapted to the use of
officers of the government, travellers, and others, the following is
recommended as a STANDARD VOCABULARY. It is mainly the one prepared by
the late Hon. Albert Gallatin, with a few changes made by Mr. Hale, the
Ethnologist of the United States Exploring Expedition, and is adopted as
that upon which nearly all the collections hitherto made for the purpose
of comparison have been based. For the purpose of ascertaining the more
obvious relations between the various members of existing families this
number is deemed sufficient. The remote affinities must be sought in a
wider research, demanding a degree of acquaintance with their languages
beyond the reach of transient visitors."

The vocabulary given in this paper was separately printed on writing
paper, 10 ll., 4^o, and reprinted, 6 ll., folio, and was distributed
widely among the missionaries, Indian agents, travelers, and local
collectors in ethnology, and has served a valuable purpose, resulting in
the collection by the Smithsonian Institution of a large number of
vocabularies, comprising many of the languages and dialects of the
Indian tribes of the United States, British America, and Mexico.

This material, as it was received, was placed in the hands of Mr. Gibbs
for revision and classification--a work in which he was engaged at the
time of his death, which occurred before any of it was published.

In 1876, Professor Henry turned this material over to Maj. J.W. Powell,
then in charge of the United States Geographical and Geological Survey
of the Rocky Mountain Region, to be consolidated and published in
connection with like material collected by himself and his assistants
while among the Indians of the western portion of the United States. A
number were accordingly published in the "Contributions to North
American Ethnology," Vols. I and III, a quarto series issued by the
Survey.

Wishing to extend the work already begun by the Smithsonian Institution,
Major Powell, in 1877, prepared the following paper:

Introduction | to the | Study of Indian Languages, | with words, phrases,
     and sentences to be collected. | By J.W. Powell. | Washington: |
     Government Printing Office. | 1877.

Pp. 1-104, 10 ruled ll., 4^o.

In his opening remarks, referring to the manuscripts derived from the
distribution of Mr. Gibbs' paper, the author says: "It has, in fact,
greatly stimulated investigation, giving wiser direction to inquiry,
and the results have abundantly proved the value of the 'Instructions'
and the wisdom of its publication; and it serves to mark an epoch in the
history of ethnographic investigation in America. The material which has
thus been accumulated is of great amount, and its study has led to such
important conclusions that it is deemed wise to prepare a new system of
instruction, more comprehensive in plan and more elaborate in detail.
First, it is found necessary to enlarge the alphabet so as to include a
greater number of sounds, which have been discovered in the North
American languages, and to mark other letters with greater precision.
Second, it is necessary to enlarge the vocabulary so as to modify it
somewhat, as experience has dictated, so that new words may be
collected. Third, it is desirable that many simple phrases and sentences
should be given--so chosen as to bring out the more important
characteristics of grammatic structure."

In the preparation of this paper, the alphabet was considered to be of
prime importance. Concerning it, the author says: "After devoting much
time to the consideration of the subject, and the examination of many
alphabets devised by scholars and linguists, none was found against
which there was not serious objections, and the author attempted to
devise an alphabet which would contain all the supposed requirements;
but there were many difficulties in the way, and many compromises to be
made in weighing the various considerations. At this stage of the work
he applied to the eminent philologist, Prof. W.D. Whitney, for
assistance. After much consultation and the weighing of the many
considerations arising from the large amount of manuscript material in
the author's hands, Professor Whitney kindly prepared the following
paper on the alphabet."

The words, phrases, and sentences to be collected are arranged in
schedules, each preceded by instructions, and followed by blanks for

This paper was prepared with special reference to the wants of the
collector, being printed on bond paper and bound in flexible cloth. It
was widely distributed and, like that of Mr. Gibbs, resulted in the
collection of valuable linguistic material.

In 1879 Congress consolidated the various surveys, including that of the
Rocky Mountain Region, into the United States Geological Survey, but
made provision for continuing the publication of the Contributions to
North American Ethnology under the direction of the Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution, and directed that the ethnologic material in
Major Powell's hands be turned over to the Institution. Thus the Bureau
of Ethnology of the Smithsonian Institution was organized, and Major
Powell was placed at its head.

By this time the growing interest manifested in the study of North
American linguistics rendered necessary the preparation of a new edition
of the Introduction. In the words of the author:

"The progress made by various students, and the studies made by the
author, alike require that a new edition be prepared to meet the more
advanced wants and to embody the results of wider studies. Under these
circumstances the present edition is published. It does not purport to
be a philosophic treatment of the subject of language; it is not a
comparative grammar of Indian tongues; it is simply a series of
explanations of certain characteristics almost universally found by
students of Indian languages--the explanations being of such a
character as experience has shown would best meet the wants of persons
practically at work in the field on languages with which they are
unfamiliar. The book is a body of directions for collectors.

"It is believed that the system of schedules, followed _seriatim_, will
lead the student in a proper way to the collection of linguistic
materials; that the explanations given will assist him in overcoming the
difficulties which he is sure to encounter; and that the materials when
collected will constitute valuable contributions to philology. It has
been the effort of the author to connect the study of language with the
study of other branches of anthropology, for a language is best
understood when the habits, customs, institutions, philosophy--the
subject-matter of thought embodied in the language--are best known. The
student of language should be a student of the people who speak the
language; and to this end the book has been prepared, with many hints
and suggestions relating to other branches of anthropology."

Experience had demonstrated the propriety of some changes in the
alphabet and a considerable enlargement of the scheme as given in the
first edition of the work, and in the second Major Powell has made many
modifications. The schedule of relationship was so large that graphic
representation was considered necessary, and charts were prepared which
it was thought both the student and the Indian could follow it with
comparative ease. Experience has shown that the idea was well founded.

As in the first edition, blank spaces were given after each schedule for
such additions as might suggest themselves to the collector; and to
further facilitate the work separate alphabet cards of convenient size
accompanied the volume.

This publication has not been long enough in the hands of collectors to
meet with great returns, though a sufficient number have been received,
filled or partly filled, to justify the Bureau in anticipating, in the
not distant future, the receipt of a body of material prepared according
to scientific methods which, when published, will prove a valuable
contribution to this branch of ethnologic research.

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
