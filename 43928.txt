PREFACE.


In Professor Sars' "Crustacea of Norway," quite a number of the British
species of woodlice are figured in detail and described in English, but
few copies of this fine work are to be met with in our country. The
Rev. Canon Norman has from time to time published notes on the British
species in "The Annals and Magazine of Natural History;" these are,
however, scattered, and contain but few figures, while other literature
that exists is out of date. Under these circumstances, we have thought
that the following account and figures of all the British species would
be useful to those anxious to work at the woodlice, and might also
encourage others to pay attention to the distribution and habits of the
interesting tribe to which they belong.

The writers would welcome any corrections or additions in view of a
second edition.

THE BRITISH WOODLICE.


=Introduction.=--Having finished a somewhat exhaustive list of the land
and fresh-water molluscs of Essex,[1] one of the present writers felt
that if he were to make any further contributions of importance to a
knowledge of the fauna of that interesting county, he must turn his
attention to some other group of animals. It seemed most fitting that
some creatures should be chosen which are commonly met with during the
search for molluscs. Centipedes, millepedes, and woodlice fulfilled
these conditions, and all were collected, but as only seventeen
species of woodlice had at the time been found in England, it was
deemed advisable to study these in detail to begin with. The present
contribution is the result of the undertaking, and we have thought that
a general consideration of the British Woodlice, with careful drawings
from nature of all the species now known from this country, ought to
lead to a more general study of these interesting creatures and their
habits.

=Position in the scheme of classification.=--The Woodlice belong to
an immense group of invertebrate animals known as the Arthropoda, the
bodies of which are segmented and provided with jointed appendages for
purposes of walking, swimming, and feeding. Of this group, two large
divisions are recognized. The first contains the forms which breathe
by means of air-tubes, such as the Insects; and the second has been
constituted for Crustacea, which breathe by means of gills. The latter
are, of course, adapted more especially for a life in water, but here
and there we come across examples so modified that they can exist in
air. The land-crabs are a case in point, and so are the Woodlice. These
belong to an order which contains many fresh-water and marine species,
known as the Isopoda.

=Geological history.=--The known history of the order is a long one,
for remains occur in the Old Red Sandstone (Devonian) of Herefordshire,
and in the Coal Measures. (79)[2]. A form which has been named
_Archaeoniscus brodiei_, and is said to be referable to the recent
family Aegidae which is found in some numbers in the Purbeck Beds
(Upper Jurassic), of this country (47). Fossil Isopods have also been
recorded from the Oolite and from the Oligocene (Isle of Wight).

Turning to the Woodlice proper, we find that they first make their
appearance in the Miocene (of Oenigen and Baden), and occur also
in amber (79); while examples of genera, such as _Oniscus_ and
_Porcellio_, have been discovered in late Tertiary deposits (47).

=External structure and appendages.=--Woodlice agree in being of a
somewhat oval form, and their bodies are arched, the curve varying in
different genera and species. A _head_ is to be distinguished; behind
this comes the _thorax_ of seven segments which are often considerably
broader than the six succeeding ones which form the _abdomen_ (see fig.
1.)

[Illustration: FIG. 1.--PARTS OF THE BODY. (_Oniscus asellus._)]

The head carries two _large antennae_ (fig. 3) which are very evident,
and a careful search with a lens will reveal a second and minute pair
(the _smaller antennae_) situated between the base of the others, and
really anterior to them. (figs. 2 and 4.)

[Illustration: FIG. 2.--THE FIRST ANTENNA. (_Oniscus asellus._)]

The larger antennae are customarily bent at certain points, and we can
distinguish a terminal part, or _flagellum_, and a basal part, the
_peduncle_ (fig. 3). The number of joints in these structures, which
varies in different genera and species, forms a useful classificatory
character, and the relative length of the component parts is of
considerable value in distinguishing species.

[Illustration: FIG. 3.--THE SECOND ANTENNA. (_Oniscus asellus._)]

There are four pairs of mouth appendages--namely the jaws or
_mandibles_ (fig. 5), the _first maxillae_ (fig. 6), the _second
maxilla_ (fig. 7), and the _maxillipeds_ (fig. 8). When the head is
examined from the underside the last of these organs will be seen
first, covering in the others.

[Illustration: FIG. 4.--THE UNDERSIDE OF THE HEAD. (_Oniscus
asellus._)]

A small median plate attached to the front of the head has been called
"_the upper lip_" (fig. 9), while inside the mouth appendages is a
little bilobed structure "_the lower lip_" (fig. 10).

[Illustration: FIG. 5.--THE MANDIBLES. (_Oniscus asellus._)]

Before leaving the external features of the head, we must allude to
the pair of _eyes_ which are usually present, though never raised on
stalks. In the Common Woodlouse (_Oniscus asellus_, from which all
our figures to illustrate structure have been made), as in many other
species, the eyes are compound (fig. 4), but in some forms these are
simple.

[Illustration: FIG. 6.--THE FIRST MAXILLAE. (_Oniscus asellus._)]

[Illustration: FIG. 7.--THE SECOND MAXILLAE. (_Oniscus asellus._)]

[Illustration: FIG. 8.--THE FUSED MAXILLIPEDS. (_Oniscus asellus._)]

Each of the seven joints of the thorax bears a pair of _walking legs_
(fig. 11), and in the female at the time when the eggs are laid, a pair
of plates (fig. 12) arises on segments II. to V. These plates together
form a brood pouch, in which the eggs are carried (fig. 12) until
they are hatched, and in which the young ones remain for some time
afterwards.

When we examine the abdomen, we find that the appendages are
plate-like, with the exception of the last pair (fig. 13), and they all
agree in having two divisions, an arrangement which would prove awkward
in limbs used for walking or feeling.

[Illustration: FIG. 9.--THE "UPPER LIP." (_Oniscus asellus._)]

[Illustration: FIG. 10.--THE "LOWER LIP." (_Oniscus asellus._)]

[Illustration: FIG. 11.--A TYPICAL THORACIC SEGMENT. (_Oniscus
asellus._)]

[Illustration: FIG. 12.--THE FIFTH THORACIC SEGMENT OF A FEMALE.
(_Oniscus asellus._)]

The inner plate (or endopodite) is in structure a _gill_, but the blood
that passes through it, is enabled to take up oxygen from moist air,
while the outer division (or exopodite) acts as a protecting cover
(fig. 14). In _Porcellio_, air-tubes (_tracheae_) may be present (see
below).

[Illustration: FIG. 13.--THE UNDERSIDE OF THE ABDOMEN OF A FEMALE.
(_Oniscus asellus._)]

In the male, the first two pairs of abdominal appendages are specially
modified, the inner divisions (endopodites) being long and pointed
(figs. 15 and 16). The last pair, or tail appendages, in the male are
often considerably larger than in the female, and the form of these
structures is sometimes of value in classification.

[Illustration: FIG. 16.--THE SECOND ABDOMINAL APPENDAGE OF THE MALE.
(_Oniscus asellus._)]

=Alimentary canal.=--The main portion of the alimentary system is,
practically speaking, a straight tube (fig. 17). Its first part (not
shown in the figure) is a narrow gullet, which after passing through
the nerve collar dilates to form a sort of stomach. Into this the
secretion of four digestive glands is poured by two ducts. These glands
have a somewhat striking appearance, being yellow tubes spirally
coiled, and they end blindly. From the stomach the intestine runs to
the hinder end of the body and passes under the heart.

=Circulatory system.=--The blood being aerated in the abdominal
appendages, we find that the heart is situated towards the hinder end
of the body (fig. 18). Three main arteries supply the thorax and head,
while the blood is brought from the gills to the heart.

=Excretory system.=--The excretory organs consist of a (_a_) pair of
so-called "shell glands," which are considered to be the equivalents
of the excretory tubes or nephridia of annelid worms. In the woodlouse
these excretory organs open on the second pair of maxillae. They are
composed of a tube (_sacculus_) closed at one end and more or less bent
upon itself (5, p. 261) which communicates with a _labyrinth_ that
is provided with an excretory orifice. Matters are eliminated by the
_epithelial cells_ [the histology has been described and figured in
_Ligidium hypnorum_ (66)], which are very large in _Ligia oceanica_.

[Illustration: Fig. 17.--THE ALIMENTARY CANAL. (_Oniscus asellus._)]

[Illustration: Fig. 18.--THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM. (_Oniscus asellus._)]

(_b_) Masses of cellules in the head, very greatly developed in _Ligia
oceanica_ (but numbering scarcely more than ten in _Oniscus asellus_),
which have no external opening. They also function as excretory organs
(5, p. 263), and have been called "cephalic nephrocytes."

[Illustration: FIG. 19.--THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. (_Oniscus asellus._)]

(_c_) Other "branchial nephrocytes" are situated on the dorsal surface
between the last thoracic and the first abdominal segments, as well as
between those that follow, with the exception of the last two; they are
in distinct patches, one on each of the middle line in _Ligia_, but
more or less continuous in _Oniscus_ (5, p. 265).

(_d_) The digestive glands have also been shown to be excretory (5, p.
270).

=Nervous system.=--The nervous system consists of _paired ganglia_
in the head, above the alimentary canal which send off nerves
(_commissures_) that meet below, to form a _double nerve cord_ with
ganglia at intervals (see fig. 19).

[Illustration: FIG. 20.--FEMALE REPRODUCTORY ORGANS. (_Oniscus
asellus._)]

=Reproductive organs.=--In the female there are a pair of _ovaries_ in
the positions shewn in fig. 20; and _ducts_ run to the underside of the
fifth thoracic segment.

The openings are very difficult to identify, and Lereboullet (39, p.
113) was unable to find them. It is obvious that the openings must be
underneath the plates that form the egg pouch, and as a change of skin
is required to set these free, it would appear that at ordinary seasons
the ducts from the ovaries are closed. The writers have been able to
determine from external examination of specimens which had moulted and
were about to lay eggs, that the oviducts at such time open to the
inside of the base of each walking leg on the fifth segment. In similar
specimens the oviducts were also followed to the opening from within.
The _brood pouch_ has already been described.

The male organs consist of six _testes_ arranged in two pairs, each
of which is provided with a _reservoir_ (see fig. 21). The efferent
ducts from the two reservoirs unite at the base of the thorax to form a
common duct (or "penis").

[Illustration: FIG. 21.--THE MALE REPRODUCTORY ORGANS. (_Oniscus
asellus._)]

=Development.=--The eggs, in the common species of woodlice, at
least, are laid at the beginning of summer, and are retained in the
brood pouch, where they undergo their development. The process has
been recently traced with great care by Professor Louis Roule (58) in
_Porcellio scaber_ and the description which follows is based upon his
researches.

As, practically speaking, the larval stages are passed within the egg,
and there is no free embryo differing in form from the parent, it is
necessary for the young creatures to be well supplied with nutritive
material. In fact, the bulk of the large egg is made up of _food-yolk_,
on the outside of which the _formative protoplasm_ is disposed in
irregular patches. In the fertilized ovum, one of the latter, which
lies in a particular position at the end, is found to be larger than
the others (see fig. 22). It contains the nucleus of the egg-cell (see
fig. 23) and is called the _cicatricula_. This is the only portion of
the egg which divides and produces _nucleated cells_. It is these which
gradually spread all over the surface of the food-yolk, forming a layer
known as the _blastoderm_, which is at first but one cell thick (see
figs. 24, 26, and 28).

Before, however, the food-yolk is quite closed in, a differentiation
into two layers--the _pro-ectoderm_ and _pro-endoderm_--takes place
(see fig. 25) and rudiments of the first two pairs of _appendages_
appear (see fig. 26). Moreover, the cells of the ectoderm change their
shape and begin to multiply at two points to form the beginnings of the
cerebral ganglia and the nerve cord respectively.

[Illustration: FIG. 22.--THE FERTILIZED EGG (_Porcellio scaber_), AFTER
ROULE.]

[Illustration: FIG. 23.--THE FERTILIZED EGG SEEN IN SECTION (_Porcellio
scaber_), AFTER ROULE.]

As the blastoderm closes over the food-yolk, two more appendages arise
and these are soon followed by others (see fig. 28). A depression
appears at the point where the blastoderm closed and internally the
pro-endoderm or inner layer is differentiated into two--the _endoderm
proper_ and the _mesoderm_ (see fig. 29). The former begins to grow
so that its edges unite to form the middle part of the intestine (see
fig. 29) seen from the outside in fig. 30. The depression already
mentioned grows deeper, forming a tube which is the hind portion of the
_intestine_, while at the anterior end of the embryo the front part of
the intestine is similarly formed (see fig. 30). By this time also all
the nineteen appendages have made their appearance and the mesoderm,
(which has grown considerably, to form the beginnings of the muscles)
has sent prolongations into each of them. About this time, spaces (see
fig. 31) are formed in the muscular mesoderm which are all that remain
of the _true body cavity_ characteristic of animals above the level of
the jelly fish, and in these spaces the blood ultimately circulates.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF A WOODLOUSE (_Porcellio scaber_), AFTER ROULE.

Figs. 24, 26, 28, 30, are Surface Views, and figs. 25, 27, 29, 31,
which indicate slightly later stages respectively than the others, are
of egg seen in Optical Section.

The body next alters somewhat in shape and the three divisions of
the intestine approach one another (see fig. 32) previous to their
junction. As may be imagined during these processes the food-yolk has
gradually been used up and the space which it occupied taken by the
internal organs, which we have mentioned.

[Illustration: FIG. 32.--EMBRYO OF THE WOODLOUSE SHOWING THE THREE
DIVISIONS OF THE INTESTINE SEPARATELY DEVELOPED (_Porcellio scaber_),

[Illustration: FIG. 33.--EMBRYO OF THE WOODLOUSE SHOWING TRACES OF THE
SEGMENTS (_Porcellio scaber_), AFTER ROULE.]

[Illustration: FIG. 34.--AN EMBRYO WOODLOUSE READY TO BE HATCHED
(_Porcellio scaber_), AFTER ROULE.]

In the last stages of the development the appendages become larger
still, the _heart_ makes its appearance, segmentation of the body is
completed, and except that the seventh pair of walking legs are as yet
rudimentary the woodlouse is completed. It is only after hatching that
the pair of legs mentioned, attain to their normal length.

The process of segmentation of the egg and the formation of its layers
lasts about a fortnight, while the completion of the development
proceeds much more rapidly, for another three weeks bring it to an end.

After the first moult or change of skin the last pair of walking
legs makes its appearance, and Mr. James B. Casserley [whose work
one of us (75) has described elsewhere] found when keeping a number
of the common pill-woodlouse (_Armadillidium vulgare_) in captivity
that his specimens did not subsequently change their skins more than
once in the six months during which he had them under observation. He
also noted that the crustaceans go on growing after they are sexually
mature. As his specimens grew older, Mr. Casserley noticed that their
colour became darker, and a curious point recorded by him is that two
examples of the same age may change their skins at the same time,
and while one may have afterwards nearly twice as many markings, on
the other very few at all will be seen. The time required for the
growth of a woodlouse from the size of a pin's head to that of an
adult example--say three-quarters-of-an-inch long--must be fairly
considerable, taking into account the fact that any appreciable
increase in size can only occur at a moult and Mr. Casserley's
observations as to the infrequency of the process in _Armadillidium
vulgare_. (See p. 14.)

=Habits and Economic Considerations.=--The construction of the
breathing organs of woodlice, and the necessity which exists for these
to be kept moist, restricts the habitats of the animals considerably.
Woodlice are found under stones and logs, beneath the bark of dead and
rotten trees, among decaying vegetable matter as well as living grass
and moss in damp or wet situations. When looking for some of the common
species under the bark of fallen trees it is surprising to notice that
the crustaceans may be entirely absent from many trunks, while when
another is examined which seems to differ very slightly, if at all, in
condition or situation, they are found in swarms. There is no doubt
but that the habits of woodlice would well repay the attention of
naturalists, who are now recognizing that besides anatomy as such, and
the classification which a knowledge of structure permits, there is the
equally important consideration of the creatures as they live their own
life and affect that of others. It is not our object to give a detailed
account of the ecology of British woodlice, but rather to provide a
basis from which it may be approached. Nevertheless a few general
remarks may not come amiss. Many points in the life-history of woodlice
may no doubt be learned by keeping them in captivity and there is just
sufficient difficulty in doing this successfully to give an interest to
the matter.

Apart from a supply of proper food, we take it that the chief object to
be attained is the provision of the amount of moisture required by the
particular species under examination, together with a sufficient supply
of air.

A great many interesting observations can be thus carried out, such
as those of Mr. Casserley, to which allusion has already been made.
The process of moulting for instance is well worth watching, and
although specimens with half their coat changed may be found in remote
corners, yet the whole course of the moult can be seen much better
in the case of captive woodlice. The following account is taken from
Mr. Casserley's description (75) of what happens in the case of
_Armadillidium vulgare_:--The approach of the moult is indicated by
the appearance of a white border on each segment of the body, which
becomes gradually more marked, while at the same time the animal is
seen to be less active and often makes a small burrow in which to
hide. Sometimes a sheltered corner against a stone is looked upon as
affording sufficient protection, but in either case each woodlouse
keeps to the place originally chosen. About ten days after the white
lines have become visible the animal appears to be divided into two.
Its skin is becoming loose and little movement can take place at the
joints of its body with the exception of that between the fourth and
fifth thoracic segments where the skin will ultimately break. The
woodlouse spends a day or two in this condition and then, by suddenly
walking forward, frees itself from the covering of the hinder portion
of its body. The three last pairs of walking legs are carefully pulled
out from the old skin, which now appears perfectly white, and at the
same time the lining of the hind portion of the alimentary canal (hind
gut) is also shed. After putting the tender half of his body well into
his corner or burrow the woodlouse proceeds to eat the part of his skin
that he has cast. The creature has now a very odd appearance. His front
half with the exception of the white edges is as it was before, the
rest of him instead of a light slaty blue, and is very soft as well as
proportionately a little larger.

In three days or so the tail end becomes hard and attains the normal
colour. Then the old skin from the front half is pushed off and the
creature becomes practically defenceless, so much so in fact, that any
of his species that happen to find him will attack him and eat all his
front half, rejecting, however, his now hardened tail-end.

Provided that the moulting woodlouse has survived (and in captivity, to
ensure this, he must be isolated), after three days his jaws will be
sufficiently hardened to allow of his eating, and usually he first of
all devours the second half of his cast skin. The operation of moulting
does not occupy quite so long a time in the case of young examples.
Specimens half-an-inch long do not moult more than once in six months
and show but little increase in size after the process.

Woodlice do not appear to live on either animal or vegetable food
alone, but adopt a mixed diet. It is, however, owing to their attacks
upon cultivated plants that the creatures are looked upon as pests by
the horticulturalist. The animals feed either in the night or in the
very early morning, on seedlings, orchid tubers, mushrooms, or anything
that comes to hand. Few of the accounts, however, of their ravages,
mention that the crustaceans have been caught absolutely in the act
of doing the damage ascribed to them. Some careful inquiries have
nevertheless enabled us to discover several observers who have watched
woodlice feeding. Mr. F. V. Theobald, of Wye College, and one of the
students at Swanley Horticultural College are among the number. The
former has also given us an account of the methods, out of many tried,
which he has found most successful for getting rid of the crustaceans.
Out of doors trapping with moss, sacking or horse-dung is best. In
glass houses, fumigation with hydro-cyanic acid gas has cleared them
out, and poison baits, especially potatoes cut and soaked in white
arsenic, have done some good. Stable manure is especially favourable to
these creatures, particularly when it is used "long": in this condition
it should therefore be avoided.

It is interesting to note how the woodlice in winter simply remain
where they happen to be so long as there is sufficient moisture, though
they are ready to run about as rapidly, for a time, as in summer,
should they happen to be disturbed.

No doubt many points of inter-relation between woodlice and other
animals remain to be discovered. Mr. John W. Odell tells us that on
Exmoor, in the open, he found no _Armadillidia_, though other forms
occurred under nine out of every ten stones that he turned over, and
here the smaller species of ants also abounded. Close to stone walls
_Armadillidia_ were to be seen to the exclusion of all other genera,
and this state of affairs was ascribed by Mr. Odell to the presence of
swarms of the large wood-ants which he considers would make short work
of any woodlice that could not protect themselves by rolling up.

We ought not to conclude this account without mentioning the fact that
woodlice once played an important part in medicine.

Doctor Fernie (28) gives some interesting extracts with regard to the
hog-louse and the woodlouse. The latter he seems to have identified
quite correctly as _Oniscus asellus_. He calls the former, however,
indiscriminately, "the common armadillo" (which is the old name for
the pill-woodlice now known as _Armadillidium_), "the pill millipede"
and "_Glomeris marginata_." The last two names are those of another
creature, not a crustacean, which when it is rolled up can be very
easily mistaken for an _Armadillidium_, though, when it uncurls, it
will be seen to have many more than seven pairs of legs. The local
appellations applied to the hog-louse by Doctor Fernie, and his remarks
with regard to its commonness, tend to show that it is _Armadillidium
vulgare_, to which he really refers, and the use of which in medicine
was commonly general.

Hog-lice were prescribed for scrofulous diseases and obstructions of
the liver and digestive organs, among other things, and the London
College of Physicians directed that the creatures should be prepared
by suspending them in a thin canvas bag placed within a covered vessel
over the steam of hot spirit or wine, so that being killed by the
spirit they might become friable. Hog-lice and Woodlice were also
administered alive, while the former were also put down the throats of
cows "to promote the restoration" of their cud, hence their name of
"cud-worm." There seems to be considerable evidence that even in modern
times Woodlice have had considerable remedial effect which depends upon
"an alkalescent fluid" contained in them.

=Local Names.=--Among the local names by which these creatures are
known are those of "sow bug," "lucre pig" (Berkshire), "carpenter"
and "chiselhog" (Berkshire). Doctor Fernie (28) gives a number of
others:--"thrush-louse," "tiggyhog," "cheslip," "kitchenball,"
"chiselbob," "lugdor," "palmer," and "cudworm." In the eastern
counties the same writer notes that they are known as "old-sows" or
"St. Anthony's hogs" while the Welsh call them "little grey-hogs," "the
little old women of the wood" or "grammar-sows," grammar signifying
a shrivelled up old dame. _Oniscus asellus_ was sometimes called
"socchetre," "church louse," and "chinch."

=Methods of Collection and Preservation.=--Woodlice should be collected
straightway into tubes or bottles half filled with 30 per cent.
methylated spirit.[3] Woodlice dropped into this weak spirit become
gradually narcotised and die, and they remain limp enough for purposes
of examination or to allow, of their legs and antennae being set out
during the process of mounting. Specimens to be kept permanently should
be placed in 70 per cent. alcohol. For storage purposes the specimens
of each species from a given locality should be put together into a
small flat bottomed tube such as is used for pillules by apothecaries
or specially made for natural history purposes. A paper label on
which the name, locality, date of capture and any other necessary
particulars have been written with dark lead pencil, is not affected by
the spirit. The tubes may be corked, though if not frequently examined
all the spirit may evaporate, and cause the specimens to be spoilt. A
safer method is to plug the tubes with cotton wool and keep all those
containing a given species or specimens from a particular locality
beneath the surface of spirit in a large wide-mouthed bottle, into
which first of all some cotton wool has been put to prevent the tubes
from coming into sudden contact with the glass at the bottom. For show
purposes in museums, specimens taken direct from 30 per cent. spirit
should be mounted on slips of opal glass by means of gum-tragacanth
which has been powdered and shaken up in spirit before having water
added to it. The slips can be exhibited in glass tubes, six inches high
by one across, or in narrow stoppered museum jars. A variation of the
method is to mount the animals on clear glass and to place behind them
another strip of any colour that may be preferred.

=Classification.=--The various genera of woodlice are connected
together so closely, by intermediate forms, that their division into
families is, to a very great extent, arbitrary. Bate and Westwood
described but a single family Oniscidae (I), though they distinguished
two sub-families:--Ligiinae, which included the forms with many joints
to the flagellum of the antenna, and Oniscinae, which contained the rest.

Since then the pill-woodlice have been thought by some to be
sufficiently different from the other genera to warrant their
separation, and three families namely, Ligiidae, Oniscidae, and
Armadillidae have been recognized, as for instance by Dr. Scharff (63).

A fourth family--Trichoniscidae--has been added by Professor G. O. Sars,
who in his _Crustacea of Norway_ (59) alludes to the division of the
tribe into the sections Ligiae and Onisci and has adopted the following
classification:--

_Order_--=ISOPODA.=

_Tribe_--ONISCOIDA.

  _Family I._--LIGIIDAE.
             _Ligia._

              _Trichoniscus._
              _Trichoniscoides._
              _Haplophthalmus._

  _Family III._--ONISCIDAE.
               _Oniscus._
               _Philoscia._
               _Platyarthrus._

               _Metoponorthus._
               _Cylisticus._

  _Family IV._--ARMADILLIDIIAE.
              _Armadillidium._

All the genera described by Professor Sars are represented in the
British Islands.

                   rolled up into a ball             _Armadillidium._

=British Species.=--Naturalists in this country paid little attention
to the recognition or description of Woodlice, until the latter half of
the nineteenth century.

In 1857 Kinahan read a paper before the British Association (32) in
which he described fourteen species of woodlice from the British
Islands, and eleven years later when Bate and Westwood published
their book (1), the number had risen to seventeen. One of the species
(_Oniscus fossor_), however, was doubtful, and although Dr. Scharff
in 1894 (63) rejected it, his list contained also seventeen species,
for in the meantime the Rev. T. R. R. Stebbing had found _Ligidium
hypnorum_ in Surrey (70).

Since then the Rev. Canon Norman, Dr. Scharff, the Rev. T. R. R.
Stebbing, and one of the present writers, have added other species, as
will be seen from the following pages, in which all those found, up to
the present time in the British Islands are described and figured.

We shall now consider in detail the British genera and species of
woodlice and give their synonymy and distribution.

_Order_--=ISOPODA.=

_Tribe--ONISCOIDA._


_Section_--=LIGIAE.=

THE TWO DIVISIONS OF THE TAIL APPENDAGES ALIKE IN SHAPE.

_Family_--LIGIIDAE.

=Flagellum with ten or more joints; tail appendages wholly visible;
head without lateral lobes.=

_Genus_--=LIGIA= Fabricius, 1798 (27), p. 301.

_Abdomen broad; body large; habitat, the sea-shore._

The genus _Ligia_ agrees with _Ligidium_ alone, in that the flagellum
of the larger antennae has more than ten joints. In both genera, there
are no lateral lobes to the head, and the tail appendages are wholly
visible from the upper surface of the body. The latter in _Ligia_ is,
however, very many times bigger than in _Ligidium_ and shows no abrupt
decrease in the width of its segments when the abdomen is reached.

=Ligia oceanica= Linne (The Quay-louse). PLATE I.

  1767  _Oniscus oceanicus_ Linne (43), p. 1061.
  1793  _Cymothoa oceanica_ Fabricius (26), p. 509.
  1815  _Ligia scopulorum_ Leach (38), p. 374.
  1868  _Ligia oceanica_ Bate and Westwood (1), p. 444.
  1898  _Ligia oceanica_ Sars (59), 156, pl. LXX.

There is but one British species of _Ligia_, and this, the largest
member of the whole tribe to be met with in these Islands, usually
attains a length of two centimetres, while adult males may be nearly
half as long again. It is the _Oniscus oceanicus_ of Linnaeus and lives
on the sea shore, where it may be found at low tide beneath stones and
rubbish in the crevices of timber. _Ligia_ forms a connecting link
between the woodlice proper and the many Isopods which actually live in
the sea.

The colour of the animals is a greenish grey, and the compound eyes
are almost black, so that they are very conspicuous; there are from
eleven to fourteen joints to the flagellum of the outer antennae and
this feature, taken in conjunction with the large size and habitat, is
sufficient to identify the species in question.

On the coast of Essex the name "quay-lowders" is given to these
crustaceans, "lowder" being apparently an old plural of louse.

[Illustration: FIG. 35.--FLAGELLUM AND LAST PEDUNCULAR JOINT OF THE
ANTENNA OF _Ligia oceanica_.]

It is worthy of mention that Mr. Webb, when in charge of the Marine
Biological Station at Brightlingsea, examined a very large male
specimen of _Ligia oceanica_, in which the maxillae were duplicated and
consisted of four pairs instead of two.

_Genus_--=LIGIDIUM= Brandt, 1833 (3), p. 173. Zia, Koch (34).

_Abdomen narrow; habitat, wet moss._

In _Ligidium_ there are numerous joints to the flagellum, lateral
lobes are absent from the head, and the tail appendages are completely
to be seen. All the segments of the abdomen are distinctly narrower
than those of the thorax and in this it agrees with _Trichoniscus_,
_Trichoniscoides_, _Philoscia_, and _Metoponorthus_. In these, however,
the flagellum has never more than seven joints, the tail appendages (as
in all genera but _Ligia_ and _Ligidium_) are partially hidden by the
last segment, and in all the four but _Philoscia_ there are lobes to
the head.

  1898 _Ligidium hypnorum_ G. O. Sars (59), p. 158, pl. LXXI.

This species, which like the last, is the only British representative
of its genus, was added to our fauna in 1873 by the Rev. Thomas R. R.
Stebbing (70) who found specimens in the neighbourhood of Copthorne
Common, Surrey. Up to the present time, when we are pleased to announce
that we discovered it in the spring of 1902 at Warley in Essex,
_Ligidium hypnorum_ has not been recorded from any other place in the
British Islands.

[Illustration: FIG. 36.--FLAGELLUM AND LAST PEDUNCULAR JOINT OF THE
ANTENNA OF _Ligidium hypnorum_.]

As the name of the species implies, it lives in wet situations and in
its turn connects _Ligia_ with the forms which inhabit drier places.
_Ligidium hypnorum_ might be mistaken for _Philoscia muscorum_, but as
already pointed out in the generic description, the latter has but a
few (three) joints to the flagellum, instead of from ten to thirteen.
From _Ligia_, the species under consideration is distinguished by its
small size, narrow abdomen, and habitat.

_BRITISH LOCALITIES:--_

  _England_: Warley, Essex; (W.M.W.): Copthorne Common, Surrey;
     (Stebbing, 70).

_FOREIGN DISTRIBUTION:--_

  _Europe_: France; (25): Sweden; Denmark; Germany; (59): Turkey; (8).

_Family_--TRICHONISCIDAE.

=Flagellum with less than ten joints; head with lateral lobes; tail
appendages partly hidden.=

_Genus_--=TRICHONISCUS= Brandt, 1833 (3), p. 174.

_Abdomen narrow; eyes compound; flagellum, usually with more than three
joints._

In _Trichoniscus_ the flagellum may have from seven to four (rarely
three) joints. As in _Trichoniscoides_ and _Haplophthalmus_ there are
lateral lobes to the head, though these are not very pronounced; the
body is also of small size, the abdomen narrow with both divisions of
the tail appendages equally so, and almost of the same length though
slightly covered by the last segment. The compound eyes distinguish
_Trichoniscus_ from the two genera named, and from _Platyarthrus_,
while its small size and the character of its tail-parts mark it out
from all others.

  1868 _Philougria riparia_ Bate and Westwood (1), p. 456.
  1898 _Trichoniscus pusillus_ Sars (59), p. 161, pl. LXXII., fig. 1.

This tiny species is found commonly amongst the roots of the herbage in
very moist places. It presents a horny translucent appearance and is
of a reddish brown colour. It runs with considerable speed, and when
it is moving, the white irregular lines with which it is beset are
not evident. _Trichoniscus pusillus_ is very much like _Trichoniscus
vividus_ in colour but the latter species is nearly twice as big and
has from five to seven joints to the flagellum, while the former has
never more than four. _Trichoniscus roseus_ is also much larger and
its bright red colour (which it loses, however, when preserved in
alcohol) is another means of distinguishing it from the species under
consideration.

Professor Sars in his _Crustacea of Norway_ (p. 162) describes from
Christiania, under the name of _Trichoniscus pygmaeus_, a still smaller
species. As this may possibly be discovered in this country a brief
comparison between it and _Trichoniscus pusillus_ may be of value.
The former reaches a length of but two millimetres; it is "whitish,
semi-pellucid with a few light brown pigmentary ramifications across
the segments and a double row of irregular opaque patches along the
middle of its back" (p. 163). Its body is covered with minute tubercles
and there are only three joints to the flagellum; its movements are by
no means rapid.

[Illustration: FIG. 37.--FLAGELLUM AND LAST PEDUNCULAR JOINT OF THE
ANTENNA OF _Trichoniscus pusillus_.]

The body of _Trichoniscus pusillus_ is smooth and polished. It has four
joints to the flagellum--Dr. Scharff (63) says three or four--and it
moves quickly.

  1868  _Philougria vivida_ Bate and Westwood (1), Vol. II., pp. 458
         and 459, figs.

This species is claret-brown in colour and under a lens it is seen
to be marbled with white, indeed in appearance it is much like
_Trichoniscus pusillus_ though twice the size. There are important
differences between the two species as regards the number of joints to
the flagellum. These vary from five to seven in _Trichoniscus vividus_
while in the other, as already pointed out, there are not more than
four. The body is practically speaking smooth for it bears only very
small tubercles, widely separated. In _Trichoniscus vividus_ the
antennae lack the bristles which characterise those of the other species
in the genus. The species under consideration was discovered by Dr.
Kinahan in March, 1858, at Portlaw, Co. Waterford and is active even
amongst the snow.

  1898  _Trichoniscus roseus_ Sars (59), p. 163, pl. LXXIII., fig. 1.

The third British species of _Trichoniscus_ is of a deep pink colour
and has a light yellow stripe down the back (in some habitats the
animals are said to be quite white). Arranged in transverse rows upon
the body are large tubercles, each of which under strong magnification
will be found to end in a tiny hair. It is distinguished from
_Trichoniscus pusillus_ by the larger size of its body, which is
also comparatively broader, and from _Trichoniscus vividus_ by the
four joints of the flagellum of its antennae which latter have strong
bristles upon them. In the former species there are five or more joints
to the flagellum and the antennae, though hairy, lack the bristles.
_Trichoniscus roseus_ is to be looked for in old gardens.

_Abdomen narrow; eyes simple; (or wanting); flagellum, with four
joints._

The members of this genus are very much like those of _Trichoniscus_.
In the latter, however, the hinder legs are longer in proportion and
the eyes are compound.

=Trichoniscoides albidus= Budde-Lund. PLATE VI.

  1879  _Trichoniscus albidus_ Budde-Lund (7) p. 9.

         fig. 2.

[Illustration: FIG. 40.--FLAGELLUM AND LAST PEDUNCULAR JOINT OF THE
ANTENNA OF _Trichoniscoides albidus_.]

We are able to include this species, as a specimen was found by Mr.
Webb at Eton Wick in the summer of 1899. It is one of a number of
species which the Rev. Canon Norman (49, p. 18) suggested as likely to
be British. It is the only representative of its genus, which does not
differ in any very important characters from the others in the family.
The narrow elongated body will serve to separate it from _Trichoniscus
vividus_ and _Trichoniscus roseus_, but on account of its size, which
is much the same as that of _Trichoniscus pusillus_ and the two British
species of _Haplophthalmus_, it will be advisable to give some further
points of distinction. From the first its white colour will serve
to differentiate it; the other two lack the narrow abdomen seen in
_Trichoniscoides albidus_. Moreover, not one of the three shows the
serrations on the side plates which characterise the species under
consideration. _Platyarthrus hoffmannseggii_ is small and white and
the edges of its side plates are toothed, but it is oval in shape,
possesses no eyes, and its stout antennae have but a single joint to the
flagellum instead of four. On the Continent this species has been found
in rich soil.

_Genus_--=HAPLOPHTHALMUS= Schoebl, 1850 (66), p. 449.

_Abdomen broad (comparatively); eyes simple; flagellum with three
joints; back with longitudinal ridges._

The body of _Haplophthalmus_ is long in proportion to its width, but
there is no abrupt decrease in the breadth of the abdomen as seen in
_Trichoniscus_ and _Trichoniscoides_. The eyes are simple as in the
latter genus and the lateral lobes of the head are rather large, while
the side plates of the body are well separated.

  1898  _Haplophthalmus mengii_ Sars (59), p. 167, pl. LXXIV.,
         fig. 1.

The Rev. Canon Norman discovered two specimens of this species in
Ireland in June, 1900 (50); in the previous year one of us (Mr. Webb)
found a single example at Eton Wick.

The main differences between the members of this genus and their allies
are set forth in the generic description and incidentally elsewhere, so
we shall content ourselves with giving the distinctive points of the
two British species. _Haplophthalmus mengii_ has a number of raised
longitudinal ribs on each segment of the thorax, the outer ridges being
somewhat broken. There are also two prominent ribs upon the third
segment of the abdomen.

This species was added to the British list by the Rev. Canon Norman
(49), who found a colony in his garden at Berkhamsted. It has rows of
tubercles on its thorax instead of ridges, and there are no ribs at all
upon the abdomen. The front of the head projects further comparatively
and forms a more acute point than in _Haplophthalmus mengii_ and it is
not so purely white in colour as the latter species.

_Oniscus asellus_ is one of the largest of our woodlice and it is also
probably the commonest, though _Porcellio scaber_ is in many places
quite as abundant. The body of _Oniscus_ is broad and expanded and the
colour is usually a slate grey with yellowish markings more or less
regularly arranged.

From the genus _Porcellio_ the species with which we are concerned
is at once distinguished by the three jointed flagellum. _Porcellio_
has but two joints and has, besides, a prominent lobe projecting from
the middle of the head, which is not seen in _Oniscus_. _Philoscia_,
although it has three joints to the flagellum, has a narrow abdomen
and lacks entirely the lateral lobes which are a feature of the other
genera of Oniscidae.

_Oniscus fossor_ of Koch (34) was recognized by Kinahan and by Bate and
Westwood as a species. Dr. Scharff submitted specimens to Professor
Budde-Lund who found no differences between them and _Oniscus asellus_.
The former (63) mentions, however, that the characteristics of the
supposed species are those of young examples of _Oniscus asellus_, and
Professor Sars (59, p. 173) seems to be of the same opinion. Many young
examples of _Oniscus asellus_ that we have examined have a curious
whitish transverse band owing to the light colour of the dorsal plates
of the first abdominal segments. The flagellum also does not seem to
shew in young animals a distinct division into three joints.

If any further differences of an obvious kind be required to
distinguish _Philoscia_ from _Oniscus_, one at least will be found in
the much greater development of the hinder legs in the former genus.

This species lives chiefly at the roots of grass and under the stones
or sticks that lie among it. _Philoscia muscorum_ has a very smooth and
shining body, and its long legs enable it to move very rapidly. The
ground colour of its dorsal surface varies from light yellow to deep
brown. There are characteristic dark markings down the middle of the
thorax and on the sides, between which are lighter patches. In dark
coloured specimens the markings are by no means so evident.

_Philoscia couchii_ is an inhabitant of the sea-side; it is smaller
than the last species, its colour to the naked eye is a uniform
lead-grey, and its antennae are very large (compared with its size) and
hairy.

This species was discovered by Professor Kinahan when in the company of
Messrs. Bate and Westwood near Polperro in Cornwall in the year 1858,
and dried specimens presented by him are in the British Museum (Natural
History).

Up to the present this is the only woodlouse which has been found in
the nests of British ants. It is small and oval, its colour is white,
and its body is covered with tubercles. The edges of its side plates
are toothed, its flagellum has but a single joint and it has no eyes.

Miss Kate Hall tells us that, if very hungry, ants in captivity will
kill and eat _Platyarthrus_. With regard to its own food, Lord Avebury
has favoured us with the opinion that it lives on the spores of the
lower plants, such as would be found in the ants' nest.

  NOTE.--In the genera which follow, air-tubes or air-cavities
     (tracheae) are present in the outer plates of the abdominal
     appendages, 1 and 2, or 1 to 5. The appendages in question have
     in consequence a milk-white appearance in the living animal
     owing to the fact that the enclosed air reflects white light.
     Considerable interest attaches to the study of these tracheae,
     which have the same function as those of insects, but which have
     been independently developed. To emphasise the latter fact the
     structures are often termed "pseudotracheae."

_Genus_--=PORCELLIO= Latreille, 1804 (37), p. 45.

_Flagellum, with two joints; abdomen, broad; frontal lobe projecting._

_Porcellio_ is easily separated from the previous genera--_Oniscus_,
_Philoscia_, and _Platyarthrus_--by its two-jointed flagellum. The
fact that the abdomen is not abruptly narrowed separates it from
_Metoponorthus_, which also lacks the prominent frontal lobe so
characteristic of _Porcellio_. The species of this genera might be
confused with _Cyclisticus_ which has two joints to the flagellum and
a broad abdomen, but the latter genus has the power of rolling itself
into a ball, while its frontal lobe is very small, and the first
segment of its thorax is comparatively larger than in any species of
_Porcellio_.

The body of _Porcellio scaber_ is densely covered with tubercles. Its
colour is usually of a very dark grey, but at times it is quite red or
variegated with yellow. Albino specimens have been recorded. The two
joints of the flagellum are of the same length and together equal that
of the last joint of the peduncle. Air-tubes are present in the outer
plates of the first two abdominal appendages.

There are tubercles on the body of _Porcellio pictus_, which is a
striking looking animal. Its head is black with the lateral lobes
curved outwards; there is a dark band down the middle of the back and
commonly two others on each side, with more or less conspicuous yellow
markings between.

The distal (terminal) joint of the flagellum is but half the length of
the proximal one and the last peduncular joint is longer than the two
combined.

The abdominal appendages--1 and 2--are provided with air-tubes.

  1868  _Porcellio dilatatus_ Bate and Westwood (1), p.

The fact that _Porcellio dilatatus_ is more than half as broad as it is
long, at once distinguishes it from the other species of _Porcellio_.
It is tuberculated and of somewhat a lighter grey than _Porcellio
scaber_ usually is. The two species agree in having the two joints of
the flagellum equal, but the last peduncular joint, as in _Porcellio
pictus_, is longer than the flagellum.

As in the two preceding species, air-tubes are found in the outer
plates of the appendages on the first two abdominal segments.
_Porcellio dilatatus_ is to be looked for near houses.

  1853  _Porcellio tetramoerus_ Schnitzler (65), p. 24.
  1853  _Porcellio striatus_ Schnitzler (65), p. 24.

There is often a light band down the back and one on either side of it
near the margin in _Porcellio rathkei_ (especially in the males), with
other more irregularly arranged light patches between. Unlike the three
species previously considered, the present one has a smooth body. The
distal joint of the flagellum is the longer, and the flagellum itself
is equal in length to the last joint of the peduncle.

Some specimens found by Mr. Webb in 1899 at Eton were submitted to Mr.
Stebbing, and since then the former has found _Porcellio rathkei_ to
be pretty generally distributed in West Middlesex, where the species
appears to frequent the open fields.

Air-tubes occur in abdominal appendages 1 to 5 and the white appearance
of all of these at once serves to distinguish the living animal from
_Porcellio scaber_ in which the first two pairs of abdominal appendages
alone are white.

Another smooth species is _Porcellio laevis_. The colour of its body
is light grey with irregular white markings. The large size of this
species and the very long tail-appendages of the males are features
which will help to identify it. The distal joint of the flagellum is
slightly the longer and as in the last species (_P. rathkei_) the
flagellum is equal in length to the last joint of the peduncle. The
chief habitats for this species are among vegetable rubbish near human
dwellings.

Only the first two abdominal appendages contain air-tubes.

  1898  _Porcellio ratzeburgii_ Sars (59), p. 182, pl. LXXX, fig. 1.

There are granulations on the middle of the segments in _Porcellio
ratzeburgii_ and the sides of its body are more nearly parallel than
in the other species of _Porcellio_; the frontal lobe is, practically
speaking, semicircular and the lateral plates of the thorax flank the
head to a considerable extent. As in _Porcellio pictus_, the dark band
is in the middle of the back. The distal joint of the flagellum is
nearly twice as long as the proximal, and the flagellum is shorter than
the last joint of the peduncle. This species was added to the British
list by Mr. Webb (74) in 1898.

_Porcellio ratzeburgii_ agrees with _Porcellio rathkei_ in having
air-tubes in the first five abdominal appendages.

_Flagellum, with two joints; abdomen, narrow; frontal lobe not
developed._

The hinder legs of _Metoponorthus_ are proportionately longer than in
any other Oniscidae save _Philoscia_. Both genera have a narrow abdomen,
but _Philoscia_ has an extra joint to the flagellum, and shows no sign
of lateral lobes to the head.

Undamaged specimens of _Metoponorthus pruinosus_ are of a beautiful
bluish-grey colour, owing to a "bloom" which is easily brushed off,
revealing a dark reddish-brown tint beneath it. The antennae are long
and have white markings upon them.

Air-tubes occur in the first two abdominal appendages.

  (2.) Able to roll up into a ball.

_Genus_--=CYLISTICUS= Schnitzler, 1853 (65), p. 24.

_Flagellum, with two joints; abdomen broad; frontal lobe, very small._

The characters given immediately above are almost those of _Porcellio_
with which _Cylisticus_ might, perhaps, be confounded. The latter
has the power, however, of rolling itself into a ball, and the first
segment of the thorax is comparatively larger than in any species of
_Porcellio_, indeed the side plates of the segment in question entirely
flank the head. These features, as well as the straight sides of the
body and the arched back, connect _Cylisticus_ with _Armadillidium_,
from which the former is, however, at once separated by its long
pointed tail appendages.

=Cylisticus convexus= De Geer. PLATE XXI.

  1868  _Porcellio armadilloides_ Bate and Westwood (1), p. 485.
  1898  _Cylisticus convexus_ Sars (59), p. 186, pl. LXXXI.

There is but a single species of _Cylisticus_ found in this country,
so that it is not necessary for us to go into much further detail with
regard to it. _Cylisticus convexus_ has the two joints of the flagellum
about equal, and they together in turn closely approximate in length to
the last joint of the peduncle. Mr. Stebbing says, in a letter, that
British examples do not appear to have the "white tail-piece" seen in
Continental ones. It is not noticeable in the preserved specimens which
we have seen from Berkhamsted and Leixlip, but it is very evident in
the living ones found at Hanwell and Maidstone.

The abdominal appendages 1 to 5 are provided with air-tubes.

_Family_--ARMADILLIDIIDAE.

=Tail appendages not projecting when the animal is walking.=

_Genus_--=ARMADILLIDIUM= Brandt, 1833 (3), p. 184.

_Flagellum, with two joints; outer division of the tail appendages
expanded and broader at the hinder end._

The members of the genus _Armadillidium_ are more likely to be
confounded, by the uninitiated, with the "Pill-millipedes" than with
other Woodlice. Excepting _Cylisticus_ (which has long pointed tail
appendages) no other British forms have the power of rolling themselves
up into a complete ball. The very arched body is characteristic of
_Armadillidium_, and so is the groove into which the basal joints of
the antennae fit when the creatures curl up.

The first two abdominal appendages only are provided with air-tubes.

=Armadillidium nasatum= Budde-Lund. PLATE XXII.

  1885  _Armadillidium nasatum_ Budde-Lund (8), p. 51.
  1892  _Armadillidium nasatum_ Dollfus (14), p. 10, fig. 12.
  1899  _Armadillidium nasatum_ Norman (misprinted _Porcellidium_) (49),
         p. 57. pl. VI., figs. 5-8.

_Armadillidium nasatum_ has a narrow but very prominent frontal lobe,
which is almost square and curves somewhat upwards and backwards. The
joints of the flagellum are approximately equal, and are together of
the same length as the last peduncular joint.

The telson is as long as it is broad at the base, and tapers to a
roundish point, while its sides are slightly incurved.

[Illustration: FIG. 56.--FLAGELLUM AND LAST PEDUNCULAR JOINT OF THE
ANTENNA OF _Armadillidium nasatum_.]

The outer divisions of the tail appendages are considerably longer than
broad, and are more or less paddle-shaped.

It will be noticed that the slope from thorax to telson is more gentle
than in the common species, _Armadillidium vulgare_, and the first
thoracic segment is not so greatly developed. Consequently the species
which we are considering does not produce a perfect sphere, and the
antennae are not hidden when it rolls up. It is interesting to compare
this species with _Cylisticus convexus_. The surface of the body is
smooth, and its colour is a delicate brownish grey with more or less
distinct rows of darker markings.

_BRITISH LOCALITIES:--_

  _England_: Maldon; (W.M.W. from R.M.): Bluebell Hill, Maidstone

  1839   _Armadillo trivialis_ Koch (34), part 28, pl. XIV.
  1898   _Armadillidium vulgare_ Sars (59), p. 189, pl. LXXXII.

The common pill woodlouse is _Armadillidium vulgare_. Its frontal
lobe is not large, though it is broad, while its margin where it
joins the head is rounded and slightly recurved. The proximal joint
of the flagellum is somewhat the shorter and the two together, as in
_Armadillidium nasatum_, are of about the same length as the last joint
of the peduncle.

The telson has the form of a triangle with the angles truncated and is
about as long as it is broad at the base. The outer divisions of the
tail appendages are considerably broader than they are long.

The species can roll itself up into a very perfect sphere, and when
it assumes this form its antennae are hidden beneath the much expanded
lateral plates of the first thoracic segment.

[Illustration: FIG. 57.--FLAGELLUM AND LAST PEDUNCULAR JOINT OF THE
ANTENNA OF _Armadillidium vulgare_.]

The body is smooth, shiny, and strongly arched. Its colour varies very
considerably, generally it is of a slaty-grey, but yellow markings are
often present to a greater or less extent. In a specimen before us
(from Bluebell Hill, Maidstone) the head is of a uniform dark grey,
the sides of the thorax are yellow, while the back is mottled with the
same colour. The abdomen, including the telson, is also yellow with the
exception only of the tail appendages, which are dark grey.

  1898  _Armadillidium pulchellum_ Sars (59), p. 191, pl. LXXXIII.,
         fig. 4.

The smallest British species is _Armadillidium pulchellum_. The frontal
lobe projects so as to make the head somewhat triangular. The antennae
are very short and the distal joint of the flagellum is three times the
length of the other, while the two together are not as long as the last
peduncular joint.

[Illustration: FIG. 58.--FLAGELLUM AND LAST PEDUNCULAR JOINT OF THE
ANTENNA OF _Armadillidium pulchellum_.]

The telson is truncated at the end so that it is by no means as long as
it is broad at the base, and the outer divisions of the tail appendages
are in similar proportion.

The colour of the body (which is smooth) is dark brown with four
important series of light patches running down the back and less marked
variegations between them.

_BRITISH LOCALITIES:--_

  _England_: Matlock; (T.R.R.S.) Arnside; Westmorland (Brady, 50a).

  1833  _Armadillidium depressum_ Brandt (3), p. 82. pl. XII.,
         figs, 4, 5, 6, C, D.
  1892  _Armadillidium depressum_ Dollfus (14), p. 17-18.

The frontal lobe in _Armadillidium depressum_ is very prominent and
much recurved. The antennae are fairly long and while the two joints
of the flagellum are nearly equal they are together not so long as
the last peduncular joint.

[Illustration: FIG. 59.--FLAGELLUM AND LAST PEDUNCULAR JOINT OF THE
ANTENNA OF _Armadillidium depressum_.]

The telson is slightly longer than it is broad at the base, and its
sides are incurved. As in _Armadillidium vulgare_ and _Armadillidium
pulchellum_ the outer divisions of the tail appendages are broader
than they are long.

The body is flatter than in the other species and bears tubercles; its
colour is a slate-grey with yellowish markings. The first thoracic
segment is well developed and the head appears as if almost completely
imbedded in it.

_BRITISH LOCALITIES:--_

  _England_: Clifton, banks of the Avon; (W.M.W. from J.T.C., 1900):
     Shirehampton, near Bristol; (Stebbing in 49): Clifton; (Dollfus

_FOREIGN DISTRIBUTION:--_

  _Europe_: France; Italy; (25): Asia Minor; (14, quoting Brandt).

=Distribution of Species.= There are not sufficient records at present
to enable us to draw any conclusions as to the general distribution of
Woodlice in the British Isles, but it is hoped that more attention will
be given to these creatures, and that before long there may be other
material available.

=Conclusion.= At the beginning it was mentioned that the present work
grew out of an investigation into the fauna of Essex, and in order
to show what may be expected when places are explored in which no
collecting has been done, we may briefly indicate the results which we
obtained in the county in question.

It was not long before a species new to Britain--to wit, _Porcellio
ratzeburgii_--was found (74). This discovery was mentioned by Mr.
Stebbing in the _Victoria County History of Essex_ (p. 71), and he
prophesied that most of the British species then would be met with in
the county. We may safely claim to have shown that his prediction was
true, for we have been able to record in the preceding pages no less
than sixteen other species, as will be seen from the following lists:--

_WOODLICE RECORDED FROM ESSEX._

  1. _Ligia oceanica_
  2. _Ligidium hypnorum_
  3. _Trichoniscus pusillus_
  4. _Trichoniscus roseus_
  5. _Haplophthalmus danicus_
  6. _Oniscus asellus_
  7. _Philoscia muscorum_
  8. _Platyarthrus hoffmannseggii_
  9. _Porcellio scaber_
  10. _Porcellio pictus_
  11. _Porcellio dilatatus_
  12. _Porcellio laevis_
  13. _Porcellio ratzeburgii_
  14. _Metoponorthus pruinosus_
  15. _Cylisticus convexus_
  16. _Armadillidium nasatum_
  17. _Armadillidium vulgare_

Of these _Ligidium hypnorum_ calls for special mention, as it had not
been found in this country since Mr. Stebbing discovered it in Surrey
in 1873. Several of the Porcellios and _Cylisticus convexus_ have been
met with in but few places, and the same may be said of _Armadillidium
nasatum_.

Of the British species not as yet found in Essex _Trichoniscus vividus_
has at present only been recorded from Ireland; _Philoscia couchii_ and
_Armadillidium depressum_ have not been collected except in the extreme
south west of England, while _Metoponorthus cingendus_ has hitherto
only been noticed in Devonshire and Ireland. The other four species,
with the exception of _Porcellio rathkei_, which is well distributed
in west Middlesex (and might have been expected to occur in Essex),
are still rare. In fact, for _Trichoniscoides albidus_ but two British
localities are known; for _Haplophthalmus mengii_ three (two in England
and one in Ireland); while _Armadillidium pulchellum_ has only been
recorded from two or three places.

In other counties quite as satisfactory results were obtained as in
Essex--a systematic search in Buckinghamshire brought to light at Eton
three species which at the time had not been recorded from the British
Isles, while in Middlesex, no less than a dozen species were found at
Hanwell.

Since part of this contribution was printed our attention has been
drawn to some notes by the Rev. Canon Norman and Professor G. S. Brady
(50a). These bear out the remarks which have already been made, for
among the species found by Professor Brady in the north of England
were _Trichoniscoides albidus_, _Haplophthalmus mengii_, _Porcellio
rathkei_, and _Armadillidium pulchellum_. In one of Canon Norman's
previous papers (50--1903) he claims to have added the second species
to the British list, and in the notes in question a similar claim is
made with regard to the first and third. It should, however, be pointed
out that all three of them were found in Buckinghamshire in 1899 by Mr.
Webb, and that they were exhibited at the Nature Study Exhibition held
in London in August, 1902. A specimen of _Armadillidium pulchellum_
from Matlock was sent to us by the Rev. T. R. R. Stebbing in January,
1904, and was found, we understand, some considerable time previously.

It only remains for us to express our hearty thanks to the numerous
friends and correspondents who have given us their ready help. The
names of these have been printed in the text, but we would like to
mention more particularly Dr. Calman, of the British Museum (Natural
History), Monsieur Adrian Dollfus, Mr. Roland Matthams, the Rev. Canon
Norman, Dr. Scharff, the Rev. T. R. R. Stebbing, and Miss Willmott.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
