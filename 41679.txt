ALWAYS BEFORE THE PUBLIC,

while the daily paper is old in one day, and the weekly in seven, the
magazine is fresh and new for a month, after which it is frequently kept
for years, and finally in a bound volume, takes its place among the
standard works on the library shelf. It is seldom, or never, that the
magazine finds itself consigned to the waste basket.

We clip the following from the _Boston Herald_ of June 4th:

DOES ADVERTISING PAY?

      The proprietors of a household article recently
      informed the publishers of a well-known monthly
      magazine of large circulation that the insertion of a
      small advertisement twice in the pages of their
      magazine had brought in more than eight thousand
      inquiries. And yet some people are still wondering if
      newspaper and magazine advertising pays?

A PICTURE.


    Dainty little Marguerite,
      Tripping down the stair,
    With the dancing sunlight
      In her golden hair,

    Through the open doorway,
      In the sunny brightness,
    Where the morning-glories
      Nod in airy lightness.

    Mamma, coming downwards,
      Sees her darling stand,
    Snowy ruffled apron
      Held in either hand,

    Making stately courtesy
      With a childlike grace,
    And a reverent brightness
      On her upturned face.

    "What art doing, baby?"
      Called the mother's voice,
    While the pretty picture
      Made her heart rejoice.

    Morning-glories kissed the curls
      The open brow adorning,
    As the little maid replied,
      "I'm wishing God good morning."

NAUGHTY NASNA.


[Illustration]

Nasna was a coati-mondi, a cousin of the raccoon family. She was about
the size of a cat, with thick, coarse fur, brown on the back and sides,
and shading from yellow to orange underneath. She had a head and four
legs, and a fat body; but the two most important parts of her, in her
own opinion at least, were her nose and her tail. The tail was certainly
very handsome, long, and bushy, with black and yellow rings round it.
The nose was long, too,--long and sharp, and always poking, poking
itself everywhere. There never was such an inquisitive nose. Now it was
lifting the lid of a pot on the kitchen fire (for Nasna was tame, and a
great pet of her master's), and scalding itself with the steam; now it
was sniffing at a bottle of strong ammonia, without seeming to be
troubled in the least by the smell; now it was in her master's pocket,
trying to find out what it was that went "Tick! tick!"

[Illustration]

But what do you think the nose did one day? oh! _what_ do you think it
did? You never could guess, and so I must tell you.

[Illustration]

The old cat had been asleep beside the kitchen fire. She had had a
long, long nap,--the sleepy old cat,--and when she woke up she felt that
she needed a long, long stretch before she was quite herself again. Now,
the way in which the old cat stretched herself was this: she put her
four feet close together, and humped her back just as high as she could
possibly hump it; then she stretched herself, and opened her mouth to
its fullest extent, and said, "Mu-aw-yu-aouw!"

[Illustration]

This was a singular performance. Nasna had never seen it before, and
when she saw the red mouth open, wide, wider, widest, she immediately
said to herself, "Dear me! how very odd! I wonder what there is inside
that red cavern? I'm going to look!" and the next moment the long,
velvety nose was poked right into the old cat's mouth, and almost down
her throat.

Did the old cat shut her mouth? She did, indeed, my child; and who can
blame her for doing so? But there was a sound of woe in the air, and a
squealing as of a coati in despair, and the next moment Nasna was
crouching in the farthest corner of the room, holding her wounded nose
in both hands, and sneezing violently.

[Illustration]

But do not think that this was a lesson to Nasna; nothing of the kind!
The very next morning she managed to find her way into the dining-room
when the master and mistress were at breakfast. She climbed up at once
into the mistress' lap, and poked her nose at the shining coffee-pot.
Ah! it was hot. Pop went the nose into the cup of coffee that was
steaming beside the mistress' plate. Oh! that was hotter.

"I won't stay here any longer, to be treated so!" cried Nasna; and down
she jumped to the floor.

Buzz! buzz! what is that by the window? Something small, flying about,
with a black and yellow jacket on. See, now it is crawling on the floor,
and Nasna can catch it. Nasna does catch it, putting her soft paw on it.
Mr. Wasp extends his sting, as the utmost he has to offer. Nasna squeaks
wofully, but does not understand yet, so puts her nose down instead of
her paw. This time there is no doubt about the matter, and she retires
in great anguish to the kitchen.

[Illustration]

One day as she was playing about, tettered by a string to a chair, her
master took an egg and placed it on the floor, at a very provoking
distance. Nasna could just touch it with one paw, but could not get hold
of it. She tried with fore paws, she tried with hind paws; but all in
vain: she only succeeded in rolling the egg a little further off. What
was to be done? She sat down and looked at the egg long and
thoughtfully. At last she put her head on one side and winked: she had
an idea. She turned her back on the coveted treasure, and backed towards
it as far as she could. Then she grasped her tail with one paw,
stiffened it and curved the tip almost into a hook, and, touching the
egg with this hook, slowly and cautiously rolled it round in front of
her, till she could reach it with her fore paw. Then, in triumph and
much pride, she sat up on her haunches, cracked the egg, and sucked it,
without spilling a drop. Clever Nasna! I think she deserved a good
breakfast, don't you?

"CHOW-CHOW."


"Chow-Chow" was not a pickle, but a chicken, and a real funny one, too.

I made friends with him when he was no bigger than a robin. He was an
only child; of course his mother had enough to do to pet and fuss over
him. But he would leave her any time when we called "Chow-Chow." We gave
him this funny name because he was a great talker. All he said was
"C-h-o-w-C-h-o-w," and then "_Chow-Chow-Chow-Chow_" as fast as he could
talk.

[Illustration]

His mother was a beautiful buff Shanghai, but he was a long-legged
Brahma, dressed in a speckled black and gray suit. As the days got
chilly, in the fall, it seemed as if he suffered dreadfully from cold
feet. He was always cuddling down in the warm feathers on his mother's
back, even when he was a pretty big fellow.

One day I said, "Come, 'Chow-Chow,' don't trouble your mother. I'll give
you a good warming by the kitchen fire." I carried him into the kitchen,
opened the oven door, and gave his cold feet a good toasting. Oh, how he
enjoyed it! He opened and shut his claws as he lay on my lap, and
_chow-chowed_, and pecked at the buttons of my dress.

The next day it was pretty cold, and the first thing I heard when I
went into the kitchen was a tapping at the window-pane. There was
"Chow-Chow" on the window-sill, pecking at the glass, and holding up one
foot, and then the other. He was talking, or rather scolding, at the top
of his voice.

I let him in. He went straight to the stove, and waited for me to take
him in my arms and warm his feet. He seemed to think it was ever so much
nicer than his mother's feathers.

One cold morning I was busy when he came in. The stove was very hot, and
"Chow-Chow"--silly bird!--couldn't wait for me to attend to him. He flew
up on the top of the stove. Then he gave a scream, and landed on the
table. That was the first and last time he tried to warm his feet
without my help.

My sister always said that "Chow-Chow" was a hen. I felt sure he was a
rooster. She said, "The first we know 'Chow-Chow' will lay an egg." _I_
said, "The first we know 'Chow-Chow' will _crow_."

After a while I saw some bright red whiskers under his chin. Then such a
pretty coral comb. Still he only talked "Chow-Chow-Chow."

[Illustration]

But one morning he came into the kitchen in a great hurry. He jumped
upon the table, flapped his wings, and stretched his long neck, opened
his mouth, and, oh! such a queer noise! It was a squeak and a roar. I
ran upstairs to my sister. "It _is_ a rooster. Didn't you hear
'Chow-Chow' crow?"--"Do you call that a crow? Why, I heard an awful
noise, and wondered what it was."

But our chicken grew up one of the handsomest birds I ever saw. And in a
few weeks not a rooster in the neighborhood had such a musical, splendid
crow as our "Chow-Chow."

POLLY'S BABY.


    ALL in the daintiest cradle
      That baby could wish to own,
    It lay contentedly winking,
      Where Polly had left it alone.
    It wasn't a mere doll-baby;
      Ah, no! that Polly would scorn;
    But this she loved through the daytime,
      And dreamed of from night till morn.

    A cap its small head adorning,
      A robe of cambric so white,
    And round its waist, for a "dress up,"
      A ribbon so blue and bright!
    Its eyes were, Polly thought, lovely,
      Because they were gray, and she
    Was always brushing the soft hair,
      As black as black hair could be.

    [Illustration]

    But once our Polly was naughty,
      And struck her baby at last;
    When, lo! it jumped out of the cradle,
      And scampered from danger fast.
    Do you think that was strange for a baby--
      For Polly's wee baby--to do?
    Why, children, 'twas only a kitty,
      Brimful of mischief--and mew!

                        M. D. BRINE.




HICKORY, DICKORY, DOCK!


WEEZY was so eager to help that she made it hard for herself and for the
family. She burned her fingers in stirring hot apple-sauce for Bridget.
She woke the baby in trying to curl the few hairs on his little bald
head. She meddled with mamma's knitting-work till she had lost every
needle. Papa Haynes laughed at these things; but when Weezy learned to
open his writing-desk he looked grave.

[Illustration]

"This'll never do," said he to mamma. "The child will be tearing my
papers next."

So he locked the desk, and hung the key above the tall clock beside it.

"There, my young squirrel, you won't reach that in a hurry," he said to
himself, kissing his little daughter good-by.

After he was gone mamma stepped into the kitchen to tell Bridget about
dinner. Weezy stayed in the sitting-room to sing Sambo to sleep. Every
time she rocked back in her small chair she could see the key shining
over the clock. It looked very much out of place. She wondered why her
papa had put it there. She wanted to whistle with it. Oh hum! if she was
a little speck of a bird she would fly against it and brush it down with
her wings. Or if Sambo was only an angel! She danced across the floor,
and threw him up as high as she could. Instead of knocking down the key
she knocked poor Sambo's stocking-yarn head against the wall, and he
fell flat upon the top of the desk.

[Illustration]

"Lie still, Sambo," cried Weezy, mounting a chair. From the chair she
easily climbed to the broad shelf of the desk. There she rested a
moment, leaning her chin on the top of the desk and patting Sambo. But
she did not take him in her arms, for not far above him hung the key.
She had set her little heart on getting it.

What do you think the little sprite did next? All by herself she
scrambled to the very top of that big desk. Standing on tiptoe, she
tried to reach over the clock! Even then she was not quite tall enough
to grasp the key with her chubby little fingers; but by perching upon
Sambo she got it at last.

By the time mamma came back Weezy had opened the desk, and cut one of
papa's deeds into paper dolls.

Papa was vexed enough, at noon, when he saw them.

"The loss of that deed will give me a great deal of trouble," said he to
mamma. "How _did_ Weezy come by the key of my desk?"

    "'Hickory, dickory, dock,
     The mouse ran up the clock!'"

answered mamma, laughing.

"Why, why, is it possible!" said papa, turning pale. "I'm thankful she
didn't break her neck,--our little mouse of a Weezy."

A MEADOW SONG.


    A LITTLE daisy in a meadow grew,
    Kissed by the sunshine, and fed by the dew;
    And gayly she sang to the passers-by,
    "Was ever a daisy so happy as I?"

    Then the clover, hearing the daisy's voice,
    Began, in her own sweet way, to rejoice;
    And softly sang, to the prettiest tune,
    "What bliss to live and to grow in June!"

    The violet peeped from her mossy bed,
    And round her the sweetest fragrance shed,
    Till far and near, on the summer air,
    Floated the perfume, fresh and rare.

[Illustration]

    And the buttercup waked from a golden dream
    To join in the grateful and joyous theme,
    As daintily over the grass she stepped,
    The fresher and sweeter from having slept.

    The wild blue flag, with a laughing toss,
    Spanned her color the green across;
    "Ho! ho!" she cried. "Oh, how merry are we!"
    Skipping along in her flowery glee.

    The sweet-brier, growing beside the wall,
    Quickly blossomed to hear the call,
    And bent, with a gracious and royal mien,
    At the jubilant cries of "Our queen! our queen!"

    Then dandelion, golden head,
    To follow where the others led,
    Sung till the echoes, loud and long,
    Resounded with her joyous song.

    The cowslip rose, with a pleased surprise,
    And, donning a robe of gorgeous dyes,
    Sang in a voice so rich and sweet
    The concert now was quite complete.

    The meadow-lark, as he heard the song,
    Sprung from his nest to greet the throng;
    And, thrilled to his heart by the joyous lay,
    Flew, singing, aloft, in the merriest way.

    So, in the dewy meadow-grass,
    Where all may listen as they pass,
    Both bird and flower, in sweet attune,
    Make happier all the days of June.

[Illustration: OUR MOCKING BIRD.]


A MOCKING-BIRD made his home in a honeysuckle in front of our cosey
house. In Arkansas, where we live, this sweet shrub is evergreen. Last
year the honeysuckle died, and the bird lost his home; but he liked the
place, and he went with his family to the lattice-room, in the rear of
the house.

In this apartment he found an old travelling-bag, or gripsack, hanging
on a nail. Inside of it was an old soft hat. This seemed to be what the
bird wanted, and he made his nest in it. This was his home all winter,
and he was happy there. When the cold weather, which we sometimes have
in Arkansas, came, he went to the water bucket to drink, and we fed him
with crumbs from the porch.

We started the honeysuckle anew, and when it had climbed to the top of
the cedar pole it spread out its foliage like an umbrella. The
mocking-bird liked his old home, and he moved back to its branches in
the spring. He has a nice family in his nest, and they give us music at
all times, night and day.

The father bird was as brave as a soldier. His special aversion is a
large Newfoundland dog, who is one of our pets. The bird will dart down
upon the dog's back, and make war upon him with a peculiar noise, until
he drives him away. He does this because he thinks the dog will hurt the
young in the nest. When there are no little ones he takes no notice of
the dog.

We think this is a great deal better than keeping the birds in a cage.
They are tame, and stay with us all the time; but they will not allow
themselves to be caught.

TROTTIE'S DOINGS.


TROTTIE is a cunning little boy, not quite three years old. His cradle
is a little netted hammock. It is fastened at one end to his mamma's
sewing-machine, and at the other to a hook in the wall. When Trottie
grows tired he does not trouble his mamma, but gets into the little
hammock and rocks himself to sleep.

One day the door-bell rang. The little fellow picked up his mother's
best bonnet, which she had placed upon the bed. Crushing it down over
his little golden curly head he hastened to the door.

[Illustration]

He found the minister there, a tall, stately gentleman, wearing a
stove-pipe hat. Trottie's strange appearance made the gentleman laugh,
and he asked, "Where are you going, my little man?"

Trottie made no answer, but, after a prolonged stare at the stove-pipe
hat, asked, "Are you Mr. Yankee Doodle?" Mamma came down just then.
Laughing, she invited the visitor in.

Not long afterwards Trottie thought he would like to churn. When his
mother's back was turned he put his two dear little kittens, "Starry
Eyes" and "Bluebell," into the churn, and poured a cup of water over
them. He was just lifting the dasher when his mother heard the kittens
mewing and took them out.

[Illustration]

He loves the kittens dearly, and would not hurt them for anything.

    WHEN the western light is fading,
      And the deepening shadows fall,
    When the night winds through the branches
      Softly to each other call;

    When in grassy country meadows
      Heavy hang the clovers red,
    And the stars begin to twinkle
      In the dusky arch o'erhead;

    When within the crowded city
      Spring the dark lamps into flame,
    And long rows of lighted windows
      Set the street as in a frame;

    When the busy hours are over,
      Cares and worries put away,
    And the evening enters softly
      After the retreating day;

    When the sound of homeward footsteps
      Echoes through the quiet street,
    Or the wayside grass is trampled
      By the tread of hurrying feet,--

    Then, in stately shining windows,
      Hung with misty laces white,
    Or in low-roofed cottage doorways
      Opening out into the night;

    With their merry voices silent,
      And their playthings put aside,
    Bright eyes, blue or black or hazel,
      All with eager watching wide,

    Stand a hundred little maidens,
      Looking out beneath the stars,
    Waiting in a hundred households
      For a hundred dear papas;

    And the quick, familiar footsteps
      Nearer through the darkness come,
    Till a hundred happy voices
      Cry at once their "Welcome home!"




THE PIGS' CHOWDER-PARTY.


DOWN at Cape Cod there lived two merry little twin brothers. Very full
of fun and mischief were they, and seldom quiet except when they were
asleep.

[Illustration]

One day their mamma bought some clams. She was going to have a chowder
for supper. For safe, cool keeping she put her basket of clams on the
grass, under a great tree.

[Illustration]

Johnnie and Willie stood by, and heard all that their mamma said about
it to auntie. They just looked and heard it all. Their baby faces--for
they were only a little over three years old--were as solemn as good old
Deacon Pitts', who said he "didn't see why people laughed when there was
no occasion."

These two baby-rogues put their bits of plump little hands into the
pockets of their pretty white aprons. When mamma and auntie went into
the house Nurse Jane sat down on the piazza, knitting in hand, to keep
an eye on them. They began to play bo-peep behind the lilac-bushes. When
Nurse Jane dropped off to sleep, as she should not have done, then it
was that these two small men turned their thoughts to other matters.
First, there was a wild chase after butterflies. Pretty soon they
trotted down the walk to see Mistress Piggy and her three lazy, grunting
children. When the pigs heard voices they, too, piped up, squealing out,
as Johnnie afterwards told his mamma, "Give _us_ some! give _us_ some!"

So at that call the laddies pelted Mistress Piggy and her children with
tufts of grass. Straying down the walk for more, they spied the basket
of clams. In a minute they were dragging the damp basket over the grass,
tugging away at the heavy load until their cheeks were scarlet. Then
such a pelting as Mistress Piggy and her family had. But they were wild
with the supper. They crunched and ate until all the clams were gone. A
pile of shells lay by the trough where their food was usually put. "They
had the chowder," Willie said.

Mamma and auntie had no chowder _that_ night!

I do not know what mamma said to her small boys, but I do know that they
went very early to bed.

PUSSY'S ADOPTED CHILDREN.


WHEN I was a little girl I had a dear old pussy. She was black and
white, handsome and dignified, yet a grand playfellow when she chose to
put off her dignity.

[Illustration]

Great was my delight, one lovely spring morning, to find that pussy had
two beautiful little babies in an old basket under the shed steps. She
was so glad to have me see them, and so proud of the little soft, plump
things, that she purred her loudest.

For three weeks mamma, kitty, and I nursed those babies with increasing
pleasure. Whenever she wanted to take the air, or call on a friend, I
was always ready to sit by the basket till she came back.

One sad night Thomas Gray, an old enemy of pussy's, broke into her house
and killed both those darlings. Their mother didn't shed a tear, but my
tears fell fast. The little creatures had just begun to be very cunning,
and my disappointment was sore.

Over in the brick house across the street was another mamma kitty, with
five nice children. They were about the same age as our kittens. Two
were very like ours; so I got the idea of begging for them, and giving
them to my pussy. Away I ran to ask my mamma's friend in the brick house
if she would give me two of her kittens. She laughed, and said, "I wish
you would take them all."

I carried home the two I wanted, and gave them to our sad pussy as she
lay by the kitchen stove. At first she sniffed at them eagerly, but they
didn't smell one bit like her own sweet babies. Then she was angry at
the trick I seemed to be playing. Her eyes looked fierce. She rose up,
growled, and spit at the little strangers, and tried to run away. But I
held her while Mary, the girl, brought some milk in a saucer. Kitty was
hungry, and so were the little ones; they tried to lap the milk with
her, but they could only wet their bits of noses, and nearly sneezed
their ears off.

Then they cried piteously, and looked at our pussy mother in such an
appealing way that it seemed to touch her. In a little while she curled
down on the floor and let them take her own babies' places.

Presently she began to wash their little heads, and then to sing "gray
thrums" to them. At last she made up her mind that they were very nice
little things, and she would be a good mother to them. And she was.
Nobody would ever guess that they were not her own children.

SEVEN TIMES ONE.


    MERRY-Sunshine-Bluebell girl,
    All my fond thoughts fly and furl,
    Close their wings about your head.
    May dear angels round you spread
    Joy from morn to setting sun,--
    For to-day you're "seven times one."

    Winds that fly from you to me
    Early, gently, ceaselessly,
    Whisper, "We have seen her wake,
    Gifts and kisses shyly take;
    We have touched her dainty cheek,
    Heard her gayly, sweetly speak
    Of the day that makes her seven,--
    Golden day from morn to even."

    Down I wander to the glen,
    Meeting whispers there again:
    Leaves that shake, and waves that whirl,
    Murmur of my birthday girl.
    Soft the leaves are, like her hair,
    And the brook-foam is as fair.
    Over me the sapphire skies
    Shine like her own gentle eyes.
    Break, O brook, in bubbling laughter!
    Only half you copy after
    Her who came with morning sun,--
    Her who now is "seven times one."

    Little morning-glory child,
    Bright as morn, as morning mild,
    Twine and wreathe thy fragile soul,--
    Delicate as the waves that roll
    Here in rainbows to my feet,--
    Twine and wreathe thee in our hearts,
    Sheltered be from storm and smarts;
    Cover us with dainty bloom;
    In our love find sunny room
    For thy dreams, songs, sallies mild,
    Blessed morning-glory child!

WHAT KATY DID.


"KATY-DID-IT! Katy-did-it!" sang the katy-dids in the trees. Who was
Katy, and what did she do, that all night long the insects sang about
her?

[Illustration]

Who was Katy? Why, a pretty little girl, six years old. Such a merry
little girl that every one loved her. Katy had come out to stay with
Grandma Lee. Mamma's sister was very sick, and mamma had gone to nurse
her. Papa sent Katy and little Tom, with their nurse, to grandma's.

Grandma Lee lived in the country, in a large house, with a beautiful
garden to it. Back of the garden was the barn, where Katy liked to hunt
for eggs, and play in the hay. So Katy played from morning till night at
grandma's, and was very happy.

One warm afternoon she thought she would go into the parlor and get a
book that had beautiful pictures in it. It was on a table that had a
scarf hanging over the edge. When Katy reached to get it she pulled the
table-scarf off. Down fell the book and a large vase, which was broken
all to pieces.

"Oh, dear!" said Katy, "grandma will be so angry. I am afraid to tell
her."

Little Tom had followed Katy in, and now stood beside her. Just then
Katy heard grandma coming, and ran out on the porch.

She heard grandma say, "You naughty boy, to break grandma's pretty
vase!"

[Illustration]

Then Katy thought grandma will never know it was I who did it; for Tom
cannot talk, and he is always breaking things. I won't tell her I did
it. So she ran away, and did not come in till grandma called her. Then
grandma told her that Tom had gone into the parlor, and had broken the
vase by pulling the scarf off the table.

Katy did not say a word, but she could hardly eat her supper. When
little Tom came up to kiss her "Good-night," before nurse put him to
bed, she almost cried. But she thought it would not do to tell then. She
was glad when bed-time came, she felt so unhappy.

Katy slept in a little room that opened into grandma's. In the middle of
the night she heard a noise and waked up. The moon was shining into the
room, and it was almost as light as day. She heard something which
sounded like "Katy-did-it! Katy-did-it! Katy-did-it!"

She pulled the sheet over her head to shut out the noise; but still she
heard the singing, "Katy-did-it!"

"They mean me," said Katy. "I wish they would stop." But they only sang
the louder.

Katy could stand it no longer. She jumped out of bed and ran into
grandma's room, crying, "O grandma, grandma, Katy did it!"

Grandma jumped up, saying, "Why, child! what's the matter?"

"O grandma," sobbed Katy, "Tom did not do it; Katy did it."

"Did what?" asked grandma.

"I broke the vase," replied Katy, "and then let you think Tom did it."

Then Katy told grandma how the Katy-dids would not let her sleep till
she had told her all about it. Grandma said she hoped Katy would never
be afraid again to say "Katy did it," when she had done wrong. I think,
after that, she never was.

PULL THE WEEDS.


    PULL the weeds, my little maid,
      That's good work to do;
    Better drop the ugly spade,--
      It's too big for you.
    In the onion bed, you see,
    Weeds with onions don't agree;
    Pull the weeds and set them free,
      Onions then will grow.

    Do you want to help me, dear,
      Very, very much?
    Careful walk along right here,
      And you must not touch;
    You must learn to keep the row;
    Pull the weeds where'er they grow;
    Soon you'll learn to use the hoe,
      Rake, and spade, and such.

[Illustration: THE WATERBURY WATCH.

THE WATERBURY WATCH.

THE WATERBURY

Time To Get Up Sister.]


A STRONG, SUBSTANTIAL ARTICLE.

  A STEM-WINDER.    CAN BE REGULATED PERFECTLY.    RUNS FOR 28 HOURS.

KEEPS IN ORDER WELL.

This is the merchant's Watch, the farmer's Watch, the miner's Watch, the
laborer's Watch, the boy's Watch, the school-girl's Watch--in fact
everybody's Watch. The Waterbury Watch Company has a national reputation
for making the

Best Cheap Watch in the World.

THE WATERBURY WATCH is a stem-winder, and will run 28 hours. The case is
Nickel-Silver, and will always remain as bright as a new silver dollar.
The Watch has a heavy beveled edge and crystal face. The works of the
Watch are made with the finest automatic machinery. Every Watch is
tested in varying positions and is perfect before leaving the factory.
Every Watch is put up in a handsome new improved satin-lined case for
safe transportation through the mails.

Teach your children to be on time. Give them a WATERBURY WATCH. No Boy
or Girl should be without one.

So perfect is the machinery used in making this Watch, and so exact are
all its parts, that if it needs repairs, if sent direct to the factory,
the charge for actual repairs (including parts used) never exceeds 50
cents. This will explain why they are so cheap and so easily repaired.

A FEW TESTIMONIALS--THOUSANDS MORE COULD BE GIVEN.

      [From Thomas A. Edison, Electrician, New York,
      February 10, 1885.]

      "I have used the Waterbury Watch for some time and
      find that it is the only one which will keep
      reasonably perfect time when used around powerful
      dynamo machines."

      The New York _Tribune_ says: "It is remarkable how
      quickly the Waterbury Watch has stepped into popular
      favor. No doubt, the secret of its instant success has
      been the fact of its excellence. No amount of
      advertising could push into favor a poor article. The
      Waterbury Watch is good and cheap."

      "I have carried a Waterbury for over a year and find
      it a most excellent time-keeper. It has run beside a
      $100 gold watch without showing the least
      variation."--F. G. PERRY, Wakefield, R. I.

      "My Waterbury after three years' trial continues to
      give satisfaction, and is now going as good as when I
      received it. At four o'clock daily we receive the time
      over our wire, and my watch is always prompt to the
      minute."--A. S. LETTS, Pennsylvania Railroad, Jersey
      City.

Parson Wilder Calls on Mrs. Puffy.

By Neil Burgess.

[Illustration]

"It did my soul good," said Mrs. Puffy, "to see old Parson Wilder come
in, the dear old soul; he looked as smiling as a basket of chips, and it
was a nice morning, the sun shining right into our setting-room; and, as
luck would have it, I'd just got all cleaned up and had put on a clean
calico and white apron, and, if I do say it, I looked as slick as a
whistle; and our garden--well, you'd oughter to seen it--a mass of
posies and blossoms everywhere; and as it had rained in the night
everything was as fresh as a cowcumber. 'Well, well!' says the parson,
'this is a picture one could never forget,' and he looked at my floor
and kitchen-table; they were both white as snow, and my milk-pans--well
you could just see your face in 'em, and everything was as neat as a
pink.

[Illustration]

"I cut him a pie and got him a pitcher of milk, cause I could see he was
powerful hungry, and when he got filled up he commenced: 'Cleanliness is
next to Godliness; now,' says he, 'what makes this home look so bright
and pure as the lily?' Says I 'It's Sapolio.'

[Illustration]

"'How?' says he, putting his hand to his ear, 'cause he's a little deaf.
'Sapolio!' I yelled in his ear. 'No,' says he, 'no; it's virtoo, moral
virtoo, that's er shining through it all,' and he kept that up till
supper time, and stayed and eat a big supper (I'm afraid they ain't er
feeding the old man as well up to his house as they oughter); and after
he had gone hum, I couldn't help thinking, as I looked at my floor,
table, pans and etceterer, that it may be moral virtoo shining through
'em, _but it takes Sapolio to fetch it out!_"

If your grocer does not keep Sapolio he can order it for you from any
wholesale grocer in the United States.

What is Sapolio?

It is a solid, handsome cake of scouring soap, which has no equal for
all cleaning purposes, except the laundry.

What will Sapolio do? Why, it will clean paint, make oil cloths bright.
You can scour the knives and forks with it, and make the tin things
shine brightly.

The wash basin, the bath tub, even the greasy kitchen sink, will be as
clean as a new pin if you use SAPOLIO.

For washing the hair only the very best soap and pure water should be
used.

The average soap contains too much free alkali, which draws the natural
oil from the hair and scalp, and leaves the former dry and lusterless
while it roughens the latter, causing scurf or dandruff.

The purity and mildness of the Ivory Soap gives it pre-eminence for
cleaning the hair and scalp. It contains no free alkali, so its use
insures a clean and healthy head of hair of the luster and softness of
silk.

THE FAMOUS ENGLISH

COMPLEXION SOAP.

HIS OPINION OF PEARS' SOAP

      If Cleanliness is next to Godliness, Soap must be
      considered as a Means of Grace and a Clergyman who
      recommends moral things should be willing to recommend
      Soap. I am told that my commendation of Pears' Soap
      has opened for it a large sale in the United States. I
      am willing to stand by every word in favor of it that
      I ever uttered. A man must be fastidious indeed who is
      not satisfied with it.

A SPECIALTY FOR THE SKIN & COMPLEXION,

As recommended by the greatest English authority on the Skin,

PROF. SIR ERASMUS WILSON, F. R. S.

Pres. of the Royal Col. of Surgeons, England.

Nothing adds so much to personal appearance as a =Bright, Clear
Complexion and a Soft Skin=. With these the plainest features become
attractive. Without them the handsomest are but coldly impressive.

_Many a complexion is marred by impure alkaline and Colored Toilet
Soap._

PEARS' SOAP

Is specially prepared for the delicate skin of ladies and children and
others sensitive to the weather, winter or summer. In England it is
pre-eminently the complexion Soap, and is recommended by all the best
authorities, as, on account of its emollient, non-irritant character,
=Redness, Roughness and Chapping are prevented, and a clear and bright
appearance and a soft, velvety condition imparted and maintained, and a
good, healthful and attractive complexion ensured=.

Its agreeable and lasting perfume, beautiful appearance, and soothing
properties commend it as the greatest luxury of the toilet. Its
durability and consequent economy is remarkable.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
