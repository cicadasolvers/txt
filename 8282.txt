Book 55 2 Timothy
001:001 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God,
        according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus,
001:002 to Timothy, my beloved child:  Grace, mercy, and peace,
        from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
001:003 I thank God, whom I serve as my forefathers did, with a
        pure conscience.  How unceasing is my memory of you in my petitions,
        night and day
001:004 longing to see you, remembering your tears, that I may be
        filled with joy;
001:005 having been reminded of the unfeigned faith that is in you;
        which lived first in your grandmother Lois, and your
        mother Eunice, and, I am persuaded, in you also.
001:006 For this cause, I remind you that you should stir up the gift
        of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands.
001:007 For God didn't give us a spirit of fear, but of power,
        love, and self-control.
001:008 Therefore don't be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord,
        nor of me his prisoner; but endure hardship for the Good News
        according to the power of God,
001:009 who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according
        to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace,
        which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal,
001:010 but has now been revealed by the appearing of our
        Savior, Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life
        and immortality to light through the Good News.
001:011 For this, I was appointed as a preacher, an apostle,
        and a teacher of the Gentiles.
001:012 For this cause I also suffer these things.  Yet I am not ashamed,
        for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded
        that he is able to guard that which I have committed to him
        against that day.
001:013 Hold the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me,
        in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.
001:014 That good thing which was committed to you, guard through
        the Holy Spirit who dwells in us.
001:015 This you know, that all who are in Asia turned away from me;
        of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.
001:016 May the Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus,
        for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain,
001:017 but when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently, and found me
001:018 (the Lord grant to him to find the Lord's mercy in that day);
        and in how many things he served at Ephesus, you know very well.
002:001 You therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is
        in Christ Jesus.
002:002 The things which you have heard from me among many witnesses,
        commit the same to faithful men, who will be able to
        teach others also.
002:003 You therefore must endure hardship, as a good soldier
        of Christ Jesus.
002:004 No soldier on duty entangles himself in the affairs of life,
        that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier.
002:005 Also, if anyone competes in athletics, he isn't crowned unless
        he has competed by the rules.
002:006 The farmers who labor must be the first to get a share
        of the crops.
002:007 Consider what I say, and may the Lord give you understanding
        in all things.
002:008 Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the seed of David,
        according to my Good News,
002:009 in which I suffer hardship to the point of chains as a criminal.
        But God's word isn't chained.
002:010 Therefore I endure all things for the chosen ones' sake, that they
        also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus
        with eternal glory.
002:011 This saying is faithful:  "For if we died with him, we will
        also live with him.
002:012 If we endure, we will also reign with him.  If we deny him,
        he also will deny us.
002:013 If we are faithless, he remains faithful.  He can't deny himself."
002:014 Remind them of these things, charging them in the sight
        of the Lord, that they don't argue about words, to no profit,
        to the subverting of those who hear.
002:015 Give diligence to present yourself approved by God,
        a workman who doesn't need to be ashamed, properly handling
        the Word of Truth.
002:016 But shun empty chatter, for they will proceed further in ungodliness,
002:017 and their word will consume like gangrene, of whom is
        Hymenaeus and Philetus;
002:018 men who have erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection
        is already past, and overthrowing the faith of some.
002:019 However God's firm foundation stands, having this seal,
        "The Lord knows those who are his,"{Numbers 16:5} and,
        "Let every one who names the name of the Lord{TR reads "Christ"
        instead of "the Lord"} depart from unrighteousness."
002:020 Now in a large house there are not only vessels of gold and
        of silver, but also of wood and of clay.  Some are for honor,
        and some for dishonor.
002:021 If anyone therefore purges himself from these, he will be a vessel
        for honor, sanctified, and suitable for the master's use,
        prepared for every good work.
002:022 Flee from youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love,
        and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.
002:023 But refuse foolish and ignorant questionings, knowing that
        they generate strife.
002:024 The Lord's servant must not quarrel, but be gentle towards all,
        able to teach, patient,
002:025 in gentleness correcting those who oppose him:  perhaps God may
        give them repentance leading to a full knowledge of the truth,
002:026 and they may recover themselves out of the devil's snare,
        having been taken captive by him to his will.
003:001 But know this, that in the last days, grievous times will come.
003:002 For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful,
        arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,
003:003 without natural affection, unforgiving, slanderers,
        without self-control, fierce, no lovers of good,
003:004 traitors, headstrong, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather
        than lovers of God;
003:005 holding a form of godliness, but having denied the power thereof.
        Turn away from these, also.
003:006 For of these are those who creep into houses, and take captive
        gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts,
003:007 always learning, and never able to come to the knowledge
        of the truth.
003:008 Even as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so do these also oppose
        the truth; men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith.
003:009 But they will proceed no further.  For their folly will be
        evident to all men, as theirs also came to be.
003:010 But you did follow my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith,
        patience, love, steadfastness,
003:011 persecutions, and sufferings:  those things that happened to me
        at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra.  I endured those persecutions.
        Out of them all the Lord delivered me.
003:012 Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus
        will suffer persecution.
003:013 But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse,
        deceiving and being deceived.
003:014 But you remain in the things which you have learned and have
        been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them.
003:015 From infancy, you have known the sacred writings which are
        able to make you wise for salvation through faith, which is
        in Christ Jesus.
003:016 Every writing inspired by God{literally, God-breathed} is
        profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction,
        and for instruction which is in righteousness,
003:017 that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped
        for every good work.
004:001 I charge you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ,
        who will judge the living and the dead at his appearing
        and his Kingdom:
004:002 preach the word; be urgent in season and out of season;
        reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with all patience and teaching.
004:003 For the time will come when they will not listen to the sound
        doctrine, but, having itching ears, will heap up for themselves
        teachers after their own lusts;
004:004 and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn
        aside to fables.
004:005 But you be sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work
        of an evangelist, and fulfill your ministry.
004:006 For I am already being offered, and the time of my
        departure has come.
004:007 I have fought the good fight.  I have finished the course.
        I have kept the faith.
004:008 From now on, there is stored up for me the crown of righteousness,
        which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give to me on
        that day; and not to me only, but also to all those who have
        loved his appearing.
004:009 Be diligent to come to me soon,
004:010 for Demas left me, having loved this present world, and went
        to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.
004:011 Only Luke is with me.  Take Mark, and bring him with you,
        for he is useful to me for service.
004:012 But I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.
004:013 Bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus when you come,
        and the books, especially the parchments.
004:014 Alexander, the coppersmith, did much evil to me.
        The Lord will repay him according to his works,
004:015 of whom you also must beware; for he greatly opposed our words.
004:016 At my first defense, no one came to help me, but all left me.
        May it not be held against them.
004:017 But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me, that through me
        the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles
        might hear; and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.
004:018 And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will
        preserve me for his heavenly Kingdom; to whom be the glory
        forever and ever.  Amen.
004:019 Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.
004:020 Erastus remained at Corinth, but I left Trophimus at Miletus sick.
004:021 Be diligent to come before winter.  Eubulus salutes you,
        as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers.
004:022 The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.  Grace be
        with you.  Amen.

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
