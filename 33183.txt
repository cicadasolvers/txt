"KODAK"


Is our registered and commonlaw trade mark and cannot be rightfully
applied except to goods of our manufacture. When a dealer tries to sell
you, under the Kodak name, a camera or films or other goods not of our
manufacture, you can be sure that he has an inferior article that he is
trying to market on the Kodak reputation, and he also makes himself
liable to suit by us for damages and injunction.

KODAK SERVICE


Make it simpler.

From the very inception the Kodak Idea has been--make photography so
simple that anybody can take good pictures.

Simpler cameras, simpler processes have followed each other with almost
startling rapidity. But the Kodak Company has not been satisfied with
merely making mechanical and chemical improvements; it has assumed the
responsibility of educating people in picture taking. The very first
Kodak, way back in 1888, was accompanied by a so-called "manual" that
did more than merely explain the operation of the mechanical features of
the camera. It showed how the pictures should be taken, _how_ (and how
not) to photograph a tall building, how to photograph a small
child--told about the length of exposures in different kinds of light,
both in-doors and out. It was really a primary hand-book of photography.

From that day on, every piece of Kodak apparatus, every amateur product
of the Company has been accompanied by the most concise instructions,
instructions that were also constructive because they not only told the
beginner what to do but _why he was to do it_. Even in the Kodak
advertising matter as much space is given up to telling people how to
make pictures as in telling them why they should buy Kodak goods.
Booklets in large editions, giving instructions in practically every
phase of amateur photography have been and still are distributed without
charge. Photography has not merely been made simpler, it has been
explained to all who are interested.


"Kodakery"--A Monthly Help

And now comes a new help to the beginner--"Kodakery," a little magazine
that will tell the amateur how to get better pictures. It's beautifully
illustrated. Written and edited by those who know photography inside and
out and who also know the places where the amateur has trouble, it will
be a joy and a help to every enthusiast, will add for thousands to the
Witchery of Kodakery.

Every purchaser, after May 1st, 1914, of a Kodak or Brownie camera will
be entitled to "Kodakery" for one year without charge--he may have it
continued by subscribing at 50 cents per year if he so desires. In the
back of each Kodak and Brownie manual, which we are now printing, is a
"subscription blank" which, upon being properly filled out and mailed
to--"Kodakery," Toronto, Ont.--will entitle the purchaser of such camera
to one year's free subscription to "Kodakery." At the time this plan
goes into operation there may still be some such manuals without a
subscription blank, but in such case a blank may be obtained from the
dealer of whom the camera was purchased. Every purchaser of a Kodak or
Brownie Camera is entitled to one copy of the manual or instruction book
and to one year's subscription to "Kodakery."

The editors of "Kodakery" aim first of all to make the little book a
real help. At the same time it will be interesting and its delightful
illustrations will show the beginner new possibilities in amateur
photography. This little magazine is but a part of the Kodak Service. To
sell a camera and then turn the customer adrift has never been a part of
the Kodak plan. Along with our improvements in apparatus and materials,
we have always endeavored also to improve the Kodak Service. "Kodakery"
will, we believe, prove the means of keeping us more closely than ever
in touch with our customers. In many ways it will be directly
helpful--and it will always suggest the propriety of the customer's
going to his Kodak dealer or to us, if there are little difficulties
(there are no big ones, now) to be overcome.

It is to be a real help--a part of the Kodak Idea--one more aid to the
beginner in the making of good pictures.

Kodak Ball Bearing Shutter

This shutter is automatic and as its leaves are mounted on ball bearings
it operates with remarkable smoothness and precision. The leaves open
and close in the form of a star, admitting a much larger amount of light
in the same space of time than the ordinary type of shutter. All but the
No. 0 work with bulb or finger release and have variable indicated
speeds of 1/25, 1/50 and 1/100 second as well as bulb and time
exposures.

[Illustration]

They are also fitted with indicator for registering each exposure as
made and iris diaphragm.

Supplied with Kodak Junior No. 1A, and Folding Pocket Kodaks, Nos. 1A,
R. R. Type; 3, 3A and 4. The No. 0 is supplied with the Vest Pocket
Kodak and Vest Pocket Kodak Special, and is similar to the above
excepting that it works with finger release only, has variable speeds of
1/25 and 1/50 second, and is regularly equipped with the Kodak Autotime
Scale. The No. 0 is also supplied with the Kodak Junior No. 1, but in
this instance is not fitted with autotime scale.


Pocket Automatic Shutter

This shutter has star shaped opening and is automatic in action. It
works with finger release for bulb, time and instantaneous exposures and
is perfectly reliable in every respect. Fitted with iris diaphragm stops
and regularly supplied with Nos. 1 and 1A Folding Pocket Kodaks, and
Nos. 2 and 2A Folding Pocket Brownies.

[Illustration]


Brownie Ball Bearing Shutter

The ball bearing type of shutter has been found so accurate and reliable
that we have designed a shutter on the ball bearing principle for the 3
and 3A Folding Brownie cameras.

This shutter is well made in every respect, it works with bulb and tube
or finger release, and is fitted with the Kodak Autotime Scale--a great
help for amateur photographers, especially beginners.

[Illustration]

The Brownie Ball Bearing shutter works not only for time and bulb
exposures, but has variable indicated speeds of 1/25, 1/50 and 1/100
second. It is fitted with iris diaphragm and supplied with the Nos. 3
and 3A Folding Brownie cameras.

For a more complete description of the Kodak Autotime Scale supplied
with this shutter, see page 8.


Compound Shutter

The Compound shutter is an automatic and setting shutter combined.
Automatically, either time or bulb exposures may be made, while it may
be set for speeds of from 1 to 1/150, 1/200 and 1/250 second, according
to size of shutter. The shutter leaves are formed of segments opening in
star shape, giving even illumination over the entire plate the instant
the exposure is started, and an iris diaphragm is supplied for stopping
down.

[Illustration]

Case is made of aluminum, and accurate adjustments can be made with the
shutter in any position.

Regularly supplied on the Nos. 1A, 3, 3A Special and _Six-Three_ Kodaks
and as a special equipment with the Nos. 4 and 4A Folding Kodaks.


Kodak Automatic Shutter and Kodak Autotime Scale

The Kodak Automatic shutter is carefully adjusted for time, bulb and
instantaneous exposures. It is also graduated for fractional parts of a
second, and is unusually accurate.

[Illustration]

This shutter is fitted with the Kodak Autotime scale and is supplied as
a special equipment on the Nos. 1A, R. R. Type; 3, 3A and 4 Folding
Pocket Kodaks.

The Scale greatly reduces the liability of error in exposure, as it
automatically indicates the proper time and stop opening for subjects
under any condition of outdoor photography. It is exceedingly simple to
use. The speed indicator is merely set at the point on the scale
indicating the kind of light prevailing and the diaphragm indicator at
the point indicating the character of the subject.

These scales are also supplied at a nominal charge for the following
shutters when fitted with double lenses only, and can be readily
attached by any amateur. Always order by Style letter.

Kodak Lenses

The regular R. R. and meniscus lenses used on Kodak and Brownie Cameras
have always been the best lenses of their respective types that could be
secured. These lenses are perfectly adapted to everyday amateur
photography, producing pictures under normal light conditions that leave
nothing to be desired by the average amateur.

For those, however, who wish even greater efficiency and capabilities,
we supply the anastigmat lens equipments.

The superiority of the anastigmat lens, without attempting to go into
the technicalities of the subject, consists of--Perfect definition over
the whole negative, absolute flatness of field, and higher speed.

In R. R. lenses the tendency to lack of definition toward the edges,
which always occurs in an uncorrected lens, is so slight as to be
unnoticeable except to the most expert eye. In a true anastigmat, it is
entirely eliminated.

The speed of a lens is determined by the relative size of the diaphragm
opening. An R. R. lens cannot be used at an opening greater than 1/8 its
focal length, commonly designated as _f._ 8. But an anastigmat lens can
be so corrected as to permit the use of larger diaphragm openings and
still produce sharp, clear negatives. This larger opening admits more
light within a given time than that of the R. R. lens, hence the
anastigmat is much faster. Thus the Zeiss or Cooke Kodak Anastigmat
lens, working at an aperture of _f._ 6.3 admits 60 per cent. more light
in a given time than does the R. R.

This speed advantage enables the user to make short exposures on dull
days or under poor light conditions, where hopelessly undertimed
negatives would result with an R. R. lens. And under proper conditions,
exposures up to 1/250 second with a Compound shutter and 1/1000 with a
focal plane shutter, can be made with the anastigmat.

In the last few years there has been a steadily increasing interest in
and demand for anastigmat lens equipments among amateur photographers,
and we responded to this demand, first by furnishing the Special Kodaks
fitted with Zeiss Kodak Anastigmat lens, _f._ 6.3--a lens fully
corrected and offering the advantage of high speed.

These have been followed by the _Six-Three_ Kodaks. These differ from
the Specials in that they are simply our regular Kodak models, without
the special covering and finish of "Specials," and fitted with
anastigmat lenses specially designed by Taylor, Taylor & Hobson, for
Kodak use and called the Cooke Kodak Anastigmat. This lens works at _f._
6.3 and is fully corrected in every particular.


Vest Pocket Kodak

The extraordinary popularity of the Vest Pocket Kodak is due not alone
to its compactness--it is so flat and smooth and small that it will
readily slip into a vest pocket--but also to the excellent quality of
its pictures, whether printed by contact or enlarged.

In fact, this little camera in itself is so very desirable and of such
general utility, that we furnish it with several different equipments to
meet any demand.

For average photography, the camera fitted with Kodak Ball Bearing
shutter and tested meniscus achromatic lens is amply efficient, for it
will make excellent pictures under ordinary conditions.

For those who want the microscopic definition of the anastigmat, we
offer the Vest Pocket Kodak, this year, fitted with the new Kodak
Anastigmat lens. This lens works at _f._ 8, it is fully corrected, and
made of the first quality of Jena glass. This makes a most desirable
outfit at a surprisingly low price for an anastigmat equipment.

Then for those who want not only the absolute sharpness and flatness of
field, but the maximum of speed as well, we offer the camera fitted with
Zeiss Kodak Anastigmat lens, _f._ 6.9.

[Illustration]

The appearance of the Vest Pocket Kodak is so suggestive of quality,
that it makes an ideal camera for gift purposes on holidays, birthdays,
at graduation time, and such occasions. For these purposes we have
devised the Kodak Gift Case shown in the illustration. The Vest Pocket
Kodak in this case is fitted with Kodak Anastigmat lens, _f._ 8. The
carrying case is of imported satin finish leather, in a shade of soft
brown that is in perfect harmony with the deep blue of the handsome
silk-lined container. The whole outfit possesses a quality and richness
that will appeal to the most fastidious.

The Vest Pocket Kodak with any equipment is always ready for action. It
is only necessary to pull out the front to its full extent, and the
camera is in focus for objects at any distance. The shutter is
automatic, and a convenient reversible finder, for composing the view in
either horizontal or vertical position, is provided.

[Illustration]

Another feature is the extreme simplicity in loading--nothing trappy or
fussy about it. Indeed, the operation of the camera is simple in every
detail, nothing in the way of simplicity or efficiency having been
sacrificed in order to reduce the size.

No. 1 Kodak Junior

So complete and varied has the Kodak line become, so altogether simple
is the operation of each camera, that each year it looks well nigh
impossible to strengthen the line or broaden the selection for the
amateur.

[Illustration]

However, the Kodak policy of never letting well enough alone has
developed two most attractive new models this year, which round off the
whole line, being built upon the idea of providing genuine
daylight-all-the-way Kodaks, with all the Kodak convenience and
dependability, for those who wish to take up photography at the minimum
of expense.

The first of these models, the No. 1 Kodak Junior, makes 2-1/4 x 3-1/4
pictures and loads with the Kodak Film cartridge of six exposures (No.
120). And for loading and unloading, the back of the camera is
constructed upon a new principle which makes it unusually easy to
remove.

A striking feature of this camera is its extreme thinness and all-around
compactness. It will readily slip into the pocket, and yet it is fully
equipped for efficient work in all branches of general amateur
photography. It is fitted with the No. 0 Ball Bearing shutter, speed
1/50 of a second, with cable release, as described on page 6, and offers
the choice of rapid rectilinear or meniscus achromatic lens. All lenses
fitted to this camera must stand the usual rigid Kodak tests.

The No. 1 Kodak Junior is provided with automatic focusing lock,
collapsible reversible finder, two tripod sockets--in fact, the
practical, convenient working equipment which one expects in a true
Kodak.

The camera is well made in every respect, it is covered with a good
quality of grain leather, and the metal parts are finished in nickel and
black enamel.

The low price means no stinting in either material or workmanship. It is
only possible through the perfection of our scientific factory
organization and the large quantities which our large distribution
enables us to make at one time.

for No. 2 Brownie and not for No. 1 Folding Pocket Kodak.

The Price

    fitted with R. R. lens only)                                  1.00
  N. C. Film Cartridge, 6 exposures (No. 120)                      .20
  Kodak Portrait Attachment                                        .50


No. 1A Kodak Junior

In this new model is offered the advantages of low cost, with Kodak
efficiency, which we have seen in the No. 1 Kodak Junior, in a camera
made upon the same principle for 2-1/2 x 4-1/4 pictures.

[Illustration]

This is one of the most popular amateur sizes, the proportion being
unusually pleasing for landscapes, street scenes, and the like, in the
horizontal position, and admirably adapted for portraiture when used
vertically.

With its strikingly thin, compact form, its reliable equipment and its
low cost, the No. 1A Kodak Junior is sure to please anyone who prefers
pictures of this size.

This model will accommodate the regular twelve exposure Kodak N. C. Film
cartridges, and thus offers the daylight-all-the-way feature of all
Kodaks.

The shutter is the Kodak Ball Bearing with cable release, which works
not only for bulb and time exposures, but has variable indicated speeds
of 1/25, 1/50 and 1/100 second. The leaves, opening in the shape of a
star, admit the greatest possible amount of light, for a
between-the-lens shutter, at each exposure.

The camera is furnished with either meniscus achromatic or rapid
rectilinear lens. In both cases the lens is carefully tested and must
conform to the high Kodak standard before it is allowed to go on the
camera.

Simplicity marks this camera in every respect. It is made with the new
style back--unusually easy to remove for loading and unloading. It has
an automatic focusing lock, which permits the camera to be brought to
focus quickly for objects at any distance. The finder is of the new
collapsible type; it is reversible, and two tripod sockets are
furnished, so that the camera may be easily used in either the vertical
or horizontal position.

So compact that it will readily slip into the pocket, this camera offers
that high standard of efficiency which is inseparable from the Kodak
idea. The back and bed are made of aluminum, the covering is genuine
leather, and metal parts are finished in nickel and black enamel.

Nos. 1 and 1A Folding Pocket Kodaks

[Illustration]

These little Kodaks are designed for those who wish compact folding
cameras which can be easily carried in the pocket and which will make
pictures without the necessity of focusing or estimating distances.

Upon opening the camera the front springs automatically into position,
ready at once for making pictures of objects at any distance. A
reversible finder makes composition easy, and slight pressure of the
shutter lever makes the exposure.

When closed the bed folds over front and bellows, concealing all
adjustments, and the camera can then be very conveniently carried in any
coat pocket. The camera is made of aluminum, with best seal grain
leather covering and has nickel fittings. They differ only in the size
of the pictures they make.

No. 1A Folding-Pocket Kodak--R. R. Type

[Illustration]

This is a camera of greater capabilities and wider scope than those
previously described--the first of that series of double lens Kodaks
which have played such a prominent part in the development and
popularization of amateur photography.

These cameras are fitted with the best R. R. lenses to be had, each one
carefully tested to the highest standard and fitted only if it conforms
to that standard. The shutter is of the Kodak Ball Bearing type.

The camera as a whole makes a compact, inexpensive outfit, considering
its capabilities, and one which, though suitable for the most serious
work, will slip readily into the pocket, and is so simple that it may be
effectively handled by the beginner.

Nos. 3 and 4 Folding Pocket Kodaks

These cameras are made for two standard amateur size pictures and are
similar in every essential respect excepting in the matter of size. The
No. 3 makes 3-1/4 x 4-1/4 pictures--a favorite with many, and especially
suitable for lantern slide making, as the slide can be printed by direct
contact. The No. 4 makes 4 x 5 pictures and is preferred by many on
account of the comparatively large size which it is possible to get of
the objects in the composition.

[Illustration]

Both cameras offer the usual Kodak simplicity, and the exceptional lens
and shutter equipment which assures the user the maximum of efficiency
in all work where an anastigmat equipment is not necessary. The
illustration on the opposite page shows the No. 3.

The shutter is the Kodak Ball Bearing, in which is mounted an R. R. lens
which must stand the most rigid test before it is passed by our
inspectors. This lens works at _f._ 8, and as the leaves of the Kodak
Ball Bearing shutter open in the shape of a star, the greatest possible
amount of light is admitted at this opening--a fact which makes the
instruments especially valuable for snap-shot work.

The cameras are equipped with rising and sliding front--a great
convenience in architectural and many forms of landscape photography,
and an automatic focusing lock is provided so that either can quickly be
brought to focus at any-distance.

While these models, of course, are designed for the use of our roll
films, either can be loaded with plates at any time by the addition of a
simple plate adapter or combination back (supplied extra). This is
interchangeable with the regular back, is provided with ground glass for
focusing and takes double plate holders. (See similar back illustrated
on page 20.)

Both cameras are handsomely finished throughout. Back and bed are of
aluminum, metal parts are highly nickeled, and covering is of fine
quality grain leather.

No. 3A Folding Pocket Kodak

The best thought of our manufacturing organization has been put into
presenting in this model a moderate priced camera for general amateur
photography that is the embodiment of skill and painstaking care.

[Illustration]

It has in fact come to be recognized as the standard in hand cameras,
and every suitable improvement made, or new idea evolved in the years in
which it has been on the market, has been incorporated in its
construction.

The 3A Folding Pocket Kodak was the first camera made for 3-1/4 x 5-1/2
pictures--a size which has become the most popular of all amateur sizes.
Its proportions are just right for post cards, it is unusually effective
for landscapes and street scenes when used horizontally; while
vertically, it is ideal for portraiture, whether full length or head and
shoulders, when the camera is fitted with Kodak Portrait Attachment.

The camera is fitted with tested R. R. lens, the Kodak Ball Bearing
shutter, and rising and sliding front. And it is so simple that a
beginner can make good pictures with it from the start.

[Illustration: Showing Combination Back with Focusing Screen]

Like the No. 3, this model will accommodate plates as well as films by
the simple addition of a combination back, which is interchangeable with
the regular back. This may be secured from any dealer, it is fitted with
ground glass and takes double plate holders.

This camera is covered with best quality of fine grain leather, and has
nickeled fittings.

No. 4A Folding Kodak

For very large size pictures, we offer the No. 4A Folding Kodak--a
camera which combines all the simple and convenient Kodak features in a
very light and compact camera, considering the size of the pictures it
makes. It is fully equipped for out-of-the-ordinary work, as well as for
snap-shot and general amateur photography.

[Illustration]

One of its special features is its adaptability to home portraiture.
Fitted with the Kodak Portrait Attachment, it will make bust portraits
up to the full size of the film, as it may be operated as close as 3-1/2
feet to the subject. A plate adapter (extra) with focusing screen,
interchangeable with the regular back, will permit the use of dry plates
if desired.

The shutter supplied with this model is a double valve automatic, which
works not only for time and bulb exposures, but is also graduated in
fractional parts of a second from 1/100 to 1. The lens is a Rapid
Rectilinear of the same high quality as those supplied with the
preceding Kodaks.

The camera is equipped with rising and sliding front, rack and pinion
for easy focusing, two tripod sockets and a very positive automatic
standard clamp. The regular finder is a brilliant reversible, but when
desired, a direct view finder can be furnished for specially quick
snap-shot work with the camera held on a level with the eyes.

Constructed with the same care and attention to detail as the preceding
model, the No. 4A is just as simple to operate, and is finished in the
same style, with seal grain covering and nickeled fittings.

Panoram Kodaks

The Panoram Kodak does a special kind of work--a very desirable kind of
work which cannot be done with a camera of any other type.

As its name implies, it is constructed so as to take panoramic pictures
of outdoor groups, landscapes, mountain views, and the like.

For instance, in making a picture of an outdoor group of twelve or
fifteen people, with an ordinary camera, they would have to be arranged
in two or three rows to get good sized images, but with a Panoram they
can be arranged in a semi-circle, at a given distance from the camera,
and all appear in the picture in one row and of the proper relative
size. Again, in making a landscape, the sweep of the Panoram lens will
take in the complete view, while the scope of the ordinary camera could
only permit a portion of it to be taken at one exposure.

In addition to its use for making horizontal pictures, the camera may be
as easily used in the vertical position, and decidedly unique pictures
of high waterfalls, mountain peaks and such subjects can be secured.

The lens is mounted on a pivot and when the exposure is to be made, by
pressing a lever the lens automatically swings on this pivot from one
side of the camera to the other, embracing an angle of over 100 degrees.
At the same time, the shutter operates automatically with great
precision, insuring even illumination throughout the exposure.

There is no complication whatever in operation, the whole process is
automatic; it's just as easy to make pictures with the Panoram as with
any other Kodak.

Those who already have other Kodaks or contemplate purchasing such, will
find this a valuable addition to their photographic equipment for the
making of out-of-the-ordinary pictures.

Panoram Kodaks use the regular daylight loading N. C. Kodak film, they
are carefully made, have genuine leather coverings and nickeled
fittings.

The No. 1 has a scope of 112 degrees, while the No. 4 embraces an angle
of 142 degrees. Panoram Kodaks cannot be used successfully indoors.

Nos. 1A and 3 Special Kodaks

The Special Kodaks are made upon the idea of providing the very best
possible in hand cameras. A fine anastigmat lens, made expressly for
hand camera work, a high speed, accurate shutter, a complete operating
equipment, and the best materials procurable, richly finished--these,
moulded together by the most expert camera workmen in the world, leave
nothing to be desired by the user, whether he be beginner or expert.

[Illustration]

Aside from the requirements of the focal plane specialist, there is no
condition under which amateur pictures can be made, in which these
cameras will not produce the best possible results.

The Nos. 1A and 3 Specials are alike in every respect excepting in
size--the No. 1A making 2-1/2 x 4-1/4 pictures and the No. 3 the larger
3-1/4 x 4-1/4 size.

Each is fitted with the Zeiss Kodak Anastigmat lens working at a maximum
opening of _f._ 6.3, and with the Compound shutter attaining a speed of
1/250 second. The fast lenses give the Specials a great advantage over
the ordinary camera in dull lights, and in combination with the Compound
shutter, make them second only to cameras having focal plane shutters
for photographing rapidly moving objects.

They have rising and sliding fronts, reversible finders, rack and pinion
for focusing, spirit levels, in fact every useful convenience that can
be put into a hand camera. The No. 3 size will take plates by addition
of a combination back (supplied extra).

Made as the last word in photographic perfection, these cameras are
beautifully finished. Covered with genuine Persian Morocco, with rich
black leather bellows and nickeled fittings, they bear the impress of
the quality that is in them.

No. 3A Special Kodak

To combine in one instrument every feature that could add to practical
efficiency and yet retain the pocket Kodak convenience and simplicity
was the work that we set for ourselves in designing the 3A Special
Kodak. In no respect did we fall short of that work. In this camera no
essential to good picture making is omitted, yet it has no unnecessary
"contraptions" to annoy and befog the beginner. It is recognized as the
highest type of hand camera for the amateur--skilled or unskilled.

[Illustration]

The 3A Special Kodak is equipped with the Zeiss Kodak Anastigmat lens,
_f._ 6.3, the anastigmat made especially for hand camera work and
combining speed, depth and definition in an unusual degree. The shutter
is the Compound, operated by either cable or finger release and having a
maximum speed of 1/200 second.

With this equipment it is possible to get well-timed pictures, under
light conditions that would be fatal to good results with the ordinary
camera and in bright light to make successful exposures as short as
1/200 second.

The 3A Special has a most complete equipment in keeping with the high
grade of work for which it is designed. It has both rising and sliding
front, reversible finder, rack and pinion for focusing, spirit level,
double focusing scale--one for films and the other for plates.

The camera body is made of aluminum, producing a very light, yet strong
and durable, instrument. The finish and appointments are of the richest.
The covering is genuine Persian Morocco, the bellows is of black
selected leather, and these in connection with the highly nickeled
fittings and dull black enameled shutter add that look of quality that
is in harmony with its genuine efficiency and worth.

_Six-Three_ Kodaks

[Illustration]

From the time that the Kodak catalogue appeared last year, containing
the first announcement of the _Six-Three_ Kodaks, it was evident that
these cameras were to score a great success. The demand for them grew,
as it were, over night, and has steadily kept up ever since.

This is a natural enough condition, when it is considered that
_Six-Three_ Kodaks provide those who want the anastigmat advantages of
definition, flatness of field, and speed, at the minimum of expense,
with suitably equipped and fully reliable cameras.

To produce such cameras we have taken the regular Folding Pocket Kodak
models and replaced the R. R. lens and Ball Bearing shutter equipments
with the Compound shutter with cable release and the Cooke Kodak
anastigmat lens. This lens is an anastigmat of first quality, fully
corrected and working at a maximum speed of _f._ 6.3.

For other details on any _Six-Three_ Kodak, merely refer to the detailed
specifications of the corresponding regular model.

No. 1 Brownie

[Illustration]

This, the first of the Brownies, is really responsible for the entire
line of these popular cameras. Originally produced as a camera
particularly for the children, the No. 1 Brownie made such good pictures
in their hands as to excite the interest of grown-up people, and the
success obtained by its use created a demand for similar inexpensive
cameras for pictures of larger size. The No. 1 Brownie is exceedingly
simple to operate and each camera has to undergo the regular Kodak
inspection, before being sent out.

The scope of view is ordinarily located by V-shaped lines at the top,
but if preferred the Brownie finder (detachable) illustrated below, can
be fitted at an extra charge of 25 cents.

Has automatic shutter for time or snap-shot exposures, and will make
good portraits when fitted with Kodak Portrait Attachment.

people all over the world, who are making perfectly satisfactory

No. 3 Brownie

[Illustration]

For those who want larger pictures, the No. 3 Brownie offers the same
simplicity, the same reliability and the same proportionately low cost,
in a camera for 3-1/4 x 4-1/4 pictures, as do the smaller Brownies.

This camera is capable of producing excellent pictures in the hands of
the young or the old, and its negatives are of such quality as to yield
very good enlargements by use of the inexpensive Brownie Enlarging
Camera. In fact, this is a feature of all Brownies.

By the addition of a Kodak Portrait Attachment this instrument can be
used with excellent success in home portraiture.

The No. 3 Brownie is well made in every respect. It has durable
imitation leather covering, metal parts are nickeled and it offers the
daylight-all-the-way feature of the Kodaks.

No. 2 Folding Pocket Brownie

[Illustration]

The folding Brownies are made upon the same idea of simplicity and low
cost as the box forms. They are so closely related to the
Kodaks--offering, as they do, the daylight-all-the-way feature and made
in the Kodak factories, by Kodak workmen--that they well deserve the
name "little cousins of the Kodaks."

The No. 2 is a very dainty little camera which will slip readily into an
ordinary pocket, and make excellent pictures the all-by-daylight-way. It
is fitted with our Pocket Automatic shutter working for time, bulb and
snap-shot exposures, in which is mounted an excellent meniscus lens.
Fitted with Kodak Portrait Attachment, this becomes a good camera for
home portraiture, and the negatives which it makes will yield excellent
5 x 7 enlargements by use of the Brownie Enlarging Camera.

The camera is carefully finished throughout, it has imitation leather
covering and nickeled fittings.

No. 2A Folding Pocket Brownie

[Illustration]

The pleasing proportions of the pictures taken by this little Brownie,
combined with its simple operation and reliability, have made it one of
the most popular cameras of the whole Brownie line.

For effective landscape composition and full and three-quarter length
portraits, the shape of its pictures is ideal. And when fitted with
Kodak Portrait Attachment, it may be operated close up to the subject
for bust portraits.

Identical in construction and general design with the No. 2, this model
can as easily be carried in the pocket, works for time, bulb and
instantaneous exposures, and is well finished throughout. Attractively

No. 3 Folding Brownie

[Illustration]

Always an efficient camera, the capabilities of the No. 3 Folding
Brownie have been still further increased by the addition of the Brownie
Ball Bearing shutter. This shutter, made upon the same principle as the
Kodak Ball Bearing, with its star-shaped opening and smooth, accurate
action, makes the camera especially effective for snap-shot work.

No. 3 Folding Brownies are well made, dependable cameras in every
respect, they have the simplicity and daylight-all-the-way feature of
their big cousins, the Kodaks, and offer the choice of either double or
single lens equipment. Illustration shows camera with single lens.

[Illustration]

Like the No. 3, the efficiency of this model has been greatly augmented
by addition of the Brownie Ball Bearing shutter.

It offers the choice of either single or double lens, and working with
the usual Brownie simplicity, it makes a highly effective camera, for
the popular 3-1/4 x 5-1/2 pictures, at low cost.

This camera will produce extremely good results in general amateur
photography, under ordinarily favorable conditions, and when fitted with
Kodak Portrait Attachment, becomes a most dependable outfit for home
portraiture. It is covered with durable imitation leather, has nickeled

Brownie Enlarging Camera

The average amateur usually thinks of enlarging as an intricate,
expensive process, requiring considerable skill and experience. But such
is not the fact. Even a youngster can make first-rate enlargements with
a Brownie Enlarging Camera. It's just as easy as printing on Velox
paper. In fact the two processes are very much the same, excepting that
in printing, the negative and paper are in close contact, while in
enlarging, the paper is at some distance from the negative, with a lens
in between.

[Illustration]

As shown in the illustration, the Brownie Enlarging Camera is simplicity
itself. It's just a light-tight cone with an attachment at the small end
to hold the negative, and another at the large end for the paper.
Provision is made inside for holding the lens.

To make an enlargement, one merely places the negative and paper in
place, holds the negative end up to the light for a specified time and
then develops the paper as usual.

One of these inexpensive outfits will enable you to make enlargements at
any time from your favorite negatives.

The cameras are collapsible, so that they fold flat and may be
conveniently carried in a suit case.

V. P. Kodak Enlarging Camera

This is made upon exactly the same principle as the Brownie Enlarging
Camera, excepting that being small in itself, it is not made
collapsible.

It offers the simplest means for making 3-1/4 x 5-1/2 enlargements from
1-5/8 x 2-1/2 negatives.

Brownie Enlarging Camera Illuminator

[Illustration]

In enlarging with the Brownie or Vest Pocket Kodak Enlarging Camera, the
exposure may be made by daylight, but to accommodate those who wish to
do their enlarging at night or who prefer to use artificial light at all
times we have devised the Brownie Enlarging Camera Illuminator, which
assures the user a uniformly strong, even light, day or night. It is
simply constructed, and moderate in price.

The illuminator is collapsible, but when set up, has the form of a
half-round, light-proof box with socket through which is inserted an
electric light bulb.

The inner walls of this box are white and act as a reflector when the
light is turned on. At the end is a ground glass, which diffuses the
light, so that by placing negative end of the enlarging camera in
contact with this glass and turning on the electricity, an excellent
steady printing light is obtained.

The glass is provided with a hinged protector of ruby cloth, which may
be closed as soon as the exposure is completed, and the illuminator then
becomes a perfect lamp for the developing and subsequent operations with
the enlargement. Complete instructions for use are included with each
outfit, and anyone who has electric light in the house will find it
invaluable for enlarging purposes.

  Brownie Enlarging Camera Illuminator,    $3.50.


The Kodiopticon

[Illustration]

The Kodiopticon opens a new use--a new pleasure in his negatives, for
the amateur photographer. For it enables anyone who has electricity in
his house, to show sharp, well-illuminated lantern slide projections
without difficulty and at small expense.

The Kodiopticon is substantially made, and operated with an ordinary
Mazda electric lamp, at a distance of 10 feet from the sheet, will
project images of about 36 inches. A larger image may be secured by
setting the Kodiopticon a greater distance away, but the greater the
distance the less the illumination. Can also be furnished with an
electric arc lamp, when it can be used at 12 feet, with the maximum
illumination, projecting an image of about 42 inches.

The Kodiopticon has a water jacket for protection of the slides from
heat, and the price includes a strong wooden case, which, by reversing
the top, serves as a permanent stand for the outfit.

Velox Transparent Water Color Stamps

[Illustration]

An interesting and highly enjoyable diversion for the amateur
photographer is the coloring of prints. And those who use the
Kodiopticon will find that many slides are greatly improved by the
addition of color. While actual color photography is by no means
practical for general amateur use, anyone can make beautifully colored
prints by the use of Velox Transparent Water Color Stamps.

No special artistic skill, no knowledge of painting whatever is
necessary. Just a brush or two and the book of stamps, which includes
simple directions for coloring both prints and lantern slides.

Each book includes twelve sheets of colors and each sheet is divided by
perforations into twenty-two stamps. To use any color merely tear off a
stamp, place in a small saucer or palette supplied with the outfit, and
cover with about a teaspoonful of water.

The Velox Transparent Water Color Stamp Outfit offers the greatest
convenience in coloring prints, as it includes the book of stamps, three
brushes and a white enameled mixing palette, put up in a neat cardboard
case.

Kodak Film Tank

[Illustration]

Development, that former bugbear of the amateur photographer and
especially of the beginner, is made a simple proposition by the Kodak
Film Tank--fully as simple as any part of the photographic process.

The Kodak Film Tank automatically develops every roll of film put into
it, just as well as that roll of film could be developed by the most
experienced photographer. If directions are followed, if the chemicals
are mixed and the temperature regulated according to instructions, a boy
or girl can get just as good results from the Kodak Film Tank as an
expert by any method.

In other words, every roll of film put into the film tank, where the
simple directions are implicitly followed, will come out developed as
well, or better, than that roll of film could be developed in the dark
room by the most experienced photographer. And it is very simple, it
eliminates the dark room entirely, developing the film in broad
daylight, and is so compact as to be easily carried and used anywhere.

The Kodak Film Tank consists of a winding box, a light-proof apron, and
a heavily nickeled brass solution cup with cover. In the Brownie Film
Tank, however, no cover is necessary as the film roll itself is turned.
All articles can be packed in the box, making the entire outfit
self-contained.

The film to be developed is placed upon a reel in the winding box, the
cover is placed on the box and the film is wound around an axis in
combination with the apron, in such fashion that, when completely wound,
the apron protects the film effectually from light, and may be removed
from the winding box safely at any time. It is then lowered into the cup
of developer, the cover attached and the film left to develop for twenty
minutes. After development the film is removed for fixing.

Every step is performed in daylight and the exact time necessary for
development, in combination with the chemical formula, has been
scientifically worked out, so that all differences of exposure within
reasonable bounds are taken care of. Especial attention is called to the
new 2-1/2-inch size, for the development of 1A or 2A films.

Those who wish to develop more than one roll at a time can do so without
purchasing extra tanks complete, by securing duplicating outfits as
listed below.

No. 2 Brownie Developing Box

[Illustration]

Offering the same assurance of perfectly developed film as the Kodak
Film Tank, the Brownie Developing Box is a modified form of the same, so
simple to use that any boy or girl can readily understand and operate
it.

It consists of a metal box with cover, just long enough to accommodate a
roll of No. 1 or No. 2 Brownie Film in one loop.

To develop, the roll of film is inserted in the spool carrier, and by
means of a cord and winding shaft the film is unrolled and carried
around a roller bearing, thus exposing the film to the action of the
developer.

Before unrolling the film the developer is poured in the box and the
cover put in place; all these operations being performed in daylight.
The film is then unrolled by turning the crank, when the box is rocked
on its standard for six minutes. The developer is then poured off and
box filled with water to wash out developer, after which film is removed
and fixed in daylight.

This is an excellent means, for those who have No. 1 or No. 2 Brownie
Cameras, of developing their films without the need of skill or
experience.

The Price

  No. 2 Brownie Developing Box                        $1.00
  Brownie Developing Box Powders, per package of 6      .15
  Kodak Acid Fixing Powders, 1/2-pound package          .15
  Ditto, 1/4-pound package                              .10


Eastman Plate Tank

[Illustration]

What the film tank has done for films, the plate tank does for plates.
The idea of the two tanks is based upon the same time and temperature
system of development, with, of course, such differences in actual
construction of the tanks as are required by the physical differences
between films and plates. And as plates must be unloaded in a dark room,
the plate tank cannot offer the advantage of daylight quite all the way,
but it takes only a few moments in the dark room to load this tank,
after which it may be brought out into any light for development.

The device consists of a metal solution cup with cover, a cage for
holding 12 or less plates, and a loading fixture for loading the plates
in the cage.

The exposed plates are loaded into the cage and placed in the tank,
which has been filled with developer, in the dark room and the tank
cover fastened in place. On the front of the tank is a dial for
registering time. Development is allowed to continue for fifteen
minutes, the tank being reversed several times. After development the
developer is washed out of the plates, and the fixing bath poured into
the tank, after which the plates are ready for washing in the usual
manner.

The Price

  Eastman Plate Tank, for 4 x 5, 3-1/4 x 5-1/2, and smaller
    plates, includes solution cup, plate cage, loading fixture
    and adjustable kit                                           $3.50

Kodak Portrait Attachment

There is no greater pleasure in photography than Home Portraiture, and
this little attachment, fitted to a Kodak or Brownie Camera, will enable
one to work up close to the subject and thereby secure bust portraits of
excellent quality limited in size, with the focusing Kodaks, only by the
dimensions of the film. The attachments are simply extra lenses, which
slip on in front of the regular lens, and they in no way affect the
operation of the instrument, excepting to make the lens cut sharp at
short distances.

[Illustration]

These attachments are not only serviceable for portraiture but also for
photographing any small object, such as flowers, fruits, still life
composition, at close range. Please order by number, or if required for
older models or cameras with special equipments specify shutter and size
of camera.

Velox Paper

Velox is the very best paper for amateur use for it is simple to use,
thoroughly dependable and is made in a variety of grades and surfaces to
fit all sorts of amateur negatives.

It prints in any light, requires no dark room and permits the amateur to
utilize his evening hours in print making. Its simplicity of
manipulation and extreme gradation make it suitable for photographic
work of every kind.

Velox is divided broadly into two kinds of paper called "Regular" and
"Special" (hard and soft) each division containing a variety of
surfaces. "Regular" papers develop quickly and are best suited for
negatives lacking contrast. "Special" papers develop slowly, and give
soft effects from hard negatives. Use "Special" Velox for negatives
producing good results on "Printing Out" paper (such as Solio), and
"Regular" only with very flat negatives (negatives lacking contrast).

Velox surfaces: In the "Regular" class are carbon (matte surface),
Glossy, Glossy double weight, Velvet, and Velvet double weight.
"Regular" Velvet Velox is semi-gloss and gives prints of exceptional
beauty. This paper will give satisfactory results from very flat
negatives.

In the "Special" class, the surfaces are Carbon (matte surface),
Portrait (smooth matte), Portrait double weight, Rough, Glossy, Glossy
double weight, Velvet, and Velvet double weight.

"Special" Velvet Velox has a greater range than any of the other
"Special" papers.

Royal Velox is coated on a soft, mellow-tinted stock, which when
re-developed affords all the soft delicacy of a rare old etching. It is
made in two grades, "Regular" and "Special" and one surface, just rough
enough to produce the desired effect.

Kodak Velvet Green

Effects heretofore to be had only by the laborious carbon process can
now be secured by any amateur photographer with this new paper.

For landscapes, for marines, and in fact, for the majority of outdoor
amateur negatives, the rich green of prints on Kodak Velvet Green
produces most beautiful harmonious effects, with an indescribable
"atmosphere" of nature itself.

And to use this paper the amateur has to learn no new processes nor
possess extraordinary skill. Anyone who can print on Velox paper can
print just as successfully on Kodak Velvet Green, as the two processes
after exposure are identical, and the developing solution is only
slightly changed.

The surface--a smooth semi-matte--brings out detail fully, and the paper
is supplied in both single and double weights.

Kodak Velvet Green Post-cards are very appropriate for use at vacation
time.

Prices same as for Velox. (See page 53.)

Flash-Light Material

The simplest and safest method of making flash-light pictures is by
means of the Eastman Flash Sheets and Kodak Flash Sheet Holder. The
sheets burn slowly, giving a broad, soft light, and not so startling the
subject as to give a staring effect to the eyes.

[Illustration]

The holder is a genuine innovation. A saw tooth holds the sheet in
proper position and it is lighted from the back through an aperture
provided in the centre for the purpose. In this manner the holder is
always between the operator and the flash sheet, and it may be held in
the hand or supported on a tripod, a socket being provided for the
latter purpose.

  No. 1 Flash Sheets, per package of 1/2 dozen sheets, 3 x 4     $0.25
  No. 2 Flash Sheets, per package of 1/2 dozen sheets, 4 x 5       .40

Kodak Magnesium Ribbon Holder

This extremely handy little apparatus provides a most convenient method
of burning magnesium ribbon for photographic purposes. It comprises at
once a compact magazine for storing the ribbon, a convenient holder
for burning it, and a ready means of measuring definite lengths.

[Illustration]

For printing on Velox and other gas light papers, lantern slides, etc.,
the ribbon is pushed forward by a movement of the thumb upon the edge of
the revolving disc until the desired length of ribbon projects from
holder.

Velox Lantern Slide Film

For use with the Kodiopticon or any other lantern slide projector that
has a water cell cooling device. With these films you can make lantern
slides by contact as easily as you can make Velox prints, the exposure,
development and printing being the same. For making slides by projection
they are as convenient as any plate.

After the slide is made, it is masked with Velox Lantern Slide Mats and
mounted in the Velox Lantern Slide Frame which has standard opening, and
eliminates the binding of the edges.

These slides are absolutely unbreakable.

Tested Chemicals

[Illustration]

Certainty in making negatives and prints depends as much on the quality
of your chemicals as on any other one thing. All Kodak chemicals are
tested both photographically and for purity before the C. K. C. tested
seal is allowed to go upon them. That seal is your protection.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
