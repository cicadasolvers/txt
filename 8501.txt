FOREWORD CONTAINING GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR ALL RECIPES


In this book, Philadelphia Ice Creams, comprising the first group, are
very palatable, but expensive. In many parts of the country it is quite
difficult to get good cream. For that reason, I have given a group of
creams, using part milk and part cream, but it must be remembered that
it takes smart "juggling" to make ice cream from milk. By far better use
condensed milk, with enough water or milk to rinse out the cans.

Ordinary fruit creams may be made with condensed milk at a cost of about
fifteen cents a quart, which, of course, is cheaper than ordinary milk and
cream.

In places where neither cream nor condensed milk can be purchased, a fair
ice cream is made by adding two tablespoonfuls of olive oil to each quart
of milk. The cream for Philadelphia Ice Cream should be rather rich, but
not double cream.

If pure raw cream is stirred rapidly, it swells and becomes frothy, like
the beaten whites of eggs, and is "whipped cream." To prevent this in
making Philadelphia Ice Cream, one-half the cream is scalded, and when it
is _very_ cold, the remaining half of raw cream is added. This gives the
smooth, light and rich consistency which makes these creams so different
from others.


USE OF FRUITS

Use fresh fruits in the summer and the best canned unsweetened fruits in
the winter. If sweetened fruits must be used, cut down the given quantity
of sugar. Where acid fruits are used, they should be added to the cream
after it is partly frozen.


TIME FOR FREEZING

The time for freezing varies according to the quality of cream or milk or
water; water ices require a longer time than ice creams. It is not well to
freeze the mixtures too rapidly; they are apt to be coarse, not smooth, and
if they are churned before the mixture is icy cold they will be greasy or
"buttery."

The average time for freezing two quarts of cream should be ten minutes; it
takes but a minute or two longer for larger quantities.


DIRECTIONS FOR FREEZING

Pound the ice in a large bag with a mallet, or use an ordinary ice shaver.
The finer the ice, the less time it takes to freeze the cream. A four quart
freezer will require ten pounds of ice, and a quart and a pint of coarse
rock salt. You may pack the freezer with a layer of ice three inches thick,
then a layer of salt one inch thick, or mix the ice and salt in the tub and
shovel it around the freezer. Before beginning to pack the freezer, turn
the crank to see that all the machinery is in working order. Then open the
can and turn in the mixture that is to be frozen. Turn the crank slowly and
steadily until the mixture begins to freeze, then more rapidly until it is
completely frozen. If the freezer is properly packed, it will take fifteen
minutes to freeze the mixture. Philadelphia Ice Creams are not good if
frozen too quickly.


TO REPACK

After the cream is frozen, wipe off the lid of the can and remove the
crank; take off the lid, being very careful not to allow any salt to fall
into the can. Remove the dasher and scrape it off. Take a large knife or
steel spatula, scrape the cream from the sides of the can, work and pack
it down until it is perfectly smooth. Put the lid back on the can, and put
a cork in the hole from which the dasher was taken. Draw off the water,
repack, and cover the whole with a piece of brown paper; throw over a heavy
bag or a bit of burlap, and stand aside for one or two hours to ripen.


TO MOLD ICE CREAMS, ICES OR PUDDINGS

If you wish to pack ice cream and serve it in forms or shapes, it must be
molded after the freezing. The handiest of all of these molds is either the
brick or the melon mold.

After the cream is frozen rather stiff, prepare a tub or bucket of coarsely
chopped ice, with one-half less salt than you use for freezing. To each ten
pounds of ice allow one quart of rock salt. Sprinkle a little rock salt in
the bottom of your bucket or tub, then put over a layer of cracked ice,
another layer of salt and cracked ice, and on this stand your mold, which
is not filled, but is covered with a lid, and pack it all around, leaving
the top, of course, to pack later on. Take your freezer near this tub.
Remove the lid from the mold, and pack in the cream, smoothing it down
until you have filled it to overflowing. Smooth the top with a spatula or
limber knife, put over a sheet of waxed paper and adjust the lid. Have a
strip of muslin or cheese cloth dipped in hot paraffin or suet and quickly
bind the seam of the lid. This will remove all danger of salt water
entering the pudding. Now cover the mold thoroughly with ice and salt.

Make sure that your packing tub or bucket has a hole below the top of the
mold, so that the salt water will be drained off.

If you are packing in small molds, each mold, as fast as it is closed,
should be wrapped in wax paper and put down into the salt and ice. These
must be filled quickly and packed.

Molds should stand two hours, and may stand longer.


TO REMOVE ICE CREAMS, ICES AND PUDDINGS FROM MOLDS

Ice cream may be molded in the freezer; you will then have a perfectly
round smooth mold, which serves very well for puddings that are to be
garnished, and saves a great deal of trouble and extra expense for salt and
ice.

As cold water is warmer than the ordinary freezing mixture, after you lift
the can or mold, wipe off the salt, hold it for a minute under the cold
water spigot, then quickly wipe the top and bottom and remove the lid.
Loosen the pudding with a limber knife, hold the mold a little slanting,
give it a shake, and nine times out of ten it will come out quickly, having
the perfect shape of the can or mold. If the cream still sticks and refuses
to come out, wipe the mold with a towel wrung from warm water. Hot water
spoils the gloss of puddings, and unless you know exactly how to use it,
the cream is too much melted to garnish.

All frozen puddings, water ices, sherbets and sorbets are frozen and molded
according to these directions.

The quantities given in these recipes are arranged in equal amounts, so
that for a smaller number of persons they can be easily divided.


QUANTITIES FOR SERVING

Each quart of ice cream will serve, in dessert plates, four persons. In
stem ice cream dishes, silver or glass, it will serve six persons. A quart
of ice or sherbet will fill ten small sherbet stem glasses, to serve with
the meat course at dinner. This quantity will serve in lemonade glasses
eight persons.




PHILADELPHIA ICE CREAMS


BURNT ALMOND ICE CREAM

     1 quart of cream
   1/2 pound of sugar
     4 ounces of sweet almonds
     1 tablespoonful of caramel
     1 teaspoonful of vanilla extract
     4 tablespoonfuls of sherry

Shell, blanch and roast the almonds until they are a golden brown, then
grate them. Put half the cream and all the sugar over the fire in a double
boiler. Stir until the sugar is dissolved, take it from the fire, add the
caramel and the almonds, and, when cold, add the remaining pint of cream,
the vanilla and the sherry. Freeze as directed on page 7.

This quantity will serve eight persons.


APRICOT ICE CREAM

     6 ounces of sugar
     1 quart of cream
     1 can of apricots or
     1 quart of fresh apricots

If fresh apricots are used, take an extra quarter of a pound of sugar. Put
half the cream and all the sugar over the fire in a double boiler and stir
until the sugar is dissolved; take from the fire and, when cold, add the
remaining cream. Turn the mixture into the freezer, and, when frozen fairly
stiff, add the apricots after having been pressed through a colander.
Return the lid, adjust the crank, and turn it slowly for five minutes, then
remove the dasher and repack.

This quantity should serve ten persons.


BANANA ICE CREAM

     1 quart of cream
     6 large bananas
   1/2 pound of sugar
     1 teaspoonful of vanilla

Put half the cream and all the sugar over the fire and stir until the
sugar is dissolved; take from the fire, and, when perfectly cold, add the
remaining half of the cream. Freeze the mixture, and add the bananas mashed
or pressed through a colander. Put on the lid, adjust the crank, and turn
until the mixture is frozen rather hard.

This quantity will serve ten persons.


BISCUIT ICE CREAM

     6 wine biscuits
     1 quart of cream
   1/2 pound of sugar
     1 teaspoonful of vanilla

Grate and sift the biscuits. Scald half the cream and the sugar; when cold,
add the remaining cream and the vanilla, and freeze. When frozen, remove
the dasher, stir in the powdered biscuits, and repack to ripen.

This quantity will serve six persons.


APPLE ICE CREAM

     4 large tart apples
     1 quart of cream
   1/2 pound of sugar
     1 tablespoonful of lemon juice

Put half the cream and all the sugar over the fire and stir until the sugar
is dissolved. When the mixture is perfectly cold, freeze it and add the
lemon juice and the apples, pared and grated. Finish the freezing, and
repack to ripen.

The apples must be pared at the last minute and grated into the cream. If
they are grated on a dish and allowed to remain in the air they will turn
very dark and spoil the color of the cream.


BROWN BREAD ICE CREAM

     3 half inch slices of Boston Brown Bread
     1 quart of cream
   1/2 pound of sugar
     1 teaspoonful of vanilla or
   1/4 of a vanilla bean or a teaspoonful of vanilla extract

Dry and toast the bread in the oven, grate or pound it, and put it through
an ordinary sieve. Heat half the cream and all the sugar; take from the
fire, add vanilla, and, when cold, add the remaining cream, and freeze.
When frozen, remove the dasher, stir in the brown bread, repack and stand
aside to ripen.

This quantity will serve six persons.


CARAMEL ICE CREAM, No. 1

     1 quart of cream
   1/2 pound of sugar
     1 teaspoonful of vanilla

Put four tablespoonfuls of the sugar in an iron frying pan over a strong
fire, shake until the sugar melts, turns brown, smokes and burns; add
quickly a half cupful of water; let it boil a minute, take from the fire,
and put it, with all the sugar and half the cream, in a double boiler over
the fire. Stir until the sugar is dissolved, take from the fire, and, when
cold, add the remaining cream and vanilla, and freeze.

This quantity will serve six persons.


CARAMEL ICE CREAM, No. 2

     1 quart of cream

   1/2 cupful of brown sugar
   1/2 pound of granulated sugar
     2 teaspoonfuls of vanilla

Put the brown sugar in a frying pan over the fire, shake it until it melts,
burns and smokes. Take it from the fire and add two tablespoonfuls of
water; heat until the sugar is again melted, put it in a double boiler with
the milk and all the sugar, stir until the sugar is dissolved, and stand
aside to cool. When cold, add half the cream and the vanilla, and freeze.
When frozen sufficiently stiff to remove the dasher, stir in the remaining
pint of cream whipped to a stiff froth, repack and stand aside for three
hours.

This quantity will serve ten persons.


BISQUE ICE CREAM

     1 quart of cream

     1 teaspoonful of caramel
     1 teaspoonful of vanilla
       If you use it, 4 tablespoonfuls of sherry

Pound the macaroons, kisses, lady fingers or sponge cake, and put them
through a colander. Put half the cream and all the sugar over the fire in
a double boiler; when the sugar is dissolved, stand the mixture aside to
cool; when cold, add the remaining cream, the caramel, sherry and vanilla.
Turn the mixture into the freezer, and, when frozen, add the pounded cakes;
stir the mixture until it is perfectly smooth and well mixed, and repack.
Bisque ice cream is better for a three hour stand.

This quantity will serve six persons.


CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM

     1 quart of cream
     1 pint of milk
   1/2 pound of sugar
     4 ounces of chocolate
     1 teaspoonful of vanilla or 1/4 of a vanilla bean
   1/4 of a teaspoonful of cinnamon

Grate the chocolate, put it in a double boiler with the milk; stir until
hot, and add the sugar, vanilla, cinnamon and one pint of the cream. When
cold, freeze; when frozen, remove the dasher and stir in the remaining pint
of the cream whipped to a stiff froth.

This will serve ten persons.


COFFEE ICE CREAM

     1 quart of cream
   1/2 pound of pulverized sugar
     4 ounces of so-called Mocha coffee

Grind the Mocha rather coarse, put it in the double boiler with one half
the cream, and steep over the fire for at least ten minutes. Strain through
a fine muslin or flannel bag, pressing it hard to get out all the strength
of the coffee. Add the sugar and stir until dissolved; when cold, add the
remaining pint of cream and freeze.

This will serve six persons.


CURACAO ICE CREAM

     1 quart of cream
     1 wineglassful of curacao
   1/2 pound of sugar
     2 tablespoonfuls of orange blossoms water
       Juice of two oranges

     9 ounces of powdered sugar
     4 tablespoonfuls of lemon juice
       Juice of one orange
       Grated yellow rind of 3 lemons

Mix the sugar, the grated rind and juice of the lemons, and the orange
juice together. Put half the cream in a double boiler over the fire; when
scalding hot, stand it aside until perfectly cold; add the remaining half
of the cream and freeze it rather hard. Remove the crank and the lid, add
the sugar mixture, replace the lid and crank, and turn rapidly for five
minutes; repack to ripen.

This will serve six people.

     1 large ripe pineapple or
     1 pint can of grated pineapple
       Juice of one lemon

Put half the cream and half the sugar in a double boiler over the fire;
when the sugar is dissolved, stand it aside until cold. Pare and grate the
pineapple, add the remaining half of the sugar and stand it aside. When the
cream is cold, add the remaining cream, and partly freeze. Then add the
lemon juice to the pineapple and add it to the frozen cream; turn the
freezer five minutes longer, and repack.

This will serve eight or ten persons.


GREEN GAGE ICE CREAM

     1 quart of cream
     4 ounces of sugar
     1 pint of preserved green gages, free from syrup

Press the green gages through a sieve. Add the sugar to half the cream,
stir it in a double boiler until the sugar is dissolved; when cold, add the
remaining cream. When this is partly frozen, stir in the green gage pulp,
and finish the freezing as directed on page 7.

If the green gages are colorless, add three or four drops of apple green
coloring to the cream before freezing.


RASPBERRY ICE CREAM

     1 quart of cream
     1 quart of raspberries
    12 ounces of sugar
       Juice of one lemon

Mash the raspberries; add half the sugar and the lemon juice. Put the
remaining sugar and half the cream in a double boiler; stir until the sugar
is dissolved, and stand aside to cool; when cold, add the remaining cream,
turn the mixture into the freezer, and stir until partly frozen. Remove the
lid and add the mashed raspberries, and stir again for five or ten minutes
until the mixture is sufficiently hard to repack.

This will serve eight or ten persons.


STRAWBERRY ICE CREAM

Make precisely the same as raspberry ice cream, substituting one quart of
strawberries for the raspberries.


PISTACHIO ICE CREAM

     1 quart of cream
   1/2 pound of sugar
   1/2 pound of shelled pistachio nuts
     1 teaspoonful of almond extract
    10 drops of green coloring

Blanch and pound or grate the nuts. Put half the cream and all the sugar in
a double boiler; stir until the sugar is dissolved and stand aside to cool;
when cold, add the nuts, the flavoring and the remaining cream, mix, add
the coloring, and turn into the freezer to freeze.

If green coloring matter is not at hand, a little spinach or parsley may be
chopped and rubbed with a small quantity of alcohol.

This quantity will serve six persons,


VANILLA ICE CREAM

     1 quart of cream
   1/2 pound of sugar
     1 vanilla bean or two teaspoonfuls of vanilla extract

Put the sugar and half the cream in a double boiler over the fire. Split
the vanilla bean, scrape out the seeds and add them to the hot cream, and
add the bean broken into pieces. Stir until the sugar is dissolved, and
strain through a colander. When this is cold, add the remaining cream and
freeze. This should be repacked and given two hours to ripen. Four would be
better.

This will serve six persons.

WALNUT ICE CREAM

     1 quart of cream
   1/2 pound of sugar
     1 teaspoonful of vanilla
     1 teaspoonful of caramel
   1/2 pint of black walnut meats

Put the sugar and half the cream over the fire in a double boiler; when the
sugar is dissolved, stand it aside to cool. When cold, add the remaining
cream, the walnuts, chopped, and the flavoring, and freeze.

This will serve six persons.




NEAPOLITAN CREAMS

In this group we have a set of frozen desserts called by many "ice creams,"
but which are really frozen custards, flavored. In localities where cream
is not accessible, the Neapolitan Creams are far better than milk thickened
with cornstarch or gelatin.


CHOCOLATE

     1 pint of cream
     1 pint of milk
   1/2 pound of sugar
     4 eggs
     2 ounces of chocolate
     1 small piece of stick cinnamon
     1 teaspoonful of vanilla

Put the milk and cinnamon over the fire in a double boiler. Beat the yolks
of the eggs and sugar until very light, add the well-beaten whites, and
stir this into the hot milk. As soon as the mixture begins to thicken, take
it from the fire, add the grated chocolate, and, when cold, add the cream
and the vanilla. Freeze and pack as directed on page 7.

This is sufficient to serve ten persons.


CARAMEL

     1 pint of cream
     1 pint of milk
   1/2 pound of sugar
     4 eggs
     3 tablespoonfuls of caramel
     1 teaspoonful of vanilla

Beat the yolks of the eggs until creamy and add the sugar; beat until
light, and then add the well-beaten whites of the eggs. Put the milk over
the fire in a double boiler; when hot, add the eggs, and stir and cook
until the mixture begins to thicken. Take from the fire, strain through a
fine sieve, add the vanilla and caramel, and, when cold, add the cream, and
freeze.

This will serve ten persons.


COFFEE

     1 pint of strong black coffee
     1 pint of cream
     2 eggs
   1/2 pound of sugar
     1 teaspoonful of vanilla

Beat the sugar and the yolks of the eggs until light, add the well-beaten
whites, and pour into them the coffee, boiling hot. Stir over the fire for
a minute, take from the fire, add the vanilla, and, when cold, add the
cream, and freeze.

This will serve eight persons.


VANILLA

     1 pint of cream
     1 pint of milk
   1/2 pound of sugar
     3 eggs
   1/4 vanilla bean or a teaspoonful of good extract

Put the milk over the fire in a double boiler, and add the vanilla bean,
split. Beat the yolks of the eggs and the sugar until light, add the whites
beaten to a stiff froth, and stir into them the hot milk. Return the
mixture to the double boiler and cook until it begins to thicken, or will
coat a knife blade dipped into it. Take from the fire, strain through a
colander, and, when cold, add the cream, and freeze. Repack and stand to
ripen for three hours or longer.

This will serve eight persons.


WALNUT

     1 pint of cream
     1 pint of milk
     2 eggs
   1/2 pint of chopped black walnuts
     1 teaspoonful of vanilla
     1 teaspoonful of caramel

Beat the yolks of the eggs and the sugar until light; add the well-beaten
whites, and then the milk, scalding hot. Stir over the fire in a double
boiler until the mixture begins to thicken; take from the fire and add the
vanilla and caramel. When cold, add the walnuts and cream, and freeze.

This will serve eight persons.


NEAPOLITAN BLOCKS

These are made by putting layers of various kinds and colors of ice creams
into a brick mold. Pack and freeze. At serving time, cut into slices
crosswise of the brick, and serve each slice on a paper mat.




ICE CREAMS FROM CONDENSED MILK


These creams are not so good as those made from raw cream, but with care
and good flavoring are quite as good as the ordinary Neapolitan Creams.

There is one advantage--condensed milk is not so liable to curdle when
mixed with fresh fruits. These recipes will answer also for what is sold
under the name of "Evaporated Cream." Use unsweetened milk, or allow for
the sugar in the sweetened varieties.


BANANA

     6 large bananas
   1/4 pound of sugar
     1 half pint can of condensed milk
   1/2 cupful of water
       Juice of one lemon

Press the bananas through a sieve, and add the lemon juice and sugar. Stand
aside a half hour, add milk and water, stir until the sugar is dissolved,
and freeze as directed on page 7.

This will serve six persons.


CARAMEL

   1/4 cupful of brown sugar
   1/2 cupful of granulated sugar
     1 cupful of water
     2 half pint cans of condensed milk
     1 teaspoonful of vanilla

Put the brown sugar in an iron pan, melt and brown it. When it begins to
smoke, add two tablespoonfuls of hot water. Stir until liquid. Pour out
the milk, rinse the cans with the water, add the caramel, vanilla and
granulated sugar. When the sugar is dissolved, freeze as directed on page
7.

This will serve six persons.


COCOANUT

     2 large cocoanuts
     1 pint of boiling water
   1/2 pint can of sweetened condensed milk

Grate the cocoanuts and pour over them the boiling water. Stir until it is
cool, and press in a sieve. Put the fibre in a cheese cloth and wring it
dry; add this to the water that was strained through the sieve. When cold,
add condensed milk, and freeze as directed on page 7.

This will serve eight persons.


CHOCOLATE, No. 1

     2 ounces of Baker's chocolate
   1/2 pint of water
     1 saltspoonful of ground cinnamon
     2 half pint cans of condensed milk
     1 teaspoonful of vanilla
   1/4 pound of sugar

Put the water, chocolate, sugar and cinnamon in a saucepan; stir until
boiling. Take from the fire, add the vanilla and the condensed milk. When
cold, freeze as directed on page 7.

This will serve six persons.


CHOCOLATE, No. 2

FROZEN PUDDINGS AND DESSERTS


ALASKA BAKE


Make a vanilla ice cream, one or two quarts, as the occasion demands. When
the ice cream is frozen, pack it in a brick mold, cover each side of the
mold with letter paper and fasten the bottom and lid. Wrap the whole in wax
paper and pack it in salt and ice; freeze for at least two hours before
serving time. At serving time, make a meringue from the whites of six eggs
beaten to a froth; add six tablespoonfuls of sifted powdered sugar and beat
until fine and dry. Turn the ice cream from the mold, place it on a serving
platter, and stand the platter on a steak board or an ordinary thick plank.
Cover the mold with the meringue pressed through a star tube in a pastry
bag, or spread it all over the ice cream as you would ice a cake. Decorate
the top quickly, and dust it thickly with powdered sugar; stand it under
the gas burners in a gas broiler or on the grate in a hot coal or wood oven
until it is lightly browned, and send it quickly to the table. There is no
danger of the ice cream melting if you will protect the under side of the
plate. The meringue acts as a nonconductor for the upper part.

A two quart mold with meringue will serve ten persons.

     1 pint of milk
     2 teaspoonfuls of vanilla extract or 1/2 vanilla bean
   1/2 pound of sugar
       Yolks of six eggs

Rub the rice in a dry towel, and put it over the fire in a pint of cold
water. Bring to a boil and boil twenty minutes; drain, add the milk and
cook it in a double boiler a half hour. While this is boiling, whip the
cream to a stiff froth, and stand it in a cold place until wanted. Press
the rice through a fine sieve and return it to the double boiler. Beat the
yolks of the eggs and the sugar until light, stir them into the hot rice,
and stir and cook about two minutes, until the mixture begins to thicken.
Take from the fire, add the vanilla, and stand aside until very cold. When
cold, freeze, turning the dasher rapidly toward the last. Remove the dasher

     1 pound of sugar
   1/2 cupful of water
     1 teaspoonful of lemon juice

Put the sugar and water over the fire to boil, wipe down the sides of the
pan, skim the syrup, add the lemon juice, and boil until it spins a thread.
Peel the oranges, cut them into halves crosswise, and with a sharp knife
remove the cores. Dip one piece at a time into the hot syrup and place them
on a platter to cool. Pour over any syrup that may be left.

This syrup must be thick, but not sufficiently thick to harden on the
oranges.

To dish the pudding, lift the can from the ice, wipe it carefully on the
outside, wrap the bottom of the mold in a towel dipped in boiling water,
or hold it half an instant under the cold water spigot. Then with a limber
knife or spatula loosen the pudding from the side of the can and shake it
out into the centre of a large round plate. Heap the oranges on top of
the pudding, making them in a pyramid, put the remaining quantity around
the base of the pudding, pour over the syrup and send to the table. This
pudding sounds elaborate and troublesome, but it is exceedingly palatable
and one of the handsomest of all frozen dishes.

powdered sugar. Fill the spaces in the cans with the whipped cream mixture,
and put another layer of the pistachio cream over the top. Put on the lids,
wrap each can in waxed paper, and put them down into coarse salt and ice,
to freeze for at least two hours. At serving time, turn the puddings on to
a long platter, fill the bottom of the platter with Claret or Strawberry

WATER ICES AND SHERBETS OR SORBETS


A water ice is a mixture of water, fruit and sugar, frozen without much
stirring; in fact, a water ice can be made in an ordinary tin kettle packed
in a bucket. If an ice cream freezer is used, the stirring should be done
occasionally. Personally, I prefer to pack the can, put on the lid and
fasten the hole with a cork rather than to use the dasher, stirring now and
then with a paddle. If you use the crank, turn slowly for a few minutes,
then allow the mixture to stand for five minutes; turn slowly again, and
again rest, and continue this until the water ice is frozen. A much longer
time is required for freezing water ice than ice cream.

When the mixture is thoroughly frozen, take out the dasher, scrape down the
sides of the can, give the ice a thorough beating with a wooden spoon; put
the cork in the lid of the can, draw the water from the tub, repack it with
coarse ice and salt, cover it with paper and a piece of blanket or burlap,
and stand aside for two or three hours to ripen just as you would ice
cream.

When it is necessary to make water ice every day or two, it is best to make
a syrup and stand it aside ready for use.

Fruit jellies may be used in the place of fresh fruits, allowing one pint
of jelly, the juice of one lemon and a half pound of sugar to each quart of
water.

When water ice is correctly frozen, it has the appearance of hard wet snow.
It must not be frothy nor light.

A sherbet or sorbet is made from the same mixture as a water ice, stirred
constantly while it is freezing, and has a meringue, made from the white of
one egg and a tablespoonful of powdered sugar, stirred in after the dasher
is removed.

Frozen fruits are mixed and frozen the same as water ices, that is, they
are only stirred occasionally while freezing, but the fruit must be mashed
or it will form little balls of ice through a partly frozen mixture. The
only difference between a water ice and a frozen fruit is that the mixture

   2/3 cupful of sugar
   1/4 pound of dates
   1/2 pint of milk
     1 pint of cream
     1 teaspoonful of vanilla

Wash the rice, throw it into boiling water, boil rapidly twenty minutes;
drain, add the milk, and cook in a double boiler fifteen minutes. Add the
sugar, the gelatin that has been moistened in cold water, and the dates
chopped. Take from the fire, add the vanilla, and when the mixture is cold,
fold in carefully the whipped cream. Freeze as directed in a mold, and
serve with cold quince jelly sauce.

This will serve ten persons.


DUCHESS MOUSSE

     4 eggs
   1/2 cupful of sugar
     1 pint of cream
     1 teaspoonful of vanilla
     5 drops of cochineal

Beat the yolks of the eggs and the sugar until very, very light; fold
in the whites of the eggs and the flavoring. Stand the bowl in a pan of
boiling water and beat continuously until the ingredients are hot; take
from the fire and beat constantly for ten minutes. When this is cool, fold
in the cream whipped to a stiff froth, pack and freeze.

Serve with quince jelly sauce poured over the mousse.

This will serve eight persons.


PISTACHIO MOUSSE

     4 ounces of pistachio nuts
     1 tablespoonful of gelatin
     1 pint of water
     1 pint of cream
   1/2 pound of sugar
     1 teaspoonful of almond extract
     3 drops of green coloring

Blanch the pistachio nuts and put them through a meat grinder. Boil
the sugar and water for five minutes; when cool, add the coloring, the
pistachio nuts, and the gelatin moistened in a little cold water. When this
is cold, fold in the cream beaten to a stiff froth, and freeze in a mold as
directed.

If this is not too well mixed the cream will separate, which makes the
handsomer dessert. When the mousse is turned from the mold it will then
have a solid white base with a rather green, beautiful transparent mixture
at the top.

This will serve ten persons.


RICE MOUSSE WITH A COMPOTE OF MANDARINS

   1/2 cupful of rice
     1 tablespoonful of gelatin
   2/3 cupful of sugar
     1 pint of milk
     1 pint of cream
   1/4 pound of candied cherries
     1 teaspoonful of vanilla

Wash and boil the rice in water for twenty minutes, drain, put it in a
double boiler with the milk and sugar; stir until the sugar is dissolved,
cover the kettle and cook slowly for twenty minutes. Press through a sieve,
add the vanilla, and the gelatin covered with cold water. When this is
cold, fold in the cream whipped to a stiff froth; pack and freeze.

I usually freeze this in the ordinary ice cream can; simply remove the
dasher, put in the mixture and pack it to freeze for two or three hours.

While this is ripening, separate the mandarins into carpels. Boil together
for five minutes one pound of sugar, a half pint of water and the juice of
one lemon; take from the fire, add at once the carpels, stir lightly until
they are thoroughly covered with the syrup and stand aside until _very
cold_.

At serving time, wipe the outside of the freezing can with a warm towel,
turn the mousse into the centre of a round dish, heap the carpels around
the base and over the top in the form of a pyramid, pour over the syrup,
and send at once to the table.

This will serve twelve persons.




SAUCES FOR ICE CREAMS


HOT CHOCOLATE SAUCE

   1/2 cupful of cream or condensed milk
     2 ounces of chocolate
     1 cupful of sugar
     1 teaspoonful of vanilla

Put all the ingredients into a saucepan and stir over the fire until they
reach boiling point, boil until the mixture slightly hardens when dropped
into cold water. Add the vanilla, turn at once into the sauceboat and send
to the table. This must be sufficiently thin to dip nicely over the ice
cream.


MAPLE SAUCE

     1 cupful of sugar
     1 teaspoonful of lemon juice
     1 cupful of water
     1 teaspoonful of maple flavoring

Put half the sugar in an iron saucepan and stand it over the fire until it
melts and browns, add hastily the water, the remaining sugar and the lemon
juice, and boil for about two minutes; take from the fire and add the
flavoring. This may be served plain, or with chopped fruit or nuts added.


CLARET SAUCE

Boil one cupful of sugar and a half cupful of water with a saltspoonful of
cream of tartar for five minutes. Take from the fire and add one cupful of
claret, and stand aside until icy cold.


NUT SAUCE

     1 cupful of sugar
   1/2 cupful of chopped nuts
     1 cupful of water
     1 teaspoonful of caramel
     2 teaspoonfuls of sherry

Boil the sugar and water with a saltspoonful of cream of tartar or a
teaspoonful of lemon juice for five minutes, take from the fire and add all
the other ingredients, and stand aside to cool.


MONTROSE SAUCE

   1/2 tablespoonful of granulated gelatin
   1/4 cupful of sugar
   1/2 cupful of milk
     1 pint of cream
     2 tablespoonfuls of brandy
     1 teaspoonful of vanilla
       Yolks of 3 eggs

Cover the gelatin with milk, let it soak a half hour, and put it, with the
milk, in a double boiler over the fire. Beat the yolks of the eggs and the
sugar together, add them to the hot milk, stir about one minute until the
mixture begins to thicken, take from the fire, and, when cold, add the
vanilla and the brandy, and, if you like it, four tablespoonfuls of sherry.
Stand this aside until very, very cold.


ORANGE SAUCE

   1/2 pint of orange juice
   1/2 pint of water
   1/2 cupful of sugar
     1 tablespoonful of arrowroot
       Whites of three eggs

Add the sugar to the water, and, when boiling hot, add the arrowroot
moistened. Beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, add gradually the
hot mixture, beating all the while. Add the orange juice, beat again. Turn
it into a sauceboat and stand aside until very cold.


WALNUT SAUCE

Melt maple sugar with a little water, and add to each cupful of syrup a
half cupful of chopped black walnuts. Maple syrup may also be used by
adding half the quantity of boiling water and the nuts.




REFRESHMENTS FOR AFFAIRS


In arranging this matter, I have made an earnest effort to be of service
to the housewife without or with one maid, as well as to those who are
fortunate enough to have trained help.

It is, perhaps, unnecessary to say that elaborate refreshments are entirely
out of place at small afternoon or evening cards. An ice, with a wafer,
or cake and coffee, served on card tables, are sufficient. A salad, with
bread and butter sandwiches and coffee, or a salad sandwich with coffee,
make a nice combination. Hot dishes, even light entrees, seem to call
for a dessert, or another course and coffee. For wedding and other large
receptions serve a greater variety of dishes--jellied meats, boned chicken,
salads, sandwiches, ices, cakes and coffee. In winter creamed dishes may be
served in paper cases on the same plate with salads and other cold dishes.
Serve coffee in small cups after refreshments.

Many so called elaborate dishes are quite easily made, and entrees are
frequently quite as good when rewarmed.

Chicken croquettes may be made and fried early in the day, ready to rewarm
on brown paper in a baking pan in a hot oven ten minutes before serving
time. Sandwiches will keep perfectly well for several hours if wrapped in
a damp towel and closed in a tin bread box. Salad sandwiches are better,
however, if made as near serving time as possible.

If a large reception is to be given, even with good help, prepare as many
dishes as possible the day before, to avoid confusion on the fixed day.

Refreshments for small affairs need not necessarily cost much time or
money. A half cupful of chopped left-over steak, a couple of chops or a bit
of chicken or a box of sardines, make a good foundation for molds of tomato
jelly. Served with bread and butter sandwiches and coffee they are quite
sufficient for afternoon or evening cards.

Many of the ices in this book are new and attractive. The new sorbets are
liked by those who are always striving for a change. Many are old and
reliable.

At large affairs, serve from the dining table.

At card parties, large and small, serve on the card tables, using a small
tea cloth on each table.

At afternoon teas, serve from the tea table in the drawing room.

At lawn parties, serve from a large table on the lawn. Small tables may be
placed here and there for the convenience of guests.

Every day afternoon tea may be served, in the summer on the porch, in the
winter, in the living room or library.

If two dishes only are served, be sure that they harmonize with each other
and with the manner of service.

Suitable and hygienic combinations are always to be considered, but the
aesthetic side seems to me of equal importance.


COFFEE FOR LARGE HOME AFFAIRS

Allow eleven ounces of finely ground coffee to each gallon of water. This
will serve twenty five persons with one coffee cup each, and forty persons
with after-dinner cups. The better way to make a large quantity of coffee
without an urn is to purchase a new wash boiler. Wash it and put in the
required quantity of water (cold). Weigh the coffee and divide it into half
pound lots. Put each lot in a small cheese cloth bag; tie the top of the
bag, allowing room for the coffee to swell. Put the bags in the water an
hour before serving time, bring slowly to a boil, and then boil rapidly for
five minutes. Remove the bags at once, pressing them well. Keep the coffee
very hot until it is all served.

Coffee is not spoiled by being kept at boiling point for some time, if the
grounds are removed.




SOUPS


BOUILLON

     2 pounds of chopped lean beef
     2 quarts of cold water
     1 small onion
    12 cloves
     2 tablespoonfuls of sugar
     2 teaspoonfuls of salt
    12 whole peppercorns
       A dash of cayenne
       Juice of half a lemon

Put the sugar in the soup kettle, add the onion, sliced, and shake until
the onion is thoroughly browned and the sugar almost burned; add the meat,
shake it for a moment, and add the water. Cover, bring to boiling point,
and put over a slow fire to simmer for two hours. Add all the seasonings
and simmer one hour longer. Strain through a colander, pressing the
meat. Beat the whites of two eggs slightly, then whisk them into the
warm bouillon, and add the juice of the lemon. Bring to boiling point,
boil rapidly five minutes, let it stand a moment, and strain through two
thicknesses of cheese cloth. This should stand until it is perfectly cold,
so that every particle of fat may be removed from the surface. Reheat to
serve.

This will serve ten persons, using ordinary bouillon cups.


CLAM BOUILLON

    50 large clams
     2 quarts of water
    12 whole peppercorns
   1/2 teaspoonful of celery seed

Wash and scrub the clams thoroughly. Put them, a few at a time, in the soup
kettle, the bottom of which has been covered with a pint of boiling water.
Boil rapidly, take the clams out with a skimmer, and put in another lot,
and so continue until all the clams have been cooked. Remove them from the
shells, saving all the liquor. Chop and return them, with the liquor and
remaining water, to the soup kettle. Simmer gently a half hour, then add
the peppercorns, crushed, and the celery seed. Cover the kettle, take it
from the fire and allow it to stand until perfectly cold. Strain through
two thicknesses of cheese cloth. Reheat to serve.

This will serve fifteen persons.


BELLEVUE BOUILLON

     1 quart of plain or chicken bouillon
     1 quart of clam bouillon
   1/2 pint of cream
       Paprika

This is one of the most elegant of all bouillons. Heat the bouillons
separately, mix them at the last minute, pour at once into heated cups, put
a tablespoonful of whipped cream on the top of each cup, garnish with a
dusting of paprika, and send to the table.

This will serve ten persons; in a pinch, twelve.


CHICKEN BOUILLON

     1 four pound fowl
     3 quarts of water
     1 onion
     2 tablespoonfuls of sugar
     1 teaspoonful of salt
     1 bay leaf
     1 saltspoonful of celery seed, or one half cupful of chopped celery
     1 saltspoonful of black pepper

Draw the chicken and cut it up as for a fricassee. Scald and skin the feet,
and crack them thoroughly with your cleaver knife. Put the sugar in a soup
kettle, add the onion, sliced, shake over a quick fire until brown, add the
chicken and the water, bring to boiling point, and skim. Simmer gently for
two hours. Add all the seasonings, simmer one hour longer, and strain. Add
the juice of half a lemon and the whites of two eggs, slightly beaten. Boil
rapidly five minutes, and strain through two thicknesses of cheese cloth.
Reheat to serve. This may be used in place of beef bouillon, with the clam
broth, for Bellevue bouillon.

This will serve twelve persons.


OYSTER BOUILLON

    50 fat oysters
     2 quarts of water
    12 whole peppercorns
    12 whole allspice
 1-1/2 teaspoonfuls of salt

Drain and wash the oysters. Throw them at once in a hot kettle, shake until
the gills have curled, cover the kettle, and simmer gently for fifteen
minutes. Drain again, this time saving the liquor. Return it to the kettle
with the peppercorns and allspice, crushed, and water. Chop the oysters
with a silver knife, put them back in the kettle, simmer gently a half
hour, and add the salt. Strain through two thicknesses of cheese cloth,
reheat and serve with whipped cream on top of each cup.

This serves fifteen persons.


TOMATO PUREE a la RORER

     1 quart can of tomatoes
   1/2 pint of cream
     1 quart of chicken bouillon
     2 tablespoonfuls of butter
     2 tablespoonfuls of arrowroot
     1 bay leaf
     1 blade of mace
     1 onion
     1 teaspoonful of salt
     1 teaspoonful of paprika

Add the onion, paprika, mace and bay leaf to the tomatoes, boil rapidly
five minutes. Moisten the arrowroot with three or four tablespoonfuls of
cold water, add it to the hot tomato, boil ten minutes, and press through
a sieve. Add the chicken bouillon, boil ten minutes, add the butter, and,
when the butter is thoroughly dissolved, turn at once into cups. Put a
tablespoonful of whipped cream on top of each, and serve.

This will serve ten persons.


GLAZE

Glaze is absolutely necessary for fine cooking, either for the browning of
sweetbreads, birds or chickens.

Cover a half box of gelatin with a half cupful of cold water to soak for an
hour. Put one quart of good bouillon, chicken or beef, over the fire, and
boil it rapidly until reduced to a pint; add the gelatin. As soon as the
gelatin is dissolved, strain the mixture. Put four tablespoonfuls of sugar
into an iron saucepan, stir until it is browned, then add to it slowly the
hot glaze, stir until it is thoroughly melted, turn it into a china or
granite receptacle, and stand away to cool. Keep this in the refrigerator,
and use it according to directions.




SWEETBREADS


SWEETBREADS a la CREME, No. 1

     2 pairs of calves' sweetbreads
     1 can of mushrooms
     1 pint of milk
     4 level tablespoonfuls of butter
     4 level tablespoonfuls of flour
     1 level teaspoonful of salt
     1 saltspoonful of white pepper

Wash the sweetbreads and trim them. Throw them in a saucepan of boiling
water and simmer gently for one hour; drain and throw them in cold water.
The water in which they were boiled may be used for stock. When they are
thoroughly cold, remove the membrane, and pick them into small pieces.
Rub the butter and flour together in a saucepan, add the milk, stir until
boiling, add the mushrooms, chopped fine, the sweetbreads, salt and pepper.
Stir until it again reaches the boiling point, cover and stand over hot
water for twenty minutes. Serve in ramekin dishes, pate shells or paper
cases. This will fill twelve cases, or fourteen pate shells.


SWEETBREADS a la CREME, No. 2

     1 pound of fresh mushrooms
     2 pairs of calves' sweetbreads
   1/2 pint of milk
     4 level tablespoonfuls of butter
     4 level tablespoonfuls of flour
     1 teaspoonful of salt
     1 saltspoonful of white pepper

Wash and stem the mushrooms; do not peel them. With a silver knife cut them
into slices. Put half the butter in a saucepan, add the mushrooms and half
the milk, and the salt and pepper. Cover the saucepan, and stew slowly a
half hour. Rub the remaining butter and flour together; drain the liquor
from the mushrooms, add it, with the rest of the milk, to the butter and
flour. Stir until boiling, add the mushrooms and sweetbreads that have been
boiled and picked apart. Cover the saucepan, stand it over hot water, or
use a double boiler, pushing the boiler to the back of the stove for twenty
to thirty minutes. The saucepan must be kept closely covered, or the aroma
of the mushrooms will be lost.

This will fill sixteen cases, or fourteen pate shells, or alone it will
serve twelve persons.


SWEETBREADS a la BORDELAISE

     1 pair of calves' sweetbreads
   1/2 pint of stock
     1 onion
     1 bay leaf
   1/2 teaspoonful of salt
     1 can of mushrooms
     1 teaspoonful of browning or kitchen bouquet
     1 saltspoonful of white pepper
     2 level tablespoonfuls of butter
     2 level tablespoonfuls of flour

Wash the sweetbreads, put them in a saucepan, add the bay leaf, onion and
one pint of cold water; bring to boiling point, and simmer gently one hour.
Save the water in which they were boiled. Throw the sweetbreads into cold
water, remove the membrane and pick them apart. Put the butter and flour in
a saucepan; when thoroughly mixed, add a half pint of stock in which the
sweetbreads were boiled, stir until boiling, add the mushrooms, drained,
and the seasoning. Bring to boiling point, and push to the back of the fire
for ten minutes. Skim off any butter that comes to the surface, add the
sweetbreads, cook gently ten minutes longer, and serve in either pate
cases, ramekin dishes, or paper cases.

This will serve eight persons.


BAKED SWEETBREADS

     2 pairs of calves' sweetbreads
     1 can of French peas
     3 tablespoonfuls of butter
     2 tablespoonfuls of glaze
     1 teaspoonful of salt
     1 saltspoonful of pepper

Wash the sweetbreads and soak them in cold water; cut them apart and trim
them neatly. Sprinkle the bottom of a baking pan with a chopped onion, put
the sweetbreads on top, dust them lightly with salt and pepper, baste them
with one tablespoonful of the butter, melted, and run them in a quick oven
to bake for twenty minutes. Then brush them thoroughly with glaze and bake
them ten minutes longer. Drain, wash and heat the peas, add the remaining
butter and season them with salt and pepper. Put the peas in the bottom
of the serving dish, dish the sweetbreads in them and send at once to
the table. These may also be served in individual dishes, cutting the
sweetbreads in small pieces, so they may be eaten with a fork.

They will serve from four to six people. The throat sweetbread may be cut
into halves, but as a rule one sweetbread is served to each person.


LAMBS' SWEETBREADS IN PAPER CASES

     8 lambs' sweetbreads
   1/2 box of gelatin
     1 pint of beef stock or chicken bouillon
     1 can of peas
     1 head of celery
     2 level tablespoonfuls of butter
     2 level tablespoonfuls of flour
   1/2 pint of milk
     1 lemon
       Hearts of lettuce
       Yolks of two eggs
       Salt and pepper

Wash the sweetbreads, put them in a saucepan, cover with boiling water,
add two tablespoonfuls of vinegar and a sliced onion. Cook gently for
three-quarters of an hour. Drain, put them in a baking pan, brush them with
butter, add a few tablespoonfuls of glaze or stock, put over three or four
slices of bacon, and cook in the oven a half hour, basting three or four
times. Rub the butter and flour together, add the milk, stir until boiling,
add two tablespoonfuls of the soaked gelatin, a half teaspoonful of salt
and a little white pepper. Take from the fire and add hastily the beaten
yolks of the eggs. Cover the bottom of a cold baking pan with muffin rings,
put one sweetbread into each muffin ring. When the sauce is a little cool,
cover the sweetbreads thoroughly, filling the rings quite full. Stand these
away over night in a cold place.

Dissolve the remaining gelatin in the hot bouillon, season, add the lemon
juice, and stand it aside over night. At serving time, remove the contents
from the rings and place them in paper cases of the same size. Turn the
clear aspic out on to a towel and cut it into pretty shapes. Decorate the
top of the cases with this aspic, placing a sprig of green in the centre.
Drain and press the cold peas through a sieve, and season them with salt
and pepper; put this pulp in a pastry bag with a star tube, and decorate
the top of each mold. Serve at once with mayonnaise passed in a boat.

Another way is to fill the bottom of the paper cases with finely chopped
celery, mixed with mayonnaise, and put the sweetbreads on top, omitting
the peas. If made well, these are exceedingly handsome. One "ring" will be
served to each person.


SWEETBREADS a la NEWBURG

     2 pairs of calves' sweetbreads
     1 can of mushrooms
     4 hard boiled yolks of eggs
   1/2 pint of milk
     2 level tablespoonfuls of butter
     1 tablespoonful of flour
   1/2 teaspoonful of salt
     1 saltspoonful of white pepper
   1/2 saltspoonful of grated nutmeg
       A dash of cayenne

Cook the sweetbreads as directed in first recipe; when cold, pick them
apart, rejecting the membrane. Rub the butter and flour together, add the
milk, stir until boiling, and add this slowly to the mashed yolks of the
eggs. Work and stir until you have a perfectly smooth paste. Press it
through a fine sieve, add the salt, pepper, mushrooms and sweetbreads.
Stand over hot water for twenty minutes, until thoroughly hot. Add, if you
use it, four tablespoonfuls of sherry, and serve.

This will serve ten persons.




SHELL-FISH DISHES


DEVILED CRABS

    12 crabs, or one pint of crab flake
     4 hard boiled eggs
     2 level tablespoonfuls of butter
     2 tablespoonfuls of soft bread crumbs
     1 tablespoonful of flour
     1 teaspoonful of salt
     1 saltspoonful of grated nutmeg
     1 teaspoonful of onion juice
   1/2 pint of milk
       A dash of cayenne

Chop the whites of the hard boiled eggs very, very fine. Put the yolks
through a sieve. Rub the butter and flour together, and add the milk; stir
until boiling, take from the fire, and add the bread crumbs and the eggs.
Add all the seasoning to the crab flake, mix the two together, and fill at
once into the shells. The shells must be quite full, so that there will be
no danger of the fat being held in the shell. Dip the shells in egg, then
cover them thickly with bread crumbs. It is well to egg and bread crumb the
upper side again; in fact both dippings may be on the upper sides, leaving
the shells red underneath. Put these in a frying basket and fry for a
minute in hot, deep fat. Serve one to each person.

This quantity should fill eight shells.


CRAB BACKS a la CARACAS

     1 dozen crabs, or six backs and a pint of crab flake
     1 teaspoonful of salt
     1 teaspoonful of onion juice
       A dash of cayenne

Add the seasoning to the crab flakes, and mix without breaking the flakes.
Fill the mixture into the backs, put a teaspoonful of butter on the top
of each, sprinkle lightly with crumbs, and bake in a quick oven twenty
minutes,


CRAB MEAT a la DEWEY

     1 pint of crab flake
     2 tablespoonfuls of butter
     2 tablespoonfuls of flour
     1 teaspoonful of salt
     1 red and one green pepper
   1/2 pint of chicken stock, or milk
     2 tablespoonfuls of sherry
       Yolks of two eggs

Drop the peppers into hot fat just a moment and rub off the skin, remove
the seeds and chop the flesh fine. Put this, with the butter, in a
saucepan, and shake over the fire until the peppers are soft. Add the
flour, mix, and add the stock or milk; stir until boiling, add the salt and
pepper and the crab flakes. Do not stir, but heat slowly over hot water.
When hot, add the yolks of the eggs, beaten with two tablespoonfuls of
cream. Heat again, just a moment, being careful not to curdle the eggs, and
serve on toast.

This dish is very nice when made in a chafing dish, and will serve six
people.


LOBSTER CUTLETS

     1 pint of lobster meat
     2 level tablespoonfuls of butter
     4 level tablespoonfuls of flour
   1/2 pint of milk
     1 teaspoonful of salt
     1 teaspoonful of onion juice
     1 saltspoonful of white pepper
   1/2 saltspoonful of grated nutmeg
       Yolk of one egg
       A dash of cayenne

Chop the boiled lobster rather fine with a silver knife, and add to it all
the seasoning. Rub the butter and flour together in a saucepan, add the
milk, stir until you have a smooth, thick paste, add the yolk of the egg,
cook a moment longer, add the lobster, and turn out to cool. When cold,
form into cutlet shaped croquettes, dip in egg, roll in bread crumbs,
and fry in deep hot fat. Put a small claw in the end of each cutlet to
represent the bone. Serve with these either cream sauce or sauce tartar.

This quantity should make eight cutlets.


LOBSTER NEWBURG

Make this precisely the same as crabs Newburg, using one pint of boiled
lobster meat. Cut the lobster in cubes of about one inch. Purchase one
large or two small lobsters.


OYSTER CROQUETTES

    50 fat oysters
     4 level tablespoonfuls of flour
     2 level tablespoonfuls of butter
     1 tablespoonful of chopped parsley
     1 teaspoonful of salt
     1 teaspoonful of onion juice
   1/2 saltspoonful of nutmeg
     1 saltspoonful of white pepper
       Yolks of two eggs

Drain and wash the oysters, throw them into a hot kettle, shake until the
gills curl and the liquid boils. Boil five minutes and drain, saving the
liquor. There should be a half cupful of liquor. Chop the oysters and add
them to the liquor. Rub the butter and flour together, add the oysters and
liquor, stir until the mixture reaches boiling point, and push to the back
of the stove where it will cook for ten minutes. Add all the seasoning and
the yolks of the eggs, cook just a minute, and turn out to cool. This must
stand either over night, or must be placed directly on the ice for at least
four hours. When cold, form into small cylinder shaped croquettes, dip in
egg and bread crumbs, and fry in deep hot fat.

This quantity will make one dozen good sized cylinders.




POULTRY AND GAME DISHES


CHICKEN CROQUETTES

     1 four pound chicken
   1/2 pint of milk
     2 level tablespoonfuls of butter
     4 level tablespoonfuls of flour
     2 teaspoonfuls of salt
     2 teaspoonfuls of onion juice
     2 tablespoonfuls of chopped parsley
     1 saltspoonful of grated nutmeg
     1 saltspoonful of white pepper
       A dash of cayenne

Draw, truss the chicken, put it into boiling water, boil it rapidly for
ten minutes, and let it simmer until tender. When cold, remove the meat,
rejecting the bones and skin. Chop the meat with a chopping knife; do not
put it through the meat grinder. When fine, add all the seasoning and mix
thoroughly. Put the milk in a saucepan over the fire, and add the butter
and flour, rubbed together. Stir and cook until you have a smooth paste,
add the chicken, mix thoroughly, and turn out to cool. When cold, form into
croquettes, dip in an egg, beaten with a tablespoonful of water, roll in
dry bread crumbs, and fry in deep hot fat. Serve plain, or with French
peas.

This will make thirteen large croquettes.

One pair of thoroughly cooked sweetbreads may be chopped with the chicken,
or you may add a pair of parboiled calf's brains; this increases quantity,
and makes the croquettes more creamy.

This should make sixteen large cylinders or pyramids, serving sixteen
persons.

The meat from the chicken after it is chopped should measure one quart.
Any other meat may be substituted for chicken, but could not be used, of
course, for an elegant affair.


CHICKEN a la CREME

       The white meat of one cooked chicken
     1 pair of calves' sweetbreads

       Yolks of two eggs

Cut the chicken into cubes of a half inch. Boil the sweetbreads and pick
them apart, rejecting the membrane. Drain and wash the mushrooms, cut them
into halves and mix them with the sweetbread and chicken. Rub the butter
and flour together, and add the milk; when boiling, add salt, pepper, onion
juice and meat. Stand this over hot water in a covered saucepan for twenty
minutes, add the yolks of the eggs, slightly beaten, and bring just to
boiling point.

centre of the bottom, and around the edge a ring of peas. Put the stock and
bread over the fire, and, when boiling, add the chicken and seasonings,
stir until it reaches the boiling point, take from the fire, and add the
eggs, well beaten. Put this carefully in the cups, cover the top with oiled
paper, stand the cups in a shallow pan partly filled with hot water, and
cook in the oven about twenty minutes, until the contents are "set" in the
centre. Heat the remaining quantity of peas, and season them with salt and
pepper. Turn the boudins on a platter, surround them with the hot peas, and
send them at once to the table.

This will serve eight persons.

       The white meat of one chicken
   1/2 pint of soft white bread crumbs
   1/2 cupful of milk
     1 teaspoonful of salt
     1 saltspoonful of white pepper
       The whites of five eggs

Put the raw meat of the chicken twice through the meat chopper, then put
it in a mortar and pound it to a paste, or work it in a bowl with a wooden
spoon. Boil the bread and milk, stirring constantly; when this is cold, add
the salt, pepper and four tablespoonfuls of cream; work it gradually into
the chicken meat. This must be a perfectly smooth paste. Add the unbeaten
whites of two eggs; when they are thoroughly incorporated, fold in the well
beaten whites of the three eggs. Put at once into an oiled Charlotte mold
or into small timbale molds.

The molds may be garnished with mushrooms, or chopped truffles, or peas.
Stand them in a pan of hot water, cover with oiled paper and cook in the
oven, small molds twenty-five minutes, a large mold thirty-five. Serve hot,
with cream mushroom sauce.

This quantity in small molds should serve twelve people; in a large mold,
ten.


CREAM MUSHROOM SAUCE

     1 can of mushrooms

COLD DISHES


POULET EN BELLEVUE

   1/2 box of gelatin
     1 pint of chicken stock
     1 bay leaf
     1 onion
       The white meat of two chickens
       Salt and pepper

Remove the white meat carefully from two boiled chickens; split the breasts
into halves, long ways. Cover the gelatin with a half cupful of cold water
to soak for a half hour. Add the seasonings to the stock or bouillon, bring
to a boil, add the gelatin, and if not clear, clarify with the white of an
egg. Add the juice of a lemon and strain. Take small oblong china or tin
molds, garnish the bottoms with fancy bits of good red pepper and chopped
truffles, baste over a little of the hot aspic, and let them stand until
very cold. Cool the remaining aspic, but do not allow it to become solid.
Put on top of each mold a half breast of chicken, dust with salt and
pepper, pour over the cold aspic and stand them aside over night. At
serving time dip the molds quickly into hot water, turn out the cutlets,
dish them on luncheon plates, and garnish with hearts of lettuce. Pass
mayonnaise dressing.

This will make eight molds and serve eight persons. Use the dark meat for
fricassee or stew of chicken.


TOMATOES a l'ALGERIENNE

       The white meat of one chicken
    24 perfect tomatoes
   1/4 box of gelatin
   1/2 pint of chicken stock
   1/2 pint of cream
     1 teaspoonful of anchovy paste
     3 heads of fine lettuce
   1/2 pint of mayonnaise

Peel the tomatoes, cut off the stem end and scoop out the hard portion and
the seeds; put the tomatoes on the ice. Put the meat of the chicken through
the meat grinder, season it with the anchovy paste, if you have it, and
salt and pepper. Soak the gelatin in a half cupful of cold water, add the
chicken stock, bring to a boil, add a half teaspoonful of salt, a dash of
pepper, and the juice of half a lemon. Mix a part of this with the chicken.
Whip the cream, stir it into the chicken mixture, and fill it into the
tomatoes, making them smooth on top. When the tomatoes are very cold and
the aspic is cool, but not thick, baste just a little over the top, dust
thickly with chopped parsley and finely chopped almonds, and stand them in
a cold place for several hours. Arrange each tomato in a little nest of
lettuce leaves, and pass with them mayonnaise dressing. If these are made
well, they are the most sightly of the small cold dishes, and cost almost
nothing.

This, of course, will be served to twenty-four persons.

Tongue, sardines, lobster, crab meat or cold left-over meat may be
substituted for chicken.


GALANTINE OF CHICKEN

     2 chickens
   1/2 pound of boiled ham
   1/4 pound of larding pork
     1 can of mushrooms
     2 teaspoonfuls of salt
     1 egg
     1 pound of lean veal
     2 truffles
       Salt and pepper

Singe the chickens, and remove the head and feet; place the chicken on the
table with the breast down. Take a small, sharp-pointed sabatier knife and
cut the skin from neck to rump right down the back bone. Carefully and
slowly run the knife between the bones and the flesh, keeping it always
close to the bone. Take out first the wings, then loosen the carcass, and
then take out the legs. Unjoint and separate each bone, and take it out as
you come to it. Do not take the small bones from the wings; they may be
cut off. When you have removed all the flesh from the bones, keeping it
perfectly whole, and without breaking the skin, wipe the skin and put it on
the table; draw the legs and the wings inside. Take all the raw meat from
the other chicken, rejecting the skin and bones, but you do not have to
bone this one carefully. Put it in the meat grinder, with half the ham, all
the veal and half the bacon. When chopped, season it with two teaspoonfuls
of salt, and two saltspoonfuls of white pepper; add the egg and mix
thoroughly. Put a thin layer of this into the boned chicken, put in here
and there long pieces of the remaining ham and bacon, a layer of mushrooms,
blocks of truffles, then another layer of the forcemeat, and so continue
until you have used all the ingredients. Pull up the skin and sew it down
the back, making a perfect roll. Tie the neck and rump. Roll this in cheese
cloth, fasten it securely, and sew the cheese cloth so that the roll will
be perfect when done.

Put all the bones in the soup kettle, add a sliced onion, a bay leaf,
and sufficient cold water to come just to the top of the bones. Bring to
boiling point, and put in the "galantine," as the chicken roll is called.
Cover the kettle, and boil continuously for four hours. When done, slightly
cool, remove the cloth, and stand it away until perfectly cold. Strain the
water, which should measure two quarts; add to it a box of gelatin that has
been soaked in a cupful of water for an hour. Bring this to boiling point,
season it with salt and pepper, add the juice of a lemon and the whites
of two eggs, slightly beaten. Boil five minutes, and strain through two
thicknesses of cheese cloth. Select a long round pudding mold, or a regular
boned chicken mold, something like a large melon mold; baste the mold
inside with this liquid jelly, decorate it in patterns or unconventional
designs, using green and red pepper, the hard boiled white of egg and peas.
Allow the remaining jelly to cool, but not stiffen. After you finish the
decorations, baste them carefully with, cold gelatin and stand the mold on
ice. Then put in a little more cold jelly, until you have a good base upon
which to rest the "galantine." Put it in, breast side down, and pour over
the remaining gelatin. Stand in a cold place for twenty-four hours. When
ready to serve, wipe the mold with a warm cloth, and turn the "galantine"
on to a long platter. Garnish the platter with hearts of lettuce. To serve,
cut the "galantine" in the thinnest possible slices, and serve it with a
salad, either celery, or mixed vegetables, or plain lettuce; or it may be
served with a sauce tartar or plain mayonnaise dressing. This is one of the
most elegant of cold dishes, and will serve twenty-five persons.


CHICKEN MOUSSE

     1 pint of cooked chopped chicken
   1/2 pint of milk
     2 level tablespoonfuls of butter
     1 teaspoonful of salt
     1 level tablespoonful of flour
     1 tablespoonful of granulated gelatin
     1 saltspoonful of white pepper
   1/2 pint of cream

Rub the butter and the flour together over the fire, add the milk, stir
until boiling, and add the gelatin that has been soaked in a couple of
tablespoonfuls of cold water for fifteen minutes. Add the salt, pepper and
chicken, mix thoroughly and stand it aside to cool. Beat the cream to a
stiff froth. Make a half cupful of mayonnaise from the yolk of one egg
and eight tablespoonfuls of olive oil; stir the cream gradually into the
mayonnaise and then add it carefully to the cold chicken mixture. Turn it
into an ordinary melon pudding mold, cover closely and stand it in a bucket
of cracked ice and salt. It is wise to bind the cover seam to keep out the
salt water. When slightly frozen, which will take about two hours, remove
the lid, turn out the mousse, cover the top with first a ring of hard
boiled whites, chopped fine, then a ring of finely chopped parsley, inside
this a ring of the yolks of the eggs pressed through a sieve, and right in
the centre a sprig of curly parsley. Send at once to the table. Lobster,
crab flakes and cold roasted game may be used according to this recipe.

This will serve eight persons at a reception. At a luncheon only six
persons.


PATE-DE-FOIE-GRAS IN ASPIC

     1 box of granulated gelatin
     1 teaspoonful of beef extract
     1 small onion
     1 bay leaf
     1 blade of mace
     1 truffle
     1 carrot
     1 green pepper
     1 red pepper
     1 lemon
     1 tureen of foie-gras

Cover the gelatin with a half cupful of cold water to soak for a half hour.
Put all the vegetables and seasoning in one quart of cold water, bring to
boiling point, simmer gently twenty minutes, add the beef extract, one
teaspoonful of salt and a saltspoonful of black pepper. Add the gelatin,
stir until the gelatin is dissolved, and strain. Add the juice of the lemon
and the whites of two eggs, slightly beaten. Bring to boiling point, boil
rapidly for five minutes, and strain through two thicknesses of cheese
cloth. Cut the peppers into fancy shapes. Chop the truffle fine. Select a
dozen dariole molds, moisten them in cold water, baste them with the aspic,
and, when cold, garnish the bottoms handsomely with a pepper and truffle.
Put in another layer of aspic, which must be cold, but not thick; on top
of this place a slice of pate-de-foie-gras, cover them carefully with the
aspic, filling the mold to the top. Stand these away over night. Serve
on crisp lettuce leaves, and pass with them a mayonnaise. These are the
handsomest of all the cold aspic dishes.

A single large mold may be used for ball suppers or large receptions. To
serve, cut it into slices, and pass mayonnaise of celery.

This will serve twelve persons.


BONED TURKEY

Turkey is boned precisely the same as you bone a "galantine" of chicken.
Use for the stuffing:

     2 chickens
     1 pound of sausage meat
     1 pound of veal
     3 truffles
     1 can of mushrooms
     1 pound of ham

Take six hours to cook the turkey. When cold put it in a boned turkey mold
that has been garnished, and fill with aspic.

Cut in very thin slices to serve thirty persons.


BONED QUAIL

Purchase twenty-four quails. Split them down the back and remove the bones,
keeping your knife close to the bone. Do not break the skin nor tear the
flesh. Spread them out, skin side down, on a board and stuff them with the
seasoned sausage meat. Put them into shape, sew them down the back, cover
the breast of each with a slice of bacon, put them in a baking pan, add a
half pint of hot stock, and bake in a quick oven forty minutes, dusting
with pepper and basting frequently. When cold, remove the string from the
back.

For a dozen quails use:

     1 box of gelatin
     1 quart of milk
     1 tablespoonful of grated onion
     2 truffles
     4 level tablespoonfuls of butter
     4 level tablespoonfuls of flour
     2 teaspoonfuls of salt
     1 saltspoonful of white pepper

Soak the gelatin in the milk a half hour. Rub the butter and flour
together, then add the milk and gelatin, stir until boiling, and add all
the seasoning and strain. Stand aside until cool, but not thick. Place the
birds on a tin sheet or a large platter, and baste them with this cold
white sauce. As soon as the first basting has hardened, baste them again.
This time decorate the breasts with the truffles cut into fancy shapes.
To serve, arrange them around a large mound of mayonnaise of celery. Use
either a meat platter, or two round chop dishes. Have the breasts of the
birds down, and the back slightly pressed into the salad. In between each
bird put a pretty bunch of curly parsley, and garnish the top of the mound
with Spanish peppers cut into strips. Serve one to each person.




SALADS

Salads play a most important part in all conventional suppers. Chicken,
lobster, crab, duck, tongue, and lamb salad take the place of other meats,
although for a large supper there is no objection to serving a meat salad
following a hot course. If one can make a good mayonnaise dressing, salads
are the easiest of all refreshments, and are most acceptable to the guests.


MAYONNAISE

Put the yolks of three eggs in a clean cold dish, beat slightly and add
slowly, almost drop by drop, a half pint or more of salad oil. After adding
the first half pint, add a half teaspoonful of vinegar now and then to
prevent breaking. You may add a quart of oil, if you like; you may serve it
plain, or stir in at the last moment stiffly whipped cream. One quart of
mayonnaise will hold one quart of whipped cream. For light colored salads,
as sweetbread and Waldorf, it is well to use the whipped cream slightly
colored with a drop of vegetable green.


SAUCE TARTAR

Add to a half pint of mayonnaise dressing a tablespoonful of chopped
gherkin, the same of chopped parsley, four chopped olives and a
tablespoonful of capers.


SAUCE SUEDOISE

   1/2 pint of mayonnaise
   1/2 pint of cream
     2 tablespoonfuls of finely grated horseradish

Whip the cream and drain it, then stir it carefully into the mayonnaise,
and at last add the horseradish. This sauce is appropriate to serve with
boned partridges or quail, and is also nice to serve with mixed cold meats.


FRENCH DRESSING

Put eight tablespoonfuls of oil in a bowl, add a half teaspoonful of salt,
and a piece of ice the size of an egg. Work the ice with the oil until the
salt is thoroughly dissolved, then add a tablespoonful of tarragon vinegar
and a drop of Tabasco sauce. Remove the ice, beat rapidly until you have
a creamy dressing, and use at once. French dressing should be used over
cucumber or tomato molds, and is nice with fish or chicken mousse and East
Indian Salad.


CUCUMBER MOLDS

     2 good sized cucumbers
   1/2 box of gelatin
     1 pint of chicken stock
     1 teaspoonful of salt
     1 tablespoonful of onion juice
     1 saltspoonful of pepper
       The juice of one lemon

Peel and grate the cucumbers. Add the gelatin to the stock, soak for twenty
minutes, bring to a boil and add the seasoning; then stir in the drained
cucumber. Turn into small round timbale cups and stand aside to harden.
Serve with any cold fish dish, as cold boiled slice of halibut, or fish in
aspic. These are nice for Sunday night supper with broiled sardines.


TOMATO MOLDS

     1 can of tomatoes
     1 box of gelatin
     1 onion
     1 saltspoonful of celery seed
     1 bay leaf
     1 blade of mace
     2 tablespoonfuls of tarragon vinegar
     1 teaspoonful of paprika
     2 teaspoonfuls of salt

Cover the gelatin with a cupful of cold water to soak for fifteen minutes.
Add all the seasoning to the tomatoes, bring to boiling point, add the
gelatin, and strain. Turn into twelve small tomato molds and stand aside to
harden. Serve with mayonnaise dressing as an accompaniment to boned chicken
or turkey, or chicken pate, or alone, with mayonnaise, as a complete salad.
Chopped celery, a little cold cooked meat or nuts may be added, when the
molds are to be served as a salad. With this addition, one half the recipe
will serve twelve persons.


CRABS RAVIGOT

Purchase as many crab shells as you have people to serve. To each six allow
a pint of crab flakes. If you buy the crabs fresh, twelve crabs will serve
six people. Squeeze over the flakes the juice of one lemon, add a half
teaspoonful of salt and a dash of Tabasco. Fill the meat loosely into the
shells, place each shell on a pretty paper doily on a plate, and spread
over a thick layer of mayonnaise dressing, with which you have mixed a
tablespoonful of chopped parsley, a tablespoonful of tarragon leaves, a
tablespoonful of chopped onion or shallot, and a tablespoonful of green
chives.


CHICKEN SALAD

Cut cold boiled chicken into dice, add an equal quantity of tender celery,
season with salt, pepper and lemon juice, mix with mayonnaise dressing, and
serve on lettuce leaves.

A four pound chicken, and six heads of tender celery, three heads of
lettuce, a half pint of whipped cream, and one pint of mayonnaise, will
serve fifteen persons.


LOBSTER SALAD

Cut cold boiled lobster into cubes of an inch, mix with mayonnaise dressing
and serve on lettuce leaves.

One three-pound lobster will serve six persons.


CRAB SALAD

Season crab flakes with salt, pepper and lemon juice, mix them with
mayonnaise dressing, and serve on lettuce leaves, garnished with cress.

One pint of flakes will serve six persons.


TONGUE SALAD

Cut fresh-cooked beef's tongue or calf's tongue into dice. Have ready
peeled perfectly round smooth tomatoes, take out the core and scoop out
the seeds. Fill each tomato with the cubes of tongue, sprinkle over a
teaspoonful of lemon juice and a little salt and pepper. Stand these on
nests of lettuce leaves, put on top of each a large tablespoonful of
mayonnaise. Dust thickly with paprika and serve one to each person.


LAMB SALAD

Cut cold boiled lamb into dice, mix with it half the quantity of freshly
cooked green peas or canned peas. Add a half can of mushrooms, chopped
fine, salt, pepper and lemon juice. Mix with mayonnaise dressing and serve
on lettuce leaves, garnished with large sprigs of mint. Cap the top of the
dish with a good sized sprig of fresh mint, and sprinkle capers all over
the salad.

A nice plain lamb salad is made by mixing left-over cold lamb with
mayonnaise; serve on lettuce leaves and garnish with chopped mint.

A quart will serve ten persons.


TOMATOES EN SURPRISE

This is one of the nicest of the salads for a simple card party. It takes
the place of both vegetables and meat, and with brown bread and nut
sandwiches as an accompaniment, is very attractive. Peel the tomatoes, cut
off the stem end and scoop out the core and seeds. Fill the tomatoes with
either crab flakes, chopped lobster, canned salmon, or sardines. Squeeze
over a little lemon juice, and dust with salt and pepper. Turn them
upside down on a nest of lettuce leaves, and cover the tomato with creamy
mayonnaise.


SWEETBREAD SALAD

     2 pairs of sweetbreads
     4 ounces of almonds
     4 ounces of pecan meats
     2 ounces of shelled Brazilian nuts
     2 Spanish peppers
   1/2 can of mushrooms
     2 heads of celery
     2 heads of lettuce
     1 pint of mayonnaise
     1 pint of cream
     1 can of French peas

This is the most elaborate of all salads, is palatable and comparatively
wholesome. Put the sweetbreads into boiling water, add a tablespoonful of
vinegar, and simmer gently for one hour. When cold, remove the membrane and
pick the sweetbreads apart. Put them in a bowl, cover them with an onion,
sliced, and squeeze over the juice of a lemon; cover the bowl and stand it
aside over night. Blanch and chop the almonds, and chop the pecans. Remove
the onion from the sweetbreads, mix in the nuts, add the white portions of
the celery, cut the size of the sweetbreads. Add the mushrooms, sliced, two
teaspoonfuls of salt, a saltspoonful of white pepper and a saltspoonful
of paprika. Add the cream, whipped, to the mayonnaise, and mix a portion
of it with the sweetbreads and celery. Have a round shallow salad bowl
lined with the lettuce leaves, turn in the centre the sweetbread salad and
cover it over with the remaining quantity of mayonnaise. Put the peas in
a ring around the base of the salad, and cap the top with the yolk of a
hard-boiled egg. Cut the white of the egg into eighths and press them
upside down around the yolk, forming a sort of a daisy. Cut the Spanish
peppers into rings and arrange them just above the peas. Put here and there
around the base, above the peas, ripe or green olives, and send to the
table.

This will serve at supper or luncheon ten persons.


ROAST BEEF SALAD

For impromptu evening affairs any cold left-over meat may be utilized in
a salad. Beef, mutton and tongue are usually served with French dressing,
seasoned with tomato catsup. Cut the meat into dice, season with salt and
pepper, dish them on lettuce, or they may be mixed in the winter with
chopped celery or chopped crisp cabbage, and basted with French dressing,
seasoned with two or three tablespoonfuls of tomato catsup for beef, mint
sauce, or a drop of Tabasco Sauce for mutton, a little Worcestershire Sauce
for tongue.

A quart will serve ten persons.


EAST INDIAN SALAD

This is purely a vegetable salad; it is exceedingly nice for a simple
evening affair. Shave sufficient cabbage to make a pint, soak it in cold
water for one hour, changing the water once or twice. Cover a half box of
gelatin with a half cupful of cold water to soak for a half hour. Put a
half can of tomatoes in a saucepan, add one onion, chopped, a teaspoonful
of salt, a saltspoonful of pepper and the juice of a lemon, or two
tablespoonfuls of vinegar. Bring to boiling point, and add the gelatin.
Cover the bottom of a large melon mold with finely chopped celery or cooked
carrots, put on top of this a few drops of onion juice, then a thin layer
of cabbage, a dusting of salt and pepper, then a goodly quantity of India
relish; cover this over with chopped nuts, pecans, hickory or peanuts, then
another layer of celery, and so continue until the mold is full, seasoning
the layers with salt and pepper. Have the last layer chopped celery. Strain
over this the tomato aspic, which should be cold, but not thick, and stand
aside for four or five hours. Serve plain, or garnished with lettuce leaves
or cress.

This will serve twelve persons.


POTATO SALAD

Fancy potato salad may be served for an evening affair with an
accompaniment of cold tongue, or it may be garnished with hard-boiled
eggs and form the entire course. Serve with it brown bread and butter and
coffee.

     4 potatoes
     8 tablespoonfuls of olive oil
     2 tablespoonfuls of cream
     2 tablespoonfuls of tarragon vinegar
     1 level teaspoonful of salt
     1 saltspoonful of pepper

Wash the potatoes and boil them with skins on. The moment they are done,
drain the water, dry and peel. Put the oil, salt, pepper and vinegar in
a bowl, beat rapidly until thoroughly mixed, and then add one good sized
onion, sliced very thin, or use two tablespoonfuls of grated onion. Put in
the hot potatoes, sliced, toss them a moment, and if you have it, sprinkle
over two tablespoonfuls of vinegar from pickled walnuts, or a tablespoonful
of mushroom catsup. Stand aside to cool. When ready to serve, turn on to a
cold platter, garnish with chopped parsley, and, if you have them, chopped
pickled beets.

This is sufficient for six persons.


FRENCH POTATO SALAD

Moisten a teaspoonful of cornstarch in four tablespoonfuls of milk, add
two tablespoonfuls of cream and stir over hot water until thick; then add
gradually six tablespoonfuls of olive oil, a teaspoonful of French made
mustard, a level teaspoonful of salt and a saltspoonful of pepper. Boil
four potatoes, cut them into blocks, and, when nearly cold, mix them with
this dressing, and stand aside until very cold. Serve with a garnish of
chopped celery or lettuce leaves.

This will serve six persons.


MACEDOINE SALAD

A mixture of vegetables, peas, beans, carrots, turnips, can be purchased,
canned, at any grocery store. Drain, wash them in cold water, dish them
on a bed of shaved cabbage or lettuce leaves, and cover them with French
dressing. All these vegetables may be cooked at home and used cold. String
beans garnished with carrots make an excellent salad.


BANANA SALAD

For this use the red bananas. Roll them out of the skin rather than strip
the skin from them, and cut them into slices a half inch thick. Cover the
bottom of your salad bowl with crisp lettuce leaves, then put over the
bananas, allowing one banana to each two persons. Squeeze over the juice of
a lemon, and, when ready to serve, baste with French dressing.


APPLE AND NUT SALAD

     4 tart apples
     1 cupful of pecan meats
    24 blanched almonds
     2 sweet Spanish peppers
       The rule for French dressing

Peel the apples, cut them into dice, squeeze over the juice of one or two
lemons, and stand them aside until wanted. The lemon juice will prevent
discoloration. Chop the nuts. At serving time line the salad bowl with
a layer of chopped celery or cabbage or lettuce leaves, then a layer of
apples, nuts, celery, apples and nuts. Baste with the French dressing, and,
if you have them, garnish with the sweet peppers cut into strips, and use
at once.

This, using a pint of chopped cabbage or celery, will serve six persons.


CANTALOUPE SALAD

This is the newest and most sightly of salads. Arrange crisp lettuce or
Romaine leaves on individual plates. Cut a cold ripe cantaloupe into
halves, take out the seeds, and with a large vegetable scoop or teaspoon
scoop out balls or egg-shaped pieces. Heap a half dozen of these on the
lettuce leaves, and, at serving time, baste them well with French dressing,
and serve. Watermelon may be substituted for cantaloupe.




SANDWICHES


Sandwiches may be made from thin white bread, or whole wheat bread, or
Boston brown bread, or nut bread. A nut loaf is easily made at short
notice, and needs only butter to make an excellent sandwich. An endless
variety of sandwiches may be made from materials always at hand.

For CHEESE SANDWICHES: Grind or mash common American cheese, add a
palatable seasoning of tomato catsup, Worcestershire sauce, and a little
melted butter. A teaspoonful of these will be sufficient for a quarter of
a pound of cheese. Put this between thin slices of unbuttered bread. If
a large quantity of sandwiches is to be made, beat the butter to a cream
before using it.

MEATS: All sorts of meats, just a little left over, may be chopped,
seasoned and utilized for sandwiches. If the meat is slightly moistened
with a little olive oil, cream or melted butter, and the sandwiches are
wrapped in a damp cloth, as soon as made, and closed in a tin bread box,
they will keep nicely for several hours.

On a warm day put a few moist lettuce leaves on top of the sandwiches,
under the cloth, and put the box in a cold place.

CANNED SALMON, SARDINES, or BOILED SALT COD, pounded and nicely seasoned
with oil and lemon juice, or mayonnaise, make nice sandwiches to serve with
molded tomato jelly, and coffee, for a "winter evening." They are quite
enough with coffee alone in an emergency.

NUT SANDWICHES are made by putting chopped nuts or nut butter between thin
slices of buttered bread, or crackers.

SWEET SANDWICHES are made by putting a mixture of chopped fruits between
thin slices of buttered bread. The fruits best suited for sandwiches are
dates, raisins, candied ginger and cherries, and washed figs. These may be
used separately or blended, using less ginger than other fruits. A nice
filling may be made from a half pound of dates, an ounce of ginger, and ten
cents' worth of roasted peanuts, or a quarter of a pound of pecans. Put
these through a meat chopper, add the juice of an orange, and pack the
mixture in jelly tumblers. Keep in a cold place. This will keep a month in
winter, and equally long in a refrigerator in summer.

Sweet sandwiches are usually cut into "fingers," or into rounds with an
ordinary biscuit cutter.

HONOLULU SANDWICHES are made by rubbing one roll of Neufchatel cheese with
a half cupful of grated apple, two sweet Spanish peppers, and twenty-four
blanched and chopped almonds. Add salt and a drop of Tabasco sauce. Spread
between thin slices of unbuttered bread.

JELLY OR CANNED FRUIT SANDWICHES are made by spreading jelly or mashed
fruit, drained, on a very thin slice of buttered bread. Trim off the crusts
and roll quickly. Tie with baby ribbon, or press it firmly together. These
are usually served with chocolate or tea.

CHICKEN SALAD OR CELERY MAYONNAISE SANDWICHES are usually served with
coffee, and can be made quickly by mixing any left-over chicken, or tender
white celery, with mayonnaise, and putting the mixture between thin slices
of buttered bread. A lettuce leaf on the bread first holds the salad
nicely. One may use two lettuce leaves if necessary.


NUT BREAD

     2 cupfuls of flour
   1/2 cupful of chopped nuts
     2 teaspoonfuls of baking powder
     1 cupful of milk
     1 egg
     2 tablespoonfuls of sugar
   1/2 teaspoonful of salt

Sift the salt, baking powder and flour together, add and mix in the nuts
and sugar. Beat the egg, add the milk, and stir these in the flour. Mix
well, and turn it in a greased bread pan. Cover, and allow it to stand
fifteen minutes. Bake in a moderately quick oven a half hour. Pecans,
hickory nuts, peanuts, or English walnuts may be used.

Use the next day after it is baked. Cut thin, butter lightly, and press two
slices together. Serve whole, or cut into halves. Do not remove the crusts.




SUGGESTIONS FOR CHURCH SUPPERS


NUT MEAT ROLL

     1 pound of chopped beef
     1 quart of roasted peanuts in shells
     1 teaspoonful of salt
     1 saltspoonful of pepper
     3 shredded wheat biscuits
     2 eggs
     1 tablespoonful onion juice
     1 tablespoonful of parsley

Shell and chop the peanuts, mix them with the meat, and add the shredded
wheat rubbed fine; salt, pepper, parsley, chopped, and onion juice. Mix
well. Beat the egg slightly, add three tablespoonfuls of water, and mix
this into the meat. Form in a roll about eight inches long, roll in oiled
paper, place it in a baking pan, add a half cupful of water to the pan and
bake in a moderate oven three-quarters of an hour. Remove the paper and
stand aside to cool. Serve in thin slices with either tomato or potato
salad.

This will serve eight persons at a cost of about four cents each.


JELLIED VEAL

     3 knuckles of veal
     4 onions
     1 carrot
     3 teaspoonfuls of salt
     8 tablespoonfuls of vinegar
     6 gherkins
     1 teaspoonful of black pepper

Wash the knuckles, remove the meat and cut it in pieces. Put the bones in a
kettle, the meat on top, and pour over six quarts of cold water. Bring to a
boil, skim, and simmer gently two hours. Add the onion sliced, the carrot
chopped, salt and pepper, and simmer one hour longer. Drain in a colander.
Dip long molds, or ordinary bread pans, in cold water, cover the bottom
with slices of hard boiled eggs, put the meat in bits on top of this,
seasoning it with a little salt. Slice the gherkins and put them in layers
between the meat. Strain the liquid, add the vinegar, and pour it over the
meat. There should be just enough to cover it nicely. If there is more
than this, boil it down before adding vinegar. Stand aside over night.
When cold, dip the mold a second in boiling water, and turn the jelly in a
platter. Serve cut in slices, with either a nice cold slaw, or cabbage and
celery salad. Jellied beef is made the same, substituting a leg or shin of
beef.

This will cost about seventy five cents, and will make twenty-five to
thirty slices.


BAGGED VEAL

     2 pounds of lean ham
     4 pounds of veal cutlet
     3 shredded wheat biscuits
     2 eggs
     2 onions
     1 teaspoonful of powdered sage
   1/2 teaspoonful of allspice
     1 teaspoonful of salt
   1/2 teaspoonful of black pepper

Put the meat, raw, through a meat chopper, add the biscuits crumbed, the
onions grated, and all the seasonings. Work it well with the hands, and mix
in the eggs, slightly beaten. Pack the mixture in clean salt bags or bags
about that size, plunge them in a kettle of boiling water, boil rapidly ten
minutes, and simmer three hours. When cool, turn the bags wrong side out
off the meat. Serve sliced like summer sausage.

This will cost one and a half dollars, and will serve twenty five persons.


A SPANISH STEW FOR ONE HUNDRED PERSONS

    25 pounds of round of beef
     6 sweet peppers, or
     1 can of Spanish pimentos
    12 sweet turnips
   1/2 bottle of Worcestershire sauce
     1 cupful of flour
     1 pound of suet
    10 large onions
     3 gallon cans of peas
    12 carrots
     1 jar of beef extract
     4 tablespoonfuls of salt
     4 tablespoonfuls of cornstarch
   1/4 pound of butter

Put the suet into a large kettle or in two smaller ones; try it out and
remove the crackling. Add to the hot fat the onions and peppers chopped
fine. Shake until they are well cooked and slightly browned. Add the
meat cut into cubes of one inch, cover the kettles and cook a half hour,
stirring now and then. Dissolve the beef extract in three gallons of hot
water, pour it over the meat, and simmer for two hours. Add the carrots
and turnips cut into dice, and more water if necessary, and cook one hour
longer. Add the flour and cornstarch moistened in cold water, and all the
seasonings. Stir and boil ten minutes, add the peas, drained, and serve.
This is nice garnished with small hot milk biscuits. Taste before serving
it, to see if you have added sufficient salt.


VEAL ROLL

     4 pounds of lean veal
     3 shredded wheat biscuits
     1 teaspoonful of salt
   1/2 teaspoonful of sage
   1/2 pound of lean ham
     2 eggs
     1 tablespoonful of parsley
     1 saltspoonful of pepper

Put the veal and ham through a meat chopper, add all the seasonings, and
the biscuits rubbed fine. Mix thoroughly, add the egg slightly beaten, mix
again, and form into a roll three inches in diameter. Roll in oiled paper,
place in a baking pan, cover the bottom of the pan with hot water, add a
slice of onion, and, if you have it, a little chopped celery tops. Bake
slowly one and a half hours, basting over the paper every fifteen minutes.
When done, remove the paper, and put in a cold place. Serve in thin slices
with tomato jelly salad.

This will cost about one dollar and will serve eighteen persons.


MAN-OF-WAR SALAD

For twenty-five persons, chop sufficient hard white cabbage to make two
quarts. Cover it with cold water, let it soak for an hour, and then wash
it through several cold waters, and dry it in a towel. Cover three boxes
of gelatin with a pint of cold water to soak a half hour. Open three cans
of tomatoes, put them in a saucepan with four chopped onions, a cupful of
chopped celery tops, if you have them, bring to a boil, add the juice of
a lemon, a level tablespoonful of salt, ten drops of Tabasco sauce, the
juice of a lemon, or two tablespoonfuls of vinegar, and the gelatin. Stir
a moment, and press through a sieve. Dip bread pans or melon molds in cold
water, put in a layer of cabbage, then a very thin layer of Indian relish,
then cabbage, and so continue until the molds are filled. Pour over the
tomato jelly, cold, and stand aside over night. Serve in slices with cooked
or French dressing.


COOKED DRESSING

Put a pint of milk over the fire in a double boiler, add three level
tablespoonfuls of cornstarch moistened in a little cold milk. Cook until
thick and smooth. Take from the fire, add the beaten yolks of four eggs,
and work in slowly two tablespoonfuls of butter. Add a teaspoonful of salt
and a saltspoonful of pepper. When cool add the juice of a lemon or four
tablespoonfuls of vinegar. Fold in carefully the well-beaten whites of the
eggs, and stand aside until very cold.


GRANDMOTHER'S POTATO SALAD

Boil ten large potatoes in their jackets. Peel them and, when cool, cut
eight into dice. Peel and mash the remaining two while hot; add to them a
quarter pound of sweet butter, four tablespoonfuls of grated onion, two
teaspoonfuls of salt, a dash of cayenne, two drops of Tabasco sauce, and
press through a fine sieve. Hard boil two eggs; rub the yolks to a paste,
and add two raw yolks. When smooth, add to these gradually the potato
mixture. Thin to the consistency of good mayonnaise, with vinegar. At
serving time mix the potato blocks and one can of drained peas with the
dressing, being very careful not to break them. Dish on lettuce leaves,
and garnish with chopped red beets, or, better, chopped celery. This is an
excellent cheap salad, and will serve fifteen persons.


SALMON PUDDING

Remove the bone, skin and oil from two pound cans of salmon. Boil together
two cupfuls of white bread crumbs and one cupful of milk. Take from
the fire, and add one cupful of boiled rice, a teaspoonful of salt, a
saltspoonful of pepper, a teaspoonful of onion juice, and four eggs
slightly beaten. Mix and work in the fish. Press the whole through a
colander, and pack it at once into a mold. Cover and steam three-quarters
of an hour. Serve hot with cream sauce. This will serve twelve persons.


NUT CAKE

At suppers where the yolks of eggs are used for mayonnaise or cooked
dressing, the whites accumulate and are lost if not used in some white
cake.

   1/2 cupful of butter
     2 cupfuls of flour
 1-1/2 cupfuls of sugar
   3/4 cupful  of water
     1 cupful of English walnut or hickory nut meats
     2 rounding teaspoonfuls of baking powder
       Whites of four eggs

Cream the butter, add the water and flour, alternately, beating all the
while. Beat the whites, add half of them to the mixture, then all the nuts,
chopped, then the baking powder, dry, and beat well. Fold in the remaining
whites. Bake in a round cake pan in a moderate oven three-quarters of an
hour. When cool, ice the top and decorate it with nut meats.


SCONES FOR TWENTY-FIVE PERSONS

Sift three quarts of flour with six rounding teaspoonfuls of baking powder
and two of salt. Beat, without separating, three eggs. Rub into the flour a
quarter of a pound of butter, or three tablespoonfuls of snowdrift. Add to
the eggs one quart and a half of milk, and stir this into the flour. Mix
quickly and drop by spoonfuls in greased baking pans, and bake fifteen
minutes in a quick oven. Serve at once. These are better and more easily
made than biscuits.


POOR MAN'S FRUIT CAKE

 3-1/2 cupfuls of flour
     1 cupful of brown sugar
   1/2 cupful of New Orleans molasses
     1 pound of seeded raisins
     1 cupful of sour milk
   1/2 cupful of butter
     1 teaspoonful of cinnamon
     1 teaspoonful of allspice
     1 teaspoonful of soda

Cut the raisins into halves and flour them with four tablespoonfuls of the
flour. Dissolve the soda in a tablespoonful of water, add it to the thick
sour milk, beat a minute, add the molasses, beat again, add the butter,
melted carefully, and stir in the flour; add the spices, and beat well.
Stir in the raisins, and turn into a greased bread pan. Bake in a
_moderate_ oven one hour. When done, turn from the pan, baste with a syrup,
made by boiling four tablespoonfuls of sugar with three of water, and add
two teaspoonfuls of currant or grape jelly. Shut the cake in a tin box for
a week or more. If made well this is moist and rich at very little cost.


BANANA LAYER

   1/4 cupful of butter
     1 cupful of sugar
   2/3 cupful of water
     2 cupfuls of flour
     2 rounding teaspoonfuls of baking powder
       Whites of four eggs

Put together the same as Ice Cream Cake, and bake in three layers. When
cold, put together with Banana Filling.


BANANA FILLING

Boil together one cupful of sugar and a half cupful of water until they
spin a heavy thread, and pour slowly, beating all the while, into the
well-beaten whites of two eggs. Beat until rather stiff and cold. When the
cakes are cold, spread one-third of this filling over one cake, cover with
thin slices of red bananas, put on another cake, on this another third of
filling and bananas, and the remaining cake; cover this with the remaining
filling, and dust thickly with chopped nuts. Do not let this stand too
long, or the filling will absorb moisture from the bananas and run down the
cake.


ICE CREAM CAKE

 1-1/2 cupfuls of sugar
 2-1/2 cupfuls of flour
   1/4 cupful of butter
     1 cupful of water
     2 rounding teaspoonfuls of baking powder
       Whites of five eggs

Cream the butter, adding slowly the sugar. Sift the flour with the baking
powder. Add the water and flour alternately to the sugar mixture, and
beat well. Fold in the well-beaten whites, and bake in three layers. Put
together with a soft icing made from the whites of two eggs.


FRUIT JELLY

Dip a fancy mold into cold water, fill it half full of mixed chopped
candied fruits, or use dates, figs and bananas chopped. Fill the mold with
a well-made lemon or orange gelatin. Serve plain, or with whipped cream.


MOCK EGGS

   1/2 box of gelatin
     1 can pared apricots
     1 cupful of sugar
     1 pint of water
       Whites of three eggs
       Juice of three lemons

Cover the gelatin with a half cupful of cold water to soak for a half hour,
add the sugar and the water boiling; stir until the gelatin is dissolved;
add the lemon juice, strain, and cool until congealed but not too hard. Add
the unbeaten whites of eggs, stand the bowl in a pan of cracked ice or cold
water, and beat until the whole mass is as white as snow. Pour into ramekin
dishes or paper cases, press a half apricot, rounding side up, in the
centre, and stand aside in a cold place.

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
