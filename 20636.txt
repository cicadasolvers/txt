Having been, for several years, engaged in the establishment of a
Museum in Poughkeepsie, I have, by extensive travel and research, and
by the kindness of many of my fellow-citizens in Dutchess county and
elsewhere, obtained numerous objects, not only curious in themselves,
but valuable as materials for history. Among these are two manuscript
Journals, kept by common soldiers, each during a single campaign, and
written at periods seventeen years apart. One of these soldiers served
in a campaign of the conflict known as the FRENCH AND INDIAN WAR,
which commenced a hundred years ago; the other soldier assisted in the
siege of Boston, by the American army, in 1775 and 1776. Believing
that a faithful transcript of those Journals, given _verbatim et
literatim_, as recorded by the actors themselves, might have an
interest for American readers, as exhibiting the every-day life of a
common soldier in those wars which led to the founding of our
republic, I have yielded to the solicitations of friends, and the
dictates of my own judgment and feelings, and in the following pages
present to the public faithful copies of those diaries.

Perceiving that much of the intrinsic value of these Journals would
consist in a proper understanding of the historical facts to which
allusions are made in them, I prevailed upon Mr. LOSSING, the
well-known author of the "_Pictorial Field-Book of the Revolution_" to
illustrate and elucidate these diaries by explanatory notes. His name
is a sufficient guaranty for their accuracy and general usefulness;
and I flatter myself that this little volume will not only amuse, but
edify, and that the useful objects aimed at in its publication will be
fully attained. With this hope, it is submitted to my fellow-citizens.

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.


The conflict known in America as the _French and Indian War_, and in
Europe as the _Seven Years' War_, originated in disputes between the
French and English colonists, in the New World, concerning territorial
limits. For a century the colonies of the two nations had been
gradually expanding and increasing in importance. The English, more
than a million in number, occupied the seaboard from the Penobscot to
the St. Mary's, a thousand miles in extent; all eastward of the great
ranges of the Alleganies, and far northward toward the St. Lawrence.
The French, not more than a hundred thousand strong, made settlements
along the St. Lawrence, the shores of the great lakes, on the
Mississippi and its tributaries, and upon the borders of the gulf of
Mexico. They early founded Detroit, Kaskaskia, Vincennes, and New
Orleans.

The English planted agricultural colonies--the French were chiefly
engaged in traffic with the Indians. This trade, and the operations of
the Jesuit missionaries, who were usually the self-denying pioneers of
commerce in its penetration of the wilderness, gave the French great
influence over the tribes of a vast extent of country lying in the
rear of the English settlements.

The ancient quarrel between the two nations, originating far back in
the feudal ages, and kept alive by subsequent collisions, burned
vigorously in the bosoms of the respective colonists in America, where
it was continually fed by frequent hostilities on frontier ground.
They had ever regarded each other with extreme jealousy, for the prize
before them was supreme rule in the New World. The trading-posts and
missionary-stations of the French, in the far Northwest, and in the
bosom of the dark wilderness, several hundred miles distant from the
most remote settlements on the English frontier, attracted very little
attention until they formed a part of more extensive operations. But
when, after the capture of Louisburg, by the English, in 1745, the
French adopted vigorous measures for opposing the extension of British
power in America; when they built strong vessels at the foot of Lake
Ontario--made treaties of friendship with powerful Indian
tribes--strengthened their fort at the mouth of the Niagara river--and
erected a cordon of fortifications, more than sixty in number, between
Montreal and New Orleans,--the English were aroused to immediate and
effective action in defence of the territorial limits given them in
their ancient charters. By virtue of these, they claimed dominion
westward to the Pacific ocean, south of the latitude of the north
shore of Lake Erie; while the French claimed a title to all the
territory watered by the Mississippi and its tributaries, under the
more plausible plea that they had made the first explorations and
settlements in that region. The claims of the real owner--the
Indian--were lost sight of in the discussion; and it was a significant
question asked by an Indian messenger of the agent of the English
_Ohio Company_: "Where is the Indian's land? The English claim it all
on one side of the river, and the French on the other: where does the
Indian's land lie?"

The territorial question was brought to an issue when, in 1753, a
company of English traders and settlers commenced exploring the
head-waters of the Ohio. The French opposed their operations by force.
George Washington was sent by the Virginia authorities to remonstrate
with the French. It was of no avail. The English determined to oppose
force to force; and in the vicinity of the now-flourishing city of
Pittsburg, in western Pennsylvania, the "French and Indian War" began.
Provincial troops were raised, and armies came from England. Extensive
campaigns were planned, and attempts were made to expel the French
from Lake Champlain and the southern shore of Lake Ontario. Finally,
in 1758, three armies were in motion at one time against French posts
remote from each other--Louisburg, in the extreme east; Ticonderoga,
on Lake Champlain; and Fort Du Quesne, where Pittsburg now stands.
General Sir James Abercrombie commanded the expedition against
Ticonderoga, accompanied by young Lord Howe as his lieutenant. The
French were under the command of the marquis Montcalm, who was killed
at Quebec the following year. The English and provincial troops
rendezvoused at the head of Lake George, went down that sheet of
water, attacked Ticonderoga, and were repulsed with great loss. It was
this portion of that campaign in which the soldier served who kept the
Journal given in the succeeding pages. It is a graphic outline
picture, in few and simple words, of the daily life of a common
soldier at that time.

During the campaign of 1759, Quebec was captured by the army under
Wolfe; Lord Amherst, more successful than Abercrombie, drove the
French from Lake Champlain; Sir William Johnson captured Fort Niagara;
and all Canada was in virtual possession of the English, except
Montreal. That fell early in the Autumn of 1760; and the struggle for
supremacy in America, between the French and English, was ended for
ever.

                   east bank of the Hudson, about fifty miles north
                   of Albany. The fort was built by General Lyman, of
                   Connecticut, in 1755, while that officer was
                   encamped there with about six thousand troops,
                   awaiting the arrival of General William Johnson,
                   the commander-in-chief of the expedition against
                   the French at Ticonderoga and Crown Point. A
                   portion of the site of the fort is now (1854)
                   occupied by the flourishing village of Fort Edward.
                   Some of the embankments are yet visible near the
                   river. It was near this fort that Jane McCrea was

                   fought near there, in 1777, and is sometimes known
                   as the battle of Stillwater. Opposite the mouth of

                   on the north side. On the plain, in front of the
                   village of Schuylerville, was a regular
                   quadrangular fortification, with bastions, called
                   Fort Hardy. It was erected in 1756, and named in

                   Major (afterward General) Putnam was here surprised
                   by a party of Indians, and boldly descended the
                   rapids in a canoe, and escaped. It was a feat they

                   It is so named because a party of soldiers from the
                   garrison, in 1759, went there to fish, were
                   surprised by the Indians, and nine were killed and

                   nobly, and was but little noticed. Johnson was
                   unfit for his station, but being a nephew of Sir
                   Peter Warren, then a popular English admiral, he
                   received the honor of knighthood, and the sum of
                   twenty thousand dollars, for his services in that
                   campaign! General Lyman served with distinction
                   until the close of the campaign in 1760, and in
                   1762 commanded the American forces sent against
                   Havana. He was in England about eleven years, and,
                   after his return, went with his family to the
                   Mississippi, where he died in 1788.]

                   [Footnote 31: Colonel David Wooster, of
                   Connecticut, the eminent general of the Revolution,
                   who was killed at Ridgefield, while engaged in the
                   pursuit of Tryon, after the burning of Danbury, in
                   the spring of 1777. He was born in Stratford,
                   Connecticut, in March, 1710, graduated at Yale
                   college in 1738, and soon afterward received the
                   appointment of captain of a vessel of the
                   coast-guard. He was in the expedition against
                   Louisburg in 1745. He afterward went to England,
                   where he was a favorite at the court of George II.,
                   and received the appointment of captain in the
                   regular service, under Sir William Pepperell. He
                   was promoted to a colonelcy in 1755, and rose to
                   the rank of brigadier before the close of the
                   French and Indian war. He was one of the most
                   active men in getting up the expedition against
                   Ticonderoga, in 1775, which resulted in the capture
                   of that fortress, and also Crown Point, by Colonel
                   Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold. Wooster was
                   appointed one of the first brigadiers of the
                   continental army, in 1775, and third in rank. He
                   was also appointed the first major-general of the
                   militia of his state, when organized for the War
                   for Independence; and in that capacity he was
                   employed, with Arnold, Silliman, and others, in
                   repelling British invasion in 1777. He lost his
                   life in that service. His remains were buried at
                   Danbury; and in 1854 a monument was erected over
                   his grave by his grateful countrymen, at the
                   expense of his native state.]

                   performed signal services during the greater part
                   of the French and Indian war. He was the son of an
                   Irishman, an early settler of Dunbarton, in New
                   Hampshire. He was appointed to his command in 1755,
                   and was a thorough scout. In 1759, he was sent by
                   General Amherst to destroy the Indian village of
                   St. Francis. In that expedition he suffered great
                   hardships, but was successful. He served in the
                   Cherokee war in 1761, and in 1766 was appointed
                   governor of Michilimacinac, where he was accused of
                   treason, and sent to Montreal in irons. He was
                   acquitted, went to England, and, after suffering
                   imprisonment for debt, returned to America, where
                   he remained until the Revolution broke out. He took
                   up arms for the king, and in 1777 went to England,
                   where he died. His "Journal of the French and

                   Revolutionary general. He was born in Salem,
                   Massachusetts, in January, 1718. He was a vigorous
                   lad, and in 1739 we find him cultivating land in
                   Pomfret, Connecticut, the scene of his remarkable
                   adventure in a wolf's den, so familiar to every
                   reader. He was appointed to the command of some of
                   the first troops raised in Connecticut for the
                   French and Indian war in 1755, and was an active
                   officer during the entire period of that conflict,
                   especially while in command of a corps of rangers.
                   He was ploughing in his field when the news of the
                   skirmishes at Lexington and Concord reached him. He
                   immediately started for Boston, and, at the head of
                   Connecticut troops, was active in the battle of
                   Bunker Hill. He was one of the first four
                   major-generals of the continental army appointed by
                   Congress in June, 1775, and he was constantly on
                   duty in important movements until 1779, when a
                   partial paralysis of one side of his body disabled
                   him for military service. He lived in retirement
                   after the war, and died at Brooklyn, Windham
                   county, Connecticut, on the 29th of May, 1790, at
                   the age of seventy-two years.]

                   because of signal services on the continent, was
                   promoted to the rank of major-general, the military
                   art having been his profession since boyhood. He

Wednesday 5th. This day the Army by son rise got ready for to March
and Marched of by Water, and Arived at the Saberday point[36] & stayed
their til midnight then Marched again to the first narrows & Landed
their and went down.

                   [Footnote 36: Sabbath-day Point. This is a fertile
                   little promontory, jutting out into Lake George
                   from the western shore, a few miles from the little
                   village of Hague, and surrounded by the most
                   picturesque scenery imaginable. It was so named, at
                   this time, because it was early on Sunday morning
                   that Abercrombie and his army left this place and
                   proceeded down the lake. There a small provincial
                   force had a desperate fight with a party of French
                   and Indians, in 1756, and defeated them.
                   Abercrombie's army went down the lake in batteaux
                   and whaleboats, and reached the Point just at dark.
                   Captain (afterward General) Stark relates that he
                   supped with the young lord Howe that evening, at
                   the Point, and that the nobleman made many anxious
                   inquiries about the strength of Ticonderoga, the
                   country to be traversed, &c., and, by his serious
                   demeanor, evinced a presentiment of his sad fate.
                   He was killed in a skirmish with a French scout two
                   days afterward. His body was conveyed to Albany, in
                   charge of Captain (afterward General) Philip
                   Schuyler, and buried there. He was a brother of the
                   admiral and general of that name, who commanded
                   the British naval and land forces in America in
                   1776.]

Thursday 6th. 12 A Clock at night we marched of again[37] & landed at
the 1st narrows & then we Marched on to the falls[38] within 2 miles
of the fort and there we was attackt by the Enemy[39] and the
Engagement held 1 hour and we kiled and took upwards of 2 & 50, & of
Captain Holmes Company we had 3 Men wounded. Sergent Cada Sergent

thousand strong and our men came back again to the Landing place &
Lodged their.

                   [Footnote 37: "The order of march," says Major
                   Rogers, "exhibited a splendid military show." There
                   were sixteen thousand well-armed troops. Lord Howe,
                   in a large boat, led the van of the flotilla,
                   accompanied by a guard of rangers and expert
                   boatmen. The regular troops occupied the centre,
                   and the provincials the wings. The sky was clear
                   and starry, and not a breeze ruffled the dark
                   waters as they slept quietly in the shadows of the
                   mountains. Their oars were muffled, and, so
                   silently did they move on, that not a scout upon
                   the hills observed them; and the first intimation
                   that the outposts of the enemy received of their
                   approach was the full blaze of their scarlet
                   uniforms, when, soon after sunrise, they landed and
                   pushed on toward Ticonderoga.]

                   from the foot of Lake George to Fort Ticonderoga is
                   about four miles.]

                   [Footnote 39: The English lacked suitable guides,
                   and became bewildered in the dense forest that
                   covered the land. Lord Howe was second in command,
                   and led the van, preceded by Major Putnam and a
                   scout of one hundred men, to reconnoitre. The
                   French set fire to their own outpost, and
                   retreated. Howe and Putnam dashed on through the
                   woods, and in a few minutes fell in with the French
                   advanced guard, who were also bewildered, and were
                   trying to find their way to the fort. A smart
                   skirmish ensued, and, at the first fire, Lord Howe,
                   another officer, and several privates, were killed.
                   The French were repulsed, with a loss of about
                   three hundred killed, and one hundred and forty
                   made prisoners. The English battalions were so much
                   broken, confused, and fatigued, that Abercrombie
                   ordered them back to the landing-place, where they
                   bivouacked for the night.]

Friday 7th. Majer Rogers went down to the mils and drove them of there
from & kild and took upwards of 150 & at Son down the last of the Army
marched down to the Mils and Majer putnom made a Bridge over by the
Landing place this night we lodged by the Mils.

Saturday 8th. Then marched back 2 or 3 rigiments to the Landing place
to guard & help Get up Artillira and we worked all the fore noon
onloading the Battoes and at noon we set out down to the Mils with the
Artillira & we got near the Mils and we had orders to leave the
Artillira[40] their and go back & get our arms and we went down to the
Mils of our rigiment 2 Hundred were ordered to go over on the point to
keep the French from Landing their and we stayed while next morning
son 2 hours high & when we came in all our army and Artillira was gorn
back & the Mils fired and we marched back to the Landing place and had
to secure matter of 200 Barrels of Flour & we heard the French were a
coming upon us and we stove them all and come of us as soon as we
could and about 10 Ock we sot sail and & by Son down we arrived at
Lake George[41] according to all accounts the Engagement began about
10 clock and held 10 Hours steady and we lost 3 Thousand rigulars.

                   [Footnote 40: This was Abercrombie's fatal mistake.
                   He sent an engineer to reconnoitre the fort and
                   outworks. The engineer reported the latter to be so
                   weak, in an unfinished state, as to be easily
                   carried, without artillery, by the force of English
                   bayonets. The difficulties in the way of heavy
                   cannons, in that dense forest, were very
                   formidable; and Abercrombie was willing to rely
                   upon sword and bayonet, on the strength of his
                   engineer's report. That functionary was mistaken;
                   and when the English approached the French lines,
                   they found an embankment of earth and stones, eight
                   feet in height, strongly guarded by _abatis_, or
                   felled trees, with their tops outward. The English
                   made a furious attack, cut pathways through these
                   prostrate trees, and mounted the parapet. They were
                   instantly slain, and thus scores of Britons were
                   sacrificed, by discharges of heavy cannons. When
                   two thousand men had fallen, Abercrombie sounded a
                   retreat, and the whole British army made its way to
                   the landing-place at the foot of Lake George, with
                   a loss of twenty-five hundred muskets. They went up
                   the lake to Fort William Henry, and the wounded
                   were sent to Fort Edward and to Albany. At his own
                   solicitation, Colonel Bradstreet was sent to attack
                   the French fort Frontenac, where Kingston now
                   stands, at the foot of Lake Ontario; and General
                   Stanwix proceeded to erect a fort toward the
                   head-waters of the Mohawk, where the village of
                   Rome now flourishes.]

                   William Johnson, in the autumn of 1755; and, about
                   half a mile southeast from it, Fort George was

                   mile northwest from Fort Anne village (then the
                   site of a picketed blockhouse, called Fort Anne),
                   between a party of rangers and provincials under
                   Rogers, Putnam, and Captain Dalyell, or D'Ell, and
                   about an equal number of French and Indians under
                   Molang, a famous partisan leader. The English
                   troops were marching when attacked: Putnam was in
                   front, with the provincials; Rogers was in the
                   rear, with his rangers; and D'Ell in the centre,
                   with the regulars. Molang attacked them in front,
                   and a powerful Indian rushed forward and made
                   Putnam a prisoner. The provincials were thrown into
                   great confusion, but were rallied by Lieutenant
                   Durkee, who was one of the victims of the Wyoming
                   massacre twenty years afterward. D'Ell, with Gage's
                   light infantry, behaved very gallantly, and the
                   rangers finally put the enemy to flight. The latter
                   lost about two hundred men. Colonel Prevost, then
                   in command at Fort Edward, sent out three hundred
                   men, with refreshments for the party, and all
                   arrived at Fort Edward on the 9th. This was the

                   [Footnote 60: The Indian who seized Putnam tied him
                   to a tree, and for a time he was exposed to the
                   cross-fire of the combatants. His garments were
                   riddled by bullets, but, strange to say, not one
                   touched his person. He was carried away in the
                   retreat, his wrists tightly bound with cords. The
                   Indians rejoiced over the capture of their great
                   enemy, and he was doomed to the torture. In the
                   deep forest he was stripped naked, bound to a
                   sapling, wood was piled high around him, the
                   death-songs of the savages were chanted, and the
                   torch was applied. Just then a heavy shower of rain
                   almost extinguished the flames. They were again
                   bursting forth with fiercer intensity, when a
                   French officer, informed of what was going on,
                   darted through the crowd of yelling savages, and
                   released the prisoner. He was delivered to Montcalm
                   at Ticonderoga, then sent to Montreal, and, after
                   being treated kindly, was exchanged for a prisoner
                   taken by Colonel Bradstreet at Frontenac.]

                   before the occurrences here narrated took place. It
                   was a strong blockhouse of logs, with portholes for
                   cannon and loopholes for musketry, and surrounded
                   by a picket of pine-saplings. When the writer
                   visited the spot in 1848, he dug up the part of one
                   of the pickets yet remaining in the earth, and, on
                   splitting it, it emitted the pleasant odor of a
                   fresh pine-log, though ninety years had elapsed
                   since it was placed there. This fort was near the
                   bank of Wood creek, about eleven miles from the
                   head of Lake Champlain, at the village of
                   Whitehall. It was in the line of Burgoyne's march
                   toward the Hudson, in 1777; and near it quite a
                   severe skirmish took place between Colonel Long, of
                   Schuyler's army, and a British detachment under
                   Colonel Hill, on the 8th of July, the day after
                   Ticonderoga was abandoned to the enemy. Victory was
                   almost within the grasp of Colonel Long, when his
                   ammunition failed, and he was compelled to
                   retreat.]

  NOTE.--The soldiers had, necessarily, a great deal of leisure
  during permanent camp-duties, and contrived various ways to amuse
  themselves, and "kill time." In those days the common soldiers
  carried their powder in the horns of cows or oxen, and many
  amused themselves by ornamenting them by a skilful use of their
  knives. Below is a specimen of one of these ornamented horns,
  prepared during the campaign of 1758. Upon it is neatly cut the
  figure of a fortified building (a part of which is seen in the
  engraving), the owner's name, and a verse, as follows:--

  "Eluathan Ives His Horn, Made at Lake George, September ye 22d,
     Ad. 1758.

                    "I, powder, With My Brother Baul
                    A Hero like do Conquer All.
                    Steel not this Horn For Fear of Shame
                    For on it is the Oners name.
                    The Roos is Red, the Grass is Green--
                    The Days Are past Which I Have Seen"

A JOURNAL FOR 1775, A. D.




INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.


The following is a literal transcript of a Journal kept by a common
soldier named SAMUEL HAWS, of Wrentham, Massachusetts, who appears to
have been one of the _minute-men_, organized toward the close of 1774
and early in 1775. At that time there were about three thousand
British troops in Boston, under General Thomas Gage, who was also
governor of the colony of Massachusetts. He was popularly regarded as
an oppressor; and act after act of the British government, during a
year preceding, had convinced the American people that they must
choose the alternative to submit or fight. They resolved to fight, if
necessary. During the summer of 1774, the people commenced arming, and
training themselves in military exercises; the manufacture of arms and
gunpowder was encouraged; and throughout Massachusetts, in particular,
the people were enrolled in companies, and prepared to take up arms at
a moment's warning. From this circumstance they were called
"MINUTE-MEN."

With his strong force, Gage felt quite certain that he could suppress
the threatened insurrection, and keep the people quiet. Yet he felt
uneasy concerning the gathering of ammunition and stores by the
patriots at Concord, sixteen miles from Boston; and on the night of
the 18th of April, 1775, he sent a detachment of soldiers to seize
them. They proceeded by the way of Lexington, where they arrived
at dawn of the 19th. The expedition became known, and the country was
aroused. When the British approached Lexington, they were confronted
by about seventy minute-men. A skirmish ensued: eight patriots were
killed, and several were wounded. _That was the first bloodshed of the
Revolution._ The British then went on to Concord, to seize the stores,
where they were again confronted by minute-men. Indeed, they had been
annoyed all the way by them, as they fired from behind buildings,
stone-walls, and trees. They destroyed the stores, and in a skirmish
killed several more American citizens. The country was now thoroughly
aroused, and the minute-men hastened toward Lexington and Concord from
all directions. The British found it necessary to retreat, and nothing
saved the whole troop sent out the night before from utter
destruction, but a strong reinforcement under Lord Percy. The whole
body retreated hastily to Charlestown, and across to Boston, with a
loss, in killed and wounded, of two hundred and seventy-three men.
Intelligence of the tragedy soon spread over the country, and from the
hills and valleys of New England thousands of men, armed and unarmed,
hastened toward Boston, and formed that force (of which our Journalist
was one) that, for nine months, kept the British army prisoners upon
the peninsulas of Boston and Charlestown. By common consent,
Artemas Ward, a soldier of the French and Indian war, was made
commander-in-chief, and he performed the duties of that office with
zeal until he was superseded by Washington, early in July, 1775.

regulars were a landing at Dorchester Point and that there was two
Lighters gone to Weymoth Loaded with the Kings troops but it was a
false alarm and their was nothing done.[114]

                   [Footnote 114: On Sunday morning, the 21st of May,
                   the British commander sent two sloops and an armed
                   schooner to take off a quantity of hay from Grape
                   island. They were opposed by the people who
                   gathered on the point nearest the island. These
                   finally got two vessels afloat, went to the island,
                   drove the British off, burnt eighty tons of hay,
                   and brought off many cattle. There was some severe
                   fighting during the affair. Mrs. John Adams,
                   writing to her husband, said: "You inquire who were
                   at the engagement at Grape island. I may say with
                   truth, all of Weymouth, Braintree, and Hingham, who
                   were able to bear arms.... Both your brothers were
                   there; your younger brother with his company, who
                   gained honor by their good order that day. He was
                   one of the first to venture on board a schooner, to
                   land upon the island." Mr. Adams was then in the
                   Continental Congress, at Philadelphia.]

                   from Hog and Noddle's islands, near Boston. They
                   were observed by the British, who despatched a
                   sloop, a schooner, and forty marines, to oppose
                   them. They were fired on from the vessels, and
                   quite severe skirmishing continued through the
                   night. The Americans sent for reinforcements, and,
                   at about nine o'clock at night, some three hundred
                   men and two pieces of cannon arrived, commanded by
                   General Putnam in person, and accompanied by Dr.
                   Warren as a volunteer. They compelled the British
                   to abandon their sloop, and the Americans took
                   possession of it. The British lost twenty killed
                   and fifty wounded. The Americans had none killed,
                   and only four wounded. They captured twelve swivels

                   hill, nearer Charlestown and Boston than Bunker's
                   hill. Colonel William Prescott, and not General
                   Putnam, was entrenched there, and was in command
                   during the engagement. He had been sent with a

                   to throw up a redoubt on Bunker's hill. He made a
                   mistake, and performed the work on Breed's hill.
                   The British had no suspicion of the work that went
                   on during that sultry June night, and were greatly
                   alarmed when they saw a formidable breastwork
                   overlooking their shipping in the harbor, and
                   menacing the city. During the engagement, General
                   Putnam was on Bunker's hill, urging on
                   reinforcements for Prescott. Dr. Warren, just
                   appointed major-general, joined Prescott as a
                   volunteer during the battle, and was mortally
                   wounded just as the conflict ended. It must be

                   under which the patriots had often held meetings
                   since the time of the stamp-act excitement. On that
                   account it was called "Liberty-Tree." It was a
                   noble elm, and stood at the corner of the present
                   Washington and Essex streets. On the 31st of
                   August, 1775, the British cut it down, with no
                   apparent motive but the indulgence of petty spite.
                   An eye-witness of the event says: "After a long
                   spell of laughing and grinning, sweating, swearing,
                   and foaming, with malice diabolical, they cut down
                   a tree, because it bore the name of liberty." A
                   tory soldier was killed by its fall. A poet of the
                   day wrote:--

                     "A tory soldier, on its topmost limb--
                     The Genius of the Shade looked stern at him,
                     And marked him out that same hour to dine
                     Where unsnuffed lamps burn low at Pluto's shrine.
                     Then tripped his feet from off their cautious stand:
                     Pale turned the wretch--he spread each helpless hand,
                     But spread in vain--with headlong force he fell,
                     Nor stopped descending till he stopped in hell!"]

                   to "fire upon a flag," as the phrase is when the

                   [Footnote 174: As early as July, 1775, Dr. Franklin
                   had suggested the propriety of a political
                   confederation of all the colonies, and the
                   establishment of governmental relations with
                   foreign powers, especially with France, which, it
                   was well known, hated England. In November of that
                   year, Benjamin Harrison, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas
                   Johnson, John Dickenson, and John Jay, were

                   March following, Silas Deane was appointed a
                   special agent of Congress to the court of France.
                   Rumors of such intentions appear to have reached
                   the army, according to our Journalist, as early as
                   the 24th of October, 1775.]

                   occurred. The "Essex Gazette" of the 19th said,
                   "Scarcely a gun has been fired for a fortnight." On
                   the 4th, a small fleet, under Captain Mowatt,

                   been great confusion in the matter. The army had
                   gathered around Boston from sudden impulse, and it
                   was continually changing. The excitement which had
                   brought them together had in a measure subsided,
                   and enlistments went on slowly. After a month's
                   exertions, only five thousand names were enrolled;
                   and Washington, lamenting the dearth of public
                   spirit, almost despaired. Alluding to the
                   selfishness exhibited in camp, he says: "Such
                   stock-jobbing and fertility in all low arts, to
                   obtain advantages of one kind and another, I never

                   with a strong detachment, broke ground at Cobble
                   hill, where the M'Lean Asylum now stands. The
                   object was to erect batteries for the purpose of
                   cannonading Boston. It was expected the British
                   troops would sally out of the city and attack them,
                   and that expectation caused Washington to issue the
                   order for _all_ the troops to be ready for action
                   at a moment's warning.]

                   [Footnote 185: That was the British storeship
                   _Nancy_, captured off Cape Anne, and carried into
                   that harbor, by Captain John Manly, commander of
                   the American armed schooner _Lee_, one of the six
                   vessels fitted out at Boston under the direction of
                   Washington, before Congress had yet taken any
                   measures to establish a navy. So valuable were the
                   stores of the _Nancy_, that Washington supposed
                   General Howe would immediately make efforts to
                   recover her, and he had an armed force sent to Cape
                   Anne to secure them. There were two thousand
                   muskets, one hundred thousand flints, thirty
                   thousand round shot for one, six, and twelve
                   pounders, over thirty thousand musket-shot, and a
                   thirteen-inch brass mortar that weighed
                   twenty-seven hundred pounds. The arrival of these
                   produced great joy in the camp. Colonel Moylan,
                   describing the scene, says: "Old PUT [General
                   Putnam] was mounted on the mortar, with a bottle of
                   rum in his hand, standing parson to christen, while

                   On the 29th of November, Washington commenced
                   planting a bomb-battery on Lechmere's point, with
                   the intention of bombarding the British works on

                   British outposts on Charlestown neck, and then to
                   attack the enemy on Bunker's hill. The Americans
                   started to cross from Cobble hill, on the ice. One
                   of the men slipped and fell when they were half way
                   across, and his gun went off. This alarmed the
                   British, and they were on their guard. It was
                   computed that, from the burning of Charlestown, on
                   the 17th of June, until Christmas day, the British
                   had fired more than two thousand shot and shells.

                   January, General Putnam sent Major Knowlton
                   (afterward killed at Harlem), with a small party,
                   to set those houses on fire. The affair was
                   injudiciously managed, and, before all could be
                   fired, the flames of one alarmed the British in the
                   fort. They discharged cannons and small-arms in all
                   directions, in their confusion and affright. At

                   exclaimed, "The Yankees are attacking Bunker's
                   hill!" The audience thought it was part of the
                   play, until General Howe said, "Officers, to your
                   alarm-posts!" Then women shrieked and fainted, and
                   the people rushed to the streets in great

SUPPLEMENT,
CONTAINING
OFFICIAL PAPERS ON THE SKIRMISHES AT LEXINGTON AND CONCORD,
AND A LIST OF REVOLUTIONARY ARTICLES IN THE POUGHKEEPSIE MUSEUM.




SUPPLEMENT.

OFFICIAL PAPERS CONCERNING THE SKIRMISHES AT LEXINGTON AND CONCORD.


In the preceding Journal of a Soldier, in 1775, his narrative
commences on the day of the skirmishes at Lexington and Concord, the
opening conflicts of the Revolution. Some official matters relating to
those events, which are inaccessible to the general reading-public,
will doubtless be acceptable, as they certainly are appropriate, in
this connection.

The skirmishes occurred on the 19th of April, 1775. On the 22d, the
Provincial Congress of Massachusetts assembled, and, deeming it
important to have the whole truth known, appointed a committee to take
depositions in relation to the transactions of the British troops in
their route to and from Concord. Another committee was appointed the
following day, consisting of Dr. Church, Elbridge Gerry, and Thomas
Cushing, to draw up a narrative of the massacre. The committee to
take depositions held their sessions at Concord and Lexington, on the
23d and 25th of April. Feeling it to be expedient to send an account
immediately to England, a committee, consisting of Dr. Warren, Mr.
Freeman, Mr. Gardiner, and Colonel Stone, was chosen to prepare a
letter to Dr. Franklin, the colonial agent in London. They reported a
letter, and also an "Address to the Inhabitants of Great Britain," on
the same day. Captain Richard Derby, of Salem, was employed to proceed
immediately with the despatches. He placed them in the hands of Doctor
Franklin on the 29th of May, and on the following day the address was
printed and circulated. It gave the first intelligence of the
skirmishes at Lexington and Concord, to the British public.

The following, copied from the Journals of the Continental Congress,
are the several papers referred to:--

  "_To the Hon. Benjamin Franklin, Esq., at London._
    "IN PROVINCIAL CONGRESS, WATERTOWN, _April 26, 1775_.

     "SIR: From the entire confidence we repose in your faithfulness
     and abilities, we consider it the happiness of this colony that
     the important trust of agency for it, in this day of unequalled
     distress, is devolved on your hands, and we doubt not your
     attachment to the cause and liberties of mankind will make every
     possible exertion in our behalf a pleasure to you; although our
     circumstances will compel us often to interrupt your repose, by
     matters that will surely give you pain. A singular instance
     hereof is the occasion of the present letter. The contents of
     this packet will be our apology for troubling you with it.

     "From these you will see how, and by whom, we are at last plunged
     into the horrors of a most unnatural war.

     "Our enemies, we are told, have despatched to Great Britain a
     fallacious account of the tragedy they have begun; to prevent the
     operation of which to the public injury, we have engaged the
     vessel that conveys this to you, as a packet in the service of
     this colony, and we request your assistance in supplying Captain
     Derby, who commands her, with such necessaries as he shall want,
     on the credit of your constituents in Massachusetts Bay.

     "But we most ardently wish that the several papers herewith
     enclosed may be immediately printed and dispersed through every
     town in England, and especially communicated to the lord-mayor,
     aldermen, and council, of the city of London, that they may take
     such order thereon as they may think proper. And we are confident
     your fidelity will make such improvement of them as shall
     convince all, who are not determined to be in everlasting
     blindness, that it is the united efforts of both Englands that
     can save either: but that whatever price our brethren in the one
     may be pleased to put on their constitutional liberties, we are
     authorized to assure you that the inhabitants of the other, with
     the greatest unanimity, are inflexibly resolved to sell theirs
     only at the price of their lives.

follows:--

                                   "LEXINGTON, _April 25, 1775_.

     "We, Solomon Brown, Jonathan Loring, and Elijah Sanderson, all of
     lawful age, and of Lexington, in the county of Middlesex, and
     colony of the Massachusetts Bay in New England, do testify and
     declare that, on the evening of the 18th of April, instant, being
     on the road between Concord and Lexington, and all of us mounted
     on horses, we were, about ten of the clock, suddenly surprised by
     nine persons, whom we took to be regular officers, who rode up to
     us, mounted and armed, each having a pistol in his hand, and,
     after putting pistols to our breasts, and seizing the bridles of
     our horses, they swore, if we stirred another step, we should be
     all dead men, upon which we surrendered ourselves. They detained
     us until two o'clock the next morning, in which time they
     searched and greatly abused us, having first inquired about the
     magazine at Concord, whether any guards were posted there, and
     whether the bridges were up, and said four or five regiments of
     regulars would be in possession of the stores soon. They then
     brought us back to Lexington, cut the horses' bridles and
     girths, turned them loose, and then left us.

     "I, Elijah Sanderson, above named, do further testify and
     declare, that I was on Lexington common, the morning of the 19th
     of April aforesaid, having been dismissed by the officers above
     mentioned, and saw a large body of regular troops advancing
     toward Lexington company, many of whom were then dispersing. I
     heard one of the regulars, whom I took to be an officer, say,
     "Damn them, we will have them;" and immediately the regulars
     shouted aloud, run and fired upon the Lexington company, which
     did not fire a gun before the regulars discharged on them. Eight
     of the Lexington company were killed while they were dispersing,
     and at a considerable distance from each other, and many wounded;
     and, although a spectator, I narrowly escaped with my life.

     that, being in the house of Daniel Harrington, of said Lexington,
     on the 19th instant, in the morning, about half an hour before
     sunrise, looked out at the window of said house, and saw (as I
     suppose) about four hundred regulars in one body, coming up the
     road, and marched toward the north part of the common, back of
     the meeting-house of said Lexington; and as soon as said regulars
     were against the east end of the meeting-house, the commanding
     officer said something, what I know not, but upon that the
     regulars ran till they came within about eight or nine rods of
     about a hundred of the militia of Lexington, who were collected
     on said common, at which time the militia of Lexington dispersed.
     Then the officers made a huzza, and the private soldiers
     succeeded them: directly after this, an officer rode before the
     regulars to the other side of the body, and hallooed after the
     militia of said Lexington, and said, "Lay down your arms, damn
     you, why don't you lay down your arms?"--and that there was not a
     gun fired till the militia of Lexington were dispersed. And
     further saith not.

     "Simon Winship, of Lexington, in the county of Middlesex, and
     province of Massachusetts Bay, New England, being of lawful age,
     testifieth and saith, that on the 19th April instant, about four
     o'clock in the morning, as he was passing the public road in said
     Lexington, peaceably and unarmed, about two miles and a half
     distant from the meeting-house in said Lexington, he was met by a
     body of the king's regular troops, and being stopped by some
     officers of said troops, was commanded to dismount. Upon asking
     why he must dismount, he was obliged by force to quit his horse,
     and ordered to march in the midst of the body; and, being
     examined whether he had been warning the minute-men, he answered,
     'No, but had been out, and was then returning to his father's.'
     Said Winship farther testifies that he marched with said troops,
     till he came within about half a quarter of a mile of said
     meeting-house, where an officer commanded the troops to halt, and
     then to prime and load: this being done, the said troops marched
     on till they came within a few rods of Captain Parker's company,
     who were partly collected on the place of parade, when said
     Winship observed an officer at the head of said troops,
     flourishing his sword, and with a loud voice giving the word,
     'Fire! fire!' which was instantly followed by a discharge of arms
     from said regular troops; and said Winship is positive, and in
     the most solemn manner declares, that there was no discharge of
     arms on either side, till the word 'Fire' was given by the said
     officer as above.

     Lexington, do testify and declare that, on the 19th instant, in
     the morning, about one of the clock, being informed that there
     were a number of regula-officers riding up and down the road,
     stopping and insulting people as they passed the road; and also
     was informed that a number of regular troops were on their march
     from Boston, in order to take the province stores at Concord,
     ordered our militia to meet on the common in said Lexington, to
     consult what to do, and concluded not to be discovered, nor
     meddle or make with said regular troops (if they should
     approach), unless they should insult or molest us; and, upon
     their sudden approach, I immediately ordered our militia to
     disperse, and not to fire. Immediately said troops made their
     appearance, and rushed furiously, fired upon, and killed eight of
     our party, without receiving any provocation therefor from us.

     the 19th instant, the company under the command of Captain John
     Parker, being drawn up (some time before sunrise) on the green or
     common, and I being in the front rank, there suddenly appeared a
     number of the king's troops, about a thousand, as I thought, at
     the distance of about sixty or seventy yards from us, huzzaing,
     and on a quick pace toward us, with three officers in their front
     on horseback, and on full gallop toward us, the foremost of which
     cried, 'Throw down your arms, ye villains, ye rebels!' upon which
     said company dispersing, the foremost of the three officers
     ordered their men, saying, 'Fire, by God! fire!' at which moment
     we received a very heavy and close fire from them; at which
     instant, being wounded, I fell, and several of our men were shot
     dead by me. Captain Parker's men, I believe, had not then fired
     a gun. And further the deponent saith not.

     on Lexington common, and mounted on horses, we saw a body of
     regular troops marching up to the Lexington company, which was
     then dispersing. Soon after, the regulars fired, first, a few
     guns, which we took to be pistols from some of the regulars who
     were mounted on horses, and then the said regulars fired a volley
     or two before any guns were fired by the Lexington company; our

     marching from Boston toward Concord, with intent (as it was
     supposed) to take the stores, belonging to the colony, in that
     town, we were alarmed, and having met at the place of our
     company's parade, were dismissed by our captain, John Parker, for
     the present, with orders to be ready to attend at the beat of the
     drum. We further testify and declare, that, about five o'clock in

     and that some of the inhabitants, as they were passing, had been
     insulted by the officers, and stopped by them; and being also
     informed that the regular troops were on their march from Boston,
     in order (as it was said) to take the colony stores then
     deposited at Concord, we met on the parade of our company in this
     town. After the company had collected, we were ordered by Captain
     Parker (who commanded us) to disperse for the present, and to be
     ready to attend the beat of the drum; and accordingly the company
     went into houses near the place of parade. We further testify and
     say, that, about five o'clock in the morning, we attended the
     beat of our drum, and were formed on the parade; we were faced
     toward the regulars then marching up to us, and some of our
     company were coming to the parade with their backs toward the
     troops, and others, on the parade, began to disperse, when the
     regulars fired on the company, before a gun was fired by any of
     our company on them. They killed eight of our company, and
     wounded several, and continued their fire until we had all made
     our escape.

     the provincials retreated over; the company I commanded was one.
     Three companies of the above detachment went forward about two
     miles. In the meantime, the provincial troops returned, to the
     number of about three or four hundred. We drew up on the Concord

     we engaged and gave the first fire. This was the first engagement

     and the said company on their approach began to disperse; that
     notwithstanding this, the regulars rushed on with great violence,
     and first began hostilities, by firing on said Lexington company,
     whereby they killed eight, and wounded several others; that the
     regulars continued their fire until those of said company, who
     were neither killed nor wounded, had made their escape; that
     Colonel Smith, with the detachment, then marched to Concord,
     where a number of provincials were again fired on by the troops,
     two of them killed and several wounded, before the provincials
     fired on them; and that these hostile measures of the troops
     produced an engagement that lasted through the day, in which many
     of the provincials and more of the regular troops were killed and
     wounded.

     "To give a particular account of the ravages of the troops, as
     they retreated from Concord to Charlestown, would be very
     difficult, if not impracticable. Let it suffice to say, that a
     great number of the houses on the road were plundered, and
     rendered unfit for use; several were burnt; women in childbed
     were driven, by the soldiery, naked into the streets; old men
     peaceably in their houses were shot dead; and such scenes
     exhibited as would disgrace the annals of the most uncivilized
     nations.

     "These, brethren, are marks of ministerial vengeance against this
     colony, for refusing, with her sister-colonies, a submission to
     slavery; but they have not yet detached us from our royal
     sovereign. We profess to be his loyal and dutiful subjects, and
     so hardly dealt with as we have been, are still ready, with our
     lives and fortunes, to defend his person, family, crown, and
     dignity. Nevertheless, to the persecution and tyranny of his
     cruel ministry we will not tamely submit: appealing to Heaven for
     the justice of our cause, we determine to die or be free.

     "We can not think that the honor, wisdom, and valor of Britons
     will suffer them to be long inactive spectators of measures in
     which they themselves are so deeply interested--measures pursued
     in opposition to the solemn protests of many noble lords, and
     expressed sense of conspicuous commoners, whose knowledge and
     virtue have long characterized them as some of the greatest men
     in the nation--measures executing contrary to the interest,
     petitions, and resolves of many large, respectable, and opulent
     counties, cities, and boroughs in Great Britain--measures highly
     incompatible with justice, but still pursued with a specious
     pretence of easing the nation of its burdens--measures which, if
     successful, must end in the ruin and slavery of Britain, as well
     as the persecuted American colonies.

     "We sincerely hope that the great Sovereign of the universe, who
     hath so often appeared for the English nation, will support you
     in every rational and manly exertion, with these colonies, for
     saving it from ruin; and that, in a constitutional connection
     with the mother-country, we shall soon be altogether a free and
     happy people.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
