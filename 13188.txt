Preface



The purpose of this book, as conceived by the author, is not to attempt to
create or to influence usage by pointing out which words should or should
not be used, nor to explain the meaning of terms, but simply to provide in
a form convenient for reference and study the words that can be used,
leaving it to those who consult its pages to determine for themselves,
with the aid of a dictionary if necessary, which words supply the
information they are looking for or express most accurately the thoughts
in their minds. The questions, therefore, that were constantly in the
author's mind while he was preparing the manuscript were not, _is_ this
word used? nor _should_ it be used? but is it a word that some one may
want to know as a matter of information or to use in giving expression to
some thought? When the word in question seemed to be one that would be of
service it was given a place in the collection to which it belongs.
Believing the book would be consulted by students and workers in special
fields, the author incorporated into it many words, including some
technical terms, that might, in the case of a work of more restricted
usefulness, have been omitted.

It happens frequently that the word which one thinks of first does not
express the exact shade of thought one desires to express and some other
word of similar meaning is necessary. For this reason there is, for those
who want to write and speak with precision and effectiveness, an important
use for collections of synonyms. Throughout this book synonyms means words
that are similar in meaning or which express the same general idea with
shades of difference. Those who use this work should bear in mind that all
words that are classified as synonyms cannot be used interchangeably; that
there are differences in meaning between them; and that, before using an
unfamiliar word, they should ascertain its meaning and usage in a
dictionary. Antonyms are words that are opposed to another word in
meaning. Such words are helpful when it is desired to express contrasted
or conflicting ideas or thoughts. In many instances, however, a list of
antonyms is unnecessary. For example, no antonyms of _good_ are found
after the synonyms of that word because one thinks of _bad_ instantly when
considering the opposite of _good_; and under _bad_ numerous synonyms,
which are also the antonyms of _good_, are found.

It is not an infrequent occurrence for a word to be required that is
neither a synonym nor an antonym of a familiar term but merely associated
with it in meaning and usage. Such a word cannot when unknown or
momentarily forgotten be easily found in a dictionary. In this volume
collections of such words are found after the general terms with which
they are associated. This feature of the book will be of service as a
memory-help when a word cannot be recalled and also, which is perhaps of
greater importance, by enabling writers and students to learn of words
objectively or through their associations.

By turning to the word that is thought of first or to the word with which
the term that is wanted is associated and reading the collections there
presented, any word that may be desired will be found.

The author spared no effort to make his work as complete as possible; and
he believes that it will be appreciated for its comprehensiveness,
modernity, and practical usefulness. He will be pleased to receive from
those who use his book any suggestions relative to changes, corrections,
or additions that might make the work more useful. He may be addressed in
care of the publishers.

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
