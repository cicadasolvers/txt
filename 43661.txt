Transcriber's note: A few obvious typographical errors have been corrected:
they are listed at the end of the text.

In this edition line numbers are displayed on every tenth line--in the
printed work they were synchronised to the pagination, with sometimes only
one number per page. Lines marked = were printed AND COUNTED as two lines.

Text enclosed by underscores is in italics (_italics_). Thorn and eth
characters (in cited passages) are expanded to th and dh respectively. A
carat character is used to denote superscription. A single character, or
group enclosed enclosed in curly brackets, following the carat is
superscripted (example: .xxx.^{ti}). In the main texts of The Vision and
The Creed, the numbers of the original pages are enclosed in curly brackets
to facilitate the use of the glossary.

          _Passus Decimus Quartus, etc._

  "Ihave but oon hool hater," quod Haukyn;                8900
  "I am the lasse to blame,
  Though it be soiled and selde clene:
  I slepe therinne o nyghtes.
  And also I have an houswif,
  Hewen and children,--
  _Uxorem duxi, et ideo non possum venire._--
  That wollen by-molen it many tyme,
  Maugree my chekes.
  It hath be laved in Lente
  And out of Lente bothe,                                 8910
  With the sope of siknesse,
  That seketh wonder depe,
  And with the losse of catel,
  Looth for to a-gulte
  God of any good man,
  By aught that I wiste;
  And was shryven of the preest
  That gaf me for my synnes
  To penaunce pacience
  And povere men to fede,                                 8920
  Al for coveitise of my cristendom
  In clennesse to kepen it.
  {274}
  And kouthe I nevere, by Crist!
  Kepen it clene an houre,
  That I ne soiled it with sighte
  Or som ydel speche,
  Or thorugh werk, or thorugh word,
  Or wille of myn herte,
  That I ne flobre it foule
  Fro morwe til even."                                    8930

    "And I shal kenne thee," quod Conscience,
  "Of contricion to make
  That shal clawe thi cote
  Of alle kynnes filthe.
  _Cordis contritio, etc._
  Do-wel shal wasshen and wryngen it
  Thorugh a wis confessour.
  _Oris confessio, etc._
  Do-bet shal beten it and bouken it
  As bright as any scarlet,                               8940
  And engreyven it with good wille
  And Goddes grace to amende the,
  And sithen sende thee to satisfaccion
  For to sowen it after.
  _Satisfactio Do-best._

    "Shal nevere cheeste by-molen it,
  Ne mothe after biten it,
  Ne fend ne fals man
  Defoulen it in thi lyve.
  Shal noon heraud ne harpour                             8950
  Have a fairer garnement
  Than Haukyn the actif man,
  And thow do by my techyng;
  Ne no mynstrall be moore worth
  Amonges povere and riche,
  Than Haukyns wif the wafrer,
  {275}
  With his _activa vita_."

    "And I shal purveie thee paast," quod Pacience,
  "Though no plough erye,
  And flour to fede folk with                             8960
  As best be for the soule,
  Though nevere greyn growed,
  Ne grape upon vyne.
  To alle that lyveth and loketh
  Liflode wolde I fynde,
  And that y-nogh shal noon faille
  Of thyng that hem nedeth,
  We sholde noght be to bisy
  Abouten oure liflode,"
  _Ne solliciti sitis, etc. Volucres coeli                8970
      Deus pascit, etc. Patientes
      vincunt._

    Thanne laughed Haukyn a litel,
  And lightly gan swerye,
  "Who so leveth yow, by oure Lord!
  I leve noght he be blessed."

    "No," quod Pacience paciently;
  And out of his poke hente
  Vitailles of grete vertues
  For alle manere beestes,                                8980
  And seide, "Lo here liflode y-nogh!
  If oure bileve be trewe.
  For lent nevere was lif,
  But liflode were shapen,
  Wher-of or wher-fore
  Or wher-by to libbe.

    "First the wilde worm
  Under weet erthe,
  Fissh to lyve in the flood,
  {276}
  And in the fir the criket,                              8990
  The corlew by kynde of the eyr
  Moost clennest flessh of briddes,
  And bestes by gras and by greyn
  And by grene rootes,
  In menynge that alle men
  Myghte the same
  Lyve thorugh leel bileve
  And love, as God witnesseth."
  _Quodcunque petieritis a patre in
      nomine meo, etc. Et alibi:                          9000
      Non in solo pane vivit homo,
      sed in omni verbo quod procedit
      de ore Dei._

    But I lokede what liflode it was
  That Pacience so preisede;
  And thanne was it a pece of the pater-noster,
  _Fiat voluntas tua._

    "Have, Haukyn," quod Pacience,
  "And et this whan the hungreth,
  Or whan thow clomsest for cold,                         9010
  Or clyngest for drye;
  Shul nevere gyves thee greve,
  Ne gret lordes wrathe,
  Prison ne peyne;
  For _patientes vincunt_.
  By so that thow be sobre
  Of sighte and of tonge,
  In etynge and in handlynge,
  And in alle thi fyve wittes,
  Darstow nevere care for corn,                           9020
  Ne lynnen cloth ne wollen,
  Ne for drynke, ne deeth drede,
  But deye as God liketh,
  {277}
  Or thorugh hunger or thorugh hete,
  At his wille be it.
  For if thow lyve after his loore,
  The shorter lif the bettre.
  _Si quis amat Christum,
      Mundum non diliget istum._

    "For thorugh his breeth beestes woxen                 9030
  And a-brood yeden.
  _Dixit et facta sunt, etc._
  _Ergo_ thorugh his breeth mowen
  Men and beestes lyven,
  As holy writ witnesseth,
  Whan men seye hir graces.
  _Aperis tu manum tuam, et imples
      omne animal benedictione._

    "It is founden that fourty wynter
  Folk lyvede withouten tulying;                          9040
  And out of the flynt sprong the flood
  That folk and beestes dronken;
  And in Elyes tyme
  Hevene was y-closed,
  That no reyn ne roon;
  Thus rede men in bokes                                  9046
  That many wyntres men lyveden,
  And no mete ne tulieden.

    "Sevene slepe, as seith the book,
  Sevene hundred wynter,
  And lyveden withouten liflode,
  And at the laste thei woken.
  And if men lyvede as mesure wolde,
  Sholde nevere moore be defaute
  Amonges cristene creatures,
  If Cristes wordes ben trewe.

  "Ac unkyndenesse _caristiam_ maketh                     9056
  {278}
  Amonges cristen peple;
  And over plentee maketh pryde
  Amonges poore and riche.
  Therfore mesure is muche worth,                         9060
  It may noght be to deere;
  For the meschief and the meschaunce
  Amonges men of Sodome,
  Weex thorugh plentee of payn,
  And of pure sleuthe.
  _Otiositas et abundantia panis peccatum
      turpissimum nutrivit._
  For thei mesured noght hemself
  Of that thei ete and dronke,
  Thei diden dedly synne                                  9070
  That the devel liked,
  So vengeaunce fil upon hem
  For hir vile synnes;
  Thei sonken into helle,
  The citees echone.

    "For-thi mesure we us wel,
  And make oure feith oure sheltrom;
  And thorugh feith cometh contricion,
  Conscience woot wel,
  Which dryveth awey dedly synne,                         9080
  And dooth it to be venial.
  And though a man myghte noght speke,
  Contricion myghte hym save,
  And brynge his soule to blisse;
  For so that feith bere witnesse,
  That whiles he lyvede, he bilevede
  In the loore of the holy chirche.
  _Ergo_ contricion, feith, and conscience
  Is kyndeliche Do-wel,
  {279}
  And surgiens for dedly synnes                           9090
  Whan shrift of mouthe failleth.
  Ac shrift of mouth moore worthi is,
  If man be y-liche contrit;
  For shrift of mouthe sleeth synne,
  Be it never so dedly.
  _Per confessionem_ to a preest
  _Peccata occiduntur._

    "Ther contricion dooth but dryveth it down
  Into a venial synne,
  As David seith in the Sauter,                           9100
  _Et quorum tecta sunt peccata_;
  Ac satisfaccion seketh out the roote,
  And bothe sleeth and voideth,
  An as it nevere hadde y-be
  To noghte bryngeth dedly synne,
  That it nevere eft is sene ne soor,
  But semeth a wounde y-heeled."

    "Where wonyeth Charite?" quod Haukyn,
  "I wiste nevere in my lyve
  Man that with hym spak,                                 9110
  As wide as I have passed."

    "Ther parfit truthe and poore herte is,
  And pacience of tonge,
  Ther is Charite the chief chaumbrere
  For God hymselve."

    "Wheither paciente poverte," quod Haukyn,
  "Be moore plesaunt to our Drighte
  Than richesse rightfulliche wonne,
  And resonably despended?"

    "Ye, _quis est ille_?" quod Pacience;                 9120
  "Quik _laudabimus eum_.
  {280}
  Though men rede of richesse
  Right to the worldes ende,
  I wiste nevere renk that riche was,
  That whan he rekene sholde,
  Whan he drogh to his deeth day,
  That he ne dredde hym soore,
  And that at the rekenyng in arrerage fel
  Rather than out of dette.
  Ther the poore dar plede,                               9130
  And preve by pure reson,
  To have allowance of his lord,
  By the lawe he it cleymeth;
  Joye, that nevere joye hadde,
  Of rightful jugge he asketh,
  And seith 'Lo! briddes and beestes
  That no blisse ne knoweth,
  And wilde wormes in wodes,
  Thorugh wyntres thow hem grevest;
  And makest hem wel neigh meke,                          9140
  And mylde for defaute;
  And after thow sendest hem somer,
  That is hir sovereyn joye,
  And blisse to alle that ben,
  Bothe wilde and tame.'

    "Thanne may beggeris as beestes
  After boote waiten,
  That al hir lif han lyved
  In langour and in defaute,
  But God sente hem som tyme                              9150
  Som manere joye
  Outher here or ellis where,
  Kynde wolde it nevere;
  For to wrotherhele was he wroght
  That nevere was joye shapen.
  {281}
  Aungeles that in helle now ben
  Hadden joye som tyme;
  And Dives in the deyntees lyvede,
  And in _douce vie_.
  Right so reson sheweth                                  9160
  That the men that were riche,
  And hir makes also,
  Lyvede hir lif in murthe.

    "Ac God is of wonder wille,
  By that kynde wit sheweth,
  To gyve many man his mede
  Er he it have deserved.
  Right so fareth God by some riche,
  Ruthe me it thynketh;
  For thei han hir hire heer,                             9170
  And hevene, as it were,
  And greet likynge to lyve
  Withouten labour of bodye:
  And whan he dyeth, ben disalowed,
  As David seith in the Sauter:
  _Dormierunt, et nihil invenerunt._
  And in another stede also:
  _Velut somnium surgentium, Domine,
      in civitate tua, et ad nihilum
      rediges, etc._                                      9180

    "Allas! that richesse shal reve
  And robbe mannes soule
  From the love of oure Lord,
  At his laste ende.

    "Hewen, that han hir hire afore,
  Arn evere moore nedy;
  And selden deyeth he out of dette,
  That dyneth er he deserve it,
  And til he have doon his devoir
  {282}
  And his dayes journee.                                  9190
  For whan a werkman hath wroght,
  Than many men se the sothe
  What he were worthi for his werk,
  And what he hath deserved;
  And noght to fonge bifore,
  For drede of disalowyng.

    "So I seye by yow riche,
  It semeth noght that ye shulle
  Have hevene in youre here dwellyng,
  And hevene also therafter;                              9200
  Right so as a servaunt taketh his salarie bifore,
  And siththe wolde clayme moore,
  As he that noon hadde,
  And hath hire at the laste.
  It may noght be, ye riche men,
  Or Mathew on God lyeth:
  _Vae! deliciis ad delicias difficile est
      transire._

    "Ac if ye riche have ruthe,
  And rewarde wel the poore,                              9210
  And lyven as lawe techeth,
  And doon leaute to hem alle,
  Crist of his curteisie
  Shal conforte yow at the laste,
  And rewarden alle double richesse
  That rewful hertes habbeth.
  And as an hyne that hadde
  His hire er he bigonne,
  And whan he hath doon his devoir wel
  Men dooth hym oother bountee,                           9220
  Gyveth hym a cote above his covenaunt,
  {283}
  Right so Crist gyveth hevene
  Bothe to riche and to noght riche
  That rewfulliche libbeth;
  And alle that doon hir devoir wel
  Han double hire for hir travaille,
  Here forgifnesse of hir synnes,
  And hevene blisse after.

    "Ac it is but selde y-seien,
  As by holy seintes bokes,                               9230
  That God rewarded double reste
  To any riche wye.
  For muche murthe is amonges riche,
  As in mete and clothyng;
  And muche murthe in May is
  Amonges wilde beestes,
  And so forth while somer lasteth
  Hir solace dureth.

    "Ac beggeris aboute Midsomer
  Bred-lees thei slepe.
  And yet is wynter for hem worse,
  For weet shoed thei gone,
  A-furst soore and a-fyngred,
  And foule y-rebuked,                                    9244
  And a-rated of riche men
  That ruthe is to here.
  Now, Lord, sende hem somer,
  And som maner joye,
  Hevene after hir hennes goyng,
  That here han swich defaute,
  For alle myghtestow have maad
  Noon mener than oother,
  And y-liche witty and wise,
  If thee wel hadde liked.
  But, Lord, have ruthe on thise riche men,               9254
  {284}
  That rewarde noght thi prisoners.
  Of the good that thow hem gyvest
  _Ingrati_ ben manye;
  Ac, God, of thi goodnesse
  Gyve hem grace to amende.
  For may no derthe be hem deere,                         9260
  Droghte ne weet hem greve,
  Ne neither hete ne hayll;
  Have thei hir heele,
  Of that thei wilne and wolde
  Wanteth hem noght here.

    "Ac poore peple thi prisoners,
  Lord, in the put of meschief,
  Conforte tho creatures,
  That muche care suffren
  Thorugh derthe, thorugh droghte,                        9270
  Alle hir dayes here,
  Wo in wynter tymes
  For wantynge of clothes,
  And in somer tyme selde
  Soupen to the fulle.
  Conforte thi carefulle,
  Crist, in thi richesse;
  For how thow confortest alle creatures,
  Clerkes bereth witnesse:
  _Convertimini ad me, et salvi eritis_.                  9280

    "Thus _in genere_ of gentries
  Jhesu Crist seide,
  To robberis and to reveris,
  To riche and to poore,
  Thou taughtest hem in the Trinite
  To taken bapteme,
  And to be clene through that cristnyng
  Of alle kynnes synne;

  To falle in synne after,                                9290

  As man wolde desire.
  And if the pope wolde plede ayein,
  And punysshe us in conscience,
  He sholde take the acquitaunce as quyk,
  And to the queed shewen it.
  _Pateat, etc. per passionem Domini._
  And putten of so the pouke,                             9300
  And preven us under borwe.
  Ac the parchemyn of this patente
  Of poverte be moste,
  And of pure pacience,
  And parfit bileve.

    "Of pompe and of pride
  The parchemym decourreth,
  And principalliche of al the peple,
  But thei be poore of herte;
  Ellis is al on ydel,                                    9310
  Al that evere writen

  And pilgrymages to Rome;
  But oure spences and spendynge
  Sprynge of a trewe wille,

  Lo! how men writeth
  In fenestres at the freres,
  If fals be the foundement.

    "For sevene synnes ther ben,
  That assaillen us evere;
  The fend folweth hem alle,
  And fondeth hem to helpe.
  Ac with richesse that ribaud
  He rathest men bigileth.
  For ther that richesse regneth,
  Reverence folweth;
  And that is plesaunt to pride,                          9330
  In poore and in riche.
  And the riche is reverenced
  By reson of his richesse,
  Ther the poore is put bihynde,
  And peraventure kan moore
  Of wit and of wisdom,
  That fer awey is bettre
  Than richesse or reautee,
  And rather y-herd in hevene.
  For the riche hath muche to rekene;                     9340
  And many tyme hym that walketh
  The heighe wey to hevene-ward,
  Richesse hym letteth,--
  _Ita inpossibile diviti, etc._--
  Ther the poore preesseth bifore the riche,
  With a pak at his rugge,--
  _Opera enim illorum sequuntur illos_.--
  Batauntliche, as beggeris doon,
  And boldeliche he craveth,
  For his poverte and his pacience,                       9350
  A perpetuel blisse.
  _Beati pauperes, quoniam ipsorum

    "And pride in richesse regneth
  Rather than in poverte;
  {287}
  Arst in the master than in the man
  Som mansion he haveth.
  Ac in poverte, ther pacience is,
  Pride hath no myghte,
  Ne none of the sevene synnes                            9360
  Sitten ne mowe ther longe,

  To asken hym any moore therof,                         10930
  And bad hym ful faire
  To discryve the fruyt
  That so faire hangeth.

    "Heer no bynethe," quod he tho,
  "If I nede hadde,
  Matrimoyne I may nyme,
  A moiste fruyt withalle;
  Thanne continence is neer the crop,
  As kaylewey bastard,
  Thanne bereth the crop kynde fruyt,                    10940

    I preide Piers tho to pulle a-doun
  An appul, and he wolde,
  And suffre me to assaien
  What savour it hadde.

    And Piers caste to the crop,                         10950
  {335}
  And thanne comsed it to crye,
  And waggede widwehode,
  And it wepte after;
  And whan it meved matrimoyne,
  It made a foul noise.
  And I hadde ruthe whan Piers rogged,
  It gradde so rufulliche;
  For evere as thei dropped a-doun,
  The devel was redy
  And gadrede hem alle togideres,                        10960
  Bothe grete and smale,
  Adam and Abraham,
  And Ysaye the prophete,
  Sampson and Samuel,
  And seint Johan the Baptist,
  Bar hem forth bodily,
  No body hym letted,
  And made of holy men his hoord
  _In limbo inferni_,
  There is derknesse and drede,                          10970
  And the devel maister.

    And Piers, for pure tene,
  Of that a pil he raughte;
  He hitte after hym,
  Hitte how it myghte,
  _Filius_ by the fader wille,
  And frenesse of _Spiritus sancti_,
  To go robbe that rageman,
  And reve the fruyt fro hym.

    And thanne spak _Spiritus sanctus_                   10980

  Til he weex a faunt thorugh hir flessh,
  And of fightyng kouthe,

  And Piers the Plowman
  Perceyved plener tyme,
  And lered hym lechecraft

  Ac as he made the maistrie,
  _Moestus coepit esse_,
  And wepte water with hise eighen,
  Ther seighen it manye.
  Some that the sighte seighen,
  Seiden that tyme

  And lord of heigh hevene.
  Jewes jangled ther ayein,                              11040
  And juggede lawes
  And seide he wroghte thorugh wichecraft,

    Thanne, "are ye cherles," quod ich,

  For silver or ellis."

    Judas jangled ther ayein;
  Ac Jhesus hym tolde,
  It was hymself soothly,
  And seide _tu dicis_.

    Thanne wente forth that wikked man,
  And with the Jewes mette,
  And tolde hem a tokne
  How to knowe with Jhesus,                              11100
  And which tokne to this day
  To muche is y-used,
  That is kissynge and fair countenaunce,
  And unkynde wille.
  And so was with Judas tho,
  That Jhesus bitrayed:
  "_Ave, raby_," quod that ribaud,
  And right to hym he yede,
  And kiste hym, to be caught therby,
  And kulled of the Jewes.                               11110

    Thanne Jhesus to Judas
  And to the Jewes seide,
  "Falsnesse I fynde
  In thi faire speche,
  And gile in thi glad chere,
  And galle is in thi laughyng;
  Thow shalt be myrour

  Sittynge on a mule,

  Comynge from a contree                                 11470
  That men called Jerico,
  To a justes in Jerusalem
  He chaced awey faste.
  Bothe the heraud and Hope
  And he mette at ones
  Where a man was wounded,
  And with theves taken;
  He myghte neither steppe ne stande,
  Ne stere foot ne handes,
  Ne helpe hymself soothly,                              11480
  For semy-vif he semed,
  And as naked as a nedle,
  And noon help aboute hym.

    Feith hadde first sighte of hym;
  Ac he fleigh aside,
  And nolde noght neghen hym
  By nyne londes lengthe.

    Hope cam hippynge after,
  That hadde so y-bosted
  How he with Moyses maundement                          11490

  Ac whan he hadde sighte of that segge

  Dredfully bi this day,
  As doke dooth fram the faucon.

    Ac so soone so the Samaritan
  Hadde sighte of this leode,
  He lighte a-down of lyard,
  And ladde hym in his hande,
  And to the wye he wente                                11500
  Hise woundes to biholde;
  And perceyved bi his pous
  He was in peril to dye,
  And but he hadde recoverer the rapelier,
  That rise sholde he nevere.
  With wyn and with oille
  Hise woundes he wasshed,
  Enbawmed hym and bond his heed,
  And in his lappe hym leide,
  And ladde hym so forth on lyard                        11510
  Te _lex Christi_, a graunge
  Wel sixe mile or sevene
  Biside the newe market;
  Herberwed hym at an hostrie,
  And to the hostiler called,
  And seide, "Have kepe this man
  Til I come fro the justes;
  And lo! here silver," he seide,
  "For salve to hise woundes."
  And he took hym two pens,                              11520
  To liflod, as it weere;
  And seide, "What he spendeth moore,
  I make thee good herafter;
  For I may noght lette," quod that leode;
  And lyard he bistrideth,
  And raped hym to Jerusalem-ward

    Feith folwede after faste,
  And fondede to mete hym;
  And _Spes_ spakliche hym spedde,                       11530
  Spede if he myghte
  To overtaken hym and talke to hym,
  Er thei to towne coome.

    And whan I seigh this, I sojourned noght,
  But shoop me to renne,
  And suwed that Samaritan
  That was so ful of pite,
  And graunted hym to ben his groom.
  "Graunt mercy!" he seide;
  "Ac thi frend and thi felawe," quod he,                11540
  "Thow fyndest me at nede."

    And I thanked hym tho,
  And siththe I hym tolde
  How that Feith fleigh awey,
  And _Spes_ his felawe bothe,
  For sighte of that sorweful man
  That robbed was with theves.

  Hise lawes and his large.
  And so dide Jhesus the Jewes,
  He justified and taughte hem
  The lawe of lif,
  That laste shal evere;
  And defended from foule yveles,                        13050

  Feveres and fluxes,
  And from fendes that in hem were,
  And false bileve.
  Tho was he Jhesus of Jewes called,
  Gentile prophete,
  And kyng of hir kyngdom,
  And croune bar of thornes.

    "And tho conquered he on cros,
  As conquerour noble.
  Mighte no deeth hym for-do,                            13060
  Ne a-doun brynge,
  That he naroos and regnede,
  And ravysshed helle:
  And tho was he conquerour called
  Of quyke and of dede.

    "And sith he yaf largely                             13070

  Places in Paradis,
  At hir partynge hennes;
  He may wel be called conquerour,
  And that is Crist to mene.

    "Ac the cause that he cometh thus
  With cros of his passion,
  Is to wissen us therwith
  That whan that we ben tempted,
  Therwith to fighte and defenden us                     13080

  And so bi his sorwe,

  And how he com to that name,
  Faithly for to speke,                                  13090
  His firste name was Jhesus;
  Tho he was born in Bethleem,
  As the book telleth,
  And cam to take mankynde,
  Kynges and aungeles
  Reverenced hym faire
  With richesses of erthe,
  Aungeles out of hevene
  Come knelynge and songe,
  _Gloria in excelsis Deo, etc._                         13100

    "Kynges that come after
  Knelede, and offrede

  Or any kynnes catel,
  But knowelichynge hym sovereyn

  And sithenes thei wente
  Into hir kyngene kith,
  By counseil of aungeles.                               13110
  And there was that word fulfilled
  The which thow of speke.
  _Omnia caelestia terrestria flectantur
      in hoc nomine Jhesu._

    "For alle the aungeles of hevene
  At his burthe knelede,
  And al the wit of the world
  Was in tho thre kynges,

  Reson and rightwisnesse
  And ruthe thei offrede;                                13120
  Wherfore and why
  Wise men that tyme,
  Maistres and lettred men,
  _Magi_ hem callede.

    "That o kyng cam with reson,
  Covered under sense.

    "The seconde kyng siththe

  For gold is likned to leautee
  That laste shal evere.

    "The thridde kyng tho kam
  Knelynge to Jhesu,
  And presented hym with pitee,
  Apperynge by mirre.
  For mirre is mercy to mene
  And mylde speche of tonge.

    "Thre y-liche honeste thynges
  Were offred thus at ones,                              13140
  Thorugh thre kynne kynges
  Knelynge to Jhesu,

    "Ac for alle thise preciouse presentz,
  Oure Lord kyng Jhesus
  Was neither kyng ne conquerour,
  Til he gan to wexe
  In the manere of a man,
  And that by muchel sleighte,
  As it bi-cometh a conquerour
  To konne manye sleightes,                              13150
  And manye wiles and wit,
  That wole ben a ledere.
  {402}
  And so dide Jhesu in hise dayes,
  Who so hadde tyme to telle it.

    "Som tyme he suffrede,
  And som tyme he hidde hym;
  And some tyme he faught faste,
  And fleigh outher while;

  As hym liste he wroghte.
  As kynde is of a conquerour,
  So comsede Jhesu,
  Til he hadde alle hem
  That he for bledde.

    "In his juventee this Jhesus
  At Jewene feeste
  Water into wyn turnede,
  As holy writ telleth.                                  13170
  And there bigan God
  Of his grace to do-wel.
  For wyn is likned to lawe
  And lif-holynesse,
  And lawe lakkede tho,
  For men lovede noght hir enemys.
  And Crist counseileth thus,
  And comaundeth bothe,
  To lered and to lewede
  To lovyen oure enemys.                                 13180
  So at the feeste first,
  As I bifore tolde,
  Bigan God of his grace
  And goodnesse to do-wel.
  And thanne was he called
  Noght holy Crist, but Jhesu,
  {403}
  A faunt fyn ful of wit,
  _Filius Mariae._
  For bifore his moder Marie
  Made he that wonder;                                   13190
  That she first and formest
  Ferme sholde bileve
  That he thorugh grace was gete,
  And of no gome ellis.
  He wroghte that by no wit,
  But thorugh word one;
  After the kynde that he cam of,
  There comsede he do-wel.

    "And whan he woxen was moore,
  In his moder absence,                                  13200
  He made lame to lepe,
  And yaf light to blynde,

  Mo than fyve thousand.

    "Thus he confortede carefulle

  For deve thorugh hise doynges to here

  And tho was he called in contre
  Of the comune peple,
  For the dedes that he dide,
  _Fili David, Jhesus._
  For David was doghtiest
  Of dedes in his tyme.                                  13220

    Thus Conscience of Crist
  And of the cros carpede,
  And counseiled me to knele therto.

  Alle kynne langages.
  I wondred what that was,
  And waggede Conscience,
  And was a-fered of the light,
  For in fires lightnesse
  _Spiritus paraclitus_
  Over-spradde hem alle.

    Quod Conscience, and knelede,

    Thanne song I that song,
  So dide manye hundred,

    And thanne bigan Grace                               13380

    Quod Piers, "Hareweth alle that konneth kynde wit,
  By conseil of thise doctours;                          13591

    And Grace gaf hym the cros,
  With the croune of thornes,
  That Crist upon Calvarie
  For mankynde on pyned,
  And of his baptisme and blood
  That he bledde on roode
  He made a manere morter,
  And mercy it highte.
  And therwith Grace bi-gan                              13610
  To make a good foundement,
  And watlede it and walled it
  With his peyne and his passion,
  And of al holy writ
  He made a roof after,
  And called that hous _Unitee_,
  Holy chirche on Englisshe.

    And whan this dede was doon,
  Grace devysede
  A cart highte cristendom                               13620
  To carie Piers sheves;
  And gaf hym caples to his carte,

    Now is Piers to the plow;
  And Pride it aspide,

  Manye a lovely lady,
  And lemmans of knyghtes,

    This Lecherie leide on
  With a janglynge chiere,
  And with pryvee speche
  And peyntede wordes;

  Of holy chirche the techeris.

    Thanne cam Coveitise,

  And cardinale vertues,
  And armed hym in avarice,                              14170
  And hungriliche lyvede.
  His wepne was al wiles
  To wynnen and to hiden;

  With many a bright noble,

  Of Westmynstre Halle.
  He jogged to a justice,
  And justed in his eere,
  And over-tilte al his truthe
  With "Tak this up amendement."

    And to the Arches in haste
  He yede anoon after,
  And tornede cyvyle into symonye,
  And siththe he took the official
  For a mantel of menever,                               14200
  And made lele matrymoyne
  Departen er deeth cam,
  And devors shapte.

    "Allas!" quod Conscience, and cryde tho,
  "Wolde Crist of his grace
  That coveitise were cristene!
  That is so kene a fightere,
  And boold and bidynge
  While his bagge lasteth."

  And armed hym an haste
  With harlotes wordes;
  And heeld holynesse a jape,
  And hendenesse a wastour;
  And leet leautee a cherl,
  And lyere a fre man;
  Conscience and his counseil
  He counted at a flye
  {434}
  Thus relyede Lif,                                      14220
  For a litel fortune;
  And priketh forth with Pride,
  Preiseth he no vertue,
  Ne careth noght how Kynde slow,
  And shal come at the laste,
  And kille alle erthely creatures,
  Save Conscience oone.
  Lyf lepte aside,
  And laughte hym a lemman;
  "Heele and I," quod he,                                14230
  "And heighnesse of herte,
  Shal do thee noght drede
  Neither deeth ne elde,
  And to forgyte sorwe,
  And gyve noght of synne."

    This likede Lif,
  And his lemman Fortune;
  And geten in hir glorie
  A gadelyng at the laste,
  Oon that muche wo wroghte,                             14240
  Sleuthe was his name.
  Sleuthe wax wonder yerne,
  And soone was of age,
  And wedded oon Wanhope,
  A wenche of the stuwes.
  Hir sire was a sysour
  That nevere swoor truthe,
  Oon Tomme Two-tonge,
  Atteynt at ech enqueste.

    This Sleuthe was war of werre,                       14250
  And a slynge made,
  And threw drede of dispair
  A dozeyne myle aboute.
  {435}

    For care Conscience tho
  Cryde upon Elde,
  And bad hym fonde to fighte,
  And a-fere Wanhope.

    And Elde hente good hope,
  And hastiliche he shifte hym,
  And wayved awey Wanhope,                               14260
  And with Lif he fighteth.
  And Lif fleigh for feere
  To phisik after helpe,
  And bi-soughte hym of socour,
  And of his salve he hadde.
  He gaf hym gold good woon,
  That gladede his herte;
  And thei gyven hym ageyn
  A glazene howve.

    Lyf leeved that lechecraft                           14270
  Lette sholde elde,
  And dryven awey deeth
  With dyas and drogges.

    And Elde auntred hym on lyf,
  And at the laste he hitte
  A phisicien with a furred hood,
  That he fel in a palsie,
  And there dyed that doctour
  Er thre dayes after.

    "Now I se," seide Lif,                               14280
  "That surgerie ne phisik
  May noght a myte availle
  To mede ayein Elde."
  And in hope of his heele
  Good herte he hente,
  And rood forth to a revel,
  A ryche place and a murye;
  {436}
  The compaignye of confort
  Men cleped it som tyme.

    And Elde anoon after me                              14290
  And over myn heed yede;
  And made me balled bifore,
  And bare on the crowne.
  So harde he yede over myn heed,
  It wole be sene evere.

    "Sire yvele y-taught, Elde!" quod I,
  "Unhende go with the!
  Sith whanne was the wey
  Over mennes heddes?
  Haddestow be hende," quod I,                           14300
  "Thow woldest have asked leeve."

    "Ye, leve lurdeyn!" quod he;
  And leyde on me with age,
  And hitte me under the ere,
  Unnethe myghte ich here.
  He buffetted me so aboute the mouth,
  That out my teeth he bette;
  And gyved me in goutes,
  I may noght goon at large.
  And of the wo that I was inne                          14310
  My wif hadde ruthe,
  And wisshed ful witterly
  That I were in hevene;
  For the lyme that she loved me fore,
  And leef was to feele,--
  On nyghtes, namely,
  Whan we naked weere,--
  I ne myghte in no manere
  Maken it at hir wille;
  So Elde and she, soothly,                              14320
  Hadden it for-beten.
  {437}

    And as I seet in this sorwe,
  I saugh how Kynde passede;
  And Deeth drogh neigh me.
  For drede gan I quake,
  And cryde to Kynde,
  "Out of care me brynge!
  Lo! Elde the hoore
  Hath me bi-seye.
  Awreke me! if youre wille be,                          14330
  For I wolde ben hennes."

    "If thow wolt be wroken,
  Wend into Unitee,
  And hold thee there evere,
  Til I sende for thee;
  And loke thow konne som craft,
  Er thow come thennes."

    "Counseille me, Kynde," quod I,
  "What craft is best to lerne."

    "Lerne to love," quod Kynde,                         14340
  "And leef of alle othere."

    "How shal I come to catel so,
  To clothe me and to feede?"

    "And thow love lelly," quod he,
  "Lakke shal thee nevere
  Mete ne worldly weede,
  While thi lif lasteth."

    And there by conseil of Kynde
  I comsed to rome
  Thorugh Contricion and Confession,                     14350
  Til I cam to Unitee.
  And there was Conscience conestable
  Cristene to save,
  And bisegede soothly
  With sevene grete geauntz
  {438}
  That with Antechrist helden
  Harde ayein Conscience.

    Sleuthe with his slynge
  An hard assaut he made.
  Proude preestes coome with hym                         14360
  Mo than a thousand,
  In paltokes and pyked shoes,
  And pisseris longe knyves,
  Coomen ayein Conscience,
  With Coveitise thei helden.

    "By Marie!" quod a mansed preest
  Of the Marche of Walys,
  "I counte na-moore Conscience,
  By so I cacche silver,
  Than I do to drynke                                    14370
  A draughte of good ale."
  And so seiden sixty
  Of the same contree;
  And shotten ayein with shot
  Many a sheef of othes,
  And brode hoked arwes,
  Goddes herte and hise nayles;
  And hadden almoost Unitee,
  And holynesse a-down.

    Conscience cryede, "Helpe, Clergie!                  14380
  Or ellis I falle,
  Thorugh inparfite preestes
  And prelates of holy chirche."
  Freres herden hym crye,
  And comen hym to helpe;
  Ac for thei kouthe noght wel hir craft,
  Conscience forsook hem.

    Nede neghede tho neer,
  And Conscience he tolde
  {439}
  That thei come for coveitise                           14390
  To have cure of soules;
  "And for thei are povere, peraventure,
  For patrymoyne thei faille,
  They wol flatere and fare wel
  With folk that ben riche.
  And sithen thei chosen chele
  And cheitiftee poverte,
  Lat hem chewe as thei chose,
  And charge hem with no cure.
  For lomere he lyeth,                                   14400
  That liflode moot begge,
  Than he that laboureth for liflode,
  And leneth it beggeris.
  And sithen freres forsoke
  The felicite of erthe,
  Lat hem be as beggeris,
  Or lyve by aungeles foode."

    Conscience of this counseil tho
  Comsede for to laughe,
  And curteisliche conforted hem,                        14410
  And called in alle freres,
  And seide, "Sires, soothly
  Welcome be ye alle
  To Unitee and holy chirche;
  Ac o thyng I yow preye,
  Holdeth yow in Unitee,

    "For thi," quod conscience, "by Crist!               14460

    Envye herde this,                                    14470
  And heet freres to go to scole

  And preve it by Seneca,

    And yet he lyeth, as I leve,
  That to the lewed so precheth;
  For God made to men a lawe,                            14480

    Thus he gooth and gadereth,
  And gloseth there he shryveth,                         14660
  Til Contricion hadde clene foryeten
  To crye and to wepe;
  And wake for hise wikked werkes,
  As he was wont to doone,
  For confort of his confessour
  Contricion he lafte,
  That is the soverayneste salve
  For alle kynne synnes.

    Sleuthe seigh that,
  And so dide Pryde,                                     14670
  And comen with a kene wille
  Conscience to assaille.

    Conscience cryed eft,
  And bad Clergie helpe hym,
  And also Contricion,
  For to kepe the yate.

    "He lyth and dremeth," seide Pees,
  "And so do manye othere,
  The frere with his phisyk
  This folk hath enchaunted,                             14680
  And plastred hem so esily,
  Thei drede no synne."

    "By Crist!" quod Conscience tho,
  "I wole bicome a pilgrym,
  And walken as wide
  As the world lasteth,
  To seken Piers the Plowman,
  That Pryde may destruye;
  And that freres hadde a fyndyng,
  That for nede flateren,                                14690
  And countrepledeth me, Conscience.
  {448}
  Now Kynde me avenge,
  And sende me hap and heele,
  Til I have Piers the Plowman."
  And siththe he gradde after Grace,
  Til I gan awake.                                       14696

  Cros and curteis Christ                                    1
  This begynnyng spede,
  For the faders frendshipe
  That fourmed heaven,
  And through the special spirit
  That sprong of hem tweyne,
  And al in one God-hed
  Endles dwelleth.
  A, and all myn a.b.c.
  After have I lerned,                                      10
  And patred in my pater-noster
  Iche poynt after other;
  And after al, myne Ave-marie
  Almost to the end;
  But al my care is to comen,
  For I can nought my Crede.
  Whan I shall shewen my shrift,
  Shent mote I worthen;
  The preeste wil me punyche,
  And penaunce enjoyne;                                     20
  The lengthe of a lenton
  Flesh moot I leve,
  After that Estur is y-come,
  And that is hard fare;
  {452}
  And Wedenesday iche wyke
  Withouten flesh-mete.
  And also Jesu hymselfe
  To the Jewes he saide,
  "He that leeveth nought on me,
  He leseth the blisse."                                    30
  Therfor lerne the byleve
  Levest me were,
  Gif any worldly wight
  Wil me [it] couthe;
  Other lewed or lered,
  That lyveth thereafter
  And fulliche folweth the feith,
  And feyneth non other;
  That no worldeliche wele
  Wilneth no tyme,                                          40
  But liveth in lovyng of God,
  And his lawe holdeth;
  And for no gettyng of good
  Never his God greveth,
  But folweth hym the full way,
  As he the folke taughte.
  But to many maner of men
  This matter is asked,
  Both to lered and to lewed,
  That seyn that they liveden                               50
  Hollich on the grete God,
  And holden al his hestes.
  But by a fraynyng for than
  Faileth ther manye.
  For first I frayned the freres,
  And they me fulle tolden,
  That al the fruyt of the fayth
  Was in her foure orders;
  {453}
  And the cofres of Christendom,
  And the keie bothen,                                      60
  And the lock of byleve,
  Lieth loken in her hondes,

    Then wennede I to wytten,
  And with a whight I mette,
  A Minoure in a morwe-tide;
  And to this man I saide,
  "Sire, for greate Godes love!
  The graith thou me tell,
  Of what myddel-erde man
  Myght I best lerne                                        70
  My Crede? For I can it nought,
  My kare is the more.
  And therfore, for Christes love!
  Thy counseyl I preie.
  A Carm me hath y-covenant,
  The nede me to teche;
  But for thou knowest Carmes wel,
  Thy counsail I aske."

    This Minour loked on me,
  And laughyng he sayde,                                    80
  "Leve christen man,
  I leve that thou [art] madde:
  Whough shulde thei techen the god,
  That con non hemselve?
  They ben but jugulers,
  And japers of kynde;
  Lorels and lechures,
  And lemans holden,
  Neyther in order ne out,
  But unneth lybbeth,                                       90
  And by-japeth the folk
  With gestes of Rome.
  {454}
  It is but a faynt folke,
  Y-founded upon japes.
  They maketh hem Maries men,
  And so thei men tellen;
  And leieth on oure Lady
  Many a long tale.
  And that wicked folk
  Wymmen betraieth,                                        100
  And begileth hem her good
  With glaverynge wordes,
  And therwith holden her hous
  In harlotes warkes.
  And, so save me God!
  I hold it greate synne
  To gyven hem any good,
  Swiche glotones to fynde,
  To mayntaynen swiche maner men
  That michel good destruieth.                             110
  Yet seyn they in her sutiltie
  To sottes in townes,
  Thei comen out of Carmeli
  Christ for to folwen,
  And feyneth hem with holynesse,
  That yvele hem bisemeth.
  Thei lyven more in lecherie,
  And lyeth in her tales,
  Than suen any good liif;
  But lurken in her selles,                                120
  And wynnen werdliche good,
  And wasten it in synne.
  And ghif thei couthen her Crede,
  Other on Christ leveden,
  Thei weren nought so hardy
  Swyche harlotri usen.
  {455}
  Sikerli I can nought fynden
  Who hem first founded;
  But the foles foundeden hemselfe
  Freres of the Pye,                                       130
  And maken hem mendynans,
  And marre the puple.
  But what glut of tho gomes
  May any good kachen,
  He wyl kepen it hemself,
  And cofrene it faste;
  And thoigh his felawes fayle good,
  For hym he may sterven.
  Her monei mai byquest,
  And testament maken,                                     140
  And none obedience bere,
  But don as hym luste.
  And ryght as Robartes men
  Raken aboute
  At feyres and at full ales,
  And fyllen the cuppe;
  And precheth al of pardon,
  To plesen the puple.
  Her pacience is al pased,
  And put out to ferme;                                    150
  And pride is in her povertie,
  That litel is to preisen.
  And at the lullyng of oure lady
  The wymmen to lyken,
  And miracles of mydwyves,
  And maken wymmen to wenen
  That the lace of oure Lady smok
  Lighteth hem of children.
  Thei ne prechen nought of Powel,
  Ne penaunce for synne;                                   160
  {456}
  But al of merci and mensk,
  That Marie may helpen.
  With sterne staves and stronge
  Thei over lond straketh,
  Thider as here lemmans liggeth,
  And lurketh in townes,
  Grey grete-heded quenes
  With gold by the eighen,
  And seyne that her sustern thei ben,
  That sojurneth aboute.                                   170
  And thus abouten the gon,
  And Godes folke betrayeth.
  It is the puple that Powel
  Preched of in his tyme;
  He seyde of swich folke
  That so aboute wente,
  Wepyng, I warne you
  Of walkers aboute,
  It beth enemyes of the cros
  That Christ upon tholede.                                180
  Swiche slomrers in slepe,
  Slaughte in her ende,
  And glotonye is her God,
  With gloppynge of drynk,
  And gladnesse in glees,
  And grete joye y-maked.
  In the shendyng of swiche
  Shal mychel folk lawghe;
  Therfore, frend, for thy feith
  Fond to don beter;                                       190
  Leve nought on tho losels,
  Put let hem forth pasen,
  For thei ben fals in her faith,
  And feele mo other."
  {457}

    "Alas! frere," quath I tho,
  "My purpos is y-failed;
  Now is my comfort a-cast.
  Canstou no bote,
  Wher I myght meten with a man
  That myghte me wyssen                                    200
  For to conne my Crede,
  Christ for to folwen?"

    "Certeyn, felawe," quath the frere,
  "Withouten any fayle,
  Of al men upon mold,

  With penance on erthe,
  And suen hem in sanctite,
  And sufferen wel harde.                                  210
  We haunten no tavernes,

  For we buldeth a burwgh,
  A brod and a large,

  And pulched ful clene,                                   240
  With gay glitering glas
  Glowyng as the sunne.
  And mightestou amenden us
  With moneye of thyn owen,

  And present the to the Trinite,
  And praye for thy synnes.
  Thy name shal noblich ben wryten

  Y-rad there for evere.
  And, brother, be thou nought a-ferd;
  Bythenk in thyne herte,
  Though thou conne nought thy Crede,
  Care thou no-more!                                       260
  I shal asoilen the, syr,
  And setten it on my soule;
  {459}
  And thou may maken this good,
  Thenk thou non other."

    "Sir," I sayde, "in certaine
  I shal gon and asaye."
  And he set on me his hond,
  And asoiled me clene,
  And there I parted him fro
  Wythouten and peyne;                                     270
  In covenaunt that I come agayne,
  Christ he me be-taught.

    Then saide I to myself,
  "Here semeth litel treuthe!
  First to blame his brother,
  And bakbyten hym foule,
  There as curteis Christ
  Clerliche saide,
  Whow myght thou in thy brothers eighe

  See fyrst on thyself,
  And sithen on another,
  And clense clene thy syght,
  And kepe wel thyne eighe,
  And for another mannes eighe

  And also I see coveitise
  Catel to fongen,                                         290
  That Christ hath clerliche forboden,
  And clenliche destrueden;
  And sayde to his sueres
  For sothe on this wyse,
  'Nought thy neighbors good
  Coveyte in no tyme.'
  {460}
  But charite and chastite
  Ben chased out clene.
  But Christ seide by her fruit
  Men shal hem ful knowen."                                300
  Thanne saide I, "certeine, syr,
  Thou demest ful trewe."

    Than thought I to frayne the first
  Of this foure ordres;
  And presed to the Prechoures,
  To proven hir wille.
  Ich highed to her house,
  To herken of more;
  And when I came to that court,
  I gaped aboute,                                          310
  Swich a bild bold
  Y-buld upon erthe heighte
  Say I nought in certeyn
  Syththe a long tyme.
  I semed opon that hous,
  And yerne theron loked,
  Whow the pileres weren y-paint,
  And pulched ful clene,
  And queyntly y-corven
  With curious knottes;                                    320
  With wyndowes wel y-wrought,
  Wyde up a-lofte,
  And thanne I entred in,
  And even forth wente;
  And al was walled that wone,
  Though it wiid were,
  With posternes in privite
  To pasen when hem liste;
  Orcheyardes and erberes
  Evesed wel clene,                                        330
  {461}
  And a curious cros
  Craftly entayled,
  With tabernacles y-tight
  To toten al abouten.
  The pris of a plough-lond
  Of penies so rounde
  To aparaile that pyler
  Were pure litel.
  Than I munte me forth
  The mynstre to knowen,                                   340
  And awaytede a woon

  And bellyche y-corven,
  With crochetes on corneres,
  With knottes of gold,
  Wyde wyndowes y-wrought,
  Y-wryten ful thikke,
  Shynen with shapen sheldes,
  To shewen aboute,                                        350
  With merkes of merchauntes
  Y-medeled betwene,

  Ther is non heraud that hath

  Right as a rageman

  Tombes upon tabernacles
  Tylde opon lofte,                                        360
  Housed in hornes,

  Of armede alabaustre

  Y-sacred opon erthe;                                     370
  And lovely ladies y-wrought
  Leyen by her sydes
  In manye gay garnemens,
  That weren gold beten.
  Though the tax of ten yere
  Were trewely y-gadered,
  Nolde it nought maken that hous
  Half, as I trowe.
  Than cam I to that cloystre,
  And gaped abouten,                                       380
  Whough it was pilered and peynt,
  And portreyed wel clene,
  Al y-hyled with leed
  Lowe to the stones,
  And y-paved with poynttyl
  Ich point after other;
  With cundites of clene tyn
  Closed al aboute,
  With lavoures of latun
  Loveliche y-greithed.                                    390
  I trowe the gaynage of the ground
  In a gret shyre
  Nold aparaile that place
  Oo poynt tyl other ende.
  Thanne was that chapitre house
  Wrought as a greet chirche,
  Corven and covered;
  And queyntelyche entayled,
  {463}
  With semliche selure
  Y-seet on lofte,                                         400
  As a parlement-hous
  Y-peynted aboute.
  Thanne ferd I into fraytoure,
  And fond there another,
  An halle for an hygh kynge
  An houshold to holden,
  With brode bordes abouten
  Y-benched wel clene,
  With wyndowes of glaas
  Wrought as a chirche                                     410
  Than walkede I ferrer,
  And went al abouten,
  And seigh halles full heygh,
  And houses ful noble,
  Chambres with chymeneys,
  And chapeles gaye,
  And kychenes for an high kynge
  In casteles to holden;
  And her dortoure y-dight
  With dores ful stronge;                                  420
  Fermerye and fraitur,
  With fele mo houses,
  And al strong ston wal
  Sterne upon heithe,
  With gaye garites and grete,
  And iche hole y-glased,
  And other houses y-nowe
  To herberwe the queene.
  And yet thise bilderes wiln beggen
  A bagge ful of whete                                     430
  Of a pure pore man,
  That may onethe paye
  {464}
  Half his rent in a yere,
  And half ben byhynde.

    Than turned I ayen,
  Whan I hadde all y-toted,
  And fond in a freitoure
  A frere on a benche,
  A greet chorl and a grym,
  Growen as a tonne,                                       440
  With a face so fat
  As a ful bleddere
  Blowen bretful of breth,
  And as a bagge honged
  On bothen his chekes, and his chyn
  With a chol lollede
  So greet as a gos ey,
  Growen al of grece;
  That al wagged his fleish
  As a quick myre.                                         450
  His cope, that bi-clypped hym,
  Wel clene was it folden,
  Of double worstede y-dyght
  Doun to the hele.
  His kyrtel of clene whiit,
  Clenlyche y-sewed,
  Hit was good y-now of ground
  Greyn for to beren.
  I haylsede that hirdman,
  And hendlich I sayde,                                    460
  "Gode sire, for Godes love!
  Canstou me graith tellen
  To any worthely wiight
  That wissen me couthe,
  Whow I shulde conne my Crede,
  Christ for to folwe,
  {465}
  That levede lelliche hymselfe
  And lyvede therafter,
  That feynede no falshede,
  But fully Chrise suwede?                                 470
  For sich a certeyn man
  Syker wold I trosten,
  That he wolde telle me the trewthe,
  And turne to non other.
  And an Austyn this ender day
  Egged me faste,
  That he wolde techen me wel,
  He plyght me his treuthe,
  And seyde me "certeyn,
  Syghthen Christ deyed                                    480
  Oure ordre was euelles
  And erst y-founde."

    "First, felawe," quath he,
  "Fy on his pilche!
  He is but abortiif,
  Eked with cloutes,

  And purchaseth hem pryvyleges
  With penyes so rounde.                                   490
  It is a pur pardoners craft,
  Prove and asay;
  For have they thy money,
  A moneth therafter
  Certes, theigh thou come agen,
  He wil the nought knowen.
  But, felawe, oure foundement
  Was first of the othere,
  And we ben founded fulliche
  Withouten fayntise,                                      500
  {466}
  And we ben clerkes y-cnowen,
  Cunnyng in schole,
  Proved in processyon
  By processe of lawe.
  Of oure order ther beth
  Bichopes wel manye,
  Seyntes on sundri stedes
  That suffreden harde;
  And we ben proved the priis
  Of popes at Rome,                                        510
  And of grettest degre,
  As godspelles telleth."

    "A! syre," quath I thanne,
  "Thou seyst a grete wonder;
  Sithen Christ sayd hymselfe
  To alle his diciples,
  'Which of you that is most,
  Most shal he werche;
  And who is goere byforne,
  First shal he serven.'                                   520
  And seyde he saugh Satan
  Sytten ful heyghe,
  And ful low ben y-leid.
  In lyknesse he tolde,
  That in povernesse of spyrit
  Is spedfullest hele;
  And hertes of heyne
  Harmeth the soule.
  And therefore, frere, farewel;
  Here fynd I but pride.                                   530
  I preise nought thy prechyns,
  But as a pur myte."

    And angerich I wandrede
  The Austyns to prove,
  {467}
  And mette with a maistre of tho men,
  And meklich I seyde,
  "Maistre, for the moder love
  That Marie men calleth!
  Knowest thou ought there thou comest
  A creature on erthe                                      540
  That coude me my Crede teche,
  And trewelich enfourme,
  Withouten flateryng fare,
  And nothing feyne,
  That folweth fulliche the feith,
  And non other fables,
  Withouten gabinge of glose,
  As the godspelles telleth?
  A Minoure hath me holly behyght
  To helen my soule,                                       550
  For he seith that her secte
  Is sykerest on erthe,
  And ben kepers of the keye
  That Chrystendom helpeth,
  And puriche in poverte
  The apostles they suweth."
  "Allaas!" quath the frere,
  "Almost I madde in mynde,
  To sen hough this Minoures
  Many men bygyleth.                                       560
  Sothly somme of tho gomes
  Hath more good hymselve
  Than ten knyghtes that I knowe,
  Of catel in cofres.
  In fraytoure they faren best
  Of al the foure ordres,
  And usun ypocricie
  In al that thei werchen,
  {468}
  And prechen al of perfitnesse;
  But loke now, I the prey,                                570
  Nought but profre hem in privite

  And yet under that cope
  A cote hathe he furred
  With foyns, or with fichewes,
  Other fyn bevere,
  And that is cutted to the kne,
  And queyntly y-botend,                                   590
  Lest any spiritual man
  Aspie that gyle.
  Fraunceys bad his brethern
  Bar-fot to wenden;
  Now han they buclede shone,
  For blenyng of her heles,
  And hosen in harde weder
  Y-hamled by the ancle,
  And spicerie sprad in her purs
  To parten where hem luste.                               600
  Lordes loveth hem wel,
  For they so lowe crouchen;

  But knowen men her cautel
  And her queynte wordes,
  Thei wolde worshypen hem
  Nought but a litle,
  The ymage of ypocricie
  Ymped upon fendes.
  But, sone, gif thou wilt ben seker,
  Seche thou no ferther,                                   610
  We freres beth the firste,
  And founded upon treuthe;
  Paule _primus heremita_
  Put us hymselve
  Away into wildernesse,
  The world to despisen,
  And there we lengeden ful long,
  And leveden ful harde;
  For to alle this freren folke
  Weren founden in tounes,                                 620
  And taughten untrewely,
  And that we wel aspiede.
  And for chef charyte,
  We chargeden us selven
  In amendyng of this men,
  We maden oure celles
  To ben in cytes y-set,
  To styghtle the puple,
  Prechyng and prayeng
  As profetes shoulden.                                    630
  And so we holden us the hetheved
  Of al holy chirche.
  We han power of the Pope
  Purliche assoylen
  Al that helpen oure hous
  In helpe of her soules;
  {470}
  To dispensen hem with
  In dedes of synne,
  Al that amendeth oure hous
  In money other elles,                                    640
  With corne other catel,
  Or clothes to beddes,
  Other bedys or broche,
  Or breed for our fode.
  And gif thou hast any good,
  And wilt thyself helpen,
  Help us hertelich therwith,
  And here I undertake
  Thou shalt ben brother of oure hous,
  And a book habben                                        650
  At the nexte chapitre
  Clerliche enseled.
  And than oure provincial
  Hath power to assoylen
  Alle sustren and bretheren
  That beth of oure ordre.
  And though thou conne nought the Crede,
  Knele down here,
  My soule I sette for thyn,
  To asoile the clene,                                     660
  In covenaunt that thou come ageyne,
  And katel us brynge."
  And thanne loutede I adoun,
  Add he me leve grauntede;
  And so I parted hym fro,
  And the frere lefte.

    Than seide I to myself,
  "Here is no bote;
  Here pride is the pater-noster
  In preying of synne;                                     670
  {471}
  Her Crede is coveytise:--
  Now can I no ferthere.
  Yet wil I fonden forth,
  And fraynen the Carmes."
  Than toted I into a taverne,
  And there I aspyede
  Two frere Carmes
  With a ful coppe.
  There I auntrede me in,
  And aisliche I seyde,                                    680
  "Leve sire, for the Lordes love
  That thou on levest!
  Lere me to som man
  My Crede for to lerne,
  That lyveth in lel liif,
  And loveth no synne,
  And gloseth nought the godspel,
  But halt Godes hetes,
  And neyther money ne mede
  Ne may hym nought letten,                                690
  But werchen after Godes word,
  Withouten any faile.
  A Prechoure y-professed
  Hath plight me his trewthe
  To techen me trewely;
  But wouldest thou me tellen,
  For they ben certeyne men,
  And syker on to trosten,
  I would quiten the thy mede
  As my myght were."                                       700

    "A trefle," quath he, "trewely!
  His treweth is ful litel;
  He dynede nought with Dominic,
  Sithe Christ deide.
  {472}
  For with the prynces of pryde
  The Prechours dwellen;
  They ben so digne as the devel
  That droppeth fro heven,
  With hartes of heynesse,
  Whough halwen the cherches,                              710
  And deleth in devynyte
  As dogges doth bones.
  Thei medeleth with mesages

  Thei wilneth worchipes:--
  But waite on her dedes.                                  720
  Harkne at Herdforthe
  How that they werchen,
  And loke when that they lyven
  And leeve as thou fyndest.
  They ben counseylours of kynges,
  Christ wot the sothe,
  Whou thei curreth kynges
  And her bak claweth.
  God leve hem laden wel
  In lyvynge of hevene,                                    730
  And glose hem nought for her good
  To greven her soules.
  I pray the, where ben they pryve
  With any pore whightes
  That may nought amenden her hous,
  Ne amenden hemselven?
  They prechen in proud herte,
  And preyseth her ordre,
  {473}
  And werdlich worchype
  Wilneth in erthe.                                        740
  Leeve it wel, lef man,
  And men right lokede,
  There is more pryve pryde
  In Prechoures hertes,
  Than there lefte in Lucifere,
  Or he were lowe fallen.
  They bene dygne as dich-watere,
  That dogges in bayteth.
  Lok a ribaut of hem
  That can nought wel reden                                750
  His Rewel ne his Respondes,
  But be pure rote;
  Als as he were a connyng clerk,
  He casteth the lawes
  Nought lowly, but lordly,
  And lesynges lyeth.
  For right as Minoures
  Most hypocrice useth,
  Ryght so ben Prechoures proude
  Purlyche in herte.                                       760

    "But, chrysten creatoure,
  We Carmes firste comen,
  Even in Elyes tyme,
  First of hem alle;
  And lyven by oure Lady,
  And lelly her serven,

  Nowt proude as Prechoures beth,
  But preyen ful stylle.                                   770
  We couuen on no quentyse,

  With money other elles,
  With som catel, other corn,
  Or cuppes of sylvere."                                   790

    "Trewely, frere," quath I tho,
  "To tellen the the sothe,
  There is no peny in my pakke
  To payen for my mete.
  I have no good, ne no golde,
  But go thus abouten,
  And travaile ful trewely
  To wynnen with my fode.
  But woldest thou for Godes love
  Lerne me my Crede,                                       800
  I shulde don for the wil,
  Whan I wele hadde."

    "Trewely," quath the frere,
  "A fole I the holde:--
  Thou woldest nought wetten thy fote,
  And woldest fich kachen.

  Oure pardon and oure preieres
  So beth they nought parten,
  Oure power lasteth nought so feer,
  But we som peny fongen.                                  810

    "Fare wel," quath the frere,
  "For I mot hethen fonden,
  And hyen to an house-wiif
  That hath us byquethen
  Ten pound in hir testament.
  To tellen the sothe,
  Ho draweth to the deth-ward;
  But yet I am in drede
  Leste ho turne hire testament,
  And therfore I hyghe                                     820
  To haven hire to oure hous,
  And henten, gif I mighte,

  To helpen to clothe."
  "Godys forbode!" quath his felawe,
  "But ho forth passe
  Whil ho is in purpos
  With us to departen!
  God let hir no lengere lyven!
  For letteres ben manye."                                 830

    Thanne turnede I me forth,
  And talked to myselfe
  Of the falshede of this folke,
  Whow feythles thei weren.
  And as I wente by the way
  Wepynge for sorowe,
  I seigh a sely man me by,
  Opon the plough hongen.
  His cote was of a cloute
  That cary was y-called;                                  840
  {476}
  His hod was ful of holes,
  And his heare oute;
  With his knoppede shon
  Clouted ful thykke;
  His ton toteden out,
  As he the lond tredede;
  His hosen over-hongen his hok-shynes
  On everich a syde,
  Al beslomered in fen,
  As he the plow folwede.                                  850
  Tweye myteynes as meter
  Maad al of cloutes,
  The fyngres weren for-werd,
  And ful of fen honged.
  This whit waselede in the feen
  Almost to the ancle;
  Foure rotheren hym byforne,
  That feble were worthi;
  Men myghte reknen ich a ryb,
  So rentful they weren.                                   860
  His wiif walked hym with,
  With a long gode,
  In a cuttede cote,
  Cutted ful heyghe,
  Wrapped in a wynwe shete
  To weren hire fro wederes,
  Bar-fot on the bare iis,
  That the blod folwede.
  And at the londes ende lath
  A little crom-bolle,                                     870
  And theron lay a lytel chylde
  Lapped in cloutes,
  And tweyne of tweie yeres olde
  Opon another syde.
  {477}
  And al they songen o songe,
  That sorwe was to heren;
  They crieden alle o cry,
  A kareful note.
  The sely man sighed sore,
  And seyde, "Children, beth stille!"                      880
  This man lokede opon me,
  And leet the plough stonden;
  And seyde, "Sely man,
  Whi syghest thou so harde?
  Gif the lakke liiflode,
  Lene the ich wille
  Swich good as God hath sent;
  Go we, leeve brother."

    I sayde thanne, "Nay, syre,
  My sorowe is wel more.                                   890
  For I can nought my Crede,
  I care wel harde;
  For I can fynden no man
  That fulli byleveth,
  To techen me the heyghe weie,
  And therfore I wepe.
  For I have fonded the freres
  Of the foure ordres;
  For there I wende have wist,
  But now my wit lakketh;                                  900
  And al myn hope was on hem,
  And myn herte also,
  But thei ben fulli faithles,
  And the fend sueth."

    "A! brother," quath he tho,
  "Be ware of tho foles;
  For Christ seyde hymself,
  'Of swiche I you warne,'
  {478}
  And false profetes in the feith
  He fulliche hem calde,                                   910
  _In vestimentis ovium_,
  But only withinne
  They ben wilde werwolves
  That wiln the folke robben.
  The fen[d] founded hem first,
  The feyth to distrie;
  And by his craft thei comen in,
  To combren the chirche,
  By the covetise of his craft
  The curates to helpen.                                   920
  But nowe they haven an hold,
  They harmen ful manye;
  They don nought after Dominik,
  But dreccheth the puple.
  He folwen nought Fraunceis,
  But falsliche lybben;
  And Austynes rewle
  They rekeneth but a fable;
  And purchaseth hem privilege
  Of popes at Rome.                                        930
  They coveten confessiones,
  To kachen some hyre;
  And sepulturus also,
  Somme wayten to lacchen;
  But other cures of Christen
  They coveten nought to have,
  But there as wynnynge liith,
  He loketh non other."

    "Whough shal I nemne thy name,
  That neyghbores the calleth?"                            940
  "Peres," quath he, "the pore man,
  The Ploughman I hatte."
  {479}

    "A! Peres!" quath I tho,
  "I pray the thou me telle
  More of thise tryflers,
  Hou trechurly they libbeth;
  For ichon of hem hath tolde me
  A tale of that other,
  Of her wikked liif,
  In werld that he libbeth.                                950
  I trowe that some wicked wight
  Wroughte this ordres.
  Trow ye that gleym of that gest
  That Golias is y-cald,

  To combren men with her crafte,

    "Dere brother," quath Peres,
  "The devel is ful queynte,                               960
  To encombren holy chirche

  Opon fele wise,
  And fer he casteth to-forn
  The folk to dystroye.

    "Of the kynrede of Caym
  He cast the freres,
  And founded hem on Sarysenes,
  Feyned for God.                                          970
  But they with her falshe faith
  Mychel folk shendeth.
  Christ calde hem hymself
  Kynd ipocrites;
  How often he cursed hem,
  Wel can I tellen.
  {480}
  He seide ons hymself
  To that sory puple:
  'Who worthe you, wyghtes,
  Wel lerned of the lawe!'                                 980
  Eft he seyde to hem selfe,
  'Wo mote you worthen
  That the toumbes of profetes
  Bildeth up heighe!
  Your faderes for-deden hem,
  And to the deth hem broughte.'
  Here I touche this two,
  Twynnen hem I thenke.

  But maistres y-called,
  And wilneth worship of the werld,
  And sytten with heye,
  And leveth lovyng of God
  And lownesse byhynde,
  And in beldyng of toumbes
  Thei traveileth grete,
  To chargen her chirche flore,
  And chaungen it ofte.                                   1000
  And the fader of the freres
  Defouled her soules,
  That was the dyggyng devel,
  That dreccheth men ofte.
  The devel by his dotage
  Dissaveth the chirche,
  And put in the Prechours,
  Y-paynted withouten,
  And by his queyntise they comen in
  The curates to helpen;                                  1010
  {481}
  But that harmed hem harde,
  And halp hem ful littel.
  But Austynes ordinaunce
  Was on a good treuthe;
  And also Dominikes dedes
  Weren dernelich y-used;
  And Fraunceis founded his folke
  Fulliche on treuthe,
  Pure parfit prestes
  In penaunce to libben,                                  1020
  In love and in lownesse
  And lettynge of pryde,
  Grounded on the Godspel,
  As God baad hymselve.
  But now the glose is so greet
  In gladdyng tales,
  That turneth up two-fold
  Un-teyned upon treuthe,
  That they ben cursed of Christ,
  I can hem wel prove                                     1030
  Withouten his blissyng,
  Bare beth thei in her werkes.
  For Christ seyde hymselfe

  God leve it be a good help
  For hele of the soules!
  And also this myster men
  Ben maysters i-called,
  That the gentill Jesus
  Generalliche blamed,
  {485}
  And that poynt to his apostles
  Purly defended.
  But freres haven forgeten this,
  And the fend suweth,                                    1150

NOTES.

Line 1. Bale, quoting the first two lines, translates them _In aestivo
tempore, cum sol caleret_. The printers of the early editions altered
_softe_ to _set_.

4, 5. _shroudes ... sheep_. The other text of this poem reads _Yshop into
shrobbis | as y shepherde were_. See the Introduction.

28. The text represented in Whitaker's edition here differs much from the
other. Our dreamer is there introduced very unadvisedly telling us of this
tower, 'truthe was therynne,' a piece of information which he only learns
afterwards from dame 'Holy Churche:'

  Ich was aferd of hure face,
  Thauh hue faire were,
  And saide, mercy, madame,
  Wat may this be to mene,
  _The tour upon toft_, quath hue,
  Treuthe ys therynne.
                 (Passus Secundus, ed. Whit.)

Where there is an evident reference to the "tour on a toft," which has been
previously mentioned in the more correct text.

43, 44. Dr. Whitaker, misunderstanding this passage, has printed 'ther' for
'that,' which is in all the MSS. In his gloss, he interprets 'wonnen' by
'to dwell;' and he paraphrases the sentence, 'some destroying themselves by
gluttony and excess,' translating it, I suppose, "And there dwell wasters
whom gluttony destroyeth." The meaning is, the ploughmen worked hard, "and
obtained (wan) that which wasters destroy with their gluttony." The writer
of the second Trin. Coll. MS. seems to have understood the meaning of the
passage, but not the words, and has 'whom that thise wastours.'

68. I have here to preserve the alliteration, adopted 'giltles,' from the
second Trin. Coll. MS., and one of the printed editions, in place of
'synneles,' which the other MS. has. Though we find instances of
irregularity in the sub-letters (or alliterative letters in the first line)
in Pierce Plowman, the chief letter is not so often neglected. In
Whitaker's text the account of the minstrels is very confused. Here the
minstrels get gold by their song without sin, but the japers and janglers
are condemned as getting their living by what is afterwards called
'turpiloquium,' when they had ability to get it in an honester way.

88. _Roberdes knaves._ These are the same class of malefactors who are
named _Roberdesmen_ in the Statutes, 5 Ed. III. c. 14. "Et diverses
roberies, homicides, et felonies ont este faitz eintz ces heures par gentz
qui sont appellez Roberdesmen, Wastours, et Draghelatche, si est acorde et
establi que si homme eit suspecion de mal de nuls tielx, soit-il de jour
soit-il de nuyt, que meintenant soient arestus par les conestables des
villes." This law was confirmed by 7 Ric. II. c. 5, where the word is again
introduced. Whitaker supposes, without any reason, the 'Roberdes knaves' to
be Robin Hood's men. The other Trin. Coll. MS. reads _Robertis knaves_.

93. _Seint Jame._ St. James of Compostello was a famous resort of pilgrims
in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. An amusing song on the
inconveniences which attended the voyage is printed in the Reliquiae
Antiquae, vol. i, p. 2.

107. _Walsyngham._ The shrine of the Virgin Mary at Walsingham in Norfolk,
also enjoyed an extraordinary celebrity, as a resort of English pilgrims.
It appears that the first complaints of the Wicliffite reformers were
strongly expressed against this pilgrimage. "Lolardi sequaces Johannis
Wiclif ... praedicaverunt peregrinationes non debere fieri, et praecipue
apud Walsingham," etc. Th. Walsingh. p. 340.

116. The four orders of friars were, of course, the Franciscans,
Augustines, Dominicans, and Carmelites.

131. These four lines stand thus in Whitaker's text, _Bote holy churche and
charite | choppe a-doun swich shryvers, | the moste myschif of molde |
mounteth up faste._ Whitaker has translated it quite wrong, "May true
charity and church discipline knock down these, the greatest pests on
earth, who are rapidly increasing!" The simple meaning of the passage, as
given by Whitaker, is, "Unless holy church and charity chop down such
shrivers (confessors), the greatest mischief of the world is increasing
fast." The present text affords a better and equally clear meaning, "Unless
holy church and they hold better together, the greatest mischief in the
world is increasing, or gaining ground very fast."

141. _of falshede of fastynge_, the comma has slipped in by accident. The
meaning is "of breaking fast-days."

147. _He bunchith hem_, MS. Trin. 2.

168. _the pestilence tyme._ See further on, the note on l. 2497. The great
plague of 1349 and 1350 had carried off so much people, that hands were
wanting to cultivate the lands in many parishes, and the distress which
followed, with the failure of tithes which naturally accompanied it, drove
the parsons to plead poverty as an excuse for going to London and seeking
other occupations.

192. Whitaker's text inserts the following passage between this line and
the one following:--

  Conscience cam and acusede hem,
  And the commune herde hit,
  And seide, "Ydolatrie ye soffren
  In sondrye places menye,
  And boxes ben y-set forth
  Bounden with yren,
  To undertake the tool
  Of untrewe sacrifice,
  In menynge of miracles
  Muche wex hongeth there,
  Al the worldle wot wel
  Hit myghte nat be trywe.
  Ac for it profitith yow to pors-warde,
  Ye prelates soffren
  That lewede men in mysbylyve
  Leven and deien.
  Ich lyve wel, by oure Lorde!
  For love of youre covetyse,
  That al the worlde be the wors;
  As holy wryght telleth
  What cheste and meschaunce
  To children of Israel
  Ful on hem that free were,
  Thorwe two false preestes.
  For the synne of Ophni
  And of Finees hus brother,
  Thei were disconfit in bataille,
  And losten _Archa Dei_,
  And fore hure syre sauh hem syngen,
  And aoffred hem don ylle,
  And noght chasted hem therof,
  And wolde noght rebukie hem,
  Anon as it was y-told hyme
  That the children of Israel
  Weren disconfit in bataille,
  And _Archa Dei_ y-lore,
  And hus sones slayen,
  Anon he ful for sorwe
  Fro hus chaire thare he sat,
  And brak hus necke a-tweyne;
  And al was for venjaunce
  That he but noght hus children.
  And for they were preestes,
  And men of holy churche,
  God was well wrother,
  And toke the rather venjaunce.
  For-thei ich seye, ye preestes,
  And men of holy churche,
  That soffren men do sacrifice
  And worsheppen mawmettes,
  And ye sholde be here fadres,
  And techen hem betere;
  God shal take venjaunce
  In alle swiche preestes
  Wel harder and grettere,
  On suche shrewede faderes,
  Than ever he dude on Ophni
  And Finees, or in here fadere.
  For youre shrewede suffraunce,
  And youre owen synne,
  Youre masse and youre matynes,
  And meny of youre houres, etc.

225. This is the constitutional principle which was universally
acknowledged by our early political writers, and of which some strong
declarations will be found in my "Political Songs" (published by the Camden
Society). The doctrine of "right divine" was certainly not a prevalent one
in the middle ages.

291. This fable appears to be of middle-age formation, for it is not found
in any of the ancient collections. It does not occur in the fables of
Marie. It is however found in the old collection, in French verse of the
fourteenth century, entitled Ysopet; and M. Robert has also printed a Latin
metrical version of the story from a MS. of the same century. La Fontaine
has given it among his fables. It may be observed that the fable is nowhere
so well told as in Piers Ploughman. (See Robert, Fables Inedites, des
xii^e, xiii^e, et xiv^e siecles, i, pp. 98-101.) The readers of Scottish
history will remember the application of this fable in 1481, by the earl of
Angus (popularly named, from this circumstance, Archibald Bell-the-cat), in
the conspiracy against the royal favourites, which forms an excellent
illustration of our text.

381. _Vae terrae, etc._ Ecclesiastes, x, 16. "Vae tibi, terra, cujus rex
puer est, et cujus principes mane comedunt."

423. _and pointeth the lawe._ MS. Trin. 2.

429. after this line the following are inserted in the second MS. of Trin.
Coll.

  I saugh bisshopis bolde,
  And bacheleris of devyn,
  Become clerkis of acountis
  The king for to serve,
  Archideknes and denis,
  That dignites haven,
  To preche the peple
  And pore men to fede,
  Ben y-lope to Lundone
  Be leve of hire bisshop,
  And ben clerkis of the kinges bench
  The cuntre to shende.

438. _Taillours, tanneris, | And tokkeris bothe._ MS. Trin. 2.

453. The Cottonian MS. Vespas. B. xvi, from which Price has given a long
extract in his edition of Warton, has here "With wyne of Oseye | and wyn of
Gascoyne." Whitaker's reading is "Whit wyn of Oseye and of Gascoyne." Price
observes, in a note, "good wyne of Gaskyne, and the wyne of Osee [is the
reading of MS. Harl. No. 875].--The same hand already noticed has corrected
_wyn_ to _weyte_ (wheat) _of Gascoyne_;--an obvious improvement." I by no
means partake in this opinion: _wine_ of Gascony, and _not wheat_ of
Gascony, is perpetually alluded to in the literature of France and England
from the twelfth to the sixteenth century. The reading of the text now
printed is evidently the original one, which has been corrupted in the
others: the wine more particularly known as Gascon, was a red wine. The
writer of "La Desputoison du Vin et de l'Iaue," says of it--

  Vin de Gascoigne, sa coulour
  N'est pas de petite valour;
  Les autres vins fet honnorer.
  Quant de soi les veult coulourer:
  Force donne, aide, et confort,
  Et d'un vin foible, fet. i. fort.
  Il a de vin plaine sustance;
  Il nourrist sans faire grevance:
  Aus testes est bons et au flanc.
  Et du rouge y a et du blanc.
  (_Jubinal, Nouveau Recueil de Contes, &c._, i. 399.)

The 'wyn of the Rochel' (vin de la Rochelle) was also a favourite wine.--

  Rochelle, qui tant a de pris,
  Que l'en la va de partout querre;
  Chascun si l'enclot et l'enserre,
  Car il n'est pas a garconner,
  N'en ne la doit q'aus bons donner;--
  Por les grans seignors l'en salache.
                              (_ib._ p. 300).

The "wyn of Oseye" (vin d'Osaie) was a foreign wine, very rare and dear,
and sought up by 'gourmands:' it is mentioned with those of Malvoisia,
Rosetta, and Muscadet. (Depping Reglemens sur les Arts et Metiers de Paris,
p. lxiii.) It is unnecessary to explain what was 'wyn of the Ryn' (Rhine).

456. _of the Reule | and of the Rochel._ Whitaker.

458. These two lines, omitted in the MS. from which our text is printed,
have been added from MS. Trin. 2.

489. _fyve wittes._ The five wits were equivalent to the five _senses_. One
of the characters in the early interlude of The Four Elements, a production
of the earlier part of the sixteenth century, says:--

  I am callyd Sensuall Apetyte,
  All craturs in me delyte;
  I comforte the _wyttys fyve_,
  The tastyng, smellyng, and herynge,
  I refresh the syght and felynge,
  To all creaturs alyve.

Stephen Hawes, in his Pastime of Pleasure (chap. xxiv), belonging to this
same age, refines upon this notion, and talks of five "internall wittes,"
answering to the five external wits, or to those which were commonly
understood by that name.

522. Genesis xix, 32. It is very singular that this story of Lot and his
daughters was the favourite example of the medieval preachers against
drunkenness.

563. Luke xx, 25.

595. _on an eller._ It was the prevailing belief during the middle ages,
that the tree on which Judas hanged himself was an elder. Maundevile tells
us that this tree was still in existence, when he visited Jerusalem. "Also
streghte from Natatorie Siloe is an ymage of ston and of olde auncyen werk,
that Absalon leet make; and because thereof, men clepen it the hond of
Absalon. And faste by is yit the _tree of eldre_ that Judas henge himself
upon for despeyr that he hadde, whan he solde and betrayed oure Lord." The
same notion continued to exist in the age of Shakespeare, and is alluded to
by Shakespeare himself, Ben Jonson, and others.

  _Hol._ What mean you, sir?

  _Boyet._ To make Judas hang himself.

  _Hol._ Begin, sir; you are _my elder_.

  _Biron._ Well followed: _Judas was hang'd on an elder._

                                              _Love's Labours Lost_, v, 2.

681. _Lucifer with legions._ The story of Lucifer's rebellion and fall was
extremely popular in the middle ages, and particularly among the
Anglo-Saxons, who, in the fine poem ascribed to Caedmon, had given it
almost as much detail as Milton had done at a later date. This legend is
related in prose in an Anglo-Saxon tract in MS. Cotton. Vespas. D. xiv,
fol. 2.

682. The second Trin. Col. MS. has, _Leride it in hevene, | and as the
lovelokest | to loke on, aftir oure Lord_.

697-704. Instead of these lines, we find the following in Whitaker's text:

  Lord, why wolde he tho,
  Thulke wrechede Lucifer,
  Lepen on a-lofte
  In the northe syde,
  To sitten in the sonne side
  Ther the day roweth,
  Ne were it for northerne men,
  Anon ich wolde telle:
  Ac ich wolle lacke no lyf,
  Quath that lady sotthly.
  'Hyt is sykerer by southe,
  Ther the sonne regneth,
  Than in the north, by meny notes,
  No man loyne other.
  For theder as the fend flegh,
  Hus fote for to sette,
  Ther he failede and fuel,
  And hus felawes alle.
  And helle is ther he is,
  And he ther y-bounde,
  Evene contrarie suteth Criste,
  Cierkus knowen the sothe,
  _Dixit Dominus Domino meo, sede a dextris
      meis._
    'Ac of this matere
  No more mene ich nelle,
  He was in the halyday
  After heten wayten,
  They care noght thauh it be cold
  Knaves wen thei worchen.'

Whitaker has translated the last four lines of the foregoing extract thus,
"Excepting that hyndes on the holyday look out for warm places, but knaves
(servants) when working hard, are indifferent to cold."

695. Isaiah xiv, 14. The citation varies a little from the text of the
printed vulgate.

707. _Somme in the eyr._ The monks in the middle ages endeavoured to
explain the existence of different classes of spirits and fairies, which
the popular creed represented as harmless, or even beneficent creatures, by
supposing that some of the angels who fell with Lucifer were less guilty
than others, and were allowed to occupy the different elements on the earth
instead of being condemned to "the pit." In "The Master of Oxford's
Catechism," written early in the fifteenth century, and printed in the
Reliquiae Antiquae, vol. i, p. 231, we have the following question and
answer,--"_C._ Where be the anjelles that God put out of heven, and bycam
devilles? _M._ Som into hell, and som reyned in the skye, and som in the
erth, and som in waters and in wodys."

815. Mark iv, 24. In qua mensura mensi fueritis, remetietur vobis, et
adjicietur vobis.

835. Epist. Jac. ii, 17. Sic et fides, si non habeat opera, mortua est in
semetipsa.

862. Luke vi, 38.

901. The second Trin. Col. MS. has--

  Frettid with rynges,
  Of the pureste perreighe
  That prince werde evere,
  In red scarlet robid
  And ribande with gold.
  Ther nis no quen queyntere
  That quyk is o-lyve,
  'What is this womman,' quod I.

934. Matth. vii, 17. _bonus_ (for _bona_) is the reading of the MS. Perhaps
it was thought allowable to use the masculine thus before a fem. noun
beginning with _a_, for the sake of euphony, as the French still write _mon
amie_, instead of _ma amie_, and the like. Whitaker's text has here--

  _Talis pater, talis filius._
  For shal never brere bere
  Beries as a vyne,
  No on crokyd kene thorne
  Kynde fygys wexe.
  _Bona arbor bonum fructum facit._

The lines which follow differ considerably in the two texts.

958. Psalm xiv, 1.

991-994. Instead of these lines, the following are substituted in the
second Trin. Coll. MS.:--

  Sire Symonye is assent
  To asele the chartres,
  That Fals and Favel
  Be any fyn halden,
  And feffe Mede therwith
  In mariage for evere.
  Ther nas halle ne hous
  To herberwe the peple,
  That iche feld nas ful
  Of folk al aboute.
  In myddis a mounteyne
  At myd-morewe tide
  Was pight up a pavyloun
  Proud for the nones,
  And ten thousand of tentis
  Teldit beside,
  Of knightes of cuntres,
  Of comeres aboute,
  For sisours, for somonours, etc.

And the rest, as far as line 1100, differs very much in the two MSS.

1103. _of Banneburies sokne, | Reynald the reve, | and the redyngkynges
menye, | Munde the mylnere._ Whit.

1128. Luke x, 7.

1177. _With floryns ynowe._ Edward III had issued, not very long before the
date of this poem, the first extensive English gold coinage, to which he
gave the Italian name of florins, derived originally from that of the city
of Florence.

1204. _to Westmynstre_: _i. e._ to the courts of law which were held there.

1404. _A moton of golde._ A mutton (mouton) was a small French coin of
gold, which bore the stamp of a lamb or sheep. See Ducange, v. _Multo_.

1501. Matth. vi, 3.

1523. Regrating, or the buying up of provisions and other things to make
extravagant profits by retailing them, was one of the great sources of
oppression of the poor by the rich in the middle ages, and was a constant
subject of popular complaint.

1529. Whitaker's text adds here,--

  Thei have no puteye of the puple
  That parcel-mele mote biggen,
  Thauh thei take hem untydy thyng,
  Thei hold it no treson;
  And thauh thei fulle nat ful,
  That for lawe y-seelde,
  He gripeth therfor as grete
  As for the grete treuthe.

    Meny sondry sorwes

  And greveth hem wrongliche,

  That Christ hem avenge

  Other elles on helle,
  That so bygyleth hem of here good,
  And God on hem sendeth
  Feveres, other fouler hyveles,
  Other fur on here houses,

  And menye tyme hit falleth,

  And have here penaunce on pure erthe,
  And noght in the pyne of helle.
  And thenne falleth the fur
  On false menne houses,

2175-2186. The variation in Whitaker's text deserves notice. This passage
there stands as follows:--

  Thenne cam Pees into parlement,
  And putte up a bylle.
  How that Wrong wilfullich
  Hadde hus wif for-leyen;
  And how he ravysed Rose,
  The riche widewe, by nyghte;
  And Margarete of here maidenhod,
  As he met hure late.
  'Both my goos, and my grys,
  And my gras he taketh,

  In faith!' Pees saide,
  'Bere sickerlich eny selver
  To seint Gyles doune;

  Wel yerne he aspieth,
  To robbe me and to ryfle me,

  Yut he is bolde for to borwe,
  And baldelich he payeth:

2177. _How Wrong ayeins his wille._ What follows is a true picture of the
oppressions to which the peasantry were frequently subjected by the king's
purveyors, and by others in power. See the Political Songs, pp. 377, 378;
and Hartshorne's Ancient Metrical Tales, pp. 41, 42.

2197. _taille_, a tally. See the Political Songs, as above quoted. Whitaker

2335. _Galis._ Compostello in Galicia.

2473. _Passus Quintus._ In Whitaker's text, this section, which is called
_Passus Sextus_, is prefaced by the following long exordium, intended as a
satire against the mendicant friars:--

  Thus ich awaked, God wot!
  Wanne ich wonede on Cornhulle,
  Kytte and ich in a cote,
  Clothede as a lollere:
  And a lytel ich let by,
  Leyve me, for sothe,
  Among lolleres of London,
  And lewede heremytes.
  For ich made of tho men,
  As Reson me tauhte.
  For as ich cam by Conscience,
  Wit Reson ich mette,
  In an hote hervest,
  Wenne ich hadde myn hele,
  And lymes to labore with,
  And lovede wel fare,
  And no dede to do
  Bote drynke and to slepe,
  In hele and in unite,
  On me aposede,
  Romynge in remembraunce.
  Thus Reson me arated:
  'Canstow serven,' he seide,
  'Other syngen in a churche?
  Other loke for my cokers?
  Other to the carte picche?
  Mowe, other mowen,
  Other make bond to sheves?
  Repe, other be a repe-reyve
  And arise erliche?
  Other have an horne and be hay-warde,
  And liggen out a nyghtes,
  And kepe my corn in my croft
  From pykers and theeves?
  Other shap shoon other clothes?
  Other shep other kyne kepe?
  Eggen, other harwen,
  Other swyne other gees dryve?
  Other eny kyne craft
  That to the comune nudeth,
  Hem that bed-reden be
  Bylyve to fynde?'
    'Certes,' ich seyde,
  'And so me God helpe!
  Ich am to waik to worche
  With sykel other with sythe;
  And to long, leyf me,
  Lowe for to stoupe,
  To worchen as workeman
  Eny wyle to dure.'
  'Then havest thow londes to lyve by,'
  Quath Reson, 'other lynage ryche
  That fynden the thy fode?
  For an hydel man thow semest,
  A spendour that spende mot,
  Other a spille-tyme;
  Other beggest thy lyve

  Other faitest upon Fridays
  Other feste dayes in churches;
  The wiche is lollerene lyf,
  That lytel is preysed
  Ther ryghtfulnesse rewardeth
  Ryght as men deserveth.
  _Reddit unicuique juxta opera sua._
  Ether thow ert broke, so may be,
  In body other in membre,
  Other y-maymed thorow som myshap.
  Werby thow myght be excusede.'
  'Wanne ich yong was,' quath ich,
  'Many yer hennes,
  My fader and my frendes
  Founden me to scole,
  Tyl ich wiste wyterliche
  Wat holy wryt menede,
  And wat is best for the body,
  As the bok telleth,
  And sykerest for the soule,
  By so ich wolle continue.
  And yut fond ich never in faith,
  Sytthen my frendes deyden,
  Lyf that me lyked,
  Bote in thes long clothes.
  Hyf ich by laboure sholde lyf,
  And lyflode deserven,
  That labour that ich lerned best
  Therwhit lyve ich sholde.
  _In eadem vocatione qua vocati estis._
  And ich lyve in Londene
  And on Londen bothe.
  The lomes that ich laboure with
  And lyflode deserve,
  Ys paternoster and my prymer,
  _Placebo et dirige_,
  And my sauter some tyme,
  And my sevene psalmes.
  Thus ich synge for hure soules
  Of suche as me helpen.
  And tho that fynden me my fode

  And thus gate ich begge
  Withoute bagge other botel,

  And also, moreover,
  Me thynketh, syre Reson,
  Men sholde constreyne
  No clerke to knavene werkes.
  For by law of Livitici,

  Clerkes that aren crowned
  Of kynde understondyng,

  _Nou reddas malum pro malo._
  For it ben aires of hevene,
  And alle that ben crounede
  And in queer in churches,

  _Dominus pars haereditatis meae
    Et alibi, Clementia non constringit._
  Hit bycometh for clerkus
  Crist for to serven;
  And knaves uncrounede
  To cart and to worche.
  For shold no clerk be crouned,
  Bote yf he y-come were
  Of franklens and freemen
  And of folke y-weddede.
  Bondmen and bastardes,
  And beggers children,
  Thuse bylongeth to labour.
  And lordes children sholde serven,
  Bothe God and good men,
  As here degree asketh;
  Some to synge masses,

  That Reson oughte spende.
  And sith bondemenne barnes

  For selver han be knyghtes,

  For the ryght of the reame,

  Lyf-holynesse and love
  Han ben longe hennes,
  And wole, til hit be wered out,
  Or otherwise y-chaunged.
  For-thy rebuke me ryht nouht,
  Reson, ich yow praye;
  For in my conscience ich knowe
  What Crist wolde that ich wroughte.
  Preyers of perfyt man,
  And penaunce discret,
  Is the levest labour
  That oure Lord pleseth.
  _Non de solo_, ich seyde,
  For sothe _vivit homo,
  Nec in pane et pabulo_,
  The paternoster witnesseth.
  _Fiat voluntas tua_
  Fynt ous alle thynges.'
  Quath Conscience, 'By Crist!
  Ich can nat see this lyeth.
  Ac it semeth nouht perfitnesse
  In cyties for to begge,
  Bote he be obediencer
  To pryour other to mynstre.'
  'That ys soth,' ich seide,
  'And so ich by-knowe
  That ich have tynt tyme,
  And tyme mys-spended.
  And yut ich hope, as he
  That ofte haveth chaffarede,
  That ay hath lost and lost,
  And at the latest hym happeth
  He bouhte suche a bargayn
  He was the bet evere,
  And sette hus lost at a lef
  At the laste ende;

  _Simile est regnum coelorum thesauro

    _Mulier quae inveniet dragmam, etc._
  So hope ich to have of hym
  That his almyghty
  A gobet of hus grace,
  And bygynne a tyme
  That alle tymes of my tyme
  To profit shal turne.'
  'Ich rede the,' quath Reson tho,
  'Rathe the to bygynne
  The lyf that ys lowable
  And leel to the soule.'
  'Ye, and continue,' quath Conscience.
  And to the church ich wente.
    And to the church gan ich go,

  Knocked ich my brest,

  Of the mater that ich mete fyrst

  And Reson revested
  Ryght as a pope,
  And Conscience his crocer
  Byfore the kynge stande.
  Reson reverentliche
  Byfor all the reame
  Prechede and provede
  That thuse pestilences
  Was for pure synne, etc.
      _See_ l. 2497, of the present edition.

2497. _thise pestilences._--There were three great pestilences in the reign
of Edward III, the terrible effects of which were long fresh in people's
minds, and they were often taken as points from which to date common
events. Two of them had passed at the period when the Visions of Piers
Ploughman are believed to have been written, and are the ones here alluded
to. Of the first, or great pestilence, which lasted from 31 May, 1348, to
29 Sept. 1349, the contemporary chroniclers give a fearful account. In a
register of the Abbey of Gloucester (MS. Cotton. Domit. A. VIII, fol. 124),
we have the following entry:--"Anno Domini m^o.ccc^o.xlviij^o. anno vero
regni regis Edwardi III, post conquestum xxij^o. incepit magna pestilentia
in Anglia, ita quod _vix tertia pars_ hominum remansit." This pestilence,
known as the _black plague_, ravaged most parts of Europe, and is said to
have carried off in general about two-thirds of the people. It was the
pestilence which gave rise to the Decameron of Boccaccio. For an
interesting account of it, see Michelet's Hist. de France, iii, 342-349.
The second pestilence lasted from 15 Aug. 1361, to May 3, 1362, and was
much less severe. The third pestilence raged from 2 July to 29 September,
1369.

2500. _The south-westrene wynd | on Saterday at even._ Tyrwhitt, in his
Preface to Chaucer, first pointed out the identity of this wind with the
one mentioned by the old chroniclers (Thorn, Decem. Script. col. 2122;
Walsingham, p. 178; the continuator of Adam Murimuth, p. 115), as occurring
on the evening of Jan. 15, 1362. The fifteenth of January in that year was
a Saturday. The following is the account given by Walsingham: "Anno gratiae
millesimo trecentesimo sexagesimo secundo, qui est annus regni regis
Edwardi a conquestu tertii tricesimus sextus, tenuit rex natale apud
Wyndesor, et quinto decimo die sequente ventus vehemens, nothus auster
affricus, tanta vi erupit, quod flatu suo domos altas, aedificia sublimia,
turres, et campanilia, arbores, et alia quaeque durabilia et fortia
violenter prostravit pariter et impegit, in tantum quod residua quae modo
extant, sunt hactenus infirmiora." The continuator of Murimuth is more
particular as to the time of the day, and in other respects more exact.
"A.D. m. ccc. lxii, xv die Januarii, _circa horam vesperarum_, ventus
vehemens notus australis affricus tanta rabie erupit," etc.

2529. _And fecche Felis his wyf | Fro wyuene pyne._ MS. Trin. Col. 2.

2547. This was a very old and very common proverb in England. Thus in the
Proverbs of Hending (Reliquiae Antiquae, vol. i, p. 110):--

  Ne bue thi child never so duere,
  Ant hit wolle unthewes lerne,
    Bet hit other whyle;
  Mote hit al habben is wille,
  Woltou nultou hit wolle spille,
    Ant bicome a fule.
  _Luef child lore byhoveth_;
              Quoth Hendyng.

The proverb is a little varied in another copy of these "Proverbs," p. 194
of the same work. There is a German proverb closely resembling it, "Je
lieberes Kind, je schaerfere Ruthe."

2551. Prov. xiii, 24.

2569. After this line Whitaker's text has inserted a passage, answering
nearly word for word (except in the few first lines) to the passage in our
text, ll. 6218-6274.

2573. In the same text, the following lines are here added:--

  'And also,' quath Reson,
  'Ich rede yow, riche
  And comuners, to acorden
  In alle kynne treuthe.
  Let no kynne consail
  Ne covetyze yow departe,
  That on wit and on wil
  Alle youre wardes kepe.
  Lo! in hevene on hy
  Was an holy comune,
  Til Lucifer the lyere
  Leyved that hymselve
  Were wittyour and worthiour
  Than he that was hus maister.
  Hold yow in unite.
  And ye that hother wolde
  Is cause of alle combraunce
  To confounde a reame.

2586. Matt. xxv, 12.

2594. Whitaker's _Passus Sextus_ ends with this line.

2625. Before Envy's confession, and in the place of Lechery, Whitaker's
text introduces the confession of Pride--

  Ich, Pruyde, patientliche
  Penaunce ich aske;
  For ich formest and ferst
  To fader and to moder
  Have y-be unboxome,
  Ich beseche God of mercy;
  And unboxome y-be,
  Nouht abaissed to agulte
  God and alle good men,
  So gret was myn herte;
  Inobedient to holy churche,
  And to hem that ther serven,
  Demed for hure yvel vices,
  And excited othere
  Thorw my word and al my wit
  Hure yvel workes to shewe;
  And scorned hem and othere,
  Yf a skyle founde,
  Lauhynge al aloude,
  For lewede men sholde
  Wene that ich were witty
  And wyser than anothere;
  Scorner and unskilful to hem
  That skil shewede,
  In all manere manners
  My name to be y-knowe,
  Semeng a sovereyn on,
  Wer so me byfulle
  To telle eny tale.
  Ich trowede me wiser
  To carpen other to counsaile
  Than eny, lered other lewede.
  Proud of aparail
  In porte amonge the puple,
  Otherwise than ich have,
  Withynne other withoute,
  Me wilnede that men wende
  Ich were in aveyr
  Riche and resonable,
  And ryghtful of lyvynge;
  Bostynge and braggynge
  Wyt meny bolde othes;
  Avauntyng upon my veine glorie
  For eny undernemynge;
  And yut so syngeler by myself
  Ne non so pomp holy,
  Som tyme on a secte,
  Sam tyme on another;
  In all kynne covetyse
  Contrevede how ich myghte
  Be holde for holy,
  And hondred sithe by that encheison;
  Wilnede that men wende
  My werkes were the beste
  And konnygest of my craft,
  Clerkes other othere,
  And strengest upon my stede,
  And styvest under gurdell,
  And lovelokest to loken on,
  And lykyngest a-bedde;
  And lykynge of such a lif
  That no lawe preyseth;
  Proud of my faire fetours;
  And for ich songe shrille;
  And what ich gaf for Godes love,
  To godsybbes ich tolde,
  Ther to wene that ich were
  Wel holy and wel almesful.
  And non so bold begger
  To bydden an[d] crave,
  Tales to telle
  In tavernes and in stretes,
  Thyng that nevere was thouhte,
  And yut ich swor ich sauh hit,
  And lyed on my lykame
  And on my lyf bothe.
  Of werkes that ich wel dude
  Witnesse ich take,
  And syggen to such
  That sytten me bysyde,
  'Lo! yf ye leyve me nouht,
  Other that ye wene ich lye,
  Ask of hym other of hure,
  And thei conne yow telle
  What ich soffrede an[d] seih,
  And som tyme hadde,
  And what ich knew and couthe,
  Of wat kyn ich kam of;
  Al ich wolde that men wuste,
  When it to pruyde sonede,
  As to preised among the puple,
  Thauh ich povre semede.'
  _Si hominibus placerem, Christi servus
      non essem. Nemo potest duobus
      dominis servire._
  'Now God, of hus goodnesse,
  Geve the grace to amende!'
  Quath Repentaunce ryght with that;
  And thenne roos Envye.

The description of Envy, which follows, is shorter in Whitaker's text, and
differs much from our text.

2819-2822. The discipline here described seems to have been peculiar to the
chapter-house of the monasteries. Matth. Paris, p. 848, has an anecdote
which illustrates curiously this passage of Piers Ploughman. In speaking of
the turbulent Falcasius de Breute, who had been warned in a vision to offer
himself to suffer penance in the monastery of St. Albans, in the reign of
Henry III, he says, "Vestibus igitur spoliatus cum suis militibus,
similiter indumentis spoliatis, ferens in manu virgam quam vulgariter
_baleis_ appellamus, et confitens culpam suam, ... a singulis fratribus
disciplinas nuda carne suscepit."

2846. In the text which Whitaker has printed, the confession of Wrath was
followed by that of Luxury or Lechery. It stands as follows in the copy of
the same text in MS. Cotton. Vespas. B. xvi. (_See_ l. 8713, of our present
text.)

  Thanne seide Lecherie, Alas!
  And to oure Ladi criede,
  'Ladi, for thi leve sone,
  Loute for me nouthe,
  That he have pite on me, putour,
  For his pure merci.'
  'With that I schal,' quod that schrewe,
  'Saterdaies, for thi love,
  Drynke with the doke,
  And dine but ones.'
    I, gulti in gost,
  To God I me schrive,
  As in likyng of lecherige
  My licames gultes,
  In wordes, in wedes,
  In waityng of eyen,
  To eche maide that I mette
  I made here a sigge,
  Semyng to synne-ward,
  And summe can I taste
  Aboute the mouth, and binethe
  Bigon I to grope,
  Til bothe oure wil was on,
  To werke we yeden,
  As wel fastyng daies,
  And hi festes eves,
  And wel in Lente as out of Lente,
  Al tymes i-liche;
  Swiche werkes with us
  Weren nevere out of seson,
  Til we mighten ne more,
  Tho hadde we muri tales
  Of putrige and of paramours,
  And provede thorw speche,
  Handelyng, and halsyng,
  And also thorw cussyng,
  Excityng heither other
  To oure elde synne;
  Sotilde songes,
  And sente out elde baudes
  For te wynne to my wil
  Wemmen with gile;
  Bi sorcerie sum time,
  And sum time be maistrie,
  I lai bi the lovelokest,
  And lovede hem nevere aftur.
    Whan I was eld and hor,
  And hadde i-lorn that kynde,
  I hadde likyng to lige
  Of lecherous tales.
  Now, lord, for thi lewte,
  On lecheres have merci.

2850. _Sire Hervy._ Whitaker and Price (in Warton) suppose that there is
here a personal allusion, which at the time had become proverbial.

2874. _Symme at the Style._ Whit.

2881. _To Wy and to Wynchestre | I wente to the feyre._ Warton (Hist. of
Eng. p. ii, 55, edit. 1840) supposes Wy to be Weyhill, in Hampshire, "where
a famous fair still subsists." In fact it is one of the greatest fairs in
England, lasting ten days. For anecdotes of the celebrity of the great fair
at Winchester in former times, and for some interesting observations on
fairs in general, _see_ Warton, loc. cit.

2933. _The Roode of Bromholm._ At the Priory of Bromholm, in Norfolk, there
was a celebrated cross, said to be made of fragments of the real cross, and
much resorted to by pilgrims. It was brought from Constantinople to England
in 1223. The history of this cross, and the miracles said to have been
performed by it at Bromholm, are told by Matthew Paris (p. 268). In the MS.
Chronicle of Barthol. de Cotton, it is recorded at the date 1223, "Eo
tempore Peregrinatio de Bromholm incepit."

2949. _Frensshe ... of Northfolk._ Norfolk, it would appear by this, was
one of the least refined parts of the island.

3030. In this part of the poem, the smaller variations between the present
text and Whitaker's are very numerous. After this line, the following
passage is inserted:--

  With false wordes and writes
  Ich have wonne my goodes,
  And with gyle and glosynge
  Gadered that ich have;
  Meddled my merchaundise,
  And mad a good moustre,
  The werst lay withynne,
  A gret wit ich let hit.
  And yf my neyhgebore had an hyne,
  Other eny best ellys,
  More profitable than myn,
  Ich made meny wentes,
  How ich myght have hit
  Al my wit ich caste;
  And bote ich hadde hit by othes away,
  At last ich stal hit,
  Other pryvyliche hus pors shok,
  Unpiked his lokes.
  And yf ich yede to the plouh,
  Ich pynchede on hus half acre,
  That a fot londe other a forwe
  Fetchen ich wolde
  Of my neyhgeboris next,
  Nymen of hus erthe,
  And yf y repe, over reche,
  Other gaf hem red that repen
  To sese to me with here sykel,
  That ich sewe nevere.
  In haly dayes at holy churche

  In the meyn time,

  Ne othere manere syghtes,
  And nevere penaunce performede,

  Than in Godes grace,
  And hus grete myghte.

3039. Psa. l, 8.

3083. The confessions of the robber and the glutton are reversed in
Whitaker's text, and present many variations. The robber's confession is
there preceded by the following curious lines:--

  Then was ther a Walishman
  That was wonderlich sory,
  He hight Yyvan Yeld ageyn;
  'If ich so moche have,
  Al that ich wickedlich wan
  Setthen ich hit hadde;
  And thauh my liflode lache
  Leten ich nelle
  That ech man shal have hus,
  Er ich hennes wende.
  For me ys levere in this lif
  As a lorel beggen,
  Than in lysse to lyve,
  And lese lyf and soule.'

3162. Between this line and the next, MS. Trin. Col. 2, inserts _Bargoynes
and beverechis | Begonne for to arise._

3277, 3278. _rymes of Robyn Hood | and Randolf erl of Chestre._ This seems
to be the earliest mention of the ballads of Robin Hood which can now be
found. Ritson was quite mistaken (Robin Hood, Introd. p. xlix) in the
supposed mention of him by the prior of Alnwick, the title of the Latin
song being modern. The passage of Fordun, in which Robin Hood is spoken of,
is probably an interpolation.

I am not sure that Ritson is right in taking the _Randolf erl of Chester_
of Piers Ploughman, to be Ranulf de Blundevile: it is quite as probable
that he was the Ranulf of Chester of the days of Stephen, whose turbulent
deeds may have been the subject of popular ballads. Warton (H. E. P. ii,
373), quoting the passage of Piers Ploughman with the word _erl_ omitted,
conceives it to mean Ralph Higden, and imagines the _rymes_ to be the
Chester Mysteries, of which he conjectured that Ralph Higden was the
author.

3311. _Ite missa est._ The concluding sentence of the service of the Mass.

3408. _the Rode of Chestre._ There was a celebrated cross or rood at
Chester, which was long an object of great veneration, and even of
pilgrimage, among our Roman Catholic forefathers. "I do not recollect any
thing remarkable (says Mr. Pennant, speaking of Chester) on the outside of
the walls which has been unnoticed, unless it be the Rood-eye, and the
adjacent places."--"The name of this spot is taken from _eye_, its watery
situation, and rood, the cross which stood there, whose base is still to be
seen." Pennant's Tour in Wales, edit. 1778, p. 191. According to Gough's
Camden, the base was still remaining in 1789.

3410. _Roberd the robbere._ This name is rather curious in conjunction with
the term _Roberdesmen_ mentioned in the note on l. 88. It was no uncommon
practice to give punning names in this way to people or classes of people.
In a Latin song of the reign of Henry III (Political Songs, p. 49), we have
a very curious instance of it, one of the names being, as here, _Robert_:--

Competentur per _Robert_, _robbur_ designatur; Robertus excoriat,
extorquet, et minatur.-- Vir quicunque rabidus consors est Roberto.

Still earlier (12th cent.) a scribe says of one of his brothers, "Secundus
dicebatur _Robertus_, quia a re nomen habuit, _spoliator_ enim diu fuit et
_praedo_." (Polit. Songs, p. 354.)

3419. _Dysmas._ In middle-age legends, Dismas and Gestas were the names of
the two thieves who were crucified with Christ. The former was the one who
believed in the Saviour, and received a promise of paradise.

3443. Before this line, Whitaker's text has the following passage:--

  Ac whiche be the braunches
  That bryngeth me to sleuthe,
  Ys wanne a man mourneth nat
  For hus mysdedes;
  The penaunce that the prest enjoyneth
  Parfourmeth uvele;
  Doth non almys-dedes,
  And drat nat of synne:
  Lyveth ayens the byleyve,
  And no lawe kepeth;
  And hath no lykynge to lerne,
  Ne of houre Lord hure,
  Bote harlotrie other horedom,
  Other elles of som wynnyng.
  Wan men carpen of Crist
  Other of clennesse of soule,
  He wext wroth, and wol not huyre
  Bote wordes of murthe,
  Penaunce and povre men,
  The passion of seyntes,
  He hateth to huyre therof
  And alle that therof carpen.
  Thuse beth the braunches, be war,
  That bryngeth man to wanhope.
  Ye lordes and ladyes,
  And legates of holy churche,
  That feden fool sages,
  Flaterers and lyers,
  And han lykynge to lythen hem,
  In hope to do yow lawe--
  _Vae! vobis qui ridetis, etc._
  And geveth suche mede an mete,
  And povre men refusen;
  In youre deth deynge,
  Ich drede me sore
  Lest tho maner men
  To moche sorwe yow brynge.
  _Consensientes et agentes pari paena punientur._
  Patriarkes and prophetes,
  Prechours of Godes wordes,
  Saven thorgh here sermons
  Mannes soule fro helle:
  Ryght so flaterers and foles
  Aren the fendes procuratores,
  Entysen men thorgh here tales
  To synne and to harlotrie.
  Clerkus that knowen this,
  Sholde kennen lordes
  What David seide of suche men,
  As the Sauter telleth:
  _Non habitabit in medio domus meae qui
      facit superbiam, qui loquitur
      iniquum._
  Sholde non harlot have audience
  In halle ne in chaumbre,
  Ther that wys men were.
  Whitnesse of Godes wordes;
  Nother a mys-prout man
  Among lordes alouwed.
  Clerkus and knyghtes
  Wolcometh kynges mynstrales,
  For love of here lordes
  Lithen hem at festes:
  Muche more, me thenketh,
  Riche men auhte
  Have beggers byfore hem,
  Wiche beth Godes mynstreles,

  Seynt Johan berith whittnesse:
  _Qui vos spernit, me etiam spernit._
  Therfor ich rede yow, riche,
  Reveles when ye maken,
  For to solace youre soules,
  Suche mynstrales to have,
  The povre for a foul sage
  Syttynge at thy table,
  Whith a lered man to lere the
  What oure Lord suffrede,
  For to savy thy saule
  Fram Satan thyn enemye,
  And fitayle the withoute flateryng
  Of Good Friday the feste:
  And a blynde man for a bordiour,
  Other a bed-reden womman
  To crye a largesse byfor oure Lord,
  Youre good loos to shewe.
  Thuse thre manere mynstrales
  Maken a man to lauhe;
  In hus deth deyng
  Thei don hym gret comfort,
  That by hus lyfe loveth hem,
  And loveth hem to huyre.

  In a wele good hope, for he wroghte so,
  Among worthy seyntes,

  Whith here foule wordes

  With _Turpiloquio_, a lay of sorwe,
  And Lucifers fitele,

  For he litheth and loveth
  That Godes lawe despiteth.

3545. _Signes of Synay, | and shelles of Galice ... keyes of Rome._ It is
perhaps hardly necessary to remark that the articles mentioned here were
borne by the pilgrim to indicate the particular holy sites which he had
visited. The reader will readily call to mind the lines of a modern poet:--

  The summon'd Palmer came in place,
  His sable cowl o'erhung his face;
  In his black mantle was he clad,
  With _Peter's keys_ in cloth of red
    On his broad shoulders wrought;
  The _scallop shell_ his cap did deck;
  The crucifix around his neck
    Was from Loretto brought.

3622. _Seint Thomas shryne._ St. Thomas of Canterbury. It may not perhaps
be generally known that an interesting description of this shrine, when in
its glory, is given by Erasmus, Colloq. _Peregrinatio Religionis ergo._

3713. _eten apples un-rosted._ One of the many specimens of the burlesque
manner in which scripture was frequently quoted in these times. A very
singular passage (but in a tract professedly burlesque) occurs in the
Reliquiae Antiquae, vol. i, p. 83:--"Peter askud Adam a full greyt dowtfull
question, and seyd, 'Adam, Adam, why ete thu the appull unpard?' 'For
sothe,' quod he, 'for y had no wardyns fryde.'"

3826. _leven_, should be _lenen_.

3890. Luke xiv, 10.

3944, 3948. Psalm lxviii, 29.

3997. _the rode of Lukes._ The second Trin. Col. MS. has _be the rode of
Chestre._ There was a famous cross at Lucca, but whether a part of the real
cross, I have not ascertained. Calvin, in his most able and entertaining
_Admonitio de Reliquiis_, declines undertaking a list of all the places
where pieces of the real cross were shown. "Denique si congesta in acervum
essent omnia quae reperiri possent, integrum navis onus efficerent: cum
tamen evangelium testificetur ab unico homine ferri potuisse. Quantae
igitur audaciae fuit, ligneis frustis sic totum implere orbem, quibus
ferendis ne trecenti quidem homines sufficiant?" _Calvini_, _Opusc._ p.
277. There was also at Lucca one of the impressions of our Saviour's face
on the handkerchief of Veronica. The peculiar oath of William Rufus was by
the holy face at Lucca.

4027. _with hey trolly lolly._ MS. Trin. Col. 2.

4154. In the second Trin. Col. MS. the passage stands as follows:--

  Ne hadde Peris but a pese lof,
  Thei preyede hym beleve,
  And with a bene batte
  He hadde betwene,
  And hitte hunger therwith
  Amydde hise lippes,
  And blodde in it the bodyward
  A bolle ful of growel,
  Ne hadde the fisician ferst
  Defendite him watir,
  To abate the barly bred,
  And the benis y-grounde,
  Thei hadde be ded be this day,
  And dolven al warm.
  Faitours for fer, etc.

4194. _Thei corven here coppes, | and courtepies made._ Whitaker, who
translates it, "They _carved wooden cups_, and made themselves short
cloaks." It ought to be, "They cut their copes to make courtpies (a kind of
short cloaks) of them."

4242. Paul Epist. ad Galat. vi, 2.

4336. _His mawe is alongid._ MS. Trin. Coll. 2.

4336. Whitaker's text inserts here the following passage, which is curious
as containing the same word, _latchdrawers_, that occurs in Edward's
statute, quoted before in the note to l. 88:--

  Thenk that Dives for hus delicat lyf
  To the devel wente,
  And Lazar the lene beggere
  That longed after cromes,
  And yut had he hem nat,
  For ich Hunger culde hym,
  And suthe ich sauh hym sute,
  As he a syre were,
  At alle manere ese
  In Abrahame lappe.
  An yf you be of power,
  Peers, ich the rede,
  Alle that greden at thy gate
  For Godes love after fede,
  Parte wit hem of thy payn,
  Of potage and of souel,
  Lene hem som of thy loof,
  Thauh thu the lesse chewe.
  And thauh lyers and latchedrawers,
  And lolleres knocke,
  Let hem abyde tyl the bord be drawe,
  Ac bere hem none cromes,
  Tyl al thyn nedy neihebores
  Have none y-maked.

4339. _Phisik ... hise furred hodes ... his cloke of Calabre._ Whitaker
cites, in illustration of the dress of the physician, the costume still
worn by the Doctors of Medicine in the universities. Chaucer gives the
following description of the dress of the "Doctour of Phisike":--

  In sangwin and in pers he clad was al,
  Lyned with taffata, and with sendal.
                              (Cant. T. Prolog. 441.)

_Calabre_ appears to have been a kind of fur: a document in Rymer, quoted
by Ducange, speaks of an _indumentum foderatum cum Calabre_.

4390. _ripe chiries manye._ This passage, joined with the mention of
cherry-time in l. 2794, shows that cherries were a common fruit in the
fourteenth century. "Mr. Gough, in his British Topography, says that
cherries were first brought in by the Romans, but were afterwards lost and
brought in again in the time of Henry VIII, by Richard Harris, the king's
fruiterer; but this is certainly a mistake. When in the New Forest in
Hampshire in the summer of 1808, I saw a great many cherry-trees,
apparently, of much more considerable age than the time of Henry VIII. The
_very old_ trees were universally of the kind called _merries_." H. E.

4431. Cato, Distich. i, 21:--

  Infantem nudum quum te natura crearit,
  Paupertatis onus patienter ferre memento.

4453. _so seide Saturne._ See the Introduction, p. xii.

4490. Whitaker's text reads after this line:--

  Leel and ful of love,
  And no lord dreden,
  Merciable to meek,
  And mylde to the goode,
  And bytynge on badde men
  Bote yf thei wolde amende,
  And dredeth nat for no deth
  To distruye by here powere
  Lecherie among lordes,
  And hure luther custymes,
  And sithen lyve as thei lereth men,
  Oure lorde Treuthe hem graunteth,
  To be peeres to Apostles, &c.

4525. _sette scolers to scole._ It was common in the _scholastic_ ages for
scholars to wander about gathering money to support them at the
universities. In a poem in MS. Lansdowne, No. 762, the husbandman,
complaining of the many burdens he supports in taxes to the court, payments
to the church, and charitable contributions of different kinds, enumerates
among the latter the alms to scholars:--

  Than cometh clerkys of Oxford, and mak their mone,
  To her scole-hire they most have money.

4618. _the clerc of stories._ Called, elsewhere, _maister of stories_.
These names were given popularly to Peter Comestor, author of the famous
Historia Scolastica, a paraphrase of the Bible history, with abundance of
legendary matter added to it. The title given him by the author of Piers
Ploughman is not uncommon in English treatises of the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries. Lydgate, Minor Poems, p. 102 (Ed. Halliwell), speaks
of Comestor thus:--

  _Maister of storyes_, this doctour ful notable,
  Holding a chalice here in a sonne cliere.

4619. _Catons techyng._ "Cui des videto," is the twenty-third of the
"Distichorum Lemmata" of Dionysius Cato.

4621. Instead of ll. 4621-4658, the following long and curious passage is
substituted in the text adopted by Mr. Whitaker:--

  Wot no man, as ich wene,
  Who is worthy to have.
  The most needy aren oure neighebores,
  And we nyme good hede;
  As prisoners in puttes,
  And poore folke in cotes
  Charged with children
  And chef lordes rente,
  That thei spynnynge may spare,
  Spynen hit in hous hyre,
  Bothe in mylk and in mele.
  To maken with papelotes
  To aglotye with here gurles
  That greden after fode.
  Al so hemselve

  And wo in winter tyme;
  With wakyng a-nyghtes

  Othere in ryme shewe

  That wonyeth in cotes,

  And fewe pans taketh.

  Cold flesch and cold fyssh,
  For veneson y-bake.

  Theese were almes to helpe

  No rather than another.

  _Et egenos vagosque induc in domum tuam._

4695. Here again, after many verbal variations from our text, Whitaker's
text adds the following long passage, which is very curious, and well
worthy to be preserved. Whitaker calls it "one of the finest passages in
the whole poem."

  Ac eremites that enhabiten hem
  By the heye weyes,
  And in borwes among brewesters,
  And beggen in churches
  Al that holy eremytes
  Hateden and despisede,
  As rychesses and reverences
  And ryche mennes almesse.
  These lolleres, latche-draweres,
  Lewede eremytes,
  Coveyten the contrarie,
  As cotyers thei lybben,
  For hit beth bote boyes,
  Lolleres atten ale,
  Of linguage of lettrure
  Ne lyf-holy as eremytes
  That wonnede wyle in wodes
  With beres and lyones.
  Some had lyflode of here lynage,
  And of no lyf elles;
  And some lyvede by here lettrure
  And labour of here hondes;
  Some had foreynes to frendes,
  That hem fode sente;
  And bryddes brouhten to some bred,
  Werby thei lyveden.
  Alle thuse holy eremytes
  Were of hye kynne,
  Forsoke londe and lordshep
  And lykynges of the body;
  Ac thuse eremytes, that edefyen
  Thus by the hye weyes,
  Wylen were workmen,
  Webbes and taillours,
  And carters knaves
  And clerkus without grace,
  Heelden hungry hous,
  And had much defaute,

  That faitours in frere clothynge

  For-thi lefte thei here laboure,

  Other on of som ordre,
  Othere elles prophite,
  Ayens the lawe he lyveth,
  Yf Latyn be trywe:
  _Non licet nobis legem voluntate, sed voluntatem
      conjungere legi._

4771. _Perkyn_, the diminutive of Peter, or Piers. Formerly the diminutives
of people's names were constantly used as marks of familiarity or
endearment, as Hawkyn or Halkyn for Henry, Tymkyn for Tim or Timothy,
Dawkyn for David, Tomkyn for Thomas, &c.

4963. _To falle and to stonde._ I by no means agree with Price's
interpretation of this phrase, or in his preference of the reading _to
falle if he stonde_. (Note on Warton ii, 67.) The motion of the boat causes
the firm man alternately to fall and stand; be he ever so stable, he
stumbles now and then, but his strength is shown in his being able to
recover himself. Such are the moral slips which even the just man cannot
avoid. But if the man in the boat be too weak to arise again and place
himself at the helm, his boat and himself will be lost for want of strength
and guidance. So it is with the wicked man. The completion of the phrase
quoted from Proverbs, as given in the preceding note, shows the justice of
this explanation.

5014. _if I may lyve and loke._ Price (in Warton) first pointed out the
identity between this expression and the one so common in Homer: it is "one
of those primitive figures which are common to the poetry of every
country."

  [Greek: Outis, emeu zontos kai epi chthoni derkomenoio,]
  [Greek: Soi koileis para neusi bareias cheiras epoisei.]
                                           Il. i, 88.

Whitaker's interpretation is nonsense, "If I have space to live and look in
the book." Other instances of this phrase occur in ll. 12132, 13268, and
13303 of Piers Ploughman.

5082. 2 Corinth. xi, 19.

5157. _of four kynnes thynges._ The medieval notion of the manner in which
the elements were mixed together in the formation of the human body, here
alluded to, appears to partake more of Western legend than of Eastern
tradition. In the English verses on Popular Science (given in my "Popular
Treatises of Science written during the Middle Ages," p. 138), we have the
following curious account of the four things forming the body, and the
influence of each:--

  Man hath of urthe al his bodi, of water he haveth wete,
  Of eyr he haveth wynd, of fur he haveth hete.
  Ech quic thing of alle this foure, of some hath more other lasse;
  Ho so haveth of urthe most, he is slou as an asse;
  Of vad colour, of hard hide, boustes forme, and ded strong,
  Of moche thoght, of lute speche, of stille grounynge, and wraththe long,
  A slough wrecche and ferblet, fast and loth to geve his god,
  Sone old, and noght wilful, stable and stedefast of mode.

And so on with the other elements. This doctrine of the composition of man
from the four elements became a very popular one in the sixteenth century,
when the poets frequently allude to it, as may be seen in the examples
given by Nares (_v._ ELEMENTS). In the _Mirror for Magistrates_ (_King
Forrex_, page 76), it is said:--

  If we behold the substance of a man,
    How he is made of _elements_ by kind,
  Of earth, of water, aire, and fire, than
    We would full often call unto our mind,
    That all our earthly joys we leave behind.

Massinger (_Renegado_ iii, 2) says:--

                      ----I've heard
  Schoolmen affirm, man's body is compos'd
  Of _the four elements_.

In Shakespeare (_Twel. N._ ii, 3), Sir Toby Belch inquires, "Does not our
life consist of _the four elements_?" and Brutus is commended for
possessing these elements properly blended, in which the perfection of a
man's nature was supposed to consist:--

  His life was gentle; and the _elements_
  So mix'd in him, that Nature might stand up
  And say to all the world, This _was a man_.
                        _Jul. Caes._ v, 5.

On the other hand, the ill mixing of these elements was supposed to be
accompanied with a corresponding derangement of the intellectual faculties.
Thus, in one of the plays of Beaumont and Fletcher, a madman is
addressed:--

  I prithee, thou _four elements_ ill brew'd
  Torment none but thyself: Away, I say,
  Thou beast of passion.
                        _B. and Fl. Nice Valour_, act i, p. 312.

The more mythic form of this legend gives _eight things_ to the formation
of the body, instead of four. Our earliest notice of this legend in England
occurs in the prose Anglo-Saxon Dialogue between Saturn and Solomon
(Thorpe's Analecta, p. 95):--"Saga me thaet andworc the Adam waes
of-ge-worht se aerusta man? Ic the secge of viii punda ge-wihte. Saga me
hwaet hatton thage? Ic the secge thaet aeroste waes foldan pund, of dham
him waes flesc ge-worht; odher waes fyres pund, thanon him waes thaet blod
read and hat; thridde waes windes pund, thanon him waes seo aedhung
ge-seald; feordhe waes wolcnes pund, thanon him waes his modes
unstadhelfaestnes ge-seald; fifte waes gyfe pund, thanon him waes ge-seald
se fat and gedhang; syxste waes blostnena pund, thanon him waes eagena
myssenlicnys ge-seald; seofodhe waes deawes pund, thanon him becom swat;
eahtothe waes sealtes pund, thanon him waeron tha tearas sealte."--_Tell me
the matter of which Adam the first man was made? I tell thee, of eight
pound-weights. Tell me their names? I tell thee, the first was a pound of
earth, of which his flesh was made; the second was a pound of fire, from
which his blood was red and hot; the third was a pound of wind, of which
breath was given him; the fourth was a pound of cloud, whereof was given
him his instability of mood; the fifth was a pound of ..., whereof was
given him fat and sinew; the sixth was a pound of flowers, whereof was
given him diversity of eyes; the seventh was a pound of dew, whereof he had
sweat; the eighth was a pound of salt, whereof he had salt tears._ This
legend was still prevalent in England as late as the fifteenth century,
when we find it among the curious collection of questions (closely
resembling those of Saturn and Solomon just quoted) entitled "Questions
bitwene the Maister of Oxinford and his Scoler" (Reliquiae Antiquae, vol.
i, p. 230),--"_C._ Whereof was Adam made? _M._ Of viij. thingis: the first
of erthe, the second of fire, the iij^{de} of wynde, the iiij^{th} of
clowdys, the v^{th} of aire wherethorough he speketh and thinketh, the
vj^{th} of dewe wherby he sweteth, the vij^{th} of flowres, wherof Adam
hath his ien, the viij^{th} is salte wherof Adam hath salt teres." A
similar account is given in an extract from an old Friesic manuscript
communicated to the Zeitschrift fuer Deutsches Alterthum, by Dr. James
Grimm,--"God scop thene eresta meneska, thet was Adam, fon achta wendem;
that benete fon tha stene, thet flask fon there erthe, thet blod fon tha
wetere, tha herta fon tha winde, thene togta (l. thochta) fon tha wolken,
the(ne) suet fon tha dawe, tha lokkar fon tha gerse, tha agene fon there
sunna, and tha blerem on thene helga om."--_God created the first man, who
was Adam, of eight elements: the bone from the stone, the flesh from the
earth, the blood from the water, the heart from the wind, the thought from
the cloud, the sweat from the dew, the hair from the grass, the eyes from
the sun._

5169. _a proud prikere of Fraunce._ A proud rider of France. Until the
fifteenth century there appears to have been a strong prejudice among the
lower orders against horsemen: their name was connected with oppressors and
foreigners. Horses appear to have been comparatively little used for riding
among the Anglo-Saxons until they were introduced by the Norman favourites
of Edward the Confessor, in whose reign we read that the Anglo-Saxon
soldiers in Herefordshire were defeated by the Welsh owing to their
awkwardness on horseback, having been unadvisedly mounted by their Norman
commander. The Anglo-Norman barons of the three following centuries, with
their numerous household of knights and attendants who plundered and
oppressed the peasantry and middle classes of society, kept alive the
prejudice alluded to, and we trace it in several popular songs. In a song
of the reign of Edward I (Political Songs, p. 240), we find the following
lines:--

  Whil God wes on erthe
    And wondrede wyde,
  Whet wes the resoun
    Why he nolde ryde?
  For he nolde no grom
    To go by ys syde,
  Ne grucchyng of no gedelyng
    To chaule ne to chyde.
  Spedeth ou to spewen,
    Ase me doth to spelle;
  The fend ou afretie
    With fleis ant with felle!
  Herkneth hideward, horsmen,
    A tidyng ich ou telle,
  That ye shulen hongen,
    Ant herbarewen in helle!

church were, I believe, Gregory, Ambrose, Augustine, and Jerome.

5412. _as Caym was on Eve._ See further on l. 5549. According to a very
curious legend, which was popular in the middle ages, Cain was born during
the period of penitence and fasting to which our first parents were
condemned for their breach of obedience.

5415. Psa. vii, 15. Concepit dolorem et peperit iniquitatem.

5417. Whitaker's text inserts before this line--

  Caym, the cursed creature,
  Conceyved was in synne;
  After that Adam and Eve
  Hadden y-synged,
  Withoute repentaunce
  Of here rechelessnesse,
  A rybaud thei engendrede,
  And a gome unryghtful;
  As an hywe that ereth nat
  Auntreth hym to sowe

  And so ben cursed wrettches

  And for a felon be hanged,
  The heritage that the air sholde have

5507. _many a peire, sithen the pestilence._ The continuator of William de
Nangis, who gives a detailed account of the effects of the great pestilence
on the Continent, mentions the hasty marriages which followed it, but he
gives quite a different account of their fruitfulness. "Cessante autem
dicta epidimia, pestilentia, et mortalitate, nupserunt viri qui remanserunt
et mulieres ad invicem, conceperunt uxores residuae per mundum ultra modum,
nulla sterilis efficiebatur, sed praegnantes hinc inde videbantur, et
plures geminos pariebant, et aliquae tres infantes insimul vivos
emittebant." The writer goes on to observe, "Sed proh dolor! ex hujus
renovatione saeculi non est mundus propter hoc in melius commutatus. Nam
homines fuerunt postea magis avari et tenaces, cum multo plura bona quam
antea possiderent; magis etiam cupidi et per lites, brigas, et rixas, atque
per placita, seipsos conturbantes.... Charitas etiam ab illo tempore
refrigescere caepit valde, et iniquitas abundavit cum ignorantiis et
peccatis; nam pauci inveniebantur qui scirent aut vellent in domibus,
villis, et castris informare pueros in grammaticalibus
rudimentis."--_Contin. G. de Nangis, in Dacherii Spicileg._ iii, 110 (_ed._
1723).

5515. _do hem to Dunmowe._ This is, I believe, the earliest allusion at
present known to the custom of the flitch of bacon at Dunmow, which was
evidently, at that time, a matter of general celebrity. In Chaucer, about
half a century later, the Wife of Bath says of her two old husbands, and of
the way in which she tyrannized over them,--

  The bacoun was nought fet for hem, I trowe,
  That som men fecche in Essex at Donmowe.--_Cant. T._ 5799.

In a curious religious poem preserved in a manuscript in the Bodleian
Library at Oxford, written about the year 1460, from which some extracts
are printed in the "Reliquiae Antiquae," ii, 27-29, we have the following
satirical allusion to this custom:--

  I can fynde no man now that wille enquere
  The parfyte wais unto Dunmow;
  For they repent hem within a yere,
  And many within a weke, and sonner, men trow;
  That cawsith the weis to be rowgh and over-grow,
  That no man may fynd path or gap,
  The world is turnyd to another shap.

  Befe and moton wylle serve wele enow;
  And for to seche so ferre a lytill bakon flyk,
  Which hath long hanggid resty and tow
  And the wey, I telle you, is comborous and thyk,
  And thou might stomble, and take the cryk;
  Therfor bide at home, what so ever hap
  Tylle the world be turnyd into another shap.

One or two other allusions to this custom have been found in manuscripts of
the fifteenth century, and in the sixteenth century these allusions become
more numerous.

5563. 1 Corinth. vii, 1.

5613. _Margery perles._ A margarite pearl, _perle marguerite_. The Latin
name for a pearl (_margarita_) seems to be the origin of this expression.

5634. _a love day | to lette with truthe._ Love days (_Dies amoris_) were
days fixed for settling differences by umpire, without having recourse to
law or to violence. The ecclesiastics seem generally to have had the
principal share in the management of these transactions, which throughout
the Visions of Piers Ploughman appear to be censured as the means of
hindering justice and of enriching the clergy. A little further on,
Religion is blamed for being "a ledere of love-dayes." (l. 6219.) In
Chaucer, it is said of the friar:--

  And over'al, ther eny profyt schulde arise,
  Curteys he was, and lowe of servyse.
    .    .    .    .    .    .
  And rage he couthe and pleye as a whelpe,
  In love-dayes, ther couthe he mochil helpe.
  For ther was he not like a cloysterer
  With a thredbare cope, as a pore scoler,
  But he was like a maister or a pope.--_Cant. T._ 249, 259.

5646. The quotation is made up from Job xxi, 7; and Jerem. xii, 2.

In what follows, Whitaker's text is in parts much more brief than the one
now printed; there are also many transpositions, and other variations,
which are not of sufficient importance to be pointed out more particularly.

5801. _in a pryvee parlour._ 5803. _in a chambre with a chymenee._ This is
a curious illustration of contemporary manners. The hall was the apartment
in which originally the lord of the household and the male portion of the
family passed nearly all their time when at home, and where they lived in a
manner in public. The chambers were only used for sleeping, and as places
of retirement for the ladies, and had, at first, no fire-places
(_chymenees_), which were added, in course of time, for their comfort. The
parlour was an apartment introduced also at a comparatively late period,
and was, as its name indicates, a place for private conferences or
conversation. As society advanced in refinement, people sought to live less
and less in public, and the heads of the household gradually deserted the
hall, except on special occasions, and lived more in the parlour and in the
"chambre with a chymenee." With the absence of the lord from the hall, its
festive character and indiscriminate hospitality began to diminish; and the
popular agitators declaimed against this as an unmistakeable sign of the
debasement of the times.

5911. _seven artz._ In the scholastic system of the middle ages, the whole
course of learning was divided into seven arts, which were, grammar,
dialectics, rhetoric, music, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy. They were
included in the following memorial distich:--

this part of the poem. Instead of 6217-6277, we have the following lines:--

_cherl_ or peasant, in the Descriptio Norfolciensium, in my Early Mysteries
and other Latin Poems of the Twelfth and Thirteenth Centuries, p. 94. The
'cherl,' vilein, or bondman, could not even be put apprentice without the
licence of the lord of the soil. In the curious poem on the Constitution of
Masonry (14th cent.) published by Mr. Halliwell, the master is particularly
cautioned on this point:--

  The fowrthe artycul thys moste be,
  That the mayster hym wel be-se
  That he no bondemon prentys make,
  Ny for no covetyse do hym take;
  For the lord that he ys bonde to,

lxxxxvii,--

"In the tyme that Trayan themperour regned, and on a tyme as he wente
toward a batayll out of Rome, it happed that in hys waye as he shold ryde a
woman a wydowe came to hym wepyng and sayd: I praye thee, syre, that thou
avenge the deth of one my sone, whyche innocently and wythout cause hath
ben slayn. Themperour answerd: yf I come agayn fro the batayll hool and
sounde, thenne I shall do justyce for the deth of thy sone. Thenne sayd the
wydowe: Syre, and yf thou deye in the bataylle, who shall thenne avenge hys
deth for me? And the wydowe sayd, is it not better that thou do to me
justice, and have the meryte thereof of God, than another have it for thee?
Then had Trayan pyte, and descended fro his horse, and dyde justyce in
avengynge the deth of her sone. On a tyme saynt Gregory went by the marked
of Rome whyche is called the marked of Trayan. And thenne he remembred of
the justyce and other good dedes of Trayan, and how he had ben pyteous and
debonayr, and was moche sorowfull that he had ben a paynem; and he tourned
to the chyrche of saynt Peter waylyng for thorrour of the mescreaunce of
Trayan. Thenne answerd a voys fro God, sayng: I have now herd thy prayer,
and have spared Trayan fro the payne perpetuelly. By thys thus, as somme
saye, the payne perpetuell due to Trayan as a mescreaunt was somme dele
take awaye, but for all that was he not quyte fro the pryson of helle; for
the sowle may well be in helle, and fele ther no payne, by the mercy of
God."

7113. In Whitaker's text the following passage is here inserted:--

  Thus consaileth Crist
  In comun ous alle,
  'Ho so coveyteth to come
  To my kynriche,
  He mot forsake hymself,
  Hus suster, and hus brother,
  And al that the worlde wolde,
  And my wil folwen.'
  _Nisi renunciaveritis omnia quae possidetis,

  Of meny holy seyntes,

  And by greyn that groweth,

  _Nisi granum frumenti cadens in terra,

  Yut men that of Abraam
  And Job were wonder ryche,
  And out of numbre tho men

  Bynom hym ys housewif

  And for he suffrede and seide nouht,

  And also Job the gentel

  And wise philosophers,
  Bothe two but goode,

  And lyves that our Lorde loveth,
  And large weyes to hevene.
  Ac the povre pacient
  Purgatorye passeth
  Rathere than the ryche,
  Thauh thei renne at ones.
  For yf a marchaunt and a messager
  Metten to-gederes,
  For the parcels of hus paper
  And other pryvey dettes,
  Wol lette hym as ich leyve
  The lengthe of a myle;
  The messager doth namore
  Bote hus mouth telleth,

  And is anon delyvered;
  And thauh thei wende by the wey
  Tho two to-gederes.
  Thauh the messager made hus wey
  Amyde the whete,
  Wole no wys man wroth be,
  Ne hus wed take,
  Ys non haiwarde y-hote
  Hus wed for to take.
  _Necessitas non habet legem._
  Ac yf the marchaunt make hus way
  Overe menne cornne,
  And the haywarde happe
  With hym for to mete,
  Other hus hatt, other hus hed,
  Other elles hus gloves,
  The merchaunt mot for-go,
  Other moneys of huse porse,
  And yut be lett, as ich leyve,
  For the lawe asketh
  Marchauns for here merchandise
  In meny place to tullen.
  Yut thauh thei wenden on wey
  As to Wynchestre fayre,
  The marchaunt with hus marchaundise
  May nat go so swythe
  As the messager may,
  Ne with so mochel ese.
  For that on bereth bote a boxe,
  A brevet therynne,
  Ther the marchaunt ledeth a male
  With meny kynne thynges;
  And dredeth to be ded therefore,
  And he in derke mete
  With robbours and with revers
  That riche men despoilen,
  Ther the messager is ay murye,
  Hus mouthe ful of songes,
  And leyveth for hus letters
  That no wight wol hym greve.
  Ac yut myghte the marchaunt
  Thorgh monye and other yeftes
  Have hors and hardy men,
  Thauh he mette theoves,
  Wolde non suche asailen hym
  For hem that hym folweth,
  As safliche passe as the messager,
  And as sone at hus hostel.
  Ye, wyten wel, ye wyse men,
  What this is to mene.
  The marchaunt is no more to mene
  Bote men that ben ryche
  Aren acountable to Crist
  And to the kyng of hevene,
  That holden mote the heye weye,
  Evene ten hestes,
  Bothe lovye and lene,
  The leele and the unleele,
  And have reuthe, and releve
  With hus grete richesse
  By hus power alle manere men
  In meschief y-falle,
  Fynde beggars bred,
  Backes for the colde,
  Tythen here goodes tryweliche,
  A tol as hit semeth
  That oure Lord loketh after
  Of eche a lyf that wyneth,
  Withoute wyles other wrong,
  Other wommen atte stuwes,
  And yut more, to make pees,
  And quyte menne dettes,
  Bothe spele and spare
  To spene upon the needful,
  As Crist self comandeth
  To alle Cristene puple.
  _Alter alterius onera porta._
  The messager aren the mendinans
  That lyveth by menne almesse,
  Beth nat y-bounde, as beeth the riche,
  To bothe the two lawes,
  To lene and to lere,
  Ne lentenes to faste,
  And other pryvey penaunces
  The wiche the preest wol wel,
  That the law yeveth leve
  Suche lowe folke to be excused,
  As none tythes to tythen,
  Ne clothe the nakede,
  Ne in enquestes to come,
  Ne contumax thauh he worthe
  Halyday other holy eve
  Hus mete to deserve;
  For yf he loveth and byleyveth
  As the lawe techeth,
  _Qui crediderit et baptizatus fuerit, etc._
  Telleth the lord a tale,
  As a triwe messager,
  And sheweth by seel and suthe by lettere
  With wat lord he dwelleth,
  Kneweleche hym crystene
  And of holy churche byleyve,
  Ther is no lawe, as ich leyve,
  Wol let hym the gate,
  Ther God is gatwarde hymself
  And eche a gome knoweth.
  The porter of pure reuthe
  May parforme the lawe
  In that he wilneth and wolde
  Ech wight as hemself;
  For the wil is as muche worth
  Of a wretche beggere
  As al that the ryche may reyme
  And ryght fulliche dele,
  And as much mede
  For a myte that he offreth,
  As the riche man for al is moneye,
  And more, as by the Godspel:
  _Amen dico vobis quia haec vidua paupercula,
      etc._
  So that povre pacient
  Is parfitest lif of alle,
  And alle parfit preestes
  To poverte sholde drawe.

7191. James ii, 10.

7194. _over-skipperis._ Those who skipped over words in reading or chanting
the service of the church. The following distich points out the classes of
defaulters in this respect:--

  Ecclesiae tres sunt qui servitium maie fallunt;
  Momylers, for-scyppers, ovre-lepers, non bene psallunt.
            _Reliq. Antiq._ p. 90. _Poems of Walter Mapes_, p. 148.

A still more numerous list of such offenders is given in the following
lines from MS. Lansdowne, 762, fol. 101, v^o:--

  Hii sunt qui Psalmos corrumpunt nequitur almos:
  Jangler cum jasper, lepar, galper quoque, draggar,
  Momeler, for-skypper, for-reynner, sic et over-leper,
  Fragmina verborum Tutivillus colligit horum.

Tutivillus was the popular name of one of the fiends (see Towneley
Mysteries, pp. 310, 319; Reliq. Antiq. p. 257). According to an old legend,
a hermit walking out met one of the devils bearing a large sack, very full,
under the load of which he seemed to labour. The hermit asked him what he
carried in his sack. He answered that it was filled with the fragments of
words which the clerks had skipped over or mutilated in the performance of
the service, and that he was carrying them to hell to be deposited among
the stores there.

7195. Psal. xlvi, 7, 8.

7264. _Briddes I biheld._ A similar sentiment is expressed in the following
parallel passage of a modern poet:--

  But most of all it wins my admiration
  To view the structure of this little work--
  A bird's nest. Mark it well, within, without,
  No tool had he that wrought, no knife to cut,
  No nail to fix, no bodkin to insert,
  No glue to join; his little beak was all:
  And yet how neatly finished! What nice hand,
  With every implement and means of art,
  And twenty years' apprenticeship to boot,
  Could make me such another? Fondly then
  We boast of excellence, where noblest skill
  Instinctive genius foils.--_Hurdis._

7342. Ecclesiasticus xi, 9.

7344. Instead of ll. 7344-7363, Whitaker's text has the following
passage:--

  'Ho suffreth more than God?' quath he,
  'No gome, as ich leyve.
  He myght amende in a mynt while
  Al that amys stondes.
  Ac he suffreth, in ensaumple
  That we sholde all suffren.
  Ys no vertue so feyr
  Of value ne of profit,
  As ys suffraunce, soveraynliche,
  So hit be for Godes love,
  And so wittnesseth the wyse,
  And wysseth the Frenshe,
  _Bele vertue est suffraunce,
      Mal dire est petite venjaunce;
      Bien dire e bien suffrer
      Fait ly suffrable a bien vener._
  For-thi.' quath Reson, 'Ich rede the,
  Rewele thi tonge evere;
  And er thow lacke eny lyf,
  Loke ho is to preise.
  For is no creature under Cryst,
  That can hymselve make;
  And yf cristene creatures
  Couthen make hemselve,
  Eche lede wolde be lacles,
  Leyf thow non othere.
  Man was mad of suche matere,
  He may nat wel asterte,
  That som tymes hym tit
  To folwen hus kynde.
  Caton acordeth herwith:
  _Nemo sine crimine vivit._

7347. Genes. i, 31.

7363. Cato, Distich. i, 5.

  Si vitam inspicias hominum, si denique mores,
  Quum culpent alios, nemo sine crimine vivit.

It may be observed here, that Whitaker, in his note on this passage, has
very much misunderstood Tyrwhitt (in Chaucer, Cant. T. 3227), in making him
the authority for calling the author of the _Disticha de Moribus_ an
obscure French writer. Tyrwhitt says that the mode in which Chaucer spells
his name (Caton) seems to show that the French translation was more read
than the Latin original. The same observation would apply to the present
poem: but I am very doubtful how far it is correct. The Distiches of Cato
were translated into English, French, German, &c., and were extremely
popular. The author of these Distiches, Dionysius Cato, is supposed to have
lived under the Antonines, and has certainly no claim to the title of _an
obscure French writer_.

7441-7642. Instead of these lines, Whitaker has the following:--

  And wissede the ful ofte
  What Dowel was to mene,
  And counsailede the, for Cristes sake,
  No creature to bygyle,
  Nother to lye nor to lacke,
  Ne lere that is defendid,
  Ne to spille speche,
  As to speke an ydel;
  And no tyme to tene,
  Ne trywe thyng to teenen;
  Lowe the to lyve forth
  In the lawe of holy churche,
  Thenne dost thow wel, withoute drede,
  Ho can do bet no forse.
  Clerkes that connen al, ich hope,
  Thei con do bettere;
  Ac hit suffuseth to be saved,
  And to be suche as ich tauhte:
  Ac for to lovye and lene,
  And lyve wel and byleyve,
  Ys y-calid _Caritas_,
  Kynde-love in English,
  And that is Dobet, yf eny suche be,
  A blessed man that helpeth,
  And pees be and pacience,
  And povre withoute defaute.
  _Beatius est dare quam petere._
  As catel and kynde witt
  Encombre ful menye,
  Woo is hym that hem weldeth,
  Bote he hym wel dispeyne.
  _Scientes et non facientes variis flagellis
      vapulabunt._
  Ac comunliche connynge
  And unkynde rychesse,
  As lorels to be lordes,
  And lewede men techeres,
  And holy churche horen help,
  Averous and coveytous,
  Droweth up Dowel,
  And destruyeth Dobest.
  Ac grace is a gras therfore
  To don hem eft growe;
  Ac grace groweth nat,
  Til God wil gynne reyne,
  And wokie thorwe goode werkes
  Wikkede hertes;
  Ac er suche a wil wol wexe,
  God hymself worcheth,
  And send forth seint espirit
  To don love sprynge.
  _Spiritus ubi vult spirat, etc._
  So grace withoute grace
  Of God and of good werkes,
  May nat bee, bee thow siker,
  Thauh we bid evere.
  Cleregie cometh bote of siht,
  And kynd witt of sterres,
  As to be bore other bygete
  In suche constellacion
  That wit wexeth therof,
  And othere wordes bothe.
  _Vultus hujus saeculi sunt subjecti vultibus
      coelestibus._
  So grace is a gyfte of God,
  And kynde witt a chaunce,
  And cleregie and connyng of kynde
  Wittes techynge;
  And yut is cleregie to comende
  Fore Cristes love more,
  Than eny connynge of kynde witt,
  Bote cleregie hit rewele.
  For Moyses wutnesseth that God wrot
  In stoon with hus fynger,
  Lawe of love owre Lorde wrot,
  Long ere Crist were;
  And Crist cam and confermede,
  And holy-churche made,
  And in sond a sygne wrot,
  And seide to the Jewes,
  'That seeth hym synneles,
  Cesse nat, ich hote,
  To stryke with stoon other with staf
  This strompett to dethe.'
  _Qui vestrum sine peccato est, etc._
  For-thi ich consaily alle Cristene

7470. _makynges._ 7483. _make._--There is a curious analogy between the
Greek and the Teutonic languages in the name given to the poet--the Greek
[Greek: poietes] (from [Greek: poiein]), the Anglo-Saxon _scop_ (from
_sceopan_, to make or create), and the Middle-English _maker_, preserved in
the later Scottish _makkar_ (also applied to a poet), have all the same
signification. In the Neo-Latin tongues a different, though somewhat
analogous, word was used: the French and Anglo-Norman _trouvere_, and the
Provencal _trobador_, signify a finder or inventor.

7528, &c. _Aristotle_, _Ypocras_, and _Virgile_.--These three names were
the great representatives of ancient science and literature in the middle
ages. Aristotle represented philosophy, in its most general sense; Virgil
represented literature in general, and more particularly the ancient
writers who formed the _grammar_ course of scholastic learning, whether
verse or prose; Ypocras, or Hippocrates, represented medicine. They are
here introduced to illustrate the fact that men of science and learning, as
well as warriors and rich men, experience the vicissitudes of fortune.

7534. _Felice._ Perhaps this name is only introduced for the sake of
alliteration.

7536. _Rosamounde._ I suppose the reference is to "fair Rosamond."

7554. Luc. vi, 38.

7567. John iii, 8.

7572. John iii, 11.

7582. John iii, 8.

7600. _thorugh caractes._ It was the popular belief in the middle ages,
that while the Jews were accusing the woman taken in adultery, Christ wrote
with his staff on the ground the sins of the accusers, and that when they
perceived this they dropped their accusation in confusion at finding that
their own guilt was known. See this point curiously illustrated in Mr.
Halliwell's Coventry Mysteries, pp. 220, 221. These are the _characters_
alluded to in Piers Ploughman.

7624. Luke vi, 37.

7701. 1 Cor. iii, 19.

7709. Luke ii, 15.

7714. Matth. ii, 1.

7721. Luke ii, 7.

7779. Psalm xxxi, 1.

7795. Luke vi, 39. The ignorance and inefficiency of the parish priests
appear to have become proverbial in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.
In the latter century a canon of Lilleshul in Shropshire, named John Myrk,
or Myrkes, composed an English poem, or rather metrical treatise, on their
duties, which he commences by applying to them this same aphorism of our
Saviour:--

  God seyth hymself, as wryten we fynde,
  That whenne the blynde ledeth the blynde,
  Into the dyche they fallen boo,
  For they ne sen whare by to go.
  So faren prestes now by dawe,
  They beth blynde in Goddes lawe, etc.
                                   _MS. Cotton. Claud._ A. II.

It had previously been applied in the same manner to the parish priests by
the author of a long French poem (apparently written in England in the
fourteenth century) entitled _Le Miroir de l'Ome_ (Speculum Hominis), as
follows:--

  Dieus dist, et c'est tout verite,
  Qe si l'un voegle soit mene
  D'un autre voegle, tresbucher
  Falt ambedeux en la fossee.
  C'est un essample compare
  As fols curetz, qui sanz curer
  Ne voient pas le droit sentier,
  Dont font les autres forsvoier,
  Qui sont apres leur trace ale.
  Car fol errant ne puet quider,
  Ne cil comment nous puet saner,
  Qui mesmes est au mort naufre.
      _MS. in the possession of Mr. J. Russell Smith._

The following picture of the corrupt manners of the parish priests at this
time is extracted from a much longer and more minute censure in the same
poem:--

  Des fols curetz auci y a,
  Qui sur sa cure demourra
  Non pour curer, mais q'il sa vie
  Endroit le corps plus easera.
  Car lors ou il bargaignera
  Du seculiere marchandie,
  Dont sa richesce multeplie;
  Ou il se donne a leccherie,
  Du quoy son corps delitera;
  Ou il se prent a venerie,
  Qant duist chanter sa letanie,
  Au bois le goupil huera.

7802. Psal. xv, 5. We might be led to suppose that this was the "neck
verse" in the time of Piers Ploughman. In later times the text which was
given to read to those who claimed the benefit of clergy is said to have
been the beginning of Psal. lv, _Miserere mei, &c._

7840. Eccl. v, 5.

7846. _Trojanus._ See the note on line 6859.

7854. Matth. xvi, 27. Filius enim hominis venturus est in gloria Patris sui
cum angelis suis: et tunc reddet unicuique secundum opera ejus.

7915. _his flessh is foul flessh._ Yet in spite of the "foulness" of its
flesh, the peacock was a very celebrated dish at table. For an account of
the use made of the peacock in feasts, see Le Grand d'Aussy, Histoire de la
Vie privee des Francais, tom. i, pp. 299-301, and 361. In the Romance of
Mahomet, 13th century, it is said of Dives--

  Et dou Riche qui _tant poon
  Englouti_ et tant bon poisson,
  Tante pieche de venison,
  Et but bon vin par grant delit, &c.
                     _Roman de Mahommet_, l. 301.

7944. _Avynet._ In the 14th and 15th centuries, as any grammar was called a
_Donet_, because the treatise of Donatus was the main foundation of them
all, so, from Esop and Avienus from whom the materials were taken, any
collection of fables was called an _Avionet_ or an _Esopet_. The title of
one of these collections in a MS. of the Bibl. du Roi at Paris is,
_Compilacio Ysopi alata cum Avionetto, cum quibusdam addicionibus et
moralitatibus_. (_Robert, Fabl. Ined. Essay_, p. clxv.) Perhaps the
reference in the present case is to the fable of the Peacock who complained
of his voice, the 39th in the collection which M. Robert calls _Ysopet_, in
the morality to which are the following lines:--

  Les riches conteront
  Des biens qu'il aront
  En ce siecle conquis.
  Cil qui petit ara,
  De petit contera
  Au Roy de paradis.
  Qui vit en povrete,
  Sans point d'iniquite,
  Moult ara grant richesse
  Es cieux, en paradis,
  O dieux et ses amis
  Seront joyeux et aise.

7961. Whitaker's text reads here:--

  Thus Porfirie and Plato,
  And poetes menye,
  Lykneth in here logyk
  The leeste fowel oute;
  And whether hii be saf other nat saf
  The sothe wot not clergie,
  Ne of Sortes ne of Salamon
  No scripture can telle,
  Wether thei be in helle other in hevene,
  Other Aristotle the wise.

7961. _Aristotle, the grete clerk._ From the eleventh to the sixteenth
centuries the influence of Aristotle's writings in the schools was
all-powerful. It was considered almost an impiety to go against his
authority. He was indeed "the great clerk."

7967. _Sortes._ I suppose this is an abbreviated form of the name Socrates.
It occurs again in one of the poems printed among the Latin Poetry
attributed to Walter Mapes (Camden Society's Publication), which has the
following lines:--

  Adest ei bajulus cui nomen Gnato,
  Praecedebat logicum gressu fatigato,
  Dorso ferens sarcinam ventre tensus lato,
  Plenam vestro dogmate, o _Sortes et Plato_.

7987. 1 Peter iv, 18.

8015. Psalm xxii, 4.

8073. _a maister._ This word was generally used in the scholastic ages in a
restricted sense, to signify one who had taken his degrees in the
schools--a master of arts.

8103. Luke x, 7.

8133-8137. These are the indications of different Psalms. Psalm li begins
with the words, _Miserere mei, Deus_, secundum magnam misericordiam tuam.
The thirty-first Psalm commences with the words, _Beati quorum_ remissae
sunt iniquitates, _et quorum tecta sunt peccata_. _Beatus vir_, is the
beginning of Psalm i. The fifth verse of Psalm xxxi contains the words
_Dixi: Confitebor_ adversum me injustitiam meam Domino.

8141. Psalm xxxi, 6.

8145. Psalm l, 19.

8153. Isaiah v, 22.

8155. Whitaker's text has--

  And ete meny sondry metes,
  Mortrews and poddynges,
  Braun and blod of the goos,
  Bacon and colhopes.

The second Trin. Coll. MS. has--

  And sette many sundry metis,
  Mortreux and puddynges,
  Braun and blood of gees,
  Bacoun and colopis.

8167. 2 Corinth. xi, 24, 25, 27.

8173, 8180. 2 Cor. xi, 26.

8202. _Mahoun._ Mahoun was the middle-age name of Mohammed, and in the
popular writers was often taken in the mere sense of an idol or pagan
deity.

8204. _justly wombe._ MS. Trin. Coll. 2.

8225. _in a frayel._ Whitaker's text has _in a forel_, which he explains by
"a wicker basket." The second Trin. Coll. MS. has also _in a forell_.
_Forel_ is the Low-Latin _forellus_, a bag, sack, or purse: a _frayel_
(_fraellum_) was a little wicker basket, such as were used for carrying
figs or grapes.

8273. Matth. v, 19.

8292. Psalm xiv, 1.

8368. 1 John iv, 18.

8416. Luke xix, 8.

8418. Luke xxi, 1-4.

8444. _Surre._ Syria.

8474. _a mynstrall._ The description of the minstrel given here is very
curious. For a sketch of the character of this profession see Mr. Shaw's
"Dresses and Decorations of the Middle Ages;" and for more enlarged details
of the history of the craft the reader may consult the Introduction to
Percy's Reliques, and Chappell's History of National Airs.

8518. _a pardon with a peis of leed._ The papal bulls, &c., had seals of
lead, instead of wax.

8526. Marc. xvi, 17, 18.

8541. Acts iii, 6.

8554. Whitaker's text omits all that follows here to l. 8958 of our text,
entering very abruptly upon the subject there treated. Some of the
intervening matter had already been inserted in other places in Whitaker's
text. See our notes on ll. 2846 and 3030.

8567. _cart ... with breed fro Stratforde._ Stratford-at-Bow is said to
have been famous in old times for its numerous bakers, who supplied a great
part of the metropolis. Stowe, in his Survey of London, p. 159 (who appears
to have altered the text of Piers Ploughman to suit his own calculation,
for all the manuscripts and printed editions I have collated give "twice
_twenty_ and ten"), observes, "And because I have here before spoken of the
bread carts comming from Stratford at the Bow, ye shall understand that of
olde time the bakers of breade at Stratford were allowed to bring dayly
(except the Sabbaoth and principall feast) diverse long cartes laden with
bread, the same being two ounces in the pennie wheate loafe heavier than
the penny wheate loafe baked in the citie, the same to be solde in Cheape,
three or foure carts standing there, betweene Gutherans lane and Fausters
lane ende, one cart on Cornehill, by the conduit, and one other in Grasse
streete. And I have reade that in the fourth yere of Edward the second,
Richard Reffeham being maior, a baker named John of Stratforde, for making
bread lesser than the assise, was with a fooles whoode on his head, and
loaves of bread about his necke, drawne on a hurdle through the streets of
this citie. Moreover in the 44. of Edward the third, John Chichester being
maior of London, I read in the visions of Pierce Plowman, a booke so
called, as followeth. _There was a careful commune when no cart came to
towne with baked bread from Stratford: tho gan beggers weepe, and workemen
were agast, a little this will be thought long in the date of our Dirte, in
a drie Averell a thousand and three hundred, twise thirtie and ten, &c._ I
reade also in the 20. of Henrie the eight, Sir James Spencer being maior,
six bakers of Stratford were merced in the Guildhall of London, for baking
under the size appoynted. These bakers of Stratford left serving of this
citie, I know not uppon what occasion, about 30 yeares since."

8572. _a drye Aprill._ This is without doubt the dry season placed by
Fabyan in the year 1351, which, as he describes it, began with the month of
April. The difference of the date arises probably from a different system
of computation. Fabian says, "In the sommer of this xxvii yeare, it was so
drie that it was many yeres after called the drie sommer. For from the
latter ende of March, till the latter ende of Julye, fell lytle rayne or
none, by reason whereof manye inconveniences ensued."

8576. _Whan Chichestre was maire._ According to Fabyan, John Chichester was
mayor only once, in 1368, 1369, which was the period of the "thirde
mortalytie." The other authorities seem to agree in giving this as the year
of Chichester's mayoralty. He may perhaps have been mayor more than once.
See INTRODUCTION.

8645. Galat. i, 10.

8685. Psalm x, 7.

8707, 8708. The two persons mentioned here (the shoemaker of Southwark and
dame Emma of Shoreditch) were probably eminent sorcerers and
fortune-tellers of the time.

8769-8778. To understand fully this passage, it must be borne in mind that
the corn lands were not so universally hedged as at present, and that the
portions belonging to different persons were separated only by a narrow
furrow, as is still the case in some of the uninclosed lands in
Cambridgeshire.

8812. _Brugges._ Bruges was the great mart of continental commerce during
the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries.

8813. _Pruce-lond_--Prussia, which was then the farthest country in the
interior of Europe with which a regular trade was carried on by the English
merchants.

8827. Matth. vi, 21.

8858. Luke vi, 25.

8879. Psalm ci, 7.

8891. _a lady of sorwe._ The old printed edition has a _laye of sorow_.

8900. Whitaker has no division here, but continues the previous _passus_,
and omits many lines and has many variations in what follows.

8903. _I slepe therinne o nyghtes._ This passage is curious, because at the
time the poem was written, it was the custom for all classes of society to
go to bed quite naked, a practice which is said to have been not entirely
laid aside in the sixteenth century. We see constant proofs of this
practice in the illuminations of old manuscripts. The following memorial
lines are written in the margin of a MS. of the thirteenth century:--

  Ne be thi winpil nevere so jelu ne so stroutende,
  Ne thi faire tail so long ne so trailende,
  That tu ne schalt at evin al kuttid bilevin,
  And tou schalt to bedde gon so nakid as tou were [borin].
                              _MS. Cotton. Cleop. C._ VI, fol. 22, r^o.

In the Roman de la Violette, the old nurse expresses her astonishment that
her young mistress should retain her chemise when she goes to bed:--

  Et quant elle son lit fait a,
  Sa dame apiele, si se couche
  Nue en chemise en la couche;
  C'onques en trestoute sa vie
  La biele, blonde, l'escavie,
  Ne volt demostrer sa char nue.
  La vielle en est au lit venue,
  Puis li a dit: 'Dame, j'esgart
  Une chose, se Dex me gart,
  Dont je sui molt esmervillie
  C'onques ne vous vi despoillie,
  Et si vous ai vij. ans gardee;
  Molt vous ai souvent esgardee
  Que vo chemise ne sachies!'
                    _Rom. de la Viol._ l. 577.

The lady explains her conduct by stating that she has a mark on the breast
which she had promised that no one should ever see.

8906. Luke xiv, 20.

8950. _noon heraud ne harpour._ Robes and other garments were among the
most usual gifts bestowed upon minstrels and heralds by the princes and
great barons. See before, ll. 8480, 8481.

8970. Matth. vi, 25, 26.

8999. John xiv, 13; xv, 16. Matth. iv, 4.

9037. Psalm cxliv, 16.

9039. _fourty wynter._ During the forty years that the children of Israel
wandered in the wilderness, they did not apply themselves to agriculture.

9049. _Sevene slepe._ The legend of the seven sleepers was remarkably
popular during the middle ages.

9101. Psalm xxxi. 1.

9176. Psalm lxxv, 6.

9178. Psalm lxxii, 20. Whitaker's _Passus sextus de Dowel_ ends with this
quotation.

9317. Both in the Vision of Piers Ploughman, and in the Creed, there are
frequent expressions of indignation at the extravagant expenditure in
painting the windows of the abbeys and churches. It must not be forgotten
that a little later the same feeling as that exhibited in these satires led
to the destruction of many of the noblest monuments of medieval art.

9344. Mat. xix, 23, 24.

9347. Apocal. xiv, 13.

9352. Matth. v, 3.

9452. Compare the defence of poverty in Chaucer (Cant. T. 6774):--

  Juvenal saith of poverte merily:
  The poore man, whan he goth by the way,
  Beforn the theves he may sing and play.
  _Poverte is hateful good_; and, as I gesse,
  A ful gret _bringer out of besinesse_;
  A _gret amender_ eke _of sapience_,
  To him that taketh it in patience.
  Poverte is this although it seme elenge,
  _Possession that no wight wol challenge._
  Poverte ful often, whan a man is low,
  Maketh his God and eke himself to know:
  Poverte a spectakel is, as thinketh me,
  Thurgh which he may his veray frendes see.
  And therfore, sire, sin that I you not greve,
  Of my poverte no more me repreve.

The definition given in Piers Ploughman is taken from the Dialogues of
Secundus, where it is thus expressed:--"Quid est paupertas? Odibile bonum,
sanitatis mater, curarum remotio, absque sollicitudine semita, sapientiae
reparatrix, negotium sine damno, intractabilis substantia, possessio absque
calumnia, incerta fortuna, sine sollicitudine felicitas." (MS. Reg. 9 A
xiv, fol. 140 v^o.) See also Roger de Hoveden, p. 816, and Vincent de
Beauvais, Spec. Hist. lib. x, c. 71.

9517. _the paas of Aultone._ Whitaker has _Haultoun_, and says that this
pass is Halton "in Cheshire, formerly infamous to a proverb as a haunt of
robbers."

9529. _Cantabit, etc._ The author has modified, or the scribes have
corrupted, the well-known line of Juvenal,

  Cantabit vacuus coram latrone viator.

9665. These definitions will be found in Isidore, Etymol. lib. xl, c. 1,
and Different, lib. ii, c. 29. They are repeated by Alcuin, De Anim. Rat.
N. x, p. 149, _Anima_ est, dum vivificat; dum contemplatur, _spiritus_ est;
dum sentit, _sensus_ est; dum sapit, _animus_ est; dum intelligit, _mens_
est; dum discernit, _ratio_ est; dum consentit, _voluntas_ est; dum
recordatur, _memoria_ est.

9708. Prov. xxv, 27.

9740. Epist. ad Rom. xii, 3.

9751. _the seven synnes._ The seven deadly sins were--pride, anger, envy,
sloth, covetousness, gluttony, and lechery. "Now ben they cleped
chiefetaines, for as moche as they be chiefe, and of hem springen alle
other sinnes. The rote of thise sinnes than is pride, the general rote of
alle harmes. For of this rote springen certain braunches: as, ire, envie,
accidie or slouthe, avarice or coveitise, (to commun understonding)
glotonie, and lecherie: and eche of thise chief sinnes hath his braunches
and his twigges." Chaucer, Persones Tale, p. 40.

9766. Psal. xcvi, 7; iv, 3.

9828. _in Latyn._ The monks had collections of comparisons, similitudes,
proverbs, &c., to be introduced in their sermons, and even when preaching
in English they generally quoted them in Latin. This I suppose to be the
meaning of the expression here.

9918. Matth. xviii, 3.

9934. 1 Corinth. xiii, 4.

9946. 1 Corinth, xiii, 12.

9957. _a tunicle of Tarse._ Tarse was the name given to a kind of silk,
said to have been brought from a country of that name on the borders of
Cathai, or China. Chaucer (Cant. T. l. 2162), describing "the king of
Inde," says--

  His coote armour was of a cloth of Tars,
  Cowched of perlys whyte, round and grete.

Ducange (v. _Tarsicus_) quotes a visitation of the treasury of St. Paul's,
London, in 1295, where there is mention of Tunica et dalmatica de _panno
Indico Tarsico_ Besantato de auro, and of a Casula de _panno Tarsico_.

10004. Psal. vi, 7.

10009. Psal. l, 19.

10062. Matth. vi, 16.

10069. _Edmond and Edward._ St. Edmund the martyr, king of East Anglia, and
king Edward the Confessor.

10124. Psal. iv, 9.

10159. _Antony and Egidie._ Whitaker has _Antonie and Ersenie_. St. Antony
is well known as the father and patron of monks, and for the persecutions
he underwent from the devil. St. Giles, or Egidius, is said to have been a
Greek, who came to France about the end of the seventh century, and
established himself in a hermitage near the mouth of the Rhone, and
afterwards in the neighbourhood of Nismes. Arsenius was a noble Roman who,
at the end of the fourth century, retired to Egypt to live the life of an
anchoret in the desert.

10174. _after an hynde cride._ The monkish biographer of St. Giles relates,
that he was for some time nourished with the milk of a hind in the forest,
and that a certain prince discovered his retreat while hunting in his
woods, by pursuing the hind till it took shelter in St. Giles's hermitage.

10183. _Hadde a bird._ This incident is not found in the common lives of
St. Antony.

10187. _Poul._ Paul was a Grecian hermit, who lived in the tenth century in
the wilderness of Mount Latrus, and became the founder of one of the
monastic establishments there. He was famous for the rigorous severity of
his life.

10203. _Marie Maudeleyne._ By Mary Magdalen here is meant probably St. Mary
the Egyptian, who lived in the fifth century, and who, according to the
legend, after having spent her youth in unbridled debauchery, repented in
her twenty-ninth year, and lived during the remainder of her life
(forty-seven years) in the wilderness beyond the Jordan, without seeing one
human being during that time, and sustained only by the precarious food
which she found in the desert.

10239. Whitaker's text here adds a passage relating to Tobias:--

  Marie Magdalene
  By mores levede and dewes;
  Love and leel byleyve
  Heeld lyf and soule togedere.
    Maria Egyptiaca
  Eet in thyrty wynter
  Bote thre lytel loves,
  And love was her souel.
  Ich can nat rekene hem ryght now,
  Ne reherce here names,
  That lyveden thus for oure Lordes love
  Meny longe yeres,
  Whitoute borwyng other beggyng,
  Other the boke lyeth;
  And woneden in wildernesse
  Among wilde bestes;
  Ac dorst no beste byten hem
  By daye ne by nyghte,
  Bote myldeliche whan thei metten
  Maden louh chere,
  And feyre byfore tho men
  Fauhnede whith the tayles.
  Ac bestes brouhte hem no mete,
  Bote onliche the fouweles;
  In tokenynge that trywe man
  Alle tymes sholde
  Fynde honeste men in holy men
  And other ryghtful peuple.
  For wolde never feithful goud
  That freres and monkes token
  Lyflode of luther wynnynges
  In al here lyf tyme;
  As wytnesseth holy writt
  Whot Thobie deyde
  To is wif, whan he was blynde,
  Herde a lambe blete,--
  'A! wyf, be war,' quath he,
  'What ye have here ynne.
  Lord leyve,' quath the lede,
  'No stole thyng be here!'
  _Videte ne furtum sit. Et alibi, Melius
      est mori quam male vivere._
  This is no more to mene,
  Bote men of holy churche
  Sholde receyve ryght nauth
  Bot that ryght wolde,
  And refuse reverences
  And raveneres offrynges;
  Thenne wolde lordes and ladies
  Be loth to agulte,
  And to take of here tenaunts
  More than treuthe wolde;
  And marchauns merciable wolde be,
  And men of lawe bothe.
  Wold religeouse refuse
  Raveneres almesse,
  Then Grace sholde growe yut
  And grene-leved wexe,
  And Charite, that child is now,
  Sholde chaufen of hem self,
  And comfortye all crystene,
  Wold holy churche amende.
  Job the parfit patriarch
  This proverbe wrot and tauhte,
  To makye a man lovye mesure,
  That monkes beeth and freeres.
  _Nunquam dicit Job, rugiet onager, etc._

Throughout this part of the poem, Whitaker's text differs very much in
words and phraseology from the one now printed, but it would take up too
much space to point out all these variations.

10247. Job vi, 5.

10270. 2 Corinth, ix, 9.

10303. These sentences appear to be quotations from the fathers of the
Latin Church.

10322. _lussheburwes._ A foreign coin, much adulterated, common in England
in the middle of the fourteenth century. Chaucer (C. T. 15445) uses the
word in a very expressive passage:--

  This maketh that oure wyfes wol assaye
  Religious folk, for thay may bettre paye
  Of Venus payementes than may we:
  God woot! no _lusscheburghes_ paye ye.

Among the foreign money, mostly of a base quality, which came into this
country in the fourteenth century, the coinage of the counts of Luxemburg,
or, as it was then called, Lusenburg (hence called _lussheburwes_ and
_lusscheburghes_), seems to have been the most abundant, and to have given
most trouble. These coins were the subject of legislation in 1346, 1347,
1348, and 1351; so that the grievance must have been at its greatest height
at the period to which the poem of Piers Ploughman especially belongs. Many
of these coins are preserved, and found in the cabinets of collectors; they
are in general very much like the contemporary English coinage, and might
easily be taken for it, but the metal is very base.

10368. _Grammer, the ground of al._ In the scholastic learning of the
middle ages, grammar was considered as the first of the seven sciences, and
the foundation-stone of all the rest. See my Essay on Anglo-Saxon
Literature, introductory to vol. i. of the _Biographia Britannica
Literaria_, p. 72. The importance of grammar is thus stated in the _Image
du Monde_ of Gautier de Metz (thirteenth century):--

  Li primeraine des vij. ars,
  Dont or n'est pas seus li quars,
  A ichest tans, chou est gramaire,
  Sans laquele nus ne vaut gaire
  Qui a clergie veut aprendre:
  Car petit puet sans li entendre.
  Gramaires si est fondemens
  De clergie et coumenchemens;
  Cou est li porte de science,
  Par cui on vient a sapience.
  De lettres en gramaire escole
  Qui ensegne et forme parole,
  Soit en Latin ou en Roumans,
  Ou en tous langages palans;
  Qui bien saroit toute gramaire,
  Toute parole saroit faire.
  Par parole fist Dius le monde,
  Et sentence est parole monde.

10398. _Corpus Christi feeste._ Corpus Christi day was a high festival of
the Church of Rome, held annually on the Thursday after Trinity Sunday, in
memory, as was said, of the miraculous confirmation of transubstantiation
under pope Urban IV.

10418. _This Makometh._ This account of Mohammed was the one most popularly
current in the middle ages. According to Hildebert, who wrote a life of the
pseudo-prophet in Latin verse in the twelfth century, Mohammed was a
Christian, skilled in magical arts, who, on the death of the patriarch of
Jerusalem, aspired to succeed him:--

  Nam male devotus quidam baptismate lotus,
      Plenus perfidia vixit in ecclesia.
    .    .    .    .    .    .
  Nam cum transisset Pater illius urbis, et isset
      In coelum subito corpore disposito,
  Tunc exaltari magus hic et pontificari
      Affectans avide; se tamen haec pavide
  Dixit facturum, nisi sciret non nociturum
      Si praesul fiat, cum Deus hoc cupiat.

His intrigues being discovered, the emperor drives him away, and in revenge
he goes and founds a new sect. The story of the pigeon (which is not in
Hildebert) is found in Vincent of Beauvais, Spec. Hist. lib. xxiii, c. 40.
This story is said to be founded in truth. Neither of them are found in the
Roman de Mahomet (by Alexander du Pont), written in the thirteenth century,
and edited by MM. Reinaud and Michel, Paris, 1831, 8vo, a work which
contains much information concerning the Christian notions relative to
Mohammed in the middle ages.

10478. John xvi, 24.

10481, 10486. Matth. v, 13.

10499. _Ellevene holy men._ The eleven apostles who remained after the
apostasy of Judas and the crucifixion of their Lord.

10550. _Ne fesauntz y-bake._ The pheasant was formerly held in the same
honour as the peacock (see before the note on l. 7915), and was served at
table in the same manner. It was considered one of the most precious
dishes. See Le Grand d'Aussy, Hist. de la Vie privee des Francois, ii, 19.
The Miroir de l'Ome (MS. in the possession of Mr. Russell Smith) says
(punning) of the luxurious prelates of the fourteenth century,--

  Pour le phesant et le bon vin
  Le bien-faisant et le divin
  L'evesque laist a nonchalure;
  Si quiert la coupe et crusequin,
  Ainz que la culpe du cristin
  Pour corriger et mettre en cure.

10553. Matth. xxii, 4.

10581. Mark xvi, 15.

10585. _So manye prelates._ 10699. _that huppe aboute in Engelond._ The
pope appointed many titular bishops of foreign sees in which, from the
nature of circumstances, they could not possibly reside, and who therefore
were a burthen upon the church. Some of these prelates appear to have
resorted to England, and to have exercised the episcopal functions,
consecrating churches, &c. The church of Elsfield, in Oxfordshire, was
consecrated by a foreign bishop. (See Kennett's Parochial Antiquities.)

10593. John x, 11.

10599. Matth. xx, 4, 7.

10606. Matth. vii, 7.

10617. Galat. vi, 14.

10632. _That roode thei honoure._ A cross was the common mark on the
reverse of our English money at this period, and for a long time previous
to it. The point of satirical wit in this passage of Piers Ploughman
appears to be taken from the old Latin rhymes of the beginning of the
thirteenth century. See the curious poem _De Cruce Denarii_, in Walter
Mapes, p. 223. Another poem in the same volume (p. 38) speaks thus of the
court of Rome:--

  Nummis in hac curia non est qui non vacet;
  _Crux_ placet, rotunditas, et albedo placet.

10637. _Shul torne as templers dide._ The suppression of the order of the
Templars was at this time fresh in people's memories. It was the general
belief, and not without some foundation, that the Templars had entirely
degenerated from their original sanctity and faithfulness, and that before
the dissolution of the order they were addicted to degrading vices and
superstitions; and they were accused of sacrificing everything else to
their grasping covetousness.

10659. _Whan Constantyn._ The Christian church began first to be endowed
with wealth and power under the emperor Constantine the Great.

10649. Luke i, 52.

10695-10699. Instead of these lines, Whitaker's text has the following:--

  And bereth name of Neptalym,
  Of Nynyve and Damaske.
  For when the holy kynge of hevene
  Sende hus sone to eerthe,
  Meny myracles he wroughte,
  Man for to turne,
  In ensample that men sholde
  See by sad reyson
  That men myghte nat be savede
  Bote thorw mercy and grace,
  And thorw penaunce and passioun,
  And parfyght byleyve;
  And bycam a man of a mayde,
  And _metropolitanus_
  And baptisede an busshoppede
  Whit the blode of hus herte,
  Alle that wilnede other wolde
  Whit inwhight byleyve hit.

  For to enferme the faithe

  And alle holy churche

  And a bryghthe myrour,
  And sovereynliche to alle suche
  That of Surrye bereth name,
  And nat in Engelounde to huppe aboute,
  And halewen men auters.

In the remainder of this passus, Whitaker's text differs much from the one
I have printed, but in such a manner that to give here the variations it
would be necessary to reprint the whole. In the remainder of the poem, the
variations are not great or important, being only such as we always find in
different copies of poems which enjoyed considerable popularity.

anima tua, et ex omni mente tua, et proximum tuum sicut teipsum.

10755. John xi, 43.

10787. _litlum and litlum_, by little and little, gradually. It is the pure
Anglo-Saxon phrase. In the Anglo-Saxon version of Genesis xl, 10, the Latin
_paulatim_ is rendered by _lytlum and lytlum_.

11518, 11520. _lo! here silver ... two pens._ It must be remembered that at
this period the mass of the coinage, including pence, halfpence, and
farthings, was of silver; copper came into use for the smaller coinage at a
later period. Two pence of Edward III would be worth about two shillings of
our modern money.

11670. John xii, 32.

11708. _tu fabricator omnium._ This was one of the hymns of the catholic
church.

11883. 1 Corinth. xiii, 1.

11894. Matth. vii, 21.

11998. _Thre thynges._ This proverb is frequently quoted by the satirical
and facetious writers of the middle ages. Thus in Chaucer (C. T. 5860):--

  Thou saist, that droppyng houses, and eek smoke,
  And chydyng wyves, maken men to fle
  Out of here oughne hous.

In the poem entitled Golias de Conjuge non ducenda, in Walter Mapes, p. 83,
the proverb is alluded to in the following words:--

  Fumus, et mulier, et stillicidia,
  Expellunt hominem a domo propria.

There was an old French proverbial distich to the same effect,--

  Fumee, pluye, et femme sans raison,
  Chassent l'homme de sa maison.

12040. 2 Corinth. xii, 9.

12097. _to be dubbed._ These and the following lines contain a continued
allusion to the ceremonies of knighthood and tournaments.

12106. Psal. cxvii, 26.

12211. Matth. xxvii, 54.

12232, 12244. _Longeus ... this blynde bacheler._ This alludes to one of
the many legends which the monks engrafted upon the scripture history.
Longeus is said to have been the name of the soldier who pierced the side
of Christ with his spear; and it is pretended that he was previously blind
from his birth, but that the blood of the Saviour ran down his spear, and a
drop of it touching his eye, he was instantly restored to sight, by which
miracle he was converted. See, in illustration of this subject, Halliwell's
Coventry Mysteries, p. 334; The Towneley Mysteries, p. 321; Jubinal,
Mysteres inedits du quinzieme Siecle, tom. ii, pp. 254-257; &c.

12319, 12418, 12420. _Mercy and Truthe, ... Pees ... Rightwisnesse._
Lydgate seems to have had this passage in his mind, when he described the
four sisters in the following lines at the commencement of one of his poems
(MS. Harl. 2255, fol. 21):--

  Mercy and Trouthe mette on an hih mounteyn
  Briht as the sonne with his beemys cleer,
  Pees and Justicia walkyng on the pleyn,
  And with foure sustryn, moost goodly of ther cheer,
  List nat departe nor severe in no maneer,
  Of oon accoord by vertuous encrees,
  Joyned in charite, pryncessis moost enteer,
  Mercy and Trouthe, Rihtwisnesse and Pees.

12361. _a tale of Waltrot._ This name, like Wade in Chaucer, appears to
have been that of a hero of romances and tales, or a personage belonging to
the popular superstitions. Perhaps it may be connected with the old German
_Waltschrat_ (_satyrus_, _pilosus_). See Grimm, Deutsche Mythologie, p.
270.

12438. Psal. xxix, 6.

12566. Matth. xiv, 28.

12599. _a spirit speketh to helle._ The picture of the "Harrowing of Hell,"
which here fol, bears a striking resemblance to the analogous scene in the
old Mysteries, particularly in that edited by Mr. Halliwell under this
title, 8vo, 1840. Compare the play on the same subject in the Towneley
Mysteries, p. 244.

12601. Psal. xxiii, 7, 9.

12645, 12669, 12676. _sevene hundred wynter ... thritty wynter ... two and
thritty wynter._ Our Anglo-Saxon forefathers always counted duration of
time by _winters_ and _nights_; for so many years, they said so many
winters, and so many nights for so many days. This form continued long in
popular usage, and still remains in our words _fortnight_ and _se'nnight_.

12663. _Gobelyn._ Goblin is a name still applied to a devil. It belongs
properly to a being of the old Teutonic popular mythology, a hob-goblin,
the "lubber-fiend" of the poet, and seems to be identical with the German
_kobold_. (See Grimm, Deutsche Mythologie, p. 286.) _Gobelin_ occurs as the
name of one of the shepherds in the Mystery of the Nativity, printed by M.
Jubinal in his Mysteres inedits, vol. ii, p. 71. It occurs as the name of a
devil in a song of the commencement of the fourteenth century, Political
Songs, p. 238:--

  Sathanas huere syre
    Seyde on is sawe,
  Gobelyn made is gerner
    Of gromene mawe.

12679. _to warne Pilates wif._ This is an allusion to a popular legend
prevalent at this time that the devil wished to hinder Christ's
crucifixion, and that he appeared to Pilate's wife in a dream, and caused
her to beseech her husband not to condemn the Saviour. It was founded on
the passage in Matthew xxvii, 19. Sedente autem illo pro tribunali, misit
ad eum uxor ejus, dicens: Nihil tibi et justo illi: multa enim passa sum
hodie per visum propter eum. The most complete illustration of the passage
of Piers Ploughman will be found in Halliwell's Coventry Mysteries, p. 308,
"Pilate's Wife's Dream."

12691. _And now I se wher a soule | Cometh hiderward seillynge, | With
glorie, &c._ With this beautiful passage may be compared a very similar one
in the Samson Agonistes of Milton:--

  But who is this, what thing of sea or land?
  Female of sex it seems,
  That so bedeck'd, ornate and gay,
  _Comes this way sailing_
  Like a stately ship
  Of Tarsus, bound for th' isles
  Of Javan or Gadire,
  With all her bravery on, and tackle trim.

12753. _y-lik a lusard._ In the illuminations of manuscripts representing
the scene of the temptation, the serpent is often figured with legs like a
lizard or crocodile, and a human face.

12759. Matth. v, 38.

12781. Matth. v, 17.

12801. _thorugh a tree._ Some of the medieval legends go still farther, and
pretended that the tree from which the wood of the cross was made was
descended directly from a plant from the tree in Paradise of which Adam and
Eve were tempted to eat the fruit.

12805. Psal. vii, 16.

12840. Psal. l, 6.

12876. 2 Corinth. xii, 4.

12886. Psal. cxlii, 2.

12896. _Astroth._ This name, as given to one of the devils, occurs in a
curious list of actors in the Miracle Play of St. Martin, given by M.
Jubinal, in the preface to his Mysteres inedits, vol. ii, p. ix. It is
similarly used in the Miracle Play of the Martyrdom of St. Peter and St.
Paul, Jubinal, ib. vol. i, p. 69. In one of the Towneley Mysteries (p.
246), this name is likewise given to one of the devils:--

  Calle up _Astarot_ and Anaballe,
  To gyf us counselle in this case.

12937. Psal. lxxxiv, 11.

12943. Psal. cxxxii, 1.

13222. 1 Sam. xviii, 7.

13274. Luke xxiv, 46.

13317. John xx, 29.

13375. _Veni creator spiritus._ The first line of the hymn at vespers, on
the feast of Pentecost.

13412. 1 Corinth. xii, 4.

13550. Cato, Distich. 14, lib. ii:--

  Esto forti animo cum sis damnatus inique;
  Nemo diu gaudet qui judice vincit iniquo.

13789. _I knew nevere cardynal._ The contributions levied upon the clergy
for the support of the pope's messengers and agents was a frequent subject
of complaint in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.

13807. _At Avynone among the Jewes._ In the middle ages there was a large
congregation of Jews at Avignon, as in most of the principal cities in the
south of France. In the civil dissensions which disturbed Italy during this
century, the pope was frequently obliged to take shelter at Avignon and
other places within the French territory.

13825. Matth. v, 45.

13855. Rom. xii, 19; Hebr. x, 30.

14142. _Kynde cessede._ The lines which follow contain an allusion to the
dissipation of manners which followed the pestilence.

14191, 14196. _Westmynstre Halle ... the Arches._ The law courts have been
held at Westminster from the earliest Anglo-Norman times, it being the
king's chief palace. The court of the arches was a very ancient consistory
court of the archbishop of Canterbury, held at Bow church in London, which
was called St. Mary de Arcubus or St. Mary le Bow, from the circumstance of
its having been built on arches.

14211. _leet daggen hise clothes._ An account of the mode in which the rich
fashionable robes of the dandies of the fourteenth century were dagged, or
cut in slits at the edges and borders, will be found in any work on
costume: it is frequently represented in the contemporary illuminations in
manuscripts. Chaucer, in the "Persones Tale," when treating of pride and of
the "superfluitee of clothing," speaks of "the costlewe furring in hir
gounes, so moche pounsoning of chesel to maken holes, so moche _dagging of
sheres_," &c. And again, "if so be that they wolden yeve swiche pounsoned
and _dagged_ clothing to the povre peple, it is not convenient to were for
hir estate," &c. In the Alliterative Poem on the Deposition of Richard II
(printed for the Camden Society), p. 21, the clergy is blamed for not
preaching against the new fashions in dress:--

  For wolde they blame the burnes
  That broughte newe gysis,
  And dryve out _the dagges_
  And alle the Duche cotis.

Whitaker gives the following singular explanation of this passage:--"_Let
dagge hus clothes_, probably, let them fall to the ground, or divested
himself of them; for warriors are 'succinct' for battle as well as 'for
speed!'"

14269. _A glazene howve._ I suppose this means that, in return for his
gold, Physic gave him a hood of glass, _i. e._ a very frail protection for
his person.

14367. _of the Marche of Walys._ Whitaker's text reads, _of the Marche of
Yrelonde_. The clergy of the Welsh border appear, from allusions in other
works, to have been proverbial for their ignorance and irregularity of
life.

14438. Psal. cxlvi, 4.

14444. _wage menne to werre._ This is a curious account of the composition
of an army in the fourteenth century.

14482. Exod. xx, 17.

14511. _suffre the dede in dette_, _i. e._, The friars persuade people to
leave to them, under pretence of saving their souls, the property which was
due to their creditors, and thus, after their death, their debts remain
unpaid.

14615, 14617. _this lymytour ... he salvede so oure wommen._ The whole of
this passage, taken with what precedes, is an amusing satire upon the
limitour. Compare the description of the limitour given by Chaucer in the
Canterbury Tales, ll. 208-271, who alludes to his kindness for the women.
The limitour was a friar licensed to visit and beg within certain limits.
His pertinacity and inquisitiveness in visiting, alluded to in the name
given him in Piers Ploughman (Sir Penetrans-domos), is admirably satirized
by Chaucer, in the opening of the "Wif of Bathes Tale:"--

  In olde dayes of the kyng Arthour,
  Of which that Britouns speken gret honour,
  Al was this lond fulfilled of fayrie;
  The elf-queen, with hir joly compaignye,
  Daunced ful oft in many a grene mede.
  This was the old oppynyoun, as I rede
  I speke of many hundrid yer ago;
  But now can no man see noon elves mo.
  For now the grete charite and prayeres
  Of lymytours and other holy freres,
  That sechen every lond and every streem,
  As thik as motis in the sonne-beem,
  Blesynge halles, chambres, kichenes, and boures,
  Citees and burghes, castels hihe, and toures,
  Thropes and bernes, shepnes and dayeries,
  This makith that ther ben no fayeries:
  For ther as wont was to walken an elf,
  Ther walkith noon but the lymytour himself,
  In undermeles and in morwenynges,
  And saith his matyns and his holy thinges,
  As he goth in his lymytacioun.

------

NOTES TO THE CREED.

65. _a Minoure._ These were the Gray or Franciscan Friars, founded at the
beginning of the thirteenth century by St. Francis of Assise. They are
supposed to have come to England in 1224, when they settled, first at
Canterbury, and afterwards at London.

75. _a Carm._ 95. _Maries men._ The Carmelites, or White Friars, pretended
to be of great antiquity, and were originally established at Mount Carmel,
from whence they were driven by the Saracens about the year 1238. They were
brought into England in 1244, and settled first at Alnwick in
Northumberland, and at Ailesford in Kent.

About the date (or a little before) of our poem, the Carmelites appear to
have been very active in asserting in a boasting manner the superiority of
their order over the others. An anecdote told by Fuller (History of
Cambridge, p. 113), under the year 1371, affords a curious illustration.
"John Stokes, a Dominican, born at Sudbury, in Suffolk, but studying in
Cambridge, as champion of his order, fell foul on the Carmelites, chiefly
for calling themselves 'The brothers of the Blessed Virgin,' and then by
consequence all knew whose uncle they pretend themselves. He put them to
prove their pedigree by Scripture, how the kindred came in. In brief, Bale
saith, 'he left red notes in the white coats of the Carmelites,' he so
belaboured them with his lashing language. But John Hornby a Carmelite
(born at Boston in Lincolnshire) undertook him, called by Bale Cornutus, by
others Hornet-bee, so stinging his stile. He proved the brothership of his
order to the Virgin Mary by visions, allowed true by the infallible popes,
so that no good Christian durst deny it."

130. _Freres of the Pye._ The Fratres de Pica, or Friars of the Pye, are
said to have received their name from the circumstance of their wearing
their outer garment black and white like a magpie. Very little is known of
their history. They are said to have had but one house in England.

143. _Robartes men._ See before the notes on the Vision, ll. 88 and ll.
3410.

155. _miracles of mydwyves._ The monks had many relics and superstitious
practices to preserve and aid women in childbirth. One of the commissioners
for the suppression of the monasteries mentions among the relics of a house
he had visited, "Mare Magdalens girdell, and yt is wrappyde and coveride
with white, sent also with gret reverence to women traveling:" he had
previously spoken of "oure Lades gyrdell of Bruton, rede silke, wiche is a
solemne reliquie sent to women travelyng wiche shall not miscarie _in
partu_." (MS. Cotton. Cleop. E. iv, fol. 249.) See the account of a gem,
which had a similar virtue, in Matthew Paris's History of the Abbots of St.
Albans.

305. _the Prechoures._ The Black Friars, or Dominicans, were founded by St.
Dominic, a Spanish monk of the end of the eleventh century. They were
called Friars Preachers, because their chief duty was to preach and convert
heretics. They came into England in 1221, and had their first houses in
Oxford.

327. _posternes in privite._ These private posterns are frequently alluded
to in the reports of the Commissioners for the Dissolution of the
Monasteries in the reign of Henry VIII. One of them, speaking of the abbey
of Langden, says, "Wheras immediatly descendying fro my horse, I sent
Bartlett your servant, with all my servantes to circumcept the abbay and
surely to kepe _all bake dorres and startyng hoilles_, and I myself went
alone to the abbottes logeying joyning upon the feldes and wode, _evyn lyke
a cony clapper full of startyng hoilles_." (MS. Cotton. Cleop. E. iv, fol.
127.) Another commissioner (MS. Cotton. Cleop. E. iv, fol. 35), in a letter
concerning the monks of the Charter-house in London, says, "These
charterhowse monkes wolde be callyde solytary, but to the cloyster dore
ther be above xxiiij. keys in the handes of xxiiij. persons, and hit is
lyke my letters, unprofytable tayles and tydinges and sumtyme perverse
concell commythe and goythe by reason therof. Allso to the buttrey dore
ther be xij. sundrye keys in xij. [mens] handes wherin symythe to be small
husbandrye."

351. _merkes of merchauntes._ Their ciphers or badges painted in the
windows. For examples, see the note in Warton's History of English Poetry,
vol. ii, p. 98, last edition.

481. _euelles._ Perhaps for _evel-les_, _i. e._ without evil.

534. _the Austyns._ The Austin Friars, or Friars Eremites of the order of
St. Augustine, came into England about the year 1250. Before the end of the
fourteenth century they possessed a great number of houses in this island.

566. _the foure ordres._ The four principal orders of Mendicant Friars. See
note on the Vision, l. 116.

721. _harkne at Herdforthe._ This appears to be an allusion to some event
which had recently occurred among the Franciscans at Hertford, or at
Hereford: if the latter, perhaps they had been active in the persecution of
Walter Brut. See below, l. 1309.

745. _than ther lefte in Lucifere._ Than there existed in Lucifer, before
his fall. See before, the note on l. 681 of the Vision.

771. _couuen_. Probably an error of the old printed edition for _connen_.

869. _lath._ Perhaps an error of the printer of the first edition for
_lay_.

911. Matth. vii, 15.

913. _werwolves._ People who had the power of turning themselves into, or
were turned into, wolves. This fearful superstition, which is very ancient,
was extremely prevalent in the middle ages. In French they were called
_Loup-garous_. The history of a personage of this kind forms the subject of
the Lai de Bisclaveret, by Marie de France. Sir Frederick Madden has
published a very remarkable Early-English metrical romance on the subject
of "William and the Werwolf." See on this superstition Grimm's Deutsche
Mythologie, pp. 620-622.

954. _Golias._ There is perhaps here an allusion to the famous satire on
the Monkish orders entitled Apocalypsis Goliae, printed among the poems of
Walter Mapes.

967. _the kynrede of Caym._ In the popular belief of the middle ages,
hob-goblins and evil spirits (which haunted the wilds and the waters)
literally, and bad men figuratively, were represented as being descended
from the first murderer, Cain. In Old-English poetry, _Caymes kyn_ is a
common epithet for very wicked people. In the Anglo-Saxon romance of
Beowulf, the Grendel is said to be of "Cain's kin."

1051. _wytnes on Wyclif._ In the persecutions to which Wycliffe was
subjected for his opinions in 1382, his most violent opponents were the
Mendicants. He died in 1384, quietly at his living of Lutterworth.

1189. _a lymytoure._ See before, the note on l. 14615 of the Vision.

1178. _stumlen in tales._ An allusion to the idle and superstitious tales
with which the monks filled their sermons, in place of simple and sound
doctrine.

1309. _Water Brut._ Walter Brut (or Bright) was a native of Herefordshire,
and was prosecuted by the Bishop of Hereford for heresy in 1393. A long
account of his defence will be found in Foxe's Acts and Monuments.

1401. _Hildegare._ I suppose this refers to St. Hildegardis, a nun who
flourished in the middle of the twelfth century, and who was celebrated
among the Roman Catholics as a prophetess. Her prophecies are not uncommon
in manuscripts, and they have been printed. Those which relate to the
future corruptions in the monkish orders are given in Foxe's Acts and
Monuments, book vi, and in other works.

GLOSSARY.

    [The figures in the following Glossary refer to the _page_ of the text.
    Words preceded by a +, occur only in the CREED. A.S. and A.N.
    distinguish the two different languages of which our own is composed,
    Anglo-Saxon and Anglo-Norman.]

  A.

a, prefixed to verbs of Anglo-Saxon origin, has sometimes a negative,
sometimes an intensative power: before nouns and adjectives it represents
_on_ and _at_, as, a-brood, a-fore (aet-foran), a-rowe (i. e. _on a row_),
a-loft (i. e. _on high_), &c. In words of Anglo-Norman origin, it answers
to the prepositions, _a_, _ab_, _ad_, of the original Latin words

a (A.N.) 355, _ah!_ (an interjection)

abidynge (A.S.) 413, _patient_

abiggen (A.S.) 35, 127, abien, 58, abugge, 122, abye, 164, abyen, 393, _to
make amends for_, _to atone for_. _pret. s._ aboughte, 168, 190, 231, 268.
_part. past_, abought, 392

abite (A.S.) 331, _to bite, nip_

a-blende (A.S.) 377, a-blynden, _to blinde, dazzle_. _pret. s._ a-blente,
388

abosten (A.N.) 126, _to assault_

abouten, aboute (A.S.) _about_

a-brood (A.S.) _abroad_

ac (A.S.) _but, and_

a-cale (A.S.) 393, _cold_. It occurs in the Romance of the Seven Sages
(Weber, p. 59):

  That night he sat wel sore _a-kale_,
  And his wif lai warme a-bedde.

accidie (A.N.) 99, _sloth, a fit of slothfulness_

acombren (A.N.) _to embarrass, bring into trouble_

acorden (A.N.) _to agree, accord_

acorse, acursen (A.S.) 375, _to curse._ acorsed, 375, _accursed_

acoupen (A.N.) 272, _to blame, accuse._ (for acoulpen)

a-drad (A.S.) 397, _afraid_

a-drenchen (A.S.) 198, _to drown_

afaiten, 291, affaiten 81, 119, (A.N.) _to tame_

a-feren (A.S.) 395, 435, _to frighten_, _drive away_. a-fered, 376,
_afraid_, _terrified_

affraynen (A.S.) 347, _to ask_, _question_, _interrogate_

aforthe (A.S.) 129, _to afford_

afrounte (A.N.) _to encounter_, _attack_, _accost rudely_. _pret. s._
afrounted, 425

a-fyngred (A.S.) 133, 176, 283, 403, _a-hungered_, _hungry_

a-furst (A.S.) 176, 283, _a-thirst_, _thirsty_. The two forms, _a-fyngred_
and _a-furst_, appear to be characteristic of the dialect of the counties
which lay on the Welsh border. They occur once or twice in MS. Harl. 2253,
which, in my Specimens of Lyric Poetry, I have shown to have been written
in Herefordshire. They also occur in several other manuscripts which may
probably be traced to that part of England. In the Romance of Horn, in the
MS. just mentioned, we have the lines:--

  Horn set at grounde,
  Him thohte he wes y-bounde,
  He seide, Quene, so hende,
  To me hydeward thou wende.
  Thou shench us with the vurste,
  The beggares bueth _a-furste_.

i. e. the beggars are thirsty. Whitaker gives a very remarkable translation
of _a-furst and a-fyngred_, i. e. _frost-bitten, and with aching fingers_.
Ritson has no less inaccurately explained _a-furste_ in the Romance of
Horn, by _at first_: the Cambridge MS. of this Romance, earlier and better
than the MS. Harl., reads:--

  Thu gef us with the furste,
  The beggeres beoth _of thurste_.

bosarde (A.N.) 189, _a worthless or useless fellow_. It is properly the
name of a worthless species of hawk, which is unfit for sporting; and is
thus used in Chaucer's version of the Romance of the Rose, l. 4033:--

  This have I herde ofte in saying,
  That man ne maie for no daunting
  Make a sperhawke of _a bosarde_.

The original is,--

  Ce oi dire en reprovier,
  Que l'en ne puet fere espervier
  En nule guise _d'ung busart_.

speaking of Arcite and Palamon, says they--"foughten breme, as it were
bolles two," _fought as fiercely as two bulls_. In the Romance of Sir
Amadas (Weber, p. 250) a person is described as coming "lyke a breme bare,"
_like a fierce boar_. It appears to be most commonly applied to animals. In
the Towneley Mysteries, p. 197, Anna says to Cayphas, "Be not to breme,"
_be not too fierce_

y-brought, broght, 235

brocage (A.N.) 33, 289, _a treaty by a broker or agent_. It is particularly
applied to treaties of marriage, brought about in this way. In Chaucer's
Romance of the Rose, l. 6971, Fals Semblant says,--

  I entremete me of _brocages_.
  I maken pece, and mariages.

So in the Miller's Tale (C.T. 3375), it is said of Absolon,

  He woweth hire by mene and by _brocage_,
  And swor he wolde ben hir owne page.

That is, he wooed her by the agency of another person, whom he employed to

suffer punishment in hell:--

  In bras and in bronston the _brethellys_ be brent,
  That wene in this werd my wyl for to werke.

In another play in the same collection, p. 217, it is applied to the woman
taken in adultery:--

  And more we se of Goddis secre thinges,
  Than _borel folk_, although that thay ben kinges,
  We lyve in povert and in abstinence,
  And _borel folk_ in riches and dispence.

The hoste says (l. 15440)--

  Religioun hath take up al the corn
  Of tredyng, and we _burel men_ ben schrympes.

_Borel folk_ and _borel men_ evidently mean _laymen_

_maugre thin eyen_, _maugre hire hed_, &c. See Tyrwhit's Gloss, v.
_Maugre_. One of these instances is exactly analogous to the passage of
Piers Ploughman (C. T. l. 6467):--

  And happed, al alone as sche was born,
  He saugh a mayde walkyng him by-forn,
  Of which mayden anoon _maugre hir heed_,
  By verray fors byraft hir maydenhed.

cliket (A.N.) 114, _a kind of latch key_. cliketten, 114, _to fasten with a
cliket_. Tyrwhit explains the word simply as meaning a key--but in Piers
Ploughman it is put so in immediate apposition with the word key, that it
must have differed from it. In Chaucer, C. T. 9990, et seq. it appears to
be the key of a garden gate:--

  This freissche May, that I spake of so yore,
  In warm wex hath emprynted the _cliket_
  That January bar of the smale wiket,
  By which into his gardyn ofte he went;
  And Damyan, that knew al hir entent,
  The _cliket_ counterfeted prively.

In a document of the date 1416, quoted by Ducange, v. _Cliquetus_, it is
ordered that, Refectorarius semper teneat hostium refectorii clausum _cum
cliqueto_

clyngen (A.S.) 276, _to shrink, wither, pine_. Reliq. Antiquae, vol. ii, p.
210:--

+cofrene (A.N.) 455, _to put in a coffer_

coghen (A.S.) 367, _to cough_

coke (A.S.) _a cook_

cokeney (A.N.) 134, _some kind of meager food, probably a young or small
cock, which had little flesh on its bones_. This meaning of the word (which
has been misunderstood) may be gathered from a comparison of the passage in
Piers Ploughman with one in the "Turnament of Tottenham," where the writer
intended to satirize the poorness of the fare:--

  At that fest were thei servyd in a rich aray,
  Every fyve and fyve had _a cokeney_.

Heywood, in his Proverbs, part i, chap. xi, gives a proverb in which the
word is evidently used in the same sense, and appears to be intentionally
contrasted with a _fat hen_:--

                            --Men say,
  He that comth every daie shall have _a cocknaie_,
  He that comth now and then, shall have a fat hen;
  But I gat not so muche in comyng seelde when,
  As a goode hens fether or a poore egshell.

I think that _cokenay_ in Chaucer is the same word, used metaphorically to
signify a person without worth or courage (C. T. 4205):--

  And when this jape is tald another day,
  I sal be hald a daf, _a cokenay_.

associate, apparently without any bad sense. Thus the romance of Beowulf
speaks of the armour of one of the heroes:--

  thaet Onela for-geaf,
  his gaedelinges
  gudh-ge-waedu.
  _which Onela had given him,
  the war-weeds of his comrade,
  the ready implements of war._

  And the beest begyn to renne, as hartes ben wonte,
  Or for to _hanylon_, as dooth the foxe wyth his gyle,

harlot (A.N.) 175, 270, 271, 303, 354, _a blackguard, person of infamous
life_. The word was used in both genders. It appears to have answered
exactly to the French _ribaud_, as Chaucer in the Romance of the Rose
translates _roy des ribaulx_, by _king of harlots_. Chaucer says of the
Sompnour (C. T. l. 649):--

  He was a _gentil harlot_ and a kynde
  A bettre felaw schulde men nowher fynde.
  He wolde suffre for a quart of wyn,
  A good felawe to ban his concubyn,
  A twelve moneth, and excuse him atte fulle.

This passage gives us a remarkable trait of the character of the ribald, or
harlot, who formed a peculiar class of middle-age society. Among some old
glosses in the Reliquiae Antiquae (vol. i, p. 7), we find "_scurra_, a
harlotte." In the Coventry Mystery of the Woman taken in Adultery (p. 217),
it is the young man who is caught with the woman, and not the woman
herself, who is stigmatised as a _harlot_.

harpen (A.S.) _to harp_. _pret. pl._ harpeden, 394

harrow (A.N.) 430, an exclamation, or rather a cry, said to have been
peculiar to the Normans, the origin and derivation of which have been the
subject of much discussion among antiquaries. It was the cry which every
one was bound to raise and repeat, when any murder, theft, robbery, or
other violent crime, was attempted or perpetrated, in order that the
offenders might be hindered or secured. It was afterwards used in any great
tumult or disorder, and became a general exclamation of persons wanting
help. (See Ducange, in v. _Haro_.) In the Towneley Mysteries (p. 14), when
Cain finds that his offering will not burn, he cries:--

  We! out! haro! help to blaw!
  It wille not bren for me, I traw.

sweorda ge-lac, _the play of swords_

  Al thilke night, ne how the Grekes pleye.

In the romance of Alexander (Weber, p. 145), the word is applied to a

    _he put the armour on his body_

lollynge, 346

lolleris (A.S.) 308, _lollards_. The origin of this word is doubtful, but
it seems to mean generally people who go about from place to place with a
hypocritical show of praying and devotion. It was certainly in use long
before the time of the Wycliffites, in Germany as well as in England.
Johannes Hocsemius (quoted by Ducange, v. _Lollardi_) says, in his
chronicle on the year 1309, "Eodem anno quidam hypocritae gyrovagi, qui
_Lollardisive Deum laudantes_ vocabantur, per Hannoniam et Brabantiam
quasdam mulieres nobiles deceperunt," &c. The term, used in the time of
Piers Ploughman as one of reproach, was afterwards contemptuously given to
the church reformers. The writer of the Ploughman's Tale, printed in
Chaucer, Speght, fol. 86, appears to apply it to wandering friars:--

  i-cleped _lollers_ and londlese.

lomere (A.S.) 439, _more frequently_

lond-buggere (A.S.) 191, _a buyer of land_

+lone (A.S.) 493, _a loan_ (?)

loof (A.S.) _a loaf_

loone (A.S.) 442, _a loan_. lenger yeres loone, _a loan of a year longer, a

loos (A.S.) 219, _honour, praise_

lorel (A.N.) 147, 294, 351, 369, _a bad man, a good-for-nothing fellow_.
Chaucer, in his translation of Boethius, uses it to represent the Latin
_perditissimus_. Compare the description of the _lorel_ in the Ploughman's
Tale (Speght's Chaucer) fol. 91:--

  For thou canst no cattell gete,
  But livest in lond as a _lorell_,
  With glosing gettest thou thy mete.

losel (A.N.) 5, 124, 176, 303, _a wretch, good-for-nothing fellow_. It
appears to be a different form of the preceding word. loselly, 240, _in a
disgraceful, good-for-nothing manner_

lothen (A.S.) _to loath_

looth (A.S.) _loath, hateful_. lother, 318, _more loath_. lothliche,
_hateful_

lotebies (A.S. ?) 52, _private companions, bed-fellows_. In the romance of
the Seven Sages (Weber, p. 57) it is said of a woman unfaithful to her
husband:--

  Sche stal a-wai, mididone,
  And wente to here _lotebi_.

Chaucer uses the word (in the romance of the Rose, l. 6339), in a passage
rather similar to this of Piers Ploughman:--

  Now am I yong and stout and bolde,
  Now am I Robert, now Robin,
  Now frere Minor now Jacobin,
  And _with me followeth my loteby_,
  To don me solace and company.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
