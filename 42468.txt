"We strongly recommend this 'Story of the Campaign' to all who would
gain a just comprehension of this tremendous struggle. Of this we are
perfectly sure, it is a book unlikely to be ever superseded. Its truth
is of that simple and startling character which is sure of an immortal
existence; nor is it paying the gallant author too high a complement to
class this masterpiece of military history with the most precious of
those classic records which have been bequeathed to us by the great
writers of antiquity who took part in the wars they have
described."--_The Press._

France than this, which professes to be the impressions of a Flaneur....
It has all the liveliness and sparkle of a work written only for
amusement; it has all the solidity and weight of a State paper; and we
expect for it not a little political influence as a fair, full, and
masterly statement of the Imperial policy--the first and only good
account that has been given to Europe of the Napoleonic system now in
force."--_Times._

it."--_London Guardian._


 _THE NATIONAL CHARACTER OF THE ATHENIANS._

"We know not in the English language where else to look for a history of
the Roman law so clear, and, at the same time, so short.... More
improving reading, both for the general student and for the lawyer, we
cannot well imagine; and there are few, even among learned professional
men, who will not gather some novel information from Lord Mackenzie's
simple pages."--_London Review._

    Britain. By AGNES STRICKLAND. With Portraits and Historical
    Vignettes. Post 8vo, L4, 4s.

"Every step in Scotland is historical: the shades of the dead arise on
every side; the very rocks breathe. Miss Strickland's talents as a
writer, and turn of mind as an individual, in a peculiar manner fit her
for painting a historical gallery of the most illustrious or dignified
female characters in that land of chivalry and song."--_Blackwood's
Magazine._

    including Communications from the Rev. R. H. BARHAM, Author of the
    'Ingoldsby Legends.' In 8vo, with Engravings, 16s.

"'The Boscobel Tracts' is a very curious book, and about as good an
example of single subject historical collections as may be found.
Originally undertaken, or at least completed, at the suggestion of the
late Bishop Copplestone, in 1827, it was carried out with a degree of
judgment and taste not always found in works of a similar
character."--_Spectator._

    DUNDEE--WILLIAM PENN. By John Paget, Esq., Barrister-at-Law. In
    Crown 8vo, 6s.

"We certainly never saw a more damaging exposure, and it is something
worth notice that much of it appeared in 'Blackwood's Magazine' during
the lifetime of Lord Macaulay, but he never attempted to make any reply.
The charges are so direct, and urged in such unmistakable language, that
no writer who valued his character for either accuracy of fact or
fairness in comment would let them remain unanswered if he had any
reason to give."--_Gentleman's Magazine._


 _AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF THE REV. DR CARLYLE_,
    Minister of Inveresk. Containing Memorials of the Men and Events of
    his Time. Edited by JOHN HILL BURTON. In 8vo. Third Edition, with
    Portrait, 14s.

"This book contains by far the most vivid picture of Scottish life and
manners that has been given to the public since the days of Sir Walter
Scott. In bestowing upon it this high praise, we make no exception, not
even in favour of Lord Cockburn's 'Memorials'--the book which resembles
it most, and which ranks next to it in interest."--_Edinburgh Review._


 _MEMOIR OF THE POLITICAL LIFE OF EDMUND BURKE._

crowded before into the same canvass."--_Times._

"It is of the handiest of sizes; the paper is good; and the type, which
seems to be new, is very clear and beautiful. There are no pictures. The
whole charm of the presentment of the volume consists in its handiness,
and the tempting clearness and beauty of the type, which almost converts
into a pleasure the mere act of following the printer's lines, and
leaves the author's mind free to exert its unobstructed force upon the
reader."--_Examiner._

"Nothing could be better as to size, type, paper, and general
get-up."--_Athenaeum._

    WALKER, &c., Engraved by WHYMPER. Crown 8vo, 6s.

"Everybody who has failed to read 'Tom Cringle's Log' should do so at
once. The 'Quarterly Review' went so far as to say that the papers
composing it, when it first appeared in 'Blackwood,' were the most
brilliant series of the time, and that time one unrivalled for the
number of famous magazinists existing in it. Coleridge says, in his
'Table Talk,' that the 'Log' is most excellent; and these verdicts have
been ratified by generations of men and boys, and by the manifestation
of Continental approval which is shown by repeated translations. The
engravings illustrating the present issue are excellent."--_Standard._

 _CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFORD: SALEM CHAPEL._
    Second Edition. Complete in 1 vol., price 5s.

"This story, so fresh, so powerfully written, and so tragic, stands out
from among its fellows like a piece of newly-coined gold in a handful of
dim commonplace shillings. Tales of pastoral experience and scenes from
clerical life we have had in plenty, but the sacred things of the
conventicle, the relative position of pastor and flock in a
Nonconforming 'connection,' were but guessed at by the world outside,
and terrible is the revelation."--_Westminster Review._

    By JOHN HILL BURTON. New Edition. In Crown 8vo, 7s. 6d.

"A book pleasant to look at and pleasant to read--pleasant from its rich
store of anecdote, its geniality, and its humour, even to persons who
care little for the subjects of which it treats, but beyond measure
delightful to those who are in any degree members of the above-mentioned
fraternity."--_Saturday Review._

"We have not been more amused for a long time: and every reader who
takes interest in typography and its consequences will say the same, if
he will begin to read; beginning, he will finish, and be sorry when it
is over."--_Athenaeum._

"Mr Burton has now given us a pleasant book, full of quaint anecdote,
and of a lively bookish talk. There is a quiet humour in it which is
very taking, and there is a curious knowledge of books which is really
very sound."--_Examiner._

    Eighteenth Edition. Fcap. 8vo, 7s. 6d.

"Professor Aytoun's 'Lays of the Scottish Cavaliers'--a volume of verse
which shows that Scotland has yet a poet. Full of the true fire, it now
stirs and swells like a trumpet-note--now sinks in cadences sad and wild
as the wail of a Highland dirge."--_Quarterly Review._

"No country can boast of a richer collection of Ballads than Scotland,
and no Editor for these Ballads could be found more accomplished than
Professor Aytoun. He has sent forth two beautiful volumes which range
with 'Percy's Reliques'--which, for completeness and accuracy, leave
little to be desired--which must henceforth be considered as the
standard edition of the Scottish Ballads, and which we commend as a
model to any among ourselves who may think of doing like service to the
English Ballads."--_Times._

    STANHOPE WORSLEY, M.A., Scholar of Corpus Christi College. 2 vols.
    Crown 8vo, 18s.

"Mr Worsley,--applying the Spenserian stanza, that beautiful romantic
measure, to the most romantic poem of the ancient world--making the
stanza yield him, too (what it never yielded to Byron), its treasures of
fluidity and sweet ease--above all, bringing to his task a truly
poetical sense and skill,--has produced a version of the 'Odyssey' much
the most pleasing of those hitherto produced, and which is delightful to
read."--_Professor Arnold on Translating Homer._

"There has been no modern poem in the English language, of the class to
which the 'Course of Time' belongs, since Milton wrote, that can be
compared to it. In the present instance the artistic talents of Messrs
FOSTER, CLAYTON, TENNIEL, EVANS, DALZIEL, GREEN, and WOODS, have been
employed in giving expression to the sublimity of the language, by
equally exquisite illustrations, all of which are of the highest
class."--_Bell's Messenger._

manifestations of life on the earth set forth in so clear an order, or
traced so vividly from the earliest organisms deep-buried in its
stratified crust, to the familiar forms that now adorn and people its
surface."--_Literary Gazette._

Messrs Blackwood & Sons, this Royal Atlas will be the most useful to the

"They are noble sermons; and we are not sure but that, with the
cultivated reader, they will gain rather than lose by being read, not
heard. There is a thoughtfulness and depth about them which can hardly
be appreciated, unless when they are studied at leisure; and there are
so many sentences so felicitously expressed that we should grudge being
hurried away from them by a rapid speaker, without being allowed to
enjoy them a second time."--_Fraser's Magazine._

    Political Economy, St Andrews. Second Edition. Crown 8vo, 10s. 6d.

"We have no doubt, however, that the subtlety and depth of metaphysical

style on almost every page, must secure for it a distinguished place in
the history of philosophical discussion."--_Tulloch's Burnett Prize

"The best account that has yet been written of the national life and
being of Scotland."--_Times._

"One of the completest histories that we ever saw of any
country."--_Saturday Review._

"Not only the most complete and trustworthy history of Scotland yet
written, but it will merit a high place among the historical works of
our age."--_Daily News._

"A great contribution to historical literature."--_Scotsman._

"We do not remember to have read so reticent, so calm and dispassionate
a history."--_Blackwood's Magazine._

"Une grande et belle histoire."--_Revue des Deux Mondes._

"This admirable book."--_Morning Herald._


 =COUNT MONTALEMBERT'S HISTORY OF THE MONKS=

    (III. to V.), contain the History of the Conversion of England by
    the Monks, and may be had as a complete book, price 31s. 6d.

"On the whole, the intellectual interest of the Count's 'Monks of the
West' rests mainly on this, that it is the work of a brilliant and
accomplished layman and man of the world, dealing with a class of
characters who have generally been left to the arid professional
handling of ecclesiastical writers. Montalembert sees their life as a
whole, and a human whole; and, with all his zeal as an amateur
hagiographer, he cannot but view them with some of the independence of a
mind trained to letters and politics."--_Pall Mall Gazette._

"Not only are the present territorial adjustments duly registered in all
these maps, but the latest discoveries in Central Asia, in Africa, and
America have been delineated with laborious fidelity. Indeed the ample
illustration of recent discovery, and of the great groups of
dependencies on the British Crown, renders Dr Johnston's the best of all
Atlases for English use."--_Pall Mall Gazette._

"He has given us in a portable form geography posted to the last
discovery and the last Revolution."--_Saturday Review._

"This is Mr Keith Johnston's admirable Royal Atlas diminished in bulk
and scale so as to be perhaps, fairly entitled to the name of 'handy,'
but still not so much diminished but what it constitutes an accurate and
useful general Atlas for ordinary households."--_Spectator._

"The 'Handy Atlas' is thoroughly deserving of its name. Not only does it
contain the latest information, but its size and arrangement render it
perfect as a book of reference."--_Standard._

    Chapters. Price 6s.

"Few of our handbooks of popular science can be said to have greater or
more decisive merit than those of Mr Page on Geology and Palaeontology.
They are clear and vigorous in style, they never oppress the reader with
a pedantic display of learning, nor overwhelm him with a pompous and
superfluous terminology; and they have the happy art of taking him
straightway to the face of nature herself, instead of leading him by the
tortuous and bewildering paths of technical system and artificial
classification."--_Saturday Review._

"This is one of the best of Mr Page's many good books. It is written in
a flowing popular style. Without illustration or any extraneous aid, the
narrative must prove attractive to any intelligent reader."--_Geological
Magazine._

"These lectures, in so far as they treat of Greek philosophy down to
Plato, have been carefully elaborated, and are of much value--of higher
value, indeed, than any writings on the same subject in the English
language; and in point of clearness, depth, and resolute search after
truth, and tenacious hold of it when found, we doubt if they are
surpassed in any language.... For our part, we do not know any
philosophical writings so fascinating to a young student of philosophy
as these early pages."--_Scotsman._

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
