                          INTRODUCTORY NOTE

     "In the establishment of the independence of Spanish America
     the United States have the deepest interest. I have no
     hesitation in asserting my firm belief that there is no
     question in the foreign policy of this country, which has ever
     arisen, or which I can conceive as ever occurring, in the
     decision of which we have had or can have so much at
     stake."--Henry Clay, _The Emancipation of South America_.


This syllabus is designed primarily for the use of students of the
University of North Carolina as a guide to the introductory study of
Hispanic-American history. In it an effort has been made to provide
for as general and comprehensive a study of Hispanic-American
civilization as the time limits of a single one year's course would
permit. In such a process, of course, selection and rejection of data
were necessary. The student seeking to specialize will, therefore,
find it possible and easy to elaborate and amplify each of the
chapters and sections into which the outline has been divided. Despite
such comprehensiveness as was mentioned, the writer has endeavored to
emphasize the institutional and economic aspects. The necessity of
elimination and the effort at emphasis have resulted in the relegation
of political history, particularly that of the colonial period, to a
position of comparatively less prominence and significance than some
might expect. For this the writer must plead necessity.

In view of the great contemporary interest in Hispanic America no case
for the study of its history need be made--if such, indeed, is
required for any field of history. That interest in the United States
has been in part due to the construction of the Panama Canal and to
the increasing importance in diplomacy of the Caribbean area, and in
part it may be ascribed to the exigencies and effects of the World War
which have made people conscious of trade opportunities formerly
non-existent or, if existent, not fully recognized; and many have thus
concluded that the diplomatic, political, and economic importance of
Hispanic America has made of prime necessity a thorough study and a
sympathetic understanding of its past history and institutions. These
facts and this new consciousness may indicate the opening of another
period in the history of the Western Hemisphere, which will doubtless
have a distinctly inter-American emphasis. The field of
Hispanic-American history has until recent years been little known to
and too often neglected by the undergraduate student in the
universities,--if, indeed, courses in such history have been offered.
It is, in the opinion of the writer, however, a field not lacking in
comparative importance, interest, and cultural value with those better
known. It is hoped and confidently expected that the interest in the
history and institutions of the Hispanic-American countries recently
engendered by the consciousness that these countries have become
potent economic and political factors in the modern world will be
abiding. Hispanic-American history as a standard course will have much
justification, for the part which the peoples of the southern
republics will play in the future, as Viscount Bryce recently said,
"must henceforth be one of growing significance for the Old World as
well as for the New."

The course as outlined in this syllabus provides for the study of the
history, geography, political and social institutions, and the
economic development and possibilities of Hispanic-American countries.
A careful analysis and investigation will thus be made of the Spanish
and Portuguese colonial systems and colonial experience in order to
explain the wars of independence and the existing political and social
conditions. Attention will then be directed to the development of
republics, the struggle for political stability, and the exploitation
of resources. The course will also include some study of the
international relations--political and economic--and diplomatic
problems which have arisen in recent Hispanic-American history.

At the outset the prospective student is warned that as yet there
exists no single text-book devoted to the Hispanic-American republics
which satisfactorily and adequately presents their history, describes
their present conditions and discusses their institutions. This
absence, of necessity, determines that the course will be based
largely upon material to be found only in a number of books, public
documents, and scientific reports. An effort has been made in this
syllabus to meet this difficult situation. Lectures following the
outline of the syllabus and explanatory of it, and recitations based
on assigned readings, will constitute the class work. On these
lectures and readings the students will be expected to take notes. In
addition, they will be required to make certain class reports and at
least once during the year to prepare, after consultation with the
instructor, an essay on some topic of the syllabus or allied phase of
the work.

Students will be required to provide themselves individually with a
copy of this syllabus and with W. R. Shepherd's _Latin America_ (Holt
& Company). It is strongly recommended that they purchase also F.
Garcia Calderon's _Latin America: Its Rise and Progress_ (Scribners).

The monthly _Bulletin_ and other publications of the Pan-American
Union (Washington, D. C.), offer excellent and reliable information
respecting all of these divisions, and are recommended.

Students wishing to make a more detailed study than this brief list
would provide for can easily find extensive bibliographies on the
subject in English, Portuguese and Spanish which are of great value.
They will do well to consult P. H. Goldsmith, _A Brief Bibliography_
(Macmillan), although it is admittedly incomplete in its list of books
and contemptuously harsh in its judgment of many of those included.
More comprehensive and valuable are the _Bibliographie Hispanique_
(annual, New York) published by the Hispanic Society of America, and
the lists and catalogues of books, pamphlets, periodicals, and maps
prepared by the Pan-American Union and printed by the United States
Government,--first, the list relating to Central America by P. Lee
Phillips, 1902; secondly, the catalogue of books, periodicals, etc.,
in the Columbus Library, which appeared successively in 1905, 1907,
1909, and 1914. Many lists respecting individual Hispanic-American
countries have been published, including Argentina, Brazil, Chile,
Costa Rica, Cuba, Ecuador, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, and Paraguay.
Reference also must necessarily be made to the exhaustive and
scholarly _Biblioteca Hispano-Americana_ and other compilations of
Jose Toribio Medina, the great bibliographer of Chile. _The Hispanic
American Historical Review_ is commended to the student not only for
its own articles and reviews, but for the great service rendered to
the bibliography of this subject by publishing with each issue a list
of books and articles pertaining to the field which have recently
appeared.

The writer would anticipate the criticism that the list of books
specified in the syllabus for reading is incomplete. Since these
readings are designed for class purposes and are selected as being
practicable, the incompleteness was scarcely avoidable. The specialist
will again find it easy to enlarge. In the list of readings, in order
to conserve space, the author's name and full title of the book are
stated when the first reference is made; thereafter only the author's
name is employed, except in such cases in which the author has written
more than one book or in which clearness seems to demand complete or
partial repetition.

The author wishes to make acknowledgment of his indebtedness to
Professor William R. Shepherd, of Columbia University, whose advice
and inspiration have been of incalculable service to him. Professor
Shepherd generously made suggestions for this edition of the syllabus.

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
