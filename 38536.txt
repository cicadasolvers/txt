[Transcriber's Note:

This book includes extensive mathematical expressions and equations,
which can not always be easily represented in plain text. The reader is
encouraged to download the HTML version of the text, which represents
the math more clearly.

For the plain text version, the following conventions are used:

Mixed fractions are represented by a dash with no spaces, while
subtraction is represented by a dash with spaces on either side. For
example: 1-1/2 is "one and one half." 1 - 1/2 is "one minus one half."

The "sideways-8" symbol for infinity is represented as [infinity].

Square, cube, and other roots are shown by raising a quantity to the
appropriate fractional power. For example: [4]^(1/2) is "the square root
of 4." [x]^(1/n) is "the nth root of x."

Extra parentheses have been added as needed to clarify the correct order
of operations.]

PREFACE


In most high schools the course in Elementary Algebra is finished by the
end of the second year. By the senior year, most students have forgotten
many of the principles, and a thorough review is necessary in order to
prepare college candidates for the entrance examinations and for
effective work in the freshman year in college. Recognizing this need,
many schools are devoting at least two periods a week for part of the
senior year to a review of algebra.

For such a review the regular textbook is inadequate. From an
embarrassment of riches the teacher finds it laborious to select the
proper examples, while the student wastes time in searching for
scattered assignments. The object of this book is to conserve the time
and effort of both teacher and student, by providing a thorough and
effective review that can readily be completed, if need be, in two
periods a week for a half year.

Each student is expected to use his regular textbook in algebra for
reference, as he would use a dictionary,--to recall a definition, a
rule, or a process that he has forgotten. He should be encouraged to
_think_ his way out wherever possible, however, and to refer to the
textbook only when _forced_ to do so as a last resort.

The definitions given in the General Outline should be reviewed as
occasion arises for their use. The whole Outline can be profitably
employed for rapid class reviews, by covering the part of the Outline
that indicates the answer, the method, the example, or the formula, as
the case may be.

The whole scheme of the book is ordinarily to have a page of problems
represent a day's work. This, of course, does not apply to the Outlines
or the few pages of theory, which can be covered more rapidly. By this
plan, making only a part of the omissions indicated in the next
paragraph, the essentials of the algebra can be readily covered, if need
be, in from thirty to thirty-two lessons, thus leaving time for tests,
even if only eighteen weeks, of two periods each, are allotted to the
course.

If a brief course is desired, the Miscellaneous Examples (pp. 31 to 35,
50 to 52), many of the problems at the end of the book, and the College
Entrance Examinations may be omitted without marring the continuity or
the comprehensiveness of the review.

CASES IN FACTORING


The number of terms in an expression usually gives the clue to the
possible cases under which it may come. By applying the _test_ for each
and eliminating the _possible_ cases one by one, the right case is
readily found. Hence, the number of terms in the expression and a ready
and accurate knowledge of the Cases in Factoring are the real keys to
success in this vitally important part of algebra.


CASE I. A common monomial factor. Applies to any number of terms.

SIMULTANEOUS EQUATIONS

extent the preceding topics. For example, factoring reviews the
special rules of multiplication and division; H. C. F. and L. C. M.

fractional equations review H. C. F. and L. C. M., etc. From this
point on, however, the interdependence is not so marked, and
miscellaneous examples illustrating the work already covered will
be given very frequently in order to keep the whole subject fresh
in mind.

      second, and 130 feet from the catcher's position to second. A
      runner stealing second has a start of 13 feet when the ball leaves
      the pitcher's hand, and beats the throw to the base by 1/8 of a

      feet, and is caught by 6 feet. What is his rate of running, and

THEORY OF EXPONENTS


Review the proofs, for positive integral exponents, of:

    I. a^m x a^n = a^(m + n).

   II. (a^m)/(a^n) = a^(m - n).

  III. (a^m)^n = a^(mn).

   IV. [a^(mn)]^(1/n) = a^m.

    V. [a/b]^n = (a^n)/(b^n).

   VI. (abc)^n = a^n b^n c^n.


~To find the meaning of a fractional exponent.~

Assume that Law I holds for _all_ exponents.

If so, a^(2/3) . a^(2/3) . a^(2/3) = a^(6/3) = a^2.

Hence, a^(2/3) is _one of the three equal factors_ (hence the cube root)
of a^2.

    Therefore a^(2/3) = [a^2]^(1/3).

In the same way,

    a^(4/5) . a^(4/5) . a^(4/5) . a^(4/5) . a^(4/5) = a^(20/5) = a^4.

Hence, a^(4/5) is _one of the five equal factors_ (hence the fifth root)
of a^4.

    Therefore a^(4/5) = [a^4]^(1/5).

In the same way, in general, a^(p/q) = [a^p]^(1/q).

Hence, _the numerator of a fractional exponent indicates the power, the
denominator indicates the root_.


~To find the meaning of a zero exponent.~

Assume that Law II holds for _all_ exponents.

If so, (a^m)/(a^m) = a^(m - m) = a^0. But by division, (a^m)/(a^m) = 1.

    Therefore a^0 = 1. Axiom I.


~To find the meaning of a negative exponent.~

Assume that Law I holds for _all_ exponents.

If so, a^m x a^(-m) = a^(m - m) = a^0 = 1.

Hence, a^m x a^(-m) = 1.

    Therefore a^(-m) = 1/(a^m).

Rules:

    _To multiply quantities having the same base, add exponents._

    _To divide quantities having the same base, subtract exponents._

    _To raise a quantity to a power, multiply exponents._

    _To extract a root, divide the exponent of the power by the
    index of the root._

The most important principle in Radicals is the following:

THE THEORY OF QUADRATIC EQUATIONS


~I. To find the sum and the product of the roots.~

The general quadratic equation is

        ax^2 + bx + c = 0.                                   (1)

    Or, x^2 + (b/a)x + c/a = 0.                              (2)

To derive the formula, we have by transposing

    x^2 + (b/a)x = -c/a.

Completing the square,

    x^2 + (b/a)x + [b/2a]^2 = (b^2)/(4a^2) - c/a = (b^2 - 4ac)/(4a^2).

Extracting square root, x + b/2a = [+-[b^2 - 4ac]^(1/2)]/(2a).

Transposing, x = -b/2a +- [[b^2 - 4ac]^(1/2)]/(2a).

Hence, x = [-b +- [b^2 - 4ac]^(1/2)]/(2a).

These two values of x we call _roots_.

For convenience represent them by r_1 and r_2.

    Hence,        r_1 = -b/2a + [[b^2 - 4ac]^(1/2)]/(2a).
                  r_2 = -b/2a - [[b^2 - 4ac]^(1/2)]/(2a).
            ---------------------------------------------
    Adding, r_1 + r_2 = -(2b)/(2a) = -b/a.                   (3)

    Also,            r_1 = -b/2a + [[b^2 - 4ac]^(1/2)]/(2a).
                     r_2 = -b/2a - [[b^2 - 4ac]^(1/2)]/(2a).
                 -------------------------------------------
    Multiplying, r_1 r_2 = (b^2)/(4a^2) - (b^2 - 4ac)/(4a^2)
                         = (b^2 - b^2 + 4ac)/(4a^2)
                         = (4ac)/(4a^2) = c/a.               (4)

Hence we have shown that

        r_1 + r_2 = -b/a,
    and r_1 r_2 = c/a.

Or, referring to equation (2) above, we have the following rule:

    _When the coefficient of x^2 is unity, the sum of the roots is
    the coefficient of x with the sign changed; the product of the
    roots is the independent term._

EXAMPLES:

  1. x^2 - 9x + 21 = 0.
         Sum of the roots = 9.
         Products of the roots = 21.

  2. 3x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0.
         Sum of the roots = 7/3.
         Product of the roots = -6.

  3. -21x = 17 - 4x^2.
         Sum of the roots = 21/4.
         Product of the roots = -17/4.


~II. To find the nature or character of the roots.~

  As before, r_1 = -b/2a + [[b^2 - 4ac]^(1/2)]/(2a),
             r_2 = -b/2a - [[b^2 - 4ac]^(1/2)]/(2a).

The [b^2 - 4ac]^(1/2) determines the _nature_ or _character_ of the
roots; hence it is called the _discriminant_.

~If b^2 - 4ac is positive, the roots are real, unequal, and either
rational or irrational.~

~If b^2 - 4ac is negative, the roots are imaginary and unequal.~

~If b^2 - 4ac is zero, the roots are real, equal, and rational.~

EXAMPLES:

  1. x^2 - 4x + 2 = 0.

     [b^2 - 4ac]^(1/2) = [16 - 8]^(1/2) = 8^(1/2).
     Therefore: The roots are real, unequal, and irrational.

  2. x^2 - 4x + 6 = 0.

     [b^2 - 4ac]^(1/2) = [16 - 24]^(1/2) = -8^(1/2).
     Therefore: The roots are imaginary and unequal.

  3. x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0.

     [b^2 - 4ac]^(1/2) = [16 - 16]^(1/2) = 0^(1/2).
     Therefore: The roots are real, equal, and rational.


~III. To form the quadratic equation when the roots are given.~

Suppose the roots are 3, -7.

  Then, x = 3,                       Or,      x - 3 = 0,
        x = -7.                               x + 7 = 0.
                                     -------------------
  Multiplying to get a quadratic,    (x - 3)(x + 7) = 0.

Or, x^2 + 4x - 21 = 0.

_Or_, use the sum and product idea developed on the preceding page. The
coefficient of x^2 must be unity.

Add the roots and change the sign to get the coefficient of x.

Multiply the roots to get the independent term.

Therefore: The equation is x^2 + 4x - 21 = 0.

In the same way, if the roots are [2 + 3^(1/2)]/7, [2 - 3^(1/2)]/7, the
equation is

    x^2 - (4/7)x + 1/49 = 0.


Find the sum, the product, and the nature or character of the roots of
the following:

  1. x^2 - 7x + 12 = 0.

  2. 9x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0.

  3. x^2 + 2x + 9734 = 0.

  4. 16 + 5/x = 17/(x^2).

  5. (x - 8)/(x - 3) = x.

  6. (x + 7)(x - 6) = 70.

  7. x^2 - x(2)^(1/2) = 3.

  8. pr^2 + qr + s = 0.

  9. 5, -3.

  10. 2/3, 5/3.

~Reference:~ The chapter on Ratio and Proportion in any algebra.


An easy and powerful method of proving four expressions in proportion is
illustrated by the following example:

Given a : b = c : d;

prove that 3a^3 + 5ab^2 : 3a^3 - 5ab^2 = 3c^3 + 5cd^2 : 3c^3 - 5cd^2.

Let a/b = r. Therefore a = br.

Also c/d = r. Therefore c = dr.

Substitute the value of a in the first ratio, and c in the second:

Then

  (3a^3 + 5ab^2)/(3a^3 - 5ab^2) = (3b^3r^3 + 5b^3r)/(3b^3r^3 - 5b^3r)
    = [b^3r(3r^2 + 5)]/[b^3r(3r^2 - 5)] = (3r^2 + 5)/(3r^2 - 5).

Also

  (3c^3 + 5cd^2)/(3c^3 - 5cd^2) = (3d^3r^3 + 5d^3r)/(3d^3r^3 - 5d^3r)
    = [d^3r(3r^2 + 5)]/[d^3r(3r^2 - 5)] = (3r^2 + 5)/(3r^2 - 5).

Therefore (3a^3 + 5ab^2)/(3a^3 - 5ab^2) = (3c^3 + 5cd^2)/(3c^3 - 5cd^2).

                                                                Axiom 1.

Or, 3a^3 + 5ab^2 : 3a^3 - 5ab^2 = 3c^3 + 5cd^2 : 3c^3 - 5cd^2.

If a : b = c : d, prove:

  1. a^2 + b^2 : a^2 = c^2 + d^2 : c^2.

  2. a^2 + 3b^2 : a^2 - 3b^2 = c^2 + 3d^2 : c^2 - 3d^2.

  3. a^2 + 2b^2 : 2b^2 = ac + 2bd : 2bd.

  4. 2a + 3c : 2a - 3c = 8b + 12d : 8b - 12d.

  5. a^2 - ab + b^2 : (a^3 - b^3)/a = c^2 - cd + d^2 : (c^3 - d^3)/c.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
