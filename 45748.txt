PREFACE

As a fisherman MR. PUNCH is in the best of his humours. He makes merry
over the weaknesses of those who follow the craft of Old Izaak, always
with the slyest of genial manners. The angler's habit of exaggerating
the size of his catch--his patience or his impatience when the fish
won't bite--the conscious or unconscious ridicule he has to endure from
onlookers when he is unsuccessful--the proverbial thirst that attacks
the fisherman, whether he catches anything or not--MR. PUNCH has a keen
eye for all such incidentals and presents them so jovially that nobody
laughs over them more heartily than his victims themselves do.

new, have revelled in the humours of both fishing and shooting.

He gets as much laughter out of those who handle the gun. The infinite
variety of jokes he cracks about the bad shot, the man who can't hit the
birds, or is always hitting the dogs or his companion guns, is amazing.
He does not spare the lady shooter, and jests of the peril in which the
rest of the field are placed when she is out after the birds or rabbits;
and he gets a good deal of fun out of the Frenchman's alien notion of
sport.

OBSERVATIONS ON GROUND BAIT.--Boys are often taught, though they never
learn, to regard fishing as a cruel amusement, when nevertheless
angling, at least as most commonly practised in the Thames, is
universally admitted to be particularly and pre-eminently the _gentle_
craft.

THE DUFFER WITH A SALMON-ROD

FROM "THE CONFESSIONS OF A DUFFER"

No pursuit is more sedentary, if one may talk of a sedentary pursuit,
and none more to my taste, than trout-fishing as practised in the South
of England. Given fine weather, and a good novel, nothing can be more
soothing than to sit on a convenient stump, under a willow, and watch
the placid kine standing in the water, while the brook murmurs on, and
perhaps the kingfisher flits to and fro. Here you sit and fleet the time
carelessly, till a trout rises. Then, indeed, duty demands that you
shall crawl in the manner of the serpent till you come within reach of
him, and cast a fly, which usually makes him postpone his dinner-hour.
But he will come on again, there is no need for you to change your
position, and you can always fill your basket easily--with irises and
marsh-marigolds.

Such are our country contents, but woe befall the day when I took to
salmon-fishing. The outfit is expensive, "half-crown flees" soon mount
up, especially if you never go out without losing your fly-book. If you
buy a light rod, say of fourteen feet, the chances are that it will not
cover the water, and a longer rod requires in the fisherman the strength
of a Sandow. You need wading-breeches, which come up nearly to the neck,
and weigh a couple of stone. The question has been raised, can one swim
in them, in case of an accident? For _one_, I can answer, he can't. The
reel is about the size of a butter-keg, the line measures hundreds of
yards, and the place where you fish for salmon is usually at the utter
ends of the earth. Some enthusiasts begin in February. Covered with
furs, they sit in the stern of a boat, and are pulled in a funereal
manner up and down Loch Tay, while the rods fish for themselves. The
angler's only business is to pick them up if a salmon bites, and when
this has gone on for a few days, with no bite, influenza, or a hard
frost with curling, would be rather a relief. This kind of thing is not
really angling, and a Duffer is as good at it as an expert.

Real difficulties and sufferings begin when you reach the
Cruach-na-spiel-bo, which sounds like Gaelic, and will serve us as a
name for the river. It is, of course, extremely probable that you pay a
large rent for the right to gaze at a series of red and raging floods,
or at a pale and attenuated trickle of water, murmuring peevishly
through a drought. But suppose, for the sake of argument, that the water
is "in order," and only running with deep brown swirls at some thirty
miles an hour. Suppose also, a large presumption, that the Duffer does
not leave any indispensable part of his equipment at home. He arrives at
the stream, and as he detests a gillie, whose contempt for the Duffer
breeds familiarity, he puts up his rod, selects a casting line, knots on
the kind of fly which is locally recommended, and steps into the water.
Oh, how cold it is! I begin casting at the top of the stream, and step
from a big boulder into a hole.

[Illustration]

Stagger, stumble, violent bob forwards, recovery, trip up, and here one
is in a sitting position in the bed of the stream. However, the high
india-rubber breeks have kept the water out, except about a pailful,
which gradually illustrates the equilibrium of fluids in the soles of
one's stockings. However, I am on my feet again, and walking more
gingerly, though to the spectator my movements suggest partial
intoxication. That is because the bed of the stream is full of boulders,
which one cannot see, owing to the darkness of the water. There was a
fish rose near the opposite side. My heart is in my mouth. I wade in as
far as I can, and make a tremendous swipe with the rod. A frantic tug
behind, crash, there goes the top of the rod! I am caught up in the root
of a pine-tree, high up on the bank at my back. No use in the language
of imprecation. I waddle out, climb the bank, extricate the fly, get out
a spare top, and to work again, more cautiously. Something wrong, the
hook has caught in my coat, between my shoulders. I must get the coat
off somehow, not an easy thing to do, on account of my india-rubber
armour. It is off at last. I cut the hook out with a knife, making a big
hole in the coat, and cast again. That was over him! I let the fly
float down, working it scientifically. No response. Perhaps better look
at the fly. Just my luck, I have cracked it off!

Where is the fly-book? Where indeed? A feverish search for the fly-book
follows--no use: it is not in the basket, it is not in my pocket; must
have fallen out when I fell into the river. No good in looking for it,
the water is too thick, I _thought_ I heard a splash. Luckily there are
some flies in my cap, it looks knowing to have some flies in one's cap,
and it is not so easy to lose a cap without noticing it, as to lose most
things. Here is a big Silver Doctor that may do as the water is thick. I
put one on, and begin again casting over where that fish rose. By
George, there he came at me, at least I think it must have been at me, a
great dark swirl, "the purple wave bowed over it like a hill," but he
never touched me. Give him five minutes law, the hook is sure to be well
fastened on, need not bother looking at that again. Five minutes take a
long time in passing, when you are giving a salmon a rest. Good times
and bad times and all times pass, so here goes. It is correct to begin a
good way above him and come down to him. I'm past him; no, there is a
long heavy drag under water, I get the point up, he is off like a shot,
while I stand in a rather stupid attitude, holding on. If I cannot get
out and run down the bank, he has me at his mercy. I do stagger out,
somehow, falling on my back, but keeping the point up with my right
hand. No bones broken, but surely he is gone! I begin reeling up the
line, with a heavy heart, and try to lift it out of the water. It won't
come, he is here still, he has only doubled back. Hooray! Nothing so
nice as being all alone when you hook a salmon. No gillie to scream out
contradictory orders. He is taking it very easy, but suddenly he moves
out a few yards, and begins jiggering, that is, giving a series of short
heavy tugs. They say he is never well hooked, when he jiggers. The rod
thrills unpleasantly in my hands, I wish he wouldn't do that. It is very
disagreeable and makes me very nervous. Hullo! he is off again
up-stream, the reel ringing like mad: he gets into the thin water at the
top, and jumps high in the air. He is a monster. Hullo! what's that
splash? The reel has fallen off, it was always loose, and has got into
the water. How am I to act now? He is coming back like mad, and all the
line is loose, and I can't reel up. I begin pulling at the line to bring
up the reel, but the reel only lets the line out, and now he's off
again, down stream this time, and I after him, and the line running out
at both ends at once, and now my legs get entangled in it, it is twisted
all round me. He runs again and jumps, the line comes back in my face,
all slack, something has given. It is the hook, it was not knotted on
firmly to start with. He flings himself out of the water once more to be
sure that he is free, and I sit down and gnaw the reel. Had ever anybody
such bad fortune? But it is just my luck!

I go back to the place where the reel fell in, and by pulling cautiously
I extract it from the stream. It shan't come off again; I tie it on with
the leather lace of one of my brogues. Then I reel up the slack, and put
on another fly, out of my cap--a Popham. Then I fish down the rest of
the pool. Near the edge, in the slower part of the water, there is a
long slow draw; before I can lift the point of the rod, a salmon jumps
high out of the water at me,--and is gone! I never struck him, was too
much taken aback at the moment; did not expect him then. Thank goodness,
the hook is not off this time.

The next stream is very deep, strong and narrow; the best chance is
close in on my side. By Jove! here he is, he took almost beside the
rock. He sails leisurely out into the strength of the stream; if he will
come up, I can manage him, but if he goes down, the water is very swift
and broken, there are big boulders, and then a sheer wall of rock
difficult to pass in cold blood, and then the Big Pool. He insists on
going down; I hold hard on him, and refuse line. But he leaps, and
then--well he _will_ have it; down he rushes, I after him, over the
stones, scrambling along the rocky face; great heavens! _the top joint
of the rod is loose_; I did not tie it on, thought it would hold well
enough. But down it runs, right down the line; it must be touching the
fish. It is; he does not like it, he jiggers like a mad thing, rushes
across the Big Pool, nearly on to the opposite bank. Why won't the line
run? The line is entangled in my bootlace. He is careering about; I feel
that I am trembling like a leaf. There, I knew it would happen; he is
off with my last casting-line, hook and all. A beauty he was, clear as
silver and fresh from the sea. Well, there is nothing for it but a walk
back to the house. I have lost one fly-book, two hooks, a couple of
casting-lines, three salmon, a top joint, and I have torn a great hole
in my coat. On changing my dress before lunch, I find my fly-book in my
breast pocket, where I had not thought of looking for it somehow. Then
the rain comes, and there is not another fishing day in my fortnight.
Still, it decidedly was "one crowded hour of glorious life," while it
lasted. The other men caught four or five salmon apiece; it is their red
letter day. It is marked in black in my calendar.

To WELL-INFORMED PISCATORIALS.--_Query._ What sort of fish is a Nod?

_Note._ A Nod is a sea-fish, and is, probably, of the limpet tribe. This
we gather from our knowledge of the Periwinkle, known in polite circles
as the 'Wink. The value of the Nod has come down to us in the form of an
old proverb, "A Nod is as good as a 'Wink," and this no doubt originated
the query to which we have satisfactorily replied.

    Is there any fly can rise him,
      Any hook can hold him tight?
    Is one able to surprise him
      Any time from morn to night?

    Stranger, years I've passed in trying
      Every artifice and lure,
    Standing, crawling, wading, lying,
      Casting clean and long and sure.
    Empty yet remains my basket,
      Cramped and weary grows my fist,
    Stranger, in despair I ask it,
      Does the trout in truth exist?

THE GENTLE CRAFT

(_By Our Own Trout_)

    How gentle is the fisherman who sits beside the brook,
    And firmly puts the wriggling worm upon the pointed hook
    How pleasant for the hapless trout to find, from some strange cause,
    The fly conceals a something that makes havoc with its jaws!

    Dame Juliana Berners wrote a book, in which she said
    The blessing of St. Peter rests upon the angler's head;
    She bid him not be "ravenous in taking game,"--I wish
    She'd ever asked if he deserved the blessings of the fish.

    We were a happy family, as merry as could be,
    "Diversified with crimson stains," as Pope has said. Ah me!
    There came the cruel fisherman, his flies had deadly gleam,
    And not a soul remains but me to mourn within the stream.

    What recked my little troutlets of the Palmers, Spinners, Duns,
    They headlong rushed, and then got caught, my innocent young sons!
    They're cooked--excuse an old trout's tear!--but hard it is to feel
    A monster's ta'en your family for matutinal meal.

    The "honest angler," Walton, cried, and maundered night and day,
    But Byron puts the matter in a very different way;
    He said that Isaac should have hook fixed firmly "in his gullet,"
    And oh! that I might be the trout that he suggests should pull it.

THE COMPLEAT DUFFER

[Illustration: Hooking a lobster]

        I have fished in every way,
          Fished on every kind of day,
    But my basket still remains _in statu quo_,
          Not a stickleback will rise,
          Not a gudgeon as a prize
          To the quite amazing flies
                That I throw.

          When I try the purling brook
          Many trout just have a look
    At my fly, or at the minnow that I spin,
          With fishy leer they squirm
          Off, and my belief is firm
          That I'd better use a worm
                On a pin.

          Wherever I get leave,
          Still I fish from morn to eve,
    Though I never--hardly ever--rightly cast,
          With a body soaking wet,
          With a mind intent and set
          On success achieving yet
                At the last.

          In my coat of wondrous tweed,
          And on every wandering weed,
    Hooks and flies unnamed invariably I fix.
          _Here_ I cannot land a fish--
          I can only hope and wish
          I may creel a goodly dish
                In the Styx.

THE LAY OF A SUCCESSFUL ANGLER

    The dainty artificial fly
      Designed to catch the wily trout,
    Full loud _laudabunt alii_,
      And I will join, at times, no doubt,
    But yet my praise, without pretence,
    Is not from great experience.

    I talk as well as anyone
      About the different kinds of tackle,
    I praise the Gnat, the Olive Dun,
      Discuss the worth of wings and hackle
    I've flies myself of each design,
    No book is better filled than mine.

    But when I reach the river's side
      Alone, for none of these I wish,
    No victim to a foolish pride,
      My object is to capture fish;
    Let me confess, then, since you ask it--
    A worm it is which fills my basket!

    O brown, unlovely, wriggling worm,
      On which with scorn the haughty look,
    It is thy fascinating squirm
      Which brings the fattest trout to book,
    From thee unable to refrain,
    Though flies are cast for him in vain!

    Deep gratitude to thee I feel,
      And then, perhaps, it's chiefly keen,
    When rival anglers view my creel,
      And straightway turn a jealous green;
    And, should they ask me--"What's your fly?"
    "A fancy pattern," I reply!

A SPORTIVE SONG

_A Sojourner in North Britain goes Salmon-fishing with a New Young
Woman._

    Far from the busy haunts of men,
      Mid hazel, heather, gorse,
    You are the Beauty of the glen,
      And I the Beast, of course.
    I fetch and carry at your wish,
      I wait your beck and nod,
    And yet your soul is with that fish,
      Your ardour in your rod.

    He struggles hard, gives now a lunge,
      Like boxer in the ring,
    And now he executes a plunge
      That makes your tackle spring;
    And then again he quiet lies,
      As if in cunning thought
    Of how to lose this worst of flies
      That he so gladly caught.

    Anon we see his silver back
      Rush madly up the stream,
    And then he takes another tack,
      An effort that's supreme;
    He tries to leap the rocky wall
      That environs the pool.

    And now you give a little laugh
      That means "He must give way!"
    "Look out!" you cry. I do look out,
      And then I lose my head.
    You've missed the fish without a doubt,
      But captured me instead!

THE BIRDS AND THE PHEASANT

(_After Longfellow_)

    I shot a partridge in the air,
    It fell in turnips, "Don" knew where;
    For just as it dropped, with my right
    I stopped another in its flight.

    I killed a pheasant in the copse,
    It fell amongst the fir-tree tops;
    For though a pheasant's flight is strong,
    A cock, hard hit, cannot fly long.

    Soon, soon afterwards, in a pie,
    I found the birds in jelly lie;
    And the pheasant, at a fortnight's end,
    I found again in the _carte_ of a friend.

ODE ON A DISTANT PARTRIDGE

(_By an Absent-minded Sportsman_)

    Well, I'm blest! I'm pretty nearly
      Speechless, as I watch that bird,
    Saving that I mutter merely
      One concise, emphatic word--
      What that is may be inferred!

    English prose is, to my sorrow,
      Insufficient for the task.
    Would that I could freely borrow
      Expletives from Welsh or Basque--
      One or two is all I ask!

    Failing that, let so-called verses
      Serve to mitigate my grief
    Doggerel now and then disperses
      Agonies that need relief.
      (Missing birds of these is chief!)

    Blankly tramping o'er the stubbles
      Is a bore, to put it mild;
    But, in short, to crown my troubles,
      _One_ mishap has made me riled,
      Driv'n me, like the coveys, wild.

    For at last I flush a partridge,
      Ten yards rise, an easy pot!
    Click. Why, bless me, where's the cartridge?
      Hang it! there, I clean forgot
      Putting _them_ in ere I shot!

THE FOOL WITH A GUN

(_To the Tune of the "Temptation of St. Anthony"_)

[Illustration: A LITTLE CHECK]

    There are many fools that worry this world,
      Fools old, and fools who're young;
    Fools with fortunes, and fools without,
    Fools who dogmatise, fools who doubt,
    Fools who snigger, and fools who shout,
    Fools who never know what they're about,
      And fools all cheek and tongue;
    Fools who're gentlemen, fools who're cads,
    Fools who're greybeards, and fools who're lads;
    Fools with manias, fools with fads,
    Fools with cameras, fools with tracts,
    Fools who deny the stubbornest facts,
    Fools in theories, fools in acts;
      Fools who write Theosophist books,
      Fools who believe in Mahatmas and spooks;
    Fools who prophesy--races and Tophets--
    Bigger fools who believe in prophets;
    Fools who quarrel, and fools who quack;
    In fact, there are all sorts of fools in the pack,
      Fools fat, thin, short, and tall;
    But of all sorts of fools, the fool with a gun
    (Who points it at someone--of course, "in fun"--
    And fools around till chance murder is done)
      Is the worsest fool of them all!

THE FIRST OF SEPTEMBER

    The First of September, remember
      The day of supremest delight.
    Get ready the cartridge, the partridge
      Must fall in the stubble ere night.

    The breechloader's ready, and steady
      The dog that we taught in old days;
    He's firm to his duty, a beauty
      That cares for but one person's praise.

    He's careful in stubble, no trouble
      In turnips, he's keen as a man;
    But looks on acutely, and mutely
      Seems saying, "Shoot well, if you can!"

    They flash from the cover--what lover
      Of sport does not thrill as they rise
    In feathered apparel? Each barrel
      Kills one, as the swift covey flies.

    So on through the morning, still scorning
      All rest until midday has past,
    When lunch should be present, and pleasant
      That _al fresco_ breaking of fast.

    One pipe, then be doing, pursuing
      The sport that no sport can eclipse;
    So homeward to dinner, a winner
      Of praise from the fairest of lips.

THE ANATOMY OF SHOOTING

MEN WE NEVER MEET

1. The man who makes no excuses for shooting badly; such as--1. The
light was in his eyes; 2. He was bilious; 3. There was something wrong
with his cartridges; 4. Too many cigars the night before; 5. Some
particular eatable or drinkable taken the night before; 6. Or that
morning; 7. He was afraid of hitting that beater; 8. We were walking too
fast; 9. He hadn't got his eye in; 10. Or his eye was out; 11. He didn't
think it was his bird; 12. It was too far off; 13. He always thought
there was something the matter with _that_ gun.

2. The man whose dog hasn't a good nose.

3. The man who can't "shoot a bit sometimes."

4. The man who hasn't some particular theory as to--1. The very best
gun; 2. Cartridges; 3. Charges of powder and shot; 4. Best tipple to
shoot on; 5. Best sort of boots; 6. Gaiters; 7. And equipment generally.

5. The man who doesn't change the said theory every season.

6. The man who hasn't sometimes said he couldn't shoot after lunch.

7. Or that he could shoot better after lunch.

8. The man who on your remarking that your friend George Lake is a good
shot, doesn't answer that you should see Billy Mountain (or someone
else) and then you would know what shooting really was.

9. The man who hasn't a friend who "can't hit a haystack."

10. The friend who owns it.

11. The man who doesn't like to be considered a good shot.

12. The man who, being a bad shot, doesn't comfort himself by thinking
he knows a worse.

13. The man who hasn't made a longer shot than anyone in the company.

14. The man who, having made it, doesn't tell the story.

15. And who, having told the story, doesn't tell it more than once.

Finally, _Mr. Punch_ is never likely to meet the man who, having read
the above, will not own that it is strictly true of those who pursue the
pleasant pastime of shooting when, as the eminent Burton puts it, "they
have leisure from public cares and business."

LOVE AMONG THE PARTRIDGES

    September's first, the day was fair,
      We sought the pleasant stubble,
    The birds were rising everywhere,
      The old dog gave no trouble.
    And still my friend missed every shot,
      While I ne'er fired in vain.
    I said, "Perchance the day's too hot?"
      He cried, "Amelia Jane!"

    We shot throughout the livelong day,
      We always shoot together,
    And yet in a disgraceful way,
      He never touched a feather.
    I said, "How is it that you muff
      Your birds, my boy? Explain."
    He sighed and said, "I know it's rough
      But, oh, Amelia Jane!"

    Quoth I, "Amelia Jane may be
      As plump as any partridge,
    But that's no reason I can see
      Why you should waste each cartridge."
    He shot the dog, then missed my head,
      But caused the keeper pain;

THE GROUSE THAT JACK SHOT

     This is the Grouse that _Jack_ shot.

     This the friend who expected the Grouse that _Jack_ shot.

     This is the label addressed to the friend who expected the Grouse
     that _Jack_ shot.

     This is the porter who "found" the "birds" in the Babel where lost
     was the label, &c.

     This is the dame with the crumpled hat, wife of the porter who
     "found" the "birds," &c.

     This is the cooking-wench florid and fat of the dame with the
     crumpled hat, &c.

     This is the table where diners sat, served by the cooking-maid
     florid and fat of the dame with the crumpled hat, &c.

     This is the _gourmand_ all forlorn, who dreamed of the table where
     diners sat, served by the cooking-wench florid and fat, &c.

     This is the postman who knocked in the morn awaking the _gourmand_
     all forlorn from his dream of the table, &c.

     And this is _Jack_ (with a face of scorn), thinking in wrath of
     "directions" torn from the parcel by railway borne, announced by
     the postman who knocked in the morn, awaking the _gourmand_ all
     forlorn, who dreamed of the table where diners sat, served by the

    If in the Shooting Season you some brace of birds would send
    (As per letter duly posted) to a fond expectant friend,
    Pray remember that a railway is the genuine modern Babel,

ON A DANGEROUS SHOT

(_By Mr. Punch's Vagrant_)

    He seemed an inoffensive man
      When first I saw him on the stubble;
    Made on the self-same sporting plan
      As those who shoot with ease or trouble!
    The average men, in fact, whose skill
      (A thing of luck far more than habit)
    Tempts them at times to go and kill
      The hare, the partridge and the rabbit.

    He rushed not and he did not lag;
      He kept the line when we were walking.
    He had a useful cartridge-bag;
      And was not prone to useless talking.
    He smoked an ordinary pipe;
      His guns were hammerless ejectors;
    He wore a fairly common type
      Of patent pig-skin leg-protectors.

    He told a story now and then,
      Some ancient tale of fur or feather,
    That sportsmen love to smile at when
      On Autumn days they come together.
    In fact, he seemed to outward view
      In all his gunned and gaitered glory,
    Just such a man as I or you,
      Except--but that's another story.

    Except (I'll tell it) when he shot:
      Then, then he did not care a cuss, sir;
    He blazed as if he hadn't got
      The least regard for life or us, sir.
    Our terrors left him unafraid;
      He tried for full-grown birds and cheepers,
    And, missing these, he all but made
      A record bag of guns and keepers.

THE "CHEEP" OF THE PARTRIDGE

_Perdix Cinerea loquitur_

    'Tis the voice of the sportsman. I hear him complain,
    "All my hopes of big bags have been damped by the rain.
    With birds shy and scarce, flooded furze and no stubble,
    To beat dripping covers is scarce worth the trouble."
    Aha! The wind's ill that blows nobody good,
    True, the wet has proved fatal to many a brood,
    Parent birds have made moan over eggs swamped and addled,
    When our covers were lakes in which ducks might have paddled,
    But partridges drowned when they'd scarce chipped the shell,
    Yet,--yes, on the whole, 'tis perhaps just as well.
    Water! Better than fire; and a cold in the head
    Is not _quite_ so bad as a dose of cold lead.
    Prime time for swell vassals of powder and shot!
    What's September to them, without plenty to pot?
    Oh! won't they fume, as they look out this morn
    On these damp furzy swamps, and yon drenched standing corn?
    Poor grumbling gun-maniacs! Isn't it fun?
    In the game "Birds _v._ Barrels" we birds will score one
    Just for once, I should hope. In this beautiful bog
    I am safe, I should fancy, from man, gun, and dog.
    They may bag a few birds on the skirts of the wheat,
    But I don't think _this_ cover will pay 'em to beat.
    St. Partridge be bothered! St. Swithin's _my_ Saint,
    May his rainy rain last, _I_ shall make no complaint.
    No! Farmers and sportsmen may grumble together--
    For my part, I rather approve of the weather.

BALLAD OF THE CUNNING PARTRIDGE

    The partridge is a cunning bird,
      He likes not those who bring him down:
    From age to age he has preferred
      The shots that blaze into the brown,
    Whose stocks come never shoulder high,
      Who never pause to pick and choose,
    But on whose biceps you descry
      The black, the blue, the tell-tale bruise.

    Or should a stubborn cartridge swell,
      And jam, as it may chance, your gun,
    The sly old partridge knows it well,
      "Great Scott!" he seems to chirp "here's fun!"
    He gathers all his feathered tribe,
      They leave the stubble or the grass,
    And with one wild and whirling gibe
      Above your silent muzzles pass.

    Your scheme you carefully contrive,
      And, while each beater waves his flag,
    Your fancy, as they duly drive,
      Already sees a record bag.
    But lo! they baulk your keen desire,
      For, though with birds the sky grows black,
    Not one of them will face the fire,
      And every blessed bird goes back.

    For partridges I'll try no more;
      Why should I waste in grim despair?
    Take me to far Albania's shore,
      And let me bag the woodcock there.
    Or on the Susquehanna's stream
      I'll shoot with every chance of luck
    The gourmet's glory and his dream,
      The canvas-back, that juicy duck.

    Yea, any other bird I'll shoot,
      But not again with toil and pain
    I'll tramp the stubble or the root.
      Nor wait behind a fence in vain.
    For of all birds you hit or miss
      (I've tried it out by every test),
    Again I say with emphasis
      The partridge is the cunningest.

HOW MOSSOO SHOT THE COCK-PHEASANT

(_The Gamekeeper's Story_)

[Illustration]

    He were a sort o' Frenchman, sir,
      And called hisself a Duck:
    I never could make head or tail
      O' that there furrin muck!
    He came to stay wi' Master there.
      And brought his guns and that--
    But bless you, sir! he could na' shoot,
      No more than this here hat!

[Illustration]

    The Master and the Frenchman went
      To shoot the spinney-kivver
    What reaches from the stable-wall
      Right down to that there river.
    A rocketing cock flew up at wunst,
      And Mossoo he fired, and missed--
    How he did swear, and tear his hair,
      And shake his little fist!

    The way that Mossoo danced about,
      It really were a sight!
    He'd grin, and pull his beard, and shout
      And screech with all his might.
    He wore a thing across his nose
      Just like a kind o' shear:
    I think he said he were "my hop"--
      Which means his sight were near.

    Mossoo he yelled, "I see him zere,
      Upon ze stable top!"
    With that he banged off right and left--
      I seed a summat drop;
    I ran to pick up that there bird;
      And 'neath the stable-clock
    I found it sure enow--it were
      Our new gilt weather-cock!

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
