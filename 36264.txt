PREFACE


It is now just thirty years since one day his young assistant
suggested to Dr. John A. Broadus that he prepare a harmony of the
Gospels that should depart from the old plan of following the feasts
as the turning points in the life of Jesus. He acted on the hint and
led the way that all modern harmonies have followed. The book has gone
through a dozen large editions and has become the standard harmony for
many thousands of students all over the world. Broadus was concerned
to bring out "the inner movements of the history, towards that
long-delayed, but foreseen and inevitable collision, in which, beyond
all other instances, the wrath of man was made to praise God." This he
succeeded in doing with marvelous power.

A generation has passed by and it is meet that the work of Broadus
should be reviewed in the light of modern synoptic criticism and
research into every phase of the life of Christ. So I have made a new
analysis that preserves Broadus's real purpose, but with new sections
and new notes. The notes at the end of the old volume, written by me
for the first edition, have been thoroughly revised and brought up to
date. The Old Testament passages referred to in the Gospels are given
in the text. The Gospel of Mark appears in the first column, then
Matthew, Luke, and John. It is now known that Matthew and Luke made
use of Mark for the framework of their Gospels. This change simplifies
amazingly the unfolding of the narrative.

There is still dispute concerning the historical worth of the Gospel
of John, but the Johannine authorship is not disproved. It still holds
the field in my opinion. Dr. C. F. Burney's theory of an Aramaic
original is already giving a new turn to Johannine criticism.

A harmony of the Gospels cannot meet every phase of modern criticism.
The data are given, as free from bias as circumstances allow, so that
all students can use the book and interpret the facts according to
their various theories. Numerous historical items call for notes of
various kinds that throw light on the passage in question. No effort
is made to reconcile all the divergent statements of various details
in the different Gospels. The differences challenge the student's
interest as much as the correspondences and are natural marks of
individual work. The notes and appendices at the end of the volume are
meant for students who wish help for historical study of the life of
Christ. A harmony cannot give all the aid that one needs, but it is
the one essential book for the serious study of the life of Jesus.
Students in colleges, theological seminaries, Young Men's Christian
Association and Young Women's Christian Association classes, Sunday
School teachers and pupils, preachers, all who read the Gospels
intelligently must have a modern harmony of the Gospels. One who has
never read a harmony will be amazed at the flood of light that flashes
from the parallel and progressive records of the life of Jesus Christ.

Broadus began teaching the life of Jesus in 1859 and kept it up till
his death in 1895. I began like work in 1888 and have kept on without
a break till now. I count it one of the crowning mercies of my life
that I have led so many successive classes of young ministers and
young women (some five thousand in all) through the study of Christ's
life. If only one can pass on to others in all their freshness and
power the teachings of Jesus, he cannot fail. There was a time when
men hung in wonder upon the words of Jesus, listening with awe and
rapture as he spoke. The Figure of Christ fills the world today as
never before. Back to Christ the world has come, the Christ of Faith
and of Experience, the Jesus of History, the Man of Galilee, the Hope
of Today, the Jesus Christ of the Four Gospels, in the full blaze of
modern critical and historical study.

A HARMONY OF THE GOSPELS FOR STUDENTS OF THE LIFE OF CHRIST




PART I

THE SOURCES OF THE GOSPELS


Sect. 1. IN THE DEDICATION LUKE EXPLAINS HIS METHOD OF RESEARCH[a]


  Luke 1:1-4

   1   Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to draw up a narrative
     concerning those matters which have been [1]fulfilled among us,
   2 even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were
   3 eyewitnesses and ministers of the word, it seemed good to me also,
     having traced the course of all things accurately from the first,
   4 to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus;[b] that
     thou mightest know the certainty concerning the [2]things
     [3]wherein thou wast instructed.

     [Footnote 1: Or, _fully establish_.]

     [Footnote 2: Gr. _words_.]

     [Footnote 3: Or, _which thou wast taught by word of mouth_.]

[Footnote a: Luke is the first critic of the life of Christ whose
criticism has been preserved to us. Others had drawn up narratives of
certain portions of Christ's work. Others still had been eyewitnesses of
the ministry of Jesus and gave Luke their oral testimony. Luke sifted it
all with care and produced an orderly and reasonably full narrative of
the earthly ministry of Jesus. We cannot reproduce all the sources that
Luke had at his command, but it is clear that he followed in the main our
Gospel of Mark, as any one can see for himself by comparing the two
Gospels in this Harmony. Both Matthew and Luke made use of Mark. But they
had other sources also. See note 2 on Synoptic Criticism at the close of
the Harmony. See also Chapter IV, "Luke's Method of Research" in my _Luke
the Historian in the Light of Research_.]

[Footnote b: Luke alone follows the method of ancient historians in
dedicating his Gospel, as also the Acts (1:1), to a patron who probably
met the expense of publication. So Luke as a Gentile Christian writes an
historical introduction in literary (_Koine_) Greek after the fashion of
Thucydides and Plutarch. Mark had no formal introduction. Matthew's
introduction is genealogical because he is writing for Jewish readers to
prove that Jesus is the Messiah of Jewish hope. John, writing last of
all, has a theological introduction to meet the Gnostic and philosophical
misconceptions concerning the Person of Christ. Thus he pictures Christ
as the Eternal Logos, with God in his pre-incarnate state, who became
flesh and thus revealed the Father to men.]




PART II

THE PRE-EXISTENT STATE OF CHRIST AND HIS INCARNATION


Sect. 2. IN HIS INTRODUCTION JOHN PICTURES CHRIST AS THE WORD (LOGOS)


  John 1:1-18

   1   In the beginning was the Word,[a] and the Word was with God, and
   2 the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All
   3 things were made [1]by him; and without him [2]was not anything
   4 made that hath been made. In him was life; and the life was the
   5 light of men. And the light shineth in the darkness; and the
   6 darkness [3]apprehended it not. There came a man, sent from God,
   7 whose name was John. The same came for witness, that he might bear
   8 witness of the light, that all might believe through him. He was
     not the light, but _came_ that he might bear witness of the light.
   9 [4]There was the true light, _even the light_ which lighteth
  10 [5]every man, coming into the world. He was in the world, and the
  11 world was made [1]by him, and the world knew him not. He came unto
  12 [6]his own, and they that were his own received him not. But as
     many as received him, to them gave he the right to become children
  13 of God, _even_ to them that believe on his name: which were
     [7]born, not of [8]blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the
  14 will of man, but of God. And the Word[a] became flesh, and [9]dwelt
     among us (and we beheld his glory, glory as of [10]the only
  15 begotten from the Father), full of grace and truth. John beareth
     witness of him, and crieth, saying, [11]This was he of whom I said,
     He that cometh after me is become before me: for he was [12]before
  16 me. For of his fulness we all received, and grace for grace. For
  17 the law was given [1]by Moses; grace and truth came [1]by Jesus
  18 Christ. No man hath seen God at any time; [13]the only begotten
     Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared _him_.

[Footnote a: The Fourth Gospel makes no further use of the term Logos
(Word) for Christ. No other Gospel employs the term, but in 1 John 1:1 we
find "the Word of life" in this sense and in Rev. 19:14 we have: "and his
name is called the Word of God." The Greek word has a double sense
(reason and speech) and John seems to have both ideas in mind (1:18).
Christ is the Idea of God and the Expression of God. The Stoics followed
Plato in the philosophical use of Logos. Philo took it up and made it
familiar to Jewish readers who were already used to the Hebrew _Memra_
(Word) in a personal sense. But John carried the term further than any of
his predecessors and placed it on a par with Messiah, Son of God, Son of
Man, and other phrases that portray aspects of the Person of Christ. John
writes his Gospel to prove the deity of Jesus (John 20:31) against
Gnostics (Cerinthian) who denied it, as he wrote his First Epistle (1
John 1:1-4) to prove the humanity of Jesus against Docetic Gnostics who
disclaimed it. See note 3 at end of Harmony.]

[Footnote b: The Sinaitic Syriac, against all the early Greek
manuscripts, reads in Matt. 1:16: "But Joseph, to whom the Virgin Mary
was betrothed, begat Jesus." This ancient Ebionitic text is followed by
Von Soden in his _Griechisches Neues Testament_ and by Moffatt in his
_New Translation of the New Testament_, but it is difficult to believe it
genuine, for in Matt. 1:18-22 the writer pictures Joseph as on the point
of putting Mary away privily. The two reports in the Sinaitic Syriac
flatly contradict each other. Those who accept it say that the writer of
the Virgin Birth view in 1:18-20 overlooked 1:16 (certainly a serious
oversight). It is easier to think that an Ebionitic scribe in copying
altered 1:16, but passed by 1:18-20. The Ebionites denied the deity of
Jesus. Both Matthew and Luke (1:26-38) give the Virgin Birth of Jesus,
but they preserve separate traditions on the subject.]

represent three great periods in the history of Israel. See note 5 at end

Matthew and in Luke.]




PART IV

THE BIRTH AND CHILDHOOD OF THE BAPTIST AND OF JESUS

Probably B.C. 7 to A.D. 7

_Sects. 4-19. These sections include the annunciations, the birth,
infancy, and childhood of both John and Jesus._


Sect. 4. THE ANNUNCIATION[a] OF THE BIRTH OF THE BAPTIST TO ZACHARIAS

Jerusalem, in the Temple. Probably B.C. 7


  Luke 1:5-25[b]

   5   There was in the days of Herod, king of Judea, a certain priest
     named Zacharias, of the course of Abijah: and he had a wife of the
   6 daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth. And they were both
     righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and
   7 ordinances of the Lord blameless. And they had no child, because
     that Elisabeth was barren, and they both were _now_ [1]well
     stricken in years.
   8   Now it came to pass, while he executed the priest's office before
   9 God in the order of his course, according to the custom of the
     priest's office, his lot was to enter into the [2]temple of the
  10 Lord and burn incense. And the whole multitude of the people were
  11 praying without at the hour of incense. And there appeared unto
     him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar
  12 of incense. And Zacharias was troubled when he saw _him_, and fear
  13 fell upon him. But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias:
     because thy supplication is heard, and thy wife Elisabeth shall
  14 bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John. And thou shalt
  15 have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth. For he
     shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and he shall drink no
     wine nor [3]strong drink [_see Num. 6:3; Judg. 13:4-6; 1 Sam.
     1:11_]; and he shall be filled with the [4]Holy Ghost, even from
  16 his mother's womb. And many of the children of Israel shall he
  17 turn unto the Lord their God. And he shall [5]go before his face
     in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the
     fathers to the children [_see Mal. 3:1; 4:5-6_], and the
     disobedient _to walk_ in the wisdom of the just; to make ready for
  18 the Lord a people prepared _for him_. And Zacharias said unto the
     angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife
  19 [6]well stricken in years. And the angel answering said unto him,
     I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God [_see Dan. 8:16;
     9:21_]; and I was sent to speak unto thee, and to bring thee these
  20 good tidings. And behold, thou shalt be silent and not able to
     speak, until the day that these things shall come to pass, because
     thou believedst not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their
  21 season. And the people were waiting for Zacharias, and they
  22 marvelled [7]while he tarried in the [2]temple. And when he came
     out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had
     seen a vision in the [2]temple: and he continued making signs unto
  23 them, and remained dumb. And it came to pass, when the days of his
     ministration were fulfilled, he departed unto his house.
  24   And after these days Elisabeth his wife conceived; and she hid
  25 herself five months, saying, Thus hath the Lord done unto me in
     the days wherein he looked upon _me_, to take away my reproach
     among men.

     [Footnote 1: Gr. _advanced in their days_.]

     [Footnote 2: Or, _sanctuary_.]

     [Footnote 3: Gr. _sikera_.]

     [Footnote 4: Or, _Holy Spirit_: and so throughout all the
     Gospels.]

     [Footnote 5: Some ancient authorities read _come nigh before his
     face_.]

     [Footnote 6: Gr. _advanced in her days_.]

     [Footnote 7: Or, _at his tarrying_.]

[Footnote a: There are three annunciations: (1) to Zacharias Sect. 4, (2)
to Mary Sect. 5, (3) to Joseph Sect. 9. Luke gives the first two and
Matthew the third. The Angel Gabriel is named by Luke (1:19, 26), but
Matthew simply has "an angel of the Lord" (1:20).]

[Footnote b: It is certain that Luke tells the infancy stories from the
standpoint of Mary while Matthew writes from the standpoint of Joseph.
Matthew gives the public account while Luke tells the private story from
Mary herself (Ramsay, _Was Christ Born at Bethlehem?_ p. 79). Luke could
have seen Mary, if still alive, or could have obtained it from one of
Mary's circle either orally or in manuscript form. Some scholars even
suggest "Gospel of Mary" and even, "Gospel of the Baptist" as a written
source for Luke in 1:5-2:52. Sanday (_The Life of Christ in Recent
Research_, p. 166) says: "These two chapters--whatever the date at which
they were first committed to writing--are essentially the most archaic
thing in the whole New Testament." Certainly Luke reveals the use of
Aramaic or Hebrew sources by the sudden changes in his style from 1:1-4.
Luke, if familiar with the current account as seen in Matthew, apparently
felt that he owed it to Mary to record her story of her great
experience.]




Sect. 5. THE ANNUNCIATION TO THE VIRGIN MARY OF THE BIRTH OF JESUS

Nazareth. Probably B.C. 7 or 6


  Luke 1:26-38

  26   Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a
  27 city of Galilee, named Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man
     whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's
  28 name was Mary. And he came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that
  29 art [1]highly favoured, the Lord _is_ with thee.[2] But she was
     greatly troubled at the saying, and cast in her mind what manner
  30 of salutation this might be. And the angel said unto her, Fear
  31 not, Mary: for thou hast found [3]favour with God. And behold,
     thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt
  32 call his name JESUS [_see Isa. 7:14_]. He shall be great, and
     shall be called the Son of the Most High: and the Lord God shall
     give unto him the throne of his father David [_see 2 Sam.
  33 7:12-17_]: and he shall reign over the house of Jacob [4]for ever;
  34 and of his kingdom there shall be no end. And Mary said unto the
  35 angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man? And the angel
     answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee,
     and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee: wherefore
     also [5]that which [6]is to be born [7]shall be called holy [_see
  36 Ex. 13:12_], the Son of God. And behold, Elisabeth thy kinswoman,
     she also hath conceived a son in her old age: and this is the
  37 sixth month with her that [8]was called barren. For no word from
  38 God shall be void of power [_see Gen. 18:14_]. And Mary said,
     Behold, the [9]handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to
     thy word. And the angel departed from her.

     [Footnote 1: Or, _endued with grace_.]

     [Footnote 2: Many ancient authorities add _blessed_ art _thou among
     women_. (See ver. 42.)]

     [Footnote 3: Or, _grace_.]

     [Footnote 4: Gr. _unto the ages_.]

     [Footnote 5: Or, _the holy thing which is to be born shall be

Sect. 6. THE SONG[a] OF ELISABETH TO MARY UPON HER VISIT

Hill Country of Judea


  Luke 1:39-45

  39   And Mary arose in these days and went into the hill country with
  40 haste, into a city of Judah; and entered into the house of
  41 Zacharias and saluted Elisabeth. And it came to pass, when
     Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her
  42 womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost; and she lifted
     up her voice with a loud cry, and said, Blessed _art_ thou among
  43 women, and blessed _is_ the fruit of thy womb. And whence is this
  44 to me, that the mother of my Lord should come unto me? For behold,
     when the voice of thy salutation came into mine ears, the babe
  45 leaped in my womb for joy. And blessed _is_ she that [1]believed;
     for there shall be a fulfilment of the things which have been
     spoken to her from the Lord.

     [Footnote 1: Or, _believed that there shall be_.]

[Footnote a: This hymn or psalm springs from the omen to Elisabeth.]




Sect. 7. THE MAGNIFICAT OF MARY

Hill Country of Judea


  Luke 1:46-56

  46                                       And Mary said,
       My soul doth magnify the Lord [_see 1 Sam. 2:1-10_],
  47   And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.
  48   For he hath looked upon the low estate of his [1]handmaiden:
       For behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me
         blessed [_see 1 Sam 1:11_].
  49   For he that is mighty hath done to me great things;
       And holy is his name [_see 1 Sam. 2:2_].
  50   And his mercy is unto generations and generations
       On them that fear him [_see Ps. 103:17_].
  51   He hath shewed strength with his arm;
       He hath scattered the proud [2]in the imagination of their heart
         [_see 1 Sam. 2:4; Ps. 89:10_].
  52   He hath put down princes from _their_ thrones,
       And hath exalted them of low degree [_see Job 5:11; 12:19_].
  53   The hungry he hath filled with good things;
       And the rich he hath sent empty away [_see Ps. 107:9_].
  54   He hath holpen Israel his servant,
       That he might remember mercy [_see Isa. 41:8-9_]
  55   (As he spake unto our fathers)
       Toward Abraham and his seed for ever [_see Gen. 17:7; Mic.
         7:20_].
  56   And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned unto her
     house.

     [Footnote 1: Gr. _bondmaiden_.]

     [Footnote 2: Or, _by_.]




Sect. 8. THE BIRTH AND CHILDHOOD OF THE BAPTIST, AND HIS DESERT LIFE

Hill Country of Judea. B.C. 7 or 6


  Luke 1:57-80

  57   Now Elisabeth's time was fulfilled that she should be delivered;
  58 and she brought forth a son. And her neighbours and her kinsfolk
     heard that the Lord had magnified his mercy toward her; and they
  59 rejoiced with her. And it came to pass on the eighth day, that they
     came to circumcise the child; and they would have called him
  60 Zacharias, after the name of his father. And his mother answered
  61 and said, Not so; but he shall be called John. And they said unto
  62 her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name. And
  63 they made signs to his father, what he would have him called. And
     he asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, saying, His name is John.
  64 And they marvelled all. And his mouth was opened immediately, and
  65 his tongue _loosed_, and he spake, blessing God. And fear came on
     all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised
  66 abroad throughout all the hill country of Judea. And all that heard
     them laid them up in their heart, saying, What then shall this
     child be? For the hand of the Lord was with him.
  67   And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and
     prophesied, saying,
  68   Blessed _be_ the Lord, the God of Israel;
       For he hath visited and wrought redemption for his people [_see
         Ps. 72:18; 111:9_],
  69   And hath raised up a horn of salvation for us
       In the house of his servant David [_see 1 Sam. 2:10; Ps. 18:3_]
  70   (As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets which have been
         since the world began),
  71   Salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us
         [_see Ps. 106:10_];
  72   To shew mercy towards our fathers,
       And to remember his holy covenant;
  73   The oath which he sware unto Abraham our father [_see Gen. 17:7;
         Lev. 26:42; Ps. 105:8; Mic. 7:20_],
  74   To grant unto us that we being delivered out of the hand of our
         enemies
       Should serve him without fear,
  75   In holiness and righteousness before him all our days.
  76   Yea and thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Most
         High:
       For thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to make ready his
         ways [_see Mal. 3:1_];
  77   To give knowledge of salvation unto his people
       In the remission of their sins,
  78   Because of the [1]tender mercy of our God,
       [2]Whereby the dayspring from on high [3]shall visit us [_see
         Mal. 4:2_],
  79   To shine upon them that sit in darkness and the shadow of death;
       To guide our feet into the way of peace [_see Isa. 8:22; 9:2_].

     deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel.[a]

Sect. 9. THE ANNUNCIATION TO JOSEPH OF THE BIRTH OF JESUS

Nazareth


  Matt. 1:18-25

  18   Now the [1]birth [2]of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When his
     mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came
  19 together she was found with child of the [3]Holy Ghost. And Joseph
     her husband, being a righteous man, and not willing to make her a
  20 public example, was minded to put her away privily. But when he
     thought on these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared
     unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not
     to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is [4]conceived in
  21 her is of the Holy Ghost. And she shall bring forth a son; and
     thou shalt call his name JESUS; for it is he that shall save his
  22 people from their sins. Now all this is come to pass, that it
     might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the
     prophet, saying,
  23   Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a
         son [_see Isa. 7:14_],
       And they shall call his name [5]Immanuel;
  24 which is, being interpreted, God with us. And Joseph arose from
     his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and
  25 took unto him his wife; and knew her not till she had brought
     forth a son: and he called his name JESUS.

     [Footnote 1: Or, _generation_: as in ver. 1 in Sect. 3.]

Sect. 10. THE BIRTH OF JESUS

Bethlehem. Probably B.C. 6 or 5


  Luke 2:1-7

   1   Now it came to pass in those days, there went out a decree from
   2 Caesar Augustus, that all the [1]world should be enrolled. This was
   3 the first enrolment made when Quirinius was governor of Syria. And
   4 all went to enrol themselves, every one to his own city.[a] And
     Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth,
     into Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem,
   5 because he was of the house and family of David; to enrol himself
   6 with Mary, who was betrothed to him, being great with child. And
     it came to pass, while they were there, the days were fulfilled
   7 that she should be delivered. And she brought forth her firstborn
     son; and she wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a
     manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.

     [Footnote 1: Gr. _inhabited earth_.]

[Footnote a: Observe how the ruler of the civilized world is
unconsciously bringing it about that the Messiah, the son of David, shall
be born at Bethlehem, though his mother's home was Nazareth. All the
previous history of Rome and of Israel gathers about this manger. As to
Quirinius, and as to the probable time of the Saviour's birth, see note 6
at the end of the book. The vindication of Luke's historical statements
in these verses is one of the triumphs of modern research, as is shown in
that note.]




Sect. 11. THE PRAISE OF THE ANGELS AND THE HOMAGE OF THE SHEPHERDS

Near Bethlehem


  Luke 2:8-20

   8   And there were shepherds in the same country abiding in the
   9 field, and keeping [1]watch by night over their flock. And an angel
     of the Lord stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone round
  10 about them: and they were sore afraid. And the angel said unto
     them, Be not afraid; for behold, I bring you good tidings of great
  11 joy which shall be to all the people: for there is born to you
     this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is [2]Christ the
  12 Lord. And this _is_ the sign unto you; Ye shall find a babe
     wrapped in swaddling clothes, and lying in a manger. And suddenly
  13 there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host
     praising[a] God, and saying,
  14   Glory to God in the highest,
       And on earth [3]peace among [4]men in whom he is well pleased.
  15   And it came to pass, when the angels went away from them into
     heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto
     Bethlehem, and see this [5]thing that is come to pass, which the
  16 Lord hath made known unto us. And they came with haste, and found
  17 both Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in the manger. And when
     they saw it, they made known concerning the saying which was
  18 spoken to them about this child. And all that heard it wondered at
  19 the things which were spoken unto them by the shepherds. But Mary
  20 kept all these [6]sayings, pondering them in her heart. And the
     shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things
     that they had heard and seen, even as it was spoken unto them.

     [Footnote 1: Or, _night-watches_.]

Sect. 12. THE CIRCUMCISION OF JESUS

Bethlehem


  Luke 2:21

  21   And when eight days were fulfilled for circumcising him [_see
     Gen. 17:12; Lev. 12:3_], his name was called JESUS, which was so
     called by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.




Sect. 13. THE PRESENTATION IN THE TEMPLE WITH THE HOMAGE OF SIMEON AND
ANNA

Jerusalem


  Luke 2:22-38

  22   And when the days of their purification according to the law of
     Moses were fulfilled, they brought him up to Jerusalem, to present
  23 him to the Lord (as it is written in the law of the Lord, Every
     male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord)
  24 [_see Ex. 13:2, 12, 15; Lev. 12:1-8_], and to offer a sacrifice
     according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of
  25 turtledoves, or two young pigeons. And behold, there was a man in
     Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and this man was righteous and
     devout, looking for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Spirit
  26 was upon him. And it had been revealed unto him by the Holy
     Spirit, that he should not see death, before he had seen the
  27 Lord's Christ. And he came in the Spirit into the temple: and when
     the parents brought in the child Jesus, that they might do
  28 concerning him after the custom of the law, then he received him
     into his arms, and blessed God, and said,[a]
  29   Now lettest thou thy [1]servant depart, O [2]Lord,
       According to thy word, in peace;
  30   For mine eyes have seen thy salvation [_see Isa. 52:10_],
  31   Which thou hast prepared before the face of all peoples;
  32   A light for [3]revelation to the Gentiles,
       And the glory of thy people Israel [_see Isa. 42:6; 49:6_].
  33 And his father and his mother were marvelling at the things which
  34 were spoken concerning him; and Simeon blessed them, and said unto
     Mary his mother, Behold, this _child_ is set for the falling and
     rising up of many in Israel; and for a sign which is spoken
  35 against; yea and a sword shall pierce through thine own soul; that
  36 thoughts out of many hearts may be revealed. And there was one
     Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher
     (she was [4]of a great age, having lived with a husband seven
  37 years from her virginity, and she had been a widow even for
     fourscore and four years), which departed not from the temple,
  38 worshipping with fastings and supplications night and day. And
     coming up at that very hour she gave thanks unto God, and spake of
     him to all them that were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.

     [Footnote 4: Gr. _advanced in many days_.]

[Footnote a: The four New Testament psalms, given by Luke, breathe the
atmosphere of Old Testament piety, quite in contrast to the formalism of
the Pharisees and yet thoroughly Jewish in background and Christian in
sentiment. But it is primitive Christian feeling. Section 7 gives the
Magnificat of Mary in response to the song of Elisabeth in Sect. 6. In
Sect. 8 we have the _Benedictus_ of Zacharias and in Sect. 13 The _Nunc
Dimittis_ of Simeon.]




Sect. 14. MAGI VISIT THE NEW-BORN KING OF THE JEWS

Jerusalem and Bethlehem


  Matt. 2:1-12

   1   Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of
     Herod the king, behold, [1]wise men from the east [_see Num.
   2 24:17_] came to Jerusalem, saying, [2]Where is he that is born King
     of the Jews? for we saw his star in the east, and are come to
   3 worship him. And when Herod the king heard it, he was troubled, and
   4 all Jerusalem with him. And gathering together all the chief
     priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the
   5 Christ should be born. And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of
     Judea: for thus it is written [3]by the prophet,
   6   And thou Bethlehem, land of Judah,
       Art in no wise least among the princes of Judah:
       For out of thee shall come forth a governor [_see Mic. 5:1-2_],
       Which shall be shepherd of my people Israel.
   7 Then Herod privily called the [1]wise men, and learned of them
   8 carefully [4]what time the star appeared. And he sent them to
     Bethlehem, and said, Go and search out carefully concerning the
     young child; and when ye have found _him_, bring me word, that I
   9 also may come and worship him. And they, having heard the king,
     went their way; and lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went
     before them, till it came and stood over where the young child
  10 was. And when they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding
  11 great joy. And they came into the house and saw the young child
     with Mary his mother; and they fell down and worshipped him; and
     opening their treasures they offered unto him gifts, gold and
  12 frankincense and myrrh. And being warned _of God_ in a dream that
     they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own
     country another way.

Sect. 15. THE CHILD JESUS CARRIED TO EGYPT, AND THE CHILDREN AT BETHLEHEM
SLAIN

Probably B.C. 5


  Matt. 2:13-18

  13   Now when they were departed, behold, an angel of the Lord
     appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise and take the young
     child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until
     I tell thee: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.
  14 And he arose and took the young child and his mother by night, and
  15 departed into Egypt; and was there until the death of Herod: that
     it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the
     prophet, saying, Out of Egypt did I call my son [_see Hos. 11:1_].
  16 Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the [1]wise men, was
     exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the male children
     that were in Bethlehem, and in all the borders thereof, from two
     years old and under, according to the time which he had carefully
  17 learned of the [1]wise men. Then was fulfilled that which was
     spoken [2]by Jeremiah the prophet, saying [_see Jer. 31:15_],
  18   A voice was heard in Ramah,
       Weeping and great mourning,
       Rachel weeping for her children;
       And she would not be comforted, because they are not.

Sect. 16. THE CHILD BROUGHT FROM EGYPT TO NAZARETH

Probably B.C. 4


  Matt. 2:19-23                                 |Luke 2:39
                                                |
  19   But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel|
     of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph |
  20 in Egypt, saying, Arise and take the young |39   And when they
     child and his mother, and go into the land |   had accomplished
     of Israel: for they are dead that sought   |   all things that were
  21 the young child's life. And he arose and   |   according to the law
     took the young child and his mother, and   |   of the Lord, they
  22 came into the land of Israel. But when he  |   returned into
     heard that Archelaus was reigning over     |   Galilee, to their
     Judea in the room of his father Herod, he  |   own city Nazareth.
     was afraid to go thither; and being warned |
     _of God_ in a dream, he withdrew into the  |
  23 parts of Galilee, and came and dwelt in a  |
     city called Nazareth: that it might be     |
     fulfilled which was spoken [1]by the       |
     prophets,[a] that he should be called a    |
     Nazarene.                                  |

Branch, though Nazareth is not mentioned in the Old Testament.]




Sect. 17. THE CHILDHOOD OF JESUS AT NAZARETH

Probably B.C. 4 to A.D. 7


  Luke 2:40

  40   And the child grew, and waxed strong, [1]filled with wisdom: and
     the grace of God was upon him.[a]

     [Footnote 1: Gr. _becoming full of wisdom_.]

[Footnote a: This simple statement of Luke tells more in one sentence
than all the apocryphal Gospels of the Infancy, with their silly legends
about the miraculous prowess of the child Jesus.]




Sect. 18. THE VISIT OF THE BOY JESUS TO JERUSALEM WHEN TWELVE YEARS OLD

Probably A.D. 7 or 8


  Luke 2:41-50

  41   And his parents went every year to Jerusalem at the feast of the
  42 passover [_see Ex. 23:14-17; Deut. 16:1-8_]. And when he was
  43 twelve years old, they went up after the custom of the feast; and
     when they had fulfilled the days, as they were returning, the boy
     Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and his parents knew it not;
  44 but supposing him to be in the company, they went a day's journey;
  45 and they sought for him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance: and
     when they found him not, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking for
  46 him. And it came to pass, after three days they found him in the
     temple, sitting in the midst of the [1]doctors, both hearing them,
  47 and asking them questions: and all that heard him were amazed at
  48 his understanding and his answers. And when they saw him, they
     were astonished: and his mother said unto him, [2]Son, why hast
     thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I sought thee
  49 sorrowing. And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me?
  50 wist ye not that I must be [3]in my Father's house? And they
     understood not the saying which he spake unto them.

Sect. 19. THE EIGHTEEN YEARS[a] AT NAZARETH

Probably A.D. 7 to A.D. 26 (or 6 to 25)


  Luke 2:51-52

  51   And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth; and he was
     subject unto them: and his mother kept all _these_ [1]sayings in
     her heart.
  52   And Jesus advanced in wisdom and [2]stature, and in [3]favour
     with God and men [_see 1 Sam. 2:26_].

     [Footnote 1: Or, _things_.]

     [Footnote 2: Or, _age_.]

     [Footnote 3: Or, _grace_.]

[Footnote a: After the return to Nazareth, we know nothing of Jesus' life
at that place beyond the general statements of Luke 2:52, with the
knowledge and dispositions indicated in the narrative of Sect. 18 and the
fact that he was a carpenter, until he comes forth to be baptized by
John, his forerunner. The social and political conditions of this period
in Galilee are described by Edersheim, D. Smith, and other writers on the
Life of Jesus, and briefly stated in Broadus's Commentary on Matthew, p.
30 f. Dwell on the general statement of Luke 2:52. Other passages throw
light on the life in Nazareth as to habits of worship (Luke 4:16), the
family group of brothers and sisters (Mark 6:3 = Matt. 13:55 f.), work as
carpenter (_ibid._). A helpful book on this obscure period is Ramsay's
_The Education of Christ_.]

Sect. 22. A SPECIMEN[a] OF JOHN'S PREACHING


  Matt. 3:7-10                   |Luke 3:7-14
                                 |
   7 But when he saw many of the | 7   He said therefore to the
     Pharisees and Sadducees     |   multitudes that went out to be
     coming to his baptism, he   |   baptized of him, Ye offspring of

     of vipers, who warned you to| 8 the wrath to come? Bring forth

   9 worthy of [1]repentance: and|   within yourselves, We have Abraham
     think not to say within     |   to our father: for I say unto you,
     yourselves, We have Abraham |   that God is able of these stones to

     unto you, that God is able  | 9 And even now is the axe also laid

                                 |   that hath none; and he that hath
  12 food, let him do likewise. And there came also [2]publicans to be
  13 baptized, and they said unto him, [3]Master, what must we do? And
  14 he said unto them, Extort no more than that which is appointed
     you. And [4]soldiers also asked him, saying, And we, what must we
     do? And he said unto them, Do violence to no man, neither [5]exact
     _anything_ wrongfully; and be content with your wages.

Sect. 23. THE FORERUNNER'S PICTURE OF THE MESSIAH BEFORE SEEING HIM


  Mark 1:7-8             |Matt. 3:11-12          |Luke 3:15-18
                         |                       |
   7 And he preached,    |11 I indeed baptize    |15   And as the

     and to gather the wheat into his garner; but the chaff he will burn
     up with unquenchable fire.

[Footnote a: One can easily put together all that we are told of John the
Baptist in John 1:6-15 and in Sections 4, 6, 8, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26,
27, 28, 33, 34, 49, 57, 71, 86, 132. See also Acts 1:5, 22; 10:37; 13:24;
18:25; 19:1-7. For a full discussion of the Baptist see my _John the
Loyal_. These months of John's ministry prepared the way for the
Messiah.]




PART VI

THE BEGINNING OF CHRIST'S PUBLIC MINISTRY

THE YEAR OF OBSCURITY[a]

Probably Part of A.D. 26 and 27

_In all parts of the Holy Land (the first Perean Ministry, the first
Galilean Ministry, the first Judean Ministry, the first Samaritan
Ministry). Sects. 24-36. This early ministry includes the baptism, the
temptation, John's witness to Jesus, the first disciples, the first
miracle and work in Galilee, the first work in Judea, the arrest of John,
the work in Samaria, and the return to Galilee._

[Footnote a: The precise duration of this early ministry cannot be
determined. Our Lord's baptism must have been at least two months
_before_ the Passover, and may have been some weeks or months earlier.
Then the highly successful ministry in Judea _after_ the Passover must
have lasted several months (John 3:22; 4:1-3). If the "yet four months"
in John 4:35 be understood to be not a common saying as to the usual
interval between seedtime and harvest, but a statement that it was _then_
just four months before harvest, that would make the Judean ministry
extend eight months after the Passover. But this interpretation is upon
the whole improbable, and we can only say that the opening ministry
lasted several months. The time occupied makes very little difference for
our understanding the events and discourses. All of the incidents during
this period after the temptation are given in John's Gospel. But for the
Fourth Gospel we should not know that Jesus did not plunge at once into
the great Galilean Ministry.]




Sect. 24. JESUS BAPTIZED BY JOHN IN THE JORDAN

Bethany beyond Jordan. Probably A.D. 26


  Mark 1:9-11            |Matt. 3:13-17          |Luke 3:21-23
                         |                       |
   9   And it came to    |13   Then cometh Jesus |
     pass in those days, |   from Galilee to the |
     that Jesus came from|   [a]Jordan unto John,|
     Nazareth of Galilee,|   to be baptized of   |
     and was baptized of |14 him. But John would |
     John [4]in the      |   have hindered him,  |
     Jordan.             |   saying, I have need |
                         |   to be baptized of   |
                         |   thee, and comest    |
                         |15 thou to me? But     |
                         |   Jesus answering said|
                         |   unto him, Suffer    |
                         |   [1]_it_ now: for    |
                         |   thus it becometh us |
                         |   to fulfil all       |
                         |   righteousness. Then |21   Now it came to
  10 And straightway     |   he suffereth him.   |   pass, when all the
     coming up out of the|16 And Jesus, when he  |   people were
     water, he saw the   |   was baptized, went  |   baptized, that,
     heavens rent        |   up straightway from |   Jesus also having
                         |   the water: and lo,  |   been baptized, and
                         |   the heavens were    |   praying, the
                         |   opened [2]unto him, |22 heaven was opened,
                         |   and he saw the      |   and the Holy Ghost
     asunder, and the    |   Spirit of God       |   [b]descended in a
     Spirit as a dove    |   descending as a     |   bodily form, as a
     descending upon him:|   dove, and coming    |   dove, upon him
  11 and a voice came out|17 upon him; and lo, a |   [_see John
     of the heavens, Thou|   voice out of the    |   1:32-34_], and a
     art my beloved Son, |   heavens, saying,    |   voice came out of
     in thee I am well   |   [3]This is my       |   heaven, Thou art

     2:7; Isa. 42:1_].   |   I am well pleased.  |   thee [c]I am well
                         |                       |23 pleased. And Jesus
                         |                       |   himself, when he
                         |                       |   began _to teach_,
                         |                       |   was about thirty
                         |                       |   years of age.

     [Footnote 1: Or, me.]

     [Footnote 2: Some ancient authorities omit _unto him_.]

     pleased._]

     [Footnote 4: Gr. _into_.]

[Footnote a: The Gospel of the Hebrews (one of the apocryphal gospels) is
quoted by Jerome (_adv. Pelag._ iii, 2) as having the following: "Behold,
the Lord's mother and His brethren were saying to Him, John the Baptist
baptizes unto the remission of sins; let us go and be baptized by him.
But he said unto them, What sin have I done, that I should go and be
baptized by him? unless perchance this very thing which I have said is an
ignorance."]

[Footnote b: The Gospel of John does not describe the baptism of Jesus,
but refers to the event in a way that shows knowledge of the Synoptic
Gospels.]

[Footnote c: Codex Bezae (D) reads in Luke: "Thou art my beloved son,
to-day have I begotten thee." The Gospel of the Ebionites has: "Thou art
my beloved son, in thee I am well pleased, to-day I have begotten thee."

Sect. 25. THE THREE TEMPTATIONS[a] OF JESUS

The Wilderness of Judea. Probably A.D. 26


  Mark 1:12-13       |Matt. 4:1-11            |Luke 4:1-13

     Spirit driveth  |   the wilderness to be |   returned from the
     him forth into  |   tempted of the devil.|   Jordan, and was led
     the wilderness. | 2 And when he had      | 2 [3]by the Spirit in
  13 And he was in   |   fasted forty days and|   the wilderness during
     the wilderness  |   forty nights, he     |   forty days, being
     forty days      |   afterward hungered.  |   tempted of the devil
     tempted of      | 3 And the tempter came |   [_see Heb. 4:15_].
     Satan; and he   |   and said unto him, If|   And he did eat

                     |   these stones become  |   were completed, he
                     | 4 [1]bread. But he     | 3 hungered. And the
                     |   answered and said, It|   devil said unto him,
                     |   is written [_see     |   If thou art the Son
                     |   Deut. 8:3_], Man     |   of God, command this

                     |   bread alone, but by  | 4 [4]bread. And Jesus
                     |   every word that      |   answered unto him, It
                     |   proceedeth out of the|   is written [_see
                     | 5 mouth of God. Then   |   Deut. 8:3_], Man

                     |   into the holy city;  | 5 bread alone. And he
                     |   and he set him on the|   led him up, and
                     |   [2]pinnacle of the   |   shewed him all the

                     |     He shall give his  |   the glory of them:

[Footnote a: Mark gives only a summary account while the Logia (the
oldest known record) tells the temptations in detail. This early document
reveals the Messianic consciousness of Jesus as distinctly as it appears
in the Gospel of John. The record of the baptism in Sect. 24 and of the
temptation in Sect. 25 goes back to the two oldest strata of the Gospel
sources (Mark or the Memoirs of Peter and the Logia of Matthew) and shows
that Jesus enters upon his Messianic work knowing that he had his
Father's approval and the power of the Holy Spirit upon him.]




Sect. 26. THE TESTIMONY OF THE BAPTIST TO THE COMMITTEE OF THE SANHEDRIN

At Bethany beyond Jordan


  John 1:19-28

  19   And this is the witness of John, when the Jews sent unto him from
  20 Jerusalem priests and Levites to ask him, Who art thou? And he
     confessed, and denied not; and he confessed, I am not the Christ.
  21 And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elijah? And he saith, I am
  22 not. Art thou the prophet? And he answered, No. They said
     therefore unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to
  23 them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself? He said, I am the
     voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the
  24 Lord, as said Isaiah the prophet [_see Isa. 40:3_]. [1]And they
  25 had been sent from the Pharisees.[a] And they asked him, and said
     unto him, Why then baptizest thou, if thou art not the Christ,
  26 neither Elijah, neither the prophet? John answered them, saying, I
     baptize [2]with water: in the midst of you standeth one whom ye
  27 know not, _even_ he that cometh after me, the latchet of whose
  28 shoe I am not worthy to unloose. These things were done in
     [3]Bethany beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.

     [Footnote 1: Or, _And_ certain _had been sent from among the
     Pharisees_.]

     [Footnote 2: Or, _in_.]

     [Footnote 3: Many ancient authorities read _Bethabarah_, some
     _Betharabah_.]

[Footnote a: In 1:19 the priests and Levites are Sadducees. The idea
seems to be that the Pharisees had the Sadducees sent on this embassy
(_cf._ Sect. 22). Later Jesus will say that John was Elijah that was to
come; some will even take Jesus to be Elijah.]




Sect. 27. JOHN'S IDENTIFICATION OF JESUS AS THE MESSIAH

At Bethany beyond the Jordan


  John 1:29-34

  29   On the morrow he seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold,
     the Lamb of God, which [1]taketh away the sin of the world [_see
  30 Isa. 53:7_]! This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man
  31 which is become before me: for he was [2]before me. And I knew him
     not; but that he should be made manifest to Israel, for this cause
  32 came I baptizing [3]with water. And John bare witness, saying, I
     have beheld the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven; and it
  33 abode upon him. And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize
     [3]with water, he said unto me, Upon whomsoever thou shalt see the
     Spirit descending, and abiding upon him, the same is he that
  34 baptizeth [3]with the Holy Spirit. And I have seen, and have borne
     witness that this is the son of God.[a]

     [Footnote 1: Or, _beareth the sin._]

     [Footnote 2: Gr. _first in regard of me_.]

     [Footnote 3: Or, _in_.]

[Footnote a: Put together the Baptist's testimonies to Jesus in sections
21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 33, 57. Add John 1:6-15. Note also the four
testimonies of Jesus to John, sections 49, 57, 86, 132. Observe the four
successive days here in John 1:19, 29, 35, 43, and the third day from the
last in John 2:1, making a week that is covered in detail (_cf._ the
Passion Week at the close). We have other glimpses of special days in the
ministry, as the Busy Day of the blasphemous accusation and the parables
(Matt. 12 and 13). In John 1:39 the very hour is preserved, probably
Roman time (ten in the morning), as John writes long after the
destruction of Jerusalem and outside of Palestine and uses the Roman
reckoning (midnight to midnight) in John 20:19. But see note 11 at end of
Harmony for Ramsay's objections to this view.]




Sect. 28. JESUS MAKES HIS FIRST[a] DISCIPLES

At Bethany beyond the Jordan


  John 1:35-51

  35   Again on the morrow John was standing, and two of his disciples;
  36 and he looked upon Jesus as he walked, and saith, Behold, the Lamb
  37 of God [_see Isa. 53:7_]! And the two disciples heard him speak,
  38 and they followed Jesus. And Jesus turned, and beheld them
     following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? And they said unto
     him, Rabbi (which is to say, being interpreted, [1]Master), where
  39 abidest thou? He saith unto them, Come, and ye shall see. They
     came therefore and saw where he abode; and they abode with him
  40 that day: it was about the tenth hour. One of the two that heard
     John _speak_, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.
  41 He findeth first his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We
     have found the Messiah (which is, being interpreted, [2]Christ).
  42 He brought him unto Jesus. Jesus looked upon him, and said, thou
     art Simon the son of [3]John: thou shalt be called Cephas (which
     is by interpretation, [4]Peter).
  43   On the morrow he was minded to go forth into Galilee, and he
  44 findeth Philip: and Jesus saith unto him, Follow me. Now Philip
  45 was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter. Philip
     findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom
     Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth,
  46 the son of Joseph. And Nathanael said unto him, Can any good thing
  47 come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see. Jesus
     saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold, an
  48 Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile! Nathanael saith unto him,
     Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before
     Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.
  49 Nathanael answered him, Rabbi, thou art the son of God; thou art
  50 King of Israel[b] [_see 2 Sam. 7:14; Ps. 2:7_]. Jesus answered and
     said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee underneath the
     fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than
  51 these. And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye
     shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and
     descending upon the Son of man[c] [_see Gen. 28:12_].

Sect. 29. JESUS WORKS HIS FIRST MIRACLE

At Cana in Galilee


  John 2:1-11

   1   And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and
   2 the mother of Jesus was there: and Jesus also was bidden, and his
   3 disciples, to the marriage. And when the wine failed, the mother
   4 of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine. And Jesus saith unto
     her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet
   5 come. His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto
   6 you, do it. Now there were six waterpots of stone set there after
     the Jews' manner of purifying, containing two or three firkins
   7 apiece. Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And
   8 they filled them up to the brim. And he saith unto them, Draw out
     now, and bear unto the [1]ruler of the feast. And they bare it.
   9 And when the ruler of the feast tasted the water [2]now become
     wine, and knew not whence it was (but the servants which had drawn
     the water knew), the ruler of the feast calleth the bridegroom,
  10 and saith unto him, Every man setteth on first the good wine; and
     when _men_ have drunk freely, _then_ that which is worse: thou
  11 hast kept the good wine until now. This beginning of his signs did
     Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his
     disciples believed on him.

     [Footnote 1: Or, _steward_.]

     [Footnote 2: Or, _that it had become_.]




Sect. 30. JESUS MAKES A FIRST SOJOURN AT CAPERNAUM, ACCOMPANIED BY HIS
KINDRED AND HIS EARLY DISCIPLES

(Later Capernaum will become his home)


  John 2:12

  12   After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and
     _his_ brethren, and his disciples: and there they abode not many
     days.




Sect. 31. THE FIRST[a] CLEANSING OF THE TEMPLE AT THE PASSOVER

Jerusalem.[b] Probably A.D. 27


  John 2:13-22

  13   And the passover[c] of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to
  14 Jerusalem. And he found in the temple those that sold oxen and
  15 sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting: and he made a
     scourge of cords, and cast all out of the temple, both the sheep
     and the oxen; and he poured out the changers' money, and overthrew
  16 their tables; and to them that sold the doves he said, Take these
     things hence; make not my Father's house a house of merchandise.
  17 His disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine
  18 house shall eat me up [_see Ps. 69:9_]. The Jews therefore
     answered and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing
  19 thou doest these things? Jesus answered and said unto them,
  20 Destroy this [1]temple, and in three days I will raise it up. The
     Jews therefore said, Forty and six years was this [1]temple in
  21 building, and wilt thou raise it up in three days? But he spake of
  22 the [1]temple of his body. When therefore he was raised from the
     dead, his disciples remembered that he spake this; and they
     believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.

     [Footnote 1: Or, _sanctuary_.]

[Footnote a: Many scholars consider this the same incident as that in the
Synoptic Gospels and placed by them in Passion Week (Sect. 129) probably
on Monday. It is urged that Jesus would not have repeated such an act and
hence one must follow either the order of John or of the Synoptics. But
there is no inherent difficulty in the repetition of such an act when one
reflects on the natural indignation of Jesus at the desecration of the
temple on his visit during his ministry and considers that Jesus may have
wished to make one last protest at the close of his ministry. Certainty,
of course, is not possible in such an argument one way or the other.]

[Footnote b: Observe the successive _scenes_ of this early
ministry--beside the Jordan, on the eastern side, at Cana of Galilee, at
Capernaum, at Jerusalem, in Judea, in Samaria.]

[Footnote c: This is the first of the passovers in John's Gospel (2:13;
6:4; 13:1). There may have been another.]




Sect. 32. THE INTERVIEW OF NICODEMUS WITH JESUS

At Jerusalem during the Passover


  John 2:23 to 3:21

  23   Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, during the feast,
  24 many believed on his name, beholding his signs which he did. But
  25 Jesus did not trust himself unto them, for that he knew all men,
     and because he needed not that any one should bear witness
     concerning [1]man; for he himself knew what was in man.
   1   Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus,[a] a ruler
   2 of the Jews: the same came unto him by night, and said to him,
     Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man
   3 can do these signs that thou doest, except God be with him. Jesus
     answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee,
     Except a man be born [2]anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God.
   4 Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old?
     can he enter a second time into his mother's womb, and be born?
   5 Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be
     born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of
   6 God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is
   7 born of the Spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye
   8 must be born [2]anew. [3]The wind bloweth where it listeth, and
     thou hearest the voice thereof, but knowest not whence it cometh,
     and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.
   9 Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?
  10 Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou the teacher of Israel,
  11 and understandest not these things? Verily, verily, I say unto
     thee, We speak that we do know, and bear witness of that we have
  12 seen; and ye receive not our witness. If I told you earthly
     things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you
  13 heavenly things? And no man hath ascended into heaven, but he that
     descended out of heaven, _even_ the Son of man, [4]which is in
  14 heaven. And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness [_see
  15 Num. 21:8-9_], even so must the Son of man be lifted up: that
     whosoever [5]believeth may in him have eternal life.
  16   For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son,
     that whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but have
  17 eternal life. For God sent not the Son into the world to judge the
  18 world; but that the world should be saved through him. He that
     believeth on him is not judged: he that believeth not has been
     judged already, because he hath not believed on the name of the
  19 only begotten Son of God. And this is the judgment, that the light
     is come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the
  20 light; for their works were evil. For every one that [6]doeth ill
     hateth the light, and cometh not to the light, lest his works
  21 should be [7]reproved. But he that doeth the truth cometh to the
     light, that his works may be made manifest, [8]that they have been
     wrought in God.

and station proved not unworthy of the trust.]




Sect. 33. THE PARALLEL MINISTRY OF JESUS AND JOHN WITH JOHN'S LOYALTY TO
JESUS[a]


  John 3:22-36

  22   After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of
  23 Judea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized. And John also
     was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there [1]was much
  24 water there: and they came, and were baptized. For John was not
  25 yet cast into prison. There arose therefore a questioning on the
  26 part of John's disciples with a Jew about purifying. And they came
     unto John, and said to him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond
     Jordan, to whom thou hast borne witness, behold, the same
  27 baptizeth, and all men come to him. John answered and said, A man
  28 can receive nothing, except it have been given him from heaven. Ye
     yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but,
  29 that I am sent before him. He that hath the bride is the
     bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and
     heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice:
  30 this my joy therefore is fulfilled. He must increase, but I must
     decrease.
  31   He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth
     is of the earth, and of the earth he speaketh: [2]he that cometh
  32 from heaven is above all. What he hath seen and heard, of that he
  33 beareth witness; and no man receiveth his witness. He that hath
     received his witness hath set his seal to _this_, that God is
  34 true. For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for he
  35 giveth not the Spirit by measure. The Father loveth the Son, and
  36 hath given all things into his hand. He that believeth on the Son
     hath eternal life; but he that [3]obeyeth not the Son shall not
     see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.

     [Footnote 1: Gr. _were many waters_.]

     [Footnote 2: Some ancient authorities read _he that cometh from
     heaven beareth witness of what he hath seen and heard_.]

     [Footnote 3: Or, _believeth not_.]

Jordan and many in Jerusalem. Now he is surpassing John. On John's
loyalty to Jesus see my _John the Loyal_.]




Sect. 34. CHRIST'S REASONS FOR LEAVING JUDEA


  John 4:1-4

   1   When therefore the Lord knew how that the Pharisees had heard
   2 that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John
   3 (although Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples), he left
   4 Judea, and departed again into Galilee. And he must needs pass
     through Samaria.


  Luke 3:19, 20

  19   But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his
     brother's wife, and for all the evil things which Herod had done,
  20 added yet this above all, that he shut up John in prison.[a]


  Mark 1:14              |Matt. 4:12             |Luke 4:14
                         |                       |
  14   Now after that    |12   Now when he heard |14   And Jesus
     John was delivered  |   that John was       |   returned in the
     up, Jesus came into |   delivered up, he    |   power of the Spirit
     Galilee.            |   withdrew into       |   into Galilee.
                         |   Galilee.            |

[Footnote a: The place of John's imprisonment was Machaerus, east of the
Dead Sea. See Josephus. _War_, Ch. VII, vi. In _Antiquities_, Ch. XVIII,
v, 2 Josephus gives the public and political reason for John's
imprisonment because of Herod's fear of a revolution. He "feared lest the
great influences John had over the people might put it into his power and
inclination to raise a rebellion."]




Sect. 35. JESUS IN SAMARIA.[a]

At Jacob's Well and in Sychar


  John 4:5-42

   5   So he cometh to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near to the
   6 parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph: and Jacob's
     [1]well was there [_see Josh. 24:32_]. Jesus therefore, being
     wearied with his journey, sat [2]thus by the [1]well. It was about
   7 the sixth hour. There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water:
   8 Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink. For his disciples were
   9 gone away into the city to buy food. The Samaritan woman therefore
     saith unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of
     me, which am a Samaritan woman? ([3]For Jews have no dealings with
  10 Samaritans.) Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the
     gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink;
     thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee
  11 living water. The woman saith unto him, [4]Sir, thou hast nothing
     to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou
  12 that living water? Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which
     gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his sons, and his
  13 cattle? Jesus answered and said unto her, Every one that drinketh
  14 of this water shall thirst again: but whosoever drinketh of the
     water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that
     I shall give him shall become in him a well of water springing up
  15 unto eternal life. The woman saith unto him, [4]Sir, give me this
     water, that I thirst not, neither come all the way hither to draw.
  16 Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither. The
  17 woman answered and said unto him, I have no husband. Jesus saith
  18 unto her, Thou saidst well, I have no husband: for thou hast had
     five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: this
  19 hast thou said truly. The woman saith unto him, [4]Sir, I perceive
  20 that thou art a prophet. Our fathers worshipped in this mountain;
     and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to
  21 worship. Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh,
     when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, shall ye worship
  22 the Father. Ye worship that which ye know not: we worship that
  23 which we know: for salvation is from the Jews. But the hour
     cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the
     Father in spirit and truth: [5]for such doth the Father seek to be
  24 his worshippers. [6]God is a Spirit: and they that worship him
  25 must worship in spirit and truth. The woman saith unto him, I know
     that Messiah cometh (which is called Christ): when he is come, he
  26 will declare unto us all things. Jesus saith unto her, I that
     speak unto thee am _he_.
  27   And upon this came his disciples; and they marvelled that he was
     speaking with a woman; yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why
  28 speakest thou with her? So the woman left her waterpot, and went
  29 away into the city, and saith to the men, Come, see a man, which
  30 told me all things that _ever_ I did: can this be the Christ? They
  31 went out of the city, and were coming to him. In the mean while
  32 the disciples prayed him, saying, Rabbi, eat. But he said to them,
  33 I have meat to eat that ye know not. The disciples therefore said
  34 one to another, Hath any man brought him _aught_ to eat? Jesus
     saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me,
  35 and to accomplish his work. Say not ye, There are yet four months,
     and _then_ cometh the harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up
     your eyes, and look on the fields, that they are [7]white already
  36 unto harvest. He that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit
     unto life eternal; that he that soweth and he that reapeth may
  37 rejoice together. For herein is the saying true, One soweth, and
  38 another reapeth. I sent you to reap that whereon ye have not
     laboured: others have laboured, and ye are entered into their
     labour.
  39   And from that city many of the Samaritans believed on him
     [a]because of the word of the woman, who testified, He told me all
  40 things that _ever_ I did. So when the Samaritans came unto him,
     they besought him to abide with them: and he abode there two days.
  41 And many more believed because of his word; and they said to the
  42 woman, Now we believe, not because of thy speaking: for we have
     heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Saviour of
     the world.[b]

     [Footnote 1: Gr. _spring_: and so in ver. 14; but not in ver. 11,
     12.]

     [Footnote 2: Or, _as he was_.]

     [Footnote 3: Some ancient authorities omit _For Jews have no
     dealings with Samaritans._]

     [Footnote 4: Or, _Lord_.]

     [Footnote 5: Or, _for such the Father also seeketh_.]

     [Footnote 6: Or, _God is spirit_.]

     [Footnote 7: Or, _white unto harvest. Already he that reapeth
     &c._]

[Footnote a: Notice that John also had recently been preaching to
Samaritans (Sect. 33) and compare hereafter Philip's work in the city of
Samaria (Acts 8:5 ff.)]

[Footnote b: In this early ministry Jesus allowed himself to be regarded
as the Messiah by his first disciples (Sect. 28), and personally declared
that he was the Messiah to the woman at the well (Sect. 35) (John 4:26),
which many other Samaritans also personally believed (John 4:39, 42). He
never declared this to the Jewish rulers at Jerusalem till the very end
(Sect. 155), doubtless because such an avowal would lead them to kill
him, and so must not be made till his work in teaching the people and
training his disciples should be completed. Compare what he says later to
Peter in Matt. 16:17-20 (Sect. 82). At the baptism and the temptation of
Jesus it was clear that Jesus knew that he was the Son of God, the
Messiah, and was so regarded by the Baptist. Events in Judea and Galilee
change the early policy of Jesus and lead to silence on his part in the
use of the word Messiah, though many of the people know that he makes
Messianic claims and the rulers in Jerusalem come to suspect him and to
fear him. See my volume on _The Pharisees and Jesus_.]




Sect. 36. THE ARRIVAL OF JESUS IN GALILEE


  John 4:43-45

  43   And after the two days he went forth from thence into Galilee.
  44 For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his
  45 own country [_see Luke 4:24; Mark 6:4; Matt. 13:57_]. So when he
     came into Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all the
     things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went
     unto the feast.




PART VII

THE GREAT GALILEAN MINISTRY

Probably[a] Autumn of A.D. 27 to Spring of 29

(Apparently about a year and a half)

_Sects. 37-71. Great fulness of detail in Mark for this period and
condensed report in Luke while Matthew is chiefly topical in this
portion. Mark's Gospel plunges at once into the Great Galilean Ministry
(cf. Peter's summary of Christ's life in Acts 10:36-43 to the household
of Cornelius). The mass of material makes clear grouping difficult, but
there is progress[b] in the development of events._

    1. The Rejection at Nazareth and the New Home in Capernaum, Sects.
         37-43.

    2. The First Tour of Galilee with the Four Fishermen and the Call
         of Matthew (Levi) on the Return with the Growing Fame of
         Jesus, Sects. 44-48.

    3. The Sabbath Controversy in Jerusalem and in Galilee, Sects. 49-51.

    4. The Choice of the Twelve and the Sermon on the Mount, Sects.
         52-54.

    5. The Spread of Christ's Influence and the Inquiry from John in
         Prison, Sects. 55-59.

    6. The Second Tour of Galilee (now with the Twelve) and the Intense
         Hostility of the Pharisees, Sects. 60-63.

    7. The First Great Group of Parables with the Visit to Gerasa
        (Khersa) and to Nazareth (final one), Sects. 64-69.

    8. The Third Tour of Galilee (Following the Twelve) and the Effect
         on Herod Antipas, Sects. 70-71.

[Footnote a: We cannot confidently determine the length of the ministry
in Galilee. We are not sure whether it _began_ in summer or late autumn
(see footnote 7 in Explanatory Notes at end of Harmony). If the feast of
John 5:1 was a passover or there is an unknown passover, the Galilean
ministry lasted at least sixteen months, for it _ended_ when another
passover was near (John 6:4). Otherwise we should not certainly know that
it lasted more than some six or eight months. About the two subsequent
periods of our Lord's ministry we shall find no room to question that
each lasted six months; but _here_ we have to admit much uncertainty as
to the time. After all, a determination of the time employed would be a
matter of very little importance to our study of this period. But the
immense amount of material in this period argues for a length of over a
year.]

[Footnote b: Throughout this great ministry in Galilee, and the periods
that will follow after, the reader ought to trace carefully the
_progress_ of the history along several lines: (1) the Saviour's
progressive self-manifestation; (2) the gradual training of the Twelve
who are to carry on his teaching and work after his death; (3) the
deepening and spreading hostility of the Jewish influential classes and
official rulers. By constantly observing these parallel lines of
progress, it will be seen that the history and teachings of our Lord
exhibit a vital growth, moving on to an end by him foreseen (Luke 12:50),
when the hostility of the rulers will culminate as he before the
Sanhedrin avows himself to be the Messiah, and the Twelve will be almost
prepared to succeed him.]




Sect. 37. GENERAL ACCOUNT OF HIS TEACHING IN GALILEE


  Mark 1:14-15           |Matt. 4:17             |Luke 4:14-15
                         |                       |
  14   [Now after that   |17   From that time    |14   [And Jesus
     John was delivered  |   began Jesus to      |   returned in the
     up, Jesus came into |   preach, and to say, |   power of [_see
     Galilee], preaching |   Repent ye; for the  |   John 4:3, 43_] the
     the gospel of God,  |   kingdom of heaven is|   Spirit into
  15 and saying, The time|   at hand.            |   Galilee]: and a
     is fulfilled, and   |                       |   fame went out
     the kingdom of God  |                       |   concerning him
     is at hand: repent  |                       |   through all the
     ye, and believe in  |                       |   region round
     the gospel.         |                       |15 about. And he
                         |                       |   taught in their
                         |                       |   synagogues, being
                         |                       |   glorified of all.




_In sections 38-43 (the Rejection at Nazareth and the New Home in
Capernaum) Jesus revisits Cana and Nazareth, recalls the four fishermen
by the Sea of Galilee, and begins his ministry of teaching and healing in
Capernaum._




Sect. 38. THE HEALING AT CANA OF THE SON OF A COURTIER OF CAPERNAUM


  John 4:46-54

  46   He came therefore again unto Cana of Galilee, where he made the
     water wine. And there was a certain [1]nobleman, whose son was
  47 sick at Capernaum. When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judea
     into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought _him_ that he would
     come down, and heal his son; for he was at the point of death.
  48 Jesus therefore said unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye
  49 will in no wise believe. The [1]nobleman saith unto him. [2]Sir,
  50 come down ere my child die. Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy
     son liveth. The man believed the word that Jesus spake unto him,
  51 and he went his way. And as he was now going down, his [3]servants
  52 met him, saying, that his son lived. So he inquired of them the
     hour when he began to amend. They said therefore unto him,
  53 Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him. So the father
     knew that _it was_ at that hour in which Jesus said unto him, Thy
  54 son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house. This is
     again the second sign that Jesus did, having come out of Judea
     into Galilee.

Sect. 39. THE FIRST REJECTION AT NAZARETH


  Luke 4:16-31

  16   And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and he
     entered, as his custom was, into the synagogue on the sabbath day,
  17 and stood up to read. And there was delivered unto him [1]the book
     of the prophet Isaiah. And he opened the [2]book, and found the
     place where it was written,
  18   The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,
       [3]Because he anointed me to preach [4]good tidings to the poor:
       He hath sent me to proclaim release to the captives,
       And recovering of sight to the blind,
       To set at liberty them that are bruised,
  19   To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord [_see Isa. 58:6;
         61:1-2_].
  20 And he closed the [2]book, and gave it back to the attendant, and
     sat down: and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on
  21 him. And he began to say unto them, To-day hath this scripture
  22 been fulfilled in your ears. And all bare him witness, and
     wondered at the words of grace which proceeded out of his mouth:
  23 and they said, Is not this Joseph's son? And he said unto them,
     Doubtless ye will say unto me this parable, Physician, heal
     thyself [_see John 6:42; 7:15_]: whatsoever we have heard done at
  24 Capernaum, do also here in thine own country. And he said, Verily
     I say unto you, No prophet is acceptable in his own country [_see
  25 John 4:44_]. But of a truth I say unto you, There were many widows
     in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up three
     years and six months, when there came a great famine over all the
  26 land [_see 1 Kings 17:1; 18:1-2_]; and unto none of them was
     Elijah sent, but only to [5]Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, unto
  27 a woman that was a widow [_see 1 Kings 17:8-9_]. And there were
     many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet; and none
     of them was cleansed, but only Naaman the Syrian [_see 2 Kings
  28 5:1-14_]. And they were all filled with wrath in the synagogue, as
  29 they heard these things; and they rose up, and cast him forth out
     of the city, and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their
  30 city was built, that they might throw him down headlong. But he
  31 passing through the midst of them went his way. And he came down
     to Capernaum, a city of Galilee.

Sect. 40. THE NEW HOME IN CAPERNAUM


  Matt. 4:13-16

  13 And leaving Nazareth,[a] he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is
  14 by the sea, in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali: that it might
     be fulfilled which was spoken [1]by Isaiah the prophet [_see Isa.
     8:23; 9:1-2_], saying,
  15   The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali,
       [2]Toward the sea, beyond Jordan,
       Galilee of the [3]Gentiles,
  16   The people which sat in darkness
       Saw a great light,
       And to them which sat in the region and shadow of death,
       To them did light spring up.

[Footnote a: Nazareth was never the Saviour's residence during his public
ministry. After the wedding at Cana he lived a short time at _Capernaum_,
and henceforth that city will be his abode, till he leaves Galilee six
months before the crucifixion--most of the time, however, being actually
spent in several journeys throughout Galilee, together with a trip to
Jerusalem, and retirement to districts around Galilee.]




Sect. 41. JESUS FINDS FOUR FISHERS OF MEN IN FOUR FISHERMEN[a]

By the Sea of Galilee, near Capernaum


  Mark 1:16-20         |Matt. 4:18-22        |Luke 5:1-11
                       |                     |
  16   And passing     |18   And walking by  | 1   Now it came to pass,
     along by the sea  |   the sea of        |   while the multitude
     of Galilee, he saw|   Galilee, he saw   |   pressed upon him and
     Simon and Andrew  |   two brethren,     |   heard the word of God,
     the brother of    |   Simon who is      |   that he was standing
     Simon casting a   |   called Peter, and |   by the lake of
     net in the sea:   |   Andrew his        | 2 Gennesaret; and he saw
     for they were     |   brother, casting a|   two boats standing by
  17 fishers. And Jesus|   net into the sea; |   the lake: but the
     said unto them,   |   for they were     |   fishermen had gone out

     fishers of men.   |   and I will make   |   one of the boats,
  18 And straightway   |   you fishers of    |   which was Simon's and
     they left the     |20 men. And they     |   asked him to put out a

  19 him. And going on |   the nets, and     |   And he sat down and
     a little further, |21 followed him. And |   taught the multitudes
     he saw James the  |   going on from     | 4 out of the boat. And
     _son_ of Zebedee, |   thence he saw     |   when he had left
     and John his      |   other two         |   speaking, he said unto
     brother, who also |   brethren, [1]James|   Simon, Put out into
     were in the boat  |   the _son_ of      |   the deep, and let down
     mending the nets. |   Zebedee, and John |   your nets for a
  20 And straightway he|   his brother, in   | 5 draught. And Simon
     called them: and  |   the boat with     |   answered and said,
     they left their   |   Zebedee their     |   Master, we toiled all
     father Zebedee in |   father, mending   |   night, and took
     the boat with the |   their nets; and he|   nothing: but at thy
     hired servants,   |22 called them. And  |   word I will let down
     and went after    |   they straightway  | 6 the nets. And when
     him.              |   left the boat and |   they had this done,
                       |   their father, and |   they inclosed a great
                       |   followed him.[a]  |   multitude of fishes;
                       |                     |   and their nets were
   7 breaking; and they beckoned unto their partners in the other boat,
     that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both
   8 the boats, so that they began to sink. But Simon Peter, when he saw
     it, fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a
   9 sinful man, O Lord. For he was amazed, and all that were with him,
  10 at the draught of the fishes which they had taken; and so were also
     James and John, sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon.
     And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt
  11 [2]catch men. And when they had brought their boats to land, they
     left all, and followed him.

     [Footnote 1: Or, _Jacob_: and so elsewhere.]

     [Footnote 2: Gr. _take alive_.]

[Footnote a: Three of these two pairs of brothers (Andrew and Peter, John
and James) had already become disciples of Jesus at Bethany beyond Jordan
(James probably soon afterwards), but now they leave their prosperous
fish business and follow Jesus continuously as many business men since
have given up a lucrative business for the ministry. They, along with
Philip and Nathaniel, had been with Jesus in the early ministry (the year
of obscurity).]




Sect. 42. THE EXCITEMENT IN THE SYNAGOGUE BECAUSE OF THE TEACHING OF
JESUS AND THE HEALING OF A DEMONIAC ON THE SABBATH


  Mark 1:21-28                     |Luke 4:31-37
                                   |

     saying, Hold thy peace, and   |   him. And when the [3]devil had

_In sections 44-52 Jesus makes his first tour of Galilee with the Four
Fishermen whom he has now called to follow him continuously. On the
return to Capernaum Matthew is called and various miracles arouse the
enthusiasm of the multitudes and the hostility of the Pharisees to
Christ's teachings._

[Footnote a: This journey about all Galilee included a _great mass_ of
teaching and healing (dwell on Matt. 4:23-25), of which only a few
specimens are recorded, and these apparently occurred at Capernaum, his
headquarters. The journey given by Luke only (8:1-3) is probably distinct
from this, and if so it would be a _second_, while that of Luke 9:1-6 (=
Mark 6:6-13 = Matt. 9:35-11:1), which is quite certainly distinct, would
then be a _third_ journey about Galilee. The reader ought to expand his
imagination and take in these extended labors.]

Sect. 49. AT A FEAST IN JERUSALEM (POSSIBLY THE PASSOVER) JESUS HEALS A
LAME MAN ON THE SABBATH AND DEFENDS THIS ACTION TO THE PHARISEES IN A
GREAT DISCOURSE


  John 5:1-47

   1   After these things there was [1]a feast[a] of the Jews; and Jesus
     went up to Jerusalem.[b]
   2   Now there is in Jerusalem by the sheep _gate_ a pool, which is
   3 called in Hebrew [2]Bethesda, having five porches. In these lay a
   5 multitude of them that were sick, blind, halt, withered[3]. And a
     certain man was there, which had been thirty and eight years in
   6 his infirmity. When Jesus saw him lying, and knew that he had been
     now a long time _in that case_, he saith unto him, Wouldst thou be
   7 made whole? The sick man answered him, [4]Sir, I have no man, when
     the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am
   8 coming, another steppeth down before me. Jesus saith unto him,
   9 Arise, take up thy bed, and walk. And straightway the man was made
     whole, and took up his bed and walked.
  10   Now it was the sabbath on that day. So the Jews said unto him
     that was cured, It is the sabbath, and it is not lawful for thee to
  11 take up thy bed [_see Ex. 20:10; Deut. 5:14_]. But he answered
     them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy
  12 bed, and walk. They asked him, Who is the man that said unto thee,
  13 Take up _thy bed_, and walk? But he that was healed wist not who
     it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in
  14 the place. Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said
     unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse
  15 thing befall thee. The man went away, and told the Jews that it
  16 was Jesus which had made him whole. And for this cause did the
     Jews persecute Jesus, because he did these things on the sabbath.
  17 But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh even until now, and I
  18 work. For this cause therefore the Jews sought the more to kill
     him, because he not only brake the sabbath, but also called God
     his own Father, making himself equal with God.
  19   Jesus therefore answered and said unto them,
       Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of
     himself, but what he seeth the Father doing: for what things soever
  20 he doeth, these the Son also doeth in like manner. For the Father
     loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and
  21 greater works than these will he shew him, that ye may marvel. For
     as the Father raiseth the dead and quickeneth them, even so the
  22 Son also quickeneth whom he will. For neither doth the Father
  23 judge any man, but he hath given all judgement unto the Son; that
     all may honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that
     honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which sent him.
  24 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and
     believeth him that sent me, hath eternal life, and cometh not into
  25 judgement, but hath passed out of death into life. Verily, verily,
     I say unto you, The hour cometh, and now is, when the dead shall
     hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that hear shall live.
  26 For as the Father hath life in himself, even so gave he to the Son
  27 also to have life in himself: and he gave him authority to execute
  28 judgement, because he is [5]the Son of man. Marvel not at this:
     for the hour cometh, in which all that are in the tombs shall hear
  29 his voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto
     the resurrection of life; and they that have [6]done ill, unto the
     resurrection of judgement.
  30   I can of myself do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgement
     is righteous; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of
  31 him that sent me. If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not
  32 true. It is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that
  33 the witness which he witnesseth of me is true. Ye have sent unto
  34 John, and he hath borne witness unto the truth. But the witness
     which I receive is not from man: howbeit I say these things, that
  35 ye may be saved. He was the lamp that burneth and shineth: and ye
  36 were willing to rejoice for a season in his light. But the witness
     which I have is greater than _that of_ John: for the works which
     the Father hath given me to accomplish, the very works that I do,
  37 bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me. And the Father
     which sent me, he hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard
  38 his voice at any time, nor seen his form. And ye have not his word
  39 abiding in you: for whom he sent, him ye believe not. [7]Ye search
     the scriptures, because ye think that in them ye have eternal
  40 life; and these are they which bear witness of me; and ye will not
  41 come to me, that ye may have life. I receive not glory from men.
  42 But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in yourselves. I
  43 am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another
  44 shall come in his own name, him ye will receive. How can ye
     believe, which receive glory one of another, and the glory that
  45 _cometh_ from [8]the only God ye seek not? Think not that I will
     accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, _even_
  46 Moses, on whom ye have set your hope. For if ye believed Moses, ye
  47 would believe me; for he wrote of me. But if ye believe not his
     writings, how shall ye believe my words?[c]

     [Footnote 1: Many ancient authorities read _the feast_.]

     [Footnote 2: Some ancient authorities read _Bethsaida_, others
     _Bethzatha_.]

     [Footnote 3: Many ancient authorities insert, wholly or in part,
     _waiting for the moving of the water: 4 for an angel of the Lord
     went down at certain seasons into the pool, and troubled the
     water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water
     stepped in was made whole, with whatsoever disease he was
     holden._]

     [Footnote 7: Or, _Search the scriptures_.]

     [Footnote 8: Some ancient authorities read _the only one_.]

[Footnote a: This feast of John 5:1 was _most probably_ a Passover (see
note at end of volume, note 7). If so, we should know that our Lord's
public ministry lasted three years and a fraction, and that the great
ministry in Galilee lasted some 18 to 20 months. Otherwise, we should
know of only two years and a fraction for the former, and 6 to 8 months
for the latter; as John gives three passovers beyond question (John 2:13;
6:4; 12:1), and our Lord's ministry began some time before the first of
these. If the feast of 5:1 was not a passover, it is quite impossible to
determine what other feast it was. While one would be glad to settle
these questions, if it were possible, yet it really does not matter as
regards understanding our Lord's _recorded_ history and teachings during
the great ministry in Galilee, the only point of difference being that if
this feast was a Passover (or if there is an unmentioned Passover) we
should conceive of the three journeys about Galilee as occupying a longer
time, and including more extensive _unrecorded_ labors in preaching and
healing.]

[Footnote b: It is to be noted that John's Gospel gives the Jerusalem
Ministry of Jesus almost entirely except Galilee in ch. 2, Samaria and
Galilee in ch. 4, Galilee in ch. 6 and again in ch. 21. It seems clear
that John wrote with full knowledge of the Synoptic Gospels and
supplements them at certain points. Both Luke and John were thus critics
of the Gospel records.]

[Footnote c: Observe that here more than a year before the crucifixion,
and probably two years (_i.e._ if the feast of 5:1 was a passover or if
an unnamed passover is granted), the hostility of the Jews _at Jerusalem_
(comp. John 4:1) has reached the point of a desire to kill him, as a
sabbath breaker and a blasphemer (5:16-18). So we shall find him staying
away from Jerusalem at the passover of John 6:4, and until the
Tabernacles six months before the crucifixion (John 7:1-10). Meantime,
the hostility will go on increasing in other parts of the country (Mark
3:6, etc.).--Notice also that in this discourse at Jerusalem our Lord
repeatedly declares himself in a high sense the Son of God, and the
appointed judge of mankind (ver. 27), and says that Moses wrote
concerning him (ver. 46). All this indicated that he was the Messiah, but
he did not here expressly assert it as he did in Samaria (John 4:26).
That would have precipitated the collision, for to claim to be the
Messiah would in the view of the Jewish rulers involve _political_
consequences. Comp. John 11:48.]




Sect. 50. ANOTHER SABBATH CONTROVERSY WITH THE PHARISEES WHEN THE

[Footnote b: Note the five arguments made by Jesus in defence of the
conduct of the disciples on the Sabbath (the historical appeal in the
conduct of David, the appeal to the law about the temple service, the
voice of prophecy, the purpose of God in the Sabbath, and the lordship of
the Messiah over the Sabbath). Jesus had already (John 5:17) argued that
he was equal to the Father and hence had the right to do certain things
(acts of mercy) on the Sabbath.]

Pharisees concerning Sabbath observance (John 9:1-34; Luke 13:10-21;

another argument (circumcision on the Sabbath) for his conduct on the
Sabbath.]

a plot to kill him, as some had wished to do in Jerusalem (comp. on Sect.

_Matthew, chapters 5-7. Luke 6:17-49._[a]

A level place on a mountain, not far from Capernaum

[Footnote a: There is little doubt that the discourses given by Matthew
and Luke are the same, Matthew locating it on "the mountain," and Luke
"on a level place," which might easily be a level spot on a mountain.
(See note at end of this book, note 9.) Observe that they begin and end
alike, and pursue the same general order. Luke omits various matters of
special interest to Matthew's Jewish readers (_e.g._ Matt. 5:17-42), and
other matters that he himself will give elsewhere (_e.g._ Luke 11:1-4;
12:22-31); while Luke has a few sentences (as ver. 24-26, 38-40), which
are not given by Matthew.]

     persecuted for righteousness'  |25 your consolation. Woe unto you,
     sake: for theirs is the kingdom|   ye that are full now! for ye
  11 of heaven. Blessed are ye when |   shall hunger. Woe _unto you_,
     _men_ shall reproach you, and  |   ye that laugh now! for ye shall
     persecute you, and say all     |26 mourn and weep. Woe _unto you_,
     manner of evil against you     |   when all men shall speak well
  12 falsely, for my sake. Rejoice, |   of you! for in the same manner
     and be exceeding glad: for     |   did their fathers to the false
     great is your reward in heaven:|   prophets.
     for so persecuted they the     |
     prophets which were before you.|

_2. The Theme of the Sermon: Christ's Standard of Righteousness in
Contrast with that of the Scribes and Pharisees_


  Matt. 5:13-20

  13   Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost its
     savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for
     nothing, but to be cast out and trodden under foot of men [_see
  14 Mark 9:50; Jesus often repeated his sayings_]. Ye are the light of
  15 the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hid. Neither do _men_
     light a lamp, and put it under the bushel, but on the stand; and
     it shineth unto all that are in the house [_see Mark 4:21; Luke
  16 8:16_]. Even so let your light shine before men, that they may see
     your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.
  17   Think not that I came to destroy the law or the prophets: I came
  18 not to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, Till
     heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise
  19 pass away from the law, till all things be accomplished. Whosoever
     therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall
     teach men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven: but
     whosoever shall do and teach them, he shall be called great in the
  20 kingdom of heaven. For I say unto you, that except your
     righteousness shall exceed _the righteousness_ of the scribes and
     Pharisees, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven.


_3. Christ's Ethical Teaching Superior to that of the Scribes (both the
Old Testament and the Oral Law) in Six Items or Illustrations (Murder,
Adultery, Divorce, Oaths, Retaliation, Love of Enemies)_


  Matt. 5:21-48

  21   Ye have heard that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt
     not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the
  22 judgement [_see Ex. 20:13; Deut. 5:17_]: but I say unto you, that
     every one who is angry with his brother[1] shall be in danger of
     the judgement; and whosoever shall say to his brother, [2]Raca,
     shall be in danger of the council; and whosoever shall say, [3]Thou
  23 fool, shall be in danger [4]of the [5]hell of fire. If therefore
     thou art offering thy gift at the altar, and there rememberest
  24 that thy brother hath aught against thee, leave there thy gift
     before the altar, and go thy way, first be reconciled to thy
  25 brother, and then come and offer thy gift. Agree with thine
     adversary quickly, whiles thou art with him in the way; lest haply
     the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge [6]deliver
  26 thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison. Verily I say
     unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou have
     paid the last farthing.
  27   Ye have heard that it was said, Thou shalt not commit adultery
  28 [_see Ex. 20:14; Deut. 5:18_]: but I say unto you, that every one
     that looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery
  29 with her already in his heart. And if thy right eye causeth thee
     to stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is
     profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not
  30 thy whole body be cast into [7]hell. And if thy right hand causeth
     thee to stumble, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is
     profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not
  31 thy whole body go into [7]hell. It was said also, Whosoever shall
     put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement [_see
  32 Deut. 24:1_]: but I say unto you, that every one that putteth away
     his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, maketh her an
     adulteress: and whosoever shall marry her when she is put away
     committeth adultery.[a]
  33   Again, ye have heard that it was said to them of old time, Thou
     shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine
     oaths [_see Lev. 19:12; Num. 30:2; Ex. 20:7; Deut. 5:11; 23:21_]:
  34 but I say unto you, Swear not at all [_see Matt. 26:63-64_];
  35 neither by the heaven, for it is the throne of God; nor by the
     earth, for it is the footstool of his feet; nor [8]by Jerusalem,
  36 for it is the city of the great King [_see Isa. 66:1_]. Neither
     shalt thou swear by thy head, for thou canst not make one hair
  37 white or black [_see Ps. 48:2_]. [9]But let your speech be, Yea,
     yea; Nay, nay: and whatsoever is more than these is of [10]the
     evil _one_.
  38   Ye have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth
  39 for a tooth [_see Ex. 21:24; Lev. 24:20; Deut. 19:21_]: but I say
     unto you, Resist not [11]him that is evil: but whosoever smiteth
     thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also [_see John
  40 18:23_]. And if any man would go to law with thee, and take away
  41 the coat, let him have thy cloke also. And whosoever shall
  42 [12]compel thee to go one mile, go with him twain. Give to him that
     asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou
     away.
  43   Ye have heard that it was said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour
     [_see Lev. 19:18; Deut. 23:6; 25:19_], and hate thine enemy:

                                    |Luke 6:27-30, 32-36
                                    |
  44 but I say unto you [_see Luke  |27 But I say unto you which hear,
     23:34_], Love your enemies, and|   Love your enemies, do good to
     pray for them that persecute   |28 them that hate you, bless them
  45 you; that ye may be sons of    |   that curse you, pray for them
     your Father which is in heaven:|29 that despitefully use you. To
     for he maketh his sun to rise  |   him that smiteth thee on the
     on the evil and the good, and  |   _one_ cheek offer also the
     sendeth rain on the just and   |   other; and from him that taketh
     the unjust.                    |   away thy cloke withhold not thy
                                    |30 coat also. Give to every one
                                    |   that asketh thee; and of him
                                    |   that taketh away thy goods ask
  46             For if ye love them|32 them not again. And if ye love
     that love you, what reward have|   them that love you, what thank
     ye? do not even the            |   have ye? for even sinners love
  47 [13]publicans the same? And if |33 those that love them. And if ye
     ye salute your brethren only,  |   do good to them that do good to
     what do ye more _than others_? |   you, what thank have ye? for
     do not even the Gentiles the   |34 even sinners do the same. And
  48 same? Ye therefore shall be    |   if ye lend to them of whom ye
     perfect, as your heavenly      |   hope to receive, what thank
     Father is perfect.             |   have ye? even sinners lend to
                                    |   sinners, to receive again as
                                    |35 much. But love your enemies,
                                    |   and do _them_ good, and lend,
                                    |   [14]never despairing; and your
                                    |   reward shall be great, and ye
                                    |   shall be sons of the Most High:
                                    |   for he is kind toward the
                                    |36 unthankful and evil. Be ye
                                    |   merciful, even as your Father
                                    |   is merciful.

_4. The Practice of Real Righteousness unlike the Ostentatious Hypocrisy
of the Pharisees, as in Almsgiving, Prayer, Fasting_


  Matt. 6:1-18

   1   Take heed that ye do not your righteousness before men, to be
     seen of them: else ye have no reward with your Father which is in
     heaven.
   2   When therefore thou doest alms, sound not a trumpet before thee,
     as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that
     they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have
   3 received their reward. But when thou doest alms, let not thy left
   4 hand know what thy right hand doeth: that thine alms may be in
     secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret shall recompense
     thee.
   5   And when ye pray, ye shall not be as the hypocrites: for they
     love to stand and pray in the synagogues and in the corners of the
     streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They
   6 have received their reward. But thou, when thou prayest, enter
     into thine inner chamber, and having shut thy door, pray to thy
     Father which is in secret, and thy Father which seeth in secret
   7 shall recompense thee. And in praying use not vain repetitions, as
     the Gentiles do: for they think that they shall be heard for their
   8 much speaking. Be not therefore like unto them: for [1]your Father
   9 knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him. After this
     manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed
  10 by thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so
  11 on earth. Give us this day [2]our daily bread. And forgive us our
  12 debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And bring us not into
  13 temptation, but deliver us from [3]the evil _one_.[4] For if ye
  14 forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also
  15 forgive you. But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither
     will your Father forgive your trespasses.
  16   Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad
     countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may be seen
     of men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have received their
  17 reward. But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thy head, and wash thy
  18 face; that thou be not seen of men to fast, but of thy Father
     which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall
     recompense thee.

     [Footnote 1: Some ancient authorities read _God your Father_.]

     [Footnote 2: Gr. _our bread for the coming day_.]

     [Footnote 3: Or, _evil_.]

     [Footnote 4: Many authorities, some ancient, but with variations,
     add _For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for
     ever. Amen._]


_5. Single-hearted Devotion to God, as Opposed to Worldly Aims and
Anxieties_


  Matt. 6:19-34

  19   Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon the earth, where moth
     and rust doth consume, and where thieves [1]break through and
  20 steal: but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither
     moth nor rust doth consume, and where thieves do not [1]break
  21 through nor steal: for where thy treasure is, there will thy heart
  22 be also. The lamp of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be
  23 single, thy whole body shall be full of light. But if thine eye be
     evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the
  24 light that is in thee be darkness, how great is the darkness! No
     man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and
     love the other; or else he will hold to one, and despise the
  25 other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. Therefore I say unto you,
     Be not anxious for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall
     drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the
  26 life more than the food, and the body than the raiment? Behold
     the birds of the heaven, that they sow not, neither do they reap,
     nor gather into barns; and your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are
  27 not ye of much more value than they? And which of you by being
  28 anxious can add one cubit unto his [2]stature? And why are ye
     anxious concerning raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how
  29 they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: yet I say unto
     you, that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one
  30 of these. But if God doth so clothe the grass of the field, which
     to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven, _shall he_ not
  31 much more _clothe_ you, O ye of little faith? Be not therefore
     anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or,
  32 Wherewithal shall we be clothed? For after all these things do the
     Gentiles seek; for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need
  33 of all these things. But seek ye first his kingdom, and his
  34 righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you. Be
     not therefore anxious for the morrow: for the morrow will be
     anxious for itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.

_6. Captious Criticism, or Judging Others_


  Matt. 7:1-6                       |Luke 6:37-42
                                    |
   1   Judge not, that ye be not    |37 And judge not, and ye shall not
   2 judged. For with what judgement|   be judged: and condemn not, and
     ye judge, ye shall be judged:  |   ye shall not be condemned:
     and with what measure ye mete, |   release, and ye shall be
     it shall be measured unto you. |38 released: give, and it shall be
                                    |   given unto you; good measure,
                                    |   pressed down, shaken together,
                                    |   running over, shall they give
                                    |   into your bosom. For with what
                                    |   measure ye mete it shall be
                                    |   measured to you again.
                                    |39   And he spake also a parable
                                    |   unto them, Can the blind guide
                                    |   the blind? shall they not both
                                    |40 fall into a pit? The disciple
                                    |   is not above his [1]master: but
                                    |   every one when he is perfected
                                    |41 shall be as his [1]master. And
   3 And why beholdest thou the     |   why beholdest thou the mote
     mote that is in thy brother's  |   that is in thy brother's eye,
     eye, but considerest not the   |   but considerest not the beam
     beam that is in thine own eye? |42 that is in thine own eye? Or
   4 Or how wilt thou say to thy    |   how canst thou say to thy
     brother, Let me cast out the   |   brother, Brother, let me cast
     mote out of thine eye; and lo, |   out the mote that is in thine

   6   Give not that which is holy  |   cast out the mote that is in
     unto the dogs, neither cast    |   thy brother's eye.
     your pearls before the swine,  |
     lest haply they trample them   |
     under their feet, and turn and |
     rend you.                      |

_7. Prayer, and the Golden Rule_


  Matt. 7:7-12

   7   Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock,
   8 and it shall be opened unto you: for every one that asketh
     receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh
   9 it shall be opened. Or what man is there of you, who, if his son
  10 shall ask him for a loaf, will give him a stone; or if he shall
  11 ask for a fish, will give him a serpent? If ye then, being evil,
     know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall
     your Father which is in heaven |
     give good things to them that  |
  12 ask him? All things therefore  |Luke 6:31
     whatsoever ye would that men   |
     should do unto you, even so do |31   And as ye would that men
     ye also unto them: for this is |   should do to you, do ye also to
     the law and the prophets.      |   them likewise.


_8. The Conclusion of the Sermon. The Lesson of Personal Righteousness
Driven Home by Powerful Parables_


  Matt. 7:13 to 8:1

  13   Enter ye in by the narrow gate: for wide [1]is the gate, and
     broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many be they
  14 that enter in thereby. [2]For narrow is the gate, and straitened
     the way, that leadeth unto life, and few be they that find it.
  15   Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing,
  16 but inwardly are ravening wolves. By their fruits ye shall know
  17 them. Do _men_ gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? Even
     so every good tree bringeth    |
     forth good fruit: but the      |Luke 6:43-49
     corrupt tree bringeth forth    |
  18 evil fruit. A good tree cannot |43   For there is no good tree that
     bring forth evil fruit, neither|   bringeth forth corrupt fruit;
     can a corrupt tree bring forth |   nor again a corrupt tree that
  19 good fruit. Every tree that    |44 bringeth forth good fruit. For
     bringeth not forth good fruit  |   each tree is known by its own
     is hewn down, and cast into the|   fruit. For of thorns men do not
  20 fire. Therefore by their fruits|   gather figs, nor of a bramble
  21 ye shall know them. Not every  |45 bush gather they grapes. The
     one that saith unto me, Lord,  |   good man out of the good
     Lord, shall enter the kingdom  |   treasure of his heart bringeth
     of heaven; but he that doeth   |   forth that which is good; and
     the will of my Father which is |   the evil _man_ out of the evil
  22 in heaven. Many will say to me |   _treasure_ bringeth forth that
     in that day, Lord, Lord, did we|   which is evil: for out of the
     not prophesy by thy name, and  |   abundance of the heart his mouth
     by thy name cast out [3]devils,|   speaketh.
     and by thy name do many        |46   And why call ye me, Lord,
  23 [4]mighty works? And then will |   Lord, and do not the things
     I profess unto them, I never   |   which I say?
     knew you: depart from me, ye   |
  24 that work iniquity. Every one  |47   Every one that cometh unto me,
     therefore which heareth these  |   and heareth my words, and doeth
     words of mine, and doeth them, |   them, I will shew you to whom
     shall be likened unto a wise   |48 he is like: he is like a man
     man, which built his house upon|   building a house, who digged
  25 the rock: and the rain         |   and went deep, and laid a

     not: for it was founded upon   |   could not shake it: [5]because
  26 the rock. And every one that   |49 it had been well builded. But

     house; and it fell: and great  |
     was the fall thereof.          |
  28   And it came to pass, when Jesus ended these words, the multitudes
  29 were astonished at his teaching: for he taught them as _one_
     having authority, and not as their scribes.
   1   And when he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes
     followed him.

Sect. 55. JESUS HEALS A CENTURION'S SERVANT AT CAPERNAUM


  Matt. 8:5-13                      |Luke 7:1-10
                                    |
   5   And when he was entered into | 1   After he had ended all his
     Capernaum, there came unto him |   sayings in the ears of the
     a centurion,                   |   people, he entered into
                                    |   Capernaum.
                                    | 2   And a certain centurion's
                                    |   [5]servant, who was [8]dear
                                    |   unto him, was sick and at the
                                    | 3 point of death. And when he
                                    |   heard concerning Jesus, he sent
                                    |   unto him elders of the Jews,
                   beseeching him,  |   asking him that he would come
   6 and saying, Lord, my [1]servant| 4 and save his [5]servant. And
     lieth in the house sick of the |   they, when they came to Jesus,
     palsy, grievously tormented.   |   besought him earnestly, saying,
                                    |   He is worthy that thou shouldest
                                    | 5 do this for him: for he loveth
                                    |   our nation, and himself built
   7 And he saith unto him, I will  | 6 us our synagogue. And Jesus
     come and heal him.             |   went with them. And when he was
                                    |   now not far from the house, the
                                    |   centurion sent friends to him,
   8 And the centurion answered     |   saying unto him, Lord, trouble
     and said, Lord, I am not       |   not thyself: for I am not
     [2]worthy that thou shouldest  |   [2]worthy that thou shouldest
     come under my roof: but only   | 7 come under my roof: wherefore
     say [3]the word, and my        |   neither thought I myself worthy
     [1]servant shall be healed.    |   to come unto thee: but say
                                    |   [3]the word, and my [1]servant
                                    | 8 shall be healed. For I also am
   9 For I also am a man [4]under   |   a man set under authority,
     authority, having under myself |   having under myself soldiers:
     soldiers: and I say to this    |   and I say to this one, Go, and
     one, Go, and he goeth; and to  |   he goeth; and to another, Come,
     another, Come, and he cometh;  |   and he cometh; and to my
     and to my [5]servant, Do this, |   [5]servant, Do this, and he
  10 and he doeth it. And when Jesus| 9 doeth it. And when Jesus heard
     heard it, he marvelled, and    |   these things, he marvelled at
     said to them that followed,    |   him, and turned and said unto
     Verily I say unto you, [6]I    |   the multitude that followed
     have not found so great faith, |   him, I say unto you, I have not
  11 no, not in Israel. And I say   |   found so great faith, no, not
     unto you, that many shall come |   in Israel.
     from the east and the west, and|
     shall [7]sit down with Abraham,|
     and Isaac, and Jacob, in the   |
     kingdom of heaven [_see Ps.    |
  12 107:3; Isa. 49:12_]: but the   |

     cast forth into the outer      |
     darkness: there shall be       |
     weeping and gnashing of teeth. |
  13 And Jesus said unto the        |
     centurion, Go thy way; as thou |
     hast believed _so_ be it done  |10           And they that were
     unto thee. And the [1]servant  |   sent, returning to the house,

Sect. 56. HE RAISES A WIDOW'S SON AT NAIN


  Luke 7:11-17

  11   And it came to pass [1]soon afterwards, that he went to a city
     called Nain; and his disciples went with him, and a great
  12 multitude. Now when he drew near to the gate of the city, behold,
     there was carried out one that was dead, the only son of his
     mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with
  13 her. And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said
  14 unto her, Weep not. And he came nigh and touched the bier: and the
     bearers stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee,
  15 Arise. And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he
  16 gave him to his mother. And fear took hold on all: and they
     glorified God, saying, A great prophet is arisen among us: and,
  17 God hath visited his people. And this report went forth concerning
     him in the whole of Judea, and the region round about.

Sect. 57. THE MESSAGE[a] FROM THE BAPTIST AND THE EULOGY OF JESUS

Galilee


  Matt. 11:2-19                     |Luke 7:18-35
                                    |
   2   Now when John heard in the   |18   And the disciples of John told
     prison[b] the works of the     |19 him of all these things. And
     Christ, he sent by his         |   John calling unto him [10]two
   3 disciples, and said unto him,  |   of his disciples sent them to
     Art thou he that cometh, or    |   the Lord, saying, Art thou he
   4 look we for another?           |   that cometh, or look we for
                                    |20 another? And when the men were
                                    |   come unto him, they said, John
                                    |   the Baptist hath sent us unto
                                    |   thee, saying, Art thou he that
                                    |   cometh, or look we for another?
                                    |21 In that hour he cured many of
                                    |   diseases and [11]plagues and
                                    |   evil spirits; and on many that
                          And Jesus |   were blind he bestowed sight.
     answered and said unto them, Go|22 And he answered and said unto
     your way and tell John the     |   them, Go your way, and tell
     things which ye do hear and    |   John what things ye have seen
   5 see: the blind receive their   |   and heard [_see Isa. 29:18-19;
     sight, and the lame walk, the  |   35:5-6; 61:1_]; the blind
     lepers are cleansed, and the   |   receive their sight, the lame
     deaf hear, and the dead are    |   walk, the lepers are cleansed,
     raised up, and the poor have   |   and the deaf hear, the dead are
     [1]good tidings preached to    |   raised up, the poor have
   6 them. And blessed is he,       |   [1]good tidings preached to
     whosoever shall find none      |23 them. And blessed is he,
     occasion of stumbling in me.   |   whosoever shall find none
                                    |   occasion of stumbling in me.
   7   And as these went their way, |24   And when the messengers of
     Jesus began to say unto the    |   John were departed, he began to
     multitudes concerning John,    |   say unto the multitudes
     What went ye out into the      |   concerning John, What went ye
     wilderness to behold? a reed   |   out into the wilderness to

   9 [2]But wherefore went ye out?  |   delicately, are in kings'
     to see a prophet? Yea, I say   |26 courts. But what went ye out to
     unto you, and much more than a |   see? a prophet? Yea, I say unto
  10 prophet. This is he, of whom it|   you, and much more than a
     is written,                    |27 prophet. This is he of whom it

  11 Verily I say unto you, Among   |       before thee [_see Mal.
     them that are born of women    |       3:1_].
     there hath not arisen a greater|28 I say unto you, Among them that
     than John the Baptist: yet he  |   are born of women there is none
     that is [3]but little in the   |   greater than John: yet he that
     kingdom of heaven is greater   |   is [3]but little in the kingdom
  12 than he. And from the days of  |   of God is greater than he.
     John the Baptist until now the |
     kingdom of heaven suffereth    |
     violence, and men of violence  |
     take it by force [_see Luke    |
  13 16:17_]. For all the prophets  |
     and the law prophesied until   |
  14 John. And if ye are willing to |
     receive [4]it, this is Elijah, |
     which is to come [_see Mal.    |
  15 4:5_]. He that hath ears [5]to |
     hear, let him hear.            |
                                    |29                            And

                                    |   God, [12]being baptized with
                                    |30 the baptism of John. But the
                                    |   Pharisees and the lawyers
                                    |   rejected for themselves the
                                    |   counsel of God, [13]being not
                                    |31 baptized of him. Whereunto then
  16 But whereunto shall I liken    |   shall I liken the men of this
     this generation? It is like[c] |   generation, and to what are
     unto children sitting in the   |32 they like? They are like unto
     marketplaces, which call unto  |   children that sit in the
  17 their fellows, and say, We     |   marketplace, and call one to
     piped unto you, and ye did not |   another; which say, We piped
     dance; we wailed, and ye did   |   unto you, and ye did not dance;
  18 not [6]mourn.                  |   we wailed, and ye did not weep.
                   For John came    |33 For John the Baptist is come
     neither eating nor drinking,   |   eating no bread nor drinking

Sect. 58. WOES UPON THE CITIES OF OPPORTUNITY. THE CLAIMS OF CHRIST AS
THE TEACHER ABOUT THE FATHER.

Galilee


  Matt. 11:20-30

  20   Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his [1]mighty
  21 works were done, because they repented not. Woe unto thee,
     Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the [1]mighty works had
     been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would
  22 have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. Howbeit I say unto
     you, it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of
  23 judgement, than for you [_see Isa. 14:13-15_]. And thou,
     Capernaum, shalt thou be exalted unto heaven? thou shalt [2]go
     down unto Hades: for if the [1]mighty works had been done in Sodom
     which were done in thee, it would have remained until this day.
  24 Howbeit I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable for the
     land of Sodom in the day of judgement, than for thee [_see Gen.
     19:24_].
  25   At that season Jesus answered and said, I [3]thank thee, O Father
     [_see John 3:35; 17:2_], Lord of heaven and earth, that thou didst
     hide these things from the wise and understanding, and didst
  26 reveal them unto babes: yea, Father, [4]for so it was
  27 well-pleasing in thy sight. All things have been delivered unto me
     of my Father: and no one knoweth the Son, save the Father; neither
     doth any know the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the
  28 Son willeth to reveal _him_. Come unto me, all ye that labour and
  29 are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke[a] upon
     you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye
  30 shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my
     burden is light [_see Jer. 6:16; Sirach 51:23_].

Sect. 59. THE ANOINTING[a] OF CHRIST'S FEET BY A SINFUL WOMAN IN THE
HOUSE OF SIMON A PHARISEE. THE PARABLE OF THE TWO DEBTORS

Galilee


  Luke 7:36-50

  36   And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him.
     And he entered into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat.
  37 And behold, a woman which was in the city, a sinner; and when she
     knew that he was sitting at meat in the Pharisee's house, she
  38 brought [1]an alabaster cruse of ointment, and standing behind at
     his feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears, and
     wiped them with the hair of her head, and [2]kissed his feet, and
  39 anointed them with the ointment. Now when the Pharisee which had
     bidden him saw it, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if
     he were [3]a prophet, would have perceived who and what manner of
  40 woman this is which toucheth him, that she is a sinner. And Jesus
     answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee.
  41 And he saith, [4]Master, say on. A certain lender had two debtors:
  42 the one owed five hundred [5]pence, and the other fifty. When they
     had not _wherewith_ to pay, he forgave them both. Which of them
  43 therefore will love him most? Simon answered and said, He, I
     suppose, to whom he forgave the most. And he said unto him, Thou
  44 hast rightly judged. And turning to the woman, he said unto Simon,
     Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me
     no water for my feet: but she hath wetted my feet with her tears,
  45 and wiped them with her hair. Thou gavest me no kiss: but she,
  46 since the time I came in, hath not ceased to [6]kiss my feet. My
     head with oil thou didst not anoint: but she hath anointed my feet
  47 with ointment. Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are
     many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is
  48 forgiven, _the same_ loveth little. And he said unto her, Thy sins
  49 are forgiven. And they that sat at meat with him began to say
  50 [7]within themselves, Who is this that even forgiveth sins? And he
     said unto the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.

[Footnote a: This anointing in Galilee must be distinct from the
anointing at Bethany, near Jerusalem, more than a year later. This sinful
and penitent woman is represented by a very late tradition as being Mary
Magdalene, and hence all the popular uses of the term Magdalen. But that
notion has no historical support whatever, and it becomes violently
improbable when we find that in the very next paragraph Luke introduces
Mary Magdalene as a new figure in the history. Some men even identify
Mary of Bethany with this woman that was a sinner and also with Mary
Magdalene, a medley of medieval mysticism.]




_In sections 60 to 63 Jesus makes a second (three in all) tour of
Galilee, this time with all the Twelve. Intense hostility of the
Pharisees is aroused by the work. They make the blasphemous accusation
that Jesus is in league with Satan. Even the kindred of Jesus fear that
he is beside himself because of the excitement and the charges._




Sect. 60. THE SECOND TOUR OF GALILEE


  Luke 8:1-3

   1   And it came to pass soon afterwards, that he went about through
     cities and villages, preaching and bringing the [1]good tidings of
   2 the kingdom of God, and with him the twelve, and certain women
     which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary that
   3 was called Magdalene, from whom seven [2]devils had gone out, and
     Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many
     others, which ministered unto [3]them of their substance.

     [Footnote 3: Many ancient authorities read _him_.]




_Notice that the events of Sects. 61-66 all occurred on the same day,
called the Busy Day._[a]

[Footnote a: This "Busy Day" is just one of many such days in the
Master's Ministry. See, for instance, the last day of his public ministry
in the temple in Jerusalem. Observe Jesus in the _forenoon_ teaching a
crowded audience (Mark 3:19), some of whom insult and blaspheme him, and
others demand a sign, and at length his mother and brethren try to carry
him off as insane (comp. Mark 3:21); in the _afternoon_ giving a group of
most remarkable parables, several of which he interprets; towards night
crossing the Lake in a boat, so tired and worn that he sleeps soundly
amid the alarming storm; then healing the Gadarene demoniacs, and
returning by boat, apparently the same evening. What a day of toil and
trial.]




Sect. 61. BLASPHEMOUS ACCUSATION OF LEAGUE WITH BEELZEBUB

Galilee


  Mark 3:19-30                      |Matt. 12:22-37
                                    |
  19   And he cometh into a house.  |
  20 And the multitude cometh       |
     together again, so that they   |
     could not so much as eat bread.|
  21 And when his friends heard it, |
     they went out to lay hold on   |
     him: for they said, He is      |
     beside himself.                |
                                    |22   Then was brought unto him
                                    |   [1]one possessed with a devil,
  22 And the scribes which came     |   blind and dumb: and he healed
     down from Jerusalem said, He   |   him, insomuch that the dumb man
     hath Beelzebub, and, [3]By the |23 spake and saw. And all the
     prince of the [2]devils casteth|   multitudes were amazed, and
  23 he out the [2]devils. And he   |   said, Is this the son of David?
     called them unto him, and said |24 But when the Pharisees heard
     unto them in parables, How can |   it, they said, This man doth
  24 Satan cast out Satan? And if a |   cast out [2]devils, but [3]by
     kingdom be divided against     |   Beelzebub the prince of the
     itself, that kingdom cannot    |   [2]devils [_see John 7:20;
  25 stand. And if a house be       |25 8:48, 52; 10:20_].[a] And
     divided against itself, that   |   knowing their thoughts he said
     house will not be able to      |   unto them, Every kingdom
  26 stand. And if Satan hath risen |   divided against itself is
     up against himself, and is     |   brought to desolation; and
     divided, he cannot stand, but  |   every city or house divided
     hath an end.                   |   against itself shall not stand:
                                    |26 and if Satan casteth out Satan,
                                    |   he is divided against himself;
                                    |   how then shall his kingdom
                                    |27 stand? And if I [3]by Beelzebub
                                    |   cast out [2]devils, [3]by whom
                                    |   do your sons cast them out?
  27              But no one can    |   therefore shall they be your

     blaspheme against the Holy     |   [4]unto men; but the blasphemy
     Spirit hath never forgiveness, |   against the Spirit shall not be

                                    |   but whosoever shall speak
                                    |   against the Holy Spirit, it
                                    |   shall not be forgiven him,
  33 neither in this [5]world, nor in that which is to come. Either make
     the tree good, and its fruit good; or make the tree corrupt, and
  34 its fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by its fruit. Ye offspring
     of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of
  35 the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. The good man out of
     his good treasure bringeth forth good things: and the evil man
  36 out of his evil treasure bringeth forth evil things. And I say unto
     you, that every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give
  37 account thereof in the day of judgement. For by thy words thou
     shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.

Sect. 62. SCRIBES AND PHARISEES DEMAND A SIGN

Same day. Galilee


  Matt. 12:38-45

  38   Then certain of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying,
  39 [1]Master, we would see a sign from thee. But he answered and said
     unto them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign;
     and there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of Jonah the
  40 prophet: for as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly
     of the [2]whale; so shall the Son of man be three days and three
     nights in the heart of the earth [_see Jonah 1:17; 2:1-2; 3:5;
  41 4:3; 1 Kings 10:1-10_]. The men of Nineveh shall stand up in the
     judgement with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they
     repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, [3]a greater than
  42 Jonah is here. The queen of the south shall rise up in the
     judgement with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came
     from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and
  43 behold, [3]a greater than Solomon is here. But the unclean spirit,
     when [4]he is gone out of the man, passeth through waterless
  44 places, seeking rest, and findeth it not. Then [4]he saith, I will
     return into my house whence I came out; and when [4]he is come,
  45 [4]he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished. Then goeth [4]he,
     and taketh with [5]himself seven other spirits more evil than
     [5]himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state
     of that man becometh worse than the first. Even so shall it be
     also unto this evil generation.

     like manner are they|     And understand with their heart,
     that are sown upon  |     And should turn again,
                         |     And I should heal them [_see Isa.
                         |       6:9-10_].
  16 But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they
  17 hear. For verily I say unto you, that many prophets and righteous
     men desired to see the things which ye see, and saw them not; and
  18 to hear the things which ye hear, and heard them not. Hear then ye
  19 the parable of the sower. When any one heareth the word of the
     kingdom, and understandeth it not, _then_ cometh the evil _one_,
     and snatcheth away that which hath been sown in his heart. This is
                         |   he that was sown by |
                         |20 the way side. And   |
                         |   he that was sown    |13         And those
     the rocky _places_, |   upon the rocky      |   on the rock _are_
     who, when they have |   places, this is he  |   they which, when
     heard the word,     |   that heareth the    |   they have heard,
                         |   word, and           |   receive the word
     straightway receive |   straightway with joy|   with joy; and
  17 it with joy; and    |21 receiveth it; yet   |   these have no
     they have no root in|   hath he not root in |   root, which for a
     themselves, but     |   himself, but        |   while believe, and
     endure for a while; |   endureth for a      |   in time of

     tribulation or      |   tribulation or      |   away.

     are they that are   |   that was sown among |   which fell among
     sown among the      |   the thorns, this is |   the thorns, these
     thorns; these are   |   he that heareth the |   are they that have
     they that have heard|                       |

  21   And he said unto them, Is the |16   And no man, when he hath
     lamp[b] brought to be put under |   lighted a lamp, covereth it
     the bushel, or under the bed,   |   with a vessel, or putteth it
     _and_ not to be put on the      |   under a bed; but putteth it on
  22 stand? For there is nothing hid,|   a stand, that they which enter
     save that it should be          |17 in may see the light. For
     manifested; neither was         |   nothing is hid, that shall not
     _anything_ made secret, but that|   be made manifest; nor
  23 it should come to light. If any |   _anything_ secret, that shall
     man hath ears to hear, let him  |   not be known and come to light.
  24 hear. And he said unto them,    |
     Take heed what ye hear: with    |18 Take heed therefore how ye
     what measure ye mete it shall be|   hear: for whosoever hath, to
     measured unto you: and more     |   him shall be given; and
  25 shall be given unto you. For he |   whosoever hath not, from him
     that hath, to him shall be      |   shall be taken away even that
     given: and he that hath not,    |   which he [3]thinketh he hath.
     from him shall be taken away    |
     even that which he hath.        |

  (b) Parable of the Seed Growing of Itself

  Mark 4:26-29

  26   And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast
  27 seed upon the earth; and should sleep and rise night and day, and
  28 the seed should spring up and grow, he knoweth not how. The earth
     [1]beareth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, then
  29 the full corn in the ear. But when the fruit [2]is ripe,
     straightway he [3]putteth forth the sickle, because the harvest is
     come [_see Joel 3:13_].

     [Footnote 1: Or, _yieldeth_.]

     [Footnote 2: Or, _alloweth_.]

     [Footnote 3: Or, _sendeth forth_.]


  (c) Parable of the Tares

  Matt. 13:24-30

  24   Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of heaven
  25 is likened unto a man that sowed good seed in his field: but while
     men slept, his enemy came and sowed [1]tares also among the wheat,
  26 and went away. But when the blade sprang up, and brought forth
  27 fruit, then appeared the tares also. And the [2]servants of the
     householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst thou not sow good
  28 seed in thy field? whence then hath it tares? And he said unto
     them, [3]An enemy hath done this. And the [2]servants say unto
  29 him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? But he saith,
     Nay; lest haply while ye gather up the tares, ye root up the wheat
  30 with them. Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the
     time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather up first the
     tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat
     into my barn.

     [Footnote 2: Gr. _bondservants_.]

     [Footnote 3: Gr. _A man_ that is _an enemy_.]


  (d) Parable of the Mustard Seed

  Mark 4:30-32                      |Matt. 13:31-32
                                    |
  30 And he said, How shall we liken|31   Another parable set he before
     the kingdom of God? or in what |   them, saying, The kingdom of
     parable shall we set it forth? |   heaven is like unto a grain of
     [1]It is like a grain of       |   mustard seed, which a man took,
     mustard seed, which, when it is|   and sowed in his field: which
     sown upon the earth, though it |   indeed is less than all seeds;
     be less than all the seeds that|   but when it is grown, it is
     are upon the earth, yet when it|   greater than the herbs, and
     is sown, groweth up, and       |   becometh a tree [_see Dan.
     becometh greater than all the  |   4:12, 21_], so that the birds
     herbs, and putteth out great   |   of the heaven come and lodge in
     branches; so that the birds of |   the branches thereof.
     the heaven can lodge under the |
     shadow thereof.                |

     [Footnote 1: Gr. _As unto_.]


  (e) Parable of the Leaven and many such Parables

  Mark 4:33-34                      |Matt. 13:33-35
                                    |
                                    |33   Another parable spake he unto
                                    |   them; The kingdom of heaven is
                                    |   like unto leaven, which a woman
                                    |   took, and hid in three
                                    |   [1]measures of meal, till it
                                    |   was all leavened.
  33   And with many[a] such        |34   All these things spake Jesus
     parables spake he the word unto|   in parables unto the multitudes;
     them, as they were able to hear|   and without[a] a parable spake
  34 it: and without a parable spake|35 he nothing unto them: that it
     he not unto them: but privately|   might be fulfilled which was
     to his disciples he expounded  |   spoken [2]by the prophet,
     all things.                    |   saying,
                                    |     I will open my mouth in
                                    |       parables;
                                    |     I will utter things hidden
                                    |       from the foundation [3]of
                                    |       the world [_see Ps. 78:2_].

     [Footnote 1: The word in the Greek denotes the Hebrew seah, a
     measure containing nearly a peck and a half.]

     [Footnote 2: Or, _through_.]

     [Footnote 3: Many ancient authorities omit _of the world_.]

[Footnote a: Note the expression. Matthew gives nine in Chapter 13 and
Mark another. There may have been still others on this day.]


_2. To the Disciples in the House_


  (a) Explanation of the Parable of the Tares

  Matt. 13:36-43

  36   Then he left the multitudes, and went into the house: and his
     disciples came unto him, saying, Explain unto us the parable of
  37 the tares of the field. And he answered and said, He that soweth
  38 the good seed is the Son of man; and the field is the world; and
     the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and the tares
  39 are the sons of the evil _one_; and the enemy that sowed them is
     the devil: and the harvest is [1]the end of the world; and the
  40 reapers are angels. As therefore the tares are gathered up and
  41 burned with fire; so shall it be in [1]the end of the world. The
     Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out
     of his kingdom all things that cause stumbling, and them that do
  42 iniquity, and shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there
  43 shall be the weeping and gnashing of teeth. Then shall the
     righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father
     [_see Dan. 12:3_]. He that hath ears, let him hear.

     [Footnote 1: Or, _the consummation of the age_.]


  (b) The Parable of the Hid Treasure

  Matt. 13:44

  44   The kingdom of heaven is like unto a treasure hidden in the
     field; which a man found, and hid; and [1]in his joy he goeth and
     selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.

     [Footnote 1: Or, _for joy thereof_.]


  (c) The Parable of the Pearl of Great Price

  Matt. 13:45-46

  45   Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a
  46 merchant seeking goodly pearls: and having found one pearl of great
     price, he went and sold all that he had, and bought it.


  (d) The Parable of the Net

  Matt. 13:47-50

  47   Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a [1]net, that was cast
  48 into the sea, and gathered of every kind: which, when it was
     filled, they drew up on the beach; and they sat down, and gathered
  49 the good into vessels, but the bad they cast away. So shall it be
     in [2]the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever
  50 the wicked from among the righteous, and shall cast them into the
     furnace of fire: there shall be the weeping and gnashing of teeth.

     [Footnote 1: Gr. _dragnet_.]

     [Footnote 2: Or, _consummation of the age_.]


  (e) The Parable of the Householder

  Matt. 13:51-53

  51   Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea. And
  52 he said unto them, Therefore every scribe who hath been made a
     disciple to the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a
     householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new
     and old.
  53   And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these parables,[a] he
     departed thence.

[Footnote a: Eight of these ten parables go in pairs (the sower and the
seed growing of itself, the tares and the net, the mustard seed and the
leaven, the hid treasure and the pearl of great price). But nothing can
be made out of the number of the parables spoken on this day. We do not
even know what the number was. Jesus had spoken various shorter and more
or less isolated parables before this occasion. An immediate occasion for
the use of so many and such extended parables at this point was the
hostility of the Pharisees and the need of special instruction for the
disciples who were taught by Jesus how to interpret parables, though they
had much difficulty later in applying the instruction about the parabolic
teaching.]




Sect. 65. IN CROSSING THE LAKE, JESUS STILLS THE TEMPEST

  35   And on that day,  |18   Now when Jesus saw|
     when even was come, |   great multitudes    |
     he saith unto them, |   about him, he gave  |
     Let us go over unto |   commandment to      |

     as he was, in the   |   followed him.       |   his disciples; and
     boat. And other     |                       |   he said unto them,
     boats were with him.|                       |   Let us go over to
                         |                       |   the other side of
                         |                       |   the lake: and they
                         |                       |   launched forth.
                         |                       |23 But as they sailed
                         |                       |   he fell asleep:
  37 And there ariseth a |24               And   |   and there came
     great storm of wind,|   behold, there arose |   down a storm of

     into the boat,      |   the sea, insomuch   |   and they were
     insomuch that the   |   that the boat was   |   filling _with
     boat was now        |   covered with the    |   water_, and were
  38 filling. And he     |   waves: but he was   |   in jeopardy.
     himself was in the  |25 asleep. And they    |
     stern, asleep on the|   came to him, and    |
     cushion: and they   |   awoke him, saying,  |24              And
     awake him, and say  |   Save, Lord; we      |   they came to him,
     unto him, Master,   |   perish.             |   and awoke him,
     carest thou not that|                       |   saying, Master,
  39 we perish? And he   |26        And he saith |   master, we perish.
     awoke, and rebuked  |   unto them, Why are  |   And he awoke, and
     the wind, and said  |   ye fearful, O ye of |   rebuked the wind
     unto the sea, Peace,|   little faith? Then  |   and the raging of

  40 calm. And he said   |   there was a great   |

textual critics that the correct text in Luke is Gerasenes, as well as in
Mark, and by Dr. Thomson's discovery of a ruin on the lake shore, named
Khersa (Gerasa). If this village was included (a very natural
supposition) in the district belonging to the city of Gadara, some miles
south-eastward, then the locality could be described as either in the
country of the Gadarenes, or in the country of the Gerasenes.]

                         |   that hour.          |   he said unto her,

     spake, they come    |                       |   spake, there
     from the ruler of   |                       |   cometh one from
     the synagogue's     |                       |   the ruler of the
     _house_, saying, Thy|                       |   synagogue's

     [7]not heeding the  |                       |   Jesus hearing it,

to place 9:18 after 9:17. I do not think so, for "while he spake" may be
merely an introductory phrase for a new paragraph. It is best to follow
Mark's order, as Luke does, for Matthew is not chronological in this part
of his Gospel.]




Sect. 68. HE HEALS TWO BLIND MEN, AND A DUMB DEMONIAC. A BLASPHEMOUS
ACCUSATION


  Matt. 9:27-34

  27   And as Jesus passed by from thence, two blind men followed him,
  28 crying out, and saying, Have mercy on us, thou son of David. And
     when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him: and
     Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They
  29 say unto him, Yea, Lord. Then touched he their eyes, saying,
  30 According to your faith be it done unto you. And their eyes were
     opened. And Jesus [1]strictly charged them, saying, See that no
  31 man know it. But they went forth, and spread abroad his fame in
     all that land.
  32   And as they went forth, behold, there was brought to him a dumb
  33 man possessed with a [2]devil. And when the [2]devil was cast out,
     the dumb man spake: and the multitudes marvelled, saying, It was
  34 never so seen in Israel. But the Pharisees said, [3]By the prince
     of the [4]devils casteth he out [4]devils.

                                    |
   1   And he went out from thence; |
     and he cometh into his own     |

     sabbath was come, he began to  |54   And coming into his own
     teach in the synagogue: and    |   country he taught them in their

     and are not his sisters here   |   us? Whence then hath this man
     with us? And they were         |57 all these things? And they were
   4 [2]offended in him. And Jesus  |   [2]offended in him. But Jesus

     work, save that he laid his    |   of their unbelief.
     hands upon a few sick folk, and|
   6 healed them. And he marvelled  |
     because of their unbelief.     |

[Footnote a: There is no sufficient occasion to identify this visit to
Nazareth with that described by Luke. That was at the very beginning of
the great ministry in Galilee, and this is near its close. The details
are quite different. It is perfectly natural that after a long interval
he should give the Nazarenes another opportunity to hear his teaching,
and to witness miracles, which he would not work for them when demanded,
but now voluntarily works in a few cases, so far as their now _wonderful_
unbelief left it appropriate.]

Sect. 70. THE THIRD TOUR OF GALILEE AFTER INSTRUCTING THE TWELVE AND
SENDING THEM FORTH BY TWOS


  Mark 6:6-13            |Matt. 9:35 to 11:1
                         |
   6   And he went round |35   And Jesus went about all the cities and
     about the villages  |   the villages,[a] teaching in their
     teaching.           |   synagogues, and preaching the gospel of
                         |   the kingdom, and healing all manner of
  36 disease and all manner of sickness. But when he saw the
     multitudes, he was moved with compassion for them, because they
     were distressed and scattered, as sheep not having a shepherd
  37 [_see Num. 27:17; Ezek. 34:5_]. Then saith he unto his disciples,
  38 The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few. Pray ye
                         |   therefore the Lord  |
                         |   of the harvest, that|
                         |   he send forth       |
                         |   labourers into his  |Luke 9:1-6
                         |   harvest.            |
   7   And he called unto| 1   And he called unto| 1   And he called the
     him the twelve, and |   him his twelve      |   twelve together,
     began to send them  |   disciples, and gave |   and gave them
     forth by two and    |   them authority over |   power and
     two; and he gave    |   unclean spirits, to |   authority over all
     them authority over |   cast them out, and  |   [3]devils, and to
     the unclean spirits;|   to heal all manner  | 2 cure diseases. And
   8 and he charged them |   of disease and all  |   he sent them forth
                         |   manner of sickness. |   to preach the
                         |                       |   kingdom of God,
   2   Now the names of the twelve apostles are  |   and to heal
     these: The first, Simon, who is called      | 3 [19]the sick. And
     Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the    |   he said unto them,
   3 _son_ of Zebedee, and John his brother;     |
     Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew|
     the publican; James the _son_ of Alphaeus,  |
   4 and Thaddaeus; Simon the [1]Cananaean, and  |
     Judas Iscariot, who also [2]betrayed him.   |
   5 These twelve Jesus sent forth, and charged  |
     them, saying, Go not into _any_ way of the  |
     Gentiles, and enter not into any city of the|
   6 Samaritans: but go rather to the lost sheep |
   7 of the house of Israel. And as ye go,       |
     preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at |
                         | 8 hand. Heal the sick,|
                         |   raise the dead,     |
                         |   cleanse the lepers, |
     that they should    |   cast out [3]devils: |
     take nothing for    |   freely ye received, |   Take nothing for
     _their_ journey,    | 9 freely give. Get you|   your journey,
     save a staff only;  |   no gold, nor silver,|   neither staff, nor
     no bread, no wallet,|   nor brass in your   |   wallet, nor bread,
     no [17]money in     |10 [4]purses; no wallet|   nor money; neither
   9 their [18]purse; but|   for _your_ journey, |   have two coats.
     _to go_ shod with   |   neither two coats,  |
     sandals: and, _said |   nor shoes, nor      |
     he_, put not on two |   staff: for the      |
     coats.              |   labourer is worthy  |
                         |   of his food. And    |
  10        And he said  |11 into whatsoever city| 4 And into whatsoever
     unto them,          |   or village ye shall |   house ye enter,
     Wheresoever ye enter|   enter, search out   |   there abide, and
     into a house, there |   who in it is worthy;| 5 thence depart. And
     abide till ye depart|   and there abide till|
  11 thence. And         |12 ye go forth. And as |
     whatsoever place    |   ye enter into the   |
                         |   house, salute it.   |
                         |13 And if the house be |
                         |   worthy, let your    |
                         |   peace come upon it: |
                         |   but if it be not    |
                         |   worthy, let your    |
                         |   peace return to you.|

     you, and they hear  |   not receive you, nor|   you not, when ye
     you not, as ye go   |   hear your words, as |   depart from that
     forth thence, shake |   ye go forth out of  |   city, shake off
     off the dust that is|   that house or that  |   the dust from your
     under your feet for |   city, shake off the |   feet for a
     a testimony unto    |   dust of your feet.  |   testimony against
     them.               |15 Verily I say unto   |   them.
                         |   you, It shall be    |
                         |   more tolerable for  |
                         |   the land of Sodom   |
                         |   and Gomorrah in the |
                         |   day of judgement,   |
                         |   than for that city. |
  16   Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye
  17 therefore wise as serpents, and [5]harmless as doves. But beware
     of men: for they will deliver you up to councils, and in their
  18 synagogues they will scourge you; yea and before governors and
     kings shall ye be brought for my sake, for a testimony to them and
  19 to the Gentiles. But when they deliver you up, be not anxious how
     or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that hour
  20 what ye shall speak. For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit
  21 of your Father that speaketh in you. And brother shall deliver up
     brother to death, and the father his child: and children shall
  22 rise up against parents, and [6]cause them to be put to death. And
     ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that
  23 endureth to the end, the same shall be saved. But when they
     persecute you in this city, flee into the next: for verily I say
     unto you, Ye shall not have gone through the cities of Israel,
     till the Son of man be come.
  24   A disciple is not above his [7]master, nor a [8]servant above his
  25 lord. It is enough for the disciple that he be as his [7]master,
     and the [8]servant as his lord. If they have called the master of
     the house [9]Beelzebub, how much more _shall they call_ them of
  26 his household! Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing
     covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be
  27 known. What I tell you in the darkness, speak ye in the light: and
  28 what ye hear in the ear, proclaim upon the housetops. And be not
     afraid of them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the
     soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and
  29 body in [10]hell. Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and
  30 not one of them shall fall on the ground without your Father: but
  31 the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not therefore;
  32 ye are of more value than many sparrows. Every one therefore who
     shall confess [11]me before men, [12]him will I also confess
  33 before my Father which is in heaven. But whosoever shall deny me
     before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in
     heaven.
  34   Think not that I came to [13]send peace on the earth: I came not
  35 to [13]send peace, but a sword. For I came to set a man at
     variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother,
  36 and the daughter in law against her mother in law: and a man's
  37 foes _shall be_ they of his own household [_see Micah 7:6_]. He
     that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and
     he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
  38 And he that doth not take his cross and follow after me, is not
  39 worthy of me. He that [14]findeth his [15]life shall lose it; and
     he that [16]loseth his [15]life for my sake shall find it [_see
     John 12:25_].
  40   He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me
  41 receiveth him that sent me [_see John 13:20_]. He that receiveth a
     prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward;
     and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous
  42 man shall receive a righteous man's reward. And whosoever shall
     give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water
     only, in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in
     no wise lose his reward.

[Footnote a: Mark's connection shows that Herod Antipas was impressed by
the account of miracles which the disciples had wrought, as well as by
those of Jesus himself.]

[Footnote b: Josephus (_Antiquities_, Book XVIII, v., 2) says of John
that Herod "thought it best, by putting him to death, to prevent any
mischief he might cause, and not bring himself into difficulties, by
sparing a man who might make him repent of it when it should be too
late." Josephus in no wise controverts the picture in Mark where Herodias
appears as the one who prods Antipas to put John out of the way to
satisfy her resentment against him for his rebuke of her adulterous
marriage. Josephus merely presents the public and political aspects of
the imprisonment and death of John.]




PART VIII

THE SPECIAL TRAINING OF THE TWELVE IN DISTRICTS AROUND GALILEE

Probably Passover in A.D. 29[a] to near Tabernacles in A.D. 29 or a year
earlier (six months from spring to autumn). Just a year from the
beginning of this Period till the Crucifixion. Emphasis now on the King
of the Kingdom (the Person of the Messiah).

_Sects. 72-95. Four separate withdrawals[b] from Galilee are given, in
Sects. 72, 78, 79, 81. Notice that in every case he keeps out of Herod's
territory, and in every case he goes to the mountains._

[Footnote a: If the ministry of Jesus was three and a half years in
length. If there were only three passovers in the ministry, then the year
would be A.D. 28. This period begins just before a passover (John 6:4).]

[Footnote b: There are five reasons for the withdrawals from Galilee. He
withdraws from the jealousy of Herod Antipas (Sect. 71), from the
fanaticism of would-be followers in Galilee (John 6:15), and the
hostility of the Jewish rulers; and leaving the hot shores of the Lake of
Galilee, he spent the summer in mountain districts around, resting, and
_instructing the Twelve_.]

Sect. 76. THE COLLAPSE OF THE GALILEAN CAMPAIGN BECAUSE JESUS WILL NOT
CONFORM TO POPULAR MESSIANIC EXPECTATIONS

_The next day in the Synagogue in Capernaum. The same crowd that had
eaten the Loaves and the Fishes leave Christ in disgust on learning that
He is the Bread of Life and not a Political Messiah._


  John 6:22-71

  22   On the morrow the multitude which stood on the other side of the
     sea saw that there was none other [1]boat there, save one, and
     that Jesus entered not with his disciples into the boat, but
  23 _that_ his disciples went away alone (howbeit there came [2]boats
     from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they ate the bread after
  24 the Lord had given thanks): when the multitude therefore saw that
     Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they themselves got
  25 into the [2]boats, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus. And when
     they found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him,
  26 Rabbi, when camest thou hither? Jesus answered them and said,
     Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw
  27 signs, but because ye ate of the loaves, and were filled. Work not
     for the meat which perisheth, but for the meat which abideth unto
     eternal life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him
  28 the Father, _even_ God, hath sealed. They said therefore unto him,
  29 What must we do, that we may work the works of God? Jesus answered
     and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on
  30 him whom [3]he hath sent. They said therefore unto him, What then
     doest thou for a sign, that we may see, and believe thee? what
  31 workest thou? Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it
     is written, He gave them bread out of heaven to eat [_see Ex.
  32 16:4, 15; Ps. 78:24; Neh. 9:15_]. Jesus therefore said unto them,
     Verily, verily, I say unto you, It was not Moses that gave you the
     bread out of heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread out
  33 of heaven. For the bread of God is that which cometh down out of
  34 heaven, and giveth life unto the world. They said therefore unto
  35 him, Lord, evermore give us this bread. Jesus said unto them, I am
     the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall not hunger, and he
  36 that believeth on me shall never thirst. But I said unto you, that
  37 ye have seen me, and yet believe not. All that which the Father
     giveth me shall come unto me; and him that cometh to me I will in
  38 no wise cast out. For I am come down from heaven, not to do mine
  39 own will, but the will of him that sent me. And this is the will
     of him that sent me, that of all that which he hath given me I
  40 should lose nothing, but should raise it up at the last day. For
     this is the will of my Father, that every one that beholdeth the
     Son, and believeth on him, should have eternal life; and [4]I will
     raise him up at the last day.
  41   The Jews therefore murmured concerning him, because he said, I am
  42 the bread which came down out of heaven. And they said, Is not
     this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know?
  43 how doth he now say, I am come down out of heaven? Jesus answered
  44 and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves. No man can come
     to me, except the Father which sent me draw him: and I will raise
  45 him up in the last day. It is written in the prophets [_see Isa.
     54:13_], And they shall all be taught of God. Every one that hath
  46 heard from the Father, and hath learned, cometh unto me. Not that
     any man hath seen the Father, save he which is from God, he hath
  47 seen the Father. Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth
  48 hath eternal life. I am the bread of life. Your fathers did eat
  49 the manna in the wilderness, and they died. This is the bread
  50 which cometh down out of heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and
  51 not die. I am the living bread which came down out of heaven: if
     any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: yea and the
     bread which I will give is my flesh, for the life of the world.
  52   The Jews therefore strove one with another, saying, How can this
  53 man give us his flesh to eat? Jesus therefore said unto them,
     Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son
  54 of man and drink his blood, ye have not life in yourselves. He
     that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life; and
  55 I will raise him up at the last day. For my flesh is [5]meat
  56 indeed, and my blood is [6]drink indeed. He that eateth my flesh
  57 and drinketh my blood abideth in me, and I in him. As the living
     Father sent me, and I live because of the Father; so he that
  58 eateth me, he also shall live because of me. This is the bread
     which came down out of heaven: not as the fathers did eat, and
  59 died: he that eateth this bread shall live for ever. These things
     said he in [7]the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.
  60   Many therefore of his disciples, when they heard _this_, said,
  61 This is a hard saying; who can hear [8]it? But Jesus knowing in
     himself that his disciples murmured at this, said unto them, Doth
  62 this cause you to stumble? _What_ then if ye should behold the Son
  63 of man ascending where he was before? It is the spirit that
     quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I have
  64 spoken unto you are spirit, and are life. But there are some of
     you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they
  65 were that believed not, and who it was that should betray him. And
     he said, For this cause have I said unto you, that no man can come
     unto me, except it be given unto him of the Father.
  66   Upon this many of his disciples went back, and walked no more
  67 with him. Jesus said therefore unto the twelve, Would ye also go
  68 away? Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou
  69 [9]hast the words of eternal life. And we have believed and know
  70 that thou art the Holy One of God. Jesus answered them, Did not I
  71 choose you the twelve, and one of you is a devil? Now he spake of
     Judas _the son_ of Simon Iscariot, for he it was that should betray
     him, _being_ one of the twelve.

Sect. 77. PHARISEES FROM JERUSALEM REPROACH JESUS FOR ALLOWING HIS

     reject the commandment of God, |

  10 tradition. For Moses [_see Ex. |

  17 man.[11] And when he was       |
     entered into the house from the|
     multitude, his disciples asked |
     of him the parable.            |12 Then came the disciples, and
                                    |   said unto him, Knowest thou
                                    |   that the Pharisees were
                                    |   [4]offended, when they heard
                                    |13 this saying? But he answered
                                    |   and said, Every [5]plant which
                                    |   my heavenly Father planted not,
                                    |14 shall be rooted up. Let them
                                    |   alone: they are blind guides.

  18                     And he     |   said unto him, Declare unto us
     saith unto them, Are ye so     |16 the parable. And he said, Are
     without understanding also?    |   ye also even yet without

Sect. 79. THE THIRD WITHDRAWAL NORTH THROUGH PHOENICIA AND EAST TOWARDS

     Galilee, through the midst of  |   the mountain, and sat there.
     the borders of Decapolis.[a]   |
  32 And they bring unto him one    |
     that was deaf, and had an      |
     impediment in his speech; and  |
     they beseech him to lay his    |
  33 hand upon him. And he took him |
     aside from the multitude       |
     privately, and put his fingers |
     into his ears, and he spat, and|
  34 touched his tongue; and looking|
     up to heaven, he sighed, and   |
     saith unto him, Ephphatha, that|
  35 is, Be opened. And his ears    |
     were opened, and the bond of   |
     his tongue was loosed, and he  |
  36 spake plain. And he charged    |30 And there came unto him great
     them that they should tell no  |   multitudes, having with them
     man: but the more he charged   |   the lame, blind, dumb, maimed,

     they were beyond measure       |31 healed them: insomuch that the
     astonished, saying, He hath    |   multitude wondered, when they
     done all things well: he maketh|   saw the dumb speaking, the
     even the deaf to hear, and the |   maimed whole, and the lame
     dumb to speak.                 |   walking, and the blind seeing:

     [1]bread here in a desert      |34 so great a multitude? And Jesus
   5 place? And he asked them, How  |   saith unto them, How many
     many loaves have ye? And they  |   loaves have ye? And they said,
   6 said, Seven. And he commandeth |   Seven, and a few small fishes.
     the multitude to sit down on   |35 And he commanded the multitude
     the ground: and he took the    |36 to sit down on the ground; and
     seven loaves, and having given |   he took the seven loaves and
     thanks, he brake, and gave to  |   the fishes; and he gave thanks
     his disciples, to set before   |   and brake, and gave to the
     them; and they set them before |   disciples, and the disciples to
   7 the multitude. And they had a  |   multitudes.

[Footnote a: Observe how carefully he keeps away from the territory ruled
by Herod Antipas. The tetrarch Philip, who governed the districts east of
the Lake of Galilee and of the upper Jordan, was a better man than
Antipas, and moreover had no cause to feel uneasy about Jesus.]

[Footnote b: It is to be noted that Mark and Matthew give the feeding of
the five thousand and of the four thousand. Mark and Matthew likewise
report Jesus as referring to both incidents (Mark 8:19-20 = Matt.
16:9-10). Hence, it is hard to think of a mere confusion in the use of
the data. There is no real reason why both incidents could not be true.]

Sect. 81. THE FOURTH RETIREMENT TO BETHSAIDA JULIAS IN THE TETRARCHY OF
HEROD PHILIP WITH SHARP REBUKE OF THE DULNESS OF THE DISCIPLES ON THE WAY
ACROSS AND THE HEALING OF A BLIND MAN IN BETHSAIDA


  Mark 8:13-26                      |Matt. 16:5-12

     departed to the other side.    |
  14   And they forgot to take      | 5   And the disciples came to the
     bread; and they had not in the |   other side and forgot to take
     boat with them more than one   | 6 [1]bread. And Jesus said unto
  15 loaf. And he charged them,     |   them, Take heed and beware of
     saying, Take heed, beware of   |   the leaven of the Pharisees and
     the leaven of the Pharisees and| 7 Sadducees. And they reasoned
  16 the leaven of Herod. And they  |   among themselves, saying, [2]We
     reasoned one with another,     | 8 took no [1]bread. And Jesus
  17 [4]saying. [5]We have no bread.|   perceiving it said, O ye of
     And Jesus perceiving it saith  |   little faith, why reason ye
     unto them, Why reason ye,      |   among yourselves, because ye
     because ye have no bread? do ye| 9 have no [1]bread? Do ye not yet
     not yet perceive, neither      |   perceive, neither remember the

     not? and having ears, hear ye  |10 [3]baskets ye took up? Neither
     not? and do ye not remember    |   the seven loaves of the four
  19 [_see Jer. 5:21; Ezek. 12:2_]? |   thousand, and how many
     When I brake the five loaves   |11 [3]baskets ye took up? How is
     among the five thousand, how   |   it that ye do not perceive that
     many [6]baskets full of broken |   I spake not to you concerning
     pieces took ye up? They say    |   [1]bread? But beware of the

     he said unto them, Do ye not   |   of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
     yet understand?
  22   And they come unto Bethsaida.[a] And they bring to him a blind
  23 man, and beseech him to touch him. And he took hold of the blind
     man by the hand, and brought him out of the village; and when he
     had spit on his eyes, and laid his hands upon him, he asked him,
  24 Seest thou aught? And he looked up, and said, I see men; for I
  25 behold _them_ as trees, walking. Then again he laid his hands upon
     his eyes; and he looked stedfastly, and was restored, and saw all
  26 things clearly. And he sent him away to his home, saying, Do not
     even enter into the village.

[Footnote a: Jesus goes on to the region of Caesarea Philippi on Mount
Hermon, where no hostility had been aroused, and he could quietly
instruct the Twelve. He probably remained in that vicinity several
months, as this whole period of retirement lasted six months. He was near
Bethsaida Julias in the First Retirement and now he stops here again on
his way to Caesarea Philippi. Each of the four retirements is into
heathen territory (Ituraea twice, Phoenicia, Decapolis), where Greek
influence prevails, and where the Greek language is dominant.]




Sect. 82. NEAR CAESAREA PHILIPPI JESUS TESTS THE FAITH OF THE TWELVE IN
HIS MESSIAHSHIP


  Mark 8:27-30           |Matt. 16:13-20         |Luke 9:18-21

     [Footnote 3: Gr. _petra_.]

[Footnote a: Some understand ver. 16f. as showing that they had never
before believed him to be the Messiah, and so hold that the other Gospels
here utterly conflict with John, who represents the first disciples
(Sects. 28, 35) as believing Jesus to be the Messiah. But it is easy to
suppose that their early faith in his Messiahship was shaken by his
continued failure to gather armies and set up the expected temporal
kingdom, and while still believing him to have a divine mission they had
questioned whether he was the Messiah, as John the Baptist did in prison
(Sect. 57). Observe that in Matthew and Luke he long before this time
distinctively _implied_ that he was the Messiah, in response to the
Forerunner's inquiries (Sect. 57). Besides, at the Baptism and the
Temptation, the Synoptic Gospels represent Jesus as the Son of God.]

[Footnote b: It is interesting to note that the imagery employed by Jesus
here all appears in Ps. 89, a Messianic Psalm built on 2 Sam. 7. Thus
note "build" in Ps. 89:4, "rock" in 89:26, "anointed" in 89:38, "the
power of Sheol" in 89:48, and the Psalm discusses the perpetuity of the
Davidic throne (Kingdom). Jesus applies this imagery to the spiritual
Kingdom that He is building.]

Sect. 86. THE PUZZLE OF THE THREE DISCIPLES ABOUT THE RESURRECTION AND
ABOUT ELIJAH ON THEIR WAY DOWN THE MOUNTAIN


  Mark 9:9-13            |Matt. 17:9-13          |Luke 9:36

   9   And as they were  | 9   And as they were  |

     what things they had|   vision to no man,   |   told no man in

     they kept the       |   saying, Why then say|
     saying, questioning |   the scribes that    |
     among themselves    |   Elijah must first   |
     what the rising     |   come [_see Mal.     |
     again from the dead |11 4:5-6_]? And he     |
  11 should mean. And    |   answered and said,  |
     they asked him,     |   Elijah indeed       |
     saying, [1]The      |   cometh, and shall   |
     scribes say that    |   restore all things: |
     Elijah must first   |12 but I say unto you, |
  12 come. And he said   |   that Elijah is come |
     unto them, Elijah   |   already,[a] and they|
     indeed cometh first,|   knew him not, but   |
     and restoreth all   |   did unto him        |
     things: and how is  |   whatsoever they     |

     Elijah is come, and |   spake unto them of  |
     they have also done |   John the Baptist.   |
     unto him whatsoever |                       |
     they listed, even as|                       |
     it is written of    |                       |

means only that he was not Elijah in person come back to earth according
to popular expectation.]

  24   And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received the
     [1]half-shekel came to Peter, and said, Doth not your [2]master
  25 pay the [1]half-shekel [_see Ex. 30:11-15_]? He saith, Yea. And
     when he came into the house, Jesus spake first to him, saying,
     What thinkest thou, Simon? the kings of the earth, from whom do
     they receive toll or tribute? from their sons, or from strangers?
  26 And when he said, From strangers, Jesus said unto him, Therefore
  27 the sons are free. But, lest we cause them to stumble, go thou to
     the sea, and cast a hook, and take up the fish that first cometh
     up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a
     [3]shekel: that take, and give unto them for me and thee.

Sect. 92. RIGHT TREATMENT OF A BROTHER WHO HAS SINNED AGAINST ONE, AND
DUTY OF PATIENTLY FORGIVING A BROTHER (PARABLE OF THE UNMERCIFUL SERVANT)


  Matt. 18:15-35

  15   And if thy brother sin [1]against thee, go, shew him his fault
     between thee and him alone: if he hear thee, thou hast gained thy
  16 brother. But if he hear _thee_ not, take with thee one or two
     more, that at the mouth of two witnesses or three every word may
  17 be established [_see Deut. 19:15_]. And if he refuse to hear them,
     tell it unto the [2]church: and if he refuse to hear the [2]church
  18 also, let him be unto thee as the Gentile and the publican. Verily
     I say unto you, What things soever ye shall bind on earth shall be
     bound in heaven: and what things soever ye shall loose on earth
  19 shall be loosed in heaven. Again I say unto you, that if two of
     you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask,
  20 it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven. For
     where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in
     the midst of them.
  21   Then came Peter, and said to him, Lord, how oft shall my brother
  22 sin against me, and I forgive him? until seven times? Jesus saith
     unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times; but, Until
  23 [3]seventy times seven. Therefore is the kingdom of heaven
     likened[a] unto a certain king, which would make a reckoning with
  24 his [4]servants. And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought
  25 unto him, which owed him ten thousand [5]talents. But forasmuch as
     he had not _wherewith_ to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold,
     and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be
  26 made. The [6]servant therefore fell down and worshipped him,
  27 saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. And
     the lord of that [6]servant, being moved with compassion, released
  28 him, and forgave him the [7]debt. But that [6]servant went out, and
     found one of his fellow-servants, which owed him a hundred
     [8]pence: and he laid hold on him, and took _him_ by the throat,
  29 saying, Pay what thou owest. So his fellow-servant fell down and
     besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee.
  30 And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he
  31 should pay that which was due. So when his fellow-servants saw
     what was done, they were exceeding sorry, and came and told unto
  32 their lord all that was done. Then his lord called him unto him,
     and saith unto him, Thou wicked [6]servant, I forgave thee all
  33 that debt, because thou besoughtest me: shouldest not thou also
     have had mercy on thy fellow-servant, even as I had mercy on
  34 thee?[b] And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the
  35 tormentors, till he should pay all that was due. So shall also my
     heavenly Father do unto you, if ye forgive not every one his
     brother from your hearts.

                                    |   first suffer me to bid farewell

                                    |62 But Jesus said unto him, No man,

                                    |   plough, and looking back, is fit

Sect. 94. THE UNBELIEVING BROTHERS OF JESUS COUNSEL HIM TO EXHIBIT
HIMSELF IN JUDEA, AND HE REJECTS THE ADVICE


  John 7:2-9

   2   Now the feast of the Jews, the feast of tabernacles, was at hand.
   3 His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into
     Judea, that thy disciples also may behold thy works which thou
   4 doest. For no man doeth anything in secret, [1]and himself seeketh
     to be known openly. If thou doest these things, manifest thyself
   5 to the world. For even his brethren did not believe on him. Jesus
   6 therefore saith unto them, My time is not yet come; but your time
   7 is alway ready. The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth,
   8 because I testify of it, that its works are evil. Go ye up unto
     the feast: I go not up [2]yet unto this feast; because my time is
   9 not yet fulfilled. And having said these things unto them, he
     abode _still_ in Galilee.

                                    |
  51   And it came to pass, when    |10   But when his brethren were
     the days [1]were well-nigh come|   gone up unto the feast, then
     that he should be received up, |   went he also up, not publicly,

  52 go to Jerusalem,[a] and sent   |
     messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a
  53 village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him. And they did not
     receive him, because his face was _as though he were_ going to
  54 Jerusalem. And when his disciples James and John saw _this_, they
     said, Lord, wilt thou that we bid fire to come down from heaven,
  55 and consume them[2] [_see 2 Kings 1:10-12_]? But he turned, and
  56 rebuked them[3]. And they went to another village.

     [Footnote 1: Gr. _were being fulfilled_.]

     [Footnote 2: Many ancient authorities add, _even as Elijah did_.]

     [Footnote 3: Some ancient authorities add, _and said, Ye know not

     the Son of man came not to destroy men's lives, but to save_
     them.]

PART IX

THE LATER JUDEAN MINISTRY

(Probably Tabernacles to Dedication, about three months, in A.D. 29 or 28
if Ministry only two and a half years in length)


_This ministry is given only by John and Luke. John gives the Jerusalem
ministry and Luke that in the country of Judea. Sects. 96-111._




Sect. 96. THE COMING OF JESUS TO THE FEAST OF TABERNACLES CREATES INTENSE
EXCITEMENT CONCERNING THE MESSIAHSHIP

_The attempt of the rulers (the Jews, the chief priests, and Pharisees)
to arrest him. Division of sentiment in the Galilean multitude at the
feast. Impressions of the Jerusalem populace and the Roman officers and
of Nicodemus._


  John 7:11-52

  11   The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, Where is
  12 he? And there was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning
     him: some said, He is a good man; others said, Not so, but he
  13 leadeth the multitude astray. Howbeit no man spake openly of him
     for fear of the Jews.
  14   But when it was now the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the
  15 temple, and taught. The Jews therefore marvelled, saying, How
  16 knoweth this man letters, having never learned? Jesus therefore
     answered them, and said, My teaching is not mine, but his that
  17 sent me. If any man willeth to do his will, he shall know of the
     teaching, whether it be of God, or _whether_ I speak from myself.
  18 He that speaketh from himself seeketh his own glory: but he that
     seeketh the glory of him that sent him, the same is true, and no
  19 unrighteousness is in him. Did not Moses give you the law, and
  20 _yet_ none of you doeth the law? Why seek ye to kill me? The
     multitude answered, Thou hast a [1]devil: who seeketh to kill
  21 thee? Jesus answered and said unto them, I did one work, and ye
  22 all [2]marvel. For this cause hath Moses given you circumcision
     (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers); and on the sabbath
  23 ye circumcise a man [_see Gen. 17:9-14; Lev. 12:1-3_]. If a man
     receiveth circumcision on the sabbath, that the law of Moses may
     not be broken; are ye wroth with me, because I made a man every
  24 whit whole on the sabbath? Judge not according to appearance, but
     judge righteous judgement.
  25   Some therefore of them of Jerusalem said, Is not this he whom
  26 they seek to kill? And lo, he speaketh openly, and they say nothing
     unto him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is the
  27 Christ? Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when the Christ
  28 cometh, no one knoweth whence he is. Jesus therefore cried in the
     temple, teaching and saying, Ye both know me, and know whence I
     am; and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom
  29 ye know not. I know him; because I am from him, and he sent me.
  30 They sought therefore to take him: and no man laid his hand on
  31 him, because his hour was not yet come. But of the multitude many
     believed on him; and they said, When the Christ shall come, will
  32 he do more signs than those which this man hath done? The
     Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning
     him; and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to take
  33 him. Jesus therefore said, Yet a little while am I with you, and I
  34 go unto him that sent me. Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me:
  35 and where I am, ye cannot come. The Jews therefore said among
     themselves, Whither will this man go that we shall not find him?
     will he go unto the Dispersion [3]among the Greeks, and teach the
  36 Greeks? What is this word that he said, Ye shall seek me, and
     shall not find me: and where I am, ye cannot come?
  37   Now on the last day, the great _day_ of the feast, Jesus stood
     and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and
  38 drink. He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of
  39 his belly shall flow rivers of living water. But this spake he of
     the Spirit, which they that believed on him were to receive: [4]for
     the Spirit was not yet _given_; because Jesus was not yet
  40 glorified. _Some_ of the multitude therefore, when they heard
  41 these words, said, This is of a truth the prophet. Others said,
     This is the Christ. But some said, What, doth the Christ come out
  42 of Galilee? Hath not the scripture said that the Christ cometh of
     the seed of David, and from Bethlehem [_see 2 Sam. 7:12, 17;
  43 Mic. 5:2_], the village where David was? So there arose a division
  44 in the multitude because of him. And some of them would have taken
     him; but no man laid hands on him.
  45   The officers therefore came to the chief priests[a] and
  46 Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why did ye not bring him? The
  47 officers answered, Never man so spake. The Pharisees therefore
  48 answered them, Are ye also led astray? Hath any of the rulers
  49 believed on him, or of the Pharisees? But this multitude which
  50 knoweth not the law are accursed. Nicodemus saith unto them (he
  51 that came to him before, being one of them), Doth our law judge a
  52 man, except it first hear from himself and know what he doeth? They
     answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and
     [5]see that out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.

[Footnote a: The Sanhedrin included both Sadducees (chief priests) and
Pharisees. Nicodemus was a member of the Sanhedrin and a Pharisee. Now
both parties in the Sanhedrin were united against Jesus and the purpose
was to bring Jesus before the Sanhedrin for trial.]




Sect. 97. STORY OF AN ADULTERESS BROUGHT TO JESUS FOR JUDGMENT


  John 7:53 to 8:11[a]

  53, 1 [1][And they went every man unto his own house: but Jesus went
   2 unto the mount of Olives. And early in the morning he came again
     into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat
   3 down, and taught them. And the scribes and the Pharisees bring a
   4 woman taken in adultery; and having set her in the midst, they say
     unto him, [2]Master, this woman hath been taken in adultery, in
   5 the very act. Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such
     [_see Lev. 20:10; Deut. 22:22-24_]: what then sayest thou of her?
   6 And this they said, [3]tempting him, that they might have
     _whereof_ to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his
   7 finger wrote on the ground. But when they continued asking him, he
     lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin
   8 among you, let him first cast a stone at her. And again he stooped
   9 down, and with his finger wrote on the ground. And they, when they
     heard it, went out one by one, beginning from the eldest, _even_
     unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman, where she
  10 was, in the midst. And Jesus lifted up himself, and said unto her,
  11 Woman, where are they? did no man condemn thee? And she said, No
     man, Lord. And Jesus said, Neither do I condemn thee: go thy way;
     from henceforth sin no more.]

     Those which contain it vary much from each other.]

     [Footnote 3: Or, _trying_.]

[Footnote a: This paragraph can no longer be considered a part of the
Gospel of John, but it is in all probability a true story of Jesus, very
likely drawn by early students from the collection of Papias, published
about A.D. 140. See Hovey on John (American Comm. on N. T.). Observe that
without it Sect. 98 goes right on after Sect. 96.]




Sect. 98. AFTER THE FEAST OF TABERNACLES IN THE TEMPLE JESUS ANGERS THE
PHARISEES BY CLAIMING TO BE THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD


  John 8:12-20

  12   Again therefore Jesus spake unto them, saying, I am the light of
     the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in the darkness,
  13 but shall have the light of life. The Pharisees therefore said
     unto him, Thou bearest witness of thyself; thy witness is not
  14 true. Jesus answered and said unto them, Even if I bear witness of
     myself, my witness is true; for I know whence I came, and whither
  15 I go; but ye know not whence I come, or whither I go. Ye judge
  16 after the flesh; I judge no man. Yea and if I judge, my judgement
     is true; for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.
  17 Yea and in your law it is written, that the witness of two men is
  18 true [_see Deut. 17:6; 19:15_]. I am he that beareth witness of
  19 myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me. They
     said therefore unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye
     know neither me, nor my Father: if ye knew me, ye would know my
  20 Father also. These words spake he in the treasury, as he taught in
     the temple: and no man took him; because his hour was not yet
     come.




Sect. 99. THE PHARISEES ATTEMPT TO STONE JESUS WHEN HE EXPOSES THEIR
SINFULNESS

Jerusalem, probably in the Temple


  John 8:21-59

  21   He said therefore again unto them, I go away, and ye shall seek
  22 me, and shall die in your sin: whither I go, ye cannot come. The
     Jews therefore said, Will he kill himself, that he saith, Whither
  23 I go, ye cannot come? And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath;
  24 I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world. I
     said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for
     except ye believe that [1]I am _he_, ye shall die in your sins.
  25 They said therefore unto him, Who art thou? Jesus said unto them,
     [2]Even that which I have also spoken unto you from the beginning.
  26 I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you: howbeit
     he that sent me is true; and the things which I heard from him,
  27 these speak I [3]unto the world. They perceived not that he spake
  28 to them of the Father. Jesus therefore said, When ye have lifted
     up the Son of man, then shall ye know that [4]I am _he_, and _that_
     I do nothing of myself, but as the Father taught me, I speak these
  29 things. And he that sent me is with me; he hath not left me alone;
  30 for I do always the things that are pleasing to him. As he spake
     these things, many believed on him.
  31   Jesus therefore said to those Jews which had believed him, If ye
  32 abide in my word, _then_ are ye truly my disciples; and ye shall
  33 know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. They answered
     unto him, We be Abraham's seed, and have never yet been in bondage
  34 to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free? Jesus answered
     them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Every one that committeth
  35 sin is the bondservant of sin. And the bondservant abideth not in
  36 the house for ever: the son abideth for ever. If therefore the Son
  37 shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed. I know that ye are
     Abraham's seed; yet ye seek to kill me, because my word [5]hath
  38 not free course in you. I speak the things which I have seen with
     [6]_my_ Father: and ye also do the things which ye heard from
  39 _your_ father. They answered and said unto him, Our Father is
     Abraham. Jesus saith unto them, If ye [7]were Abraham's children,
  40 [8]ye would do the works of Abraham. But now ye seek to kill me, a
     man that hath told you the truth, which I heard from God: this did
  41 not Abraham. Ye do the works of your father. They said unto him,
     We were not born of fornication; we have one Father, _even_ God.
  42 Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me:
     for I came forth and am come from God; for neither have I come of
  43 myself, but he sent me. Why do ye not [9]understand my speech?
  44 _Even_ because ye cannot hear my word. Ye are of _your_ father
     the devil, and the lusts of your father it is your will to do. He
     was a murderer from the beginning, and [10]stood not in the truth,
     because there is no truth in him. [11]When he speaketh a lie, he
  45 speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father thereof. But
  46 because I say the truth, ye believe me not. Which of you
  47 convicteth me of sin? If I say truth, why do ye not believe me? He
     that is of God heareth the words of God: for this cause ye hear
  48 _them_ not, because ye are not of God. The Jews answered and said
     unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a
  49 [12]devil? Jesus answered, I have not a [12]devil; but I honour my
  50 Father, and ye dishonour me. But I seek not mine own glory: there
  51 is one that seeketh and judgeth. Verily, verily, I say unto you,
  52 If a man keep my word, he shall never see death. The Jews said
     unto him, Now we know that thou hast a [12]devil. Abraham is dead,
     and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my word, he shall
  53 never taste of death. Art thou greater than our father Abraham,
     which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou
  54 thyself? Jesus answered, If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing:
     it is my Father that glorifieth me; of whom ye say, that he is
  55 your God; and ye have not known him: but I know him; and if I
     should say, I know him not, I shall be like unto you, a liar: but
  56 I know him, and keep his word. Your father Abraham rejoiced [13]to
  57 see my day; and he saw it, and was glad. The Jews therefore said
     unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen
  58 Abraham? Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you,
  59 Before Abraham [14]was, I am. They took up stones therefore to
     cast at him: but Jesus [15]hid himself, and went out of the
     temple[16].

Sect. 100. JESUS HEALS A MAN BORN BLIND WHO OUTWITS THE PHARISEES. THE
RULERS FORBID THE RECOGNITION OF JESUS AS THE MESSIAH. THE CONVERSION OF
THE HEALED MAN

Jerusalem


  John 9:1-41

  1, 2  And as he passed by, he saw a man blind from his birth. And his
     disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, who did sin, this man, or his
   3 parents, that he should be born blind? Jesus answered, Neither did
     this man sin, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be
   4 made manifest in him. We must work the works of him that sent me,
   5 while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work. When I am
   6 in the world, I am the light of the world. When he had thus
     spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, [1]and
   7 anointed his eyes with the clay, and said unto him, Go, wash in
     the pool of Siloam (which is by interpretation, Sent). He went
   8 away therefore, and washed, and came seeing. The neighbours
     therefore, and they which saw him aforetime, that he was a beggar,
   9 said, Is not this he that sat and begged? Others said, It is he:
  10 others said, No, but he is like him. He said, I am _he_. They said
  11 therefore unto him, How then were thine eyes opened? He answered,
     The man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes,
     and said unto me, Go to Siloam, and wash: so I went away and
  12 washed, and I received sight. And they said unto him, Where is he?
     He saith, I know not.
  13, 14 They bring to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind. Now
     it was the sabbath on the day when Jesus made the clay, and opened
  15 his eyes. Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he
     received his sight. And he said unto them, He put clay upon mine
  16 eyes, and I washed, and do see. Some therefore of the Pharisees
     said, This man is not from God, because he keepeth not the
     sabbath. But others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such
  17 signs? And there was a division among them. They say therefore
     unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, in that he
  18 opened thine eyes? And he said, He is a prophet. The Jews
     therefore did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind,
     and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him
  19 that had received his sight, and asked them, saying, Is this your
  20 son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see? His
     parents answered and said, We know that this is our son, and that
  21 he was born blind: but how he now seeth, we know not; or who
     opened his eyes, we know not: ask him; he is of age; he shall
  22 speak for himself. These things said his parents, because they
     feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man
     should confess him _to be_ Christ, he should be put out of the
  23 synagogue. Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him. So
  24 they called the second time the man that was blind, and said unto
  25 him, Give glory to God: we know that this man is a sinner. He
     therefore answered, Whether he be a sinner, I know not: one thing
  26 I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see. They said therefore
  27 unto him, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes? He
     answered them, I told you even now, and ye did not hear: wherefore
  28 would ye hear it again? would ye also become his disciples? And
     they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are
  29 disciples of Moses. We know that God hath spoken unto Moses: but
  30 as for this man, we know not whence he is. The man answered and
     said unto them, Why, herein is the marvel, that ye know not whence
  31 he is, and _yet_ he opened mine eyes. We know that God heareth not
     sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and do his will,
  32 him he heareth. Since the world began it was never heard that any
  33 one opened the eyes of a man born blind. If this man were not from
  34 God, he could do nothing. They answered and said unto him, Thou
     wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they
     cast him out.
  35   Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and finding him, he said,
  36 Dost thou believe on [2]the Son of God? He answered and said, And
  37 who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him? Jesus said unto him,
  38 Thou hast both seen him, and he it is that speaketh with thee. And
  39 he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him. And Jesus said,
     For judgement came I into this world, that they which see not may
  40 see; and that they which see may become blind. Those of the
     Pharisees which were with him heard these things, and said unto
  41 him, Are we also blind? Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye
     would have no sin: but now ye say, We see: your sin remaineth.

Sect. 101. IN THE PARABLE (ALLEGORY) OF THE GOOD SHEPHERD JESUS DRAWS THE
PICTURE OF THE HOSTILE PHARISEES AND INTIMATES THAT HE IS GOING TO DIE
FOR HIS FLOCK AND COME TO LIFE AGAIN

Jerusalem


  John 10:1-21

   1   Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door
     into the fold of the sheep, but climbeth up some other way, the
   2 same is a thief and a robber. But he that entereth in by the door
   3 is [1]the shepherd of the sheep. To him the porter openeth; and
     the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name,
   4 and leadeth them out. When he hath put forth all his own, he goeth
     before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.
   5 And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for
   6 they know not the voice of strangers. This [2]parable spake Jesus
     unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he
     spake unto them.
   7   Jesus therefore said unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto
   8 you, I am the door of the sheep. All that came before me are
   9 thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them. I am the
     door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go
  10 in and go out, and shall find pasture. The thief cometh not, but
     that he may steal, and kill, and destroy: I came that they may
  11 have life, and may [3]have _it_ abundantly. I am the good
  12 shepherd: the good shepherd layeth down his life for the sheep. He
     that is a hireling, and not a shepherd, whose own the sheep are
     not, beholdeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth,
  13 and the wolf snatcheth them, and scattereth _them_: _he fleeth_
  14 because he is a hireling, and careth not for the sheep. I am the
  15 good shepherd; and I know mine own, and mine own know me, even as
     the Father knoweth me, and I know the Father; and I lay down my
  16 life for the sheep. And other sheep I have, which are not of this
     fold [_see Ezek. 34:23; 37:24_]: them also I must [4]bring, and
     they shall hear my voice; and [5]they shall become one flock, one
  17 shepherd. Therefore doth the Father love me, because I lay down my
  18 life, that I may take it again. No one [6]taketh it away from me,
     but I lay it down of myself. I have [7]power to lay it down, and I
     have [7]power to take it again. This commandment received I from
     my Father.
  19   There arose a division again among the Jews because of these
  20 words. And many of them said, He hath a [8]devil, and is mad; why
  21 hear ye him? Others said, These are not the sayings of one
     possessed with a [8]devil. Can a [8]devil open the eyes of the
     blind?

Sect. 102. MISSION OF THE SEVENTY. CHRIST'S JOY IN THEIR WORK ON THEIR
RETURN

(Compare Mission of the Twelve in Sect. 70.)

Probably in Judea


  Luke 10:1-24

   1   Now after these things the Lord appointed seventy[1] others, and
     sent them two and two before his face into every city and place,
   2 whither he himself was about to come. And he said unto them, The
     harvest is plenteous, but the labourers are few: pray ye therefore
     the Lord of the harvest, that he send forth labourers into his
   3 harvest. Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs in the
   4 midst of wolves. Carry no purse, no wallet, no shoes: and salute
   5 no man on the way. And into whatsoever house ye shall [2]enter,
   6 first say, Peace _be_ to this house. And if a son of peace be
     there, your peace shall rest upon [3]him: but if not, it shall
   7 turn to you again. And in that same house remain, eating and
     drinking such things as they give: for the labourer is worthy of
   8 his hire. Go not from house to house. And into whatsoever city ye
     enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before
   9 you: and heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The
  10 kingdom of God is come nigh unto you. But into whatsoever city ye
     shall enter, and they receive you not, go out into the streets
  11 thereof and say, Even the dust from your city, that cleaveth to
     our feet, we do wipe off against you: howbeit know this, that the
  12 kingdom of God is come nigh. I say unto you, It shall be more
     tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city [_see Gen.
  13 19:24_]. Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if
     the [4]mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which were
     done in you, they would have repented long ago, sitting in
  14 sackcloth and ashes. Howbeit it shall be more tolerable for Tyre
  15 and Sidon in the judgement, than for you. And thou, Capernaum,
     shalt thou be exalted unto heaven? thou shalt be brought down unto
  16 Hades [_see Isa. 14:13-15_]. He that heareth you heareth me; and
     he that rejecteth you rejecteth me; and he that rejecteth me
     rejecteth him that sent me.
  17   And the seventy returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the
  18 [5]devils are subject unto us in thy name. And he said unto them,
  19 I beheld Satan fallen as lightning from heaven. Behold, I have
     given you authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and over
     all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall in any wise hurt
  20 you. Howbeit in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject
     unto you; but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.
  21   In that same hour he rejoiced [6]in the Holy Spirit, and said, I
     [7]thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou didst
     hide these things from the wise and understanding, and didst
     reveal them unto babes: yea, Father; [8]for so it was
  22 well-pleasing in thy sight. All things have been delivered unto me
     of my Father: and no one knoweth who the Son is, save the Father;
     and who the Father is, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son
  23 willeth to reveal _him_. And turning to the disciples, he said
     privately, Blessed _are_ the eyes which see the things that ye see:
  24 for I say unto you, that many prophets and kings desired to see
     the things which ye see, and saw them not; and to hear the things
     which ye hear, and heard them not.

Sect. 103. JESUS ANSWERS A LAWYER'S QUESTION AS TO ETERNAL LIFE, GIVING
THE PARABLE OF THE GOOD SAMARITAN

Probably in Judea


  Luke 10:25-37

  25   And behold, a certain lawyer stood up and tempted him, saying,
  26 [1]Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? And he said
  27 unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou? And he
     answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God [2]with all thy
     heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with
     all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself [_see Deut. 6:5; Lev.
  28 19:18_]. And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do,
  29 and thou shalt live [_see Lev. 18:5_]. But he, desiring to justify
  30 himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour? Jesus made
     answer and said, A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to
     Jericho; and he fell among robbers, which both stripped him and
  31 beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead. And by chance a
     certain priest was going down that way: and when he saw him, he
  32 passed by on the other side. And in like manner a Levite also,
     when he came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other
  33 side. But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was:
  34 and when he saw him, he was moved with compassion, and came to
     him, and bound up his wounds, pouring on _them_ oil and wine; and
     he set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took
  35 care of him. And on the morrow he took out two [3]pence, and gave
     them to the host, and said, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou
  36 spendest more, I, when I come back again, will repay thee. Which
     of these three, thinkest thou, proved neighbour unto him that fell
  37 among the robbers? And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. And
     Jesus said unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.

     [Footnote 1: Or, _Teacher_.]

     seventeen cents.]




Sect. 104. JESUS THE GUEST OF MARTHA AND MARY

Bethany, near Jerusalem[a]


  Luke 10:38-42

  38   Now as they went on their way, he entered into a certain village:
  39 and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house. And
     she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at the Lord's feet,
  40 and heard his word. But Martha was [1]cumbered about much serving;
     and she came up to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my
     sister did leave me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she
  41 help me. But the Lord answered and said unto her, [2]Martha,
  42 Martha, thou art anxious and troubled about many things: [3]but
     one thing is needful: for Mary hath chosen the good part, which
     shall not be taken away from her.

     [Footnote 1: Gr. _distracted_.]

     [Footnote 2: A few ancient authorities read, _Martha, Martha, thou
     art troubled: Mary hath chosen etc._]

     [Footnote 3: Many ancient authorities read _but few things are
     needful, or one_.]

[Footnote a: There was another Bethany beyond Jordan (John 1:28, Sect.
26). We shall see Jesus in Bethany near Jerusalem again (John 12:1-8). It
was his Jerusalem home in the early days of Passion Week.]




Sect. 105. JESUS AGAIN GIVES A MODEL OF PRAYER (COMP. SECT. 54), AND
ENCOURAGES HIS DISCIPLES TO PRAY. PARABLE OF THE IMPORTUNATE FRIEND

Probably in Judea


  Luke 11:1-13

   1   And it came to pass, as he was praying in a certain place, that
     when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us
   2 to pray, even as John also taught his disciples. And he said unto
     them, When ye pray, say, [1]Father, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy
   3 kingdom come.[2] Give us day by day [3]our daily bread. And
   4 forgive us our sins; for we ourselves also forgive every one that
     is indebted to us. And bring us not into temptation[4].[a]
   5   And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and
     shall go unto him at midnight, and say to him, Friend, lend me
   6 three loaves; for a friend of mine is come to me from a journey,
   7 and I have nothing to set before him; and he from within shall
     answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my
   8 children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee? I say
     unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his
     friend, yet because of his importunity he will arise and give him
   9 [5]as many as he needeth. And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be
     given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened
  10 unto you. For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh
  11 findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. And of which
     of you that is a father shall his son ask [6]a loaf, and he give
  12 him a stone? or a fish, and he for a fish give him a serpent? Or
  13 _if_ he shall ask an egg, will he give him a scorpion? If ye then,
     being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how
     much more shall _your_ heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to
     them that ask him?

     [Footnote 1: Many ancient authorities read _Our Father, which art
     in heaven._ See Matt. 6:9.]

     [Footnote 2: Many ancient authorities add _Thy will be done, as in
     heaven, so on earth._ See Matt. 6:10.]

     [Footnote 3: Gr. _our bread for the coming day_.]

     [Footnote 4: Many ancient authorities add _but deliver us from the
     evil_ one (or, _from evil_). See Matt. 6:13.]

     [Footnote 6: Some ancient authorities omit _a loaf, and he give
     him a stone? or_.]

54), but the ideas are the same. Evidently the disciples were slow to
learn Christ's teaching about prayer.]




Sect. 106. BLASPHEMOUS ACCUSATION OF LEAGUE WITH BEELZEBUB

(Compare Sect. 61)[a]

Probably in Judea


  Luke 11:14-36

  14   And he was casting out a [1]devil _which was_ dumb. And it came
     to pass, when the [1]devil was gone out, the dumb man spake; and
  15 the multitudes marvelled. But some of them said, [2]By Beelzebub
  16 the prince of the [3]devils casteth he out [3]devils. And others,
  17 tempting _him_, sought of him a sign from heaven. But he, knowing
     their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom divided against
     itself is brought to desolation; [4]and a house _divided_ against a
  18 house falleth. And if Satan also is divided against himself, how
     shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out [3]devils
  19 [2]by Beelzebub. And if I [2]by Beelzebub cast out [3]devils, by
     whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your
  20 judges. But if I by the finger of God cast out [3]devils, then is
  21 the kingdom of God come upon you. When the strong _man_ fully
  22 armed guardeth his own court, his goods are in peace: but when a
     stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh
     from him his whole armour wherein he trusted, and divideth his
  23 spoils. He that is not with me is against me; and he that
  24 gathereth not with me scattereth. The unclean spirit when [5]he is
     gone out of the man, passeth through waterless places, seeking
     rest; and finding none, [5]he saith, I will turn back unto my
  25 house whence I came out. And when [5]he is come, [5]he findeth it
  26 swept and garnished. Then goeth [5]he, and taketh _to him_ seven
     other spirits more evil than [6]himself; and they enter in and
     dwell there: and the last state of that man becometh worse than
     the first.
  27   And it came to pass, as he said these things, a certain woman out
     of the multitude lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed
     is the womb that bare thee, and the breasts which thou didst suck.
  28 But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of
     God, and keep it.
  29   And when the multitudes were gathering together unto him, he
     began to say, This generation is an evil generation: it seeketh
     after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it but the sign
  30 of Jonah [_see Jonah 3:1-4_]. For even as Jonah became a sign unto
     the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of man be to this generation.
  31 The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgement with the men
     of this generation, and shall condemn them: for she came from the
     ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon [_see 1 Kings
  32 10:1-3_]; and behold, [7]a greater than Solomon is here. The men
     of Nineveh shall stand up in the judgement with this generation,
     and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonah
     [_see Jonah 3:5-10_]; and behold, [7]a greater than Jonah is here.
  33   No man, when he hath lighted a lamp, putteth it in a cellar,
     neither under the bushel, but on the stand, that they which enter
  34 in may see the light. The lamp of thy body is thine eye: when
     thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but
  35 when it is evil, thy body also is full of darkness. Look therefore
  36 whether the light that is in thee be not darkness. If therefore
     thy whole body be full of light, having no part dark, it shall be
     wholly full of light, as when the lamp with its bright shining
     doth give thee light.

     [Footnote 7: Gr. _more than_.]

[Footnote a: It is perfectly natural that the blasphemous accusation made
in Galilee (Sect. 61), and probably more than once (Sect. 68, Matt.
9:34), should be repeated a year or so afterward in Judea or Perea, and
that Jesus should make substantially the same argument in reply. This
sort of thing occurs to every travelling religious teacher. Our Lord does
not here give the solemn warning that such an accusation is really
blaspheming against the Holy Spirit, and is unpardonable. (See Luke
12:10.) And the subsequent occurrences are quite different in the two
cases. In Sect. 64 he afterwards goes out by the lake-side and gives the
great group of parables, presently explaining some of them to the
disciples in a house, and then crosses the lake to Gerasa, etc. Here in
Sect. 107 he breakfasts with a Pharisee, and utters such solemn woes
against the Pharisees as are found only in the closing months of his
ministry, and then gives to vast multitudes a series of instructions
wholly unlike the great group of parables. So it is quite unsuitable to
identify this occurrence with that of Sect. 61.]




Sect. 107. WHILE BREAKFASTING WITH A PHARISEE, JESUS SEVERELY DENOUNCES
THE PHARISEES AND LAWYERS, AND EXCITES THEIR ENMITY

Probably in Judea


  Luke 11:37-54

  37   Now as he spake, a Pharisee asketh him to [1]dine with him: and
  38 he went in, and sat down to meat. And when the Pharisee saw it, he
  39 marvelled that he had not washed before [1]dinner. And the Lord
     said unto him, Now do ye Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup
     and of the platter; but your inward part is full of extortion and
  40 wickedness. Ye foolish ones, did not he that made the outside make
  41 the inside also? Howbeit give for alms those things which [2]are
     within; and behold, all things are clean unto you.
  42   But woe unto you Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and every
     herb, and pass over judgement and the love of God [_see Lev.
     27:30; Mic. 6:8_]: but these ought ye to have done, and not to
  43 leave the other undone. Woe unto you Pharisees! for ye love the
     chief seats in the synagogues, and the salutations in the
  44 marketplaces. Woe unto you! for ye are as the tombs which appear
     not, and the men that walk over _them_ know it not.
  45   And one of the lawyers answering saith unto him, [3]Master, in
  46 saying this thou reproachest us also. And he said, Woe unto you
     lawyers also! for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne,
     and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers.
  47 Woe unto you! for ye build the tombs of the prophets, and your
  48 fathers killed them. So ye are witnesses and consent unto the
     works of your fathers: for they killed them, and ye build _their
  49 tombs_. Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send unto
     them prophets and apostles; and _some_ of them they shall kill and
  50 persecute; that the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from
     the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;
  51 from the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zachariah [_see Gen. 4:8;
     2 Chron. 24:20-21_], who perished between the altar and the
     [4]sanctuary: yea, I say unto you, it shall be required of this
  52 generation. Woe unto you lawyers! for ye took away the key of
     knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were
     entering in ye hindered.
  53   And when he was come out from thence, the scribes and the
     Pharisees began to [5]press upon _him_ vehemently, and to provoke
  54 him to speak of [6]many things; laying wait for him, to catch
     something out of his mouth.

COVETOUSNESS (PARABLE OF THE RICH FOOL), WORLDLY ANXIETIES, WATCHFULNESS
(PARABLE OF THE WAITING SERVANTS, AND OF THE WISE STEWARD), AND HIS OWN
APPROACHING PASSION[a]

Probably in Judea


  Luke 12

   1   In the mean time, when [1]the many thousands of the multitude
     were gathered together, insomuch that they trode one upon another,
     he began to [2]say unto his disciples first of all, Beware ye of
   2 the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. But there is
     nothing covered up, that shall not be revealed: and hid, that shall
   3 not be known. Wherefore whatsoever ye have said in the darkness
     shall be heard in the light; and what ye have spoken in the ear in
   4 the inner chambers shall be proclaimed upon the housetops. And I
     say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them which kill the body,
   5 and after that have no more that they can do. But I will warn you
     whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after he hath killed hath
   6 [3]power to cast into [4]hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him. Are
     not five sparrows sold for two farthings? and not one of them is
   7 forgotten in the sight of God. But the very hairs of your head are
     all numbered. Fear not: ye are of more value than many sparrows.
   8 And I say unto you, Every one who shall confess [5]me before men,
     [6]him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God:
   9 but he that denieth me in the presence of men shall be denied in
  10 the presence of the angels of God. And every one who shall speak a
     word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but unto
     him that blasphemeth against the Holy Spirit it shall not be
  11 forgiven. And when they bring you before the synagogues, and the
     rulers, and the authorities, be not anxious how or what ye shall
  12 answer, or what ye shall say: for the Holy Spirit shall teach you
     in that very hour what ye ought to say.
  13   And one out of the multitude said unto him, [7]Master, bid my
  14 brother divide the inheritance with me. But he said unto him, Man,
  15 who made me a judge or a divider over you? And he said unto them,
     Take heed, and keep yourselves from all covetousness: [8]for a
     man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he
  16 possesseth. And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground
  17 of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully: and he reasoned
     within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have not where
  18 to bestow my fruits? And he said, This will I do: I will pull down
     my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my corn
  19 and my goods. And I will say to my [9]soul, [9]Soul, thou hast
     much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, be
  20 merry. But God said unto him, Thou foolish one, this night [10]is
     thy [9]soul required of thee; and the things which thou hast
  21 prepared, whose shall they be? So is he that layeth up treasure
     for himself, and is not rich toward God.
  22   And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Be not
     anxious for _your_ [11]life, what ye shall eat; nor yet for your
  23 body, what ye shall put on. For the [11]life is more than the
  24 food, and the body than the raiment. Consider the ravens, that
     they sow not, neither reap; which have no store-chamber nor barn;
     and God feedeth them: of how much more value are ye than the
  25 birds! And which of you by being anxious can add a cubit unto his
  26 [12]stature? If then ye are not able to do even that which is
  27 least, why are ye anxious concerning the rest? Consider the
     lilies, how they grow: they toil not, neither do they spin; yet I
     say unto you, Even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like
  28 one of these. But if God doth so clothe the grass in the field,
     which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven; how much
  29 more _shall he clothe_ you, O ye of little faith? And seek not ye
     what ye shall eat, and what ye shall drink, neither be ye of
  30 doubtful mind. For all these things do the nations of the world
     seek after: but your Father knoweth that ye have need of these
  31 things. Howbeit seek ye [13]his kingdom, and these things shall be
  32 added unto you. Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's
  33 good pleasure to give you the kingdom. Sell that ye have, and give
     alms; make for yourselves purses which wax not old, a treasure in
     the heavens that faileth not, where no thief draweth near, neither
  34 moth destroyeth. For where your treasure is, there will your heart
     be also.
  35,36 Let your loins be girded about, and your lamps burning; and be
     ye yourselves like unto men looking for their lord, when he shall
     return from the marriage feast; that, when he cometh and knocketh,
  37 they may straightway open unto him. Blessed are those
     [14]servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching:
     verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them
  38 sit down to meat, and shall come and serve them. And if he shall
     come in the second watch, and if in the third, and find _them_ so,
  39 blessed are those _servants_. [15]But know this, that if the
     master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming,
     he would have watched, and not have left his house to be
  40 [16]broken through. Be ye also ready: for in an hour that ye think
     not the Son of man cometh.
  41   And Peter said, Lord, speakest thou this parable unto us, or even
  42 unto all? And the Lord said, Who then is [17]the faithful and wise
     steward, whom his lord shall set over his household, to give them
  43 their portion of food in due season? Blessed is that [18]servant,
  44 whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing. Of a truth I say
  45 unto you, that he will set him over all that he hath. But if that
     [18]servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming;
     and shall begin to beat the menservants and the maidservants, and
  46 to eat and drink, and to be drunken; the lord of that [18]servant
     shall come in a day when he expecteth not, and in an hour when he
     knoweth not, and shall [19]cut him asunder, and appoint his
  47 portion with the unfaithful. And that [18]servant, which knew his
     lord's will, and made not ready, nor did according to his will,
  48 shall be beaten with many _stripes_; but he that knew not, and did
     things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few _stripes_. And
     to whomsoever much is given, of him shall much be required: and to
     whom they commit much, of him will they ask the more.
  49   I came to cast fire upon the earth; and what will I, if it is
  50 already kindled? But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how
  51 am I straitened till it be accomplished! Think ye that I am come
     to give peace in the earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division:
  52 for there shall be from henceforth five in one house divided,
  53 three against two, and two against three [_see Mic. 7:6_]. They
     shall be divided, father against son, and son against father;
     mother against daughter, and daughter against her mother; mother
     in law against her daughter in law, and daughter in law against
     her mother in law.
  54   And he said to the multitudes also, When ye see a cloud rising in
     the west, straightway ye say, There cometh a shower; and so it
  55 cometh to pass. And when _ye see_ a south wind blowing, ye say,
  56 There will be a [20]scorching heat; and it cometh to pass. Ye
     hypocrites, ye know how to [21]interpret the face of the earth and
     the heaven; but how is it that ye know not how to [21]interpret
  57 this time? And why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right?
  58 For as thou art going with thine adversary before the magistrate,
     on the way give diligence to be quit of him; lest haply he hale
     thee unto the judge, and the judge shall deliver thee to the
  59 [22]officer, and the [22]officer shall cast thee into prison. I
     say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou
     have paid the very last mite.

Sect. 109. ALL MUST REPENT OR PERISH (TWO CURRENT TRAGEDIES); PARABLE OF
THE BARREN FIG TREE

Probably in Judea


  Luke 13:1-9

   1   Now there were some present at that very season which told him of
     the Galileans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their
   2 sacrifices. And he answered and said unto them, Think ye that
     these Galileans were sinners above all the Galileans, because they
   3 have suffered these things? I tell you, Nay: but, except ye
   4 repent, ye shall all in like manner perish. Or those eighteen,
     upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and killed them, think ye that
     they were [1]offenders above all the men that dwell in Jerusalem?
   5 I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise
     perish.
   6   And he spake this parable; A certain man had a fig tree
     planted in his vineyard; and he came seeking fruit thereon, and
   7 found none. And he said unto the vinedresser, Behold, these three
     years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it
   8 down; why doth it also cumber the ground? And he answering saith
     unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig
   9 about it, and dung it: and if it bear fruit thenceforth, _well_;
     but if not, thou shalt cut it down.

Sect. 110. JESUS HEALS A CRIPPLED WOMAN ON THE SABBATH AND DEFENDS
HIMSELF AGAINST THE RULER OF THE SYNAGOGUE (COMP. SECTS. 49 TO 51 AND
114). REPETITION OF THE PARABLES OF THE MUSTARD SEED AND OF THE LEAVEN


  Luke 13:10-21

  10   And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath day.
  11 And behold, a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen
     years; and she was bowed together, and could in no wise lift
  12 herself up. And when Jesus saw her, he called her, and said to
  13 her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity. And he laid his
     hands upon her: and immediately she was made straight, and
  14 glorified God. And the ruler of the synagogue, being moved with
     indignation because Jesus had healed on the sabbath [_see Ex.
     20:8-11; Deut. 5:12-15_], answered and said to the multitude,
     There are six days in which men ought to work: in them therefore
  15 come and be healed, and not on the day of the sabbath. But the
     Lord answered him, and said, Ye hypocrites, doth not each one of
     you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the [1]stall, and
  16 lead him away to watering? And ought not this woman, being a
     daughter of Abraham, whom Satan had bound, lo, _these_ eighteen
     years, to have been loosed from this bond on the day of the
  17 sabbath? And as he said these things, all his adversaries were put
     to shame: and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious
     things that were done by him.
  18   He said therefore, Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and
  19 whereunto shall I liken it? It is like unto a grain of mustard
     seed, which a man took, and cast into his own garden; and it grew,
     and became a tree; and the birds of the heaven lodged in the
  20 branches thereof [_see Dan. 4:10-12; 20-22_]. And again he said,
  21 Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God? It is like unto
     leaven, which a woman took and hid in three [2]measures of meal,
     till it was all leavened.

     [Footnote 1: Gr. _manger_.]

     [Footnote 2: The word in the Gr. denotes the Hebrew seah, a
     measure containing nearly a peck and a half (cf. in Matt. 13:33).]

Sect. 111. AT THE FEAST OF DEDICATION, JESUS WILL NOT YET OPENLY SAY THAT
HE IS THE MESSIAH. THE JEWS TRY TO STONE HIM

Jerusalem


  John 10:22-39

  22   [1]And it was the feast of the dedication at Jerusalem:[a] it was
  23 winter; and Jesus was walking in the temple in Solomon's porch.
  24 The Jews therefore came round about him, and said unto him, How
     long dost thou hold us in suspense? If thou art the Christ, tell
  25 us plainly. Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believe not:
     the works that I do in my Father's name, these bear witness of me.
  26 But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep. My sheep hear
  27 my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: and I give unto
  28 them eternal life; and they shall never perish, and no one shall
  29 snatch them out of my hand. [2]My Father, which hath given _them_
     unto me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch
  30 [3]_them_ out of the Father's hand. I and the Father are one. The
  31 Jews took up stones again to stone him. Jesus answered them, Many
  32 good works have I shewed you from the Father; for which of those
  33 works do ye stone me? The Jews answered him, For a good work we
     stone thee not, but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a
  34 man, makest thyself God. Jesus answered them, Is it not written in
  35 your law, I said, Ye are gods [_see Ps. 82:6_]? If he called them
     gods, unto whom the word of God came (and the scripture cannot be
  36 broken), say ye of him, whom the Father [4]sanctified and sent
     into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am _the_ Son
  37 of God? If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not. But if
  38 I do them, though you believe not me, believe the works: that ye
     may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the
  39 Father. They sought again to take him: and he went forth out of
     their hand.

     feast_.]

     hath given unto me_.]

     [Footnote 3: Or, _aught_.]

     [Footnote 4: Or, _consecrated_.]

[Footnote a: Some scholars think that the events in John 9 and 10:1-21
belong to the time of the feast of dedication rather than soon after
tabernacles. But the language of John 10:24 seems to call for an
interval.]

  40   And he went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John
  41 was at the first baptizing; and there he abode. And many came unto
     him; and they said, John indeed did no sign: but all things
  42 whatsoever John spake of this man were true. And many believed on
     him there.




Sect. 113. TEACHING IN PEREA, ON A JOURNEY[a] TOWARD JERUSALEM. WARNED
AGAINST HEROD ANTIPAS


  Luke 13:22-35

  22   And he went on his way through cities and villages, teaching, and
  23 journeying on unto Jerusalem.[b] And one said unto him, Lord, are
  24 they few that be saved? And he said unto them, Strive to enter in
     by the narrow door: for many, I say unto you, shall seek to enter
  25 in, and shall not be [1]able. When once the master of the house is
     risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand
     without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, open to us; and
  26 he shall answer and say to you, I know you not whence ye are; then
     shall ye begin to say, We did eat and drink in thy presence, and
  27 thou didst teach in our streets; and he shall say, I tell you, I
     know not whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity
  28 [_see Ps. 6:8_]. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth,
     when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the
     prophets, in the kingdom of God, and yourselves cast forth
  29 without. And they shall come from the east and west, and from the
     north and south, and shall [2]sit down in the kingdom of God [_see
  30 Ps. 107:3; Isa. 49:12_]. And behold, there are last which shall be
     first, and there are first which shall be last.
  31   In that very hour there came certain Pharisees, saying to him,
  32 Get thee out, and go hence: for Herod would fain kill thee. And he
     said unto them, Go and say to that fox, Behold, I cast out
     [3]devils and perform cures to-day and to-morrow, and the third
  33 _day_ I am perfected. Howbeit I must go on my way to-day and
     to-morrow and the _day_ following: for it cannot be that a prophet
  34 perish out of Jerusalem. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killeth the
     prophets, and stoneth them that are sent unto her! how often would
     I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen _gathereth_
  35 her own brood under her wings, and ye would not! Behold, your
     house is left unto you _desolate_: and I say unto you, Ye shall
     not see me, until ye shall say, Blessed _is_ he that cometh in the
     name of the Lord [_see Ps. 118:26; Jer. 12:7; 22:5_].

and John. After the Feast of the Dedication Jesus retired beyond Jordan
(John 10:40), whence he goes to the raising of Lazarus (John 11:17). Luke
seems to give incidents that belong to this journey.]

[Footnote b: The period of three to four months from the Dedication to
the final Passover is divided by another visit to Jerusalem. We cannot
tell how many weeks preceded this event. All along here we have only a
few specimens of the Saviour's teaching and works.]




Sect. 114. WHILE DINING (BREAKFASTING) WITH A CHIEF PHARISEE, HE AGAIN
HEALS ON THE SABBATH, AND DEFENDS HIMSELF (COMP. SECTS. 49 TO 51 AND
110). THREE PARABLES SUGGESTED BY THE OCCASION

Probably in Perea


  Luke 14:1-24

   1   And it came to pass, when he went into the house of one of the
     rulers of the Pharisees on a sabbath to eat bread, that they were
   2 watching him. And behold, there was before him a certain man which
   3 had the dropsy. And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and
     Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath, or not?
   4 But they held their peace. And he took him, and healed him, and
   5 let him go. And he said unto them, Which of you shall have [1]an
     ass or an ox fallen into a well, and will not straightway draw him
   6 up on a sabbath day? And they could not answer again unto these
     things.
   7   And he spake a parable unto those which were bidden, when he
   8 marked how they chose out the chief seats; saying unto them, When
     thou art bidden of any man to a marriage feast, [2]sit not down in
     the chief seat; lest haply a more honourable man than thou be
   9 bidden of him, and he that bade thee and him shall come and say to
     thee, Give this man place; and then thou shalt begin with shame to
  10 take the lowest place. But when thou art bidden, go and sit down
     in the lowest place; that when he that hath bidden thee cometh, he
     may say to thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have glory
     in the presence of all that sit at meat with thee. For every one
  11 that exalteth himself shall be humbled; and he that humbleth
     himself shall be exalted.
  12   And he said to him also that had bidden him, When thou makest a
     dinner or a supper,[a] call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, nor
     thy kinsmen, nor rich neighbours; lest haply they also bid thee
  13 again, and a recompense be made thee. But when thou makest a
  14 feast, bid the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind: and thou
     shalt be blessed; because they have not _wherewith_ to recompense
     thee: for thou shalt be recompensed in the resurrection of the
     just.
  15   And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these
     things, he said unto him, Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the
  16 kingdom of God. But he said unto him, A certain man made a great
  17 supper; and he bade many: and he sent forth his [3]servant at
     supper time to say to them that were bidden, Come; for _all_
  18 things are now ready. And they all with one _consent_ began to
     make excuse. The first said unto him, I have bought a field, and I
  19 must needs go out and see it: I pray thee have me excused. And
     another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove
  20 them: I pray thee have me excused. And another said, I have
  21 married a wife, and therefore I cannot come. And the [3]servant
     came, and told his lord these things. Then the master of the house
     being angry said to his [3]servant, Go out quickly into the
     streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor and
  22 maimed and blind and lame. And the [3]servant said, Lord, what
  23 thou didst command is done, and yet there is room. And the lord
     said unto the [3]servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and
  24 constrain _them_ to come in, that my house may be filled. For I
     say unto you, that none of those men which were bidden shall taste
     of my supper.

     [Footnote 1: Many ancient authorities read _a son_. See ch.
     13:15.]

     [Footnote 2: Gr. _recline not_.]

     [Footnote 3: Gr. _bondservant_.]

[Footnote a: More exactly, "a breakfast or a dinner." The two principal
meals of the Jews answered to the present English breakfast (in the
forenoon and often near noon), and dinner (at or after dark); and so in
our cities. In the time of King James, as in many of our country homes
now, the meal towards noon answered to dinner, and the night meal to
supper. Hence a certain confusion in the older and more recent English
versions. In verses 16, 17 the right word would be dinner, according to
city usage, and so elsewhere.]




Sect. 115. GREAT CROWDS FOLLOW HIM, AND HE WARNS THEM TO COUNT THE COST
OF DISCIPLESHIP TO HIM (COMP. SECTS. 70 and 83)

Probably in Perea


  Luke 14:25-35

  25   Now there went with him great multitudes: and he turned, and said
  26 unto them, If any man cometh unto me, and hateth not his own
     father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and
     sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.
  27 Whosoever doth not bear his own cross, and come after me, cannot
  28 be my disciple. For which of you, desiring to build a tower, doth
     not first sit down and count the cost, whether he have _wherewith_
  29 to complete it? Lest haply, when he hath laid a foundation, and is
  30 not able to finish, all that behold begin to mock him, saying,
  31 This man began to build, and was not able to finish. Or what king,
     as he goeth to encounter another king in war, will not sit down
     first and take counsel whether he is able with ten thousand to
  32 meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand? Or else,
     while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an ambassage,
  33 and asketh conditions of peace. So therefore whosoever he be of
     you that renounceth not all that he hath, he cannot be my
  34 disciple. Salt therefore is good: but if even the salt have lost
  35 its savour, wherewith shall it be seasoned? It is fit neither for
     the land nor for the dunghill: _men_ cast it out. He that hath
     ears to hear, let him hear.




Sect. 116. THE PHARISEES AND THE SCRIBES MURMUR AGAINST JESUS FOR
RECEIVING SINNERS. HE DEFENDS HIMSELF BY THREE GREAT PARABLES (THE LOST
SHEEP, THE LOST COIN, THE LOST SON)

Probably in Perea


  Luke 15:1-32

   1   Now all the publicans and sinners were drawing near unto him for
   2 to hear him. And both the Pharisees and the scribes murmured,
     saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.
  3, 4 And he spake unto them this parable, saying, What man of you,
     having a hundred sheep, and having lost one of them, doth not
     leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that
   5 which is lost, until he find it? And when he hath found it, he
   6 layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing. And when he cometh home, he
     calleth together his friends and his neighbours, saying unto them,
   7 Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost. I say
     unto you, that even so there shall be joy in heaven over one
     sinner that repenteth, _more_ than over ninety and nine righteous
     persons, which need no repentance.
   8   Or what woman having ten [1]pieces of silver, if she lose one
     piece, doth not light a lamp, and sweep the house, and seek
   9 diligently until she find it? And when she hath found it, she
     calleth together her friends and neighbours, saying, Rejoice with
  10 me, for I have found the piece which I had lost. Even so, I say
     unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over
     one sinner that repenteth.
  11, 12  And he said, A certain man had two sons: and the younger of
     them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of [2]_thy_
     substance that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his living.
  13 And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and
     took his journey into a far country; and there he wasted his
  14 substance with riotous living. And when he had spent all, there
     arose a mighty famine in that country; and he began to be in want.
  15 And he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that
  16 country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine. And he
     would fain have been filled with [3]the husks that the swine did
  17 eat: and no man gave unto him. But when he came to himself he
     said, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and
  18 to spare, and I perish here with hunger! I will arise and go to my
     father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against
  19 heaven, and in thy sight: I am no more worthy to be called thy
  20 son: make me as one of thy hired servants. And he arose, and came
     to his father. But while he was yet afar off, his father saw him,
     and was moved with compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and
  21 [4]kissed him. And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned
     against heaven, and in thy sight: I am no more worthy to be called
  22 thy son.[5] But the father said to his [6]servants, Bring forth
     quickly the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his
  23 hand, and shoes on his feet: and bring the fatted calf, _and_ kill
  24 it, and let us eat, and make merry: for this my son was dead, and
     is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be
  25 merry. Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew
  26 nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing. And he called to
     him one of the [6]servants, and inquired what these things might
  27 be. And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath
     killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and
  28 sound. But he was angry, and would not go in: and his father came
  29 out, and intreated him. But he answered and said to his father,
     Lo, these many years do I serve thee, and I never transgressed a
     commandment of thine: and _yet_ thou never gavest me a kid, that I
  30 might make merry with my friends: but when this thy son came,
     which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou killedst for him
  31 the fatted calf. And he said unto him, [7]Son, thou art ever with
  32 me, and all that is mine is thine. But it was meet to make merry
     and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive _again_;
     and _was_ lost, and is found.

Sect. 117. THREE PARABLES ON STEWARDSHIP (TO THE DISCIPLES, THE PARABLE
OF THE UNJUST STEWARD; TO THE PHARISEES, THE PARABLE OF THE RICH MAN AND
LAZARUS; TO THE DISCIPLES, THE PARABLE OF THE UNPROFITABLE SERVANTS)

Probably in Perea


  Luke 16:1-17:10

   1   And he said also unto the disciples, There was a certain rich
     man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he
   2 was wasting his goods. And he called him, and said unto him, What
     is this that I hear of thee? render the account of thy stewardship;
   3 for thou canst be no longer steward. And the steward said within
     himself, What shall I do, seeing that my lord taketh away the
     stewardship from me? I have not strength to dig; to beg I am
   4 ashamed. I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the
   5 stewardship, they may receive me into their houses. And calling to
     him each one of his lord's debtors, he said to the first, How much
   6 owest thou unto my lord? And he said, A hundred [1]measures of
     oil. And he said unto him, Take thy [2]bond, and sit down quickly
   7 and write fifty. Then said he to another, And how much owest thou?
     And he said, A hundred [3]measures of wheat. He saith unto him,
   8 Take thy [2]bond, and write fourscore. And his lord commended
     [4]the unrighteous steward because he had done wisely: for the
     sons of this [5]world are for their own generation wiser than the
   9 sons of the light. And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends
     [6]by means of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when it shall
  10 fail, they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles. He that
     is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much: and he that
  11 is unrighteous in a very little is unrighteous also in much. If
     therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who
  12 will commit to your trust the true _riches_? And if ye have not
     been faithful in that which is another's, who will give you that
  13 which is [7]your own? No [8]servant can serve two masters: for
     either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will
     hold to one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and
     mammon.
  14   And the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all these
  15 things; and they scoffed at him. And he said unto them, Ye are
     they that justify yourselves in the sight of men; but God knoweth
     your hearts: for that which is exalted among men is an abomination
  16 in the sight of God. The law and the prophets _were_ until John:
     from that time the gospel of the kingdom of God is preached, and
  17 every man entereth violently into it [_see Matt. 11:12_]. But it
     is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one tittle
  18 of the law to fall. Every one that putteth away his wife, and
     marrieth another, committeth adultery: and he that marrieth one
     that is put away from a husband committeth adultery.
  19   Now there was a certain rich man, and he was clothed in purple
  20 and fine linen, [9]faring sumptuously every day: and a certain
  21 beggar named Lazarus was laid at his gate, full of sores, and
     desiring to be fed with the _crumbs_ that fell from the rich man's
  22 table; yea, even the dogs came and licked his sores. And it came to
     pass, that the beggar died, and that he was carried away by the
     angels into Abraham's bosom: and the rich man also died, and was
  23 buried. And in Hades he lifted up his eyes, being in torments, and
  24 seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. And he cried and
     said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he
     may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I
  25 am in anguish in this flame. But Abraham said, [10]Son, remember
     that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and Lazarus
     in like manner evil things: but now here he is comforted, and thou
  26 art in anguish. And [11]beside all this, between us and you there
     is a great gulf fixed, that they which would pass from hence to
     you may not be able, and that none may cross over from thence to
  27 us. And he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest
  28 send him to my father's house; for I have five brethren; that he
     may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of
  29 torment. But Abraham saith, They have Moses and the prophets; let
  30 them hear them. And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one go to
  31 them from the dead, they will repent. And he said unto him, If
     they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be
     persuaded, if one rise from the dead.
   1   And he said unto his disciples, It is impossible but that
     occasions of stumbling should come: but woe unto him, through whom
   2 they come! It were well for him if a millstone were hanged about
     his neck, and he were thrown into the sea, rather than that he
   3 should cause one of these little ones to stumble. Take heed to
     yourselves: if thy brother sin, rebuke him; and if he repent,
   4 forgive him. And if he sin against thee seven times in the day,
     and seven times turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt
     forgive him.
  5, 6   And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith. And
     the Lord said, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye
     would say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou rooted up, and be thou
   7 planted in the sea; and it would have obeyed you. But who is there
     of you, having a [12]servant plowing or keeping sheep, that will
     say unto him, when he is come in from the field, Come straightway
   8 and sit down to meat; and will not rather say unto him, Make ready
     wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have
   9 eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink? Doth he
     thank the [12]servant because he did the things that were
  10 commanded? Even so ye also, when ye shall have done all the things
     that are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable [13]servants; we
     have done that which it was our duty to do.

Sect. 118. JESUS RAISES LAZARUS FROM THE DEAD

From Perea[a] to Bethany near Jerusalem


  John 11:1-44

   1   Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus of Bethany, of the village of
   2 Mary and her sister Martha. And it was that Mary which anointed
     the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose
   3 brother Lazarus was sick. The sisters therefore sent unto him,
   4 saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick. But when Jesus
     heard it, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the
   5 glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified thereby. Now
   6 Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. When therefore he
     heard that he was sick, he abode at that time two days in the
   7 place where he was. Then after this he saith to the disciples, Let
   8 us go into Judea again. The disciples say unto him, Rabbi, the
     Jews were but now seeking to stone thee; and goest thou thither
   9 again? Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If a
     man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light
  10 of this world. But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth,
  11 because the light is not in him. These things spake he: and after
     this he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus is fallen asleep; but
  12 I go, that I may awake him out of sleep. The disciples therefore
     said unto him, Lord, if he is fallen asleep, he will [1]recover.
  13 Now Jesus had spoken of his death: but they thought that he spake
  14 of taking rest in sleep. Then Jesus therefore said unto them
  15 plainly, Lazarus is dead. And I am glad for your sakes that I was
     not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go
  16 unto him. Thomas therefore, who is called [2]Didymus, said unto
     his fellow-disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.
  17   So when Jesus came, he found that he had been in the tomb four
  18 days already. Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen
  19 furlongs off; and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary, to
  20 console them concerning their brother. Martha therefore, when she
     heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary still sat
  21 in the house. Martha therefore said unto Jesus, Lord, if thou
  22 hadst been here, my brother had not died. And even now I know that,
  23 whatsoever thou shalt ask of God, God will give thee. Jesus saith
  24 unto her, Thy brother shall rise again. Martha saith unto him, I
     know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.
  25 Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that
  26 believeth on me, though he die, yet shall he live: and whosoever
     liveth and believeth on me shall never die. Believest thou this?
  27 She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I have believed that thou art the
  28 Christ, the Son of God, _even_ he that cometh into the world. And
     when she had said this, she went away, and called Mary [3]her
     sister secretly, saying, The [4]Master is here, and calleth thee.
  29 And she, when she heard it, arose quickly, and went unto him. (Now
  30 Jesus was not yet come into the village, but was still in the
  31 place where Martha met him.) The Jews then which were with her in
     the house, and were comforting her, when they saw Mary, that she
     rose up quickly and went out, followed her, supposing that she was
  32 going unto the tomb to [5]weep there. Mary therefore, when she
     came where Jesus was, and saw him, fell down at his feet, saying
     unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.
  33 When Jesus therefore saw her [6]weeping, and the Jews _also_
     [6]weeping which came with her, he [7]groaned in the spirit, and
  34 [8]was troubled, and said, Where have ye laid him? They say unto
  35, 36 him, Lord, come and see. Jesus wept. The Jews therefore said,
  37 Behold how he loved him! But some of them said, Could not this
     man, which opened the eyes of him that was blind, have caused that
  38 this man also should not die? Jesus therefore again [9]groaning in
     himself cometh to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay
  39 [10]against it. Jesus saith, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the
     sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he
  40 stinketh: for he hath been _dead_ four days. Jesus saith unto her,
     Said I not unto thee, that, if thou believedst, thou shouldest see
  41 the glory of God? So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up
     his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou heardest me.
  42 And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the
     multitude which standeth around I said it, that they may believe
  43 that thou didst send me. And when he had thus spoken, he cried
  44 with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth. He that was dead came
     forth, bound hand and foot with [11]grave-clothes; and his face
     was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him,
     and let him go.

[Footnote a: Our Lord was apparently at a distance of two or three days'
journey (verses 6, 17) from Bethany; and he was probably in Perea. This
visit to Bethany, a suburb of Jerusalem, may be that to which Luke
pointed in 13:22.]




Sect. 119. THE EFFECT OF THE RAISING OF LAZARUS (ON THE PEOPLE, ON THE
SANHEDRIN, ON THE MOVEMENTS OF JESUS)

Jerusalem and Ephraim in Judea.


  John 11:45-54

  45   Many therefore of the Jews, which came to Mary and beheld [1]that
  46 which he did, believed on him. But some of them went away to the
     Pharisees, and told them the thing which Jesus had done.
  47   The chief priests therefore and the Pharisees gathered a council,
  48 and said, What do we? for this man doeth many signs. If we let him
     thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans will come
  49 and take away both our place and our nation. But a certain one of
     them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said unto them, Ye
  50 know nothing at all, nor do ye take account that it is expedient
     for you that one man should die for the people, and that the whole
  51 nation perish not. Now this he said not of himself: but being high
     priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the
  52 nation; and not for the nation only, but that he might also gather
     together into one the children of God that are scattered abroad.
  53 So from that day forth they took counsel that they might put him
     to death.
  54   Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews, but
     departed thence into the country near to the wilderness, into a
     city called Ephraim; and there he tarried with the disciples.

     [Footnote 1: Many ancient authorities read _the things which he
     did_.]




Sect. 120. JESUS STARTS ON THE LAST JOURNEY TO JERUSALEM BY WAY OF
SAMARIA AND GALILEE

_He heals the Ten Lepers and explains the Nature of the Kingdom of God to
the Pharisees and the Disciples._

In Samaria or Galilee


  Luke 17:11-37

  11   And it came to pass, [1]as they were on the way to Jerusalem,
  12 that he was passing [2]through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.[a]
     And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men
  13 that were lepers, which stood afar off [_see Lev. 13:45-46_]: and
     they lifted up their voices, saying, Jesus, Master, have mercy on
  14 us. And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go and shew yourselves
     unto the priests [_see Lev. 13:49; 14:1-3_]. And it came to pass,
  15 as they went, they were cleansed. And one of them, when he saw
     that he was healed, turned back, with a loud voice glorifying God;
  16 and he fell upon his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he
  17 was a Samaritan. And Jesus answering said, Were not the ten
  18 cleansed? but where are the nine? [3]Were there none found that
  19 returned to give glory to God, save this [4]stranger? And he said
     unto him, Arise, and go thy way: thy faith hath [5]made thee
     whole.
  20   And being asked by the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God cometh,
     he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with
  21 observation: neither shall they say, Lo, here! or, There! for lo,
     the kingdom of God is [6]within you.
  22   And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye shall
     desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not
  23 see it. And they shall say to you, Lo, there! Lo, here! go not
  24 away, nor follow after _them_: for as the lightning, when it
     lighteneth out of the one part under the heaven, shineth unto the
     other part under heaven; so shall the Son of man be [7]in his day.
  25 But first must he suffer many things and be rejected of this
  26 generation. And as it came to pass in the days of Noah, even so
     shall it be also in the days of the Son of man [_see Gen. 6:11-13;
  27 7:21-23_]. They ate, they drank, they married, they were given in
     marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the
  28 flood came, and destroyed them all. Likewise even as it came to
     pass in the days of Lot; they ate, they drank, they bought, they
  29 sold, they planted, they builded [_see Gen. 18:20-22_]; but in the
     day that Lot went out from Sodom [_see Gen. 19:24-25_] it rained
  30 fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all: after the
     same manner shall it be in the day that the Son of man is revealed.
  31 In that day, he which shall be on the housetop, and his goods in
     the house, let him not go down to take them away: and let him that
  32 is in the field likewise not return back. Remember Lot's wife [_see
  33 Gen. 19:26_]. Whosoever shall seek to gain his [8]life shall lose
  34 it: but whosoever shall lose _his [8]life_ shall [9]preserve it. I
     say unto you, In that night there shall be two men on one bed; the
  35 one shall be taken, and the other shall be left. There shall be two
     women grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other
  37 shall be left[10]. And they answering say unto him, Where, Lord?
     And he said unto them, Where the body _is_, thither will the
     [11]eagles also be gathered together.

     [Footnote 1: Or, _as he was_.]

     [Footnote 2: Or, _between_.]

     [Footnote 3: Or, _There were none found ... save this stranger._]

     [Footnote 4: Or, _alien_.]

     [Footnote 5: Or, _saved thee_.]

     [Footnote 6: Or, _in the midst of you_.]

     [Footnote 7: Some ancient authorities omit _in his day_.]

     [Footnote 8: Or, _soul_.]

     [Footnote 9: Gr. _save it alive_.]

     [Footnote 10: Some ancient authorities add ver. 36 _There shall be
     two men in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other shall
     be left._]

     [Footnote 11: Or, _vultures_.]

[Footnote a: As Ephraim (Sect. 119) was pretty certainly in the northern
part of Judea, it has been reasonably supposed (Wieseler, Clark, and
others) that, when the Passover was approaching, Jesus went from that
region northward through Samaria into the southern or southeastern part
of Galilee, so as to fall in with the pilgrims going from Galilee through
Perea to Jerusalem. We thus again combine Luke's account with that of
John in easy agreement. And this explains Luke's mention of Samaria
first, which would be strange in describing a journey from Galilee
through Samaria to Jerusalem, while the marginal translation, "between
Samaria and Galilee," would he obscure and hard to account for. From this
point he is making his final journey to Jerusalem, for the Passover of
the crucifixion.]




Sect. 121. TWO PARABLES ON PRAYER (THE IMPORTUNATE WIDOW, THE PHARISEE
AND THE PUBLICAN)


  Luke 18:1-14

   1   And he spake a parable unto them to the end that they ought
   2 always to pray, and not to faint; saying, There was in a city a
   3 judge, which feared not God, and regarded not man: and there was a
     widow in that city; and she came oft unto him, saying, [1]Avenge me
   4 of mine adversary. And he would not for a while: but afterward he
   5 said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man; yet
     because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest she
   6 [2]wear me out by her continual coming. And the Lord said, Hear
   7 what [3]the unrighteous judge saith. And shall not God avenge his
     elect, which cry to him day and night, and he is longsuffering
   8 over them? I say unto you, that he will avenge them speedily.
     Howbeit when the Son of man cometh, shall he find [4]faith on the
     earth?
   9   And he spake also this parable unto certain which trusted in
     themselves that they were righteous, and set [5]all others at
  10 nought: Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a
  11 Pharisee, and the other a publican. The Pharisee stood and prayed
     thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as the rest of
  12 men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. I
  13 fast twice in the week; I give tithes of all that I get. But the
     publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes
     unto heaven, but smote his breast, saying, God, [6]be merciful to
  14 me [7]a sinner. I say unto you, This man went down to his house
     justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth
     himself shall be humbled; but he that humbleth himself shall be
     exalted.

Sect. 122. GOING FROM GALILEE THROUGH PEREA,[a] HE TEACHES CONCERNING
DIVORCE

  Mark 10:1-12                      |Matt. 19:1-12

   1   And he arose from thence, and| 1   And it came to pass when
     cometh into the borders of     |   Jesus had finished these words,
     Judea and beyond Jordan: and   |   he parted from Galilee, and came
     multitudes come together unto  |   into the borders of Judea
     him again; and, as he was wont,| 2 beyond Jordan; and great
     he taught them again.          |   multitudes followed him; and he
                                    |   healed them there.
   2   And there came unto him      | 3   And there came unto him
     Pharisees, and asked him, Is it|   [1]Pharisees, tempting him, and
     lawful for a man to put away   |   saying, Is it lawful _for a
   3 _his_ wife? tempting him. And  |   man_ to put away his wife for
     he answered and said unto them,| 4 every cause? And he answered
     What did Moses command you     |   and said, Have ye not read,
   4 [_see Deut. 24:1_]? And they   |
     said, Moses suffered to write a|
     bill of divorcement, and to put|
   5 her away. But Jesus said unto  |
     them, For your hardness of     |
     heart he wrote you this        |
   6 commandment. But from the      |   that he which [2]made _them_
     beginning of the creation, Male|   from the beginning made them
     and female made he them [_see  | 5 male and female, and said, For
   7 Gen. 1:27_]. For this cause    |   this cause shall a man leave
     shall a man leave his father   |   his father and mother, and
     and mother, [5]and shall cleave|   shall cleave to his wife; and
   8 to his wife; and the twain     |   the twain shall become one
     shall become one flesh [_see   | 6 flesh? So that they are no more
     Gen. 2:24_]: so that they are  |   twain, but one flesh. What
     no more twain, but one flesh.  |   therefore God hath joined
   9 What therefore God hath joined |   together, let not man put
     together, let not man put      |   asunder.
  10 asunder. And in the house the  | 7          They say unto him, Why
     disciples asked him again of   |   then did Moses command to give
     this matter.                   |   a bill of divorcement, and to
                                    | 8 put _her_ away? He saith unto
                                    |   them, Moses for your hardness
                                    |   of heart suffered you to put
                                    |   away your wives: but from the
                                    |   beginning it hath not been so.
  11              And he saith unto | 9 And I say unto you, Whosoever
     them, Whosoever shall put away |   shall put away his wife,
     his wife, and marry another,   |   [3]except for fornication, and
     committeth adultery against    |   shall marry another, committeth
  12 her: and if she herself shall  |   adultery: [4]and he that
     put away her husband, and marry|   marrieth her when she is put
     another, she committeth        |10 away committeth adultery. The
     adultery.                      |   disciples say unto him, If the
                                    |   case of the man is so with his
                                    |   wife, it is not expedient to
  11 marry. But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying,
  12 but they to whom it is given. For there are eunuchs, which were so
     born from their mother's womb: and there are eunuchs, which were
     made eunuchs by men: and there are eunuchs, which made themselves
     eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to
     receive it, let him receive it.

[Footnote a: Matthew expressly states that he went from Galilee through
Perea, and soon afterwards carries him forward to Jericho and Jerusalem.
(Comp. Mark also.) Yet he says that Jesus did this when he had finished
the parable of the unforgiving servant, which we have placed nearly six
months earlier (Sect. 92). Luke here presently agrees with Matthew and
Mark, and they go on together to the end, while heretofore Matthew and
Mark have given us nothing since Jesus went to the Feast of Tabernacles.
In one way or another we must suppose quite a break in their narrative.

                         |   early in the morning to hire labourers
                         | 2 into his vineyard. And when he had agreed
                         |   with the labourers for a [6]penny a day,
   3 he sent them into his vineyard. And he went out about the third
   4 hour, and saw others standing in the marketplace idle; and to them
     he said, Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I
   5 will give you. And they went their way. Again he went out about
   6 the sixth and the ninth hour, and did likewise. And about the
     eleventh _hour_ he went out, and found others standing; and he
   7 saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle? They say unto
     him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also
   8 into the vineyard. And when even was come, the lord of the
     vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the labourers, and pay them
   9 their hire, beginning from the last unto the first. And when they
     came that _were hired_ about the eleventh hour, they received
  10 every man a [6]penny. And when the first came, they supposed that
     they would receive more; and they likewise received every man a
  11 [6]penny. And when they received it, they murmured against the
  12 householder, saying, These last have spent _but_ one hour, and
     thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden of
  13 the day and the [7]scorching heat. But he answered and said to one
     of them, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me
  14 for a [6]penny? Take up that which is thine, and go thy way; it is
  15 my will to give unto this last, even as unto thee. Is it not
     lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? or is thine eye

     [Footnote 2: Or, _saved thee_.]

[Footnote a: Matthew mentions two blind men, while Mark and Luke describe
one, probably the more conspicuous one.--The discrepancy as to place, "as
he went out from Jericho," "as he drew nigh unto Jericho," is best
explained by the recent suggestion that the healing occurred after he
left the old Jericho, and as he was approaching the new Jericho which
Herod the Great had built at some distance away. An older, and also
possible explanation was that the blind men made application when he was
approaching the city, but were not then healed, and only when he had left
the city were they healed. (Comp. Matt. 15:23 ff., and Mark 8:22 f.)]




Sect. 127. JESUS VISITS ZACCHAEUS, AND SPEAKS THE PARABLE OF THE
POUNDS,[a] AND SETS OUT FOR JERUSALEM

Jericho


  Luke 19:1-28

  1, 2 And he entered and was passing through Jericho. And behold, a
     man called by name Zacchaeus; and he was a chief publican, and he
   3 was rich. And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for
   4 the crowd, because he was little of stature. And he ran on before,
     and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him: for he was to pass
   5 that way. And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and said
     unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to-day I must
   6 abide at thy house. And he made haste, and came down, and received
   7 him joyfully. And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, He
   8 is gone in to lodge with a man that is a sinner. And Zacchaeus
     stood, and said unto the Lord, Behold, Lord, the half of my goods
     I give to the poor; and if I have wrongfully exacted aught of any
   9 man, I restore fourfold [_see Ex. 22:1; Num. 5:6-7_]. And Jesus
     said unto him, To-day is salvation come to this house, forasmuch
  10 as he also is a son of Abraham. For the Son of man came to seek
     and to save that which was lost [_Ezek. 34:16_].
  11   And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable,
     because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and _because_ they supposed that
  12 the kingdom of God was immediately to appear. He said therefore, A
     certain nobleman went into a far country, to receive for himself a
  13 kingdom, and to return. And he called ten [1]servants of his, and
     gave them ten [2]pounds, and said unto them, Trade ye _herewith_
  14 till I come. But his citizens hated him, and sent an ambassage
  15 after him, saying, We will not that this man reign over us. And it
     came to pass, when he was come back again, having received the
     kingdom, that he commanded these [1]servants, unto whom he had
     given the money, to be called to him, that he might know what they
  16 had gained by trading. And the first came before him, saying,
  17 Lord, thy pound hath made ten pounds more. And he said unto him,
     Well done, thou good [3]servant: because thou wast found faithful
  18 in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities. And the
  19 second came, saying, Thy pound, Lord, hath made five pounds. And
  20 he said unto him also, Be thou also over five cities. And
     [4]another came, saying, Lord, behold, _here is_ thy pound, which
  21 I kept laid up in a napkin: for I feared thee, because thou art an
     austere man: thou takest up that thou layedst not down, and
  22 reapest that thou didst not sow. He saith unto him, Out of thine
     own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked [3]servant. Thou knewest
     that I am an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and
  23 reaping that I did not sow; then wherefore gavest thou not my
     money into the bank, and [5]I at my coming should have required it
  24 with interest? And he said unto them that stood by, Take away from
  25 him the pound, and give it unto him that hath the ten pounds. And
  26 they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds. I say unto you, that
     unto every one that hath shall be given; but from him that hath
  27 not, even that which he hath shall be taken away from him. Howbeit
     these mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them,
     bring hither, and slay them before me.
  28   And when he had thus spoken, he went on before, going up to
     Jerusalem.

     [Footnote 1: Gr. _bondservants_.]

[Footnote a: The similar parable of the Talents was given several days
later. See Sect. 139. On this first occasion the illustration has a
specific design (ver. 11 f.), which will not appear on the second,
_viz._, to check the wild enthusiasm of the multitude to make Jesus King
in Jerusalem as they had once planned a year ago (John 6:15. Sect. 73).]




PART XI

THE LAST PUBLIC MINISTRY IN JERUSALEM

_Friday before to Tuesday of Passion Week, Spring of A.D. 30 (or A.D.
29).[a] Just before Passover. Sects. 128a-138._

[Footnote a: If the feast of John 5:1 was a Passover, and so his ministry
lasted over three years, then his death was pretty certainly in A.D. 30;
otherwise in A.D. 29.]




Sect. 128a. JESUS ARRIVES AT BETHANY,[a] NEAR JERUSALEM

Friday afternoon


  John 11:55 to 12:1, 9-11

  55   Now the passover of the Jews was at hand: and many went up to
     Jerusalem out of the country before the passover, to purify
  56 themselves. They sought therefore for Jesus, and spake one with
     another, as they stood in the temple, What think ye? That he will
  57 not come to the feast? Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had
     given commandment, that, if any man knew where he was, he should
     shew it, that they might take him.
   1   Jesus therefore six days before the passover came to Bethany,
     where Lazarus was, whom Jesus raised from the dead.[b]
   9   The common people therefore of the Jews learned that he was
     there: and they came, not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might
  10 see Lazarus also, whom he raised from the dead. But the chief
  11 priests took counsel that they might put Lazarus also to death;
     because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and
     believed on Jesus.

[Footnote a: Compare former visits to this Bethany, Sects. 104, 118, and
see also below, Sect. 141.]

[Footnote b: John (12:2-8) gives the supper in the house of Simon the
leper at this stage, probably because it is the last mention of Bethany
in his Gospel. It seems better to follow the order of Mark here in the
location of the anointing of Jesus by Mary of Bethany.]




_In Sects. 128b-138 we have the Saviour's movements and teachings on
Sunday, Monday and Tuesday--the close of his public ministry, except the
little that he said during the Jewish and Roman trial. All of his
teaching thereafter will be given to his disciples._

Sect. 130. THE DESIRE OF SOME GREEKS TO SEE JESUS PUZZLES THE DISCIPLES
AND LEADS JESUS IN AGITATION OF SOUL TO INTERPRET LIFE AND DEATH AS
SACRIFICE AND TO SHOW HOW BY BEING "LIFTED UP" HE WILL DRAW ALL MEN TO
HIM

Jerusalem (_Monday_)


  John 12:20-50

  20   Now there were certain Greeks among those that went up to worship
  21 at the feast: these therefore came to Philip, which was of
     Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we would see
  22 Jesus. Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: Andrew cometh, and
  23 Philip, and they tell Jesus. And Jesus answereth them, saying, The
  24 hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified. Verily,
     verily, I say unto you, Except a grain of wheat fall into the
     earth and die, it abideth by itself alone; but if it die, it
  25 beareth much fruit. He that loveth his [1]life loseth it; and he
     that hateth his [1]life in this world shall keep it unto life
  26 eternal. If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am,
     there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will the
  27 Father honour. Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say [_see
     Ps. 42:6_]? Father, save me from this [2]hour. But for this cause
  28 came I unto this hour. Father, glorify thy name. There came
     therefore a voice out of heaven, _saying_, I have both glorified
  29 it, and will glorify it again. The multitude therefore, that stood
     by, and heard it, said that it had thundered: others said, An
  30 angel hath spoken to him. Jesus answered and said, This voice hath
  31 not come for my sake, but for your sakes. Now is [3]the judgement
  32 of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out. And
     I, if I be lifted up [4]from the earth, will draw all men unto
  33 myself. But this he said, signifying by what manner of death he
  34 should die. The multitude therefore answered him, We have heard
     out of the law that the Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest
     thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?
  35 Jesus therefore said unto them, Yet a little while is the light
     [5]among you. Walk while ye have the light, that darkness overtake
     you not: and he that walketh in the darkness knoweth not whither
  36 he goeth. While ye have the light, believe on the light, that ye
     may become sons of light.
       These things spake Jesus, and he departed and [6]hid himself from
  37 them. But though he had done so many signs before them, yet they
  38 believed not[a] on him: that the word of Isaiah the prophet might
     be fulfilled [_see Isa. 53:1_], which he spake,
       Lord, who hath believed our report?
       And to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?
  39 For this cause they could not believe, for that Isaiah said again,
  40   He hath blinded their eyes, and he hardened their heart;
       Lest they should see with their eyes, and perceive with their
         heart,
       And should turn,
       And I should heal them.
  41 These things said Isaiah [_see Isa. 6:1, 10_], because he saw his
  42 glory; and he spake of him. Nevertheless even of the rulers many
     believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess
  43 [7]it, lest they should be put out of the synagogue: for they
     loved the glory of men more than the glory of God.
  44   And Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not
  45 on me, but on him that sent me. And he that beholdeth me beholdeth
  46 him that sent me. I am come a light into the world, that whosoever
  47 believeth on me may not abide in the darkness. And if any man hear
     my sayings, and keep them not, I judge him not: for I came not to
  48 judge the world, but to save the world. He that rejecteth me, and
     receiveth not my sayings, hath one that judgeth him: the word that
  49 I spake, the same shall judge him in the last day. For I spake not
     from myself; but the Father which sent me, he hath given me a
  50 commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak. And I
     know that his commandment is life eternal: the things therefore
     which I speak, even as the Father hath said unto me, so I speak.

Sect. 132. THE RULERS (SANHEDRIN) FORMALLY CHALLENGE[a] THE AUTHORITY OF
JESUS AS AN ACCREDITED TEACHER (RABBI)

_Jesus bases His human authority on John the Baptist, His Forerunner who
baptized him, and demands the Sanhedrin's opinion of the Baptism of John.
This pertinent counter-question paralyzes the Jewish leaders and Jesus
drives His argument home by three parables. (a) Parable of the Two Sons.
(b) Parable of the Wicked Husbandmen. (c) Parable of the Marriage Feast
of the King's Son._

In the court of the Temple. (_Tuesday_[b]) A Day of Controversy

     and he came to the first, and said, [2]Son, go work to-day in the
  29 vineyard. And he answered and said, I will not: but afterward he
  30 repented himself, and went. And he came to the second, and said
     likewise. And he answered and said, I _go_, sir: and went not.
  31 Whether of the twain did the will of his father? They say, The
     first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, that the
     publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.
  32 For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed
     him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye,
     when ye saw it, did not even repent yourselves afterward, that ye

                         | 1   And Jesus answered|
   2 and spake again in parables unto them, saying, The kingdom of
     heaven is likened unto a certain king, which made a marriage
   3 feast for his son, and sent forth his [3]servants to call them
     that were bidden to the marriage feast: and they would not come.
   4 Again he sent forth other [3]servants, saying, Tell them that are
     bidden, Behold, I have made ready my dinner: my oxen and my
     fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come to the
   5 marriage feast. But they made light of it, and went their ways,
   6 one to his own farm, another to his merchandise: and the rest laid
     hold on his [3]servants, and entreated them shamefully, and killed
   7 them. But the king was wroth; and he sent his armies, and
   8 destroyed those murderers, and burned their city. Then saith he to
     his [3]servants, The wedding is ready, but they that were bidden
   9 were not worthy. Go ye therefore unto the partings of the
     highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage feast.
  10 And those [3]servants went out into the highways, and gathered
     together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the
  11 wedding was filled with guests. But when the king came in to
     behold the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a
  12 wedding-garment: and he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in
  13 hither not having a wedding-garment? And he was speechless. Then
     the king said to the [6]servants, Bind him hand and foot, and cast
     him out into the outer darkness; there shall be the weeping and
  14 gnashing of teeth. For many are called, but few chosen.

[Footnote a: It was very common to test a Rabbi with hard questions. See
this continued in the following sections. In like manner the Fourth
Gospel gave us much animated dialogue between Jesus and the Jews at
Jerusalem in chap. 5, and chap. 7-10. The Sanhedrin were within their
rights in challenging the ecclesiastical and scholastic (scribal)
standing of Jesus. He did not dodge in his answer.]

[Footnote b: On this last day of Christ's public ministry the Sanhedrin
seek to break the power of Jesus with the people whose hero he is since
the Triumphal Entry. The first attempt fails miserably, but it is
followed by a series of other efforts to entrap Jesus and so turn the
crowd against him. The three parables leave the rulers exposed by Jesus
and they keenly feel the denunciation of the reply of Jesus.]




Sect. 133. THE PHARISEES AND THE HERODIANS TRY TO ENSNARE JESUS ABOUT
PAYING TRIBUTE TO CAESAR


  Mark 12:13-17          |Matt. 22:15-22         |Luke 20:20-26

                         |                       |   feigned themselves

     were come, they say |   the Herodians,      |   they asked him,
     unto him, [1]Master,|   saying, [1]Master,  |   saying, [1]Master,

  15 Shall we give, or   |   tribute unto Caesar,|   give tribute unto

     But he, knowing     |   perceived their     |   he perceived their
     their hypocrisy,    |   wickedness, and     |   craftiness, and
     said unto them, Why |   said, Why tempt ye  |   said unto them,

     [Footnote 2: See marginal note on Matt. 18:28.]

[Footnote a: The Pharisees send a group of their keenest students to go
with the Herodians to catch Jesus with the dilemma about paying tribute
to Caesar, a live question in current politics and theology. They offered
Jesus the alternative of popular disfavor or of disloyalty to the Roman
government.]

     had answered them well, asked  |35 themselves together. And one of
     him,                           |   them, a lawyer, asked him a
                                    |   question, tempting him,

     first of all [_see Deut. 6:4_]?|37 commandment in the law? And he

     is this, Thou shalt love thy   |   like _unto it_ is this, Thou
     neighbor as thyself [_see Lev. |   shalt love thy neighbour as
     19:18_]. There is none other   |40 thyself. On these two

  32 And the scribe said unto him,  |   law, and the prophets.
     Of a truth, [1]Master, thou    |
  33 hast well said that he is one; and there is none other but he: and
     to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding,
     and with all the strength, and to love his neighbor as himself, is
     much more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices [_see 1
  34 Sam. 15:22_]. And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he
     said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no

  12 among you shall be your [4]servant. And whosoever shall exalt

     be exalted.

  15   Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass
     sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he is become so, ye
     make him twofold more a son of [7]hell than yourselves.
  16   Woe unto you, ye blind guides, which say, Whosoever shall swear
     by the [8]temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the
  17 gold of the [8]temple, he is [9]a debtor. Ye fools and blind: for
     whether is greater, the gold, or the [8]temple that hath
  18 sanctified the gold? And, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it
     is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gift that is upon it,
  19 he is [9]a debtor. Ye blind: for whether is greater, the gift, or
  20 the altar that sanctifieth the gift? He therefore that sweareth by
  21 the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things thereon. And he that
     sweareth by the [8]temple, sweareth by it, and by him that
  22 dwelleth therein. And he that sweareth by the heaven, sweareth by
     the throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon.
  23   Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye tithe
     mint and [10]anise and cummin [_see Lev. 27:30; Mic. 6:8_], and
     have left undone the weightier matters of the law, judgement, and
     mercy, and faith: but these ye ought to have done, and not to have
  24 left the other undone. Ye blind guides, which strain out the gnat,
     and swallow the camel.
  25   Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye cleanse
     the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are
  26 full from extortion and excess. Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first
     the inside of the cup and of the platter, that the outside thereof
     may become clean also.
  27   Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like
     unto whited sepulchres, which outwardly appear beautiful, but
     inwardly are full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness.
  28 Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but inwardly
     ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.
  29   Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye build the
     sepulchres of the prophets, and garnish the tombs of the
  30 righteous, and say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we
     should not have been partakers with them in the blood of the
  31 prophets. Wherefore ye witness to yourselves, that ye are sons of
  32 them that slew the prophets. Fill ye up then the measure of your
  33 fathers. Ye serpents, ye offspring of vipers, how shall ye escape
  34 the judgement of [7]hell? Therefore, behold, I send unto you
     prophets, and wise men, and scribes: some of them shall ye kill
     and crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues,
  35 and persecute from city to city: that upon you may come all the
     righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of Abel the
     righteous unto the blood of Zachariah son of Barachiah, whom ye
     slew between the sanctuary and the altar [_see Gen. 4:8; 2 Chron.
  36 24:20-21_]. Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come
     upon this generation.
  37   O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killeth the prophets, and stoneth
     them that are sent unto her! how often would I have gathered thy
     children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her
  38 wings, and ye would not! Behold, your house is left unto you
  39 [11]desolate [_see Jer. 12:7; 22:5_]. For I say unto you, Ye shall
     not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed _is_ he that
     cometh in the name of the Lord [_see Ps. 118:26_].

Sect. 138. JESUS CLOSELY OBSERVES[a] THE CONTRIBUTIONS IN THE TEMPLE, AND
COMMENDS THE POOR WIDOW'S GIFT

     into the treasury: and many    |   the rich men that were casting
     that were rich cast in much.   |   their gifts into the treasury.
  42 And there came [2]a poor widow,| 2 And he saw a certain poor widow
     and she cast in two mites,     |   casting in thither two mites.
  43 which make a farthing. And he  |
     called unto him his disciples, |
     and said unto them, Verily I   | 3 And he said, Of a truth I say

[Footnote a: Notice that this was the last occurrence in the Saviour's
public ministry, except the trial and the crucifixion. This is the last
appearance of Jesus in the Temple. His public teaching is over save the
words of defence in his trial and the seven sayings on the Cross. The
Pharisees and Sadducees had withdrawn in terror at the explosion of the
wrath of Jesus and even the disciples were at some distance as Jesus sat
alone by the treasury. It is useless further to plead with his enemies.
The task now remains to get the disciples prepared for the Master's death
and the time is short and they as yet have completely failed to grasp the
fact or the significance of his death and the promise of his resurrection
on the third day.]

Sect. 139. SITTING ON THE MOUNT OF OLIVES, JESUS SPEAKS TO HIS DISCIPLES
ABOUT THE DESTRUCTION OF JERUSALEM, AND HIS OWN SECOND COMING, IN
APOCALYPTIC LANGUAGE. THE GREAT ESCHATOLOGICAL DISCOURSE[a]

(_Tuesday Afternoon_)


[Footnote a: This great discourse has as its background the death of
Christ. Further on as part punishment for this crime lies the destruction
of Jerusalem. This catastrophe is itself a symbol of the end of the world
and in one sense a coming of Christ in power and judgment. But Christ
boldly predicts his own personal return to earth, though the time is not
revealed. But he does exhort an expectant attitude toward the promises of
his coming and readiness for his return which will be at an unexpected
hour. Jesus employs the common Jewish apocalyptic imagery to portray this
most difficult subject. Some scholars insist that Jesus was himself
merely a wild enthusiast who was carried away by the Messianic hopes of
his people, but that is a one-sided and distorted view of Christ's life
and ignores the great mass of his ethical teaching. It forgets also that
Jesus has a world program of conquest and of power. The various aspects
of the discourse are not kept distinct. Some think that the Gospels have
misunderstood or misrepresented Jesus in this discourse. But we can catch
the general drift of the teaching and leave alone minute details of time
and place against which Jesus himself warned us.]

               | 3 foolish, and five were wise. For the foolish, when
               | 4 they took their [1]lamps, took no oil with them: but
               |   the wise took oil in their vessels with their
               | 5 [1]lamps. Now while the bridegroom tarried, they all
               | 6 slumbered and slept. But at midnight there is a cry,
               |   Behold, the bridegroom! Come ye forth to meet him.
               | 7 Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their
               | 8 [1]lamps. And the foolish said unto the wise, Give
               | 9 us of your oil; for our [1]lamps are going out. But
               |   the wise answered, saying, Peradventure there will
               |   not be enough for us and you: go ye rather to them
               |10 that sell, and buy for yourselves. And while they
               |   went away to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that
               |   were ready went in with him to the marriage feast:
               |11 and the door was shut. Afterward, come also the
               |12 other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. But
               |   he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know
               |13 you not. Watch therefore, for ye know not the day
               |   nor the hour.
  _Parable of  |14   For _it is_ as _when_ a man, going into another
  the Talents._|   country, called his own [2]servants, and delivered
               |15 unto them his goods. And unto one he gave five
               |   talents, to another two, to another one; to each
               |   according to his several ability; and he went on his
               |16 journey. Straightway he that received the five
               |   talents went and traded with them, and made other
               |17 five talents. In like manner he also that _received_
               |18 the two gained other two. But he that received the
               |   one went away and digged in the earth, and hid his
               |19 lord's money. Now after a long time the lord of
               |   those [2]servants cometh, and maketh a reckoning with
               |20 them. And he that received the five talents came and
               |   brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou
               |   deliveredst unto me five talents: lo, I have gained
               |21 other five talents. His lord said unto him, Well
               |   done, good and faithful [3]servant: thou hast been
               |   faithful over a few things, I will set thee over
               |   many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
               |22 And he also that _received_ the two talents came and
               |   said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents:
               |23 lo, I have gained other two talents. His lord said
               |   unto him, Well done, good and faithful [3]servant;
               |   thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will
               |   set thee over many things: enter thou into the joy
               |24 of thy lord. And he also that had received the one
               |   talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou
               |   art a hard man, reaping where thou didst not sow,
               |25 and gathering where thou didst not scatter: and I
               |   was afraid, and went away and hid thy talent in the
               |26 earth: lo, thou hast thine own. But his lord
               |   answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful
               |   [3]servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed
               |27 not, and gather where I did not scatter; thou
               |   oughtest therefore to have put my money to the
               |   bankers, and at my coming I should have received
               |28 back mine own with interest. Take ye away therefore
               |   the talent from him, and give it unto him that hath
               |29 the ten talents. For unto every one that hath shall
               |   be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him
               |   that hath not, even that which he hath shall be
               |30 taken away. And cast ye out the unprofitable
               |   [3]servant into the outer darkness: there shall be
               |   the weeping and gnashing of teeth.
  _6  Picture  |31   But when the Son of man shall come in his glory,
  of the       |   and all the angels with him [_see Zech. 14:5_], then
  Judgment     |32 shall he sit on the throne of his glory: and before
  with Parable |   him shall be gathered all the nations: and he shall

               |   the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of
               |35 the world: for I was an hungred, and ye gave me
               |   meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a
               |36 stranger, and ye took me in; naked, and ye clothed
               |   me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison,
               |37 and ye came unto me. Then shall the righteous answer
               |   him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and
               |38 fed thee? or athirst, and gave thee drink? And when
               |   saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked,
               |39 and clothed thee? And when saw we thee sick, or in
               |40 prison, and came unto thee? And the King shall
               |   answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you,
               |   Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of these my brethren,
               |41 _even_ these least, ye did it unto me. Then shall he
               |   say also unto them on the left hand, [5]Depart from
               |   me, ye cursed, into the eternal fire which is
               |42 prepared for the devil and his angels: for I was an
               |   hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and
               |43 ye gave me no drink: I was a stranger, and ye took
               |   me not in; naked, and ye clothed me not; sick, and

Sect. 141. AT THE FEAST IN THE HOUSE OF SIMON THE LEPER MARY OF BETHANY
ANOINTS JESUS FOR HIS BURIAL

At Bethany (Tuesday evening, Jewish Wednesday)


  Mark 14:3-9            |Matt. 26:6-13          |John 12:2-8

[Footnote a: This anointing has nothing in common with that given by Luke
(Sect. 59), except the fact of a woman anointing the Saviour's feet, and
the name Simon, which was common. The former was in Galilee, this is at
Bethany near Jerusalem. There the host despised the woman who anointed,
here her brother is one of the guests, and her sister an active
attendant. There the woman was "a sinner," a notoriously bad woman, here
it is the devout Mary who "sat at the Lord's feet and heard his word"
months before (Sect. 104). There the host thought strange that Jesus
allowed her to touch him, here the disciples complain of the waste. There
the Saviour gave assurance of forgiveness, here of perpetual and
world-wide honor. Especially notice that here the woman who anoints is
anticipating his speedy death and burial, of which at the former time he
had never distinctly spoken. In view of all these differences it is
absurd to represent the two anointings as the same, and outrageous on
such slender ground to cast reproach on Mary of Bethany.]

Sect. 144. JESUS PARTAKES OF THE PASCHAL MEAL WITH THE TWELVE APOSTLES
AND REBUKES THEIR JEALOUSY

Jerusalem, Thursday evening after sunset (beginning of Jewish Friday)


  Mark 14:17             |Matt. 26:20            |Luke 22:14-16, 24-30
                         |                       |
  17   And when it was   |20   Now when even was |14   And when the hour
     evening he cometh   |   come, he was sitting|   was come, he sat
     with the twelve.    |   at meat with the    |   down, and the
                         |   twelve [1]disciples;|   apostles with him.
                         |                       |15 And he said unto
                         |                       |   them, With desire
     I have desired to eat this passover[a] with you before I suffer:
  16 for I say unto you, I will not eat it, until it be fulfilled in
     the kingdom of God.
  24   And there arose also a contention among them, which of them is
  25 accounted to be [2]greatest. And he said unto them, The kings of
     the Gentiles have lordship over them; and they that have authority
  26 over them are called Benefactors. But ye _shall_ not _be_ so: but
     he that is the greater among you, let him become as the younger;
  27 and he that is chief, as he that doth serve. For whether is
     greater, he that [3]sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? is not he
     that [3]sitteth at meat? but I am in the midst of you as he that
  28 serveth. But ye are they which have continued with me in my
  29 temptations; and [4]I appoint unto you a kingdom, even as my
  30 Father appointed unto me, that ye may eat and drink at my table in
     my kingdom; and ye shall sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes
     of Israel.

[Footnote a: Some regard certain expressions in the Gospel of John as
showing that Jesus did not eat the Paschal meal, thus hopelessly
contradicting the other Gospels. But no one of John's expressions shows
what is supposed, and one of them really indicates the contrary. See note
at end of volume. Matthew, Mark, and Luke clearly show that he did eat
the regular Passover meal.]

DISCIPLES

Evening before the Crucifixion (our Thursday, Jewish Friday)


  John 13:1-20

   1   Now before[a] the feast of the passover, Jesus knowing that his
     hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the
     Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved
   2 them [1]unto the end. And during supper, the devil having already
     put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's _son_, to betray
   3 him, _Jesus_, knowing that the Father had given all things into
     his hands, and that he came forth from God, and goeth unto God,
   4 riseth from supper, and layeth aside his garments; and he took a
   5 towel, and girded himself. Then he poureth water into the bason,
     and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the
   6 towel wherewith he was girded. So he cometh to Simon Peter. He
   7 saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet? Jesus answered and
     said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt
   8 understand hereafter. Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash
     my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part
   9 with me. Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but
  10 also my hands and my head. Jesus saith to him, He that is bathed
     needeth not [2]save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and
  11 ye are clean, but not all. For he knew him that should betray him;
     therefore said he, Ye are not all clean.
  12   So when he had washed their feet, and taken his garments, and
     [3]sat down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to
  13 you? Ye call me, [4]Master, and, Lord: and ye say well; for so I
  14 am. If I then, the Lord and the [4]Master, have washed your feet,
  15 ye also ought to wash one another's feet. For I have given you an
  16 example, that ye also should do as I have done to you. Verily,
     verily, I say unto you, A [5]servant is not greater than his lord;
  17 neither [6]one that is sent greater than he that sent him. If ye
  18 know these things, blessed are ye if ye do them. I speak not of
     you all: I know whom I [7]have chosen: but that the scripture may
     be fulfilled, He that eateth [8]my bread lifted up his heel
  19 against me [_see Ps. 41:9_]. From henceforth I tell you before it
     come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that
  20 [9]I am _he_. Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth
     whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth
     him that sent me.

                  |                |                |   table reclining
                  |                |   in Jesus' bosom one of his
                  |                |   disciples, whom Jesus loved.
                  |                |24 Simon Peter therefore beckoneth
                  |                |   to him, and saith unto him, Tell
                  |                |   _us_ who it is of whom he
                  |                |25 speaketh. He leaning back, as he
                  |                |   was, on Jesus' breast saith unto
                  |                |26 him, Lord, who is it? Jesus
                  |                |   therefore answereth, He it is,
                  |                |   for whom I shall dip the sop, and
                  |                |   give it him. So when he had
                  |                |   dipped the sop, he taketh and
                  |                |   giveth it to Judas, _the son_ of
                  |                |   Simon Iscariot.
                  |25 And Judas,   |
                  |   which        |
                  |   betrayed him,|
                  |   answered and |
                  |   said, Is it  |
                  |   I, Rabbi? He |
                  |   saith unto   |
                  |   him, Thou    |
                  |   hast said.   |
                  |                |27                 And after the
     sop, then entered Satan into him. Jesus therefore saith unto him,
  28 That thou doest, do quickly. Now no man at the table knew for what
  29 intent he spake this unto him. For some thought, because Judas
     had the [3]bag, that Jesus said unto him, Buy what things we have
     need of for the feast; or, that he should give something to the
  30 poor. He then having received the sop went out straightway: and it
     was night.

Sect. 147. AFTER THE DEPARTURE OF JUDAS JESUS WARNS THE DISCIPLES (PETER
IN PARTICULAR) AGAINST DESERTION, WHILE ALL PROTEST THEIR LOYALTY


  Mark 14:27-31   |Matt. 26:31-35  |Luke 22:31-38   |John 13:31-38

                  |                |                |31   When therefore
     he was gone out, Jesus saith, Now [1]is the Son of man glorified,
  32 and God [1]is glorified in him; and God shall glorify him in
  33 himself, and straightway shall he glorify him. Little children,
     yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said
  34 unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say unto
     you, A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another;
  35 [2]even as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. By
                  |                |                |   this shall all
                  |                |                |   men know that
                  |                |                |   ye are my
                  |                |                |   disciples, if
                  |                |                |   ye have love
                  |                |                |   one to another.
  27   And Jesus  |31   Then saith |31   Simon,     |36   Simon Peter
     saith unto   |   Jesus unto   |   Simon,       |   saith unto him,
     them, All ye |   them, All ye |   behold, Satan|   Lord, whither
     shall be     |   shall be     |   [4]asked to  |   goest thou?

                  |                |35   And he said unto them, When I
                  |                |   sent you forth without purse,
                  |                |   and wallet, and shoes, lacked ye

                  |                |36 Nothing. And he said unto them,
                  |                |   But now, he that hath a purse,
                  |                |   let him take it, and likewise a
                  |                |   wallet: [5]and he that hath
                  |                |   none, let him sell his cloke,
                  |                |37 and buy a sword. For I say unto
                  |                |   you, that this which is written
                  |                |   must be fulfilled in me [_see
                  |                |   Isa. 53:12_], And he was
                  |                |   reckoned with transgressors: for
                  |                |   that which concerneth me hath
                  |                |38 [6]fulfilment. And they said,
                  |                |   Lord, behold, here are two
                  |                |   swords. And he said unto them,

Sect. 149. THE FAREWELL DISCOURSE TO HIS DISCIPLES IN THE UPPER ROOM

Jerusalem


  John 14[a]

   1   Let not your heart be troubled: [1]ye believe in God, believe
   2 also in me. In my Father's house are many [2]mansions; if it were
     not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you.
   3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I come again, and will
     receive you unto myself; that where I am, _there_ ye may be also.
   4 [3]And whither I go, ye know the way. Thomas saith unto him, Lord,
   5 we know not whither thou goest; how know we the way? Jesus saith
   6 unto him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no one cometh
   7 unto the Father, but [4]by me. If ye had known me, ye would have
     known my Father also: from henceforth ye know him, and have seen
   8 him. Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it
   9 sufficeth us. Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with
     you, and dost thou not know me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath
  10 seen the Father; how sayest thou, Shew us the Father? Believest
     thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words
     that I say unto you I speak not from myself: but the Father
  11 abiding in me doeth his works. Believe me that I am in the Father,
     and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works' sake.
  12 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works
     that I do shall he do also; and greater _works_ than these shall
  13 he do; because I go unto the Father. And whatsoever ye shall ask
     in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in
  14 the Son. If ye shall ask [5]me anything in my name, that will I
  15 do. If ye love me, ye will keep my commandments. And I will
  16 [6]pray the Father, and he shall give you another [7]Comforter,
  17 that he may be with you for ever, _even_ the Spirit of truth: whom
     the world cannot receive; for it beholdeth him not, neither
     knoweth him: ye know him; for he abideth with you, and shall be in
  18 you. I will not leave you [8]desolate: I come unto you. Yet a
  19 little while, and the world beholdeth me no more; but ye behold
  20 me: because I live, [9]ye shall live also. In that day ye shall
  21 know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you. He that
     hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me:
     and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love
  22 him, and will manifest myself unto him. Judas (not Iscariot) saith
     unto him, Lord, what is come to pass that thou wilt manifest
  23 thyself unto us, and not unto the world? Jesus answered and
     said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my word: and my
     Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our
  24 abode with him. He that loveth me not keepeth not my words: and
     the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's who sent me.
  25   These things have I spoken unto you, while _yet_ abiding with
  26 you. But the [7]Comforter, _even_ the Holy Spirit, whom the Father
     will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring to
  27 your remembrance all that I said unto you. Peace I leave with you;
     my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you.
  28 Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be fearful. Ye
     heard how I said to you, I go away, and I come unto you. If ye
     loved me, ye would have rejoiced, because I go unto the Father:
  29 for the Father is greater than I. And now I have told you before
  30 it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe. I
     will no more speak much with you, for the prince of the world
  31 cometh: and he hath nothing in me; but that the world may know
     that I love the Father, and as the Father gave me commandment,
     even so I do. Arise, let us go hence.[b]

[Footnote a: Chapters 13 to 17 in John really belong together. There is
first the effort of Jesus to stop the bickerings of the Twelve, then his
warning and their reply. Jesus continues to address them with repeated
interruption (dialogue), but finally they fear to ask him further
(monologue). The discourse concludes with the wonderful prayer (the real
Lord's Prayer) in chapter 17.]

Sect. 150. THE DISCOURSE ON THE WAY TO GETHSEMANE

Possibly on the Street


  John 15 and 16[a]

   1   I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. Every branch
   2 in me that beareth not fruit, he taketh it away: and every
     _branch_ that beareth fruit, he cleanseth it, that it may bear
   3 more fruit. Already ye are clean because of the word which I have
   4 spoken unto you. Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot
     bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; so neither can
   5 ye, except ye abide in me. I am the vine, ye are the branches: He
     that abideth in me, and I in him, the same beareth much fruit: for
   6 apart from me ye can do nothing. If a man abide not in me, he is
     cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and they gather them, and
   7 cast them into the fire, and they are burned. If ye abide in me,
     and my words abide in you, ask whatsoever ye will, and it shall be
   8 done unto you. Herein [1]is my Father glorified, [2]that ye bear
   9 much fruit; and _so_ shall ye be my disciples. Even as the Father
  10 hath loved me, I also have loved you: abide ye in my love. If ye
     keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have
  11 kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love. These things
     have I spoken unto you, that my joy may be in you, and _that_ your
  12 joy may be fulfilled. This is my commandment, that ye love one
  13 another, even as I have loved you. Greater love hath no man than
  14 this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. Ye are my
  15 friends, if ye do the things which I command you. No longer do I
     call you [3]servants; for the [4]servant knoweth not what his lord
     doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I heard
  16 from my Father I have made known unto you. Ye did not choose me,
     but I chose you, and appointed you, that ye should go and bear
     fruit, and _that_ your fruit should abide: that whatsoever ye
  17 shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you. These
  18 things I command you, that ye may love one another. If the world
     hateth you, [5]ye know that it hath hated me before _it hated_
  19 you. If ye were of the world, the world would love its own: but
     because ye are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world,
  20 therefore the world hateth you. Remember the word that I said unto
     you, A [4]servant is not greater than his lord. If they persecuted
     me, they will also persecute you; if they keep my word, they will
  21 keep yours also. But all these things will they do unto you for my
  22 name's sake, because they know not him that sent me. If I had not
     come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have
  23 no excuse for their sin. He that hateth me hateth my Father also.
  24 If I had not done among them the works which none other did, they
     had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and
  25 my Father. But _this cometh to pass_, that the word may be
     fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a
  26 cause [_see Ps. 35:19; 69:4_]. But when the [6]Comforter is come,
     whom I will send unto you from the Father, _even_ the Spirit of
     truth, which [7]proceedeth from the Father, he shall bear witness
  27 of me: [8]and ye also bear witness, because ye have been with me
     from the beginning.

   1   These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be made
   2 to stumble. They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the hour
     cometh, that whosoever killeth you shall think that he offereth
   3 service unto God. And these things will they do, because they have
   4 not known the Father, nor me. But these things have I spoken unto
     you, that when their hour is come, ye may remember them, how that
     I told you. And these things I said not unto you from the
   5 beginning, because I was with you. But now I go unto him that sent
   6 me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou? But because I
     have spoken these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart.
   7 Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I
     go away: for if I go not away, the [6]Comforter will not come unto
   8 you; but if I go, I will send him unto you. And he, when he is
     come, will convict the world in respect of sin, and of
   9 righteousness, and of judgement: of sin, because they believe not
  10 on me; of righteousness, because I go to the Father, and ye behold
  11 me no more; of judgement, because the prince of this world hath
  12 been judged. I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot
  13 bear them now. Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he
     shall guide you into all the truth: for he shall not speak from
     himself; but what things soever he shall hear, _these_ shall he
     speak: and he shall declare unto you the things that are to come.
  14 He shall glorify me: for he shall take of mine, and shall declare
  15 _it_ unto you. All things whatsoever the Father hath are mine:
     therefore said I, that he taketh of mine, and shall declare _it_
  16 unto you. A little while, and ye behold me no more; and again a
  17 little while, and ye shall see me. _Some_ of his disciples
     therefore said one to another, What is this that he saith unto us,
     A little while, and ye behold me not; and again a little while,
  18 and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father? They said
     therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? We know not
  19 what he saith. Jesus perceived that they were desirous to ask him,
     and he said unto them, Do ye inquire among yourselves concerning
     this, that I said, A little while, and ye behold me not, and again
  20 a little while, and ye shall see me? Verily, verily, I say unto
     you, that ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice:
  21 ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy. A
     woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come:
     but when she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more
  22 the anguish, for the joy that a man is born into the world. And ye
     therefore now have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your
     heart shall rejoice, and your joy no one taketh away from you
  23 [_see Isa. 66:14_]. And in that day ye shall [9]ask me nothing.
     Verily, verily, I say unto you, If ye shall ask anything of the
  24 Father, he will give it you in my name. Hitherto have ye asked
     nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be
     fulfilled.
  25   These things have I spoken unto you in [10]proverbs: the hour
     cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in [10]proverbs, but
  26 shall tell you plainly of the Father. In that day ye shall ask in
     my name: and I say not unto you, that I will [11]pray the Father
  27 for you; for the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved
  28 me, and have believed that I came forth from the Father. I came
     out from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave
  29 the world, and go unto the Father. His disciples say, Lo, now
  30 speakest thou plainly, and speakest no [12]proverb. Now know we
     that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should
     ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God.
  31 Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe? Behold, the hour cometh,
  32 yea, is come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own,
     and shall leave me alone: and _yet_ I am not alone, because the
  33 Father is with me. These things have I spoken unto you, that in me
     ye may have peace. In the world ye have tribulation: but be of
     good cheer; I have overcome the world.

Sect. 151. CHRIST'S INTERCESSORY PRAYER

Possibly near Gethsemane


  John 17

   1   These things spake Jesus; and lifting up his eyes to heaven, he
     said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that the Son may
   2 glorify thee: even as thou gavest him authority over all flesh,
     that whatsoever thou hast given him, to them he should give
   3 eternal life. And this is life eternal, that they should know thee
     the only true God, and him whom thou didst send, _even_ Jesus
   4 Christ. I glorified thee on the earth, having accomplished the
   5 work which thou hast given me to do. And now, O Father, glorify
     thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee
   6 before the world was. I manifested thy name unto the men whom thou
     gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them
   7 to me; and they have kept thy word. Now they know that all things
   8 whatsoever thou hast given me are from thee: for the words which
     thou gavest me I have given unto them; and they received _them_,
     and knew of a truth that I came forth from thee, and they believed
   9 that thou didst send me. I [1]pray for them: I [1]pray not for the
     world, but for those whom thou hast given me; for they are thine:
  10 and all things that are mine are thine, and thine are mine: and I
  11 am glorified in them. And I am no more in the world, and these are
     in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep them in thy
     name which thou hast given me, that they may be one, even as we
  12 _are_. While I was with them, I kept them in thy name which thou
     hast given me: and I guarded them, and not one of them perished,
     but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled
  13 [_see Ps. 41:9_]. But now I come to thee; and these things I speak
  14 in the world, that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves. I
     have given them thy word; and the world hated them, because they
  15 are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. I [1]pray not
     that thou shouldest take them [2]from the world, but that thou
  16 shouldest keep them [2]from [3]the evil _one_. They are not of the
  17 world, even as I am not of the world. [4]Sanctify them in the
  18 truth: thy word is truth. As thou didst send me into the world,
  19 even so sent I them into the world. And for their sakes I
     [4]sanctify myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified in
  20 truth. Neither for these only do I [1]pray, but for them also that
  21 believe on me through their word; that they may all be one; even
     as thou, Father, _art_ in me, and I in thee, that they also may be
  22 in us: that the world may believe that thou didst send me. And the
     glory which thou hast given me I have given unto them; that they
  23 may be one, even as we _are_ one; I in them, and thou in me, that
     they may be perfected into one; that the world may know that thou
  24 didst send me, and lovedst them, even as thou lovedst me. Father,
     [5]that which thou hast given me, I will that, where I am, they
     also may be with me; that they may behold my glory, which thou
     hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the
  25 world. O righteous Father, the world knew thee not, but I knew

     if it were    |                 |   prayed,       |
     possible, the |                 |   saying,       |

     pass away from|                 |                 |
  36 him. And he   |                 |                 |
     said, Abba,   |   saying, O my  |                 |
     Father, all   |   Father, if it |42 Father, if    |
     things are    |   be possible,  |   thou be       |
     possible unto |   let this cup  |   willing,      |
     thee; remove  |   pass away from|   remove this   |
     this cup from |   me:           |   cup from me:  |
     me: howbeit   |   nevertheless, |   nevertheless  |
     not what I    |   not as I will,|   not my will,  |
     will, but what|   but as thou   |   but thine, be |
     thou wilt.    |   wilt.         |43 done. [3]And there appeared
                   |                 |   unto him an angel from heaven,
                   |                 |44 strengthening him. And being
                   |                 |   in an agony he prayed more
                   |                 |   earnestly: and his sweat
                   |                 |   became as it were great drops
                   |                 |   of blood falling down upon the
                   |                 |45 ground. And when he rose up
                   |                 |   from his prayer, he came unto
  37 And he cometh,|40 And he cometh |   the disciples, and found them
     and findeth   |   unto the      |46 sleeping for sorrow, and said
     them sleeping,|   disciples, and|   unto them, Why sleep ye? rise
     and saith unto|   findeth them  |   and pray, that ye enter not
     Peter, Simon, |   sleeping, and |   into temptation.
     sleepest thou?|   saith unto    |
     couldest thou |   Peter, What,  |
     not watch one |   could ye not watch with me|
  38 hour? [2]Watch|41 one hour? [2]Watch and    |
     and pray, that ye   |   pray, that ye enter |
     enter not into      |   not into temptation:|
     temptation: the     |   the spirit indeed is|
     spirit indeed is    |   willing, but the    |
     willing, but the    |42 flesh is weak. Again|
  39 flesh is weak. And  |   a second time he    |
     again he went away, |   went away, and      |
     and prayed, saying  |   prayed, saying, O my|
     the same words.     |   Father, if this     |
                         |   cannot pass away,   |
                         |   except I drink it,  |
                         |   thy will be done.   |
  40 And again he came,  |43 And he came again   |
     and found them      |   and found them      |
     sleeping, for their |   sleeping, for their |
     eyes were very      |44 eyes were heavy. And|
     heavy; and they wist|   he left them again, |
     not what to answer  |   and went away, and  |
     him.                |   prayed a third time,|
                         |   saying again the    |
                         |   same words.         |
  41 And he cometh the   |45             Then    |
     third time, and     |   cometh he to the    |
     saith unto them,    |   disciples, and saith|
     Sleep on now, and   |   unto them, Sleep on |
     take your rest: it  |   now, and take your  |
     is enough; the hour |   rest: behold, the   |
     is come; behold, the|   hour is at hand, and|
     Son of man is       |   the Son of man is   |
     betrayed into the   |   betrayed unto the   |
     hands of sinners.   |   hands of sinners.   |
  42 Arise, let us be    |46 Arise, let us be    |
     going: behold, he   |   going: behold, he is|
     that betrayeth me is|   at hand that        |
     at hand.            |   betrayeth me.       |

[Footnote a: The Synoptic Gospels do not give the great discourse of
Jesus in John 14 to 17. Hence they represent Jesus as going forth to
Gethsemane after the institution of the supper (Sect. 148). The time was
probably not long and they apparently sang the hymn (probably one of the
Psalms) as they rose to leave the Upper Room (John 14:31). Hence the
passage in John 15 to 17 comes in between singing the hymn and reaching
Gethsemane.]

     Judas, one   |   twelve, came,|   and he that  |   for Jesus

                  |                | 4 torches and weapons. Jesus
                  |                |   therefore, knowing all the

                  |                | 5 them, Whom seek ye? They
                  |                |   answered him, Jesus of Nazareth.
                  |                |   Jesus saith unto them, I am

Sect. 154. JESUS FIRST[a] EXAMINED BY ANNAS, THE EX-HIGH-PRIEST

_The Jewish Trial and related occurrences, Sects. 154-162._

Friday before dawn


  John 18:12-14, 19-23

  12   So the [1]band and the [2]chief captain, and the officers of the
  13 Jews, seized Jesus and bound him, and led him to Annas first; for
     he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was high priest that year.
  14 Now Caiaphas was he which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was
     expedient that one man should die for the people.
  19   The high priest therefore asked Jesus of his disciples, and of
  20 his teaching. Jesus answered him, I have spoken openly to the
     world; I ever taught in [3]synagogues, and in the temple, where all
  21 the Jews come together; and in secret spake I nothing. Why askest
     thou me? ask them that have heard _me_, what I spake unto them:
  22 behold, these know the things which I said. And when he had said
     this, one of the officers standing by struck Jesus [4]with his
  23 hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so? Jesus answered
     him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well,
     why smitest thou me?

[Footnote a: The _Jewish trial_ comprised three stages, the preliminary
examination by Annas (Sect. 154), the informal trial by the Sanhedrin,
probably before dawn, and the formal trial after dawn. With these are
narrated two related matters, the denial by Peter and the suicide of
Judas.]

[Footnote a: Each of the four Gospels records three denials; but the
details differ considerably, as must always be the case where in each
narrative a few facts are selected out of many sayings and doings. We
have seen (footnote on Sect. 154) that there were _three stages_ of the
Jewish trial, (l) before Annas, (2) before Caiaphas and the Sanhedrin for
informal examination, (3) before them in a formal trial. Now John gives
only the first of the three stages, Luke only the last, Matthew and Mark
give the second stage fully, and the third in brief mention. If Peter's
denials ran through all three (and Luke says in ver. 59 that there was an
hour between his second and third denials), then no one of the four
Gospels could give each of the denials precisely at the time of its
occurrence; and so each Gospel merely throws them together, as in another
way we here bring them together in one section. There is no difficulty
about the substantial fact of the denials; and we must be content with
our inability to arrange all the circumstances into a complete
programme.]




Sect. 157. AFTER DAWN, JESUS IS FORMALLY[a] CONDEMNED BY THE SANHEDRIN

Friday


  Mark 15:1              |Matt. 27:1             |Luke 22:66-71
                         |                       |
   1   And straightway   | 1   Now when morning  |66   And as soon as
     in the morning the  |   was come, all the   |   it was day, the
     chief priests with  |   chief priests and   |   assembly of the
     the elders and      |   the elders of the   |   elders of the
     scribes, and the    |   people took counsel |   people was
     whole council, held |   against Jesus to put|   gathered together,
     a consultation,     |   him to death:       |   both chief priests
                         |                       |   and scribes; and
                         |                       |   they led him away
  67 into their council, saying, If thou art the Christ, tell us. But
  68 he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe: and if I
  69 ask _you_, ye will not answer. But from henceforth shall the Son
     of man be seated on the right hand of the power of God [_see Ps.
  70 110:1; Dan. 7:13_]. And they all said, Art thou then the Son of
  71 God? And he said unto them, [1]Ye say that I am. And they said,
     What further need have we of witness? for we ourselves have heard
     from his own mouth.

     [Footnote 1: Or, _Ye say_ it, _because I am._]

[Footnote a: This ratification of the condemnation after dawn was an
effort to make the action legal. But no ratification of a wrong can make
it right. Some modern Jewish writers admit the illegalities and argue the
unhistorical character of the narrative. But the hate of the Sanhedrin
for Jesus made them violate their own rules of legal procedure. See my
book, _The Pharisees and Jesus_.]




Sect. 158. REMORSE AND SUICIDE OF JUDAS THE BETRAYER

IN THE TEMPLE AND IN A PLACE WITHOUT THE WALLS OF JERUSALEM

Friday morning


  Matt. 27:3-10                     |Acts 1:18, 19
                                    |

   5 thou _to it_. And he cast down |   is, The field of blood.)
     the pieces of silver into the  |
     sanctuary, and departed; and he|
   6 went away and hanged himself. And the chief priests took the
     pieces of silver, and said, It is not lawful to put them into the
     [2]treasury, since it is the price of blood [_see Deut. 23:18_].
   7 And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to
   8 bury strangers in. Wherefore that field was called, The field of
   9 blood, unto this day. Then was fulfilled that which was spoken
     [3]by Jeremiah the prophet, saying, And [4]they took the thirty
     pieces of silver, the price of him that was priced, [5]whom
  10 _certain_ of the children of Israel did price; and [6]they gave
     them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me [_see Zech.
     11:13; Jer. 18:2; 19:2; 32:6-15_].

                  |                |                |   said unto them,
     Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law. The Jews
     said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:
  32 that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake,
     signifying by what manner of death he should die.

   2 And Pilate   |   governor     | 3 And Pilate   |   called Jesus,
     asked him,   |   asked him,   |   asked him,   |   and said unto
     Art thou the |   saying, Art  |   saying, Art  |   him, Art thou
     King of the  |   thou the King|   thou the King|   the King of the
     Jews? And he |   of the Jews? |   of the Jews? |34 Jews? Jesus
     answering    |   And Jesus    |   And he       |   answered,
     saith unto   |   said unto    |   answered him |   Sayest thou
     him, Thou    |   him, Thou    |   and said,    |   this of

                  |                |                |   thee concerning
  35 me? Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief
  36 priests delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done? Jesus
     answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of
     this world, then would my [3]servants fight, that I should not be
     delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.
  37 Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus
     answered, [4]Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end have I been
     born, and to this end am I come into the world, that I should bear
     witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my
  38 voice. Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said
                  |                |                |   this, he went
                  |                |                |   out again unto
                  |                | 4 And Pilate   |   the Jews, and
                  |                |   said unto the|   saith unto
                  |                |   chief priests|   them, I find no

  Luke 23:6-12

   6   But when Pilate heard it, he asked whether the man were a
   7 Galilean. And when he knew that he was of Herod's jurisdiction, he
     sent him unto Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem in these
     days.
   8   Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was of a
     long time desirous to see him, because he had heard concerning
   9 him;[a] and he hoped to see some [1]miracle done by him. And he
  10 questioned him in many words; but he answered him nothing. And the
  11 chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him. And
     Herod with his soldiers set him at nought, and mocked him, and
  12 arraying him in gorgeous apparel sent him back to Pilate. And
     Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day: for
     before they were at enmity between themselves.

                  |                |   and release   |   Jews answered
     But they     |   But they     |   him.          |   him, We have a
     cried out    |   cried out    |                 |   law, and by
     exceedingly, |   exceedingly, |                 |   that law he
     Crucify him. |   saying, Let  |                 |   ought to die,
                  |   him be       |                 |   because he
                  |   crucified.   |                 |   made himself
                  |                |                 |   the Son of
                  |                |                 | 8 God. When
   9 Pilate therefore heard this saying, he was the more afraid; and he
     entered into the [3]palace again, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art
  10 thou? But Jesus gave him no answer. Pilate therefore saith unto
     him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have
  11 [7]power to release thee, and have [7]power to crucify thee? Jesus
     answered him, Thou wouldest have no [7]power against me, except it
     were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto
     thee hath greater sin.
  12   Upon this Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out,
     saying, If thou release this man, thou art not Caesar's friend:
     every one that maketh himself a king [8]speaketh against Caesar.
  13 When Pilate therefore heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and
     sat down on the judgement-seat at a place called The Pavement, but
  14 in Hebrew, Gabbatha. Now it was the Preparation of the passover:
     it was about the sixth hour.[a] And he saith unto the Jews,
                  |                |                 |   Behold, your
                  |                |                 |15 King! They
                  |                |23 But they were |   therefore
                  |                |   instant with  |   cried out,
                  |                |   loud voices,  |   Away with
                  |                |   asking that he|   _him_, away
                  |                |   might be      |   with _him_,
                  |                |   crucified.    |   crucify him.
                  |                |                 |   Pilate saith
                  |                |                 |   unto them,
                  |                |                 |   Shall I
                  |                |                 |   crucify your
                  |                |                 |   King? The
                  |                |                 |   chief priests
                  |                |                 |   answered, We
                  |                |                 |   have no king
                  |                |                 |   but Caesar.
                  |24 So when      |   And their     |
                  |   Pilate saw   |   voices        |

[Footnote a: It appears that John, who wrote in Asia Minor, long after
the destruction of Jerusalem, makes the day begin at midnight, as the
Greeks and Romans did. We seem compelled so to understand him in 20:19
(comp. Luke 24:29-39); and in no passage of his Gospel is that view
unsuitable. Here then we understand that Pilate passed the sentence about
sunrise, which at the Passover, near the vernal equinox, would be 6
o'clock. The intervening three hours might be occupied in preparations,
and the Crucifixion occurred at 9 o'clock, viz. the third hour as counted
by the Jews (Mark 15:25).]

[Footnote b: Pilate, of course, could not escape full legal and moral
responsibility for his cowardly surrender to the Sanhedrin to keep his
own office. The guilt of the Sanhedrin (both Pharisees and Sadducees
unite in the demand for the blood of Jesus) is beyond dispute. It is
impossible to make a mere political issue out of it and to lay all the
blame on the Sadducees, who feared a revolution. The Pharisees began the
attacks against Jesus on theological and ecclesiastical grounds. The
Sadducees later joined the conspiracy against Christ. Judas was a mere
tool of the Sanhedrin, who had his resentments and grievances to avenge.
There is guilt enough for all the plotters in the greatest wrong of the
ages.]

     coming, in which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the
  30 wombs that never bare, and the breasts that never gave suck. Then
     shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the
  31 hills, Cover us [_see Hos. 10:8_]. For if they do these things in
     the green tree, what shall be done in the dry?

[Footnote a: Golgotha is the Aramaic word for "skull," and Calvary is the
Latin word. The place cannot have been where the so-called "Church of the
Holy Sepulchre" stands, far within the walls. There is of late a rapidly
growing agreement that it was the northern end of the Temple hill, whose
rounded summit (without the city wall), and southern face with holes in
the rock, looks at a little distance much like a skull. This place
fulfils all the conditions.]




Sect. 164. THE FIRST THREE HOURS ON THE CROSS

_From nine A.M. till noon on Friday (three sayings of Jesus; the soldiers

     his mother's sister, Mary the _wife_ of Cleopas, and Mary
  26 Magdalene. When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple
     standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman,
  27 behold, thy son! Then saith he to the disciple, Behold, thy
     mother! And from that hour the disciple took her unto his own
     _home_.

during this period of three hours, since the Gospels do not present them
in the same detail or order. On the whole it has seemed best simply to
follow Mark's arrangement as we have done uniformly in the Harmony. Thus
the apparent order of the sayings is (1) The Prayer for Christ's enemies
in Luke 23:34. (2) The Promise to the Repentant Robber in Luke 23:43. (3)
The Charge to the Mother of Jesus and to the Beloved Disciple in John
19:26, 27. These three sayings are with reference to others.]

Victory, John 19:30. (4) The Cry of Resignation, Luke 23:46. These four
sayings of Jesus are with reference to himself.]

Sect. 167. THE BURIAL OF THE BODY OF JESUS IN THE TOMB OF JOSEPH OF
ARIMATHEA AFTER PROOF OF HIS DEATH

Friday afternoon before 6 P.M.


  Mark 15:42-46   |Matt. 27:57-60  |Luke 23:50-54   |John 19:31-42
                  |                |                |
                  |                |                |31     The Jews
                  |                |                |   therefore,
     because it was the Preparation, that the bodies should not remain
     on the cross upon the sabbath (for the day of that sabbath was a
     high _day_), asked of Pilate that their legs might be broken, and
  32 _that_ they might be taken away. The soldiers therefore came, and
     brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified
  33 with him: but when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead
  34 already, they brake not his legs: howbeit one of the soldiers with
     a spear pierced his side, and straightway there came out blood and
  35 water. And he that hath seen hath borne witness, and his witness
     is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye also may
  36 believe. For these things came to pass, that the scripture might
     be fulfilled [_see Ex. 12:46; Num. 9:12; Ps. 34:20_], A bone of
  37 him shall not be [3]broken. And again another scripture saith
     [_see Zech. 12:10. Deut. 21:22-23; Ex. 34:24_], They shall look on
                  |                |                |   him whom they
                  |                |                |   pierced.
  42   And when   |57   And when   |                |
     even was now |   even was     |                |
     come, because|   come,        |                |
     it was the   |                |                |
     Preparation, |                |                |
     that is, the |                |                |
     day before   |                |                |
     the sabbath, |                |50   And behold,|38   And after
  43 there came   |   there came a |   a man named  |   these things
     Joseph of    |   rich man from|   Joseph, who  |   Joseph of

     Pilate       |                |                |
     marvelled if |                |                |

     unto him the |                |                |
     centurion, he|                |                |
     asked him    |                |                |
     whether he   |                |                |
     [1]had been  |                |                |

  45 dead. And    |                |                |
     when he      |                |                |
     learned it of|                |                |

Sect. 168. THE WATCH OF THE WOMEN BY THE TOMB OF JESUS

_The women maintain their watch and rest on the Sabbath (beginning 6
P.M.) while the Pharisees have a guard of Roman soldiers to keep watch
over the Roman seal on the tomb._

Friday afternoon till Saturday afternoon

                         |                       |56 And they returned,
                         |                       |   and prepared

                         |   chief priests and   |
  63 the Pharisees were gathered together unto Pilate, saying, Sir, we
     remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After
  64 three days I rise again. Command therefore that the sepulchre be
     made sure until the third day, lest haply his disciples come and
     steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the
  65 dead: and the last error will be worse than the first. Pilate said
     unto them, [1]Ye have a guard: go your way, [2]make it _as_ sure
  66 as ye can. So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the
     stone, the guard being with them.

     [Footnote 1: Or, _Take a guard_.]

     [Footnote 2: Gr. _make it sure, as ye know_.]

[Footnote a: Luke (23:54) notes that "the Sabbath drew on" after the
burial on Friday afternoon. The Sabbath began at 6 P.M. Then Luke notes
that the women rested during the Sabbath (our Friday night and
Saturday).]




PART XIV

THE RESURRECTION, APPEARANCES, AND ASCENSION OF CHRIST

_During forty days beginning with Sunday after the death of Christ.
Spring of A.D. 30 (or 29). Judea and Galilee.[a] Sects. 169-184._

[Footnote a: Of this period we see that he remained at or near Jerusalem
for a week. Then he probably left at once for Galilee (Matt. 28:7; Mark
16:7). In the month that followed we cannot fix the exact time of the
events that occurred in Galilee, but just at the end of the forty days we
find him again in Jerusalem.]




Sect. 169. THE VISIT OF THE WOMEN TO THE TOMB OF JESUS

_They watch the tomb late on the Sabbath (our Saturday afternoon); and
the purchase of spices by them after the Sabbath (after 6 P.M. Saturday)
on the first day of the week._

                                    |   sepulchre.
   1   And when the sabbath was     |
     past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary |
     the _mother_ of James, and     |
     Salome, bought spices, that    |
     they might come and anoint him.|

[Footnote a: This phrase once gave much trouble, but the usage of the
vernacular _Koine_ Greek amply justifies the translation. The visit of
the women to inspect the tomb was thus made before the sabbath was over
(before 6 P.M. on Saturday). But the same Greek idiom was occasionally
used in the sense of "after." See Robertson, Grammar of the Greek New
Testament in the Light of Historical Research, p. 645. The distance from
Bethany to Golgotha was not more than a sabbath day's journey. The spices
could be purchased after sundown either in Bethany or Jerusalem. It must
be borne in mind that the Jewish First Day of the Week began at 6 P.M. on
our Saturday.]




Sect. 170. THE EARTHQUAKE, THE ROLLING AWAY OF THE STONE BY AN ANGEL, AND
THE FRIGHT OF THE ROMAN WATCHERS

Sunday before sunrise


  Matt. 28:2-4

   2   And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the
     Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled away the stone, and
   3 sat upon it. His appearance was as lightning, and his raiment white
   4 as snow: and for fear of him the watchers did quake, and became as
     dead men.

     [Footnote 4: Some ancient authorities omit _He is not here, but is

[Footnote a: So he had already risen at early dawn on the first day of
the week. He was buried (Sect. 167) shortly before sunset on Friday, and
at sunset the sabbath began. So he lay in the tomb a small part of
Friday, all of Saturday, and 10 or 11 hours of Sunday. This corresponds
exactly with the seven times repeated statement that he would or did rise
"on the third day," which _could not possibly_ mean after 72 hours. The
phrase two or three times given, "after three days," naturally denoted
for Jews, as for Greeks and Romans, a whole central day and any part of a
first and third, thus agreeing with "on the third day." Even the "three
days and three nights" of Matt. 12:40 need not, according to known Jewish
usage, mean more than we have described. So these expressions _can_ be
reconciled with "on the third day," and with the facts as recorded, while
"on the third day" _cannot_ mean after 72 hours. See Note 13 at end of
the Harmony for full discussion of the question. There is no real appeal
from the testimony of Luke, who gives the whole period. Luke states that
Jesus was buried just before the sabbath "drew on" (our Friday evening);
that the women rested during the sabbath (our Saturday), and that Jesus
was already risen early Sunday morning when the women came to the tomb.]

  14 while we slept. And if this [1]come to the governor's ears, we

  12   And after these things he was|13   And behold, two of them were
     manifested in another form unto|   going that very day to a
     two of them, as they walked, on|   village named Emmaus, which was
  13 their way into the country. And|   threescore furlongs from
     they went away and told it unto|14 Jerusalem. And they communed
     the rest: neither believed they|   with each other of all these
     them.                          |15 things which had happened. And
                                    |   it came to pass, while they
                                    |   communed and questioned
  16 together, that Jesus himself drew near, and went with them. But
  17 their eyes were holden that they should not know him. And he said
     unto them, [1]What communications are these that ye have one with
  18 another, as ye walk? And they stood still, looking sad. And one of
     them, named Cleopas, answering said unto him, [2]Dost thou alone
     sojourn in Jerusalem and not know the things which are come to
  19 pass there in these days? And he said unto them, What things? And
     they said unto him, The things concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which
     was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the
  20 people: and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up
  21 to be condemned to death, and crucified him. But we hoped that it
     was he which should redeem Israel. Yea and beside all this, it is
  22 now the third day since these things came to pass. Moreover
     certain women of our company amazed us, having been early at the
  23 tomb; and when they found not his body, they came, saying, that
     they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was
  24 alive. And certain of them that were with us went to the tomb, and
  25 found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not. And
     he said unto them, O foolish men, and slow of heart to believe
  26 [3]in all that the prophets have spoken! Behoved it not the Christ
  27 to suffer these things, and to enter into his glory? And beginning
     from Moses and from all the prophets, he interpreted to them in
  28 all the scriptures the things concerning himself. And they drew
     nigh unto the village, whither they were going: and he made as
  29 though he would go further. And they constrained him, saying,
     Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is now far
  30 spent. And he went in to abide with them. And it came to pass,
     when he had sat down with them to meat, he took the [4]bread, and
  31 blessed it, and brake, and gave to them. And their eyes were
  32 opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight. And
     they said one to another, Was not our heart burning within us,
     while he spake to us in the way, while he opened to us the
     scriptures?

WITH A COMMISSION AND THEIR FAILURE TO CONVINCE THOMAS

Jerusalem. Sunday evening

  Mark 16:14             |Luke 24:36-43          |John 20:19-25
                         |                       |
                         |                       |19   When therefore it
                         |                       |   was evening, on
                         |                       |   that day, the
                         |                       |   first _day_ of the
                         |                       |   week, and when the
  14   And afterward he  |36   And as they spake |   doors were shut
     was manifested unto |   these things, he    |   where the
     the eleven          |   himself stood in the|   disciples were,
     themselves as they  |   midst of them,      |   for fear of the
     sat at meat;        |   [1]and saith unto   |   Jews, Jesus came
                         |   them, Peace _be_    |   and stood in the
                         |37 unto you. But they  |   midst, and saith
                         |   were terrified and  |   unto them, Peace
                         |   affrighted, and     |   _be_ unto you.
                         |   supposed that they  |
                         |   beheld a spirit.    |
     and he upbraided    |                       |
     them with their     |                       |
     unbelief and        |                       |
     hardness of heart,  |                       |
     because they        |                       |
     believed not them   |                       |
     which had seen him  |                       |
     after he was risen. |                       |
                         |38 And he said unto    |
                         |   them, Why are ye    |
                         |   troubled? and       |
                         |   wherefore do        |
                         |   reasonings arise in |
                         |39 your heart? See my  |20 And when he had
                         |   hands and my feet,  |   said this, he
                         |   that it is I myself:|   shewed unto them
                         |   handle me, and see; |   his hands and his
                         |   for a spirit hath   |   side.
                         |   not flesh and bones,|
                         |   as ye behold me     |
                         |40 having. [2]And when |
                         |   he had said this, he|
                         |   shewed them his     |
                         |   hands and his feet. |
                         |41 And while they still|
                         |   disbelieved for joy,|
                         |   and wondered, he    |
                         |   said unto them, Have|
                         |   ye here anything to |
                         |42 eat? And they gave  |
                         |   him a piece of a    |
                         |   broiled fish.[3] And|
                         |   he took it, and did |
                         |   eat before them.    |
                         |                       |   The disciples
                         |                       |   therefore were
  21 glad, when they saw the Lord. Jesus therefore said to them again,
     Peace _be_ unto you: as the Father hath sent me, even so send I
  22 you. And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith
  23 unto them, Receive ye the [4]Holy Ghost: whose soever sins ye
     forgive, they are forgiven unto them; whose soever _sins_ ye
     retain, they are retained.[a]
  24   But Thomas, one of the twelve, called [5]Didymus, was not with
  25 them when Jesus came. The other disciples therefore said unto him,
     We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see
     in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the
     print of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not
     believe.

Sect. 179. THE APPEARANCE TO THE DISCIPLES THE NEXT SUNDAY NIGHT AND THE
CONVINCING OF THOMAS

Jerusalem


  John 20:26-31                     |1 Cor. 15:5
                                    |
  26   And after eight days again   | 5 [and that he appeared to
     his disciples were within, and |   Cephas;] then to the twelve;
     Thomas with them. Jesus cometh,|
     the doors being shut, and stood|
  27 in the midst, and said, Peace _be_ unto you. Then saith he to
     Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and see my hands; and reach
     _hither_ thy hand, and put it into my side: and be not faithless,
  28 but believing. Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my
  29 God. Jesus saith unto him, Because thou hast seen me, [1]thou hast
     believed: blessed _are_ they that have not seen, and _yet_ have
     believed.
  30   Many other signs therefore did Jesus in the presence of the
  31 disciples, which are not written in this book: but these are
     written, that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of
     God; and that believing ye may have life in his name.

Sect. 180. THE APPEARANCE TO SEVEN DISCIPLES BESIDE THE SEA OF
GALILEE.[a] THE MIRACULOUS DRAUGHT OF FISHES


  John 21

   1   After these things Jesus manifested himself again to the
     disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and he manifested _himself_ on
   2 this wise. There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called
     [1]Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the _sons_ of
   3 Zebedee, and two other of his disciples. Simon Peter saith unto
     them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also come with thee.
     They went forth, and entered into the boat; and that night they
   4 took nothing. But when day was now breaking, Jesus stood on the
   5 beach: howbeit the disciples knew not that it was Jesus. Jesus
     therefore said unto them, Children, have ye aught to eat? They
   6 answered him, No. And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right
     side of the boat, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now
   7 they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes. That
     disciple therefore whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the
     Lord. So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his
   8 coat about him (for he was naked), and cast himself into the sea.
     But the other disciples came in the little boat (for they were not
     far from the land, but about two hundred cubits off), dragging the
   9 net _full_ of fishes. So when they got out upon the land, they see
     [2]a fire of coals there, and [3]fish laid thereon, and [4]bread.
  10 Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now taken.
  11 Simon Peter therefore went [5]up, and drew the net to land, full
     of great fishes, a hundred and fifty and three: and for all there
  12 were so many, the net was not rent. Jesus saith unto them, Come
     _and_ break your fast. And none of the disciples durst inquire of
  13 him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord. Jesus cometh, and
  14 taketh the [6]bread, and giveth them, and the fish likewise. This
     is now the third time that Jesus was manifested to the disciples,
     after he was risen from the dead.
  15   So when they had broken their fast, Jesus saith to Simon Peter,
     Simon, _son_ of [7]John, [8]lovest thou me more than these? He
     saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I [9]love thee. He
  16 saith unto him, Feed my lambs. He saith to him again a second
     time, Simon, _son_ of [7]John, [8]lovest thou me? He saith unto
     him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I [9]love thee. He saith unto
  17 him, Tend my sheep. He saith unto him the third time, Simon, _son_
     of [7]John, [9]lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said
     unto him the third time, [9]Lovest thou me? And he said unto him,
     Lord, thou knowest all things; thou [10]knowest that I [9]love
  18 thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep. Verily, verily, I say
     unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and
     walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou
     shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and
  19 carry thee whither thou wouldest not. Now this he spake,
     signifying by what manner of death he should glorify God. And when
  20 he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me. Peter, turning
     about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also
     leaned back on his breast at the supper, and said, Lord, who is he
  21 that betrayeth thee? Peter therefore seeing him saith to Jesus,
  22 Lord, [11]and what shall this man do? Jesus saith unto him, If I
     will that he tarry till I come, what _is that_ to thee? follow
  23 thou me. This saying therefore went forth among the brethren, that
     that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, that he
     should not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what _is
     that_ to thee?
  24   This is the disciple which beareth witness of these things, and
     wrote these things: and we know that his witness is true.
  25   And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which
     if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world
     itself would not contain the books that should be written.

Sect. 181. THE APPEARANCE TO ABOVE FIVE HUNDRED[a] ON AN APPOINTED
MOUNTAIN IN GALILEE, AND A COMMISSION GIVEN


  Mark 16:15-18          |Matt. 28:16-20         |1 Cor. 15:6

                         |16   But the eleven    |
                         |   disciples went into |
                         |   Galilee, unto the   |
                         |   mountain where      |
                         |   Jesus had appointed | 6 then he appeared
                         |17 them. And when they |   to above five
                         |   saw him, they       |   hundred brethren
                         |   worshipped _him_:   |   at once, of whom
                         |   but some doubted.   |   the greater part
                         |18 And Jesus came to   |   remain until now,
                         |   them and spake unto |   but some are
                         |   them, saying, All   |   fallen asleep;
                         |   authority hath been |
                         |   given unto me in    |
                         |   heaven and on earth.|
  15   And he said unto  |                       |
     them, Go ye into all|19 Go ye therefore, and|
     the world, and      |   make disciples of   |
     preach the gospel to|   all the nations,    |
     the whole creation. |   baptizing them into |
                         |   the name of the     |
                         |   Father and of the   |
                         |   Son and of the Holy |
                         |20 Ghost: teaching them|
                         |   to observe all      |
                         |   things whatsoever I |
                         |   commanded you:      |
  16 He that believeth   |                       |
     and is baptized     |                       |
     shall be saved; but |                       |
     he that disbelieveth|                       |
     shall be condemned. |                       |
  17 And these signs     |                       |
     shall follow them   |                       |
     that believe: in my |                       |
     name shall they cast|                       |
     out [3]devils; they |                       |
     shall speak with    |                       |
  18 [4]new tongues; they|                       |
     shall take up       |                       |
     serpents, and if    |                       |
     they drink any      |                       |
     deadly thing, it    |                       |
     shall in no wise    |                       |
     hurt them; they     |                       |
     shall lay hands on  |                       |
     the sick, and they  |                       |
     shall recover.      |                       |

                         |   unto [2]the end of  |

was most probably that which Jesus had appointed (Matt. 28:16), and it
could be held on an appointed mountain without attracting the attention
of unbelievers.--The Commission in Mark may perhaps be reckoned the same
as Matthew's here. A third Commission is given by Luke in Sect. 183. This
is what is called by many the Great Commission.]

  44   And he said unto them, These | 3 to whom he also [3]shewed
     are my words which I spake unto|   himself alive after his passion
     you, while I was yet with you, |   by many proofs, appearing unto
     how that all things must needs |   them by the space of forty
     be fulfilled, which are written|   days, and speaking the things
     in the law of Moses, and the   |   concerning the kingdom of God:
     prophets, and the psalms,      | 4 and, [4]being assembled together
  45 concerning me. Then opened he  |   with them, he charged them not
     their mind, that they might    |   to depart from Jerusalem, but
  46 understand the scriptures; and |   to wait for the promise of the

Sect. 184. THE LAST APPEARANCE AND THE ASCENSION

On Olivet between Jerusalem and Bethany


  Mark 16:19, 20         |Luke 24:50-53          |Acts 1:9-12
                         |                       |
                         |50   And he led them   |
                         |   out until _they     |
                         |   were_ over against  |
                         |   Bethany: and he     |
                         |   lifted up his hands,|

EXPLANATORY NOTES ON POINTS OF SPECIAL DIFFICULTY IN THE HARMONY


_1. About Harmonies of the Gospels_

We do not know how soon an effort was made to combine in one book the
several portrayals of the life of Jesus. Luke in his Gospel (1:1-4)
makes a selection of the material and incorporates data from different
sources, but with the stamp of his own arrangement and style. He
followed, in the main, the order of Mark's Gospel, as is easily seen.
But this method is not what is meant by a harmony of the Gospels, for
the result is a selection from all sorts of material (oral and written),
monographs and longer treatises.

The first known harmony is Tatian's Diatessaron (_dia tessaron_, by
four) in the second century (about 160 A.D.) in the Syriac tongue. It
was long lost, but an Arabic translation has been found and an English
rendering appeared in 1894 by J. Hamlyn Hill. It is plain that Tatian
has blended into one narrative our Four Gospels with a certain amount of
freedom as is shown by Hobson's _The Diatessaron of Tatian and the
Synoptic Problem_ (1904). There have been modern attempts also to
combine into one story the records of the Four Gospels. There is a
superficial advantage in such an effort in the freedom from variations
in the accounts, but the loss is too great for such an arbitrary gain.
The word harmony calls for such an arrangement, but it is not the method
of the best modern harmonies which preserve the differences in material
and style just as they are in the Four Gospels.

In the third century Ammonius arranged the Gospels in four parallel
columns (the _Sections_ of Ammonius). This was an attempt to give a
conspectus of the material in the Gospels side by side. In the fourth
century Eusebius with his _Canons_ and _Sections_ enabled the reader to
see at a glance the parallel passages in the Gospels. The ancients took
a keen interest in this form of study of the Gospels, as Augustine
shows.

Of modern harmonies that by Edward Robinson has had the most influence.
The edition in English appeared in 1845, that in Greek in 1846. Riddle
revised Robinson's Harmony in 1889. There were many others that employed
the Authorized Version, like Clark's, and that divided the life of
Christ according to the feasts.

Broadus (June, 1893) followed Waddy (1887) in the use of the Canterbury
Revision, but was the first to break away from the division by feasts
and to show the historical development in the life of Jesus. Stevens and
Burton followed (December, 1893) Broadus within six months and, like
him, used the Canterbury Revision and had an independent division of the
life of Christ to show the historical unfolding of the events. These two
harmonies have held the field for nearly thirty years for students of
the English Gospels. In 1903 Kerr issued one in the American Standard
Version and James one in the Canterbury Revision (1901).

Harmonies of the Gospels in the Greek continued to appear, like
Tischendorf's (1851, new edition 1891), Wright's _A Synopsis of the
Gospels in Greek_ (1903), Huck's _Synopse der drei ersten Evangelien_
(1892, English translation in 1907), Campbell's _First Three Gospels in
Greek_ (1899), _A Harmony of the Synoptic Gospels in Greek_ by Burton
and Goodspeed (1920).

The progress in synoptic criticism emphasized the difference in subject
matter and style between the Synoptic Gospels and the Fourth Gospel as
appears in the works of Huck, Campbell, and Burton and Goodspeed that
give only the Synoptic Gospels. Burton and Goodspeed have also an
English work, _A Harmony of the Synoptic Gospels for Historical and
Critical Study_ (1917). In 1917 Sharman (_Records of the Life of Jesus_)
gives first a harmony of the Synoptic Gospels with references to the
Fourth Gospel and then an outline of the Fourth Gospel with references
to the Synoptic Gospels.

Once more in 1919 Van Kirk produced _The Source Book of the Life of
Christ_ which is only a partial harmony, for the parables and speeches
of Jesus are only referred to, not quoted. But he endeavored to show the
results of Gospel criticism in the text of the book. There is much
useful material here for a harmony, but it is not a real harmony that
can be used for the full story of the life of Jesus. Van Kirk, however,
is the first writer to place Mark in the first column instead of
Matthew. I had already done it in my outline before I saw Van Kirk's
book, but his was published first. It is an immense improvement to put
Mark first. The student thus sees that the arrangement of the material
is not arbitrary and whimsical, but orderly and natural. Both Matthew
and Luke follow Mark's order except in the first part of Matthew where
he is topical in the main. John supplements the Synoptic Gospels,
particularly in the Judean (Jerusalem) Ministry.

Slowly, therefore, progress has been made in the harmonies of the
Gospels. But the modern student is able to reproduce the life and words
of Jesus as has not been possible since the first century. It is a
fourfold portrait of Christ that we get, but the whole is infinitely
richer than the picture given by any one of the Four Gospels. The
present Harmony aims to put the student in touch with the results of
modern scholarly research and to focus attention on the actual story in
the Gospels themselves. One may have his own opinion of the Fourth
Gospel, but it is needed in a harmony for completeness.


_2. Synoptic Criticism_

The criticism of the synoptic gospels has been able to reach a broad
general conclusion that is likely to stand the test of time. The reason
for this happy solution lies in the fact that the processes and results
can be tested. It is not mere subjective speculation. Any one who knows
how to weigh evidence can compare Mark, Matthew, and Luke in the
English, and still better in the Greek. The pages of the present harmony
offer proof enough. It is plain as a pikestaff that both our Matthew and
Luke used practically all of Mark and followed his general order of
events. For this reason Mark has been placed first on the pages where
this Gospel appears at all. But another thing is equally clear and that
is that both Matthew and Luke had another source in common because they
each give practically identical matter for much that is not in Mark at
all. This second common source for Matthew and Luke has been called
Logia because it is chiefly discourses. It is sometimes referred to as
"Q", the first letter of the German word _Quelle_ (source).
Unfortunately we do not have the whole of the Logia (Q) before us as in
the case of Mark, though we probably do not possess the original ending
of Mark in 16:9-20. But we can at least reproduce what is preserved.
Still, just as sometimes either Matthew or Luke made use of Mark, so in
the case of the Logia that is probably true. Hence we cannot tell the
precise limits of the Logia. Besides, a small part of Mark is not
employed by either Matthew or Luke and that may be true of the Logia.
But the fact of these two sources for Matthew and Luke seems to be
proven.

But there are various other points to be observed. One is that both
Matthew and Luke may have had various other sources. Luke tells us (Luke
1:1-4) that he made use of "many" such sources, both oral and written.
And a large part of Luke does not appear in the other gospels or at
least similar events and sayings occur in different environments and
times. Hence our solid conclusion must allow freedom and flexibility to
the writers in various ways. We can see for ourselves how Matthew and
Luke handled both Mark and the Logia, each in his own way and with
individual touches of style and purpose.

One other matter calls for attention. Papias is quoted by Eusebius as
saying that Matthew wrote in Hebrew (or Aramaic) whereas our present
Matthew is in Greek. It is now commonly held that the real Matthew
(Levi) wrote the Logia first in Aramaic and that either he or some one
else used that with Mark and other sources for our present Gospel of
Matthew.

It should be added also that there is a considerable body of evidence
for the view that Mark wrote under the influence of Simon Peter and
preserves the vividness and freshness of Peter's own style as an
eyewitness.

One other result has come. It is increasingly admitted that the Logia
was very early, before 50 A.D., and Mark likewise if Luke wrote the Acts
while Paul was still alive. Luke's Gospel comes (Acts 1:1) before the
Acts. The date of Acts is still in dispute, but the early date (about
A.D. 63) is gaining support constantly. The upshot of these centuries of
synoptic criticism has brought into sharp outline the facts that now
stand out with reasonable clearness. There are many points in dispute
still, but we at least know how the synoptic gospels were written, and
are reasonably certain of the dates and the authors.

There are many good books on the subject, like Hawkin's _Horae
Synopticae_ (second edition), Sanday's _Oxford Studies in the Synoptic
Problem_, Harnack's _Sayings of Jesus_ and his _Date of the Synoptic
Gospels and Acts_. My own views appear in my _Commentary on Matthew_
(Bible for Home and School), _Studies in Mark's Gospel_, and _Luke the
Historian in the Light of Research_.


_3. The Authorship of the Fourth Gospel_

It has come to pass that one has to defend the use of the Fourth Gospel
on a par with the Synoptic Gospels. The Johannine problem is an old one
and a difficult one. It cannot be said that modern scholarship has come
to a clear result here, as is true of the Synoptic Gospels. As a matter
of fact, the battle still rages vigorously. There are powerful arguments
on both sides. A mere sketch of the real situation is all that can be
attempted here.

The Gospel and the Epistles are in the same style and can be confidently
affirmed to be by the same author. The Apocalypse has some striking
peculiarities of its own. There are likenesses in vocabulary and idiom
beyond a doubt of a subtle nature, but the grammatical irregularities in
the Book of Revelation have long been a puzzle to those who hold to the
Johannine authorship. A full discussion of these grammatical details can
be found in the leading commentaries on the Apocalypse. A brief survey
is given in my _Grammar of the Greek New Testament in the Light of
Historical Research_. The facts are undisputed and have a most
interesting parallel in the papyri fragments of some of the less
educated writers of the _Koine_ as one can see for himself in Milligan's
_Greek Papyri_ or in any other collection.

There are two solutions of the problem with two alternatives in each
instance. There are those who roundly assert that the same man could not
have written both the Gospel and the Apocalypse. Some of these affirm
that the Apostle John wrote the Apocalypse but not the Gospel. Certainly
a "John" wrote the Revelation or claimed it at any rate. Others of this
group hold that an inferential Presbyter John (not "the elder" in 2 and
3 John) supposed to be meant by Papias wrote the Apocalypse while some
one else wrote the Gospel whether the Apostle John or not.

But a considerable body of scholars still hold that the same man wrote
both the Gospel and the Apocalypse, but a different explanation is
offered by two groups. One class of writers affirm that John wrote the
Apocalypse first before he had come to be at home in the Greek idiom as
we see it in the Gospel and the Epistles. We know that John and Peter
were fishermen and were not considered men of literary training by the
Sanhedrin (Acts 4:14). This explanation is sufficient but for the
further fact that the early date of the Apocalypse (about 70 A.D.) is
not now so generally held to be true. The later or Domitianic date as
given by Irenaeus seems pretty clearly to be correct. So the other group
suggest that the books may belong substantially to the same period (the
Domitianic date) and that the explanation of the grammatical
infelicities in the Apocalypse may be due to the fact that John being on
the Isle of Patmos when he wrote did not have the benefit of friends in
Ephesus who apparently read the Gospel (John 21:24-25). Besides, the
excited state of John's mind because of the visions may have added to
the number of the solecisms in the Apocalypse. This view I personally
hold as probable. The unity of both Gospel and Apocalypse is denied by
some.

So the matter stands as between the Gospel and the Apocalypse. But the
Fourth Gospel has difficulties of its own. These relate in part to the
book in itself. It is true there is a great similarity in language and
style between the narrative parts of the book and the discourses of
Jesus. It is affirmed that the writer has colored the speeches of Jesus
with his own style or even made up the dialogues so that they are
without historical value or at least on a much lower plane than the
Synoptic Gospels as objective history. There is something in this point,
but one must remember that the Synoptic Gospels vary in their manner of
reporting the speeches of Jesus and aim to give the substance rather
than the precise words of the Master in all instances. It is at most a
matter of degree. There is a Johannine type of thought and phrase beyond
a doubt, but curiously enough we have a paragraph in Matthew 11:24-31
and Luke 10:21-23 that is precisely like the Johannine specimens,
written long before the Fourth Gospel. One must remember the versatility
of Jesus, who could not be retained in any one style or mold. But there
are those who admit the Johannine authorship of the Gospel and yet who
refuse to put it on the same plane as the Synoptic Gospels. Every one
must decide for himself on this point. For myself I see too much of
Christ in the Fourth Gospel in the most realistic and dramatic form to
be mere invention. We can enlarge our conception of Christ to make room
for the Fourth Gospel.

But even so it is urged that the Beloved Disciple cannot be the Apostle
John. If not, then the Fourth Gospel ignores the Apostle John,--a very
curious situation. It is a long story for which one must go to the able
books in defense of the Johannine authorship by Ezra Abbott, James
Drummond, W. Sanday, Luthardt, Watkins and many others. The ablest
modern attacks are made by Bacon and Wendt and Schmiedel. My own view is
given in my _The Divinity of Christ in the Gospel of John_.


_4. The Jesus of History_

It is not long since the cry of "Back to Christ" was raised and away
from Paul and John. Soon this cry was changed to an appeal to the Jesus
of History in opposition to the Christ of Theology. So we had the "Jesus
or Christ" controversy (see the Hibbert Journal Supplement for 1909). It
was gravely affirmed by some that Paul had created the Christ of
Christianity and had permanently altered the simple program of Jesus for
a social Kingdom and had turned it into a great ecclesiastical system
with speculative Christological interpretations quite beyond the range
of the vision of the Jesus of the Synoptic Gospels. It was admitted that
the Fourth Gospel, the Apocalypse, and the Epistles all gave the Pauline
view.

To the Synoptic Gospels, therefore, we all went. But the Christ of Paul
and of John is in the Synoptic Gospels. In all essentials the picture is
the same in Luke as in John and Paul. The shading is different, but
Jesus in Luke is the Son of God as well as the Son of Man (see my _Luke
the Historian in the Light of Research_). It was admitted that Matthew
gives the picture of Jesus as the Jewish Messiah. Mark reflects Peter's
conception of Jesus and gives Jesus as Lord and Christ (see my _Studies
in Mark's Gospel_). And Q (the Logia), the earliest document that we
have for the life of Christ and almost contemporary with the time of
Christ, gives the same essential features of Jesus as the Son of Man and
Son of God (see my article _The Christ of the Logia_ in the Contemporary
Review for August, 1919). The sober results of modern critical research
show the same figure in the very earliest documents that we possess (Q
and Mark's Gospel). The Christ of Paul and of John walks as the Jesus of
History in the Synoptic Gospels. We do know the earthly life of Jesus
much more distinctly and the research of centuries has had a blessed
outcome in the enrichment of our knowledge. Matthew and Luke are the
first critics of the sources for the life of Jesus. We see how they made
use of Mark, the Logia, and other documents. The Fourth Gospel comes
last with knowledge of the Synoptic Gospels.

There are, to be sure, a few men who even deny that Jesus ever lived at
all. That was the next step; but this absurdity has met complete
refutation. The Christ of faith is the Christ of fact. There is no
getting away from the fact of Christ, the chief fact of all the ages,
the centre of all history, the hope of the ages. Jesus Christ we can
still call him, our Lord and Saviour, and he never made such an appeal
to men as he does today in the full blaze of modern historical research.
Men are just beginning to take his words to heart in all the spheres of
human life. The one hope of a new world of righteousness lies precisely
in the program of Jesus Christ for the life of the individual in his
private affairs, in his family relations, in his business and social
dealings, in his political ideals and conduct. And nations must also
follow the leadership of Jesus the supreme Teacher of the race.

The purpose of a harmony is not to teach theology, but to make available
for men of any faith the facts in the Gospels concerning Jesus of
Nazareth. Each interprets these facts and teachings as he sees the
light. We can all acknowledge our debt to modern scholarship for the
tremendous contributions made to a richer understanding of the
environment into which Jesus came and to a juster appreciation of the
real significance of his person and his message. The Gospels are still
the most fascinating books in the world for sheer simplicity and beauty.
One can first trace the picture of Jesus in the Logia, then in Mark, in
Matthew, in Luke, in John. To these he can add the pictures of Christ in
the Acts, the Epistles, the Apocalypse.


_6. The Two Genealogies of Christ_

Sceptics of all ages, from Porphyry and Celsus to Strauss, have urged
the impossibility of reconciling the difficulties in the two accounts of
the descent of Jesus. Even Alford says it is impossible to reconcile
them. But certainly several possible explanations have been suggested.
The chief difficulties will be discussed.

1. In Matthew's list several discrepancies are pointed out.

_(a)_ It is objected that Matthew is mistaken in making three sets of
fourteen each. There are only forty-one names, and this would leave one
set with only thirteen. But does Matthew say he has mentioned forty-two
names? He does say (1:17) that there are three sets of fourteen and
divides them for us himself: "So all the generations from Abraham unto
David are fourteen generations; and from David unto the carrying away to
Babylon fourteen generations; and from the carrying away to Babylon unto
the Christ fourteen generations." The points of division are David and
the captivity; in the one case a man, in the other an event. He counts
David in each of the first two sets, although Jechoniah is counted only
once. David was the connecting link between the patriarchal line and the
royal line. But he does not say "from David to Jechoniah," but "from
David to the carrying away unto Babylon," and Josiah is the last name he
counts before that event. And so the first name after this same event is
Jechoniah. Thus Matthew deliberately counts David in two places to give
symmetry to the division, which made an easy help to the memory.

_(b)_ The omissions in Matthew's list have occasioned some trouble.
These omissions are after Joram, the names of Ahaziah, Joash, Amaziah,
and after Josiah, these of Jehoiakim and Eliakim (2 Kings 8:24; 1 Chron.
3:11; 2 Chron. 22:1, 11; 24:27; 2 Kings 23:34; 24:6). But such omissions
were very common in the Old Testament genealogies. See 2 Chron. 22:9.
Here "son of Jehoshaphat" means "grandson of Jehoshaphat." So in Matt.
1:1 Jesus is called the son of David, the son of Abraham. A direct line
of descent is all that it is designed to express. This is all that the
term "begat" necessarily means here. It is a real descent. Whatever
omissions were made for various reasons, would not invalidate the line.
The fact that Ahaziah, Joash, and Amaziah were the sons of Ahab and
Jezebel would be sufficient ground for omitting them.

_(c)_ Matthew mentions four women in his list, which is contrary to
Jewish custom, viz. Tamar, Rahab, Ruth, and the wife of Uriah. But
neither one is counted in the lists of fourteen, and each one has
something remarkable in her case (Broadus, Comm. on Matt. _in loco_).
Three were guilty of gross sin, and one, Ruth, was of Gentile origin and
deserved mention for that reason. This circumstance would seem to
indicate that Matthew did not simply copy the genealogical history of
Joseph. He did this, omitting what suited his purpose and adding
likewise remarks of his own. His record is thus reliable and yet made a
part of his own story.

2. A comparison of the lists of Matthew and Luke.

If no list had been given by Luke, no further explanations would be
necessary. But Luke not only gives a list, but one radically different
from Matthew's, and in inverse order. Matthew begins with Abraham and
comes to Jesus; Luke begins with Jesus and concludes with Adam [the son
of God]. Several explanations are offered to remove the apparent
contradiction.

_(a)_ As early as Julius Africanus it was suggested that the two lines
had united in accordance with the law of Levirate marriage. By this
theory, Heli and Jacob being stepbrothers, Jacob married Heli's widow
and was the real father of Joseph. Thus both genealogies would be the
descent of Joseph, one the real, the other the legal. This theory is
ably advocated by McClellan, pp. 416 ff., and Waddy, p. xvii. It is
argued that Jechoniah's children were born in captivity and so, being
slaves, lost both his royal dignity and his legal status. Stress is laid
upon the word "begat" to show that Matthew's descent must be the natural
pedigree of Joseph, and upon the use of the expression "son (as was
supposed) of Joseph." Hence both Joseph's real and legal standing are
shown, for by Luke's account he had an undisputed legal title to descend
from David. This is certainly possible, although it rests on the
hypothesis of the Levirate marriage.

_(b)_ Lord Arthur Hervey, in his volume on the Genealogies of Our Lord,
and in Smith's Dictionary, argues that Matthew gives Joseph's legal
descent as successor to the throne of David. According to this theory
Solomon's line failed in Jechoniah (Jer. 22:30) and Shealtiel of
Matthew's line took his place. Luke's account, on the other hand, gives
Joseph's real parentage. Matthew's Matthan and Luke's Mattathias are
identified as one, and the law of Levirate marriage comes into service
with Jacob and Heli. This explanation has received favor with such
writers as Mill, Alford, Wordsworth, Ellicott, Westcott, Fairbairn.
McNeile (on Matthew) considers this the "only possible" view. The chief
objection seems to be the most natural meaning of "begat," implying
direct descent, and the necessity for two suppositions, one about
Shealtiel and another about Jacob and Heli. It is even fairly probable
that the Shealtiel and Zerubbabel of Matthew and Luke are different
persons.

_(c)_ The third and most plausible solution yet suggested makes Matthew
give the real descent of Joseph, and Luke the real descent of Mary.
Several arguments of more or less weight can be adduced for this
hypothesis.

(1) The most natural meaning of "begat" in Matthew is preserved.
Jesus goes through David's royal line and so fulfils prophecy. It is not
elsewhere stated that Mary was of Davidic descent, although presumptive
evidence exists in the language of the angel (Luke 1:32) and the
enrollment of Mary (Luke 2:5). So Robinson (Revised edition).

(2) The use of Joseph without the article, while it is used with every
other name in the list. "The absence of the article puts the name
outside of the genealogical series properly so-called."--Godet. This
would seem to indicate that Joseph belonged to the parenthesis, "as was
supposed." It would read thus, "being son (as was supposed of Joseph) of
Heli." Luke had already clearly stated the manner of Christ's birth, so
that no one would think he was the son of Joseph. Jesus would thus be
Heli's grandson, an allowable meaning of "son." See Andrews' (new
edition) _Life of Our Lord_, p. 63.

(3) It would seem proper that Matthew should give the _legal_ descent of
Jesus, since he wrote chiefly for Jews. This, of course, could only be
through Joseph.

(4) And it would seem equally fitting that Luke should give the _real_
genealogy of Jesus, since he was writing for all. And this could come
only through Mary. If it is objected that a woman's genealogy is never
given, it may be replied that women are mentioned for special reasons in
Matthew's list, though not counted, and that Mary's name is not
mentioned in this list. The genealogy goes back to her father either by
skipping her as suggested above and making son mean the grandson of
Heli, or by allowing Joseph to stand in her place in the list, as he
would have to do anyhow. On the whole, then, this theory seems the most
plausible and pleasing. So practically Luther, Bengel, Olshausen,
Lightfoot, Wieseler, Robinson, Alexander, Godet, Weiss, Andrews (new
edition, p. 65), Broadus, and many recent writers.

But Bacon (Genealogy of Jesus Christ, Hastings D. B. and Am. J. of
Theol. Jan., 1911) says that nearly all writers of authority abandon any
effort to reconcile the two pedigrees of Jesus save as the effort of
Christians to give "His Davidic sonship rather than His actual descent."
See Machen's survey of negative criticism, on the subject in Princeton
Theol. Review (Jan., 1906). Barnard (Hastings D. C. G.) admits two
independent accounts, but sees no solution, but Sweet (Int. St. Bible
Encyl.) accepts the view that Matthew gives the real genealogy of Joseph
and Luke that of Mary. Plummer (Comm. on Luke) thinks it incredible that
Mary's genealogy should be given by Luke.


_6. The Probable Time of the Saviour's Birth_

Every one now understands that the accepted date of our Lord's birth is
wrong by several years. The estimates of the true date vary all the way
from one to seven years B.C. There are various data that fix the year
with more or less certainty, but none of them with absolute precision.
They do, however, agree in marking pretty clearly a narrow limit for
this notable occurrence, B.C. 6 or 5.

1. The death of Herod the Great is relied on with most certainty to fix
the year of Christ's birth. The rule of Archelaus and Antipas demands
B.C. 4. Josephus mentions an eclipse of the moon which occurred shortly
before he died. Ant. XVII, 6, 4. This eclipse is the only one alluded to
by Josephus, and fixes with absolute certainty the time after which the
birth of Jesus could not have occurred, since, according to Matt. 2:1-6,
Jesus was born while Herod was still living. The question to be
determined would be the year of this eclipse. Astronomical calculations
name an eclipse of the moon March 12 and 13, in the year of Rome 750,
and no eclipse occurred the following year that was visible in
Palestine. Josephus (Ant. XVII, 8, 1), says that Herod died thirty-seven
years after he was declared king by the Romans. In 714 he was proclaimed
king, and this would bring his death counting from Nisan to Nisan, as
Josephus usually does, "in the year from 1st Nisan 750 to 1st Nisan 751,
according to Jewish computation, at the age of seventy" (Andrews). Herod
died shortly before the Passover of 750, then, according to the eclipse
and the length of his reign. Caspari contends for January 24, 753, as
the date of Herod's death, because there was a total eclipse of the moon
January 10. So he puts his death fourteen days later. Mr. Page (_New
Light from Old Eclipses_) argues for the eclipse that occurred July 17,
752, as the one preceding Herod's death. He thinks that this makes
unnecessary the subtraction of two years from the reign of Tiberius on
the theory that Tiberius was contemporary ruler with Augustus for two
years. But he finds difficulty in lengthening Herod's reign so long, and
his theory has gained no great acceptance as yet. Our present era makes
the birth of Christ in the year of Rome 754, and is due to the Abbot
Dionysius Exiguus in the Sixth Century. Hence it is clear that if Herod
died in the early spring of 750, Jesus must have been born _at least_
four years before 754, the common era, and likely in the year 749.

2. It has been inferred by some that Jesus was at least two or three
years old when Herod slaughtered the infants in Bethlehem, Matt. 2:16.
Thus the year would be put two years further back to the end of 747 or
beginning of 748. But this is not demanded by the "two years" of
Matthew, for Herod would naturally extend the limit so as to be sure to
include the child in the number slain, and a child just entering the
second year would be called "two years" old by Jewish custom. No more
definite note of time comes from this circumstance, save that the
massacre probably took place some months before Herod's death, which
fact would bring the Saviour's birth back some time into the year 749.

3. The appearance of the "star in the east" (Matt. 2:2). This, of
course, was before Herod's death, and would agree in time with the
slaughter of the children, if the star be looked upon as a supernatural
phenomenon, and not the wise men's interpretation of a natural
conjunction of planets. Kepler first suggested that, as there was a
conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn in 747, to which Mars was added in
748, this conjunction might have been the bright star that led on the
wise men. See Wieseler, _Synopsis_, p. 57. Kepler had also suggested
that a periodical star or a comet might have joined the constellation.
The Chinese records preserve the account of the appearance of a comet in
the spring of 749. Either of these theories is fascinating in itself,
especially to those minds that prefer a natural explanation of anything
that looks miraculous. Both phenomena are possible in themselves, but
they hardly meet the requirements of the record in Matthew. (1) The word
used is _aster_, star, and not _astron_, a group of stars. (2) Rev. C.
Pritchard, whose calculations have been verified at Greenwich (Smith's
Dic.), has shown that those "planets could never have appeared as one
star, for they never approached each other within double the apparent
diameter of the moon." So Ideler's hypothesis that the wise men all had
weak eyes seems rather feeble. (3) The year 747 would conflict slightly
with other evidence for Christ's birth that favors 749, although
Wieseler, p. 53, note 4, contends that the star first appeared to the
wise men two years before their visit, and a second time on their visit
to Bethlehem. (4) Besides, the star is said to have stood over "where
the young child was," v. 9. If it were a natural star it would have kept
going as they went, and would not have stopped till they stopped. Even
then it would appear as far away as ever from Bethlehem. It seems best,
therefore, to admit the existence of a miracle here, and hence gain
nothing from the visit of the Magi to establish the date of the
Saviour's birth, save that it was not long before the slaughter of the
infants, and would at least agree with the date 749. See Broadus, Comm.
_in loco_.

4. The language of the heavenly host in Luke 2:14 is urged by some as
fixing the birth at a time when there was universal peace throughout the
world. The closing of the temple of Janus in the time of Augustus is
also adduced, but it is not certainly known when it was closed apart
from 725 and 729. It was intended to be closed at the end of 744, but
was delayed on account of trouble among the Daci and Dalmatae. See
Greswell i. 469. Nothing specific can be obtained from this fact, save
that there was a time of comparative quiet in the Roman world from 746
to 752. There was a hush in the clangor of war when Jesus was born.

5. The entrance of John the Baptist upon his ministry gives us another
note of time. See Luke 3:1 f. John emerged from the wilderness seclusion
in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius. Augustus died August 29,
767. Adding fifteen years to this, the fifteenth year of Tiberius would
begin August 29, 781. John was of a priestly family and so could
naturally enter upon his work when thirty years of age. Thirty years
subtracted from this gives 751, as the date of John's birth. But that is
too late by two years to agree with the other date. Here, however, the
Roman histories come to our help. Tacitus, Ann. 1, 3: "Tiberius is
adopted by Augustus as his son, and _colleague in empire_." Vell. Pat.
2, 121; "At the request of Augustus, Tiberius was invested with equal
authority in all the provinces." So Suetonius Aug. 97 and Tib. 21. It is
clear, then, that Tiberius reigned jointly with Augustus about two years
before he assumed full control of the empire at the death of Augustus.
Luke could have used either date, but Tiberius' power was already equal
to that of Augustus in the provinces two years before his death. Luke
would naturally use the provincial point of view. Taking off the two
years from the joint reign of Augustus, we again come to the year 749,
as John was born six months before Jesus. So if John was born in the
early part of the spring, Jesus would have been born in the summer or
fall of 749.

6. The age of Jesus at his entrance upon his ministry, Luke 3:23. "And
Jesus himself, when he began to teach, was about thirty years of age."
So most modern scholars, taking the language in the obvious sense.
Origen refers it to the beginning of a new life, by the second birth of
baptism, after his spiritualizing fashion. The Authorized Version has
it: "And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age," applying
the "beginning" to the period of thirty years. McClellan argues that it
means "about thirty years, beginning"; that is, a little the rise of
thirty years. The Revised Version seems to be preferable and the only
doubt would be as to what is included in the phrase "about thirty
years." It has been variously argued that Jesus was from one to three
years younger or older than thirty. It seems more reasonable to give the
words the meaning that he was just about thirty, a few months under or
over. Apparently this fact explains the idiom. The argument that Jesus
had to be exactly thirty years old because the priest had to be so, when
he entered upon his work, has no great force. For Jesus was not a priest
save in a spiritual sense. John had been preaching no great while when
Jesus was baptized by him and so entered upon his public ministry. If
John began his ministry when he was thirty years old in the fifteenth
year of Tiberius, then Jesus's ministry would begin about six months
later. His birth would then come in the latter part of 749, unless John
was born in the latter part of 748, when it would be earlier in the
year.

7. The building of the temple of Herod gives a further clue to the date
of Christ's birth. In John 2:20, the Jews say, "Forty and six years was
this temple in building." Josephus tells us in one place that Herod
began rebuilding the temple in the fifteenth year of his reign, War. I,
21, 1, and in another that he did so in the eighteenth year of his
reign, Ant. XV, 11, 1. In the account of Herod's death, Ant. XVII, 8, 1,
he used two dates for his reign, according as he counted from his
declaration as king by the Romans 714, or the death of Antigonus 717.
Eighteen and fifteen would both be correct, according as he reckoned
from the one date or the other. Eighteen added to forty-six and both to
714 would make 778. It was at the first Passover in his ministry that
this expression is used. It has been probably six months since his
baptism. If thirty and a half years be taken from 778, his birth would
be thrown back to the year 747, unless the forty-six years be taken as
completed, when it would be 748. So Robinson. But this does not quite
agree with the other notes of time we have. Many modern harmonists count
the eighteen years from 717, and so bring the whole number, adding
forty-six, down to 780, or, if the years are complete, 781. Thirty and a
half from this would give the autumn of 749 or 750. This is done because
Josephus usually reckons Herod's reign from the death of Antigonus, 717.
On the whole it seems clear that Josephus is wrong in the War. It is
common enough to find Josephus in one passage contradicting what he has
said elsewhere. The temple was begun the year that the Emperor came to
Syria, as is plain from Josephus. According to Dio Cassius, LIV, 7, this
visit was made in B.C. 20 or 19. Correcting Josephus by himself and by
Dio Cassius we thus again get B.C. 5 as the probable year of the birth
of Christ. See Schuerer, _History of the Jewish People in the Time of
Jesus Christ_, Div. I., Vol. I., p. 410.

8. The census of Augustus Caesar mentioned in Luke 2:1 f., furnishes the
last note of time for this event. This subject is involved in a great
many difficulties, and for a full discussion, the reader is referred to
Ramsay's _Was Christ Born at Bethlehem_, and his _Bearing of Recent
Discovery on the Trustworthiness of the New Testament_ (Chap. XX) and to
my _Luke the Historian in the Light of Research_. Every statement made
by Luke in 2:1-7 was once challenged. Every one is now shown to be
correct.

(1) It used to be said that no census was ever taken by Augustus, but
heathen writers mention three, in 726, 746, 767. One of these, 746, may
be the one here mentioned, which was delayed for various reasons, or
which was executed slowly in the distant provinces. But it is not
necessary that the phrase "all the world" should be pressed to its
literal meaning, though this is more natural. Nor does the argument from
silence prove that no other general census was taken by Augustus. But
Ramsay has triumphantly vindicated Luke and the general census under
Augustus by proof from the papyri that Augustus inaugurated a periodical
census every fourteen years from B.C. 8 on. The second occurred A.D. 6
(Acts 5:37). See Ramsay's _Was Christ Born at Bethlehem_, and _Bearing
of Recent Discovery on Trustworthiness of the New Testament_ (Chap. XX)
and my _Luke the Historian_ (Chap. XX). We have only to think that there
was delay in the carrying out of the census in Palestine to bring this
date down to B.C. 6 (or even 5).

(2) It is not a "taxing," but an "enrollment" (Rev. Ver.) that was
taken. There was a taxing later (Acts 5:37). And if it were done while
Herod was king, Augustus could not have taxed Judea without Herod's
consent. But Herod was not now in good form with Augustus.

(3) This helps to explain another objection that the enrollment would
not have included Judea anyhow, because it was not yet a province, but a
kingdom. But it is not likely that Herod would have displeased Augustus
by refusing such information if it was desired. Tacitus asserts that the
_regna_, the dependent kingdoms, were included in the census taken by
Augustus.

(4) Hence, also, it is natural that the enrollment should have taken
place according to the Jewish and not according to the usual Roman
method, because Herod would wish it to be in accordance with the customs
of his kingdom. So every one went to his own city. We now know from
numerous papyri that in Egypt the family went to the home city. The Jews
were used to enrollment by tribes and that was allowed. See Deissmann's
_Light from the Ancient East_, p. 268, and Ramsay's _Was Christ Born at
Bethlehem_, p. 108.

(5) We now have to meet the objection that Quirinius was not governor
till ten years later, A.D. 6, when a taxing did occur. (See Acts 5:37.)

It is now possible to give a real solution of this problem. Luke is now
shown to be wholly correct in his statement that Quirinius was twice
governor, and that the first census took place during the first period.
A series of inscriptions in Asia Minor show that Quirinius was governor
of Syria B.C. 10-7 and so twice governor of Syria (second time A.D. 6;
Josephus, Ant. XVIII, 1:1). See Ramsay, _Bearing of Recent Discovery_,
pp. 273-300, and my _Luke the Historian_, pp. 127-9. Tertullian (_adv.
marc._ iv, 19) says that Sentius Saturninus was governor of Syria B.C.
9-6. But we now know that Varus was controlling the internal affairs of
Syria while Quirinius was leader of the army. Luke is therefore quite
accurate in his statement about Quirinius being twice governor of Syria.
The _Lapis Tiburtinus_ has _iterum Syriam_ about Quirinius. Ramsay has
cleared up this famous historical puzzle and has completely vindicated
Luke.

Few subjects have excited as much interest, even needless curiosity, as
the date of the birth of the Saviour. But it is noticeable that by the
masses of Christians more interest is taken in the day of Christ's birth
than in the year. The Christmas festivities and the natural desire to
make that the birthday of Jesus cause this widespread interest in
December 25. Not only is it impossible to determine with any degree of
certainty the day of the month, but the time of the year also is equally
uncertain. The chief thing that appears proved is that December 25 is
not the time, since the shepherds would hardly be in the fields at night
with the flocks, which were usually taken into the folds in November and
kept in till March. The nights of December would scarcely allow watching
in the mountain fields even as far south as Bethlehem. And besides, the
long journey from Nazareth to Bethlehem would hardly be made by Joseph
and Mary in winter, the rainy season. McClellan argues for December 25,
but his arguments are not convincing. The ancients had various days for
Christ's birth: May 20 (Clement of Alexandria), April 20, December 25,
January 5. Tertullian and others even say that the day of his birth
(December 25) was kept in the register at Rome. But chronologists attach
little weight to this testimony, since the same tradition puts the birth
of John, June 24; the annunciation of Mary, March 25, and Elizabeth's
conception, September 25--the four cardinal points of the year. If one
might hazard an opinion, it would be that the birth of Jesus occurred in
the summer or early in the fall of 749 or of 748, that is B.C. 6 or 5.
Turner (Chronology, Hastings D. B.) reaches B.C. 6 as the probable year
of the birth of Jesus though he did not have the new light on the census
and on Quirinius which confirms it. Hitchcock (Hastings D. C. G.) saw
the bearing of the periodical census that called for B.C. 7-5, but did
not yet know the discovery about Quirinius. Armstrong (Chronology New
Testament, Int. St. Bible Encycl.) is less certain about the precise
year.


_7. The Feast of John 5:1, and the Duration of Our Lord's Ministry_

It seems almost impossible to decide with certainty what feast is
alluded to in John 5:1. One can only speak with moderation where
everything is so doubtful. Various feasts have been suggested as solving
the problem.

1. The Feast of Dedication has been proposed by Kepler and Petavius. But
this view has met with no great amount of favor, for there is too short
an interval between the first Passover and December, when it occurred.
It might be a later Feast of Dedication, but this feast was not one of
the great feasts and would hardly have drawn Jesus all the way from
Galilee to attend it. He did attend this feast once (John 10:22), but he
was already in Judea at this time, having come up to attend the Feast of
Tabernacles (John 7:2, 14). So Robinson, Clark, etc. So this feast seems
to be ruled out of the question.

2. The Feast of Tabernacles is advocated by Ebrard, Ewald, Patritius. It
is very unlikely that the Feast of Tabernacles after the first Passover
could be meant, as the Saviour did not return to Galilee for some time
afterwards. He could hardly have come back so soon to Jerusalem. But the
Feast of Tabernacles after the Passover of John 6:4 is mentioned later,
John 7:2 f., which Jesus attended, it seems, because he was hindered
from going up to the previous Passover by the murderous designs of the
Jews. It is possible that the feast of John 5:1 may have been the Feast
of Tabernacles after a Passover not mentioned, and so would come after
the second Passover of his public ministry. But we do not know that
Jesus attended any other Feast of Tabernacles save the one in John 7:2,
which he may have done because he missed the preceding Passover.

3. The Feast of Purim, first suggested by Kepler, has had great favor
with modern harmonists, but apparently more on sentimental than on
scholarly grounds. Meyer says, "Without doubt it was Purim." But it is
by no means so certain as Meyer would have us believe. _(a)_ Meyer
relies on John 4:35 and 6:4 to show that this was the Feast of Purim
just before John 6:4. But the expression, "Say not ye, There are yet
four months and then cometh the harvest?" may be, and probably is a
proverbial saying indicating the usual length of time between sowing and
reaping, which, as a matter of fact, was about four months. Hence
nothing can be determined by this note of time. And, besides, the four
months could precede the Passover just as well as Purim, because the
sowing lasted a month or so. _(b)_ The Feast of Purim occurred a month
before the Passover. Is it at all likely that two circuits of all
Galilee were made in the meantime, besides much work of other kinds? See
Luke 8:1 and Matt. 9:35-38. The three general circuits throughout
Galilee, besides the mission of the twelve and a large part of their
training, the general statements about the Master's work of preaching
and healing, require an expansion rather than a contraction of the time
for this period of his ministry. It seems then quite unreasonable, when
once the mind takes in this enlarged conception of the missionary work
of Jesus, as recorded by the Synoptic Gospels, to limit it to the amount
of work mentioned by John, since he omits much of the early ministry,
because, it would seem, the others are so full just here. _(c)_ The
Feast of Purim, moreover, was observed at home in the synagogues, and
not by going to Jerusalem. See Esther 9:22 and Jos. Ant. xi. 6, 13. But
"the multitude" (John 5:13) seems to imply (Robinson) a concourse of
strangers at one of the great festivals. _(d)_ It seems hardly probable,
besides, that Jesus would go to any feast just a month before the
Passover and come back to Galilee and not go to the Passover itself
(John 6:4). Least of all would he do this in the case of Purim. _(e)_
The man who was healed at this feast was healed on the Sabbath (John
5:9), and this occasioned the outburst among the people. But the Feast
of Purim was never celebrated on the Sabbath, and when it came on a
Sabbath it was postponed. See Reland, Antiq. Sacr. 4, 9.

4. Pentecost is held to be the feast here alluded to by many early and
some later writers, such as Chrysostom, Cyril of Alexandria, Erasmus,
Calvin, Bengel, etc. Norris makes it the Pentecost after the first
Passover, but to do this, has to crowd into this short interval Christ's
first Judean ministry, the journey through Samaria together with the
first part of his Galilean ministry. So this idea has little weight.
McClellan argues that the allusions of Jesus in John 5:17-47,
"infallibly point to Pentecost," meaning the Pentecost after a second
Passover that is not mentioned. He further contends that this best suits
the chronological arrangement and the term "a feast of the Jews." This
view is certainly possible and cannot be positively disproved, although
it is not so "infallibly" clear as McClellan imagines.

5. The Passover has always met with many adherents, being the second
Passover in the Saviour's ministry and making four in all (John 2:13;
5:1; 6:4; 12:1). An unnamed Passover may exist in the ministry even if
not referred to here. The arguments in favor of this interpretation are
the most satisfactory. We cannot consider them as absolutely conclusive,
yet the Passover meets all sides of the case better than any of the
other feasts. _(a)_ The plucking of ears from standing grain by the
disciples (Luke 6:1) would indicate a time after the Passover and before
Pentecost. This incident appears to have happened after the feast
mentioned in John 5:1. _(b)_ It is fairly implied (John 5:1) that the
feast took Jesus to Jerusalem. The Passover would more likely be the one
to lead him there. It is expressly stated that he attended two Passovers
and a special reason is given for his not attending a third. If there
was another Passover in his ministry, this would naturally be the one.
_(c)_ This suits best the hostility manifested at this feast, which
would have time to become acute (Broadus' Comm. on Matt.) and break out
with increased vigor in Galilee and prevent his attending the next
Passover (John 6:4; 7:1). _(d)_ If this Passover be a second Passover of
the ministry, sufficient time is afforded for the great Galilean
ministry without artificial crowding. His ministry would be long enough
to allow the great work recorded as done by him. Only two serious
objections can be urged to this idea. (1) It is objected that the
article would be used with "feast," if the Passover were thus mentioned
as _the_ feast. But to this we can reply: _(a)_ The article is sometimes
omitted when the Passover is meant (Matt. 27:15; Mark 15:6). _(b)_ The
absence of the article proves nothing whatever one way or the other. No
conclusion can be drawn for or against the idea of the Passover. _(c)_
The article does occur in many manuscripts, including the Sinaitic, and
is put in the margin of the Revised Version. So nothing can be gained
against this theory here. (2) The chief objection is that Jesus would
not have remained so long away from Jerusalem, a year and six months,
from the Second Passover till the Feast of Tabernacles after the Third
Passover. But _(a)_ we do not know that he did not attend any other
feast in that time, for silence proves nothing; and _(b)_ a good reason
is given for his failure to attend the Third Passover, which may have
applied to the others, if he did not go, _viz._, the desire of the Jews
to kill him (John 7:1).

Hence it is natural that there should be a variety of opinions as to the
length of the Saviour's ministry, varying all the way from one to four
years, leaving out mere guesses based on five and more Passovers.
McKnight argues that the ministry may have lasted five or more full
years, since all the Passovers of Christ's ministry may not be
mentioned.

(1) The _Bi-paschal_ theory makes the time of the public life of Jesus
one year, allowing only two Passovers to the Gospel of John. Browne in
his _Ordo Saeclorum_ advocates this view. But the words, "the Passover,"
in John 6:4 must be omitted, and for this there is not enough
documentary evidence. If this could be done, Westcott thinks Browne
would make out a good case. But with the present text, his view cannot
be entertained.

(2) The _Tri-paschal_ theory finds only three Passovers in the life of
Christ. Hence the public work of Jesus would be from two to two and a
half years in length. This view is quite possible, as is shown in the
Harmony. These writers usually make the feast of John 5:1 Purim before
the Passover of John 6:4, or Pentecost after it.

(3) The _Quadri-paschal_ theory contends for four Passovers and a
ministry of from three to three and a half years. This theory follows
from making John 5:1 a Passover or Purim before or Pentecost or
Tabernacles after an unnamed Passover. This seems to be the more
probable length of the Saviour's public work on earth. How short a space
was even this to compass such a marvellous work. The ministry of Jesus
seems crowded beyond our comprehension. It would be certain that the
Saviour's public life lasted about three years and a half, if it was
admitted that John 5:1 referred to a Passover. Various writers seek to
find an allusion to the three years of the Saviour's ministry in the
Parable of the Barren Fig Tree (Luke 13:6), but this application of the
parable is by no means certain, since three might naturally be used as a
round number. But there can very well have been a passover not
mentioned. All we can say is that we know that the ministry of Jesus was
two and a half years in length with the probability of three and a half.


_8. The Four Lists of the Twelve Apostles_

It is interesting to compare the four lists of Jesus' chosen apostles as
given by Matthew, Mark, Luke, and Acts.

      Mark 3:16 f.    Matthew 10:2 f. Luke 6:14 f.     Acts 1:13 f.
   1. Simon Peter     Simon Peter     Simon Peter      Simon Peter
   2. James           Andrew          Andrew           James
   3. John            James           James            John
   4. Andrew          John            John             Andrew
   5. Philip          Philip          Philip           Philip
   6. Bartholomew     Bartholomew     Bartholomew      Thomas
   7. Matthew         Thomas          Matthew          Bartholomew
   8. Thomas          Matthew         Thomas           Matthew
   9. James the son   James the son   James the son    James the son
        of Alpheus      of Alpheus      of Alpheus       of Alpheus
  10. Thaddeus        Thaddeus        Simon the Zealot Simon the Zealot
  11. Simon the       Simon the       Judas the        Judas the
        Cananaean       Cananaean       brother of       brother of
                                        James            James
  12. Judas Iscariot  Judas Iscariot  Judas Iscariot

Let us examine the names here given.

(1) The lists are given some time after the selection was made, and
hence represent a later grouping according to later developments in this
inner circle. The primacy of Peter in these lists does not mean
necessarily that he was the acknowledged leader at first. See discussion
under (4) below. The point to note here is that we are not to think of
Peter as the formal leader of the Twelve before the death of Christ.
Jesus was himself that leader.

(2) One mark of an apostle was that he should have been with the Lord
from the baptism of John until the day that he was received up (Acts
1:21 f.). Perhaps no great stress is to be laid on any exact time here,
provided it began in the time of John. An apostle must know the Lord.
Hence Paul received the vision of Christ. We have some knowledge of
seven of these apostles before this time. If we infer from John 1:41
that John followed the example of Andrew in finding his own brother, it
was not long till James was a disciple as well as John, Andrew, and
Peter. Philip and Nathanael are soon added to the list (John 1:43 f.).
Later Matthew hears the call of the Saviour, too (Matt. 9:9; Mark 2:13
f). Of the other five we have no knowledge previous to this occasion.
Jesus had "found" them by the same insight that led to his other
selections. He chose Judas, though knowing that he was a devil.

(3) Observe the three groups of four, headed by Simon Peter, Philip, and
James the son of Alpheus, respectively. The great variety in the
arrangement of the other names makes this uniformity significant. It
seems clear that there are three recognized groups among the apostles
(Bengel, Broadus, Clark). Each group has the same persons in every list,
although there is such a variety in the order. In the first group
Matthew and Luke have the same order, while Mark and Acts agree. In the
second group Mark and Luke have a like order, while Matthew and Acts
agree in putting Matthew at the end of this group. In the third group
Matthew and Mark agree exactly, while Luke and Acts are identical save
the dropping out of Judas Iscariot from the list in Acts because of his
apostasy and death. No great importance can be attached to the precise
order within the groups since Luke, in the Gospel and Acts, gives a
different arrangement in the first and second groups.

(4) Observe also that Simon Peter not only stands at the head of his
group, but at the head of all the groups, while Judas Iscariot is always
at the bottom till he drops out entirely. Simon finally occupied a
position of precedence of some sort. He was one of the inner circle of
three that was so close to the Saviour's heart. Perhaps it was this,
rather than any notion of primacy in authority or power. He was the
spokesman because of his natural impetuosity. The question as to who
should be greatest among the apostles illustrates the spirit of rivalry
about precedence that existed among them. In the October, 1916, Journal
of Theol. Studies, Dr. A. Wright argues that the critical text in Mark
14:10 means "Judas Iscariot the first of the Twelve." The _Koine_ did
sometimes use _heis_ as an ordinal (see Moulton, _Prolegomena_, p. 96,
and my _Grammar of the Greek New Testament_, pp. 671 f.). But the
disputes among the Twelve show that they themselves considered Jesus
only as leader till his death. See my article on "The Primacy of Judas
Iscariot," the Expositor (London) for April, 1917, and one by Rendel
Harris in the June, 1917, issue, and Wright's reply in the November,
1917, number.

(5) There are among the Twelve three pairs of brothers--Simon and
Andrew, James and John, James the son of Alpheus and Judas the brother
of James. The first two pairs form the first group of the Twelve. It is,
however, uncertain whether Judas is the brother or the son of James. The
Greek is ambiguous, James's Judas. The Revised Version translated it
"Judas son of James," but the Epistle of Jude begins "Judas a servant of
Jesus Christ and brother of James." But the Jude of the Epistle and the
Judas of the Twelve were hardly the same. Cf. Broadus, Comm. on Matt.,
p. 216.

(6) There are some apparent discrepancies in the names in the various
lists. Bartholomew occurs in every list, but is generally understood to
be another name for Nathanael. Thaddeus is also called Judas the brother
of James. Matthew and Mark give Thaddeus, and Luke in Gospel and Acts
gives Judas the brother of James. It was a very common circumstance for
one to have two names. Lebbeus, given in some MSS. in Matthew and Mark,
is only a marginal explanation of Thaddeus. Both are terms of
endearment. Matthew and Mark again call Simon the Cananaean, while Luke
in the Gospel and Acts speaks of him as Simon the Zealot. But "Zealot"
is simply a translation into Greek of the Aramaic "Cananaean." Jesus
gave the other Simon the name "Cephas," which was translated into the
Greek "Peter," meaning rock. He is called by all three names in the New
Testament. Matthew likewise had another name, Levi, and Thomas was also
called Didymus, which was a Greek translation of Thomas, meaning "twin."


_9. The Sermon on the Mount_

Do Matthew and Luke record the same discourse? Let us consider the
several theories on this subject. My own view will be stated last.

1. Some hold that the two discourses are entirely distinct in time,
place, circumstances and audience. The arguments for this theory usually
presented are these.

_(a)_ The time of delivery of the two sermons appears to be different.
Matthew gives the sermon before his call (Matt. 9:9), while Luke
precedes his sermon by the call of the twelve. Hence Matthew's discourse
comes quite a while before Luke's in the early Galilean ministry. But it
may be well replied that, inasmuch as Matthew's arrangement in ch. 8-13
is not chronological, but topical, it is entirely possible, even likely,
that the same arrangement should prevail in ch. 5-7. It is perfectly
natural that Matthew, writing for Jewish readers and about the Messianic
reign, should give at the beginning of his account of that reign the
formal principles that rule in this new state of affairs, as proclaimed
by Jesus on a later occasion. In the early part of the ministry of
Jesus, besides, the hearers would hardly be prepared for so advanced and
radical ideas. Besides, Matthew makes no note of time whatever for this
discourse.

_(b)_ The place appears to be different. One is on a mountain (Matt.
5:1), while the other is on a plain (Luke 6:17). Hence the one is called
by Clark the Sermon on the Mount, and the other the Sermon on the Plain.
Miller (Int. Stand. Bible Encyclopaedia) is uncertain whether Matthew
and Luke report the same discourse and so discusses also Luke's "Sermon
on the Plain." But his argument is not convincing. If it is necessary
that "plain" here shall mean a place away from a mountain, down in a
valley, this would seem to refer to a different place. McClellan seeks
to show that Luke uses "and" in 6:17-20 by way of anticipation. He
presents for effective grouping events that happened after Jesus came
down out of the mountain before he gives the sermon delivered to the
whole body of disciples up in the mountain. This is possible, but
another interpretation is much more likely. The plain here is really
simply "a level place" (Rev. Ver.). So then the two accounts of Matthew
and Luke will harmonize quite well. Jesus first went up into the
mountain to pray (Luke 6:12) and selected and instructed the Twelve.
Afterwards he came down to a level place on the mountain side whither
the crowds had gathered, and stood there and wrought miracles (Luke
6:17). He then went up a little higher into the mountain where he could
sit down and see and teach the multitudes (Matt. 5:1). Matthew gives the
multitudes as the reason for his going up into the mountain. By this
arrangement any discrepancy between "sat" in Matthew and "stood" in Luke
disappears. Waddy has given an admirable arrangement of the material at
this point in Note C, p. xix. Many writers affirm that the tradition
mentioned by Jerome, making the Horns of Hattin the place where the
Sermon on the Mount was delivered, suits this explanation exactly. There
is a level place on it where the crowds could have assembled. It is not
necessary to insist that this mountain is the Mount of Beatitudes, nor
need we contend, as Robinson does, that the mountain must be very close
to Capernaum.

_(c)_ The audience is different. Matthew (4:25) states that his audience
was composed of "great multitudes from Galilee and Decapolis and
Jerusalem and Judea and from beyond Jordan," while Luke (6:17) says that
there was "a great multitude of his disciples, and a great number of the
people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and the sea coast of Tyre and
Sidon." Matthew says (5:1) also that "his disciples came unto him."
Hence both assemblages were composed of great multitudes from many
regions besides many of his disciples, but in neither case is Jesus said
to address himself to any save his disciples, his followers (Matt. 5:1
and Luke 6:20). So in both accounts the Saviour seems to withdraw a
little from the great outside crowd of curiosity seekers. But the
multitudes also must have heard something of what he said, for they were
astonished at his teaching (Matt. 7:28). Andrews well shows that the
audience in Matthew were not mostly Jews (according to Kraft), and the
audience in Luke mostly heathen. Matthew omits Tyre and Sidon, but he
had already mentioned Syria (4:24), which includes Tyre and Sidon.
Neither list may be complete. Hence nothing can be made out of Luke's
omission of Galilee, Decapolis, and beyond Jordan. Great multitudes from
the same general regions are alluded to as being present.

_(d)_ The contents are radically different. It is objected by Alford,
Greswell, etc., that Luke omits large portions of what Matthew has so
that Luke has only thirty verses, while Matthew has one hundred and
seven. But this leaves out of consideration the several large portions
of the same matter which Luke has placed elsewhere, or which Jesus
repeated on other occasions (cf. Matt. 6:9-13 and Luke 11:2-4; Matt.
6:25-34 and Luke 12:22-31). Jesus often repeated his sayings on other
occasions as all teachers do and ought to do. Neither evangelist gives a
complete report of this wonderful discourse. So Matthew omits some
things which Luke records (cf. Matt. 5:12 with Luke 6:23-6; Matt. 7:12
with Luke 6:31-40). Nor need we be surprised that Luke, writing
generally for all Christians, omits large portions towards the beginning
of the sermon that were designed especially for Jews (see Matt. 5:17-27;
6:1-18). These Matthew would be sure to record. Luke adds four woes to
the beatitudes. It is unnecessary to remark upon minor variations of
language, since the gospels manifestly aim to give the sense of what the
Saviour said and not the _verbatim_ words. The variations in the
Synoptic reports of the sayings of Jesus add much to the interest of the
narratives. Moreover, to offset these variations, which admit of
explanation, it ought to be remembered that the two discourses begin
alike and end alike, that they have a general similarity in the order of
the different parts, and that they show a general likeness and often
absolute identity of expression.

So these differences all melt away on careful comparison, and it is not
proved that there are two distinct sermons.

2. Another theory holds that the two sermons are distinct, but spoken on
the same day, and near together. So Augustine, who is followed by Lange.
The further points of this theory are two. _(a)_ The one (Matt.) was
spoken before the choice of the Apostles, to the disciples alone, and
while Jesus was sitting on the mountain. _(b)_ The other (Luke) was
spoken after the choice of the Apostles, to the multitudes, and standing
upon the plain. It is not hard to see that these points do not solve the
question. In Matt. 7:28 we are told that the multitudes were astonished
at his teaching and in Luke 6:20 that "he lifted up his eyes on his
disciples, and said." So this distinction vanishes. The question of the
mountain and the plain has been already discussed, and another more
probable explanation suggested. It is only a conjecture that the
discourse of Matthew was before the appointment of the Twelve. This
theory has had no great following.

3. Wieseler holds that Matthew has simply brought together detached
sayings of Jesus on different occasions and does not mean to present the
whole as one discourse; Luke's account being only one of the discourses
used by Matthew. But this violates the evident notes of place and
audience and surroundings by which Matthew gives local color and cast to
the entire discourse. See Matt. 5:1 and 8:1. The case of the grouping of
the miracles in chapters 8 and 9 is not parallel, since there Matthew
does not state that they occurred on one occasion. The fact that various
portions of this discourse are repeated elsewhere by Matthew is
immaterial, because this was a common habit of Jesus in his discourses.
Votaw in his exhaustive and able discussion of the Sermon on the Mount
in the extra volume in the Hastings D. B. admits the possibility of this
hypothesis, but considers it far less probable than the historical
reality of the Sermon as recorded by both Matthew and Luke. Moffatt
(Encycl. Biblica) considers it "a composition rather than an actual
address," while Bacon (Sermon on the Mount) admits only what is also in
Luke. Adeney (Hastings D. C. G.) holds to the essential integrity of the
address in Matthew.

4. Both Matthew and Luke give substantially similar accounts of the same
discourse. In that case we have a good illustration of the use of the
Logia in Matthew and Luke. Most of the arguments for this interpretation
have been mentioned in rebuttal of the previously mentioned theories.
_(a)_ This is the most natural explanation in view of the large volume
of similar matter in both, in the beginning, progress, and close of the
discourse. It is always best to give the Scripture the most natural and
manifest setting, when possible. _(b)_ This theory is the most probable
one, since it is hardly likely that Jesus would again make the same
sermon to the same audience, and under the same circumstances. _(c)_
There are no objections to this theory that do not admit of a probable
explanation. See the discussion above. The omissions and additions in
each case suit the specific purpose of the writer. The apparent
contradictions, when studied carefully, blend into a harmonious whole.
Hence we seem to be justified in maintaining the identity of the
discourses recorded by Matthew and Luke. For a careful outline of this
matchless discourse see Broadus on Matthew. Stalker, _The Ethics of
Jesus_, has a very able exposition of the teaching.


_10. The Combination of Luke and John_

We now have to deal with the most perplexing question in harmonistic
study, the proper disposal of the mass of material furnished by Luke in
9:51-18:14. McClellan discusses ten schemes, pushes them all aside, and
then suggests another which is no more convincing and equally
complicated. Nothing can be attempted here but a presentation of the
chief points in this endless discussion. All the principal plans for
arranging this part of Luke proceed on one or the other of the following
ideas:

1. Some hold that this portion of Luke is neither orderly nor
chronological. Hence many of the incidents, here recorded as apparently
belonging to the last six months of the Saviour's ministry, in reality
are to be placed earlier. They are put here as a sort of summing up of
things not mentioned elsewhere. So Robinson and others. In favor of this
theory it is urged that Luke here speaks of some things that Matthew and
Mark put before the third Passover, such as the healing of a demoniac
(Luke 11:14-36) and the blasphemy following. But it may be well replied.

_(a)_ It is not at all clear that we have here the same events that are
recorded in Matthew and Mark. Similar miracles were often wrought in the
Master's work and similar sayings were frequently repeated on similar or
different occasions. This was a common habit with him, as we have
heretofore seen.

_(b)_ This portion of Luke is his distinctive contribution to the
ministry of Christ in addition to his account of the nativity. He has
condensed his account of the withdrawals from Galilee, apparently to
make room for the description of another part of Christ's work. Matthew
and Mark almost confine themselves to the ministry in Galilee, while
Luke thus devotes the bulk of his narrative to what seems to be a later
ministry, after Jesus has left Galilee. It is hardly likely that this
account should be a mere jumble of scattered details.

_(c)_ Especially is this unlikely in view of Luke's express statement
(1:3) that he was going to write an orderly narrative. In no real sense
could this be true, if this large section is dislocated in time and
order of events.

2. Others refer the entire narrative (Luke 9:51-18:14) to the last
journey of the Saviour to Jerusalem to the Passover and see a triple
reference to the same journey arguing for triplications in Luke. Others
prefer to understand it as meaning the journey to the Feast of the
Tabernacles or Dedication. Some would combine this idea with the
unchronological plan noticed above. In favor of this journey being
continuous and the last one to Jerusalem, the following arguments are
adduced:

_(a)_ The language of Luke 9:51, "when the days were being completed
that he should be received up," implies that the end was drawing near,
and that he was setting his face towards Jerusalem to meet it. This is
true without doubt, for Wieseler's interpretation of "received up" as
meaning Christ's reception by man is entirely too forced. The expression
points to the end of Christ's earthly career. But what does the vague
expression, "the days were being completed," mean? Does it have to mean
only a few weeks? May it not include as much as six months? For we know
that Jesus had been instructing his disciples on this very subject
expressly and pointedly, and at the Transfiguration he had spoken of his
"decease." Henceforward this was the uppermost subject in his mind. So
the interpretation is correct, but the inference is not necessary. This
journey in Luke 9:51 need not be either just before the Passover or the
Dedication. It could be as early as Tabernacles and be thus described.

_(b)_ It is insisted that this is Jesus' final departure from Galilee,
the one described by Matthew and Mark. No place is allowed for a return
to Galilee after the departure in Luke 9:51. Robinson urges that Luke
9:51 naturally means a final departure from Galilee. But it may simply
mean that he left it as a sphere of activity, not that he never entered
Galilee again. And then Luke 17:11 expressly says that Jesus went
"through the midst of Samaria and Galilee." This means more than going
on the border between the two countries, as McClellan argues. He went
through some portions of Samaria and Galilee. In order for McClellan to
carry out his scheme he has to resort to the artificial device of
referring part of John 10:40 to the departure from Galilee, and the
other half to the Perean ministry after a diversion of considerable
length into Samaria and back into Galilee. So the effort is not
convincing to place all the material in this large section of Luke in
one last journey to Jerusalem.

3. The combination of Luke's narrative with that of John. Wieseler was
the first to point out a possible parallel between Luke and John. John
gives us three journeys,--the Feast of Tabernacles (John 7:2 ff.), the
journey to Bethany at the raising of Lazarus (John 11:17 f.), the final
Passover (John 12:1). Luke likewise three times in this section speaks
of Jesus going to Jerusalem, 9:51; 13:22; 17:11. Hence it would seem
possible, even probable, that their journeys corresponded. If so, John
7:2-11:54 is to be taken as parallel to Luke 9:51-18:14. This plan is
followed by various modern scholars.

According to John's chronology, Jesus was in Jerusalem at the Feast of
Tabernacles (7:2), at the Feast of Dedication (10:22), and at the
Passover (12:1). Just after the Feast of the Dedication we find him
abiding beyond Jordan, where John had baptized (John 10:40). From this
point he comes to Bethany near Jerusalem at the raising of Lazarus (John
11:17), whence he withdraws to a little town called Ephraim in the hills
north of Jerusalem (John 11:54). Here he abides awhile with his
disciples away from his enemies till he goes to the Passover. Such is
John's outline of these last six months of the Saviour's life.

_(a)_ But how is all this to be reconciled with the statement of Luke
(17:11) that Jesus went through Samaria and Galilee? If Jesus went back
to Galilee, John would have mentioned it, we are told. Not necessarily,
not unless it fell in with his plan to do so. Hence no conflict need
exist between Luke and John. Luke says he went through Galilee and John
permits it by the break in his narrative at 11:54. Various points in the
six months have been suggested as the point when the return to Galilee
was made. The most natural point is from Ephraim, whither he had
withdrawn (John 11:54). It was not far to go up through Samaria and join
in Galilee (Luke 17:11) the pilgrims from his own country who were in
the habit of going to the Passover through Perea, to avoid passing
through Samaria. This supposition is not improbable, as Robinson and
McClellan urge, but very natural; it makes Luke and John both agree, and
allows Luke 9:51 to mean that Jesus then left Galilee as a field of
operations. Various other theories are suggested for this return to
Galilee, but none of them appear as fitting as this one. It was just
before the Passover, when such a journey from Galilee to Jerusalem would
be made.

_(b)_ One other point needs to be considered. The theory we hold makes
the journey in Luke 9:51 identical with the one in John 7:2-10, _viz._,
to Tabernacles. Many hold such identity to be impossible because of
apparent contradictions in the narratives. Andrews makes three
objections against this identity: (1) That the Lord refused to go with
his brethren (John 7:6). But it was his brothers who were not favorable
to him that he refused to go with. He simply wished to avoid publicity.
His face was set (Luke 9:51) all the time, but he was not going with
them. (2) That the manner of the going is unlike; the one in John is
secret, while the one in Luke is public. But the secrecy in John may
merely mean the avoidance of the caravan routes and so through Samaria
(Luke). The messengers sent before were not to herald his coming to
gather crowds simply, but to make ready for him. It was needed, since
the Samaritans saw that his face was as if he were going to Jerusalem.
(3) That he went rapidly according to John and slowly according to Luke.
He does, according to John, appear in Jerusalem before the feast is
over, but Luke does not make him move slowly. Nor is it necessary to
connect the sending of the seventy (Luke 10:1 ff.) with this journey. It
belongs rather to the interval between Tabernacles and Dedication. So
the secret going of John and the going through Samaria of Luke agree.
John explains, 7:10, that Jesus rejected the advice of his brothers.
This theory is held irrespective of this being the final departure from
Galilee. It is not necessary to fill out every detail in this programme
and show where Jesus was between Tabernacles and Dedication. The main
outlines remain clear and harmonious and are fairly satisfactory. This
combination of Luke and John preserves the integrity of both narratives
and fills up a large blank that would otherwise exist in these closing
months of the Saviour's life. Upon the whole, therefore, this view seems
decidedly preferable, though nothing like absolute certainty can be
claimed in regard to the question.

We do not know what special source Luke had for 9:51-18:14. Some of it
may have come from the Logia (Q). Hawkins (_Oxford Studies_, pp. 55 ff.)
calls it "the Travel Document." Burton _(Some Principles of Literary
Criticism and Their Application to the Synoptic Problem)_ suggests "The
Peraean Document" and thinks that Luke may have drafted it early out of
oral material. But at any rate it is a great and characteristic portion
of his Gospel and adds greatly to our knowledge of Christ.


_11. Did Christ Eat the Passover?_

To put this question in another form, it would be, On what day of the
month was Jesus crucified? For the crucifixion occurred on the same
Jewish day as the eating of the meal recorded by all four Evangelists.
Nearly all agree that the crucifixion occurred on Friday and the meal
was eaten the evening before, our Thursday, but the beginning of the
Jewish day, counting from sunset to sunset. But what day of the month
was it? The Passover feast began on the 15th Nisan, the lamb being slain
in the afternoon of the 14th. But the day of the week would vary with
the new moon. If Jesus ate the regular Passover supper, he was crucified
on the 15th Nisan. If he ate an anticipatory meal a day in advance and
was himself slain at the hour of killing the paschal lamb, he was
crucified on the 14th Nisan. In that case he did not really eat the
Passover supper at all. So then we must seek to determine the truth
about this matter, because express statements are made about it in the
Gospels.

1. Some sentimental views of the question need to be disposed of first.
A great controversy once raged in the early churches about the Passover.

_(a)_ In the latter part of the second century some of the churches of
Asia Minor, largely composed of Jewish Christians, kept up the Passover
on the ground that Jesus had eaten it the night before his crucifixion.
Polycarp, the disciple of John, expresses the persuasion that Jesus ate
the Passover.

_(b)_ But some of the churches were afraid of this example and its
application to the discussion about the relation of the Mosaic laws to
Christianity. So they took the position that Jesus did not eat the
Passover himself, but as the Paschal Lamb, was crucified at the time the
lamb was slain. He was our Passover. The Greek churches now hold this
position, while the Latin churches hold that Jesus ate the Passover. But
those arguments are purely subjective and do not affect the question of
fact. Hence we waive this old-time controversy and come to the testimony
of the Gospels themselves.

2. The testimony of the Synoptists, Mark, Matthew, and Luke. The
evidence they give is abundant and explicit to the effect that Jesus ate
the regular Paschal Supper on the evening after the 14th Nisan.

_(a)_ Jesus predicted that his death would occur during the Feast of the
Passover. See Matthew 26:2, "Ye know that after two days the Passover
cometh, and the Son of Man is delivered up to be crucified." See also
Mark 14:1 and Luke 22:1, where the fact is alluded to. Passover is used
in the general sense of the feast of unleavened bread, as Luke explains.
The feast of unleavened bread followed the Passover meal, beginning the
next morning and lasting a week. But the one term was used to include
the other. The Passover was expanded to mean the entire feast that
followed, and _vice versa_.

_(b)_ It is true that the Jewish authorities decided not to put Jesus to
death during the feast (Matthew 26:5; Mark 14:2). But this decision was
reached not because of any compunctions of conscience in the matter, but
because they were afraid of a tumult among the people, owing to the
great crowds, many of whom were friendly to Christ. But so soon as Judas
offered his services, their fears vanished and they proceeded with their
murderous designs (Matthew 26:14; Mark 14:11). The rulers did expedite
matters at the crucifixion that the bodies might not be exposed on the
Sabbath. But they had often tried to slay Jesus on the Sabbath
heretofore. Public executions did take place during the feasts (Deut.
17:12 f.).

_(c)_ The Synoptists flatly say (Matthew 26:17, 20; Mark 14:12, 17; Luke
22:7, 14) that on the first day of unleavened bread Jesus sent Peter and
John from Bethany into the city to make preparations for eating the
Passover, and that on the evening of the same day he ate it with his
disciples. Luke calls it "the hour." Now, the first day of unleavened
bread was the 14th Nisan. There is no question about this. Josephus
speaks of the feast lasting eight days. The lamb of the supper being
slain on the afternoon of this day, it was regarded as the beginning of
the feast. Besides, Mark and Luke end the whole matter by saying that on
this day they sacrificed the Passover. Jesus himself calls it the
Passover (Luke 22:15). It is useless to say that Jesus ate the Passover
a day in advance. This could not be done, especially by one to whom the
temple authorities were hostile. Equally useless is it to say that the
Jews ate the Passover a day too late. If a mistake was made about the
new moon, they would hardly keep the Passover on two different days, nor
would Jesus be apt to make a point about the matter.

3. The testimony of John. If we had only the evidence of the Synoptists,
no serious trouble would ever arise on this question. Strauss has
strenuously urged that John is on this point in hopeless conflict with
the other Evangelists, since he makes Jesus eat the Passover on the
evening after the 13th Nisan (Wednesday), and not the evening after the
14th (Thursday). This idea has gained a foothold among many able modern
writers who see a clear contradiction between the Synoptics and the
Fourth Gospel. Some of these evidently do so because they hold that the
Paschal controversy in Asia Minor arose from this supposed conflict of
John with the Synoptists, and that this shows John's Gospel to have been
in existence when that controversy began. It is not worth while to
maintain that John in chapter 13 alludes to a different meal on a
different occasion. The points of contact with the Synoptists are too
sharp and clear, such as the sop given to Judas. But five passages in
John are produced as being in direct opposition to the statements of the
Synoptic Gospels. A careful examination of each of these five passages
in the Fourth Gospel will show that John does not say that Jesus ate the
Passover meal a day in advance of the regular time, but quite the
contrary.

_(a)_ John 13:1 f., "Now before the feast of the Passover, Jesus
knowing, etc." Here, it is alleged, a distinct statement is made that
this supper was before the Passover, and consequently twenty-four hours
before. But several things are taken for granted in this inference. One
is that the phrase "feast of the Passover" is to be confined to this
particular meal, and is not to include the entire festival of unleavened
bread (_cf._ Luke 22:1). Often by a metonymy of speech the name of a
part is given to the whole. Besides, it is not certain that verse 1 is
to be connected with verse 2. The best exegetes agree that a complete
idea may be presented therein, either a general statement that Jesus
loved his own before the Passover and until the end, or that he came
into special consciousness of this love just before the Passover. And if
the more natural interpretation be taken and the application of this
love be made in verse 2, it is not necessary that the "before" be as
much as twenty-four hours. Observe also the text adopted in the Revised
Version in verse 2, not "supper being ended," but "during supper." With
this reading agree the other references in 13:4, "riseth from supper,"
13:12, "sat down again," 13:23, "there was at the table reclining in
Jesus' bosom." So the natural meaning is that just before the meal
began, Jesus purposed to show his love for his own by a practical
illustration. So, after they had all reclined at the table according to
custom, Jesus arose and passed around the tables, washing their feet;
then he reclined again and proceeded with the meal. So nothing at all
can be made out of this passage against the view that this was the
regular Passover; but, on the other hand, the most natural meaning is
that John is here describing what took place at this Passover meal.
Else, why should he mention the Passover at all?

_(b)_ John 13:27, "That thou doest, do quickly." The objection is made
that the disciples would not have thought that Jesus referred to the
feast (13:29), if the Passover meal was already going on or was over.
So, it is urged, this remark must have been made a day before the
Passover was celebrated. But if that were the case, where would be the
necessity for hurry, as there would be plenty of time on the morrow? The
word "feast" here need not be confined to the paschal supper, but more
naturally refers to the whole of the feast, of which the supper was a
part. So this haste was needed to provide for the feast of unleavened
bread which began on the next morning. No real force lies in the fact
that this day was a holy day, being the first day of the Passover
festival. The Mishna expressly allows the procuring, even on a Sabbath,
what was needed for the Passover. If this could be done on a Sabbath,
much more could it be done on a feast day which was not a Sabbath. Hence
not only was it possible for the disciples to have misunderstood the
remark of Jesus on the Passover evening, but it was far more natural
that such misapprehensions should arise then than a day before. So this
passage, like the preceding, when rightly understood, really confirms
the Synoptists.

_(c)_ John 18:28, "They themselves entered not into the palace, that
they might not be defiled, but might eat the Passover." At first sight
this does look like a contradiction. For this was certainly after the
feast of John 13:2; and if they had not eaten the Passover meal, why
here is a clear case of conflict of authorities. But it is by no means
certain that the phrase "eat the Passover" means simply the paschal
supper. This phrase occurs five times in the New Testament besides this,
but all in Matthew, Mark, and Luke (Matt. 26:17; Mark 14:12, 14; Luke
22:11, 15). In all of these the reference is to the paschal supper. But
the word "passover" is used in three senses in the New Testament, the
paschal supper, the paschal lamb, or the paschal festival. The word is
used eight times in John besides this instance, and in every case the
Passover festival is meant. So we may fairly infer that the usage of
John must determine his own meaning rather than that of the Synoptists.
This becomes more probable when we remember that John wrote much later
than they, after the destruction of Jerusalem, when these terms were not
used so strictly. He always speaks of "the Jews" as separate from
Christians. And this very expression is used in 2 Chronicles 30:22, "And
they did eat the festival seven days." The Septuagint translates it,
"And they fulfilled (kept) the festival of unleavened bread seven days."
See Robinson. So it is entirely possible for the phrase, "eat the
Passover," to mean in this instance also the celebration of the Passover
festival. Some have urged that the Sanhedrin had not eaten the Passover
at the regular hour because of the excitement of the trial. But this is
hardly tenable. And, moreover, since this remark was made early in the
morning, how could that affect the eating of the supper in the evening?
For whatever impurities one had during the day passed away at evening.
Hence this uncleanness must belong to the same day on which it was
incurred. If the Passover festival had begun, this would be true, for
they would wish to participate in the offerings of that day. So this
passage likewise becomes an argument in favor of agreement with the
Synoptists.

_(d)_ John 19:14, "Now it was the Preparation of the Passover." This is
claimed to mean the day preceding the Passover festival. Hence Christ
was crucified on the 14th Nisan, in opposition to the Synoptists. The
afternoon before the Passover was used as a preparation, but it was not
technically so called. This phrase "Preparation" was really the name of
a day in the week, the day before the Sabbath, our Friday. We are not
left to conjecture about this question. The Evangelists all use it in
this sense alone. Matthew uses it for Friday (27:62), Mark expressly
says that the Preparation was the day before the Sabbath (15:42), Luke
says that it was the day of the Preparation and the Sabbath drew on
(23:54), and John himself so uses the word in two other passages (19:31,
42), in both of which haste is exercised on the Preparation, because the
Sabbath was at hand. The New Testament usage is conclusive, therefore,
on this point. This, then, was the Friday of Passover week. And this
agrees with the Synoptists. Besides, the term "Preparation" has long
been the regular name for Friday in the Greek language, caused by the
New Testament usage. It is so in the Modern Greek to-day. It was the
Sabbath eve, just as the Germans have Sonnabend for Sunday eve, _i.e._,
Saturday afternoon. So this passage also becomes a positive argument for
the agreement between John and the Synoptists.

_(e)_ John 19:31, "For the day of that Sabbath was a high day." From
this passage it has been argued that at this Passover the first day of
the Passover festival coincided with the weekly Sabbath. But that is an
entirely gratuitous inference. This coincidence would, of course, be a
"high day," but so would the first day of the feast, the last day, or
the Sabbath of the feast. In John 7:37 the last day is called "the great
day of the feast." The Sabbath occurring during the festival would be a
high day likewise. Robinson's arguments on this point are quite
conclusive. Nothing can be made out of the expression against the
position of the Synoptists.

McClellan discusses various other passages in John which show that the
crucifixion occurred on Friday, and that this was the first day of the
feast (John 18:39, 40; 19:31, 42; 20:1, 19, etc.). We conclude then that
a fair interpretation of the passages alleged not only removes all
contradiction between John and the Synoptists, but rather decidedly
favors the view that they have the same date for the Passover meal, and
that Jesus ate the Passover at the regular hour and was crucified on
Friday, 15th Nisan.

It is reassuring to note that David Smith (_The Days of His Flesh_,
Appendix VIII) reaches the same conclusion as that just stated. He makes
it out that Jesus ate the regular Passover meal and was crucified on
Friday 15th of Nisan and that the passages in John really agree with the
Synoptic account.


_12. The Hour of the Crucifixion_

In John 19:14 it is stated that the time when Pilate sentenced Jesus to
be crucified, or rather when he began the last trial in which he
sentenced him, was about the sixth hour. We read, however, in Mark 15:25
that it was the third hour when Christ was crucified. The Synoptists all
unite in saying that the darkness began at the sixth hour. The Jewish
way of counting the hours was to divide the night and day into twelve
divisions each, beginning at sunrise and sunset. The hours would thus
vary in length with the time of year. Just after the vernal equinox the
third hour of Mark would be about 9 A.M., and the sixth hour of the
Synoptists would be about noon. The ninth hour, when Jesus gave his
piteous cry to God (Mark 15:34), would be about 3 P.M. But how can the
sixth hour of John, the time when Jesus was sentenced by Pilate, be
reconciled to this schedule? A real difficulty is here presented, but by
no means an insuperable one, as Alford and Meyer hold. Let us discuss
some of the more usual explanations. Andrews and McClellan give quite a
variety of suggested solutions.

1. Some hold that "sixth" in John is a textual error for "third." This
could easily happen, since the gamma and the digamma of the Greek are
very similar. Eusebius said that the accurate copies had it "third" in
John. But the textual evidence is overwhelmingly against it, and,
besides, the difficulty would not be removed. John is evidently speaking
of the time at the last trial and Mark of the time after Jesus has been
led out to the crucifixion. So nothing is gained by this hypothesis. We
should still be confronted with the same difficulty. The change to
_third_ in John was a mere stupid scribal correction.

2. Others would change the punctuation in John 19:14 so as to make "of
the Passover" belong to "sixth hour," beginning from midnight. But there
is no evidence that the Passover began with midnight. So Hofmann. This
is very forced and unnatural.

3. Views that hinge on the word "preparation." Some would hold that John
simply says that about noon the preparation time of the Passover begins.
But Preparation here means Friday, and noon is not the hour needed to
harmonize with Mark. Equally arbitrary is it to count six hours backward
from noon so as to reach six o'clock.

Augustine suggested that the six hours are to be counted from 3 A.M.
This would make 9 A.M., and would concur with the hour of Mark. But this
is wholly arbitrary and unsatisfactory, and would not relieve the
trouble.

4. Equally arbitrary is the solution that makes Mark refer to the hour
of the sentence and John to the crucifixion, just the reverse of the
Scripture account. Augustine also proposed that Jesus was crucified at
the third hour by the tongues of the Jews, and at the sixth by the hands
of the soldiers.

5. Others hold that Mark and John both speak in general terms. Hence the
crucifixion may have taken place between 9 and 12 in the morning. Mark
looks in one direction and John in the other without aiming at
definiteness. The Jews, it is true, were not as exact in the use of
expressions of time as we are to-day, but this solution hardly meets the
requirements of the case. Mark puts his _third_ hour at the beginning of
the crucifixion, and John his _sixth_ hour at the beginning of the last
trial. This reconciliation does not reconcile.

6. The most satisfactory solution of the difficulty is to be found in
the idea that John here uses the Roman computation of time, from
midnight to noon and noon to midnight, just as we do now. Hence the
sixth hour would be our six o'clock in the morning. If this hour was the
beginning of the last trial of Jesus, we then have enough, but not too
much, time for the completion of the trial, the carrying away of Jesus
outside the city walls, together with the procuring of the crosses, etc.
All the events, moreover, narrated by the Evangelists, could have
occurred between dawn (John 18:27) and six or seven.

For a long time it was doubted whether the Romans ever used this method
of computing time for civil days. Farrar vehemently opposes this idea.
But Plutarch, Pliny, Aulus Gellius, and Macrobius expressly say that the
Roman civil day was reckoned from midnight to midnight. So the question
of fact may be considered as settled. The only remaining question is
whether John used this mode of reckoning. Of course, the Romans had also
the natural day and the natural night just as we do now. In favor of the
idea that John uses the Roman way of counting the hours in the civil
day, several things may be said.

_(a)_ He wrote the Gospel late in the century, probably in Asia Minor,
long after the destruction of Jerusalem, when the Jewish method would
not likely be preserved. Roman ideas were prevalent in Asia Minor. John
evidently is not writing for the Jews primarily, since he constantly
speaks of "the Jews" as outsiders. John is writing to be understood by
the people, and this is the way it would be understood in Asia Minor.

_(b)_ All the passages in John, where the hour is mentioned, allow this
computation. John 1:39 would be 10 A.M.; 4:6 f. would be 6 P.M.,
counting from noon also (as we do). This hour suits best the
circumstances. In the evening the women would come to get water, Jesus
would have time for his journey thither, and would be tired and hungry.
In John 4:52 the hour would be 7 P.M. This hour likewise suits the
circumstances better. John 11:9, Are there not twelve hours in the day?
is not against this idea, since here obviously the natural day, as
opposed to night, is meant. The Romans used both methods and so do we.

_(c)_ Moreover, one passage in John (20:19), when compared with Luke
24:29, 36, makes it necessary to understand that John used the Roman
method in this instance. It was toward evening, and the day had
declined, according to Luke, when Jesus and the disciples drew near to
Emmaus. Here he ate supper and, "rising up that very hour," the
disciples returned seven miles to Jerusalem and told these things to the
eleven who were together. But while they were narrating these things
Jesus appeared to them. Now John, in mentioning this very appearance of
Jesus (20:19), says that it "was evening on _that day_, the first day of
the week," _i.e._, evening of the day when Mary Magdalene had seen the
Lord. But with the Jews the evening began the day. Hence John, here at
least, is _bound_ to mean the Roman day. It was the evening of the same
day in the morning of which Mary had seen Jesus. This appears
conclusive. John did use the Roman method here, may have done so always,
almost certainly did so in 19:14. Besides, as McClellan shows, the
natural meaning of John's phrase is that it was the sixth hour of the
Friday (Preparation) of the Passover. But we have just seen that John in
20:19 counts according to the Roman day. Hence the sixth hour of Friday
would be six o'clock in the morning.

This is the only solution that really harmonizes John and Mark. The rest
make the hours agree, but the hours bring together different events.
This method harmonizes the whole narrative, and seems entirely probable,
if we can assume that the Romans or Greeks employed hours in this sense,
a point denied by Ramsay.

Sir W. M. Ramsay (_The Expositor_ for March, 1893, and Extra Volume,
Hastings D. B.) contends that Mark and John are at variance, but that it
is of small moment, since the ancients had little notion about hours. He
seeks to show that the martyrdom of Polycarp and Pronius, usually relied
on to prove that in Asia Minor the hours were counted from midnight,
took place in the afternoon, instead of the morning, the usual time.
Hence the eighth and tenth hours respectively would be 2 P.M. and 4 P.M.
Ramsay argues that, when hours were counted, they were always counted
from sunrise. He holds that John is more accurate about hours than Mark
and that hence Mark is in error. He agrees that John "stood on the Roman
plane" in the use of time, but denies that the sixth hour can be our 6
A.M. But the evidence is too uncertain for such a dogmatic position.


_13. The Time of the Resurrection of Christ_

1. Mark, Luke, and John say that the resurrection had taken place early
on the first day of the week, _i.e._ early Sunday morning. Mark (16:9)
says that Jesus, "having risen early, on the first day of the week,
appeared, etc." The position of "early" is ambiguous in the Greek and
the passage is disputed. Mark (16:2) states that it was very early on
the first day of the week, the sun having risen, when the women came to
the sepulchre. Luke (24:1) says that the women came to the tomb at early
dawn on the first day of the week. John (20:1) says that Mary Magdalene
came to the tomb in the morning on the first day of the week. So then,
there is no doubt that these three Evangelists mean to say that Jesus
rose very early on Sunday morning, and that shortly after that event
came the two Marys and some other women to anoint his body with spices.

Much objection is made to some of the details in the accounts of Mark
and John especially as being inconsistent. John (20:1) says that Mary
comes while it is yet dark, while Mark says (16:2) that the sun was
risen. But Mark also says in the same verse that it was very early,
which would agree with John's statement that it was yet dark. Hence
Mark's other statement, that the sun was risen, must be interpreted in
the light of his own words. Two solutions can be offered.

_(a)_ We may suppose, as McClellan and others, that John's note of time
refers to the starting from Bethany, while it was yet dark or very early
(Mark). In a few minutes it would be early dawn (Luke), and by the time
the women come to the tomb, the sun would be up. All this is entirely
possible and looks even probable, for in the twilight of early dawn, the
border line is very narrow between darkness and sunrise. A stiff morning
walk would pass through all the stages. It all depends on where you take
your stand in this fleeting interim. Mark covers both sides and so
includes it all from the first glimmering light till the full light of
day.

_(b)_ Or the expression, "the sun was risen" (aorist participle), may
simply be a general expression applicable to the phenomena of sunrise.
The first gleam of daylight comes from the rising sun, though not yet
completely risen. Robinson gives several examples from the Septuagint,
where the same phrase is used in the aorist tense in a general way for
the dawning light of day (Judges 9:33; 2 Kings 3:22; Ps. 104:22). Either
of these explanations is entirely possible and removes the difficulty.

2. But Matthew seems to put the resurrection on the evening after the
Sabbath, our Saturday evening. He says (28:1), "But late on the Sabbath
day, as it was dawning into the first day of the week, came Mary
Magdalene and the other Mary to view the sepulchre." If this passage
means that the visit was made at the end of the Sabbath day (evening)
and after the resurrection of Jesus, then Matthew is in plain
contradiction to the other Evangelists. Some have taken the position
that Jesus rose at sunset on the Sabbath day, forgetting that Mark
(16:9) says that he rose early in the morning. There are several ways of
reconciling Matthew with the other gospels.

_(a)_ Greswell, Alford and others would translate "late on the Sabbath
day" by "late in the week." The Greek word is the same in this verse for
Sabbath and week. In both cases, therefore, the translation could be the
same. But little sense would result from this translation. "Late in the
week" and "dawning into the first day of the week" hardly fit well. By
this explanation the latter expression is used for the first part of
Sunday and the visit occurred in this dawning part of the day.

_(b)_ Others would translate "late on the Sabbath day" by "after the
Sabbath day." Godet, Grimm and others contend that the Greek idiom could
mean this, and the _Koine_ allows it (Robertson, _Grammar of the Greek
New Testament_, pp. 645 f.). This rendering is possible, though the
papyri have instances of "late on" for this preposition _(opse)_, and it
is so translated by several English translators. Thus the Greek idiom
allows either "late on" or "after."

_(c)_ Matthew does not clearly say that this visit was made after the
resurrection of the Saviour although his words may mean that. Hence the
words may have their natural meaning as sustained by the papyri. Late on
the Sabbath day, about sundown say, the two Marys go to view the
sepulchre (Matt. 28:1), having rested through the day (Luke 23:56). The
women who had come with Jesus from Galilee had gone thither on Friday,
after his burial, to see where he was laid and had prepared spices. If
they went at nightfall at the close of the Sabbath (Matt. 28:1) "to see
the sepulchre," they could have bought spices after sundown (Mark 16:1).
Then (Mark 16:2) in the early morning, they rose and took the spices and
went to anoint his body. It was then that they saw the angel (Matt.
28:5). Matthew does not say that in the visit of 28:1 the angel appeared
to them. He speaks of the earthquake having come, and the resurrection,
and then resumes. This view gains some support from the use of the same
Greek word in Luke 23:54, "And it was the day of the Preparation
(Friday) and the Sabbath drew on (was dawning)." Here the meaning seems
to be that the Sabbath _dawned_ at the close of the day. So Westcott,
McClellan and others. However it may be about the visit of the women in
Matt. 28:1, Matthew certainly does not mean to say that Jesus rose at
sunset on the Sabbath. The whole course of his narrative in the rest of
the chapter shows that it was the morning of Sunday when the angel
appeared. While (Matt. 28:11) the women went to the disciples, the
soldiers ran to the chief priests (Matt. 28:13) and said that the
disciples came by _night_ and stole him while they slept, clearly
implying that it was now day. Hence Matthew does not teach that Jesus
rose at sunset, but the reverse. Besides, Matthew expressly says that
Jesus rose on the third day, which would not be true, if he rose on the
Sabbath.

_(d)_ Sabbath day may be used of the day followed by the night,
according to a possible understanding of the language. The Jews
originally counted from evening to evening, but this custom did not
prevail universally. Jonah (1:17) and Matthew (12:40) speak of three
days and three nights, following the day by the night. Meyer, Morison,
Clark and others hold this view, and it is possible, but certainly not
so satisfactory as the view given under (c). At any rate, it remains
clear that Matthew agrees with the other Evangelists in putting the
resurrection of Jesus Sunday morning. The chief point of difficulty is
Matthew's visit of the women in 28:1, whether this was in the evening
before simply "to view the sepulchre," or in the morning to anoint the
body of the Saviour. The condensed account of Matthew leaves this
question unsettled, and there we too shall have to leave it. And this
last matter does not affect the question as to the time of the Lord's
resurrection, but only the number of the visits made by the women.


_14. The Length of Our Lord's Stay in the Tomb_

Quite an effort is made in some quarters to show that Jesus remained in
the tomb seventy-two hours, three full days and nights. The effort seems
due to a desire to give full value to the expression "three days" and to
vindicate scripture. But a minutely literal interpretation of this
phrase makes "on the third day" flatly erroneous. A good deal of labor
has been expended in the impossible attempt to make three and four equal
to each other. There are three sets of expressions used about the
matter, besides the express statements of the Gospels about the days of
the crucifixion and resurrection. Let us examine these lines of
evidence.

1. Luke settles the matter pointedly by mentioning all the time between
the crucifixion and the resurrection (Luke 23:50-24:3). The burial took
place Friday afternoon just before the Sabbath drew on (Luke 23:54). The
women rested on the Sabbath (Saturday) (Luke 23:56), and went to the
sepulchre early Sunday morning, the first day of the week (Luke 24:1).
There is no escaping this piece of chronology. This is all the time
there was between the two events. Jesus then lay in the tomb from late
in the afternoon of Friday till early Sunday morning. The other Gospels
agree with this reckoning of the time, as we have already seen.

2. But how about the prediction of Jesus, repeatedly made, and once
illustrated by the case of Jonah, that he would rise after three days?
Are two nights and a day and two pieces of days three days? Let us see.

_(a)_ The well-known custom of the Jews was to count a part of a day as
a whole day of twenty-four hours. Hence a part of a day or night would
be counted as a whole day, the term day obviously having two senses, as
night and day, or day contrasted with night. So then the part of Friday
would count as one day, Saturday another, and the part of Sunday the
third day. This method of reckoning gives no trouble to a Jew or to
modern men, for that matter. In free vernacular we speak the same way
today.

_(b)_ Besides, the phrase "on the third day" is obliged to mean that the
resurrection took place on that day, for, if it occurred after the third
day, it would be on the fourth day and not on the third. Now it so
happens that this term "third day" is applied _seven_ times to the
resurrection of Christ (Matt. 16:21; Matt. 17:23; Matt. 20:19; Luke
24:7, 21, 46; 1 Cor. 15:4). These numerous passages of Scripture, both
prophecy and statement of history, agree with the record of the fact
that Jesus did rise on the third day. (Luke 24:7.)

_(c)_ Moreover, the phrase "after three days" is used by the same
writers (Matthew and Luke) in connection with the former one, "the third
day," as meaning the same thing. Hence the definite and clear
expressions must explain the one that is less so. The chief priests and
Pharisees remember (Matt. 27:63) that Jesus said, after three days I
rise again. Hence they urge Pilate to keep a guard over the tomb until
the _third day_ (Matt. 27:64). This is their own interpretation of the
Saviour's words. Besides, in parallel passages in the different Gospels,
one will have one expression and another the other, naturally suggesting
that they regarded them as equivalent. (Cf. Mark 8:31 with Matt. 16:21,
Luke 9:22 with Mark 10:34.) On the third day cannot mean on the fourth
day, while after three days can be used as meaning on the third day.

_(d)_ Matthew 12:40 is urged as conclusive the other way. But the "three
days and three nights" may be nothing more than a longer way of saying
three days, using day in its long sense. And we have already seen that
the Jews counted any part of this full day (day and night) as a whole
day (day and night). Hence this passage may mean nothing more than the
common "after three days" above mentioned, and, like that expression,
must be interpreted in accordance with the definite term "on the third
day" and with the clear chronological data given by Luke and the rest.
They seemed to be conscious of no discrepancy in these various
expressions. Most likely they understood them as well as we do at any
rate.

A LIST OF SOME UNCANONICAL SAYINGS OF JESUS


Some of the more important reported sayings of Christ are given which
are not found in the Gospels or Acts; whether true words of the Master
or not, it is not known. Some certainly are not like the Spirit of
Christ, but it will be of service to the student to compare them with
the genuine Words of Jesus in our Gospels. The Apocryphal Gospels are
passed by as not worth using in this list.


1. The Logia of Jesus (Grenfell and Hunt):

Jesus saith: Except ye fast to the world, ye shall in no wise find the
Kingdom of God; and except ye keep the Sabbath, ye shall not see the
Father.

Jesus saith: I stood in the midst of the world, and in the flesh was I
seen of them, and I found all men drunken, and none found I athirst
among them, and my soul grieveth over the sons of men because they are
blind in their heart.

Jesus saith: Wherever there are ... and there is one ... alone, I am
with him. Raise the stone and there thou shalt find me, cleave the wood
and there am I.

Jesus saith: A prophet is not acceptable in his own country, neither
doth a physician work cures upon them that know him.

Jesus saith: A city built upon the top of a high hill and stablished,
can neither fall nor be hid.


2. Readings found in Codex D.

One is concerning a man found working on the Sabbath, and comes after
Luke 6:4: O man, if indeed thou knowest what thou doest, thou art
blessed; but if thou knowest not, thou art cursed and art a transgressor
of the law.

Likewise Codex D has, after Matt. 20:28: But you seek to increase from
little, and from greater to be less.


3. Quotations found in various early Fathers.

From Barnabas: Let us resist all iniquity, and hold it in hatred. They
who wish to see me and lay hold on my kingdom must receive me by
affliction and suffering.

From Origen and others: Show yourselves tried money changers.

Ask great things, and the small shall be added to you; and ask heavenly
things, and the earthly shall be added unto you.

He who is near me is near the fire: he who is far from me, is far from
the kingdom.

For those that are sick I was sick, and for those that hunger, I
suffered hunger, and for those that thirst, I suffered thirst.

From Clement of Rome (Ep. II.): Keep the flesh pure, and the seal
unspotted.

When the two shall be one, and that which is without as that which is
within, and the male with the female neither male nor female.

If ye kept not that which is small, who will give you that which is
great? For I say unto you, that he that is faithful in very little is
faithful also in much.

From Justin Martyr: In whatsoever I may find you, in this will I also
judge you. Such as I may find thee, I will judge thee.

From Ignatius: Take hold, handle me, and see that I am not an
incorporeal spirit.

From Clement of Alexandria: He that wonders shall reign, and he that
reigns shall rest. Look with wonder at that which is before you. My
mystery is for me and for the sons of my house.

From Papias: The days will come in which vines shall spring up, each
having ten thousand stocks, and on each stock ten thousand branches, and
on each branch ten thousand shoots, and on each shoot ten thousand
bunches, and on each bunch ten thousand grapes, and each grape when
pressed shall give five and twenty measures of wine. And when any saint
shall have seized one bunch, another shall cry: I am a better bunch;
take me; through me bless the Lord.

In general the Later Judean Ministry and the Perean Ministry, chiefly
Luke's contribution to the Life of Christ, furnish many events and
discourses similar to those described in the Galilean Ministry. Sections
102 to 127 furnish most of the so-called "doublets" or repeated sayings
of Jesus or similar miracles. This is just what we should expect in a
popular teacher who journeyed in different parts of the country. Some of
these were real doublets, spoken by Jesus more than once. Others may be
grouped by Luke in a different place. We have no way to decide the
problem.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
